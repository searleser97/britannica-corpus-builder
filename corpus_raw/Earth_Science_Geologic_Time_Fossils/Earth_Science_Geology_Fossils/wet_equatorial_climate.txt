Wet equatorial climate,  major climate type of the Köppen classification characterized by consistently high temperatures (around 30 °C [86 °F]), with plentiful precipitation (150–1,000 cm [59–394 inches]), heavy cloud cover, and high humidity, with very little annual temperature variation. Wet equatorial regions lie within about 12° latitude of the Equator. The climate type is denoted by the abbreviation Af in the Köppen-Geiger-Pohl system.
Wet equatorial regions lie within the influence of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in all months; the converging, ascending air spawns convectional thunderstorm activity with much of the rainfall occurring in late afternoon or early evening when the atmosphere is most susceptible to thunderstorms. While precipitation is profuse in all months, variations do occur in response to the precise location of the ITCZ—drier months result when the ITCZ moves away from the region in question.
Other wet equatorial climate zones are found beyond the usual margins of ITCZ activity—in coastal Madagascar, southeast coastal Brazil, and much of Central America and western Colombia, where trade winds blow onshore all year. In these areas, trade winds encounter coastlines backed by mountain barriers that stimulate the formation of precipitation as warm, moist tropical air is forced to ascend and cool. Some of these regions also may receive precipitation from tropical disturbances, including tropical cyclones.
