Gerhard, Baron De Geer,  (born October 2, 1858, Stockholm, Sweden—died July 23, 1943, Saltsjöbaden), Swedish geologist, originator of the varve-counting method used in geochronology.
De Geer was appointed to the Swedish Geological Survey in 1878 and received a master’s degree in geology from Uppsala University in 1879. He studied the glaciers of Spitsbergen in a series of expeditions. He became a professor at the University of Stockholm in 1897, serving as president from 1902 to 1910. After retiring in 1924, he headed the Institute of Geochronology at the university.
De Geer observed that lake beds consist of couplets of laminated sediments (varves), light-coloured silt layers alternating with strata of darker clay. These represent annual accumulations and thus provide a means for dating the sediments simply by counting the number of varves present. De Geer also attempted to match or correlate varve sequences in widely separated glacial lake sites, but the validity of his conclusions about these sequences has been questioned by some authorities. He presented his varve method at the International Geological Congress at Stockholm (1910).
