Humid subtropical climate,  major climate type of the Köppen classification characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. This climate type is found on the eastern sides of the continents between 20° and 35° N and S latitude. Although the climate is made up of two subtypes (Cfa and Cwa), the Cfa subtype predominates.
In summer, these regions are largely under the influence of moist, maritime airflow from the western side of the subtropical anticyclonic cells over low-latitude ocean waters. Temperatures are high; the warmest months generally average about 27 °C (81 °F), with mean daily maxima from 30 °C to 38 °C (86 °F to 100 °F) and warm, oppressive nights. Summers are usually somewhat wetter than winters, with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunderstorm activity; tropical cyclones also enhance warm-season rainfall in some regions. The coldest month is usually quite mild (5–12 °C [41–54 °F]), although frosts are not uncommon, and winter precipitation is derived primarily from frontal cyclones along the polar front.
In North America, the spring and early summer seasons, when the front begins its northward return, are notorious for the outbreak of tornadoes associated with frontal thunderstorms along the zone of interaction between tropical and polar air. In eastern and southern Asia, the monsoon influence results in a modified humid subtropical climate (Cwa) that has a clearly defined dry winter when air diverges from the Siberian anticyclone, and the polar front and cyclone paths are deflected around the region. These areas generally lie on the poleward side of tropical monsoon (Am) and tropical wet-dry (Aw) climates and exhibit a somewhat larger annual temperature range than Cfa types. Winters are sunny and rather cool. Annual precipitation totals average about 100 cm (39 inches) but vary from 75 to over 200 cm (30 to 79 inches).
