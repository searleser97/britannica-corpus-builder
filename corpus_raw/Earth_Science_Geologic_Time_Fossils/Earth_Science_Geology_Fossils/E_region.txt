E region, also called Kennelly-Heaviside Layer,  ionospheric region that generally extends from an altitude of 90 km (60 miles) to about 160 km (100 miles). As in the D region (70–90 km), the ionization is primarily molecular—i.e., resulting from the splitting of neutral molecules—oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2)—into electrons and positively charged molecules. Unlike that of the D region, the ionization of the E region remains at night, though it is considerably diminished. The E region was responsible for the reflections involved in Marconi’s original transatlantic radio communication in 1902. The ionization density is typically 105 electrons per cubic centimetre during the day. Intermittent patches of stronger ionization are sometimes observed at the same general altitude.
