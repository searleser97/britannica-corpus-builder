Tropical wet-dry climate,  major climate type of the Köppen classification characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, with most of the precipitation occurring in the high-sun (“summer”) season. The dry season is longer than in tropical monsoon and trade-wind littoral (Am) climates and becomes progressively longer as one moves poleward through the region. The tropical wet-dry climate is abbreviated Aw in the Köppen-Geiger-Pohl system.
Temperatures in tropical wet-dry climate regions are high throughout the year but show a greater range than wet equatorial (Af) and Am climates (19–20 °C [66–68 °F] in winter and 24–27 °C [75–81 °F] in summer). In addition, annual rainfall totals are less than in the Af and Am climate types (50–175 cm [20–69 inches]), and most precipitation occurs as a result of convectional thunderstorm activity.
Throughout most of the region, the cause of the seasonal cycle is the shift in the tropical circulation throughout the year. During the high-sun season, the intertropical convergence zone moves poleward and brings convergent and ascending air to these locations, which stimulates convective rainfall. During the low-sun season, the convergence zone moves off to the winter hemisphere and is replaced by the periphery or core of the subtropical anticyclone, with its subsiding, stable air resulting in a period of dry, clear weather, the intensity and length of which depend on latitude. The subtropical anticyclone occurs in the descending portion of the Hadley cell.
