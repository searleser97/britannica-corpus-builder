Faunizone,  stratigraphic unit that is distinguished by the presence of a particular fauna of some time or environmental significance. It differs from a biozone because it is based on a fossil assemblage rather than a particular genus or species (compare biozone). The corresponding unit of geologic time is called a faunichron.
