Chalicotherium,  genus of extinct perissodactyls, the order including the horse and rhinoceros. Fossil remains of the genus are common in deposits of Asia, Europe, and Africa from the Miocene Epoch (23 to 5.3 million years ago). The genus persisted into the following Pliocene Epoch, and remains of a related genus, Moropus, are found in North America.
Chalicotherium and its relatives, collectively known as the chalicotheres, were very unusual in appearance and structure. In overall appearance the body and slim skull were horselike. The front limbs were longer than the hind limbs, and the back sloped downward. The teeth were distinctive in structure and unhorselike. The feet were quite distinctive. There were no hooves; instead, each of the three toes on each foot terminated in a strongly developed claw. It is probable that the development of claws was related to the feeding habits of the animal. Chalicotherium may have browsed on branches of trees, pulling them down with the front claws; the claws may also have been employed to dig up roots and tubers.
