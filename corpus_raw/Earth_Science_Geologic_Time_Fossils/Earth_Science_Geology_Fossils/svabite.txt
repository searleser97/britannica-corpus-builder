Svabite,   arsenate mineral, calcium fluoride arsenate [Ca5(AsO4)3F], in the apatite group of phosphates. Typical specimens are transparent, colourless prisms and masses, as at Pajsberg, Swed., and Franklin, N.J., U.S. The svabite series, also containing hedyphane (calcium and lead chloride arsenate), is usually considered to be intermediate between the apatite series and the pyromorphite series. For detailed physical properties, see arsenate mineral (table).
