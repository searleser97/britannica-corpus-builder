Nicolas Desmarest,  (born Sept. 16, 1725, Soulaines, France—died  Sept. 28, 1815, Paris), French geologist whose discovery of the volcanic origin of basalt disproved the Neptunist theory that all rocks were formed by sedimentation from primeval oceans.
From 1757 Desmarest was employed by the government to help spread better manufacturing methods throughout France. By 1788 he had risen to the post of inspector general and director of manufactures. In 1792, during the French Revolution, Desmarest was imprisoned and narrowly escaped execution; he was later recalled to government service.
In 1763–74 he studied the Auvergne of central France, where he found large basalt deposits that he traced as lava flows from nearby ancient volcanoes. His investigations revealed that many valleys are formed by the erosion of the rivers that flow in them. His numerous maps and essays showing the igneous origin of basalt were instrumental in reforming much of geological theory.
By the time he died, Desmarest had prepared four volumes of a planned five-volume work, Dictionnaire de géographie physique, which later appeared, with the posthumously edited fifth volume, in Encyclopédie méthodique (1781–1832).
