Primary mineral,   in an igneous rock, any mineral that formed during the original solidification (crystallization) of the rock. Primary minerals include both the essential minerals used to assign a classification name to the rock and the accessory minerals present in lesser abundance. In contrast to primary minerals are secondary minerals, which form at a later time through processes such as weathering and hydrothermal alteration. Primary minerals form in a sequence or in sequential groups as dictated by the chemistry and physical conditions under which the magma solidifies. Accessory minerals form at various times during the crystallization, but their inclusion within essential minerals indicates that they often form at an early time.
