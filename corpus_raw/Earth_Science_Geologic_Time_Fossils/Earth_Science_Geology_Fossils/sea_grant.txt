Sea grant,  a grant-in-aid to an American academic or scientific institution to enhance development of coastal and marine resources in the Great Lakes and the oceans around the United States. The sea-grant program was established by act of U.S. Congress in 1966 and was originally administered by the National Science Foundation; from 1970 it was administered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The sea-grant program is based in states near the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Great Lakes and also in Puerto Rico. In the mid-1990s it involved more than 300 institutions operating through about 30 core facilities, mainly universities. The program concentrates on research, education, and training in marine science, technology, engineering, economics, law, and policy. The results of the sea-grant program include such developments as a wave-powered pump that removes salt from seawater to make it potable, new drugs from marine organisms, compost from seafood waste, and the hybrid striped bass fish-farming industry. Public safety and the health of coastal ecosystems have also improved as a result of sea-grant studies, such as those examining nitrogen compound runoff, Great Lake contaminants, zebra mussel proliferation, and marine safety and lifesaving techniques.
