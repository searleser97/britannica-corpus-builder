Law of superposition,   a major principle of stratigraphy stating that within a sequence of layers of sedimentary rock, the oldest layer is at the base and that the layers are progressively younger with ascending order in the sequence. On occasion, however, deformation may have caused the rocks of the crust to tilt, perhaps to the point of overturning them. Moreover, if erosion has blurred the record by removing substantial portions of the deformed sedimentary rock, it may not be at all clear which edge of a given layer is the original top and which is the original bottom. The law of superposition was formulated by Danish geologist Nicolaus Steno and outlined in his book De Solido Intra Naturaliter Contento Dissertationis Prodomus (1669; The Prodromus of Nicolaus Stenoâ€™s Dissertation Concerning a Solid Body Enclosed by Process of Nature Within a Solid). It is one of the great general principles of geology.
