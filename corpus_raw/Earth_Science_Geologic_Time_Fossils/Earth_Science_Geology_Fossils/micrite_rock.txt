Micrite,  sedimentary rock formed of calcareous particles ranging in diameter from 0.06 to 2 mm (0.002 to 0.08 inch) that have been deposited mechanically rather than from solution. The particles, which consist of fossil materials, pebbles and granules of carbonate rock, and o√∂lites (spherical nodules with concentric structure), are transported and sorted by flowing water. When formed almost entirely of shell debris, the rock is termed coquina (q.v.). Coquinite is the consolidated equivalent.
