Nodule,   rounded mineral concretion that is distinct from, and may be separated from, the formation in which it occurs. Nodules commonly are elongate with a knobby irregular surface; they usually are oriented parallel to the bedding.
Chert and flint often occur as dense and structureless nodules of nearly pure silica in limestone or chalk, where they seem to be replacements of the carbonate rock by silica. Clay ironstone, a mixture of clay and siderite (iron carbonate), sometimes occurs as layers of dark-gray to brown, fine-grained nodules overlying coal seams. Phosphorites, massive phosphate rocks, often occur in phosphate deposits, in some limestones and chalks, and on the present sea bottom as black, fine-grained, and dense nodules with an elliptical shape and no structure.
