Chatoyance,   the property of some minerals to exhibit a wavy, luminous band with a silky lustre, reminiscent of the eye of a cat, in the centre of a cabochon-cut (polished, with a rounded, unfaceted convex surface) stone. The effect, caused by parallel fibres or by oriented imperfections or inclusions within the stone, is typical of catâ€™s-eye, tigereye, satin spar, and bronzite. The fibres, imperfections, or inclusions are oriented along a crystallographic axis; it is this same kind of orientation, but along three axes, that accounts for the asterism of star sapphire and ruby.
