Wedekindellina,  genus of fusulinid foraminiferans, an extinct group of protozoans that possessed a hard shell of relatively large size; they are especially characteristic as fossils in deposits from the Pennsylvanian Subperiod (318 million to 299 million years ago) of midcontinental North America. The several species that are known serve as excellent guide, or index, fossils and enable Late Carboniferous time and rocks to be divided into smaller units.
