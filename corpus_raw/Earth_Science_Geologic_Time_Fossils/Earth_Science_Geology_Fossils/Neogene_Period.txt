Neogene Period,  the second of three divisions of the Cenozoic Era. The Neogene Period encompasses the interval between 23 million and 2.6 million years ago and includes the Miocene (23 million to 5.3 million years ago) and the Pliocene (5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago) epochs. The Neogene, which means “new born,” was designated as such to emphasize that the marine and terrestrial fossils found in the strata of this time were more closely related to each other than to those of the preceding period, called the Paleogene (66 million to 23 million years ago). The term Neogene is widely used in Europe as a geologic division, and it is increasingly employed in North America, where the Cenozoic Era has traditionally been divided into the Tertiary Period (66 million to 2.6 million years ago) and the Quaternary Period (2.6 million years ago to the present).
