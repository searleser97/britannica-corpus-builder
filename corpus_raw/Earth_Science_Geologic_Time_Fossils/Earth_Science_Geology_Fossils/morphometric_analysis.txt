Morphometric analysis,  quantitative description and analysis of landforms as practiced in geomorphology that may be applied to a particular kind of landform or to drainage basins and large regions generally. Formulas for right circular cones have been fitted to the configurations of alluvial fans, logarithmic spirals have been used to describe certain shapes of beaches, and drumlins, spoon-shaped glacial landforms, have been found to accord to the form of the lemniscate curve. With regard to drainage basins, many quantitative measures have been developed to describe valley side and channel slopes, relief, area, drainage network type and extent, and other variables. Attempts to correlate statistically parameters defining drainage basin characteristics and basin hydrology, as in studies of sediment yield, are generally designated as morphometric analyses.
