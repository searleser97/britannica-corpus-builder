Paleogeology, also spelled Palaeogeology,  the geology of a region at any given time in the distant past. Paleogeologic reconstructions in map form show not only the ancient topography of a region but also the distribution of rocks beneath the surface and such structural features as faults and folds. Maps of this kind help investigators to better determine the instances of deformation events in a region, the stream-drainage patterns now buried under layers of sediment, and the extent of ancient oceans and seas. They also provide a useful tool for petroleum geologists, enabling them to identify geologic structures where oil or natural gas may be trapped.
