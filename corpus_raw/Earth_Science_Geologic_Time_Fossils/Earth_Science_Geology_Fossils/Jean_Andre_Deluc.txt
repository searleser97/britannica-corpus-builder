Jean André Deluc,  (born Feb. 8, 1727, Geneva, Switz.—died  Nov. 7, 1817, Windsor, Berkshire, Eng.), Swiss-born British geologist and meteorologist whose theoretical work was influential on 19th-century writing about meteorology.
Deluc was educated in mathematics and the natural sciences. He engaged in business, and on his business travels around Europe he collected mineral and plant specimens.
Deluc suffered business reverses in 1773 and left Geneva for England. He devoted himself to his scientific interests and was made a fellow of the Royal Society. He became a reader to Queen Charlotte, which allowed him much time and the means to travel on the European continent. He studied the effects of heat and pressure on the mercury barometer and, as a pioneer in scientific mountaineering, published the first correct rules for using the barometer to find the heights of mountains.
Deluc discovered that water attains its maximum density at 39° F (4° C), and he developed the theory that the quantity of water vapour in any given space is independent of the density of the air in which it is diffused. As an amateur physicist, he constructed an “electric column” of zinc and silvered paper similar to the galvanic pile of Alessandro Volta, which was in vogue for electrical experimentation for some time. Deluc’s keenest personal interest was his quest to reconcile the Creation story of Genesis with the evidence of geology, and to this end he interpreted each day of the Creation as an epoch.
