Dew point,  the temperature at which the atmosphere is saturated with water vapour, when it is cooled without changing its pressure or vapour content. A given volume of air containing much water vapour has a higher dew point than the same volume of drier air; thus the dew point gives an indication of the humidity. In meteorology the dew point is applied, for example, in predicting the height of the base of certain types of clouds.
