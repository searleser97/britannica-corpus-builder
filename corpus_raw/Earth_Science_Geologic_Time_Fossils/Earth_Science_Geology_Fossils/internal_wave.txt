Internal wave,  a type of gravity wave that occurs on internal “surfaces” within ocean waters. These surfaces represent strata of rapidly changing water density with increasing depth, and the associated waves are called internal waves. Internal waves manifest themselves by a regular rising and sinking of the water layers on which they centre, whereas the height of the sea surface is hardly affected at all.
Because the restoring force, excited by the internal deformation of the water layers of equal density, is much smaller than in the case of surface waves, internal waves are much slower than the latter. Given the same wavelength, the period is much longer (the movements of the water particles being much more sluggish), and the speed of propagation is much smaller; the formulas for the speed of surface waves include the acceleration of gravity, g, but those for internal waves include the gravity factor times the difference between the densities of the upper and the lower water layer divided by their sum.
The cause of internal waves may lie in the action of tidal forces (the period then equaling the tidal period) or in the action of a wind or pressure fluctuation. Sometimes, a ship may cause internal waves (dead water) if there is a shallow, brackish upper layer.
