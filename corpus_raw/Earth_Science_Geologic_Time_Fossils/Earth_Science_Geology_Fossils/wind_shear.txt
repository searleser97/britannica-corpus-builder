Wind shear,  rapid change in wind velocity or direction. A very narrow zone of abrupt velocity change is known as a shear line. Wind shear is observed both near the ground and in jet streams, where it may be associated with clear-air turbulence. Vertical wind shear that causes turbulence is closely associated with the vertical and horizontal transport of momentum, heat, and water vapour.
