Eusthenopteron,  genus of extinct lobe-finned fishes (crossopterygians) preserved as fossils in rocks of the late Devonian Period (about 370 million years ago). Eusthenopteron was near the main line of evolution leading to the first terrestrial vertebrates, the tetrapods. It was 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6 feet) long and was an active carnivore, with numerous small teeth in its broad skull.
The overall pattern of the skull bones is similar to that of early tetrapods, but the vertebral column was not very well developed in that the vertebral arches were not strongly fused to the vertebral spools, and the arches did not interlock between vertebrae, as they do in tetrapods. The shoulder girdle was still attached to the skull, but the hip girdle was only rudimentary and was not attached to the vertebral column. The fleshy fins had a series of stout bones supporting them, including elements that correspond to the limb bones of modern land vertebrates—the humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibia, and fibula. However, the limbs ended in a series of bony rays much like those supporting the fins of ray-finned fishes (actinopterygians) today. Eusthenopteron was not built for land life; rather, it seems to have lived in shallow fresh to brackish waterways, where it could have clambered among rocks and plants in search of food.  It obtained oxygen in two ways—by breathing it from the air with its lungs and by absorbing it from the water through its gills.
