Tachylyte, also spelled tachylite,  glassy igneous rocks low in silica, such as basalt or diabase. Tachylytes are black with a pitchlike or resinous lustre; in thin sections they are characteristically brown and translucent, and the glass is crowded with granules of magnetite. Tachylytes are found only under conditions that imply rapid cooling, and they are much less common than are the corresponding acid volcanic glasses, principally because of the greater fluidity and greater tendency of basic lavas to crystallize.
The principal mode of occurrence of tachylyte is as a chilled edge to thin dikes or sills of basalt or diabase; this edge may be only a millimetre or so thick and merges inward into crystalline basalt. Tachylytes of this nature are common among the igneous rocks of early Cenozoic age in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Sometimes tachylyte constitutes almost entire lava flows, as in the Hawaiian Islands; the rapid cooling of the highly fluid lavas of this region has inhibited crystallization, giving rise to vast floods of basaltic glass that contains only minor amounts of crystalline material. Lastly, tachylytes occur as scoria, or bombs, thrown out by basaltic volcanoes; these are well known at Stromboli Island and at Mount Etna in Italy, and in Iceland. Tachylytes readily undergo weathering and alteration and are converted by oxidation and hydration into palagonite, a red, brown, or yellow cryptocrystalline material.
