Polygnathiform,   conodont, or small toothlike fossil of uncertain relationship found widely in ancient marine rocks, that resembles or may be derived from the genus Polygnathus, a genus found in rocks of Early Devonian to Early Carboniferous age (the Devonian Period lasted from 408 to 360 million years ago and was followed by the Carboniferous Period). Polygnathus is clearly a key conodont genus; from this form a wide variety of distinct conodont genera evolved, including many forms that are important index, or guide, fossils.
