Polar front,  in meteorology, the transition region separating warmer tropical air from colder polar air in the mid-latitudes. This region possesses a strong temperature gradient, and thus it is a reservoir of potential energy that can be readily tapped and converted into the kinetic energy associated with extratropical cyclones. Extratropical cyclone tracks are displaced farther northward in July, reflecting the more northward position of the polar front in summer.
Members of the Bergen school, founded by Norwegian meteorologist and physicist Vilhelm Bjerknes, first proposed the concept of the polar front. They formulated a model for a cyclone that forms as a disturbance along a zone of strong temperature contrast known as a front, which in turn constitutes a boundary between two contrasting air masses. In this model the masses of polar and mid-latitude air around the globe are separated by the polar front.
