Periglaciology,   study of the large areas of the Earth that were adjacent to but not covered by ice during the glacial periods. Modern representatives of these areas are the sub-Arctic tundra and permafrost regions located in the Northern Hemisphere. All of the conditions derived from such a paleoenvironment can be observed in the geologic record preserved in many areas now free of ice.
