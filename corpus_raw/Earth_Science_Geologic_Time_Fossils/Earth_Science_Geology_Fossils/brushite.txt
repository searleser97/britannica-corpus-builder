Brushite,  rare mineral, a hydrated calcium phosphate (CaHPO4Â·2H2O), that forms colourless to pale-yellow, transparent to translucent efflorescences or tiny crystals. It occurs in small quantities in many phosphate deposits, particularly as an incrustation on ancient bones and as a decomposition product of guano (seafowl excrement). It dehydrates readily to form monetite. Brushite is found on Bird Island, Venez. For detailed physical properties, see phosphate mineral (table).
