Burgess Shale,  fossil formation containing remarkably detailed traces of soft-bodied biota of the Middle Cambrian Epoch (520 to 512 million years ago). Collected from a fossil bed in the Burgess Pass of the Canadian Rockies, the Burgess Shale is one of the best preserved and most important fossil formations in the world. Since it was discovered in 1909, over 60,000 specimens have been retrieved from the bed.
The Burgess Shale captures a complex marine environment containing a rich diversity of arthropods, miscellaneous worms, sponges, lophophorates, echinoderms, mollusks, priapulids, chordates, hemichordates, annelids, and coelenterates. The fossil bed is likely the result of mud slides from the Laurentian shelf that rapidly buried the fauna, preserving great morphological detail. While many of the fossils clearly belong to established phyla and reveal important information about phylogenetic development, there are many other genera that do not fit so easily into modern phyla. Such unusual fossils as Hallucigenia, a creature with a long tubular body and two rows of tall dorsal spines; Wiwaxia, an oval creature with two rows of spines down its plated back; and Opabinia, which had five eyes and a long nozzle, have led many scientists to conclude that the Cambrian Period may have produced many unique phyla. However, deposits discovered in China, Greenland, and elsewhere have demonstrated that at least some of the shale’s oddities (including Hallucigenia and Wiwaxia) belong to known groups of animals—though they were members of lineages that diverged early from the others and soon became extinct—and that the Burgess Shale is unique in preservation, but probably not in composition.
