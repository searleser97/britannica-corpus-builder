Archosaurus,  early genus of reptiles found as fossils in Middle and Late Permian deposits of Europe (265 million to 251 million years ago). Archosaurus typifies the progressive changes occurring in reptilian structure that eventually led to their dominance as the major vertebrates. A clear trend was in the modification of the limbs and the pelvis.
