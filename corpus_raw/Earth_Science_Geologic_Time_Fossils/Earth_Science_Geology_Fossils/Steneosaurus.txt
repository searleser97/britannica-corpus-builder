Steneosaurus,  (genus Steneosaurus),  extinct crocodiles that inhabited shallow seas and whose fossils are found in sediments of the Jurassic Period (200 million to 146 million years ago) in South America, Europe, and North Africa. The skull of Steneosaurus was very light and narrow, with large openings and a long and narrow snout. The nostrils were at the tip of the snout and connected to the throat by a long bony tube. Many sharp teeth were present, which were probably used to eat fish.
