Metacinnabar,   a mercury sulfide mineral that has the same chemical composition as cinnabar (HgS). Typical specimens have been obtained from Italy, Romania, and California. A member of the sphalerite group of sulfide minerals having isometric crystal symmetry, metacinnabar is transformed to cinnabar, a more stable form, upon heating to 400°–550° C (750°–1,020° F). For detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
