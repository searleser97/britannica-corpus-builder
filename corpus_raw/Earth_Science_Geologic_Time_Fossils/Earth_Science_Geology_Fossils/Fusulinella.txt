Fusulinella,   genus of extinct fusulinid foraminiferans (protozoans with a shell) found as fossils in Late Carboniferous marine rocks (those formed between 320 and 286 million years ago). Because of its narrow time range and wide geographic distribution, Fusulinella is an excellent guide fossil for Late Carboniferous rocks and time.
