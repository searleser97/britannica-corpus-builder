Obsidian–hydration–rind dating,  method of age determination of obsidian (black volcanic glass) that makes use of the fact that obsidian freshly exposed to the atmosphere will take up water to form a hydrated surface layer with a density and refractive index different from that of the remainder of the obsidian. The thickness of the layer can be determined by microscopic examination of a thin section of the sample cut at right angles to the surface. The hydration–rind dating technique also has been used to date glassy rhyolitic flows that have erupted more than 200 years ago but less than 200,000 years ago.
