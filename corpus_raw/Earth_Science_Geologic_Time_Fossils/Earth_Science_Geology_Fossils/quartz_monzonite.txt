Quartz monzonite, also called adamellite,  intrusive igneous rock (solidified from a liquid state) that contains plagioclase feldspar, orthoclase feldspar, and quartz. It is abundant in the large batholiths (great masses of igneous rocks mostly deep below the surface) of the worldâ€™s mountain belts. Quartz monzonite differs from granodiorite by containing more alkali feldspar, usually more biotite and less hornblende, and oligoclase instead of andesine as the plagioclase mineral.
