Indricotherium, also called Paraceratherium, formerly Baluchitherium,  genus of giant browsing perissodactyls found as fossils in Asian deposits of the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene epochs (30 million to 16.6 million years ago). Indricotherium, which was related to the modern rhinoceros but was hornless, was the largest land mammal that ever existed. It stood about 5.5 metres (18 feet) high at the shoulder, was 8 metres (26 feet) long, and weighed an estimated 30 tons, which is more than four times the weight of the modern elephant. Its skull, small in proportion to its body, was more than 1.2 metres (4 feet) in length. Indricotherium had relatively long front legs and a long neck; thus, it was probably able to browse on the leaves and branches of trees. Its limbs were massive and strongly constructed.
