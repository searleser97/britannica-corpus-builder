Inyoite,   a colourless and transparent borate mineral (CaB3O3(OH)5Â·4H2O) that occurs as massive granular or sperulitic aggregates in borate deposits. The structure of the mineral consists of two BO2(OH)2 tetrahedrons and a BO2OH triangle linked by calcium and hydroxyl-hydrogen bonds. Inyoite alters by partial dehydration to meyerhofferite and colemanite, both of which are used as raw materials for borax and other boron-related products. Originally found near Death Valley, in Inyo county, Calif., U.S., inyoite has also been discovered lining gypsum deposits at Hillsborough, N.B., Can., and in western Kazakhstan. For detailed physical properties, see borate mineral (table).
