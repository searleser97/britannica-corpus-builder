Euparkeria,  extinct genus of reptile very closely related to the ancestral archosaurs (a group containing present-day crocodiles and birds and ancestral dinosaurs and pterosaurs). Specimens are found as fossils in Middle Triassic rocks of South Africa (245 to 240 million years ago). Euparkeria was about 1 metre (3 feet) long and lightly built. It probably  progressed on all four limbs or on only two back limbs. Like other archosaurs, Euparkeria had an opening in the skull between its eyes and nasal breach (the antorbital opening) and two additional apertures in the skull behind one eye (the upper and lower temporal openings). Its teeth were set in sockets, rather than being attached to the side of the jawbone or perched atop it. These teeth were long, sharp, and recurved, which attested to the carnivorous habit that seems to have been common among the first archosaurs. Euparkeria also possessed teeth on its palate, which was also common among earlier reptiles and amphibians.
