Venyukovia, also spelled Venjukovia,  genus of extinct mammallike reptiles (therapsids) that are found as fossils in Permian deposits in eastern Europe (the Permian Period began 299,000,000 years ago and lasted 48,000,000 years). Venyukovia was herbivorous, with primitive teeth; it is thought that Venyukovia may well have been the ancestor of an important group of plant-eating therapsids, the Dicynodontia. Venyukovia and the dicynodonts did not give rise to more advanced forms, however.
