Paleohydrology, also spelled Palaeohydrology,  science concerned with hydrologic systems as they existed during previous periods of Earth history. Changing hydrologic conditions are inferred from the evidence of the alteration, deposition, and erosion in rocks from these periods. Paleohydrology also deals with the changes in the floral and faunal assemblages through geologic time that have been greatly influenced by hydrologic change.
