Endothyra,  extinct genus of Foraminifera, protozoans with a readily preservable shell; found as fossils in Devonian to Triassic marine rocks (between 416 million and about 200 million years old). Endothyra, characterized by a tightly coiled shell, is sometimes found in very large numbers; it is especially abundant in some rocks of the Mississippian Subperiod (359 million to 318 million years ago).
