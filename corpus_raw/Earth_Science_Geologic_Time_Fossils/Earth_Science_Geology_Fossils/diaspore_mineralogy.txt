Diaspore,   white or grayish, hard, glassy aluminum oxide mineral (HAlO2) that is associated with corundum in emery and is widespread in laterite, bauxite, and aluminous clays. It is abundant in Hungary, South Africa, France, Arkansas, and Missouri. Diaspore is dimorphous with boehmite (i.e., it has the same chemical composition but different crystal structure); it does not contain a hydroxyl group (OH) but has cationic hydrogen (H+) in twofold coordination with the oxygen atoms. For detailed physical properties, see oxide mineral (table).
