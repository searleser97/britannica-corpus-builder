Atmospheric electricity,  electrical phenomena that occur in the lower atmosphere, usually the troposphere—e.g., the production, transport, and loss of free electrical charges; the change in electrical potential from point to point in the atmosphere; and the atmosphere’s electrical conductivity. The term is not applied to phenomena in the ionosphere. Major fields of study within the subject are the mechanisms of charge separation in electrified clouds, especially thunderclouds; the properties of lightning strokes; global thunderstorm activity; the rate of production of ions in the troposphere by cosmic rays and background radioactivity; and the electrical properties of the atmosphere in fair and disturbed weather.
