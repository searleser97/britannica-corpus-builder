Witwatersrand System,   major division of Precambrian rocks in South Africa (the Precambrian began about 3.8 billion years ago and ended 540 million years ago). The Witwatersrand rocks overlie rocks of the Dominion Reef System, underlie those of the Ventersdorp System, and occur in an east-west band from Randfontein to Springs and from the Vaal River in the region of Klerksdorp in the north to Ventersdorp in the south. The rocks actually occupy a much larger area; much of the Witwatersrand System is covered by later deposits, and the subsurface areal extent of Witwatersrand rocks has been delimited by exploratory geophysical and drilling studies because the Witwatersrand is of great economic importance owing to its valuable deposits of gold and uranium.
In all, the Witwatersrand System consists of about 8,100 m (26,600 feet) of rocks that have been segregated into an upper and lower division, each of which is further divided into series. Three series are recognized in the lower division: the lowermost Hospital Hill Series, the Government Reef Series, and the Jeppestown Series, respectively. The upper division is divided into the lower Main-Bird Series, followed by the Kimberley-Elsburg Series. The Government Reef Series consists of alternating shales and quartzites in addition to pebbly layers that contain gold deposits; it also contains indications of a period of extensive glaciation. The most economically important series is the Main-Bird Series, largely quartzitic conglomerates that are extremely rich in uranium and gold. Large quantities of gold are also found in the Kimberley-Elsburg Series of shales, quartzites, and dolomites.
