Amygdule,   secondary deposit of minerals found in a rounded, elongated, or almond-shaped cavity in igneous rock. The cavities (vesicles) were created by the expansion of gas bubbles or steam within lava. Some amygdules consist partially of lava, which indicates their formation during solidification of the rock. Since gas bubbles tend to rise through the lava, amygdules are most common near the tops of flows. The secondary minerals may form after the solidification of the lava; the gases may help to form the filling minerals. A great variety of minerals have been found as amygdules, including some spectacular museum specimens of zeolites.
