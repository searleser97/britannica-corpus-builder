Spherulite,  spherical body generally occurring in glassy rocks, especially silica-rich rhyolites. Spherulites frequently have a radiating structure that results from an intergrowth of quartz and orthoclase. These spherical bodies are thought to have formed as a consequence of rapid mineral growth after nucleation, possibly on an accumulation of volatiles.
Spherulites that manifest concentric shells are called orbicules and are found in some granites and syenites. The shells have different mineralogies and in orbicular granite and granodiorite the bulk composition differs from that of the host rock. Orbicules are rare in gabbros. Suggested origins include devitrification of glass around scattered nuclei, inclusions of contaminating basic rock, or a rhythmic crystallization around foreign fragments.
Perlites are spherical structures that have onion-like partings in a glassy rock. Their appearance is attributed to shrinkage after solidification, though concentric weathering can produce a similar appearance. Chemical analyses of perlites indicate high water concentrations which may be related to their origin.
Varioles are pea-sized spheres intimately connected to a fine-grained groundmass but differing in colour, especially when weathered. They are typically formed by secondary minerals.
Lithophysae are hollow, bubble-like or rose-like forms that occur within certain glassy rocks. They consist of concentric shells with hollow interspaces. Many are penetrated by parallel membranes, which are continuations of laminations in the enclosing rock. The shells may be lined with delicate crystals of feldspar, quartz, or tridymite. Lithophysae may form as a result of chemical alteration of spherulites or by the expansion of gas bubbles upon extrusion.
