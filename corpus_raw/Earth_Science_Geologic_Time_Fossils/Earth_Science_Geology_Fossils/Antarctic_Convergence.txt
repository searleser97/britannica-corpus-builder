Antarctic Convergence,  transition region of the Southern Hemisphere, a major boundary zone of the worldâ€™s oceans that separates the waters surrounding Antarctica into Antarctic and sub-antarctic regions. (It is sometimes referred to as a polar front, but use of this term can cause it to be confused with the meteorological polar front, a condition of wind and atmosphere.) Within the Antarctic Convergence zone, the cold, dense surface waters of the circumpolar ocean sink and flow northward, thus creating a major meridional circulation system. This zone of convergence forms a significant biological boundary. There are many species of plants and of birds, fish, and other animals that are typical of Antarctic water and rare on the other side of the convergence.
