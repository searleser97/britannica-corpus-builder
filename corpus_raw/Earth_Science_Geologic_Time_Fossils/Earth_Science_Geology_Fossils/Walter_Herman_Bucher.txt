Walter Herman Bucher,  (born March 12, 1888, Akron, Ohio, U.S.—died  Feb. 17, 1965, Houston, Texas), U.S. geologist known for his studies of cryptovolcanic and other structural features of the Earth’s crust. He studied the primary structures of sediments and described the process of orogenic deformation (mountain building) and megatectonics (large-scale structural deformations). In 1956 he formed the theory of the origin and geographic pattern of mountain chains on the Earth’s surface.
Bucher was a member of the faculty at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, from 1913 until 1940, when he became professor of structural geology at Columbia University; he retired as professor emeritus in 1956. In 1933 he wrote The Deformation of the Earth’s Crust.
