Léon Teisserenc de Bort,  (born Nov. 5, 1855, Paris, France—died  Jan. 2, 1913, Cannes), French meteorologist who discovered the stratosphere, thus paving the way for further study of the upper atmosphere.
In 1880 Teisserenc began his career in the meteorological department of the Administrative Centre of National Meteorology in Paris. He journeyed to Africa in 1883, 1885, and 1887 to study geology and terrestrial magnetism, and in 1892 he became chief meteorologist to the centre. Four years later he resigned and set up his own private meteorological observatory at Trappes, near Versailles. One of the pioneers in the use of unmanned, instrumented balloons, he sent them up to study the characteristics of the atmosphere. He found that above an altitude of about 7 miles (11 km), the atmospheric temperature remained relatively constant at all heights. In 1900 he concluded that the atmosphere must be divided into two layers: the troposphere, where the temperature changed significantly with altitude and time and therefore induced changing weather, and the stratosphere, where the temperature remained relatively stable with increased altitude and time and which he considered a region of unchanging weather conditions.
