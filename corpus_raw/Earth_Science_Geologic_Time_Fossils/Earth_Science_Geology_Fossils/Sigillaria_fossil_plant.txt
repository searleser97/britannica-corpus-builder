Sigillaria,  extinct genus of tree-sized lycopsids from the Carboniferous Period (about 360 to 300 million years ago) that are related to modern club mosses. Sigillaria had a single or sparsely branched trunk characterized by a slender strand of wood and thick bark. Long, thin leaves grew in a spiral along the trunk but persisted only near its growing tip; on lower portions of the plant where the leaves had fallen off, characteristic polygonal leaf scars remained. Sigillaria reproduced by spores of two distinct sizes. The larger megaspores produced egg cells, whereas the smaller microspores produced sperm cells. Sigillaria appears to have preferred mineral soils of river floodplains, in contrast to its relative, Lepidodendron, which grew in peat-forming swamps. This preference for better-drained soils may have allowed Sigillaria to survive the drying of the great coal swamps that led to the extinction of many tree-sized lycopsids during the middle of the Pennsylvanian Subperiod (318 to 299 million years ago).
