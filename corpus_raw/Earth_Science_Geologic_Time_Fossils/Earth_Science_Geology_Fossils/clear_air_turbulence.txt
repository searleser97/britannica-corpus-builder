Clear-air turbulence (CAT),  erratic air currents that occur in cloudless air between altitudes of 6,000 and 15,000 metres (20,000 and 49,000 feet) and constitute a hazard to aircraft. This turbulence can be caused by small-scale (i.e., hundreds of metres and less) wind velocity gradients around the jet stream, where rapidly moving air is close to much slower air. It is most severe over mountainous areas and also occurs in the vicinity of thunderstorms.
Clear-air turbulence has not been known to cause aircraft to crash, but serious damage to airliners and many injuries to passengers have been reported. Detection for warning purposes is difficult and is usually based on pilot reports. Forward-looking infrared Doppler laser radar (called lidar) offers hope of alerting pilots to approaching clear-air turbulence.
