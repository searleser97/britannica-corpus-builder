Cacops,  extinct amphibian genus found as fossils in Early Permian, or Cisuralian, rocks in North America (the Early Permian Period, or Cisuralian Epoch, lasted from 299 million to 271 million years ago). Cacops reached a length of about 40 cm (16 inches). The skull was heavily constructed, and the otic notch, the region in the hind part of the skull that housed the hearing mechanism, was extremely large and closed behind by a bony bar. With its strongly developed legs and limb girdles, the animal was well equipped to move about on land. The tail was relatively small, and the thick plating of bony armour on the back was probably an adaptation against attack.
