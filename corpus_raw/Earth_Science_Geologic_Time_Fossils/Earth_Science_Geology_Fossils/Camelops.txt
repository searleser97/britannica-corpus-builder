Camelops,  extinct genus of large camels that existed from the Late Pliocene Epoch to the end of the Pleistocene Epoch (between 3.6 million and 11,700 years ago) in western North America from Mexico to Alaska. Camelops is unknown east of the Mississippi River.
Six species are currently recognized, but the taxonomy of this genus is in need of revision. A true camel, it resembled the slightly smaller existent Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius) in structure; it had long robust legs and a long neck and probably had a single hump because it has elongated spines only on the vertebrae over its anterior back.
Camelops became extinct in North America near the close of the Pleistocene, as did many large mammals. The cause of this large-scale extinction is unknown.
