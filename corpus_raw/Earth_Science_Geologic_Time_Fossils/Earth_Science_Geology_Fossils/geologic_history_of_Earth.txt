Geologic history of Earth,  evolution of the continents, oceans, atmosphere, and biosphere. The layers of rock at Earthâ€™s surface contain evidence of the evolutionary processes undergone by these components of the terrestrial environment during the times at which each layer was formed. By studying this rock record from the very beginning, it is thus possible to trace their development and the resultant changes through time.
