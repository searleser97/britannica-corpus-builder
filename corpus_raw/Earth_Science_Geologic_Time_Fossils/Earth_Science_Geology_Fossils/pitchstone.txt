Pitchstone,   a volcanic glass with a conchoidal fracture (like glass), a resinous lustre, and a variable composition. Its colour may be mottled, streaked, or uniform brown, red, green, gray, or black. It is formed by the rapid cooling of viscous lava or magma.
Most pitchstone occurs as dikes or marginal phases of dikes and therefore may grade into porphyry. Pitchstone porphyry (vitrophyre) consists of a glassy base (groundmass) enclosing abundant large crystals (phenocrysts) of such minerals as quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase, as well as fewer crystals of pyroxene or hornblende. Pitchstone may reveal evidence of fluid flow by the presence of wavy streaks and trains of crystals; in pitchstone dikes, the lines and layers of flowage are oriented parallel to the dike walls.
Pitchstone is a rhyolite. Pitchstone has a chemical composition, index of refraction, and specific gravity similar to those of obsidian but is distinguished by a dull, rather than vitreous, lustre. Like obsidian it is translucent on thin edges, but it is much richer in microscopic embryonic crystal growths (crystallites), the abundance of which is generally believed to account for the duller lustre. Pitchstone is richer in water than are obsidian and most other glassy rocks, generally containing 4 to 10 percent by weight; most of this water may have been absorbed from the sea or wet sediments into which the pitchstone was intruded. Some lavas and magmas appear to have congealed partly as glass and partly as crystalline material; water driven out from those portions undergoing crystallization may have been trapped or taken up by the glassy portions to form pitchstone. Pitchstone is unstable, and its conversion to a very fine-grained crystalline aggregate resembles the devitrification of obsidian. Pitchstone occurs in Colorado, U.S., and on Arran Island, off the coast of Scotland.
