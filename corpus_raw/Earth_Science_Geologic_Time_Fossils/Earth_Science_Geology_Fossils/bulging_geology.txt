Bulging,  in geology, mass movement of rock material caused by loading by natural or artificial means of soft rock strata that crop out in valley walls. Such material is squeezed out and deformed; it flows as a plastic, and the disturbance may extend down tens of metres. Folds and small faults may form at the foot of the slope where the rock material is under stress.
Valley bulging was widespread in the areas bordering glaciated regions of the Northern Hemisphere during the Pleistocene glaciations. In this case, severe ground freezing at and near the surface caused pore pressures at depth to rise sufficiently so as to cause cambering of the surface rocks and valley bulging. Valley bulging is a cause of major problems in some engineering schemes, including dam construction.
