Élie de Beaumont, in full Jean-Baptiste-Armand-Louis-Léonce Élie de Beaumont,  (born September 25, 1798, Canon, France—died September 21, 1874, Canon), geologist who prepared the great geological map of France in collaboration with the French geologist Ours Pierre Dufrénoy.
Beaumont was appointed professor of geology at the École des Mines, Paris, in 1835. He was engineer in chief of mines in France from 1833 to 1847, when he was appointed inspector general. In 1861 he became vice president of the Conseil-Général des Mines. In his work Notice sur les systèmes des montagnes (1852; “Review of Mountain Systems”), he summarized his theories on the origin of mountain ranges, attributing them to cataclysmic upheavals caused by the slow cooling and shrinking of Earth.
