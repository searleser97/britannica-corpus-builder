Proconodontid,  a small toothlike structure found in marine rocks formed over a long span of geologic time, that is among the most primitive of the conodonts. It lived during the Late Cambrian Period (the Cambrian Period began about 542 million years ago and ended about 488 million years ago). In general, the proconodontids are simpler in form and structure than the later conodonts that evolved from them.
