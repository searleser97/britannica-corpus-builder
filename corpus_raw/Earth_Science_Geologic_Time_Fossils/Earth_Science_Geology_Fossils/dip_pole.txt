Dip pole,  any point on the Earth’s surface where the dip (magnetic inclination; i.e., the angle between the Earth’s surface and the total magnetic field vector) of the Earth’s magnetic field is 90 degrees—that is, perpendicular to the surface. There are two main dip poles, one on the Antarctic coast and one in Canada’s Arctic near Bathurst Island. Dip poles may occur locally over strongly magnetic mineral deposits.
