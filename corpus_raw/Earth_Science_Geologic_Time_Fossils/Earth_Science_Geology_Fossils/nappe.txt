Nappe,   in geology, large body or sheet of rock that has been moved a distance of about 2 km (1.2 miles) or more from its original position by faulting or folding. A nappe may be the hanging wall of a low-angle thrust fault (a fracture in the rocks of the Earth’s crust caused by contraction), or it may be a large recumbent fold (i.e., an undulation in the stratified rocks of the Earth’s crust having an essentially horizontal axial plane); both processes position older rocks over younger rocks. In places, erosion may cut into the nappe so deeply that a circular or elliptical patch of the younger, underlying rock is exposed and completely surrounded by the older rock; this patch is called a fenster, or window. Fensters generally occur in topographic basins or deep, V-shaped valleys. Elsewhere, an eroded, isolated remnant of the older rock or nappe may be completely surrounded by the younger, underlying rock; this is known as a klippe, or thrust outlier. Mythen Peak in the Alps in a typical example of a klippe.
