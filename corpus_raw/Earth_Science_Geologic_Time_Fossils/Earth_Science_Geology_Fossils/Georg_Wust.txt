Georg Wüst, in full Georg Adolf Otto Wüst,  (born June 15, 1890, Posen, Ger. [now Poznán, Pol.]—died  Nov. 8, 1977, Erlangen, W.Ger.), German oceanographer who, by collecting and analyzing many systematic observations, developed the first essentially complete understanding of the physical structure and deep circulation of the Atlantic Ocean.
Wüst received his doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1919. After the death of his teacher Alfred Merz, Wüst took over as chief oceanographer on the German Atlantic (1925–27) expedition. He was also in charge of the International Gulf Stream (1938) expedition. The Atlantic expedition, conducted from the research vessel “Meteor,” was the first study of an entire ocean, and it remains one of the most extensive oceanographic surveys ever undertaken. From the wealth of data amassed, Wüst constructed cross-sectional profiles that revealed the Atlantic’s complex temperature and salinity stratification and its deep-current structure.
After World War II Wüst built up again the Institute for Oceanography, at Kiel, so that it flourished as a research centre. He was the institute’s director from 1946 until he retired in 1959.
