Seymouria,  extinct genus of terrestrial tetrapod found as fossils in Permian rocks (251 million to 299 million years old) in North America and named for fossil deposits near Seymour, Texas. Seymouria had many skeletal characteristics in common with amniotes (reptiles, mammals, and certain sets of their more primitive relatives), but it is not included in this group.
Some seymouriamorphs pursued an almost exclusively aquatic life, whereas others, such as the genus Diadectes, became early terrestrial plant-eating animals. In Seymouria, the skull was deep and much like that of early amniotes and amphibians. An opening was present in the roof of the skull for the pineal eye, a light-receptive organ found in many primitive vertebrates. Numerous teeth grew around the margins of the jaws and several in the palate; the teeth had a complexly folded internal structure, or labyrinthodont configuration, of the sort present in early tetrapods and their relatives. Seymouria was about 60 cm (24 inches) long, and the body was capable of being raised well off the ground in a stance more reptilian than amphibian. The structure of the vertebrae and limb girdles suggests a strong adaptation to terrestrial life.
