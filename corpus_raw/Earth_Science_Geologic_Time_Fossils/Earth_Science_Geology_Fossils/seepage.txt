Seepage,   in soil engineering, movement of water in soils, often a critical problem in building foundations. Seepage depends on several factors, including permeability of the soil and the pressure gradient, essentially the combination of forces acting on water through gravity and other factors. Permeability can vary over a wide range, depending on soil structure and composition, making possible the safe design of such structures as earth dams and reservoirs with negligible leakage loss, and other structures such as roadbeds and filtration beds in which rapid drainage is desirable.
