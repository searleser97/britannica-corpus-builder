Henry Melson Stommel,  (born Sept. 27, 1920, Wilmington, Del., U.S.—died  Jan. 17, 1992, Boston, Mass.), American oceanographer and meteorologist.
Stommel became internationally known during the 1950s for his theories on circulation patterns in the Atlantic Ocean. He suggested that the Earth’s rotation is responsible for the Gulf Stream along the coast of North America, and he theorized that its northward flow must be balanced by a stream of cold water moving southward beneath it. He proposed a global circulation in which surface water sinks in the far north to feed the deep, south-flowing current, while water rises in the Antarctic region to supply a northward flow along the eastern coasts of North and South America. Much of this “conveyor belt” theory has been confirmed. In addition to his work on ocean currents, Stommel did research on a variety of problems in oceanography and meteorology.
An anomaly among modern scientists, Stommel became a full professor without an earned doctorate. He received his B.S. from Yale University (1942) and served there as instructor in mathematics and astronomy (1942–44). A research associate at the Woods Hole (Mass.) Oceanographic Institution from 1944 to 1959, he became professor of oceanography at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959 and remained there except for the years 1960–63, when he taught at Harvard. Stommel established several stations to study ocean currents, including the PANULIRUS station (begun in 1954) in Bermuda. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1962 and received the National Medal of Science in 1989.
