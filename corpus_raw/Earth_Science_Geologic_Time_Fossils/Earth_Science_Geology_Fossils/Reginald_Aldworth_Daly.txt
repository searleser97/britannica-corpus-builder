Reginald Aldworth Daly,  (born May 19, 1871, Napanee, Ont., Can.—died  Sept. 19, 1957, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.), Canadian-American geologist who independently developed the theory of magmatic stoping, whereby molten magma rises through the Earth’s crust and shatters, but does not melt, the surrounding rocks. The rocks, being denser than the magma, then sink, making room for the magma to rise. This theory was instrumental in explaining the structure of many igneous rock formations.
In 1898 Daly was appointed geology instructor at Harvard University. In 1901 he became a geologist with the Canadian International Boundary Commission, and for six years he conducted surveys of the mountainous region of western Alberta and southern British Columbia. During this period, in 1903, he first proposed his theory of magmatic stoping.
After he became professor of geology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1907, his travels took him to Hawaii and Samoa. From his studies of those islands came his theory of “glacial control” of the formation of coral atolls and reefs. He found that the fluctuations of sea level during the building up and melting down of glaciers during the Pleistocene Epoch played a major role in allowing the coral to slowly build up structures more than 75 m (250 feet) high. He also proposed that submarine canyons were eroded by turbidity currents. In 1912 Daly became Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology at Harvard University, retiring in 1942.
