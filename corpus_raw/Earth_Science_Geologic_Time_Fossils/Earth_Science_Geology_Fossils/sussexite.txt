Sussexite,  white to straw-yellow borate mineral, basic manganese borate [MnBO2(OH)]. Magnesium replaces manganese in the crystal structure to form the similar mineral szaibelyite. Sussexite occurs as hydrothermal fibrous veinlets in the United States at Franklin, N.J., and Iron county, Mich. Szaibelyite occurs abundantly near Inder Lake, Kazakhstan; Rézbánya, Hung.; Suan, N. Korea; Norberg, Swed.; and in California, Utah, Nevada, and Michigan within the United States. For detailed physical properties, see borate mineral (table).
