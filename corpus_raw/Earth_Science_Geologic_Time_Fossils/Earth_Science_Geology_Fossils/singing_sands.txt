Singing sands,  sands that emit audible sounds when in motion. This phenomenon occurs in many parts of the world and has been known for many years. Sound may be produced by a footstep or by the slippage of sand downslope. The sounds emitted may vary with different sands from a roar to a musical quality, and they also vary according to the volume and velocity of the sand involved. The sand must be extremely dry in order for sound to be emitted. Singing sands are especially well sorted according to size and are highly spherical, which allows them to be very compact and to shear along thin planes. Although the exact methods and causes of sound emissions from such sands are not known, some geologists believe it is due to one layer of sand slipping over another.
