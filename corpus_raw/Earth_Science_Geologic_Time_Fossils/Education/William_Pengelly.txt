William Pengelly,  (born January 12, 1812, East Looe, Cornwall, England—died March 16, 1894, Torquay, Devon), English educator, geologist, and a founder of prehistoric archaeology whose excavations in southwestern England helped earn scientific respect for the concept that early humans coexisted with extinct animals such as the woolly rhinoceros and the mammoth.
Supervising excavations at Brixham Cave in Devon (1858–59), he found flint tools deposited with extinct-animal bones, and his continued excavation at nearby Kent’s Cavern (1865–83) demonstrated beyond any doubt that Paleolithic humans had occupied the south Devon caves.
