Greenops,  genus of trilobites (extinct arthropods) found as fossils in Middle and Upper Devonian deposits (the Devonian Period began about 416 million years ago and lasted about 56 million years). Easily recognized by its distinctive appearance, Greenops has a well-developed head and a small tail with a fringe of extended segmental rays. Long spinous processes are present at the terminal margins of the head shield and extend well back into the thoracic region.
