Lophophyllum,  extinct genus of solitary marine corals found as fossils especially characteristic of the Late Carboniferous Epoch (between 318 million and 299 million years ago) in North America. Lophophyllum, included in the horn corals (so named because of the hornlike form of the individual), probably preferred warm, clear, shallow marine waters.
