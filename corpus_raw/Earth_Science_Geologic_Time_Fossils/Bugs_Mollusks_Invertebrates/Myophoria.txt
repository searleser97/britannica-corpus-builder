Myophoria,  genus of extinct clams found as fossils in Triassic rocks. It is readily identified by its distinctive shell form and ornamentation, and thus it is a useful guide, or index, fossil for the Triassic Period (251 million to 200 million years ago). The shell in Myophoria is angular, with prominent ribs that radiate from its apex. Fine growth lines encircle the shell at right angles to the ribs.
