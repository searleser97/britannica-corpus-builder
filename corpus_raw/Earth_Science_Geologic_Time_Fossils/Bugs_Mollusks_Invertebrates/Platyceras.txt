Platyceras,  genus of extinct gastropods (snails) that occurs as fossils in rocks of Silurian to Permian age (about 444 million to 251 million years ago). Its distinctive shape is easily recognized. The caplike shell is high and broad anteriorly. The posterior portion of the shell, at the apex, is slightly coiled in an asymmetrical fashion. Frequently, the front portions of the shells are broken, though the posterior sections are relatively well preserved. Platyceras is particularly abundant in Devonian deposits (about 416 million to 359 million years old).
