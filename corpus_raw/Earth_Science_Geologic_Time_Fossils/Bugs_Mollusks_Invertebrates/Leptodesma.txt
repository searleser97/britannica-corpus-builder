Leptodesma,  extinct genus of pelecypods (clams) found as fossils in Silurian to Lower Carboniferous rocks (between about 444 million and 318 million years old). Its distinct shell, roughly oval except for a sharp outgrowth that extends posteriorly, makes Leptodesma easy to identify. A troughlike flange connects the spinous outgrowth to the main body of the shell. Concentric growth lines are also present.
