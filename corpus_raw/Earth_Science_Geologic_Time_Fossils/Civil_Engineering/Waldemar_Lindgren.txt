Waldemar Lindgren,  (born Feb. 14, 1860, Kalmar, Swed.â€”died Nov. 3, 1939, Brighton, Mass., U.S.), Swedish-born American economic geologist noted for a system of ore classification that he detailed in his book Mineral Deposits (1913).
Lindgren graduated in 1882 as a mining engineer from the Freiberg Mining Academy in Germany. Following a year of postgraduate work at Freiberg, he immigrated to the United States, where he helped build the Northern Pacific railway from St. Paul, Minn., to Portland, Ore. In 1884 he joined the U.S. Geological Survey. His extensive studies of mineral deposits in the western states enabled him to determine with unprecedented accuracy the physical and chemical conditions of ore formation. He established the igneous sources of many minerals and clarified the methods by which minerals are deposited, such as through the replacement of certain minerals by others (see metasomatic replacement).
In 1905 Lindgren helped found, and eventually contributed some 30 papers to, the journal Economic Geology. He resigned as chief geologist of the U.S. Geological Survey in 1912 to become professor of economic geology and chairman of the department of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge. Lindgren published almost 200 books and papers, and his Mineral Deposits (4th ed., 1933) was the leading advanced text in its field for many decades.
