John Fillmore Hayford,  (born May 19, 1868, Rouses Point, N.Y., U.S.—died  March 10, 1925, Evanston, Ill.), American civil engineer and early geodesist who established the theory of isostasy.
Hayford’s theory assumes that there must be a compensatory distribution of rock materials of varying density so that the Earth’s crust exerts an essentially consistent pressure that is brought to bear evenly at a certain layer in the Earth’s interior. From studies of isostasy and gravity anomalies, Hayford estimated the depth of isostatic compensation to vary from 60 to 122 km (37 to 76 miles) and from that deduced the figure of the Earth, which was adopted in 1924 as the International Ellipsoid by the International Geodetic and Geophysical Union. Hayford wrote Geodetic Astronomy (1898). He served as a member of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey periodically from 1889 until 1909, when he became director of the College of Engineering at Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill.
