Sir George Everest,  (born July 4, 1790, Gwernvale, Brecknockshire, Wales—died  Dec. 1, 1866, London, Eng.), British geodesist who completed the trigonometric survey of India, on which depended the accurate mapping of the subcontinent.
Everest distinguished himself during engineering training at military schools in England. He joined the East India Company in 1806 and served the next seven years in Bengal. During the British occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Everest worked on the survey of Java (1814–16), then returned to India. From 1818 to 1843, except for two leaves to recover his health, he worked on the survey of India, as superintendent from 1823 and as surveyor general from 1830. During his term as surveyor general, Everest introduced the most accurate surveying instruments of the day; in the course of the project, Everest and his predecessors measured the meridional arc of 11.5 degrees from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin, the southernmost point of the Indian subcontinent. Everest was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1827 and was knighted in 1861. Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak, which had been called Peak XV, was renamed in his honour in 1865.
