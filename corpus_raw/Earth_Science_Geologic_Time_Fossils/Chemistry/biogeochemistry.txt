Biogeochemistry,  the study of the behaviour of inorganic chemical elements in biological systems of geologic scope as opposed to organic geochemistry, which is the study of the organic compounds found in geologic materials and meteorites, including those of problematic biological origin. Topics that are classified within biogeochemistry and organic geochemistry include the origin of petroleum, the origin of life, composition of primitive atmospheres, biogeochemical prospecting for mineral deposits, the origin of certain ore deposits, the chemistry of natural waters, soil formation, and the chemistry of coal. Almost all geologic processes that occur at Earthâ€™s surface are affected by biological activity.
