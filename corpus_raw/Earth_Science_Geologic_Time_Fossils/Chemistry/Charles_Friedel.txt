Charles Friedel,  (born March 12, 1832, Strasbourg, Fr.—died  April 20, 1899, Montauban), French organic chemist and mineralogist who, with the American chemist James Mason Crafts, discovered in 1877 the chemical process known as the Friedel-Crafts reaction.
In 1854 Friedel entered C.A. Wurtz’s laboratory and in 1856 was appointed conservator of the mineralogical collections at the Superior National School of Mines. In 1871 he began to lecture at the École Normale and in 1876 became professor of mineralogy at the Sorbonne, but on the death of Wurtz in 1884 he exchanged that position for the chair of organic chemistry.
He collaborated in efforts to form diamonds artificially, studied the pyroelectric properties of crystals, determined crystallographic constants, and did research on ketone and aldehyde compounds. Friedel was the chief founder of Revue Générale de Chimie in 1899.
