Heat wave, also called heatwave,  period of prolonged abnormally high surface temperatures relative to those normally expected. Heat waves may span several days to several weeks and are significant causes of weather-related mortality,  affecting developed and developing countries alike. Globally, the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves observed since the 1950s has been associated with climate change. Such weather phenomena may be characterized by low humidity, which may exacerbate drought, or high humidity, which may exacerbate the health effects of heat-related stress, which include heat exhaustion, dehydration, and heatstroke.
No formal, standardized definition of a heat wave exists. The World Meteorological Organization defines it as five or more consecutive days during which the daily maximum temperature surpasses the average maximum temperature by 5 °C (9 °F) or more. Some countries have adopted their own standards. For example, the India Meteorological Department requires that temperatures increase 5–6 °C (9–10.8 °F) or more above the normal temperature, whereas the U.S. National Weather Service defines a heat wave as a spell of “abnormally and uncomfortably hot and unusually humid weather” spanning two days or more.
Oppressively hot and humid air masses lingering over populated areas can produce many deaths, especially in the middle latitudes, where many people—including the very young, the very old, and those with health problems—may be more susceptible to heat stress. Notable modern episodes include the Russian heat wave of 2010 (which covered 1,036,000 square km [400,000 square miles] and killed 55,000 people), the European heat wave of 2003 (in which more than 30,000 people died), the U.S. heat wave and drought of 1988 (which killed more than 4,000 people), and the Indian heat wave of 2015 (which killed more than 2,500 people).
