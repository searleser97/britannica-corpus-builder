Gene Shoemaker, byname of Eugene Merle Shoemaker,  (born April 28, 1928, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.—died  July 18, 1997, near Alice Springs, N.Terr., Austl.), American astrogeologist who—along with his wife, Carolyn Shoemaker, and David H. Levy—discovered the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet in 1993.
Shoemaker received a bachelor’s degree in geology from the California Institute of Technology and a doctorate from Princeton University. He worked for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) from 1948 to 1993, serving thereafter as scientist emeritus. In the 1960s he established the astrogeology branch of the USGS and subsequently its astrogeology centre at Flagstaff, Ariz. He was noted for helping to confirm the impact origin (rather than the volcanic origin) of the site now known as Meteor Crater in Arizona and for his work with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on lunar exploration missions.
Although not trained as a scientist, Shoemaker’s wife, Carolyn, also took an active interest in astronomy. Together they became a successful comet-spotting team beginning in the 1980s. By the early 1990s Carolyn had 32 comet discoveries to her credit, and Gene was credited with 29. In March 1993 the Shoemakers teamed with fellow comet hunter Levy at the Palomar Observatory in southern California to identify the fragmented comet, later named Shoemaker-Levy 9, in orbit around the planet Jupiter. In July 1994 the Shoemakers and Levy peered anxiously through telescopes to watch several major fragments of the comet pummel Jupiter, providing a spectacular show for sky watchers around the world.
Gene died three years later in a car accident while the couple was in the Australian desert studying impact craters.
