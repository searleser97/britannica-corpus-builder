Buxales,  the boxwood order of dicotyledonous flowering plants, comprising Buxaceae (90â€“120 species in five genera) and the small taxonomically contentious family Haptanthaceae (one species in one genus). Buxales belongs to a group of plants known as peripheral eudicots, together with Proteales, Ranunculales, and Trochodendrales, in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III (APG III) botanical classification system (see angiosperm).
The largest genus in Buxaceae is the widely cultivated Buxus (boxwood), with about 70 species. These are generally woody plants with small, separate male and female flowers (usually monoecious, or on the same plant). The leaves lack stipules, and the flowers have a rather inconspicuous perianth. The styles of the female flowers are unusual in being receptive (stigmatic) for their entire length, sometimes even extending down onto the ovary itself. The male flowers have the anthers opposite the perianth lobes. Sarcococca (sweet box) is the next largest genus in Buxaceae, with about 20 species native to Asia. Pachysandra has four species, three native to East Asia and one to eastern North America. The most widely cultivated species is Pachysandra terminalis, which is native to Japan and is widely cultivated as an herbaceous ground cover in most temperate regions. The genus Didymeles has only two species (D. integrifolia and D. perrieri), both of which are endemic to Madagascar.
The single species of the family Haptanthaceae, Haptanthus hazlettii, is a small tree native to Honduras; it is thought to be one of the rarest plants in the world. In 2010, after more than 20 years of unsuccessful attempts to relocate the plant based on two herbarium vouchers, the species was rediscovered on a remote hillside.
