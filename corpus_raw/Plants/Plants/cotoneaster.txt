Cotoneaster,  (genus Cotoneaster),  any of at least 50 species of shrubs or small trees of the rose family (Rosaceae) native to temperate Eurasia. Widely cultivated for their attractive growth habit, many species have been introduced into other temperate regions for use in landscaping. Cotoneasters are closely related to hawthorns and firethorns, many of which are also economically important as ornamental species.
Cotoneasters are deciduous or evergreen plants with leaves that are alternate and smooth-edged. The small white to pink flowers have five petals and sepals and are usually borne in clusters. The showy red to black fruit is a pome that measures about 8 mm (0.25 inch) in diameter and contains two to five stones.
A number of cotoneasters are important for landscape use. Low-growing species, usually less than 1 metre (3.3 feet) in height, include rockspray, or rock cotoneaster (Cotoneaster horizontalis), bearberry cotoneaster (C. dammeri), and cranberry cotoneaster (C. apiculatus); creeping cotoneaster (C. adpressus) is less than 30 cm (1 foot) tall and is a useful ground cover. Spreading cotoneaster (C. divaricatus), Peking cotoneaster (C. acutifolius), the many-flowered cotoneaster (C. multiflorus), and the common, or European, cotoneaster (C. integerrimus) are shrubs in the height range of 1–4 metres (3.3–13.1 feet). A few species in warmer climates, such as the purpleberry cotoneaster (C. affinis), Cooper’s cotoneaster (C. cooperi), and the tree cotoneaster (C. frigidus), attain heights of 4.5–6 metres (15–20 feet). Several members, including the bright bead cotoneaster (C. glaucophyllus), are invasive species.
