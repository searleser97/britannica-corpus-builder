Goosefoot,  (genus Chenopodium),  genus of several weedy salt-tolerant plants belonging to the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae), found in temperate regions around the world. Goosefoot plants are often rank-smelling, and a number of species have leaves that resemble the foot of a goose—hence their common name.
 Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa), native to the Andean region of South America, is the most economically significant goosefoot species and is grown commercially for its nutritious seeds. Lamb’s quarters, or pigweed (C. album), is a common weedy species found throughout the world. Its leaves and seeds are edible, and the plant is cultivated as a food crop in some places, particularly in India.
The taxonomy of the genus is contentious, and a number of species formerly placed in Chenopodium have been reassigned based on molecular data. Good King Henry, or mercury goosefoot (Blitum bonus-henricus, formerly C. bonus-henricus), is a deep-rooted perennial with several stems and edible spinach-like leaves. Feather geranium, or Jerusalem oak goosefoot (Dysphania botrys, formerly C. botrys), has many clusters of small flowers and is occasionally cultivated in gardens.
