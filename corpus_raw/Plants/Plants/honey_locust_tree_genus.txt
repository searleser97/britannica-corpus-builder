honey locust,  (genus Gleditsia), also called locust,  genus of 12 species of thorny trees or shrubs in the pea family (Fabaceae). Honey locusts are native to North and South America, tropical Africa, and central and eastern Asia. Some species are cultivated as ornamentals, and a number are useful for timber or as animal fodder.
Honey locusts are deciduous and bear compound leaves, often with numerous leaflets. The plants characteristically feature stout, sometimes branching thorns on the trunks and branches. The greenish unisexual flowers are typically inconspicuous and are borne in branching inflorescences (flower clusters). The legume fruits are ovate or elongated and are generally flattened; the beanlike seeds are usually surrounded by a sweet-tasting flesh.
The common honey locust, or thorny locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), of North America is a popular ornamental plant, though it is an aggressive invasive species in some areas outside its native range. In ideal conditions the tree can grow up to about 40 metres (about 130 feet) high, but its height is generally much lower under cultivation, usually about 21 metres (70 feet). Its long compound leaves are divided into as many as 30 oval leaflets, each of which is about 25 mm (about 1 inch) long. Some leaves may be doubly divided, in which case the leaflets are more numerous and smaller. The small greenish white flowers are borne in clusters in the leaf axils. The fruit is a reddish brown flattened pod, up to 45 cm (about 18 inches) long, sometimes sickle-shaped and twisted. Thornless varieties are common city trees, valued for their slender growth habit, lacy effect, and light, filtered shade.
