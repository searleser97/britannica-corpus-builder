Lady fern,  (Athyrium filix-femina),  a large, feathery fern (family Athyriaceae) widely cultivated for ornamentation. Lady ferns occur in moist semi-shaded areas in the temperate zones of the world. There are numerous cultivars, and the taxonomy is sometimes divided into three species: common lady fern (Athyrium filix-femina), narrow lady fern (A. angustum), and southern lady fern (A. asplenioides).
The deciduous leaves are about 75 cm (30 inches) long and 25 cm (10 inches) wide and grow in circular clusters. Characteristic of the genus are curved or horseshoe-shaped spore-producing clusters (sori) that are covered by a fringed membranous protective structure (indusium). The rhizomes and young leaves are considered edible after they have been cooked.
