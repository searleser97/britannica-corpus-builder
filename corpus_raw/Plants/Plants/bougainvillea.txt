Bougainvillea,  (genus Bougainvillea),  genus of about 18 species of shrubs, vines, or small trees, belonging to the four-o’clock family (Nyctaginaceae), native to South America. Many species are thorny. Only the woody vines have attained wide popularity; several species have produced very showy cultivated varieties, which are often grown indoors and in conservatories.
The inconspicuous flowers are surrounded by brightly coloured papery bracts, for which one species, B. glabra, from Brazil, is called paperflower; the bracts are purple or magenta to lighter tints in certain varieties. The stem of B. glabra may be 20 to 30 metres (about 60 to 100 feet) long in warm climates, and the plant is in flower throughout most of the year. The stem of B. spectabilis is covered with many short hairs, and the flowers are relatively short-lived. The combination of bract plus inconspicuous flower itself resembles a flower with conspicuous petals. B. peruviana, from Colombia to Peru, has rose to magenta bracts. B. × buttiana, a probable hybrid of B. glabra and B. peruviana, has given rise to varieties having lemon yellow (“Golden Glow”), orange (“Louis Wathen”), and crimson (“Mrs. Butt”) bracts. Bougainvilleas are hardy in warm climates.
