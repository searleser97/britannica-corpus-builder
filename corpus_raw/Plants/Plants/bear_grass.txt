Bear grass, also called turkey beard,  one of two species of North American plants constituting the genus Xerophyllum of the family Melanthiaceae. The western species, X. tenax, also is known as elk grass, squaw grass, and fire lily. It is a smooth, light-green mountain perennial with a stout, unbranched stem, from 0.6 to 2 metres (2 to 6 feet) high, which rises from a woody, tuber-like rootstock and cordlike roots. The stem bears a dense basal tuft of narrow, grasslike, rough-edged leaves, about one metre long; the leaves of the upper part of the stem are similar but much smaller. Flowering occurs at five to seven years. The top of the stem develops a large cluster of many small, creamy white flowers.
The turkey beard (X. asphodeloides) of southern North America is a similar plant that grows in dry pine barrens. In the southern and southwestern United States the name bear grass is given to various kinds of yucca, especially to Yucca filamentosa and Y. glauca; also to the camas (Camassia scilloides) and the aloelike Dasylirion texanum, all of which have grasslike leaves.
