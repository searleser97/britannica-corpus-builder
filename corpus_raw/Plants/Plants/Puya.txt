Puya,  genus of South American plants of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae) that contains about 200 species, including the tallest bromeliads. P. gigas (P. raimondii), native to northern South America, grows to more than 10 m (about 33 feet) tall and forms a flower stalk nearly 5.4 m tall.
Most species grow on the cool, dry, stony slopes of the Andes mountains. The stems are rather thick and woody. The stiff, spiny-edged leaves are long and narrow and grow in a dense rosette. Several species, such as P. alpestris and P. chilensis, are cultivated indoors as decorative plants. The leaves of P. chilensis are the source of a fibre sometimes used to make fishing nets.
