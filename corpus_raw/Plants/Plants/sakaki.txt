Sakaki,  low-spreading, flowering evergreen tree (Cleyera ochnacea),
 of the family Pentaphylacaceae, used in Shintō to demarcate or decorate sacred spaces. The tree, which grows in warm areas of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and mainland China, may reach a height of about 10 metres (30 feet) and in spring produces white, drooping flowers. Its branches are used in decorating Shintō shrines or sites of festivals, and even entire uprooted trees may appear in processions.
