Chickweed,  either of two species of small-leaved plants of the pink family (Caryophyllaceae). Both species of chickweed have inconspicuous but delicate, white, somewhat star-shaped flowers.
The common chickweed, or stitchwort (Stellaria media), is native to Europe but is widely naturalized. It usually grows to 45 cm (18 inches) but becomes a low-growing and spreading annual weed in mowed lawns. It can be eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable and is often added to salads. It is also useful as a food for canaries.
Mouse-ear chickweed (Cerastium fontanum), which is also from Europe, is a mat-forming, spreading perennial that has many upright stems, but it is usually not so tall as common chickweed. It grows in lawns, pastures, and cultivated fields throughout temperate regions. The stems and leaves are hairy and somewhat sticky.
