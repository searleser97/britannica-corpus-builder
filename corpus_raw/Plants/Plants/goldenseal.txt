Goldenseal, also called Orangeroot, or Yellow Puccoon,   (species Hydrastis canadensis), perennial herb native to woods of the eastern United States. Its rootstocks have medicinal properties. The plant has a single greenish white flower, the sepals of which fall as they open, followed by a cluster of small red berries. Goldenseal is sometimes planted in the shady wild garden but is also grown commercially for the yellow rootstocks, which yield hydrastine, an alkaloid.
This and a related Japanese species constitute the family Hydrastidae; some authorities list them in the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae).
