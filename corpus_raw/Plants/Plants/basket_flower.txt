Basket-flower,  (Plectocephalus americanus), also called American basket-flower or American star thistle,  annual wildflower of the aster family (Asteraceae), native to southwestern North America. It is commonly planted in gardens to attract birds and butterflies.
Resembling a spineless thistle, the basket-flower grows up to 150 cm (5 feet) tall and has stout branching stems that bear oblong leaves arranged alternately. The rose-coloured compact heads of disk flowers are surrounded by fringed bracts, similar in appearance to a woven basket. The seeds are borne in achene fruits and are wind-dispersed.
