Peyote,  (Lophophora williamsii), also called mescal button,  species of hallucinogenic cactus (family Cactaceae). Peyote is found only on limestone soils of the Chihuahuan desert of southern Texas and northern Mexico.
Averaging about eight centimetres (three inches) wide and five centimetres (two inches) tall, the body of the peyote cactus is spineless, soft, and, in most cases, blue-green to gray-green in colour. Extremely slow growing, it can take 10â€“30 years for the plant to mature before flowering. It has pink to white flowers in summer, and the fruit ripens the following year.
Peyote is well known for its hallucinogenic effects; the plant contains at least 28 alkaloids, the principal one of which is mescaline. Peyote figures prominently in the traditional religious rituals of certain North American Indian peoples as well as in the current rituals (many adapted from traditional rituals) of the Native American Church. The sale, use, or possession of dried mescal buttons or live plants is prohibited by law in many places, although a number of areas also provide exemptions for use in formal religious rites. The American Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978) is the primary legislation governing the religious uses of peyote in the United States.
The other species of the genus, false peyote (Lophophora diffusa), grows in a small area in central Mexico. Its flowers are white to yellow, and the body is yellow-green. The plant does not contain mescaline, though it is still sometimes consumed as a hallucinogen.
