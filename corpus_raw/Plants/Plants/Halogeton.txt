Halogeton,  genus of nine species of weedy plants in the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae), native to southwestern Siberia and northwestern China. Halogeton species are mostly annual plants and are known for their ability to tolerate saline soils. Several are considered invasive species in areas outside their native range.
Members of the genus have reddish stems and vary in height from a few centimetres to about 60 cm (2 feet), depending on the species. Most have bluish green cylindrical leaves with a hairlike spine at the tip. Although the succulent leaves are very high in water content, many accumulate salts and are generally avoided by herbivores. The true flowers are inconspicuous, but the very abundant seeds bear winglike bracts that resemble showy flowers.
One species, known as halogeton or saltlover (H. glomeratus), was introduced into Nevada about 1930 and is considered a noxious weed throughout much of the western United States. It is confined to salty semidesert lands, primarily in disturbed areas such as abandoned fields, abused ranges, and roadsides. The high content of oxalates makes the plant poisonous to grazing animals such as sheep and cattle, but those animals do not eat the plant in quantity when other forage is available. Elimination of the weed by spraying herbicide is feasible only in small areas.
