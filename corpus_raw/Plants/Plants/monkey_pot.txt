Monkey pot,   any shrub or tree of the genus Lecythis, of the family Lecythidaceae, particularly L. ollaria of Brazil and L. zabucajo of northeastern South America. The name is also applied to the woody fruit of these plants, so called because it is potlike in shape and suitable in size for a monkey to use.
The nuts of most Lecythis species are edible. Those of L. zabucajo, which resemble Brazil nuts, are particularly tasty. The fruit of L. ollaria contains seeds that are the source of an oil used in soaps. The wood of several species is also used in buildings, cabinetwork, tool handles, and other articles.
