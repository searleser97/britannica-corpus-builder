Coralroot,  (genus Corallorhiza), also spelled coral root,  genus of 11 species of nonphotosynthetic orchids (family Orchidaceae).  One species is Eurasian, and the others are native to North and Central America. The spotted coralroot (Corallorhiza maculata) is found throughout most of the United States and has white flowers spotted with purple.
Coralroots are nearly leafless and live primarily on dead organic matter or on the roots of other plants with the help of mycorrhizal fungi. Most do not produce any chlorophyll. Their common name refers to the coral-like shape of the reddish rhizomes (underground stems). The plants typically bear red, yellow, or white flowers on a reddish or yellow stalk.
