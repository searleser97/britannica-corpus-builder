Sun orchid,  (genus Thelymitra),  genus of about 100 species of orchids (family Orchidaceae) distributed throughout Australasia. A sun orchid derives its name from its habit of remaining closed except in strong sunlight. Some self-pollinating species never open their flowers.
Sun orchids are terrestrial perennial plants. They have a pair of ovoid tubers and typically bear a single leaf. Unlike most other orchid species, sun orchid flowers lack a central labellum (modified petal), meaning that all three petals and the sepals are similar in appearance. The flowers also have a hooded column (reproductive structure) with unusual tufted, comblike, or earlike appendages.
The lemon orchid (Thelymitra antennifera), the twisted sun orchid (T. flexuosa), the custard orchid (T. violosa), and the scented sun orchid (T. avistata) are common Australian species.
