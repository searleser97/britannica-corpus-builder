Poison oak,  either of two species of poisonous plants of the cashew family (Anacardiaceae), native to North America. Pacific, or western, poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum) is found in western North America, ranging from Baja California, Mexico, to British Columbia, Canada. Atlantic poison oak (T. pubescens) is native to the southeastern United States and is commonly confused with poison ivy (T. radicans). These species contain urushiol, and contact with the leaves and sap can cause a severe, itchy, and painful inflammation of the skin. Like many other lobe-leafed plants commonly called “oak,” neither species of poison oak is a true oak of the genus Quercus.
Pacific poison oak has a variable growth habit and can appear as a small shrub or a climbing woody vine. The compound leaves typically feature three or five lobed leaflets. The plant lives in a range of habitats, including grasslands, scrublands, and dense temperate forests.
Atlantic poison oak is a small shrub, less than 1 metre (3 feet) in height, with rhizomes. The leaves characteristically have three lobed leaflets and are usually hairy; they are variable in shape but commonly resemble those of white oak. The plant does not tolerate heavy shade and is usually found in open woodlands and sandy thickets.
