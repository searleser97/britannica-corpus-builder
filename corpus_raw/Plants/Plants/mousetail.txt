Mousetail,   any of about 15 species of small, annual, herbaceous (nonwoody) plants constituting the genus Myosurus of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). They occur in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Mousetails are so named for a long, slender column covered with pistils (female seed-bearing organs) that arises from the centre of the flower.
