Moonlight cactus,  (genus Selenicereus), also called moon cactus,  genus of about 20 species of cacti (family Cactaceae), native to tropical and subtropical America, including the West Indies. They are widely grown in suitable climates in Central and South America and have escaped from cultivation. The queen-of-the-night (Selenicereus grandiflorus) and its hybrids are often grown indoors. The plants are sometimes confused with leaf cacti of the genus Epiphyllum and are also known as night-blooming cereus, a name that is applied to numerous other cacti.
The genus is known for its large, usually fragrant, night-blooming white flowers, which are among the largest in the cactus family. The flowers often last only a single night and are usually pollinated by moths. The large fleshy fruits are spiny and red at maturity. Some species clamber along the ground; others cling with aerial roots to trees and other objects as epiphytes. The stems are ribbed, angled, or flattened and typically have short spines. S. hamatus and certain other species have backward-projecting lobes that help the plants cling to branches and other surfaces.
