Pennisetum,  genus of the grass family (Poaceae), containing about 80 species of annual and perennial plants native to tropical and subtropical areas. Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), an annual species, is cultivated in tropical areas for its edible grain. Several varieties of feathertop (P. villosum), native to Ethiopia, are cultivated as ornamentals for their arching form and feathery coloured flower clusters.
Members of the genus are typically upright with sturdy stems. The linear leaves can be narrow or wide and are sometimes rolled. Some species spread vegetatively by rhizomes (underground stems) or stolons. The flowers are borne in branching spikes and can be dense or feathery.
