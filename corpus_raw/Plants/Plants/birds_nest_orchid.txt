Bird’s-nest orchid,  (Neottia nidus-avis),  nonphotosynthetic orchid (family Orchidaceae) native to Europe and North Africa. The bird’s-nest orchid lacks chlorophyll and obtains its food from decaying organic material with the help of mycorrhizae. The short underground stem and the mass of roots that resembles a bird’s nest both store food until about the ninth year, when the plant first blooms. Its numerous pale brown flowers are borne on a leafless spike.
