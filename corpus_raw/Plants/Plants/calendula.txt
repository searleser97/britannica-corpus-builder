Calendula,  (genus Calendula),  small genus of 15â€“20 species of herbaceous plants (family Asteraceae) found in temperate regions of Eurasia and North Africa. The pot marigold (Calendula officinalis) is grown especially for ornamental purposes and is commonly found in herbal products and cosmetics. The petal-like ray flowers are edible and are sometimes used in salads.
Calendulas are annual or perennial plants with waxy, smooth, or glandular stems. The simple leaves can be somewhat toothed and are borne alternately along the stems. The leaves of some species are sessile (lacking a leaf stalk) and may have clasping leaf bases. The composite flower heads, borne singly, consist of yellow or orange ray flowers and central disk flowers that can be yellow, red, or purple in colour. The fruit is a curved achene.
