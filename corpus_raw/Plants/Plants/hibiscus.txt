Hibiscus,  (genus Hibiscus),  genus of numerous species of herbs, shrubs, and trees in the mallow family (Malvaceae) that are native to warm temperate and tropical regions. Several are cultivated as ornamentals for their showy flowers, and a number are useful as fibre plants.
The leaves are often lobed and may be smooth or covered in trichomes (plant hairs). The flowers can be borne singly or in clusters, and the flowers of many species last only a single day. An epicalyx (whorl of leaflike bracts that surrounds the sepals) is particularly common, and the stamens are typically fused into a tube. Members of the genus characteristically have spiny pollen, and their fruits are capsules.
The tropical Chinese hibiscus, or China rose (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), which may reach a height of 4.5 metres (15 feet), rarely exceeds 2 metres (6.5 feet) in cultivation. It is grown for its large somewhat bell-shaped blossoms. Cultivated varieties have red, white, yellow, or orange flowers. The East African hibiscus (H. schizopetalus), a drooping shrub with deeply lobed red petals, is often grown in hanging baskets indoors.
Other members of the genus Hibiscus include the fibre plants mahoe (H. tiliaceus), kenaf (H. cannabinus), and roselle (H. sabdariffa), rose of Sharon (H. syriacus), and many flowering plants known by the common name mallow.
