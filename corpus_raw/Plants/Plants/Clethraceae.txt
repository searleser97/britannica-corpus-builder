Clethraceae,  flowering plant family with two genera in the order Ericales. The genus Clethra has some 65 species occurring from East Asia to the southeastern United States and from Mexico southward along the Andes. A single species, the lily of the valley tree (C. arborea), grows on the Atlantic island of Madeira and is sometimes grown as an ornamental. All are woody deciduous to evergreen plants with spiral, often toothed leaves that tend to be clustered at the ends of branches. The flowers are small, fragrant, and often arranged in inflorescences at the ends of the branchlets. The genus Purdiea includes about 12 species native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America. Those species are small trees or shrubs and feature alternately arranged leaves. Purdiea flowers are considerably larger and more showy than those of Clethra.
