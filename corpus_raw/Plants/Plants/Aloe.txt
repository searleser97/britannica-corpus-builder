aloe,  (genus Aloe),  genus of more than 500 species of shrubby succulent plants in the family Asphodelaceae native to Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. Several species are cultivated as ornamentals and houseplants and for their medicinal leaves.
Most members of the genus have a rosette of leaves borne either at ground level or at the end of a stem. The leaves are usually succulent and fleshy and commonly have sharp toothed edges. Certain aloe species retain dense dead leaves around their stems to serve as insulation against the heat of wildfires. The tubular flowers range in colour from white to yellow to red. Many species are pollinated by non-hovering birds, such as sunbirds, and the flower clusters of such species are supported by tall sturdy stalks upon which the birds can land. The seeds are produced in dry capsules.
Several species are cultivated as ornamentals for their attractive architectural leaves and colourful flowers. Spiral aloe (Aloe polyphylla) is a popular specimen for its compact geometric spiral of spiny leaves. Arabian aloe (A. rubroviolacea) has long blue-green leaves with red teeth and is planted outdoors in warm climates; the leaves turn red if exposed to full sun. Snake, or mountain, aloe (A. broomii) is a common potted plant grown for its dense rosette of triangular leaves with dark teeth.
The juice of some species, especially the popular potted plant known as true aloe (Aloe vera), is used as an ingredient in cosmetics and in medicine as a purgative and as a treatment for burns. The gelatinous interior of the leaves is commonly applied directly to the skin as a beauty treatment or to soothe sunburns.
