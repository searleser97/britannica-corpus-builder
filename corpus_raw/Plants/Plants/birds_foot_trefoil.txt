bird’s-foot trefoil,  (Lotus corniculatus),  perennial herbaceous plant of the pea family (Fabaceae). Bird’s-foot trefoil is native to Europe and Asia and has been introduced to other regions. Often used as forage for cattle, it is occasionally a troublesome weed. A double-flowered form has been developed and is sometimes cultivated as a garden ornamental.
The spreading stem grows to about 60 cm (2 feet) long and bears compound leaves with three or five oval leaflets, broadest near the tip. The flowers, about 2 cm (0.8 inch) wide, are yellow, sometimes tinged with red, and grow in clusters of 5 to 10. The fruits are straight thin legumes; the clustered pods somewhat resemble bird feet and are the source of the plant’s common name.
