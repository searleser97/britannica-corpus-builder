Osage orange,  (Maclura pomifera), also called bowwood, French bois dâ€™arc,  thorny tree or shrub native to the south-central United States, the only species of its genus in the family Moraceae. The Osage orange is often trained as a hedge; when planted in rows along a boundary, it forms an effective spiny barrier. The tree also serves as a windbreak. Its hard yellow-orange wood, formerly used for bows and war clubs by the Osage and other Native American tribes, is sometimes used for railway ties and fence posts. The wood yields a yellow dye.
The Osage orange has simple oval leaves that are borne alternately along the stems. Individuals are dioecious, meaning each plant bears only male or female flowers. Female flowers are borne in a dense, nearly spherical cluster and fuse together to produce a fruit known as a multiple. The large yellow-green wrinkled fruit often grows to more than 13 cm (5 inches) in diameter and contains a milky sap that can produce dermatitis in humans.
