Citrus,  genus of plants belonging to the rue family (Rutaceae), and yielding pulpy fruits covered with fairly thick skins. Economically important plants in this group include the lemon (C. ×limon), lime (C. ×aurantiifolia), sweet orange (C. ×sinensis), sour orange (C. ×aurantium), tangerine (C. reticulata), grapefruit (C. ×paradisi), citron (C. medica), and shaddock (C. maxima).
Citrus plants are typically evergreen trees or shrubs with glossy oval-shaped leaves; many species have thorns. The flowers are usually white with five petals and are very fragrant. The fruits are a type of modified berry known as a hesperidium, and the flesh is divided into segments packed with tiny juice-filled vesicles. The peel, or rind, of the fruits is leathery and studded with oil glands.
