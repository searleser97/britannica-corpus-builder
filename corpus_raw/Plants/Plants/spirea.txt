Spirea,  (genus Spiraea),  genus of nearly 100 species of flowering shrubs in the rose family (Rosaceae). Native to the north temperate zone, many spirea species are commonly cultivated for their pleasing growth habit and attractive flower clusters.
Members of the genus Spiraea are hardy deciduous shrubs with simple leaves that usually feature toothed margins. The tiny flowers are usually clustered into dense inflorescences and have five petals and sepals and numerous (15–60) stamens. The fruit is typically an aggregate of follicles (dry fruit that opens along one side). Most species are characterized by the presence of salicylic acid in their tissues.
The most commonly grown—and possibly the most popular of all cultivated shrubs—is the Vanhoutte spirea, also called bridal wreath (Spiraea vanhouttei). The plant grows up to 2 metres (6 feet) high and produces graceful arching branches that bear numerous white flowers in spring. Other spring-flowering spireas include scalloped spirea (S. crenata), bridal wreath spirea (S. prunifolia), and three-lobed spirea, also known as Asian meadowsweet (S. trilobata). Summer-flowering species include Japanese white spirea (S. albiflora), Billiard’s spirea (Spiraea ×billiardii, derived from S. douglasii and S. salicifolia), Japanese spirea (S. japonica), willowleaf meadowsweet (S. salicifolia), and steeplebush (S. tomentosa).
Plants resembling spirea are the related false spireas (Sorbaria species) and the herbaceous false goatsbeard, or false spirea (Astilbe species), of the saxifrage family.
