Corydalis,  genus of about 300 species of herbaceous plants in the poppy family (Papaveraceae). The diversity of the genus is concentrated in the Sino-Himalayan region, though the plants can be found throughout north temperate areas and parts of eastern Africa. Many are cultivated as garden ornamentals. The root tubers of some Asian species are used in Eastern medicine to treat pain, fibromyalgia, and high blood pressure, but clinical studies are lacking.
Corydalis species are annuals or perennials. Many are weak-stemmed. The plants usually feature underground tubers or rhizomes and lobed or finely dissected leaves. The flowers are diverse in colour and form but are usually somewhat tubular and have two dissimilar pairs of petals.
Yellow corydalis, or rock fumewort (C. lutea), of southern Europe, is a popular garden perennial with 22-cm- (about 9-inch-) tall sprays of yellow tubular blooms. Native North American species include pale or pink corydalis, or Roman wormwood (C. sempervirens), a 60-cm- (24-inch-) tall annual with pink yellow-tipped flowers; and golden corydalis (C. aurea), a 15-cm (6-inch) annual.
The climbing corydalis (Ceratocapnos claviculata) of Great Britain is an annual with short sprays of cream-coloured tubular flowers. The plant was formerly placed in the genus Corydalis.
