Calabazilla,  (Cucurbita foetidissima), also called Missouri gourd, buffalo gourd, or wild pumpkin,  perennial prostrate vine of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), native to southwestern North America. Although calabazilla is a fairly unattractive plant with a fetid odour, it is sometimes grown as an ornamental in arid and semiarid areas for its colourful fruits and its edible seeds, which are rich in both oil and protein.
Calabazilla is a trailing vine with tuberous roots and triangular, long-stalked, finely toothed leaves. The yellow, unisexual flowers have five petals and are about 6 to 10 cm (2.5 to 4 inches) wide, and they produce round, inedible, predominantly green fruits with yellow stripes and markings.
