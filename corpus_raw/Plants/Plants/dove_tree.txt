Dove tree, also called handkerchief tree,  (species Davidia involucrata), small flowering tree, in the family Nyssaceae, with showy creamy bracts (modified leaves) surrounding the flowers. Native to southwestern China, it has been introduced elsewhere. Pyramidal in shape, with large bright-green leaves, it is especially impressive in bloom. Each terminal flower head is about 2 centimetres (3/4 inch) across and is subtended by two large bracts, one up to 16 cm long and the other half as long.
