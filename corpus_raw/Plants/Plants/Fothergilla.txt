Fothergilla,   genus for about five species of deciduous shrubs of the witch hazel family (Hamamelidaceae) native to the southeastern United States and sometimes planted as ornamentals for their spring flowering and their fall colour. Their flowers lack petals but produce conspicuous white to yellow puffs of stamens (pollen-producing structures) in spring. The foliage is coarse in texture. All the species are also called witch alder, but especially F. gardenii, up to 1 m (3 feet) tall. The leaves of fothergillas turn brilliant shades of orange to crimson in autumn.
