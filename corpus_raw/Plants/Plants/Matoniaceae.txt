Matoniaceae,  family of ferns dating from the Mesozoic Era (roughly 251 million to 65.5 million years ago) and distinguished by an umbrella-shaped membranous covering over clusters (sori) of spore-bearing structures (sporangia). The leaves are fan-shaped and lobed in narrow segments or have long midribs that aid the plant in a climbing habit. The family now includes only two genera (Matonia, two species; and Phanerosorus, two species). Although once widespread in the tropics, the familyâ€™s members now occur only in the Malayan region, mainly on open ridgetops at higher elevations, on mountain summits, and on limestone.
