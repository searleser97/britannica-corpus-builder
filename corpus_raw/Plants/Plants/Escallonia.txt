Escallonia,   genus of South American evergreen trees and shrubs in the family Grossulariaceae, order Rosales, comprising about 50 species. Members of the genus are found mainly in mountainous areas—notably in the Andes Mountains—although species in the temperate, southernmost portions of the range grow near the sea. Shiny-leaved Escallonia shrubs (e.g., E. langleyensis) are cultivated for their attractive, often aromatic, clusters of white, pink, or red flowers.
