Serapias,  genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae) containing about 25 species native to the Mediterranean region and the British Isles.
Serapias species are perennial terrestrial orchids and usually die back after flowering. The plants feature two oval-shaped to ovoid tubers, and the waxy sheathing leaves are usually folded or rounded at the margins. The flowers of all species have a helmetlike structure formed by the union of two sepals and one petal; most are surrounded by a large bract. The long triangular labellum (central flower lip) resembles a tongue and is sometimes hairy.
One species, S. lingua, is commonly known as the tongue orchid. It has a reddish lip, lance-shaped leaves, and a stem up to 30 cm (12 inches) long. The heart-flowered serapias (S. cordigera) has purple flowers with blackish purple lips that often have a tonguelike lobe. S. stenopetala features pale yellow flowers and is endemic to Algeria and Tunisia; the plant is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
