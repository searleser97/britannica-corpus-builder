Masdevallia,  genus of more than 500 species of tropical American orchids (family Orchidaceae). Some species are cultivated for their attractive flowers, but the plants require cool humid conditions and can be challenging to grow.
Most species are epiphytes, though some grow in soil or attached to rocks. They have short stems and erect or slightly spreading leaves that arise from a creeping rhizome. The brightly coloured flowers often have unusual shapes; the sepals are characteristically united at their bases and have one or more long tail-like extensions.
