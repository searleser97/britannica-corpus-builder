Grass tree,  (genus Xanthorrhoea),  genus of about 30 species of slow-growing perennial plants (family Asphodelaceae) endemic to Australia. Certain species are also known as grass gums because of the red or yellow gumlike resins that exude from the base of old leaves. The resins are used for varnish.
Most grass trees have thick, woody, often palmlike stems that can reach about 5 metres (16 feet) tall, though some species are low-growing. The stems may be unbranched or branching and end in a tuft of rigid grasslike leaves. The dense flower spikes extend 3 metres (9.8 feet) or more from the leaves and somewhat resemble those of the bulrush. The plants are adapted to wildfire, often having a thick layer of dead leaves to protect the stem from flames and heat. Many species can be stimulated to flower after exposure to fire.
In western Australia an unrelated monotypic species, Kingia australis, is sometimes known as grass tree.
