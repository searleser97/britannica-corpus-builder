Storksbill, also called Heronsbill,  any of several flowering plants of the genus Erodium, in the geranium family (Geraniaceae), of worldwide distribution. Many species are wild flowers useful in garden borders and rock gardens; some are used for forage; and a number of them are weedy. The common names refer to the five-parted long, bill-like capsules, which contain the seeds.
The name storksbill is also sometimes applied to Pelargonium species, the common geraniums of greenhouse and garden (see geranium).
