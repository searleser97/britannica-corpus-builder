Water hemlock,  (genus Cicuta),  genus of four species of poisonous plants in the parsley family (Apiaceae), common throughout the north temperate zone. Water hemlocks typically grow in wet, marshy places and are often confused with nonpoisonous members of the family, such as wild carrots or parsnips. The plants contain cicutoxin, which rapidly acts on the central nervous system; the roots are especially toxic, though ingestion of any part of the plants can be lethal for humans and cattle.
In Europe northern water hemlock (Cicuta virosa) is the commonly known species; it is a tall perennial herb. The best-known species in North America is the common water hemlock (C. maculata), also known as cowbane or musquash root, which grows to about 2.5 metres (8 feet) tall. It has divided leaves and clusters of white flowers.
