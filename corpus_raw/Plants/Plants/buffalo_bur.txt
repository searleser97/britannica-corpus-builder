Buffalo bur,  (Solanum rostratum), also called horned nightshade or Colorado bur,  plant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae), native to high plains east of the Rocky Mountains from North Dakota to Mexico. Buffalo bur, named for its prickly berries that were commonly entangled in the fur of American bison (Bison bison), is an aggressive weed in many parts of the United States and is an invasive species in several countries, including Russia and Australia.
Buffalo bur plants, often growing along roadsides and other disturbed areas, can reach nearly 60 cm (2 feet) tall and are covered in golden prickles. The leaves are deeply lobed, arranged alternately on the stems, and toxic to humans and livestock. The plants bear small yellow flowers in the summer and produce minute seeds that are an important food for doves and quail. Before the introduction of the potato (Solanum tuberosum) to North America, buffalo bur was the original host plant of the destructive Colorado potato beetle.
