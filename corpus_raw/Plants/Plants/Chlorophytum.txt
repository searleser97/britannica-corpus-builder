Chlorophytum,  genus of about 150 species of flowering plants in the asparagus family (Asparagaceae). The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia, and some are grown as ornamentals. The popular spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum) is a common houseplant and typically features long grassy green-and-white-striped leaves.
Members of the genus are perennial evergreen herbs, generally less than 60 cm (2 feet) tall. The roots are fleshy and tuberous, and several species spread by rhizomes (underground stems). The long narrow leaves are usually arranged basally. Small bisexual flowers are borne on a sparse flower spike, and some species produce clonal plantlets that readily root to produce new plants.
