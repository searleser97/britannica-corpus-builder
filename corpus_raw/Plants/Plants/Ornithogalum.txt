Ornithogalum,  genus of about 100 species of bulbous herbs (family Asparagaceae, formerly Hyacinthaceae) native to Eurasia and Africa. Star-of-Bethlehem (Ornithogalum umbellatum) and Arabian starflower (O. arabicum) are common garden ornamentals grown for their attractive star-shaped flowers.
The narrow or straplike leaves are grouped at the base of the plant and emerge from the underground bulb. The white or yellow bell- or star-shaped flowers are borne in clusters at the top of a leafless stalk. Each flower is borne on a short stem, with a bract (leaflike structure) below it. Some species can spread aggressively by bulbils and readily naturalize.
