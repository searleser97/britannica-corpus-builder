frangipani,  (genus Plumeria), also called plumeria,  genus of about 12 species of deciduous shrubs or small trees in the dogbane family (Apocynaceae), native to the New World tropics. Several species, especially Plumeria rubra, are widely cultivated as ornamentals in warm climates for their attractive and fragrant flowers and are easily propagated from stem cuttings. Perfumes are also derived from or imitate the odour of the flowers. The white-edged yellow flowers of the Mexican frangipani (P. rubra acutifolia) are a popular component of the Hawaiian lei.
