Anacardiaceae,  the sumac family of flowering plants (order Sapindales), with about 80 genera and about 870 species of evergreen or deciduous trees, shrubs, and woody vines. Most members of Anacardiaceae are native to tropical and subtropical areas of the world. A few species occur in temperate regions. Several species are economically important fruit and nut crops.
Members of the family have resin ducts in the bark and characteristically exude gums and resins that become black when exposed to air. The leaves are usually compound and composed of leaflets in various arrangements. Many species are dioecious, meaning that an individual only produces flowers of a single sex. The flowers are often minute. The fruits are commonly fleshy drupes.
The pistachio (Pistacia vera) and cashew (Anacardium occidentale) produce edible seeds (commonly called “nuts”), and mango (Mangifera indica), hog plum (Spondias mombin), and wild plum, or Kaffir plum (Harpephyllum caffrum), have edible fruits. The mastic tree (P. lentiscus) and the varnish tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum) contain useful oils, resins, and lacquers. The reddish brown wood of quebracho trees (genus Schinopsis, especially S. lorentzii) yields commercial tannin. The pepper tree (Schinus molle), Cotinus species, and several species of sumac (Rhus) are cultivated as ornamentals. Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac (all Toxicodendron species) are irritating to the skin.
