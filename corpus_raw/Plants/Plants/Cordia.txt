Cordia,  genus of more than 200 warm-region New and Old World trees and shrubs, of the family Boraginaceae, many valued for their decorative clusters of red-orange, yellow, or white papery blooms, for edible fruits, and for use as furniture timber. The foliage is alternate and simple, often rough surfaced.
The leaves of the tropical American geiger tree, aloewood, or sebesten plum (C. sebestena) are used as a substitute for sandpaper. The bright red-orange, six- to seven-lobed flowers are striking and occur in large clusters. The greenish, acid-tasting fruits are edible. The tree grows to 10 metres high (about 33 feet).
