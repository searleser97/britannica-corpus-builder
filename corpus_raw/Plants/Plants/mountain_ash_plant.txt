Mountain ash,  (genus Sorbus), also known as rowan,  genus of several shrubs or trees in the rose family (Rosaceae), native to the Northern Hemisphere. Unrelated to true ashes (genus Fraxinus, family Oleaceae), mountain ashes are widely cultivated as ornamentals for their flower clusters and brightly coloured fruits.
Members of the genus are small deciduous trees or shrubs and usually bear alternate pinnately compound leaves, though the leaves of some species are simple. Forming dense inflorescences, the five-petaled flowers are often white and produce small astringent pome fruits that are important for a number of fruit-eating birds. The fruit of some species can be used in jellies or alcoholic beverages.
Among the most noteworthy mountain ashes are the American mountain ash (Sorbus americana), also called dogberry, and the European mountain ash (S. aucuparia), also called rowan-berry, or quickbeam. Both are handsome trees, the European growing to 18 metres (60 feet), twice the height of the American species, and yielding several cultivated varieties popular in landscaping.
The swamp gum, or Australian mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans, family Myrtaceae), is an unrelated species native to southeastern Australia. The tree can reach heights over 114 metres (375 feet) and is the tallest angiosperm (flowering plant) species.
