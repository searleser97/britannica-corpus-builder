Yellow-flowered gourd,  (subspecies Cucurbita pepo ovifera), also called ornamental gourd or field pumpkin,  annual trailing vine of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), grown for its attractive hard-shelled fruits. The yellow-flowered gourd is native to northern Mexico and eastern North America and has long been cultivated. Some varieties produce edible squash, though the ornamental gourds are not considered edible and are chiefly used as autumnal decorations.
Both stems and leaves of the yellow-flowered gourd are covered with short bristles, and the large triangular-shaped leaves are often deeply lobed. The yellow flowers are large and showy. Both male and female flowers are borne on the same plant, but the male flowers appear about a week before the female flowers and are located toward the ends of the runners. The fruits can be naturally banded, striped, or mottled in various shades of yellow and green, though some are solid brown-white and suitable for painting. Several varieties are warty and are valued for their bizarre shapes; nest egg, pear-shaped, spoon, and ladle gourd are common names for the forms of the species. The plant requires a long growing season to mature and is sensitive to frost.
