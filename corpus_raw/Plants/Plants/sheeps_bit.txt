Sheep’s bit,   (Jasione montana), annual to biennial herb of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae), bearing clustered heads of blue flowers. The plants grow scattered in sandy or acid fields or meadows, and they also grow on cliffsides. Sheep’s bit is native to Europe and has been introduced into eastern North America.
The narrow-lobed, starry flowers of sheep’s bit mass in globes 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter in which the outside flower circles open first. The short, thick anthers are united at the base. A closely related perennial species, J. perennis, has flower heads that are 5 cm (2 inches) across and also has broader leaves. It is limited to southern Europe.
