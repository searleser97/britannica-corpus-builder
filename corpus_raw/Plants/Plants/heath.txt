Heath,  (genus Erica),  genus of about 800 species of low evergreen shrubs of the family Ericaceae. Most heath species are indigenous to South Africa, where they are especially diverse in the southwestern Cape region. Some also occur in the Mediterranean region and in northern Europe, and species have been introduced to North America. A number are cultivated as ornamentals.
The heaths have small, usually very narrow leaves arranged in whorls set closely together on the shoots. The long-lasting flowers have four sepals and a four-cleft bell-shaped or tubular corolla (ring of petals), which is inflated in many species. Most heaths are low shrubs, but some African species are large bushes or trees. Pollination of the flowers may be by wind, birds, or insects, depending on the species. Although most species have dry fruits that open to release the small seeds, a few have fleshy fruits.
The purple, or Scotch, heath, or bell heather (Erica cinerea), is common in Great Britain and western Europe. Its minute flowers yield much nectar. Other British species are cross-leaved heath, or bog heather (E. tetralix); Cornish heath (E. vagans), found also in western Europe; and fringed, or Dorset, heath (E. ciliaris), in western England and Ireland. The white, or tree, heath, or giant heather (E. arborea), found in the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa, is the source of briar root, used for making briarwood pipes. Some southern African species (e.g., E. melanthera, E. verticillata, and E. ventricosa) are cultivated in cool greenhouses and outdoors in southwestern North America; E. verticillata is considered extinct in the wild.
