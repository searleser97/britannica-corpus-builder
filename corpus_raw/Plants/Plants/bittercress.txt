Bittercress,  (genus Cardamine), also known as toothwort,  large genus of annual or perennial herbs of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), native to northern temperate areas. Bittercress plants bear white, pink, or pale purple four-petaled flowers in a terminal cluster and produce dry fruits known as siliques. Some—such as lady’s smock, or cuckoo flower (Cardamine pratensis)—are grown as ornamentals. A number of species, including narrowleaf bittercress (C. impatiens) and hairy bittercress (C. hirsuta), are considered invasive species outside their native range.
Many of the plants known as toothworts (in reference to their toothed or scaly rootstock) were formerly placed in the genus Dentaria and have been reclassified into the genus Cardamine. Toothwort, pepperwort, or crinklewort (C. diphylla) is native to moist woods of North America and bears one pair of stem leaves, each of which is divided into three broad leaflets. Cut-leaved toothwort (C. concatenata), from the same area, has a whorl of three stem leaves. Each leaf is deeply cut into three narrow, bluntly toothed segments.
