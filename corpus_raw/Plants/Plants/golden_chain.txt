Golden chain,  (Laburnum anagyriodes), also called common laburnum or golden rain,  small tree or shrub of the pea family (Fabaceae), cultivated as an ornamental. The golden chain tree is native to southern Europe. The plant is one of only two species in the genus Laburnum, the other being alpine, or Scotch, laburnum (L. alpinum); a hybrid of the two, known as Voss’s laburnum (L. ×watereri) is a common cultivar.
Golden chain grows to approximately 6 metres (20 feet) tall and often begins to branch at a point quite near the ground. The plant is deciduous, and the alternate hairy leaves are compound, bearing three leaflets. The yellow flowers, measuring about 2 cm (0.75 inch) across, are borne in drooping clusters 10–30 cm (4–12 inches) long. The fruit is a fuzzy legume about 5 cm (2 inches) long.
