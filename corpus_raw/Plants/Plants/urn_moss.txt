Urn moss,  any plant of the genus Physcomitrium (subclass Bryidae), characterized by urn-shaped or top-shaped capsules (spore cases) with lobed, hoodlike coverings. Fewer than 10 
of the 68 species are native to North America. The most common is P. pyriforme, sometimes called top moss, about 2.5 cm (1 inch) high and having a five- to eight-lobed capsule covering. The dark brown capsules have lids with short beaks and are borne on setae (stalks) less than 1 cm (0.4 inch) long. The phyllids (leaves) of both male and female plants form bright green rosettes.
