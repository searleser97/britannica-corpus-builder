Stonecress,  (genus Aethionema),  genus of about 65 species of mostly sprawling low herbs of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Most species are native to chalky, dry soil areas of the Mediterranean region, with a few species in eastern Asia. A number of stonecresses are grown as rock garden or border plants for their narrow leaves and four-petaled pink, lilac, or white flowers.
Persian stonecress (Aethionema grandiflorum) is a perennial with rosy-lavender flowers and grows to over 30 cm (1 foot). Lebanon stonecress (A. cordifolium) has rose-pink flowers on 10- to 25-cm (4- to 10-inch) plants. Fragrant Persian stonecress (A. schistosum) rarely reaches more than 30 cm in height and is cultivated for its fragrant pink flowers.
