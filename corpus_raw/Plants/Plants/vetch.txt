vetch,  (genus Vicia), also called tare,  genus of about 140 species of herbaceous plants in the pea family (Fabaceae). The fava bean (Vicia faba) is an important food crop, and several other species of vetch are cultivated as fodder and cover crops and as green manure. Like other legumes, they add nitrogen to the soil by means of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and thus are particularly valuable as a soil-enriching crop. For the low-growing ground cover Securigera varia, see crown vetch.
The plants are 30–120 cm (1–4 feet) tall, with trailing or climbing stems. The compound leaves have several pairs of leaflets and often feature a terminal tendril. The magenta, white, bluish white, or yellow flowers are borne singly or in clusters and produce legumes with 2 to 10 seeds.
