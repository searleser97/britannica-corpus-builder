Bird-of-paradise flower,  (Strelitzia reginae), also called crane flower,  ornamental plant of the family Strelitziaceae native to South Africa. The plant is grown outdoors in warm climates and as a houseplant for its attractive foliage and unusual flowers. It is named for its resemblance to the showy forest birds known as birds-of-paradise.
The bird-of-paradise flower grows from rhizomes (underground stems) to a height of 1 to 1.5 metres (about 3 to 5 feet). It has stiff, erect, leathery, concave, and oblong leaves borne on a long petiole (leafstalk). The leaves are bluish green in colour and may have a red midrib. The orange and blue flower has two erect pointed petals and five stamens. One main flower bract, shaped like a boat, is green with red borders. The fruits are capsules with numerous seeds.
Two other members of the genus Strelitzia are commonly known as bird-of-paradise flowers. White bird-of-paradise (Strelitzia alba) and giant bird-of-paradise (S. nicolai) both feature white- to cream-coloured flowers and are sometimes cultivated.
The desert bird-of-paradise, or bird-of-paradise bush (Erythrostemon gilliesii), is an unrelated shrub of the pea family (Fabaceae) native to South America and naturalized elsewhere. The dwarf poinciana (Caesalpinia pulcherrima), a showy tree grown throughout the American tropics and subtropics, is sometimes known as the Mexican bird-of-paradise or red bird-of-paradise.
