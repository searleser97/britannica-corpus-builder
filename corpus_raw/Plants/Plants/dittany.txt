Dittany,  any of several plants, including European dittany (gas plant; Dictamnus albus), American dittany (common dittany; Cunila origanoides), and dittany of Crete (Cretan dittany, or hop marjoram; Origanum dictamnus). European dittany is in the rue family (Rutaceae), while the other two species are in the mint family (Lamiaceae). All three species are bushy perennials cultivated for their aromatic foliage.
American dittany is found in dry woodlands and prairies of the eastern United States and was once used as a remedy for fever and snakebite. It attains a height of 30 cm (1 foot) and has mint-scented leaves and clusters of rose-purple to white tubular flowers.
Dittany of Crete has white, woolly, weak stems, thick leaves, and pinkish flower clusters. It is native to Greece and is used in cookery. The plant is closely related to oregano and marjoram.
