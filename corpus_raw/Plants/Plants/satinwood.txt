Satinwood,  (Chloroxylon swietenia), also called Ceylon satinwood or East Indian satinwood,  tree of the rue family (Rutaceae), native to Southeast Asia, India, and Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Satinwood is harvested for its hard yellowish brown wood, which has a satiny lustre and is used for fine cabinetwork and farming tools. Many parts of the plant are used in traditional medicine.
Satinwood is a slow-growing deciduous tree, usually reaching no more than 18 metres (59 feet) in height. The fissured bark is thick and somewhat corky, and the plant bears pinnately compound leaves. The small, creamy white or yellow flowers are borne in panicle clusters, usually before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a capsule with three segments.
Several other species in the family Rutaceae are also known as satinwoods, including Murraya paniculata, native to Asia and parts of Australia; Nematolepis squamea, endemic to Australia; and the West Indian satinwood (Zanthoxylum flavum).
