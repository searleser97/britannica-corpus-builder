Convolvulaceae,  the morning glory family of flowering plants (order Solanales), which includes some 59 genera and about 1,600 species. The family is widespread in both tropical and temperate areas, and its members are widely cultivated for their colourful funnel-shaped flowers.
Most are twining and erect herbs, with a few woody vines, trees, and shrubs. The leaves of plants belonging to the family are alternate and simple or compound, and the stems often contain latex and are rarely tuberous. The roots are usually fibrous but sometimes form rootstalks or tubers. The flower petals are united in the characteristic funnel-shaped corolla, usually with parts in multiples of five. The fruit is a berry, a nut, or a capsule.
The largest genera—Ipomoea (some 500 species), Convolvulus (100 species), and Evolvulus (100 species)—include twining vines, herbs, trees, and a few aquatics. The sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and various morning glories are economic plants of the family. Several species of bindweeds (members of Convolvulus and Calystegia) are agricultural weeds.
The seeds of two species, Turbina corymbosa and Ipomoea violacea, are sources of hallucinogenic drugs of historical interest and contemporary concern.
 The large parasitic genus Cuscuta, with about 145 species, was formerly placed in its own family, Cuscutaceae. Its members, commonly known as dodders, are now nearly cosmopolitan since their ranges were expanded by introduction with seeds of other plants. Several are considered invasive species in areas outside their native ranges.
