Sansevieria,  former genus of about 70 species of flowering plants in the asparagus family (Asparagaceae), now placed in the genus Dracaena based on phylogenetic data. The group is native primarily to tropical Africa. Many species have water-resistant leaf fibres that are sometimes used in the manufacture of ropes and for bowstrings, and several are grown as ornamentals for their attractive foliage.
Mother-in-lawâ€™s tongue, or snake plant (Dracaena  trifasciata, formerly Sansevieria trifasciata), is a popular houseplant with yellow-striped leaves and tiny pale green scented flowers. It is sometimes sold as Sansevieria.
