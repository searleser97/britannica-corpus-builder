Ylang-ylang, also spelled ilang-ilang, also called perfume tree,  (Cananga odorata), South Asian tree of the custard apple family (Annonaceae), in the order Magnoliales. A penetrating but evanescent perfume is distilled from its flowers.
Ylang-ylang in Tagalog (a Philippine language) means “flower of flowers.” The slim smooth-barked evergreen reaches about 25 m (80 feet) and is covered year-round with drooping, long-stalked, rich-scented flowers that have six narrow, greenish-yellow petals 5 cm (2 inches) long. The alternate, pointed oval leaves have wavy margins and are 13 to 20 cm (5 to 8 inches) long. The clustered oval black fruits hang from long stalks. Leis are made from the blooms, and the perfume is steam-distilled from the flowers.
Ylang-ylang vine (Artabotrys odoratissimus), also in the family Annonaceae, produces masses of small greenish white flowers in spring and clustered, long-stalked, yellow, plumlike, two-seeded fruits in fall. It is a source of commercial perfume. A 2- to 3.5-metre (about 6.5- to 11.5-foot) woody climber, it supports itself by hooks formed at the middle of the flower (and later fruit) stalks. Evergreen glossy leaves and fragrant flowers and fruits make it a valuable trellis or patio vine in areas of warm, moist climate.
