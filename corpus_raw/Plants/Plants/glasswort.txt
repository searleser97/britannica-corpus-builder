Glasswort,  (genus Salicornia), also called pickleweed,  genus of about 30 species of annual succulent herbs in the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae). Native to salt marshes and beaches around the world, glassworts are halophytic plants that accumulate salts in their leaves and stems as an adaptation to their saline habitats. The ashes of dried, burnt glassworts contain large amounts of potash and were formerly used in glassmaking. Several species, including samphire (Salicornia europaea) and umari keerai (S. brachiata), are edible and can be eaten raw or cooked.
Glasswort plants are typically small and feature jointed bright green stems that turn red or purple in the fall. The reduced leaves are minute and  scalelike, and the bisexual flowers produce small fleshy fruits with a single seed.
