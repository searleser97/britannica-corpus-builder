Bluegrass,  (genus Poa),  in botany, the largest genus in the grass family (Poaceae), comprising more than 500 species. Bluegrasses are found in temperate and tropical climates worldwide, and several have naturalized in areas outside their native range. Many species are useful as lawn, pasture, and forage grasses, and some are cultivated as ornamentals.
Bluegrasses are slender annuals or perennials. The narrow leaf blades have blunt or boatshaped tips and a membranous ligule (small appendage at the leaf base). The flowers are usually small spikelets lacking bristles and arranged in open clusters. Most species have bisexual flowers, but some are dioecious, with separate male and female plants.
Of the more than 50 species found in North America, Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) is among the best-known. It was introduced from Eurasia. It is a popular lawn and pasture grass and is common in open areas and along roadsides. It is 30 to 100 cm (12 to 40 inches) tall, with soft, blue-green leaves; its creeping rootstalks form a good sod. Canada bluegrass (P. compressa), originally native to Europe, is a wiry plant with flat stems, similar to Kentucky bluegrass in appearance and use. Texas bluegrass (P. arachnifera), mutton grass (P. fendleriana), and plains bluegrass (P. arida) are important western forage grasses. Annual bluegrass (P. annua), a small, light-green species, is a European introduction that has spread throughout North America; it is considered a pest in lawns.
