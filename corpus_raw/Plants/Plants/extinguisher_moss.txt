Extinguisher moss,  any of the plants of the genus Encalypta (subclass Bryidae), which form large tufts on limestone rocks, ledges, and walls. About 8 of the 34 species in the genus are native to North America. They are usually 1 to 3 cm (0.4 to 1.2 inches) tall, with erect capsules (spore cases) borne on setae (stalks) about 5 to 10 mm (0.2 to 0.4 inches) long. The calyptra (hoodlike covering) of each capsule resembles a candle snuffer, or extinguisher, and extends below the capsule; in E. ciliata the calyptra is fringed.
