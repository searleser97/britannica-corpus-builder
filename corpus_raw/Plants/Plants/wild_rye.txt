Wild rye,  (genus Elymus), also called lyme grass,  genus of some 50â€“100 species of perennial grasses in the family Poaceae, native to temperate and cool parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Wild ryes are named for their similarity to true rye (Secale cereale) and are generally good forage plants.
Wild rye plants are typically erect tufted grasses. The long linear leaves can be flat or rolled and are often splitting. Some species have spreading rhizomes (underground stems). The inflorescences are nodding or erect and usually feature two or more sessile flowers per node.
Virginia wild rye (Elymus virginicus) and Canada wild rye (E. canadensis) are the most widespread North American species. Bottlebrush grass (E. hystrix) is sometimes grown as an ornamental for its unusual bristled flower heads. Quackgrass (E. repens), native to Europe, is often used for erosion control.
