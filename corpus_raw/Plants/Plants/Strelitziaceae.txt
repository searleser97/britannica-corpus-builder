Strelitziaceae,  family of flowering plants in the ginger order (Zingiberales), comprising three genera and seven species in tropical to subtropical regions. Several are cultivated as ornamentals in warm climates.
The plants range in size from perennial herbs to trees. Members of the family are characterized by large flowers enclosed in bracts (leaflike structures), and both the leaves and the bracts occur in two vertical rows. Most species have large paddle-shaped leaves that are simple and entire, though the margins may fray with age. They are characteristically borne on long petioles (leaf stalks).
Ravenala madagascariensis, the ornamental traveler’s tree, is the only member of its genus. The plant is native to Madagascar and has a palmlike trunk and leaves with the appearance of a fan. The water that is stored in the leaf bases may enable it to withstand dry conditions.
Phenakospermum guyannense is also the only species of its genus. Similar in appearance to Ravenala, the plant is native to Suriname, French Guiana, and parts of the eastern Amazon River basin.
The southern African genus Strelitzia comprises five species, some of which resemble palm trees or banana plants. The bird-of-paradise flower (S. reginae), the white bird-of-paradise (S. alba), and the giant white bird-of-paradise (S. nicolai)  are cultivated to various degrees for their unusual flowers and attractive foliage.  Mountain strelitzia (S. caudata), which grows to more than 5 metres (16 feet) in height, has banana-like fruit and resembles the traveler’s tree. The rush-leaved strelitzia, or narrow-leaved bird-of-paradise, (S. juncea) has long needlelike leaves and is somewhat frost resistant.
