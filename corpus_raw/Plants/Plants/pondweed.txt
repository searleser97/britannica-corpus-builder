Pondweed,  any of numerous cosmopolitan freshwater plants sometimes grown in ponds or aquariums. They belong to two families in the order Alismatales: the Potamogetonaceae (pondweed family) and the Aponogetonaceae (Cape pondweed family), both of which have species that develop submerged or floating leaves but frequently have emergent flowering shoots.
Potamogetonaceae includes frogâ€™s lettuce (Potamogeton densus), of Europe and southern Asia, and P. crispus, of Europe but naturalized in the eastern United States and California. Cape pondweed, or water hawthorn (Aponogeton distachyos), of the family Aponogetonaceae, is native to South Africa and is grown as an ornamental in pools and greenhouses. Many species of those families serve as food for waterfowl and as cover for fishes.
