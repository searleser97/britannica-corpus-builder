Bitterroot,  (Lewisia rediviva), ornamental succulent plant of the purslane family (Portulacaceae), native to western North America and cultivated in rock gardens. The main stem and root merge into a tuberous structure. The leaves are barely 2.5 cm (1 inch) long, and the flowering stalk with pink or white flowers is also very short. The starchy root, resembling a forked radish, is edible in spring but acquires a bitter taste by summer. Other species of the genus, which has about 22 species, also are cultivated as rock-garden plants for their attractive flowers.
