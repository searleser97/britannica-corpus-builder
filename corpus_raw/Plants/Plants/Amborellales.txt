Amborellales,  plant order that contains a single member, Amborella trichopoda, in the family Amborellaceae. This order is thought to represent the earliest diverging branch among living members of the angiosperm (flowering plants) tree.
Amborella trichopoda is native to New Caledonia, in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, and has a scattered distribution through much of the central elevated part of the island. It is an evergreen shrub whose wood is considered to be of a primitive type because of its lack of vessels (a type of cell for water conduction). Male (pollen-producing) and female (ovule-producing) flowers occur on separate plants. The flowers are small, 5 mm (0.2 inch) or less in diameter, and occur in small clusters in the axils of the leaves. They have 5–8 tepals (sepals and petals are not differentiated) enclosing 10–25 stamens or 5–6 carpels. The structure of both the stamens and carpels is also considered to be relatively primitive. The stamens are flattened and leaflike. The carpels are not completely sealed, and the stigma is attached directly to the top of the ovary (there is no intermediate elongated style). The single-seeded fruits that develop from each carpel are red at maturity and only 1 cm (0.4 inch) long and 3 mm (0.1 inch) wide. Unlike most basal angiosperms, A. trichopoda apparently lacks ethereal oils.
