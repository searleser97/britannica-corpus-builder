California poppy,  (Eschscholzia californica),  plant of the poppy family (Papaveraceae), native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has become naturalized in parts of southern Europe, Asia, and Australia. Depending on conditions, California poppies flower from February to September in their native range. Horticultural varieties include tall, dwarf, double, and single; they have been developed in various colours.
California poppies are annual plants with feathery gray-green foliage. The four-petaled flowers, borne on stems 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 inches) long, are usually pale yellow, orange, or cream in the wild, but cultivated varieties are available in whites and various shades of red and pink. The ephemeral flowers open only in sunlight and produce narrow capsule fruits. The round black or brown seeds can persist in soil seed banks until growing conditions are favourable, and they sometimes emerge en masse to create “super bloom” events.
