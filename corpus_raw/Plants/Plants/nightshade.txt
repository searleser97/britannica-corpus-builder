Nightshade,  (genus Solanum),  genus of about 2,300 species of flowering plants in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). The term nightshade is often associated with poisonous species, though the genus also contains a number of economically important food crops, including tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), potato (S. tuberosum), and eggplant (S. melongena).
Nightshades are annuals or perennials and range in size from small herbs to small trees. The alternate leaves can be simple or pinnately compound and usually feature glandular or nonglandular trichomes (plant hairs). The leaves and stems are sometimes armed with prickles. The flowers have five petals that are often fused. The flowers usually are white, yellow, or purple and are borne in clusters. The fruit is a berry.
The species usually called nightshade in North America and the United Kingdom is S. dulcamara, also known as bittersweet and woody nightshade. Its foliage and egg-shaped red berries are poisonous, the active principle being solanine, which can cause convulsions and death if taken in large doses. The black nightshade (S. nigrum) is also generally considered poisonous, but its fully ripened fruit and foliage are cooked and eaten in some areas.
A number of plants outside the genus Solanum are also known as nightshades. The aptly named deadly nightshade, or belladonna (Atropa belladonna), is a tall bushy herb of the same family and the source of several alkaloid drugs. Enchanterâ€™s nightshade is a name applied to plants of the genus Circaea (family Onagraceae). Malabar nightshade, also known as Malabar spinach, refers to twining herbaceous vines of the genus Basella (family Basellaceae).
