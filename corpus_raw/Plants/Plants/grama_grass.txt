Grama grass,  (genus Bouteloua),  genus of about 50 species of annual or perennial grasses in the family Poaceae. Grama grasses are native mostly to North America, with a few species in Central and South America. The plants are important forage grasses, and several occasionally are grown as ornamentals.
Grama grasses may grow in tufts or clumps or spread by creeping horizontal stems above or below ground. Sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), blue grama (B. gracilis), black grama (B. eriopoda), and hairy grama (B. hirsuta) are some of the most important North American range species. Blue grama is sometimes cultivated for its attractive flower spikes, which can be dried for floral arrangements.
