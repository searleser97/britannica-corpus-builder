Oncidium,  genus of some 300 species of tropical and subtropical American orchids (family Orchidaceae). Oncidium species are known variously as bee orchids, tiger orchids, and dancing ladies because of their appearance. A number of them are cultivated horticulturally.
The plants vary greatly in size and shape, and most species are epiphytic. The pseudobulbs typically have several bracts and bear one to three leaves. The flowers are often yellow or brown and are commonly borne on spikes or in long sprays; they range in width from 6 mm (about 0.25 inch) to more than 10 cm (about 4 inches), depending on the species.
