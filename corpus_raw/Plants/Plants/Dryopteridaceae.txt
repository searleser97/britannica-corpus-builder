Dryopteridaceae,  the shield fern family, containing 40–50 genera and about 1,700 species, in the division Pteridophyta (the lower vascular plants). Dryopteridaceae are distributed nearly worldwide but are most diverse in temperate regions and in mountainous areas in the tropics. Most species are terrestrial or grow on rocks, although Polybotrya (about 35 species) and a few other genera have stems rooted in the ground but modified to climb up trees. Leaf morphology is extremely variable, but most commonly the sori are round and covered with a membranous protective flap of tissue (indusium). The spores are mostly bean-shaped (bilateral).
Several of the larger genera contain species that are cultivated in gardens, including Cyrtomium (as many as 20 species; holly fern), Dryopteris (250 species; shield fern, or wood fern), and Polystichum (160–200 species; also known as shield fern). The rhizomes of various species have been used medicinally and by veterinarians for their antibacterial properties and to treat parasitic worms. Dryopteridaceae species are considered relatively advanced ferns. The limits of the family are still not well understood.
Elaphoglossum (more than 700 species), which was formerly a genus in Lomariopsidaceae, contains several species that are sometimes cultivated in greenhouses for their stiff undivided leaves, which have interesting and diverse scales. At the end of the 20th century, the halberd fern genus, Tectaria, and several related genera were split into a new family, Tectariaceae, containing 8–15 genera and some 230 species.
