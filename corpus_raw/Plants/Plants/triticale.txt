Triticale,  wheat-rye hybrid that has a high yield and rich protein content. The first cross was reported in 1875 and the first fertile cross in 1888. The name triticale first appeared in scientific literature in 1935 and is attributed to Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg. In favourable environmental conditions its yield equals that of wheat; under poor conditions its yield exceeds that of wheat. Its flour is not very suitable for breadmaking but can be blended with wheat flour. Major producers of triticale are Russia, the United States, and Australia.
