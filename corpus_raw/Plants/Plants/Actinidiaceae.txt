Actinidiaceae,  flowering plant family in the order Ericales, composed of 3 genera and some 355 species. Actinidiaceae are usually shrubs, small trees, or lianas; they are largely tropical and are especially abundant in Southeast Asia. The genus Saurauia (about 300 species) grows throughout the range of the family, while Actinidia (some 30 species) is dominantly East Asian and includes the kiwi fruit (A. chinensis). The genus Clematoclethra (about 20 species) is distributed throughout central and western China. The leaves of the family are spiral and are often strongly toothed. The flowers are usually either male or female and have unfused sepals and petals. The flowers have many stamens that invert just before the flower opens, and the anthers dehisce (open) by a slit that is much broader toward the apex. The fruit is usually a berry.
