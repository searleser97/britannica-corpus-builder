Cannabaceae,  the hemp family (order Rosales), containing about 11 genera and about 170 species of plants. Its members are distributed nearly worldwide, many occurring throughout temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Older authorities included the two genera Cannabis and Humulus in the mulberry family (Moraceae), but these and the former hackberry family (Celtidaceae) are now included in Cannabaceae.
Members of the family are erect or climbing plants, including trees, lianas (woody vines), and herbaceous plants. The leaves are borne oppositely or in spirals and are often palmately lobed or compound. The plants are commonly dioecious, meaning that individuals are either male or female. The flowers are petal-less, and the dry one-seeded fruits are usually achenes or samaras.
Cannabis, with 1â€“3 species, and hops (Humulus), with 3 species, are the most economically important members of the family. The genus Celtis, commonly known as hackberries or nettle trees, contains about 70 species of trees, some of which are grown as ornamentals. The genus Trema, closely related to Celtis, comprises about 40 species of small evergreen trees. Small genera include Aphananthe, Chaetachme, Gironniera, Lozanella, Parasponia, and Pterocletis; the taxonomy of some of these groups is contentious.
