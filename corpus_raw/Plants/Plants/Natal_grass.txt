Natal grass,  (Melinis repens), also called rose Natal grass, red Natal grass, or Natal redtop,  tufted grass of the family Poaceae, native to southern Africa. Natal grass is cultivated as a forage and ornamental grass and is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range, particularly in Australia and parts of the Americas.
Natal grass typically grows as a short-lived perennial and can reach 1 metre (3.3 feet) in height. The stems are erect and sometimes hollow and bear linear leaves with reddish sheaths at the bases. The inconspicuous wind-pollinated flowers are borne in spikelike clusters known as panicles. The subsequent infructescences (clusters of fruit) are red in colour because of the glossy purple or pink hairs on the seed heads.
