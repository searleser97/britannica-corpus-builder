Dutchmanâ€™s breeches,  (Dicentra cucullaria),  herbaceous plant of the poppy family (Papaveraceae) named for its sprays of tremulous, yellow-tipped white flowers that fancifully resemble the wide-legged, traditional pantaloons worn by Dutch men. The plant is native throughout eastern and midwestern North America, usually in open woodlands. The gray-green foliage grows from white underground tubers and is not as tall as the flowering stalk; it dies back after the fruits have ripened. The leaves are trifoliate (compound with three leaflets) and finely divided. The plant grows best in shady gardens, preferably in a wind-free location.
