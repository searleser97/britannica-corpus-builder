croton,  (Codiaeum variegatum), also called variegated laurel,  colourful-leaved plant of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae) native to Malaysia and the Pacific and extensively cultivated. Numerous horticultural varieties of shrubs or small trees have been developed, and the plant is commonly grown outdoors in pots or as a houseplant. As with many members of the family, croton sap can be irritating to the skin, and the plant is considered poisonous.
Croton trees can reach a height of about 6 metres (20 feet), though varieties kept as houseplants can be significantly smaller. The plants are evergreen with brilliantly coloured, glossy, leathery leaves. Leaf colours, mostly resulting from anthocyanin in the leaf, occur solid or in combinations of green, yellow, white, orange, pink, red, crimson, and purple. The 10–15-cm (4–6-inch) leaves vary from linear and lance-shaped to oval and lobed, depending on the variety. The plants can be propagated from stem cuttings.
Another plant of the same family, but of a different genus, is purging croton (Croton tiglium), a small tree; from its seeds, poisonous croton oil is extracted. It is native to Southeast Asia.
