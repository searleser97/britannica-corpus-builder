Goatgrass,  (genus Aegilops),  genus of about 20 species of grasses (family Poaceae) native to Eurasia and North Africa. Several goatgrass species are considered to be agricultural weeds; they often grow with wheat and other cereal crops, where their eradication is difficult. Common bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) arose about 8,000 years ago, following the hybridization of Aegilops tauschii with emmer wheat (T. dicoccon); the two genera are closely related.
Goatgrasses are annual plants; some species can reach up to 80 cm (31.5 inches) in height. The linear or lance-shaped leaves are typically about 15 cm (6 inches) in length. The minute, usually self-pollinating flowers are borne in spikes and sometimes feature two or three awns (long bristles) per spikelet. Many species readily reseed themselves, and several spread vegetatively by rhizomes (underground stems).
