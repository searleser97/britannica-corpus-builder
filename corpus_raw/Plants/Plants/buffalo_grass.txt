Buffalo grass,  (Bouteloua dactyloides),  perennial western North American grass of the family Poaceae. Buffalo grass is native to short-grass and mixed-grass prairies and is an important year-round forage grass. The plant forms a dense turf and thick sod, which early settlers used in the construction of dwellings. It is sometimes planted as an ornamental or lawn grass, though its long winter dormancy makes it unattractive to some growers.
Buffalo grass is less than 20 cm (8 inches) tall, with gray-green curly leaves. It spreads extensively creeping stolons (horizontal, root-forming stems) and is drought-tolerant. The male and female flowers are borne separately, and the seeds are produced in burlike fruits.
