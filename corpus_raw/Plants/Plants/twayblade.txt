Twayblade,  any of the orchids of the genera Liparis and Neottia (family Orchidaceae). The common name derives from the characteristic pair of leaves borne at the base of the flowering stalk.
Liparis, also known as false twayblade, has about 320 species of epiphytic and terrestrial orchids distributed nearly worldwide. Each plant has broad paired leaves, and most have dull-coloured purplish flowers borne in a terminal spike. The flowers of the large twayblade (L. lilifolia), of eastern North America, have thin slender side petals and a broad lip. The fen orchid (L. loeselii) is a similar species found in northern Eurasia.
Members of the genus Neottia (including the former twayblade genus Listera) are found throughout north temperate regions. Each flower has a large forked lip. Many species have an unusual pollination mechanism by which pollinia (masses of pollen grains) are glued to a visiting insect with an explosive force. The frightened insect then leaves and transfers the pollen to the next flower it visits. Some species, such as the birdâ€™s-nest orchid (N. nidus-avis), are nonphotosynthetic and hence depend on symbiotic fungi for food. The common twayblade (N. ovata), found throughout Eurasia, has small green flowers and broad egg-shaped leaves. The lesser twayblade (N. cordata), also widespread in Eurasia, has heart-shaped leaves.
