Sea-urchin cactus,  (genus Echinopsis),  large genus of more than 100 species of cacti (family Cactaceae). Sea-urchin cacti are native to South America at medium elevations in desert shrublands or grasslands. Several species, but most especially the Easter lily cactus (Echinopsis oxygona), are valued for their ease of growth and large flowers, with tubes up to 25 cm (10 inches) long. Many ornamental hybrids have been developed, and most are hardy outdoors in Mediterranean climates.
The plants are globose to cylindrical, the largest species reaching 1.5 metres (about 5 feet) in height. The stems are strongly ribbed and have short spines. Some larger species are known as barrel cacti for their thick barrel-like shape. Flowers, often fragrant, are usually white, sometimes pink. They open after sunset and, depending upon the species, may last for up to 36 hours.
Coryphantha echinus, native to Texas and parts of Mexico, is also known as sea-urchin cactus.
