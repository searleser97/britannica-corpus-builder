Stemsucker,  (genus Pilostyles),  genus of 9–20 species of parasitic plants in the family Apodanthaceae. Stemsuckers primarily parasitize woody shrubs of the pea family (Fabaceae) and are considered endoparasites, meaning they live almost entirely within the stems of their host plants and obtain nutrition through structures known as haustoria. The plants lack photosynthetic tissues, leaves, roots, or stems, although the unisexual flowers are well developed. The genus has an unusual distribution, being found in the Americas, Western Australia, eastern Africa, and parts of the Middle East.
Thurber’s stemsucker (Pilostyles thurberi) is native to the deserts of southwestern North America and is a parasite on the stems of Dalea species and related shrubs. Its length outside the host plant is only 5 or 6 mm (almost 0.25 inch). Its presence is made visible only when its minute flowers erupt along the host’s stems.
