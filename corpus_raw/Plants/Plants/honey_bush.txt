Honey bush,   (Melianthus major), evergreen shrub, of the family Melianthaceae, native to southern Africa. Because of its sweet-scented flowers and handsome foliage, it is cultivated elsewhere, notably southern California.
The plant, which grows to about 3 metres (10 feet) tall, has fragrant, reddish-brown flowers borne in showy clusters. The fruit, a papery inflated capsule, contains black seeds.
