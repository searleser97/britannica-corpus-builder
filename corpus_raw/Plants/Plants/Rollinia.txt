Rollinia,   genus of 65 tropical American trees and shrubs belonging to the family Annonaceae (order Magnoliales). Many have edible fruits similar in flavour and appearance to those of the genus Annona. Two species (R. mucosa and R. pulchrinervis), both called biriba by some authorities, are cultivated for their fruit. Most species of Rollinia are spined or segmented, green-skinned, small trees, with soft fruits about 7.6 cm (3 inches) across. The flowers have three spurlike outside petals and three minute inner petals.
