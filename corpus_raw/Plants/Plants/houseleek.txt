Houseleek,  (genus Sempervivum), also called live-forever,   genus of about 30 species of low-growing succulent plants in the stonecrop family (Crassulaceae), native to Europe, Morocco, and western Asia. The name houseleek refers to the growth of some species on thatched roofs in Europe; live-forever indicates their hardiness and durability. They are useful in garden borders and rock gardens and are attractive in window pots indoors.
Houseleeks usually have thick fleshy leaves arranged in a dense rosette. Small plantlets, or offsets, arise in a cluster around the parent plant. Each rosette is monocarpic, meaning that the rosette dies after flowering, though the clonal offsets will persist. The white, pink, or purple flowers are borne in terminal clusters and produce ellipsoid seeds. Like other plants in the family Crassulaceae, houseleeks use a specialized system of photosynthesis known as Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM).
The common houseleek, also known as old-man-and-woman or hen-and-chicks (Sempervivum tectorum), has given rise to a number of cultivated varieties of horticultural interest. Cobweb houseleek (S. arachnoideum), with leaf tips connected by weblike strands, has also yielded many desirable varieties. Jobâ€™s beard (S. heuffelii) is a perennial with a rosette of leaves that range from gray to purple-green. Teneriffe houseleek (S. ciliosum) is noted for its attractive wooly rosettes.
