Balloon flower,  (Platycodon grandiflorus), also called Chinese bellflower,  perennial flowering plant of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae), native to East Asia. The plants are commonly cultivated as a garden ornamental and are sometimes grown as a ground cover. The balloon flower gets its name from its balloonlike flower buds.
Balloon flowers are clump-forming plants that rarely exceed 0.8 metres (2.5 feet) in height. The inflated flower buds open to form flaring bell-shaped flowers with five lobes. These lavender-blue to white flowers have a thick rubbery texture and are 5 to 7 cm (2 to 3 inches) across. Seeds are produced in a five-valved seedpod that opens at the top, and the plant features oval unstalked leaves that become narrow higher on the stems.
