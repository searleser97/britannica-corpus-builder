Disa,  genus of about 175 species of terrestrial orchids (family Orchidaceae). They grow in marshes and grasslands in southeastern Africa, in Madagascar, and on nearby islands. Red disa (Disa uniflora), a South African species, bears pink and scarlet flowers and is cultivated as an ornamental.
Most species bear flowers ranging in colour from white to purple to red and in diameter from about 0.5 to 10 cm (about 0.2 to 4 inches). The flowers are borne singularly or in racemes. The upper sepal of each flower usually has a spur and stands upright, forming a hood. Most species feature fleshy tuberous roots from which the leaves emerge annually.
