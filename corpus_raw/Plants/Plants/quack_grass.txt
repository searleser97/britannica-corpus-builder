Quack grass,  (Elymus repens), also called couch grass, or quick grass,  rapidly spreading grass of the family Poaceae. Quack grass is native to Europe and has been introduced to other north temperate areas for forage or erosion control. In cultivated lands, it is often considered a weed because of its persistence. The plant has been used in various home remedies in Europe, and the rhizomes (underground stems) have been eaten during periods of famine.
Quack grass is a perennial plant with flat, somewhat hairy leaves and erect flower spikes. The plant may grow from 30 to 100 cm (about 12 to 40 inches) high and spreads rapidly with long yellowish-white rhizomes. The plant is difficult to eradicate and must be completely dug up to prevent rhizome fragments from generating new plants.
