Curly mesquite,  (genus Hilaria),  genus of about 10 species of grasses in the family Poaceae, native primarily to warm dry areas of southern North America. All the species are important range grasses; common curly mesquite (Hilaria belangeri) and Jamesâ€™s galleta (H. jamesii) are particularly palatable to livestock when fresh and green.
Curly mesquites can be annuals or perennials and are commonly tufted. Some species have tenacious rhizomes (underground stems) or stolons and are important soil binders. The branched inflorescences bear reduced flower spikelets and produce grains with or without hairy awns, depending on the species.
