Maxillaria,  large genus of tropical American orchids (family Orchidaceae). The genus traditionally has included more than 300 species, most of which are epiphytic and grow at high altitudes; however, the taxonomy of the group is contentious. Several species are cultivated for their fragrant flowers, including the coconut orchid (Maxillaria tenuifolia), crowded maxillaria (M. densa), light fox-red maxillaria (M. rufescens), and variable maxillaria (M. variabilis).
Members of the genus come in a variety of forms. Some species are less than 5 cm (2 inches) tall, but others may grow to nearly a metre (about 3 feet). The pseudobulbs (bulblike stems) vary in position, shape, and size, depending on the species, but usually are flattened and spaced along a creeping rhizome. The leaves are thick and leathery and are usually borne singly from the top of each pseudobulb. Most species bear solitary flowers on short stalks emerging from the base of the pseudobulbs.
