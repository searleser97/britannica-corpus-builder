Mauritius hemp,  (Furcraea foetida), Portuguese piteira, French aloe,  plant of the asparagus family (Asparagaceae) and its fibre, belonging to the leaf fibre group. The fibre is made into bagging and other coarse fabrics and is sometimes mixed with other fibres to improve colour in rope. Despite its name, it is not a true hemp. The plant is grown as an ornamental in some places.
The plant has lance-shaped leaves growing directly from the short plant stalk to form a dense rosette. The gray-green leaves are 1.2 to 2.1 metres (4 to 7 feet) long and about 20 cm (8 inches) across the widest portion. Some are edged with thornlike projections. The flower stalk, which appears near the end of the plant’s life, some 8 to 10 years after planting, grows up to 12.2 metres (40 feet) and bears white flowers about 3.8 cm (1.5 inches) long. The plant is cultivated mainly on large plantations and produces leaves suitable for harvest within three to four years after planting and each 18 to 36 months thereafter. It yields about 25–30 leaves at each harvest.
Mauritius hemp is native to Brazil, where commercial production of the fibre began  about 1875. The plant was introduced to Mauritius in the late 18th century, and cultivation was established in East Africa, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and St. Helena late in the 19th century.
The fibre is usually obtained by machine decortication, a scraping process that is sometimes preceded by several days of retting. Processing is completed by washing and drying, and the fibre is sometimes brushed, which adds softness and lustre. The creamy white fibres range from about 1.2 to 2.1 metres (4 to 7 feet) long. Mauritius hemp is not as strong as the Agave leaf fibres sisal and henequen but is softer and finer. It has an affinity for dyestuffs and is fairly resistant to deterioration in fresh water but is subject to damage in salt water.
