bastard toadflax,  any of several small annual or perennial herbs of the sandalwood family (Santalaceae) that have narrow leaves resembling those of true toadflax (Linaria). In North America the name bastard toadflax refers to  Comandra umbellata, the sole member of its genus. The plant is sometimes parasitic on the roots of other plants and has creeping roots, small white flowers clustered at the top of each plant, and one-seeded fruits.
In Europe the name bastard toadflax is used for plants of the genus Thesium, particularly Thesium humifusum, which is also parasitic. The bisexual yellow or yellowish green flowers are grouped in terminal clusters, and the one-seeded fruit is dry and green.
