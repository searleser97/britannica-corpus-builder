Trillium,  (genus Trillium), also called wakerobin or birthroot,  genus of about 25 species of spring-flowering perennial herbs of the family Melanthiaceae, native to North America and Asia. Many species of Trillium are cultivated in wildflower gardens.
Trillium plants have oval bracts that resemble and function as leaves and arise from an underground rhizome. They are borne in whorls of three at the top of a stem or at ground level. The flower parts, including the sepals, petals, stamens, and stigmas, are also in groups of threes. Each solitary white, greenish white, yellow, pink, or purple flower sits directly on the bracts or is borne on a short stalk above them.
