Sugar maple,  (Acer saccharum), also called hard maple or rock maple,  large tree in the soapberry family (Sapindaceae), native to eastern North America and widely grown as an ornamental and shade tree. It is commercially important as a source of maple syrup, maple sugar, and hardwood lumber useful in furniture manufacture and flooring. The leaf of the sugar maple is the national emblem of Canada.
The sugar maple tree may grow to a height of 40 metres (130 feet). It has a dense crown of leaves, which turn various shades of gold to scarlet in fall. Its three- to five-lobed leaves appear after the greenish yellow flowers of spring. The fruits are paired samaras. Smooth grayish bark on the trunk and branches gradually furrows with age. Some trees develop special wood grain patterns such as birdâ€™s-eye maple (with dots suggesting eyes of birds) and curly and fiddleback maple, with wavy and rippled grain, respectively. Several varieties of sugar maples are available; their leaf crowns may be columnar, oval, or pyramidal in shape, with dark green to yellowish leaves.
The sweet-water sap from which maple syrup is made is different from the circulatory sap of the growing tree. When the tree is dormant, the sweet-water sap will flow from any wound in the sapwood, such as a taphole, each time a period of freezing is followed by a period of thawing. The sap contains 1.5 to 3 percent solids, mostly sucrose, but does not have the colour or flavour of maple syrup, which are imparted to the sap as it is concentrated by evaporation in open pans or boiled down. About 115 to 190 litres (30 to 50 gallons) of sap yield 4 litres (around 1 gallon) of syrup.
Several other maple species are also known as sugar maples, including the Rocky mountain sugar maple (Acer grandidentatum), chalk maple (A. leucoderme), and black maple (A. nigrum).
