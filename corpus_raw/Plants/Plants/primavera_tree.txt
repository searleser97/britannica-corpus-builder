Primavera,  (species Cybistax donnel-smithii), timber tree of Central America with brilliant yellow flowers, or its firm light wood, often called white mahogany. Although the tree is unrelated to true mahogany, the wood resembles it in being easy to work, lustrous, and free of tendency to warp. When first cut, it is a pale yellow; upon exposure to air and light it darkens to a yellowish rose with streaks of red, orange, and brown. Primavera is used, either in thin lumber or veneer form, for special effects in paneling and cabinetmaking.
