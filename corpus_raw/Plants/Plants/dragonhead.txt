Dragonhead,  (genus Dracocephalum),  genus of about 70 species of plants in the mint family (Lamiaceae). Dragonheads are native to temperate Eurasia, with the exception of one species, the American dragonhead (Dracocephalum parviflorum), which is native to North America. Several species are grown as ornamentals for their attractive flowers.
Dragonheads are generally perennial plants. They can be prostrate or erect. The stems are square and bear simple leaves arranged oppositely or in whorls. The plants are characterized by tubular two-lipped flowers, lobed at the base and the upper lip, which resemble fanciful heads of dragons. The American dragonhead produces a dense spike of blue flowers at the top of its 60-cm- (2-foot-) high stem; the flowers of other species can be purple, pink, or white.
The related false dragonheads (genus Physostegia) consist of 12 species native to North America. The best known is the obedient plant (P. virginiana), which has large pink bell-like flowers on slender spikes and is grown as an ornamental.
