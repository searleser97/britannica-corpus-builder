bladderwort,  (genus Utricularia),  genus of carnivorous plants in the family Lentibulariaceae (order Lamiales). The bladderwort genus contains 220 widely distributed species of plants characterized by small hollow sacs that actively capture and digest tiny animals such as insect larvae, aquatic worms, and water fleas. Bladderworts can be found in lakes, streams, and waterlogged soils around the world, and several are invasive species that have spread to novel habitats.
Bladderwort plants lack roots and usually have a horizontal floating stem bearing simple or divided leaves. Small carnivorous bladders are produced along the stem and can range from dark to transparent in colour. The flowers are bisexual and bilaterally symmetrical (two-lipped), with two sepals, five fused petals, two stamens, and a superior ovary (i.e., positioned above the attachment point of the other flower parts) composed of two ovule-bearing segments (carpels). Each plant produces many seeds at maturity.
The bladders, or traps, are hollow underwater structures with a flexible door or valve that is kept closed. A physiological process moves water from the interior to the exterior of the bladders, generating a state of low pressure within the traps. If a small animal triggers the bristles that project from the surface of the door, the trap suddenly opens, and a quick inflow of water sucks the prey inside. The door closes again within about 1/35 of a second, and the animal is digested. Within about 15 to 30 minutes the trap again is “set” by passing water to the exterior.
In nutrient-poor environments, carnivory affords the plants a source of organic nitrogen and phosphorus and may also provide carbon beyond that which is produced photosynthetically. Research suggests that bladderworts may form symbiotic relationships with microorganisms around the bladders, possibly to aid in the attraction and enzymatic digestion of prey.
