Heliotrope,  (genus Heliotropium),  genus of mostly herbaceous plants in the family Boraginaceae, distributed in tropical or temperate zones throughout the world. The genus has many weedy species and several that are cultivated as ornamentals. The taxonomy of the order Boraginales is contentious, and the genus Heliotropium is sometimes placed in its own family, Heliotropiaceae.
One of the best-known members of the genus is garden heliotrope (H. arborescens), a shrubby perennial up to 2 metres (over 6 feet) tall but usually smaller. It has fragrant, purple to white, flat-clustered, five-lobed flowers in coiled sprays, similar to forget-me-nots.
