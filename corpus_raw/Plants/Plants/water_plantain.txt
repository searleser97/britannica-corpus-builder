Water plantain,  (genus Alisma),  any freshwater perennial herb of the genus Alisma (family Alismataceae), commonly found in lakes, ponds, and ditches. The 9 to 11 species of water plantains are primarily distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, 3 being native to North America.
Water plantains have rhizomatous stems that support floating or emergent leaves. The leaves are generally oval or elliptic and are often heart-shaped or tapered at the base. Flowers have three green sepals (modified leaves) and three white, pinkish, or purple petals and produce achene fruits.
Alisma triviale, regarded by some authorities as a New World variety of the European species A. plantago-aquatica, is common throughout North America. The plant grows to about 1 metre (39 inches) in height and has ovate, slightly pointed leaves. The flowers grow in whorls along a many-branched stalk. Some species, including A. subcordatum and A. orientale (sometimes listed as a subspecies of A. plantago-aquatica), have been used as food and in traditional Native American and Chinese medicine.
