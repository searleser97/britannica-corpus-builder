Jequirity bean,  (Abrus precatorius), also called rosary pea, or Indian licorice,  plant of the pea family (Fabaceae), found in tropical regions. The plant is sometimes grown as an ornamental and is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range. Although highly poisonous, the hard red and black seeds are attractive and are strung into necklaces and rosaries and used in folk percussion instruments. The seeds are also used as a traditional unit of weight (ratti), equivalent to about 0.91 carat, in India.
Jequirity beans are tall twinning perennials with prickles along the stems. The plants bear compound leaves with opposite leaflets and pink or white flowers. The fruits are dry dehiscent legumes with few seeds. The seeds contain the toxin abrin and are highly poisonous; the consumption of a single chewed seed can be fatal to an adult human.
