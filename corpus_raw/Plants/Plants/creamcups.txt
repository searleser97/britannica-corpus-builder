Creamcups,  (Platystemon californicus), also spelled cream cups,  annual plant of the poppy family (Papaveraceae), native to western North America. Creamcups commonly grow with grasses in open areas and flower from March to May.
The creamcups plant is a hairy herb that reaches about 30 cm (1 foot) high. It bears 2.5-cm (1-inch) cream or pale yellow flowers singly on long stems. Six petals surround a prominent central puff of long thick stamens (male reproductive structures). The fruit is a capsule with numerous black seeds. The only member of its genus, the plant is of botanical interest for its 6â€“25 almost free (partially fused) carpels, a condition that suggests a relationship to the buttercups (family Ranunculaceae).
