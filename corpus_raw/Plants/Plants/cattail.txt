Cattail,  (genus Typha),  genus of about 30 species of tall reedy marsh plants (family Typhaceae), found mainly in temperate and cold regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The plants inhabit fresh to slightly brackish waters and are considered aquatic or semi-aquatic. Cattails are important to wildlife, and many species are also cultivated ornamentally as pond plants and for dried-flower arrangements. The long flat leaves of the common cattail (Typha latifolia) are used especially for making mats and chair seats. The starchy rhizomes are eaten in some places.
Cattails are upright perennial plants that emerge from creeping rhizomes. The long tapering leaves have smooth margins and are somewhat spongy. The tiny unisexual flowers are borne on a dense cylindrical spike, with the male flowers located above the female flowers. After releasing their pollen, the male flowers wither and fall off, leaving the characteristic brown furry fruiting spikes. When mature, the spike disintegrates to release cottony masses of minute wind-dispersed seeds.
