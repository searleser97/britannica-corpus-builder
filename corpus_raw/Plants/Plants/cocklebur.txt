Cocklebur, also called Clotbur,  weedy annual plant of the genus Xanthium of the family Asteraceae, distributed throughout much of Europe and parts of North America. Some authorities consider that the genus contains about 15 species, others say from 2 to 4.
All species have round, short clusters of male flowers, above the female flowers, which are enclosed in oval green, yellow, or brown burs that have many hooked spines and two large hornlike spines. The ripe burs adhere to the hair of animals, which widely disseminate the plant. Cocklebur (X. strumarium) is poisonous to grazing animals and was formerly used in herbal remedies.
