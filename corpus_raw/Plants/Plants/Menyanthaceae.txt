Menyanthaceae,  flowering plant family of the order Asterales, consisting of five genera and about 40 species of aquatic or marsh herbs that are native to temperate areas of the world.
Menyanthaceae species often spread vegetatively by creeping underwater rhizomes (stems) and bear floating or emergent (growing above the water surface) leaves. The leaves are usually arranged alternately along the stem and can be simple or compound with three leaflets. Flowers are bisexual, often with five petals, and produce seeds in berry or capsule fruits.
Buckbean, or bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), is the sole member of the genus Menyanthes and is native to North America. Buckbean inhabits wet soils. It has bitter-tasting leaves and is used in folk medicine. The plant bears white or pink flowers that produce hard, light brown seeds. The genus Nymphoides, known for its fringed water lily, water snowflake, and floating heart, comprises submerged plants with buried rootstalks and floating leaves. Most species bear yellow or white flowers, and many are popular aquarium plants. The genera Liparophyllum and Nephrophyllidium both contain a single species, while Villarsia is larger but not well known.
