creeping Jenny,  (Lysimachia nummularia), also called moneywort,  prostrate perennial herb of the primrose family (Primulaceae), native to Europe. The plant is grown as a ground cover in warm climates and as an indoor hanging plant. It is considered an invasive species in parts of North America and in other areas outside its native range. Creeping Jenny is sometimes called “creeping Charlie,” but that name is more commonly used for Glechoma hederacea, an unrelated ornamental of the mint family (Lamiaceae).
Creeping Jenny is a vigorous evergreen plant. The opposite, nearly round leaves are about 2 cm (0.75 inch) in diameter. The solitary yellow flowers have five petals and are borne on stalks in the axils of the leaves. The plant is most often found in moist shade.
