Cherry laurel,  either of two species of evergreen plants of the genus Prunus, in the rose family (Rosaceae). Cherry laurels are named for their similarity to the unrelated bay laurel (Laurus nobilis, of the family Lauraceae), and they are cultivated as ornamentals, particularly as hedge plants, in temperate regions. The seeds and tissues of both species contain dangerous cyanogenetic glycosides, such as amygdalin, which are capable of releasing hydrogen cyanide gas upon hydrolysis.
Prunus laurocerasus, also known as the English laurel in North America, is a small tree or shrub native to southeastern Europe and southwestern Asia. The plants barely reach heights of more than 18 metres (59 feet), and they bear simple glossy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The white five-petalled flowers form a loose cluster and have a pleasant fragrance. The fruit is a purple-black drupe with a large pit.
Prunus caroliniana, also known as the Carolina cherry laurel or laurel cherry, is endemic to the southeastern United States. A small tree, the plant grows about 5.4 metres (18 feet) tall and has glossy, rather oval or lance-shaped leaves. The small white flowers grow in an elongated cluster 5–12 cm (2–5 inches) long and produce tiny black drupes.
