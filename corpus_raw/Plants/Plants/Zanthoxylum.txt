Prickly ash,  (genus Zanthoxylum),  genus of about 200 species of aromatic trees and shrubs of the rue family (Rutaceae), native to the middle latitudes of North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Several species are cultivated as ornamentals or for their attractive wood, and some are used in herbal medicine. Sichuan pepper, a spice used in Asia, is derived from the dried husks of the fruits of various species, especially Zanthoxylum piperitum, Z. simulans, and Z. bungeanum. The unrelated angelica tree, or devil’s walkingstick (Aralia spinosa), is also sometimes known as prickly ash.
Members of the genus include both deciduous and evergreen species. The bark is often knobby and armed with thorns. The compound leaves are borne alternately along the stems and have three or more leaflets. The plants have small greenish flowers and fruits that consist of groups of two-valved capsules, each containing a single shiny black seed.
Common prickly ash, or toothache tree (Z. americanum), is very hardy, appearing as far north as Quebec. Another well-known cultivated species is Z. clava-herculis, variously called the Hercules’-club, the sea ash, or the pepperwood. West Indian satinwood, or yellowheart (Z. flavum), produces shiny golden brown timber for cabinetwork. Some species are cultivated as bonsai.
