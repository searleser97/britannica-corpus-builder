Purslane,  any of certain small, fleshy annual plants of the genus Portulaca (40â€“100 species), of the family Portulacaceae. The plants have prostrate, often reddish stems, with spoon-shaped leaves and flowers that open in the sunlight. The common purslane (P. oleracea), or pusley, is a widespread weed, recognizable by its small yellow flowers. P. oleracea sativa, known as kitchen garden pusley, is grown to some extent as a potherb, mostly in Europe. Rose moss (P. grandiflora), a trailing fleshy species, is cultivated as a garden ornamental for its brightly coloured, sometimes doubled flowers. All plants of the genus are known for their persistence; they grow well even in dry waste soil and can retain enough moisture to bloom and ripen seeds long after they have been uprooted. The capsules, which open by a lid, scatter many small seeds of great longevity.
The purslane tree (Portulacaria afra), native to South Africa, is a fleshy-leaved, soft-wooded tree up to 4 metres (13 feet) high. It is grown in California as a specimen plant for its succulent habit and its tiny pink flowers that grow in clusters; it is also cultivated widely as an indoor potted plant.
