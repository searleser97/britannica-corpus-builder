Moreton Bay pine,  (Araucaria cunninghamii), also called hoop pine or colonial pine,  large evergreen timber conifer of the family Araucariaceae. The Moreton Bay pine is native to the coastal rainforests of northern New South Wales to northern Queensland in eastern Australia and the Arfak Mountains of western New Guinea. The plant is cultivated for its wood, which is used as a veneer and for plywood and particleboard. Despite its common names, the plant is not a true pine.
The tree reaches a height of about 60 metres (200 feet) and features rough splitting bark. The branches are horizontal and bear dense tufts of branchlets near the tips. The leaves are dagger-shaped or triangular. Male and female cones are usually borne on separate individuals. The female cones take about 18 months to mature and disintegrate to release their edible seeds.
