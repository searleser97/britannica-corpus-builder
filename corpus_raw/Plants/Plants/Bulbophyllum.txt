Bulbophyllum,  one of the largest genera of orchids (family Orchidaceae), composed of more than 2,000 species of flowering plants. The genus is found in warm climates throughout Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Some species are of horticultural interest for their unusual flowers but are considered fairly difficult to grow. Several species are endangered and are threatened by habitat loss.
Bulbophyllum species have creeping rhizomes and rounded pseudobulbs (bulblike stems). Most feature a single leaf per pseudobulb, and the leaves are often succulent and usually are folded along the midrib. The genus displays a wide diversity of growth forms, ranging from small epiphytes to large canelike species. Many of these orchids have small flowers with coloured sepals that are often larger than the petals. Some species are pollinated by flies and give off an offensive odour.
