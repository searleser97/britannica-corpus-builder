Tansy,  (genus Tanacetum),  genus of about 150 species of strong-smelling herbs of the aster family (Asteraceae), native to the north temperate zone. Tansies, especially feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) and costmary (T. balsamita), are sometimes cultivated in herb gardens and are used in traditional medicines in some places. Floristsâ€™ pyrethrum (T. coccineum, sometimes Chrysanthemum coccineum) is the source of the organic insecticide pyrethrin. Common tansy, or garden tansy (T. vulgare), is sometimes known as golden-buttons and is an invasive species in many places outside its native range.
Most members of the genus are perennials, though some are annual plants. They commonly have spreading rhizomes and can be erect or prostrate in form. The flower heads of some species are button-shaped with yellow disk flowers (no ray flowers), while others have both ray and disk flowers, usually in yellow or white. The alternate, deeply cut leaves are usually borne on many stems.
