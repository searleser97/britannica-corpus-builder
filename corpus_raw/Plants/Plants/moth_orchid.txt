Moth orchid,  (genus Phalaenopsis),  genus of about 60 species of orchids (family Orchidaceae), native to southeastern Asia and part of Australia. Some species are cultivated for the commercial flower trade and are crossed to produce hybrids with beautiful white, purple, and pink flowers. Many of the horticultural species and hybrids are fairly easy to grow and are popular houseplants.
Moth orchids have a short stem that bears several broad leathery leaves. Most species are epiphytic, with thick roots, and do not require soil to survive; potted plants are commonly sold loosely rooted with wood chips. The flower spike arises from the base of the plant and has one to several long-lasting flowers. The flowers consist of two lateral petals, a central modified petal known as a labellum (lip), a column that houses the reproductive structures, and three petal-like sepals. The flowers of some species turn green after pollination. Cultivated plants require regular moisture and fertilizer and generally bloom once a year.
