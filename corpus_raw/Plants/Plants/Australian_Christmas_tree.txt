Australian Christmas tree,  (Nuytsia floribunda), also called moodjar,  parasitic tree of the mistletoe family (Loranthaceae), native to western Australia. The tree may grow to 10 metres (33 feet) or more and produces many yellow-orange flowers during the Christmas season. Its dry fruits have three broad leathery wings.
The Australian Christmas tree forms connections (haustoria) to the roots of small plants, such as grasses, through which it obtains water and nutrients. These connections may damage underground cables by forming constricting rings around them. New Christmas trees may sprout from roots at some distance from the original plant.
