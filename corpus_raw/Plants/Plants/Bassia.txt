Bassia,  genus of about 10 species of annual plants in the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae), native primarily to Eurasia. Many Bassia species can tolerate saline soil conditions and can be poisonous to grazing animals, particularly sheep. Several are considered invasive species in areas outside their native range, including the five-horn smotherweed (Bassia hyssopifolia) and hairy smotherweed (B. hirsuta), which have been introduced to the Americas.
Members of the genus are typically herbs or subshrubs and are often covered with dense hairs. The narrow leaves are sessile (lacking a petiole, or leafstalk) and are arranged alternately along the stems. The bisexual flowers are borne in terminal spikes, and many feature unusual hooked or conical appendages. The fruits are achenes with small brown seeds.
Summer cypress, sometimes called Belvedere cypress (Kochia scoparia), is a widely grown annual that was formerly placed in the genus Bassia. One variety, known as firebush or burning bush, is a globe-shaped subshrub with narrow hairy leaves that turn purplish red in autumn; it is often grown as an ornamental summer hedge.
