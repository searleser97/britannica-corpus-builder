Snake gourd,  (Trichosanthes cucumerina), also called serpent gourd,  rapid-growing vine of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), cultivated for its oddly shaped edible fruits. The snake gourd is native to southeastern Asia and Australia and is also grown in parts of tropical Africa. The whole fruit is eaten as a vegetable when young and can be dried and used as a soap. The leaves and shoots are also edible, and the pulp of mature fruits is sometimes eaten as a tomato substitute.
The snake gourd is an annual plant with forked tendrils and kidney- or heart-shaped leaves that are sometimes palmately lobed. The white unisexual flowers have long lacy fringes on the five petals and open at night. The narrow fruits often reach 1.5 metres (5 feet) in length; they are green with white stripes when young, becoming a red-orange colour when mature.
