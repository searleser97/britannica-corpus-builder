Ageratum,  (genus Ageratum), also called whiteweed,  any of about 40 species of herbs in the genus Ageratum (family Asteraceae). Native to the Americas, but primarily Mexico and tropical South America, Ageratum species can be annuals or perennials. They have toothed ovate leaves arranged oppositely along the stem. Similar to most members of Asteraceae, they feature composite flower heads composed of blue, pink, lilac, or white discoid flowers. These flowers produce small dry fruits with minute seeds.
The common garden ageratum (A. houstonianum), also known as floss flower and blue mink, is frequently cultivated as an ornamental annual. Several dwarf varieties are commonly used as edging plants.
