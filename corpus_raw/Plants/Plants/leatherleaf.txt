Leatherleaf, also called cassandra,  (Chamaedaphne calyculata), evergreen shrub of the heath family (Ericaceae). The name is also sometimes applied to a stiff-leaved fern.
C. calyculata occurs in Arctic regions and in North America as far south as Georgia. It forms large beds at the edges of swamps and boggy meadows. The plant grows to about 1.2 metres (4 feet) in height. The brownish, alternate leaves, 1–5 cm (about 0.5–2 inches) long, are oblong or lance-shaped and are covered by scales—hence the colour. The flowers, which often appear while snow is still on the ground, are small, white, and bell-shaped. They are borne along arching, leafy shoots. The fruit is a small, dry capsule.
