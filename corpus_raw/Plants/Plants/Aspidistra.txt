Aspidistra,  genus of ornamental foliage plants in the family Ruscaceae, native to eastern Asia. The only cultivated species is a houseplant commonly known as cast-iron plant (A. elatior, or A. lurida). The cast-iron plant has long, stiff, pointed evergreen leaves that are capable of withstanding temperature extremes, dust, smoke, and other harsh conditions. The solitary, bell-shaped flowers, which are usually lilac in colour but sometimes brown or green, are borne at the base of the plant. The fruits of Aspidistra are small berries.
