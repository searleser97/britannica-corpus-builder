Clusiaceae,  the garcinia family (order Malpighiales), comprising about 14 genera and some 800 species of tropical trees and shrubs. Several are important for their fruits, resins, or timbers, and a number of species are cultivated as ornamentals.
Members of the Clusiaceae family usually have broad-ended oblong leaves; these may be leathery and have a strong central vein from which branch many delicate horizontal veins. The plants have resinous sticky sap, flowers with numerous stamens often united in bundles, and separate petals and sepals. Male and female organs often occur in separate flowers.
The genus Clusia has some 300â€“400 species native to tropical America. Many members begin as epiphytes in the tree canopy and eventually send roots over the host tree to the ground. Scotch attorney, or cupey (C. rosea), which is native to the Caribbean area, grows to about 10 metres (30 feet) and is often planted as a beach shrub in areas exposed to salt spray. It has leaves 10 cm (4 inches) long, flatly open flowers with six rosy white waxy petals, and many-seeded, multicelled, golfball-sized fruits. Like other species in the family, the fruits open and the valves spread widely like a star, exposing the succulent bright orange tissue (arils) surrounding the seeds.
Several trees of the genus Garcinia produce valuable fruits, such as the mangosteen (G. mangostana). Waika plum, or lemon drop mangosteen (G. intermedia), native to Central America, has a small, oval, yellow fruit. There are about 250 species in the tropics, especially common in Indo-Malesia.
Other major genera include Tovomita (60 species) and Chrysochlamys (55 species), native to the New World tropics, and Symphonia (23 species), found in tropical areas around the world.
