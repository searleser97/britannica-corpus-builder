Tickseed,  any ornamental summer-blooming plant of the genus Coreopsis of the family Asteraceae, consisting of about 115 species of annual and perennial herbs native to North America. Members of the genus have flower heads with yellow disk flowers and yellow, pink, white, or variegated ray flowers. The heads are solitary or in branched clusters, and some varieties have double flowers.
Tickseed leaves often are lobed and usually are opposite each other on the stem. Golden coreopsis (C. tinctoria) is a popular garden plant, and swamp tickseed (C. rosea) is grown in wildflower gardens.
