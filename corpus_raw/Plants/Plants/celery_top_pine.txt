Celery-top pine,  (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius), also called adventure bay pine,  slow-growing ornamental and timber conifer (family Podocarpaceae), native to temperate rainforests of Tasmania at elevations from sea level to 750 metres (2,500 feet). The dense golden-brown wood is used in fine furniture.
The tree is shrubby at high elevations but may grow to 18 metres (60 feet) and occasionally 30 metres (100 feet) in lower areas. The irregularly arranged branches bear inconspicuous scale-like leaves; leaf functions are performed mainly by deciduous leathery phylloclades (flattened leaf-like branches) that resemble celery leaflets.
