American yew, also called Canada yew, dwarf yew, ground hemlock, or creeping hemlock,  (Taxus canadensis), a prostrate, straggling evergreen shrub of the family Taxaceae, found in northeastern North America. American yew also is a lumber trade name for the Pacific yew. The American yew, the hardiest of the yew species, provides excellent ground cover in forested areas. Usually growing about 1 metre (3 feet) high, it has small yellowish green leaves that taper abruptly to a tiny point.
