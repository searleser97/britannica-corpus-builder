Pistacia,  genus of nine species of aromatic trees and shrubs in the cashew family (Anacardiaceae). Most species are native to Eurasia, with one species in southwestern North America and another in the Canary Islands. The genus includes the economically important pistachio (Pistacia vera) as well as several ornamental and medicinal species.
Members of the genus can be deciduous or evergreen and commonly feature compound leaves that are alternately arranged along the stems. The plants are dioecious, meaning that individuals are male or female, and the flowers are typically small with five petals. The fruit is an asymmetrical drupe. The plants grow well in warm semiarid regions, and many can tolerate poor soils.
The Chinese pistachio (P. chinensis) is a tall ornamental tree with scarlet fruits and colourful autumn foliage. The mastic tree (P. lentiscus) and the turpentine tree, or terebinth (P. terebinthus), produce sweet-smelling gums used in medicine. Mastic also is used in liqueurs and varnishes. Commercial pistachio nuts  are extensively used as food and for yellowish green colouring in confections.
