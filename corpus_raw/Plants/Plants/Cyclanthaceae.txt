Cyclanthaceae,  the Panama hat palm order of monocotyledonous flowering plants, which has 11 genera of mostly stemless, perennial, palmlike herbs, woody herbaceous shrubs, and climbing vines that are distributed in Central America and tropical South America.
The plants are characterized by parallel-veined, sometimes fan-shaped, often deeply forked and lobed leaves and small, separately sexed flowers that are densely crowded along the axis of a rodlike structure called a spadix. Each spadix is surrounded by several conspicuous sheathing spathes (leaflike or petallike structures) that usually fall as the flowers mature. The flowers are characteristically arranged either in spiraling groups of one female surrounded by four male flowers or in alternating whorls of male and female flowers.
The chief genera are Asplundia (82 species), Dicranopygium (44 species), Sphaeradenia (38 species), Carludovica (3 species), and Cyclanthus (one species). Cyclanthus differs from the other genera in having a screwlike spadix structure.
In Ecuador and perhaps elsewhere in Latin America, the young leaves of Carludovica palmata are collected, cut into narrow strips, and bleached, to be woven into Panama hats.
