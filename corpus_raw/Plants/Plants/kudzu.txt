Kudzu,  (Pueraria montana),  twining perennial vine of the pea family (Fabaceae). Kudzu is native to China and Japan, where it has long been grown for its edible starchy roots and for a fibre made from its stems. Kudzu is a useful fodder crop for livestock as well as an attractive ornamental. However, it is an aggressive invasive species in some areas outside its native range.
Kudzu is a fast-growing, woody, somewhat hairy vine that may grow to a length of 18 metres (60 feet) in one season and features a substantial taproot. It has large compound leaves with three broad leaflets with hairy margins. The plant bears long racemes of late-blooming reddish purple flowers and flat hairy seed pods. The plant spreads vegetatively with stolons and rhizomes that root to form new clonal plants.
Kudzu was initially taken to North America in the late 1800s as an ornamental, and farmers were encouraged to plant it to anchor steep banks of soil and thereby prevent erosion. Sometimes referred to as “the vine that ate the South,” the plant has become a rampant invasive species in parts of the southeastern United States and readily spreads over trees and shrubs, often killing them. Northern winters tend to kill the plant’s stems but allow the roots to survive. Control methods include herbicide sprays, manual cutting and mowing, and the use of goats and sheep.
