Spicebush,  (Lindera benzoin), deciduous, dense shrub of the laurel family (Lauraceae), native to eastern North America. It occurs most often in damp woods and grows about 1.5–6 m (about 5–20 feet) tall. The alternate leaves are rather oblong, but wedge-shaped near the base, and 8–13 cm (3–5 inches) long. The small, yellow, unisexual flowers are crowded in small, nearly stalkless clusters. The seed of the fleshy red fruit has a stony covering. Young twigs, leaves, and fruit are sometimes used to make a tealike beverage.
