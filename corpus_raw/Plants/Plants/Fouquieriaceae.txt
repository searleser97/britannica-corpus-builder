Fouquieriaceae,  the ocotillo family of the order Ericales, composed of 11 species in the genus Fouquieria. Native to the deserts of western North America, Fouquieria species are often small-branched shrubs or trees with spirally arranged leaves that are drought-deciduous (i.e., the leaves are dropped during the dry season). Leaves on some plants are borne close together, while those on others are well separated and often have the petioles (leaf stems) modified as spines after the rest of the leaf has fallen. The flowers are often red or orange and have strongly fused petals with 10 or more stamens. Most species are pollinated by hummingbirds or bats, and the seeds are wind-dispersed. See also ocotillo; boojum tree.
