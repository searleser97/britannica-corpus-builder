Broomrape,  (genus Orobanche),  genus of about 150 species of parasiticannual or perennial herbs (family Orobanchaceae). Broomrapes produce little or no chlorophyll; instead, they draw nourishment from the roots of other plants by means of small suckers called haustoria. Most species are primarily subterranean and appear aboveground only to reproduce. The flowers are irregularly shaped and produce single-chambered capsules that contain numerous minute seeds. The plants have scales in place of leaves and may be yellowish, brownish, purplish, or white in colour.
A number of broomrape species are serious agricultural threats. Hemp broomrape (O. ramosa), also known as branched broomrape, is a noxious pest around the world and can cause significant losses if crops are heavily infested. Especially common in tomatoes, hemp broomrape can parasitize a variety of vegetable crops, and its tiny seeds are usually spread by contaminated soil or crop seeds. As the broomrape seeds are long-lived and difficult to detect, infested fields are usually quarantined to prevent further spread.
The taxonomy of the group is somewhat contentious, and the American species of broomrape are sometimes placed in the genus Aphyllon.
