Aechmea,  genus of epiphytes (plants that are supported by other plants and have aerial roots exposed to the humid atmosphere) of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae), with more than 180 species distributed in tropical America. Spiny-edged leaves, usually about 30 to 60 cm (about 12 to 24 inches) long, grow in a rosette from the root. A spike of red and yellow flowers, often with blue tips, grows from the centre. Many species are grown as indoor ornamentals for their colourful foliage or showy flowers. The fibrous leaves of A. magdalenae, native to Central and South America, are made into rope and twine.
