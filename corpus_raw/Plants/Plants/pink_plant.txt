Pink,  (genus Dianthus),  genus of approximately 300 species of several flowering plants in the pink family (Caryophyllaceae). Nearly all are natives of the Eastern Hemisphere and are found chiefly in the Mediterranean region. Several are cultivated as garden ornamentals, and most are suited to rock gardens.
Pinks are mostly short herbaceous perennials, many of which are tufted or mat-forming hardy evergreens. There are also some annual forms. The small but showy and often fragrant flowers are mostly pink to deep rose, with some being red, purple, white, or yellow. Both annual and perennial Dianthus species may be grown from seed sown in the spring in ordinary moist garden soil in a sunny location. The perennials will bloom the following summer and may be increased by cuttings or division of clumps.
Especially noteworthy are the fragrant-flowered grass, or cottage, pink (Dianthus plumarius); maiden, or meadow, pink (D. deltoides); and rainbow, or China, pink (D. chinensis). Other important plants of the genus Dianthus are also sometimes referred to as pinks. The popular carnation (D. caryophyllus), for example, is often called clove pink in reference to its spicy scent, and sweet William (D. barbatus), a garden favourite, is often called bunch pink.
