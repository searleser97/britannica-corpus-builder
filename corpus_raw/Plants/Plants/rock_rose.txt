Rock rose,  (Cistus), any of a genus of 18 species of low to medium-sized shrubs, in the rock rose family (Cistaceae), native to the Mediterranean region and long known to horticulture. There are a number of garden hybrids useful in warm areas (mostly including C. ladanifer as one of the parents), where they are often grown in rock gardens. The large flowers are single and roselike, in white, pink, or rosy-purple, often with a yellowish or dark blotch at the base of the petals. The foliage is scented, often containing highly flammable resins.
C. ladanifer has white petals, red-brown at the bases, and yields a resin, called labdanum, used in perfumery. C. albidus, up to 2 metres (6 feet) high, has lilac- to rose-coloured flowers. C. palhinhae, a low shrub, reaching about 45 cm (1.5 feet), bears large white flowers up to 10 cm (4 inches) across. C. incanus, growing to about 1 metre (3 feet), has rose-pink flowers up to 6 cm (2.4 inches) across.
The so-called sun roses, related plants of the genus Helianthemum (family Cistaceae), are also sometimes referred to as rock roses (see sun rose).
