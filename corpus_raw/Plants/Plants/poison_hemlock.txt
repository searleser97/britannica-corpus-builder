Poison hemlock,  (Conium maculatum),  poisonous herbaceous plant of the parsley family (Apiaceae). Poison hemlock is native to Europe and North Africa and has been introduced to Asia, North America, and Australia. All parts of the plant contain the poisonous alkaloid coniine and are toxic to livestock and humans; ingestion of even small amounts can cause respiratory collapse and death. According to tradition, poison hemlock was the plant used to kill the philosopher Socrates.
Poison hemlock is a hairless biennial plant that flowers in its second year. In the first year, the lacy pinnately compound leaves form a basal rosette, and the white taproot is long and fleshy. The hollow branching stem is typically spotted or streaked with red or purple toward the base and reaches up to 2.5 metres (8 feet) in height when flowering. The small white flowers are borne in a flat-topped cluster known as an umbel and produce copious amounts of seeds.
The related water hemlocks (Cicuta species) are similar in appearance and also dangerous. The plants can be distinguished by their venation: the leaflet veins of the poison hemlock terminate at the tips of the teeth, while those of water hemlocks end at the notches between the teeth.
