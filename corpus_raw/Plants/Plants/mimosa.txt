Mimosa,  (genus Mimosa),  large genus of plants in the pea family (Fabaceae), native to tropical and subtropical areas throughout both hemispheres. They are so named from the movements of the leaves in certain species that “mimic” animal sensibility. The well-known sensitive plant, or humble plant (Mimosa pudica), is commonly grown in greenhouses as a novelty for its rapid leaf movements in response to touch. Various other species are cultivated as ornamentals for the beauty of their foliage.
Most Mimosa species are herbs or undershrubs, some are woody climbers, and a few are trees. They are often prickly. The leaves of most are bipinnate (i.e., the leaflets of the feather-formed leaves, in turn, bear leaflets). The roots of some species are poisonous; others contain substances irritating to the skin. The plants are characterized by small regular flowers and produce legume fruits. In addition to those responsive to physical stimuli, a few species have leaves that are sensitive to light and droop in response to darkness.
Many species of the related genus Acacia are commonly but erroneously called mimosas.
