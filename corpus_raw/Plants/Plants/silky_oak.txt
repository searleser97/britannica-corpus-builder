Silky oak, also called Silk Oak,   (Grevillea robusta), large tree native to Australia and also grown as a street tree in warm areas and, in its juvenile stage, as an indoor pot plant. It belongs to the family Proteaceae (see Proteales).
In Australia it is cut for timber, but elsewhere it is valued for its graceful, feathery foliage and orange flower clusters at the ends of leafless branches.
