Hyenia,  genus of herbaceous plants from the Middle Devonian Epoch (about 398 to 385 million years ago). Hyenia grew as a robust rhizome up to 5 cm (2 inches) in diameter and parallel to the soil surface. Upright branches up to 15 cm (about 6 inches) in height arose from the rhizome in a low spiral. Some branches divided several times to form flattened leaflike structures. Others bore additional smaller branches tipped with a pair of elongate sporangia that opened along a lateral slit to release spores. Little is known about its vascular system; however, its prostrate, creeping rhizome and leaflike appendages have led some authorities to suggest that Hyenia may be an early member of the fern lineage.
