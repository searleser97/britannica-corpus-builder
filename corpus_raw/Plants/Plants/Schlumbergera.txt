Schlumbergera,  genus of six species of spineless cacti (family Cactaceae) native to rainforests in Brazil. The plants grow as epiphytes, mainly on trees or shrubs but sometimes in shady places among rocks. Several species are grown for their striking elongated flowers.
Members of the genus are leafless cacti that have photosynthetic stem segments known as cladodes. In some species the stem segments are flattened, whereas in others they are rounded. The flowers are commonly borne horizontally and are adapted to pollination by hummingbirds. They have 20–30 tepals (undifferentiated petals and sepals) that fuse to form a floral tube. Characteristically, some of the numerous stamens are fused at the base of the flower, while others arise from the floral tube. The fleshy fruit may be smooth or ribbed, depending on the species.
The Thanksgiving, or crab, cactus (Schlumbergera truncata) and S. russelliana have short flattened stem segments. The common Christmas cactus (S. ×buckleyi), blooming about Christmastime in the Northern Hemisphere, is a hybrid of these two species. S. kautskyi, S. opuntioïdes, S. orssichiana, and S. microsphaerica have rounded stem segments but bear similar flowers. Several species are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
