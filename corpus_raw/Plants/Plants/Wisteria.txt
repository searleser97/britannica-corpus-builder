Wisteria,  (genus Wisteria), also spelled wistaria,  genus of 8â€“10 species of twining, usually woody vines of the pea family (Fabaceae). Wisterias are mostly native to Asia and North America but are widely cultivated in other regions for their attractive growth habit and beautiful profuse flowers. In some places outside their native range, the plants have escaped cultivation and are considered invasive species.
Most species are large and fast-growing and can tolerate poor soils. The alternate leaves are pinnately compound (feather formed) with up to 19 leaflets. The flowers, which grow in large, drooping clusters, are blue, purple, rose, or white. The seeds are borne in long, narrow legumes and are poisonous. The plants usually take several years to start flowering and thus are usually cultivated from cuttings or grafts.
Cultivated species include Japanese wisteria (Wisteria floribunda), native to Japan and the hardiest member of the genus; American wisteria (W. frutescens), native to the southeastern United States; and Chinese wisteria (W. sinensis), native to China.
