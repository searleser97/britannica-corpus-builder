Bur cucumber,  (genus Sicyos),  genus of about 60 species of prostrate or climbing vines in the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae). Bur cucumbers often have sticky hairy stems and feature sharply lobed leaves and forked vining tendrils. Clusters of five-petaled unisexual flowers are typically borne at the ends of long stalks that arise from the leaf axils. The oval fruits are prickly or hairy and contain a single seed. One species (Sicyos angulatus), known also as star cucumber, is native to North America and is considered a noxious agricultural weed.
