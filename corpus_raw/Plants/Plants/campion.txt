Campion,  (genus Silene), also called catchfly,  genus of about 900 species of herbaceous flowering plants of the pink, or carnation, family (Caryophyllaceae). Campions are distributed throughout the world, and several are ornamental rock-garden or border plants.
Some species of Silene stand erect; others are spreading or cushion plants. The stems often are covered with a sticky material to which insects may adhere—hence the common name “catchfly,” though the plants are not considered carnivorous. The smooth-edged leaves are arranged opposite each other on the stem. The fruit is a capsule. Some species have solitary flowers; others have branched clusters of red, white, or pink flowers. Each of the five petals has a narrow, stalklike base, sometimes with scales at the junction of the base and the broad upper part.
Bladder campion (Silene vulgaris) has large, white, drooping flowers, and it has subspecies in different habitats throughout Europe. Many species are cultivated. Maltese Cross, or Jerusalem Cross (S. chalcedonica), has flowers of such a bright scarlet that they can be difficult to integrate into border plantings. Flower-of-Jove (S. flos-jovis) and Caucasian campion, or autumn catchfly (S. schafta), are popular in rock gardens.
African dream root (S. undulata), native to southern Africa, has been used by diviners and shamans to induce prophetic states of lucid dreaming; it is considered sacred by the Xhosa people.
Members of the genus Lychnis are usually included in Silene, though the taxonomy of the groups has been contentious.
