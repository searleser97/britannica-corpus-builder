Pickaback plant, also called Piggyback Plant,   (Tolmiea menziesii), hairy-leaved herbaceous plant, in the family Saxifragaceae, native to western North America. The pickaback is a popular houseplant, particularly notable for its curious reproductive abilities: the leaves of the parent plant arise from an underground stem and, when mature, they produce new plantlets from buds at the base of their leaf blades.
Pickaback plant can be grown in shaded rock gardens in mild climates, as along the Pacific coastal United States but is primarily an indoor plant elsewhere.
