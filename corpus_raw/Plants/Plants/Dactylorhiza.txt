Dactylorhiza, also called marsh orchid,  genus of about 30 species of terrestrial orchids (family Orchidaceae) with palmately lobed root tubers. They grow in meadows and damp places throughout Eurasia and in parts of North Africa, Alaska, and some Atlantic islands. Some are cultivated as garden ornamentals.
Dactylorhiza species are perennial plants with succulent leaves. The flowers are borne in a terminal spike and are typically white, pale pink, or magenta in colour. The fruits are capsules.
All species were formerly included in the genus Dactylorchis. The early marsh orchid (Dactylorhiza incarnata), elder-flowered orchid (D. sambucina), and spotted orchid (D. fuchsii) are common European species.
