Sweet gum,  (genus Liquidambar), sometimes spelled sweetgum,  genus of 15 species of deciduous trees, the only genus of the family Altingiaceae. Sweet gums are native to North America and Asia and are valued as a source of resin and timber. Several species are grown as ornamental trees for their showy fall foliage. The taxonomy of the group has been contentious; some species have been ascribed to the genus Altingia, and the group was formerly placed in the family Hamamelidaceae.
Sweet gums are large trees that bear alternate, sharply (three- to seven-lobed) palmate leaves. The plants produce upright spikes of greenish male flowers and round drooping clusters of female flowers on the same tree. The fruits are spiny dark brown balls known as an aggregate of capsules. Each capsule contains several small seeds, and the fruits often persist through the winter.
The American sweet gum, or bilsted (Liquidambar styraciflua), which sometimes reaches 45 metres (150 feet) in moist lowlands but is usually half that height at maturity, is grown for its handsome foliage, shade, and scarlet autumnal colour. It is also valued for its heartwood, called red gum or satin walnut, which is used for quality furniture. The trees are tapped for liquidambar balm, though a more fragrant gum is collected from the Oriental, or Turkish, sweet gum (L. orientalis). The Formosan gum (L. formosana), with three-lobed leaves, is widely grown as a garden tree in mild climates.
