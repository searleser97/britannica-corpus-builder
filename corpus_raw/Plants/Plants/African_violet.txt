African violet,  (genus Saintpaulia),  genus of six species of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae native to higher elevations in tropical eastern Africa. African violets are common houseplants, especially Saintpaulia ionantha, and can thrive in low light conditions and bloom throughout the year. Hundreds of horticultural varieties have been developed for their various flower colours and shapes, including half-sized miniatures.
The members of Saintpaulia are small perennial herbs with thick, hairy, ovate leaves. These dark green leaves have long petioles (leaf stems) and are arranged in a basal cluster at the base of the plant. The violet-like flowers are bilaterally symmetric with five petals and can be violet, white, or pink in colour. The tiny seeds are produced in a capsule. The plants are easily propagated from leaf cuttings.
The genus Saintpaulia is named in honour of Walter, Freiherr (baron) von Saint Paul-Illaire, a German colonial official who is credited with their discovery by Europeans in German East Africa (now Tanzania) in 1892.
