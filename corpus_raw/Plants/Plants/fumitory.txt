Fumitory,  (genus Fumaria),  genus of about 60 species of annual plants in the poppy family (Papaveraceae). Fumitory species are native to Eurasia and Africa and have been introduced to Australia and the Americas. Several of the plants are used in herbal medicine.
Common, or drug, fumitory (Fumaria officinalis) is a 90-cm- (3-foot-) tall climbing plant with lacy leaves and spikelike sprays of white or pinkish tubular flowers. The plant is native to Europe and Asia and has naturalized in parts of North America, having escaped cultivation. Once regarded as a medicinal herb, it was also used in Great Britain, boiled in water or milk, as a cosmetic.
The related climbing fumitory (Adlumia fungosa), also known as Allegheny vine or mountain fringe, is a sprawling herbaceous biennial that coils its long leafstalks around supports. It reaches 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) in height and has clusters of white or pinkish tubular flowers borne among delicately cut leaves. The only species of its genus, it is native to moist woodlands and freshly burned areas from eastern to central North America and across Asia.
