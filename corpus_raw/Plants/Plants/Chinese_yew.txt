Chinese yew,   (Taxus celebica), a large, ornamental evergreen shrub or tree of the yew family (Taxaceae), widespread in China at elevations up to 900 metres (3,000 feet). The tree is up to 14 m (46 ft) tall and wide and bushy when cultivated. The leaves are up to 4 centimetres (1 1/2 inches) long—broader than those of most other yews—and often end in a very small, sharp point. The underside of each leaf has two broad yellow stripes and is densely covered with minute projections.
