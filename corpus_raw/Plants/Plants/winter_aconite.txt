winter aconite,  (genus Eranthis),  genus of about seven species of perennial herbaceous plants of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) native to temperate regions of Europe and widely planted for their early spring flowers.
The solitary flowers consist of five to eight yellow or white sepals (petals are reduced or absent) and multiple stamens. They arise on short stalks from tuberous roots and are often among the first spring flowers to appear, frequently emerging when there is still snow on the ground. The divided leaves are pelate, meaning the leaf stem is attached in the centre of the leaf, and persist only until mid-spring, at which point the plant dies back.
Common winter aconite (Eranthis hyemalis), a frequently cultivated species, grows about 20 cm (8 inches) tall or less and has flowers 2.5 cm across.
