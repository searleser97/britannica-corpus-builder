Crown of thorns,  (Euphorbia milii), also called Christ thorn,  thorny plant of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), native to Madagascar. Crown of thorns is popular as a houseplant and is grown in warm climates as a garden shrub. Flowering is year-round but most plentiful in wintertime in the Northern Hemisphere. The common name refers to the thorny crown Jesus was forced to wear during his crucifixion, with the red bracts of the flowers representing his blood.
Crown of thorns is a hardy perennial with stout gray thorns and oval leaves that drop as they age. The sprawling, branching, vinelike stems can attain lengths of more than two metres (seven feet), though potted plants are considerably smaller. The small inconspicuous flowers are borne in paired clusters and are surrounded by two showy light red bracts (leaflike structures attached just below flowers). Various forms are available with yellow or deep red bracts. The white milky sap is poisonous and can cause skin and eye irritation.
