blackthorn,  (Prunus spinosa), also called sloe,  spiny shrub of the rose family (Rosaceae), native to Europe but cultivated in other regions. Blackthorn usually grows less than 3.6 metres (12 feet) tall and has numerous small deciduous leaves. Its dense growth makes it suitable for hedges. The white flowers, about 2 cm (0.8 inch) in diameter, have five petals and appear before the leaves. The tart bluish black fruit is a drupe, about 2 cm in diameter, and is used to flavour sloe gin.
