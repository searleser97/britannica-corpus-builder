Acorales,  the sweet flag order of flowering plants and the most basal lineage among the monocotyledons (monocots), which are characterized by having a single seed leaf. This order contains the single family Acoraceae and one genus (Acorus), which comprises two to four species of plants that resemble the irises.
Acorus calamus (sweet flag) occurs in the wetlands of North America and from India to Indonesia. Other species are distributed in temperate areas in Asia and Europe, where they are often found at pond margins or along fast-moving streams.
Sweet flag has been used as an herbal ingredient at least since the Classical Greek era. Both A. calamus and A. gramineus are commonly cultivated as ornamentals in gardens.
Acorus was formerly placed in the family Araceae because of the clustering of the minute, perfect (bisexual) flowers into a spadix, but it was later realized that Acorus differs in several respectsâ€”notably, in having unifacial rather than bifacial leaves, introrse rather than extrorse anthers (with the anther opening toward the inside of the flower rather than toward the outside), dry rather than fleshy fruits, ethereal oils and not raphides, and apical rather than basal placentation. In addition, investigations employing DNA sequencing techniques have shown that this genus is distinctive from the Araceae and should be placed as the basal lineage to all other monocots. Given these morphological and genetic differences, a separate family and order are considered justified by most botanists.
