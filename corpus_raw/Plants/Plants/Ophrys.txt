Ophrys,  genus of about 30 species of orchids (family Orchidaceae) native to Eurasia and North Africa. All have metallic-coloured hairy flowers that resemble the females of various insect species and use sexual deception as a means of pollination. The fly orchid (Ophrys insectifera) and the bee orchid (O. apifera) are common European species. Some species of Ophrys are known as spider orchids because their flower lips resemble the bodies of spiders.
Ophrys species are terrestrial orchids and are generally less than 30 cm (1 foot) tall. They bear several flowers on a single spike. The labellum (central petal) of the flower is highly modified to lure specific species of bees or wasps with its colours, textures, and even scent. Thus deceived, male insects attempt to mate with the flowers in an act known as pseudocopulation. During this process, pollinia (pollen sacs) become attached to the insectâ€™s body and are transferred to the next flowers visited. Unlike the mutualisms of other plant-pollinator interactions, the male insects receive nothing in return for their efforts and often expend significant amounts of energy in their futile mating attempts.
