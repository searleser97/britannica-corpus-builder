Holly,  (genus Ilex),  genus of some 600 species of shrubs and trees in the family Aquifoliaceae, distributed nearly worldwide. Several species are cultivated as ornamentals for their distinctive foliage and red or black fruits, which persist into winter and are popular Christmas decorations. Mate, a tealike beverage common in parts of South America, is made from the leaves of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis).
Hollies have alternate simple leaves, and the leaves of many species have wavy margins tipped with spines. The plants can be evergreen or deciduous. The single or clustered, usually greenish small flowers are unisexual and have four petals, and the male and female flowers are usually borne on separate plants. The fruits are drupes and are an important winter food for many bird species; most are not safe for human consumption.
English holly (I. aquifolium), a tree growing to 15 metres (nearly 50 feet) tall, bears shining spiny dark evergreen leaves and usually red fruits. The somewhat taller American holly (I. opaca) has oblong prickly leaves and usually red fruits. There are spineless and yellow-fruited forms of both species.
Chinese holly (I. cornuta), from East Asia, a shrub reaching 3 metres (10 feet), produces scarlet berries among shining evergreen leaves. Japanese holly (I. crenata), an East Asian shrub growing to 6 metres (20 feet), has small evergreen leaves and black berries.
Yaupon (I. vomitoria), a shrubby tree reaching 8 metres (26 feet), bears oval leaves and red berries. It is native to eastern North America, as is the deciduous winterberry (I. verticillata). Possum haw (I. decidua), also deciduous, bears red fruits on a shrub growing to 10 metres (33 feet).
A number of holly species are listed as endangered species by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and at least one, I. gardneriana, is extinct because of habitat loss.
