Guzmania,   genus of about 85 species of tropical American and West Indian epiphytes (plants that are supported by other plants and have aerial roots exposed to the humid atmosphere) and terrestrial plants of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae). Several species are grown indoors for their handsome foliage and flowers.
Guzmania leaves are stiff, often stemless or short-stemmed, and grow in a rosette. The yellow or white flowers grow on stalks in clusters that often have showy bracts (leaflike appendages beneath the flowers).
