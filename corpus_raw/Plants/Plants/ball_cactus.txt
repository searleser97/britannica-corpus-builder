Ball cactus,  (genus Parodia),  genus of 60â€“70 species of cacti (family Cactaceae) native to the grasslands of South America. Several species are commonly cultivated as potted plants, including silver ball cactus (Parodia scopa) and golden ball cactus (P. leninghausii), which are especially valued for their woolly appearance.
Ball cacti are generally small and globose to cylindroid in shape. Many species are deeply ribbed and usually bear clusters of spines surrounded by white or yellow glochids (hairlike spines). The flowers are typically yellow to red and borne along the crown. Some species have small flowers of only about 1 cm (0.5 inch) in diameter, while others grow up to about 6 cm (2.4 inches). Plants can be singular or may produce offsets at the base.
