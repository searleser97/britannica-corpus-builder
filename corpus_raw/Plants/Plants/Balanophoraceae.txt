Balanophoraceae,  the balanophora family of flowering plants, which includes about 18 genera containing more than 100 species of root parasites that are distributed primarily throughout the tropics. Balanophoraceae has sometimes been placed by most authorities in its own order, Balanophorales, but the family is now placed in the sandalwood order, Santalales, within the core eudicots. The club-shaped flower spikes of balanophora plants resemble fungi in their appearance and also in their emergence from the soil. The unisexual flowers range in colour from pale yellow to deep purple. The unlobed, scalelike leaves lack the chlorophyll necessary for food production, and thus the plants must obtain their nourishment by parasitizing other plants. Balanophoraceae species attach their tuberous rhizomes (underground stems) to the roots of host trees by means of highly modified roots (haustoria), through which water and nutrients pass from host to parasite. Plants of the genera Balanophora and Langsdorffia contain an inflammable waxy material, and the stems have been used as candles in South America. The rhizomes of these plants are sometimes processed to produce wax, but the plants are not abundant enough for commercial wax production.
