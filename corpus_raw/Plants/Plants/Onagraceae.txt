Onagraceae,  evening primrose family of flowering plants, belonging to the myrtle order (Myrtales), comprising 18 genera and 655 species, and concentrated in the temperate region of the New World. The family is characterized by flowers with parts mostly on the plan of four (four sepals, four petals, four or eight stamens), but there are some exceptions. The ovary is inferior (i.e., below the flower proper). In the temperate zone the family is known from genera such as Epilobium, including the great willow herb, or fireweed (E. angustifolium). Another well-known genus is Oenothera (with about 80 species), which has been of great importance in studies in genetics and evolution.
In wet places, especially in warmer parts of both the Old and the New World, is another large day-blooming genus, Ludwigia, 75 species of water and marsh plants, mostly of eastern North America, ranging from annual herbs to large shrubs. Some other genera of the family are Boisduvalia; Circaea, enchanterâ€™s nightshade, with hooked bristles on the fruits; Gaura, with small nutlike, indehiscent fruits; Gayophytum, thread-stemmed annuals with minute flowers; and Hauya of Mexico and Central America, shrubby or treelike, with large white to pinkish flowers. See also evening primrose; Fuchsia.
