Century plant,  any of several species of Agave in the asparagus family (Asparagaceae). The name is commonly applied to A. americana, which is grown as an ornamental in many places and is a source of the fibre maguey and of “agave nectar” used as a sweetener. Despite their common name, most century plants do not live longer than 30 years; each rosette of leaves usually dies after flowering, though clonal pups at the base may persist.
