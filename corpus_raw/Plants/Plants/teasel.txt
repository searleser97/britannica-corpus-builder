Teasel,  (genus Dipsacus),  genus of about 15 species in the honeysuckle family (Caprifoliaceae), native to Europe, the Mediterranean area, and tropical Africa. The plants are sometimes grown as ornamentals or to attract birds, and the dried flower heads are used in the floral industry.
Many teasels are prickly, coarse biennials with opposite leaves that join at the base to form a rainwater-holding trough around the stem. The tall-domed heads of numerous four-lobed flowers sit on a crownlike circle of spiny narrow bracts (leaflike structures). Male parts mature before female parts to ensure cross-pollination. The dried inflorescence persists after flowering, and the seeds are an important food for birds.
Fuller’s teasel (Dipsacus sativus), nearly 1 metre (3 feet) tall, bears pale lilac heads of flowers with hooked bracts. The spiny dry fruiting heads have been used since Roman times to raise the nap of woolen fabrics in a process known as fulling. The plant is raised commercially in both Europe and North America for this purpose, though the use of Fuller’s teasel has largely been replaced by mechanical methods.
Common teasel (D. fullonum) is similar to Fuller’s teasel but has upright rather than hooked bracts that are not useful for fulling. Common teasel is treated as a weed in both Europe and North America.
D. inermis from the Himalayas produces white flowers and leaves that are divided into many segments. Shepherd’s rod, or small teasel (D. pilosus), native to Europe, has a globe-shaped flower head and white blooms with violet anthers.
