California nutmeg,  (Torreya californica), also called stinking nutmeg, or California torreya,  ornamental evergreen conifer of the yew family (Taxaceae), found naturally only in California. Growing to a height of 24 metres (about 79 feet) or more, the tree bears spreading, slightly drooping branches. Although pyramidal in shape when young, it may be round-topped in old age. The fissured bark is grayish brown in colour, with orange streaks showing through. The dark-green, rigid, needlelike leaves are nearly flat and are usually about 4 to 8 cm (1.5 to 3 inches) long and 3 mm (about 0.1 inch) broad, tapering to a spiny point. Leaves, branches, and wood have a pungent scent. The plants are dioecious, meaning male and female cones are borne on separate individuals. The aril, or seed covering, is oval, 2 to 3 cm (0.8 to 1.2 inches) long, and light green, usually with purple streaks. The oil-rich seeds were used as food by native peoples and are unrelated to true nutmeg (Myristica fragrans).
