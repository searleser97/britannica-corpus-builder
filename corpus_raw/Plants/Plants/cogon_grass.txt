Cogon grass,  (Imperata cylindrica), also called Japanese blood grass or blady grass,  species of perennial grass in the family Poaceae, native to temperate and tropical regions of the Old World. Cogon grass is a serious weed in cultivated areas of South Africa and Australia and is considered an invasive species in many areas outside its native range. Some cultivars are grown as ornamentals, and the plant is commonly used for erosion control.
Cogon grass grows 0.6–3 metres (2–10 feet) tall and has roots that can reach more than 1 metre (3.3 feet) long. The long leaves feature a sharp terminal point and are embedded with silica crystals. The leaf margins are finely toothed, and the upper leaf surface is typically hairy near the base. The small wind-pollinated flowers are borne in a thin cluster, and each spikelet bears many long silky hairs.
