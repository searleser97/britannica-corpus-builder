Gherkin,  (Cucumis anguria), also called bur gherkin or West Indian gherkin,  annual trailing vine of the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), grown for its edible fruit. The plant is likely native to southern Africa and is grown in warm climates around the world. Gherkin fruits are served raw, cooked, or pickled, though the “gherkins” sold in commercial pickle mixtures are usually small, immature fruits of the common cucumber (C. sativus).
The gherkin plant has palmately lobed leaves with toothed edges and can reach 2.5 metres (8 feet) in length. It bears small unisexual flowers and produces furrowed prickly fruits about 5 cm (2 inches) long. The plant is intolerant of frost and is fairly resistant to most pests and diseases.
The Mexican sour gherkin, or mouse melon (Melothria scabra), is not a true gherkin; it is grown for its tiny savory fruits that superficially resemble watermelons.
