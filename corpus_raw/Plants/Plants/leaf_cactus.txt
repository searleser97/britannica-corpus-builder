Leaf cactus,  (genus Epiphyllum), also called orchid cactus,  genus of about 15 species of cacti (family Cactaceae), native to tropical and subtropical America, including the West Indies. The plants are mostly epiphytic (grow on other plants) but sometimes grow from the ground. A number of species and hybrids are often grown in cultivation for their showy flowers.
The plants have flattened nonspiny stems that function as leaves. Flowers are red, white, or yellow and are borne on tubes up to 38 cm (about 15 inches) long. They are usually nocturnal and often fragrant and are among the largest flowers in the cactus family. Many species have edible fruit.
