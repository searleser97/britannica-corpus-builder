Tectariaceae,  the halberd fern family (order Polypodiales), containing 7â€“10 genera and about 230 species. Tectariaceae is distributed nearly worldwide but is most diverse in tropical regions. Most members of the family are classified in Tectaria, which comprises 150 or more species and is one of the largest fern genera.
Leaf morphology across the family is extremely variable. The sori (clusters of spore-producing structures) are commonly round and often covered with a membranous protective flap of tissue called an indusium. The spores are bean-shaped (bilateral). Most species are terrestrial or grow on rocks.
