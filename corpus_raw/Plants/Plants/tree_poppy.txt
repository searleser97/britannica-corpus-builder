The tree poppy ranges from 0.5 to 3 metres (about 2 to 10 feet) in height. The plant displays deep butter-yellow four- or six-petaled blooms measuring 4 to 5 cm (1.5 to 2 inches) across, with many stamens and a two-lobed stigma. The plantâ€™s narrow gray-green waxy leaves are evergreen, and the bark is shreddy and yellow-gray.
