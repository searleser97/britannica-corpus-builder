Tamarisk,  (genus Tamarix), any of 54 species of shrubs and low trees (family Tamaricaceae) that, with false tamarisks (Myricaria, 10 species), grow in salt deserts, by seashores, in mountainous areas, and in other semiarid localities from the Mediterranean region to central Asia and northern China. Many have been introduced into North America. They have deep-ranging roots and long, slender branches with numerous small, gray-green, scalelike leaves. Clusters of small pink flowers, hanging at the ends of branches or from the trunks, give the plants a feathery appearance. Each flower has 4 or 5 free sepals, 4 or 5 petals, and from 4 to 10 stamens. The petals and stamens arise from a fleshy disk. In Tamarix the stamens are separate; in Myricaria they are united. The fruit is a capsule with numerous seeds; each seed has a long tuft of hairs at one end.
Tamarisks are valued for their ability to withstand drought, soil salinity, and salt-water spray. The salt cedar, or French tamarisk (T. gallica), is planted on seacoasts for shelter; it is cultivated in the United States from South Carolina to California. The Athel tree (T. aphylla), which sometimes grows to about 18 metres (60 feet), has jointed twigs and minute ensheathing leaves and is used as a windbreak in desert areas. T. ramosissima (or T. pentandra) and T. chinensis, with denser flower clusters, are frequently cultivated as ornamentals. Several species that have been introduced into western North America, however, are considered serious pests because they draw out scarce water with their deep roots and displace native species.
