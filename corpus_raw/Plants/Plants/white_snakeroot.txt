White snakeroot,  (Ageratina altissima), also called white sanicle,  poisonous North American herb of the aster family (Asteraceae). White snakeroot contains a toxic alcohol (tremetol), and cattle allowed to pasture on the plant may suffer muscular tremors (the “trembles”), weakness, constipation, and death. Persons who drink the milk of affected cows may experience milk sickness, a condition that is marked by weakness, vomiting, and constipation and can be fatal. Milk sickness was responsible for the deaths of thousands of settlers in the American Midwest in the early 19th century. See also snakeroot poisoning.
White snakeroot is a perennial plant that can grow up to 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall. It can be single-stemmed or clumping and has 18-cm (7-inch) leaves opposite each other. The small white flowers are borne in flat-topped clusters and produce wind-dispersed seeds.
White snakeroot was formerly placed in the large genus Eupatorium.
