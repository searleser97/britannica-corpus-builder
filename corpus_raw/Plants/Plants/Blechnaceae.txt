Blechnaceae,  the chain fern family (order Polypodiales), containing 7â€“9 genera and more than 200 species. The family occurs nearly around the world but is most diverse in tropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Nearly all of the species are terrestrial or grow on rocks. A number of species of Blechnum (deer fern), Doodia (hacksaw fern), and Woodwardia (chain fern) are cultivated as ornamentals in gardens, greenhouses, conservatories, and homes.
Leaf morphology across the family is extremely variable, ranging from pinnately lobed to several times pinnately compound, and the vegetative and fertile leaves are dimorphic in some genera. Some species of Blechnum and Sadleria develop short, stout, trunklike stems and stiff, leathery leaves, which give them the appearance more of a cycad than a typical fern. The sori vary from bean-shaped to linear and in most genera are positioned along both sides of the midrib of the leaflets or leaf divisions. Occasionally, they appear to cover the entire surface of the underside of fertile leaves. Often they are covered with a membranous protective flap of tissue (indusium), which is attached laterally along the inner side of the sorus. The spores are mostly bean-shaped (bilateral).
