Cannabis,  (genus Cannabis),  genus of medicinal, recreational, and fibre plants belonging to the family Cannabaceae. By some classifications, the genus Cannabis comprises a single species, hemp (Cannabis sativa), a stout, aromatic, erect annual herb that originated in Central Asia and is now cultivated worldwide. A tall canelike variety is raised for the production of hemp fibre, while the female plants of a short branchier variety are prized as the more abundant source of the psychoactive substance tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient of marijuana. See also medical cannabis.
Morphological differences in wild and cultivated forms of cannabis have introduced taxonomic uncertainties. Hence, in addition to C. sativa, some scientists consider the genus as including a second species, C. indica, and even a third, C. ruderalis. These two species are also sometimes treated as subspecies of C. sativa.
