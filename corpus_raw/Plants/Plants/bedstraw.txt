Bedstraw,  (genus Galium), also called cleavers,  plant genus of about 400 species of low-growing annual or perennial herbs in the madder family (Rubiaceae). They can be found in damp woods and swamps and along stream banks and shores throughout the world. Bedstraw plants are characterized by finely toothed, often needle-shaped leaves borne in whorls of four to eight along square or rounded stems. The small flowers, borne in clusters, are green, yellow, or white. The fruit is composed of two rounded nuts joined together and frequently covered in hooked bristles to promote animal dispersal. The plants commonly reproduce asexually by spreading rhizomes and stolons.
Northern bedstraw (G. boreale), common marsh bedstraw (G. palustre), and goosegrass (G. aparine) are common throughout Europe and have become naturalized in parts of North America. Sweet woodruff, or sweet scented bedstraw (G. odoratum, formerly Asperula odorata), has an odour similar to that of freshly mown hay; its dried shoots are used in perfumes and sachets and for flavouring beverages. Ladyâ€™s bedstraw, or yellow bedstraw (G. verum), is used in Europe to curdle milk and to colour cheese. The roots of several species of Galium yield a red dye, and many were used historically to stuff mattresses, hence their common name.
