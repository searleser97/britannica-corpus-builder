Torchwood,  (genus Amyris),  any of 40 tropical species of large shrubs or trees found in the Americas that burn well due to the high resin content of its wood. Sea torchwood (A. elemifera) grows along the coasts of Florida, and balsam torchwood (A. balsamifera) is known especially from Cuba. Incense and aromatic oils are derived from torchwood, and extracts from the Mexican A. plumieri are used in lacquers.
The leaves of torchwood are glossy and grow in sets of three leaflets; the fruits are cherrylike. The wood is yellowish brown and streaked. When used as timber it is sometimes called candlewood. Amyris belongs to the family Burseracae.
