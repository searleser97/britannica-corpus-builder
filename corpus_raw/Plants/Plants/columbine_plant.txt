Columbine,  any of approximately 100 species of perennial herbaceous plants constituting the genus Aquilegia of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) native to Europe and North America. Several species of columbine and a number of hybrids are cultivated for their attractive flowers.
Columbines are distinctive for their five-petaled flowers that have long, backward-extending spurs as pouchlike extensions of the petals, which contain nectar. Sepals and petals are brightly coloured. The leaflets of the compound leaves are usually rounded and notched.
The common European columbine (A. vulgaris) grows 45–75 cm (18–30 inches) tall along roadsides and woodland edges. The species and its several hybrids, which are known for their nodding flowers with short incurved spurs, are cultivated widely in North America. From A. caerulea and A. chysantha, both native to the Rocky Mountains, have been developed many garden hybrids with showy long-spurred flowers in a variety of colours ranging from white to yellow, red, and blue. The wild columbine of North America (A. canadensis) grows in woods and on rocky ledges from southern Canada southward. It is 30 to 90 cm tall. The flowers are red with touches of yellow and are pollinated by hummingbirds.
