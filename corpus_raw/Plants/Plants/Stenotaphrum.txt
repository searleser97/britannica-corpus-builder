Stenotaphrum,  genus of about seven species of low mat-forming grasses of the family Poaceae, native to tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. St. Augustine grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum), also called buffalo grass, is cultivated as a coarse lawn grass in some areas of Australia and North America; the plant is native to the American South and to Central America but has become naturalized along many seacoasts of the world.
Members of the genus are annuals or perennials and spread vegetatively with stolons. The linear leaves typically have a hairy ligule (small appendage at the leaf base) and a loose sheath where they join the stem. The tiny flowers are borne in an unusual inflorescence in which the short stems of each flower are sunk into pockets on one or both sides of a thickened central axis.
