Neoregelia,  genus of about 40 species of epiphytes (plants that are supported by other plants and have aerial roots exposed to the humid atmosphere) of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae) native to tropical South America. Several species, including N. carolinae, are grown as indoor ornamentals for their colourful flowers and leaves.
Neoregelia leaves are often mottled, marbled, or banded. They form a rosette with small white, blue, or purple flowers deep in the centre of the cup. The leaves of some species bear spines or scales, and the central leaves often become coloured during flowering periods.
