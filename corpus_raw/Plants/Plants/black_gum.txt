Black gum,  (Nyssa sylvatica), also called sour gum or black tupelo,  tupelo tree (family Nyssaceae) prized for its brilliant scarlet autumnal foliage. It is found in moist areas of the eastern United States from Maine south to the Gulf Coast and westward to Oklahoma. Its wood is light and soft but tough, and the tree is sometimes grown as an ornamental.
Black gum features a straight trunk with unique bark that forms deep fissures with age. The trees typically reach 9–15 metres (30–50 feet) or more in height. The simple glossy leaves are entire to slightly toothed or wavy and are usually elliptic in shape. Small greenish white flowers are borne in clusters on long stalks and are an important nectar source for bees. The trees are largely dioecious, meaning that individuals usually bear only male or female flowers. The small dark drupes are attractive to birds and other wildlife.
