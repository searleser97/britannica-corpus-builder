Penthorum,  genus of two species of perennial herbs native to East Asia and eastern North America. The genus is treated as its own family, Penthoraceae, or is placed in the family Saxifragaceae. Both species have underground stems, toothed leaves, and one-sided flower clusters borne at the branch tips. The ditch, or Virginian, stonecrop (Penthorum sedoides) grows to about 60 cm (2 feet) tall. It has pale greenish yellow flowers and pale green leaves that turn bright orange as they mature. Ditch stonecrop is planted as an ornamental at the edges of pools or in shallow water. Oriental penthorum (P. chinense) reaches up to 90 cm (35 inches) in height and spreads with rhizomes.
