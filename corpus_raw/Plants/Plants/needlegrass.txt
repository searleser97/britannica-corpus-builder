Needlegrass,  (genus Stipa), also called feather grass,  genus of about 150 species of grasses in the family Poaceae, characterized by sharply pointed grains and long threadlike awns (bristles). Most needlegrasses provide good forage in dry areas before the seed is formed, but the sharp grain of some species may puncture the faces of grazing animals. Several species are grown as garden ornamentals, and esparto (Stipa tenacissima) is used to make ropes, cords, and paper.
Needlegrasses are annuals or perennials and grow from 0.3 to 1 metre (1 to 3.3 feet) tall. Many form dense tussocks (tufted bunches) with basal leaves, and some can spread vegetatively. The plants are monoecious, meaning male and females flowers are borne on the same individual. The flower clusters are feathery and characteristically bear spiklets with a single flower.
