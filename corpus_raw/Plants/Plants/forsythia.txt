Forsythia,  (genus Forsythia), also called golden bell,  genus of about seven species of flowering plants in the olive family (Oleaceae) native to eastern Europe and East Asia. Several are cultivated as low-maintenance fast-growing ornamental shrubs.
Forsythia plants are deciduous shrubs. In some species the yellow four-petaled flowers, borne along the stems, appear before the leaves in early spring. The simple narrow leaves occasionally have three parts and are borne oppositely along the pithy or hollow stems. The fruit is usually a capsule.
Green-stem forsythia (Forsythia viridissima), native to China, may grow to 3 metres (10 feet) tall; it bears greenish yellow flowers. Weeping forsythia (F. suspensa), also from China, has hollow pendulous stems about 3 metres long and golden-yellow flowers. Common forsythia (F. Ã—intermedia), a hybrid between green-stem forsythia and weeping forsythia, has arching stems and grows up to 3 metres (10 feet) tall with bright yellow flowers. There also are variegated, dwarf, and many-flowered varieties.
