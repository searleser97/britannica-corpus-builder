Monkey puzzle tree,  (Araucaria araucana), also called Chile pine,  an evergreen ornamental and timber conifer of the family Araucariaceae, native to the Andes Mountains of South America. Although the tree was declared a natural monument in Chile in 1976 to afford it protection from logging, the species is considered endangered in its native habitat because of illegal felling activity and habitat fragmentation.
The monkey puzzle tree may grow to a height of 45–50 metres (150–164 feet) with a diameter of 2.5 metres (8 feet) and may live for more than 700 years. Its spiral arrangement of rigid needle-pointed leaves along stiff branches inspired its common name, evoked by a comment about the challenge this prickly network might pose to climbing monkeys. The plants are usually dioecious, meaning male and female cones are most commonly borne on separate individuals. The female cones are somewhat spherical in shape and can produce about 200 edible seeds.
