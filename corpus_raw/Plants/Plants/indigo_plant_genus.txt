Indigo,  (genus Indigofera),  large genus of more than 750 species of shrubs, trees, and herbs in the pea family (Fabaceae). Some species, particularly true indigo (Indigofera tinctoria) and Natal indigo (I. arrecta), were once an important source of indigo dye. The cultivation of indigo plants and the extraction of the dyestuff were an important industry in India up to the beginning of the 20th century. Synthetic indigo, developed about that time, gradually replaced natural indigo as a dyestuff. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.
Indigo species are highly variable in appearance but are generally silky or hairy with compound leaves. The rose, purple, or white flowers are borne in showy spikes or clusters, and the fruit is a pod, usually with a thin partition between the seeds.
