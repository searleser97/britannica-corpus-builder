Patchouli,  (Pogostemon cablin),  aromatic flowering plant of the mint family (Lamiaceae), the leaves of which are a source of essential oil that is used as a fragrance in perfumes, cosmetics, and incense. Patchouli is native to tropical Asia, where it is widely cultivated and has been used for centuries for its essential oil.
Patchouli is a shrubby perennial plant that grows up to 1 metre (3 feet) in height. The large fragrant leaves are roughly oval in shape and irregularly toothed and are borne oppositely along the branching stems. Both the stems and the leaves are densely hairy. The small pale purple to white flowers are arranged in dense woolly spikes and have long stamens. The plants are commonly propagated from cuttings.
Patchouli essential oil is obtained from the shade-dried leaves by steam distillation. The oil is widely used in the manufacture of soaps, perfumes, detergents, cosmetics, and deodorants, although patchouli is not the dominant fragrance in many of these products. Patchouli essential oil has pleasing musky notes that augment other fragrances and has strong fixative properties. It is also used in aromatherapy and as a common fragrance for incense and candles. In traditional medicine, the oil is sometimes used topically to treat fungal skin infections, dandruff, and eczema and is used in baths for rheumatism. The leaves can be made into an herbal tea for a variety of digestive ailments and are used as a moth repellent for clothing.
