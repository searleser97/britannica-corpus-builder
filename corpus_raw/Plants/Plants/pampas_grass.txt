Pampas grass,  (Cortaderia selloana),  tall reedlike grass of the family Poaceae, native to southern South America. Pampas grass is named for the Pampas plains, where it is endemic. It is cultivated as an ornamental in warm parts of the world and is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range, including New Zealand, South Africa, and the southwestern United States.
Pampas grass is a perennial plant and can reach 4 metres (13 feet) in height. The long sharped-edged leaves fold at the midrib and form a dense tussock (tufted bunch). Female plants bear silvery plumelike flower clusters about 30 to 90 cm (1 to 3 feet) long. The feathery seeds are readily dispersed by the wind.
