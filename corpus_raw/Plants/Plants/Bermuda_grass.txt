Bermuda grass,  (Cynodon dactylon),  perennial turfgrass of the family Poaceae, native to the Mediterranean region. Bermuda grass is used in warm regions around the world as a lawn and pasture grass and for golf greens. It is considered an invasive species in Bermuda and various other places outside its native range.
Bermuda grass usually is 10 to 40 cm (4 to 16 inches) tall and has short flat leaves. The spikelets are borne in four or five slender spikes at the tips of the upright stems. Extensively creeping stolons and rhizomes (aboveground and underground horizontal stems) enable the plant to establish a dense turf.
