Cockscomb,  (Celosia cristata),  common garden plant of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae). Cockscombs are tender perennials but are usually grown as annuals in cooler climates. The plants produce dense undulating inflorescences that resemble the red combs on the heads of roosters, hence their common name; the colours range from white and yellow to shades of orange, red, and purple. The flowers can be dried and used in floral arrangements.
Cockscomb plants produce simple oval leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem and often are borne on a reddish petiole (leafstalk). The herbaceous plants grow some 23–81 cm (9–32 inches) in height, depending on the variety. The small flowers have colourful bracts and are densely arranged in showy inflorescences. They produce large amounts of seeds.
Silver cockscomb, or Lagos spinach (Celosia argentea), is a closely related ornamental and food plant. Its inflorescences are generally more spikelike than crested.
