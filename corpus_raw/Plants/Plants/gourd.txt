Gourd,  any of the hard-shelled ornamental fruits of certain members of the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae. Many gourds are cultivated as ornamentals or food crops, and some can be dried and used to make utensils, cups, bottles, scoops, ladles, fishnet floats, whistles, rattles, pipes, birdhouses, and other useful objects. Common species include the yellow-flowered gourd (Cucurbita pepo, subspecies ovifera) and the bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), as well as the wax gourd (Benincasa hispida), teasel gourd (Cucumis dipsaceus), snake gourd (Trichosanthes cucumerina), and loofah, or sponge gourd (species of the genus Luffa).
Most gourds are native to tropical or warm temperate climates. They require a long growing season to mature and are killed by frost. Well-drained fertile soil and a trellis, fence, or wall to provide support for the vines aid in the development of well-shaped unblemished fruits.
