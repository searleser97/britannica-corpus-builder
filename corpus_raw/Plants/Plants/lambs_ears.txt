lamb’s ears,  (Stachys byzantina), also called lamb’s ear,  perennial herb of the mint family (Lamiaceae), native to parts of the Middle East. Lamb’s ears are commonly grown as ornamentals for their attractive fuzzy leaves, which are reminiscent of the soft ears of young lambs.
The plants commonly reach about 60 cm (24 inches) in height and are covered with densely matted hairs known as trichomes. The simple oval leaves are bright green when young and mature to silver-green or white, depending on the density of the hairs. The small pink flowers are borne in clusters and produce nutlet fruits; some varieties rarely flower. The plants are drought tolerant and can rot in humid conditions.
