Akebia,  genus of woody vines comprising two species native to Asia but introduced elsewhere for their ornamental foliage and fast growth. The genus belongs to the family Lardizabalaceae.
Five-leaf akebia, or chocolate vine (A. quinata), has five leaflets to each leaf arranged like the fingers on a hand; three-leaf akebia (A. trifoliata) has three leaflets to a leaf. The purplish flowers are unisexual and occur in small clusters, and the oblong purple fruits are edible, though insipid. Both species are twining vines often used for shading and screening on arbors and fences and for ground covering on embankments.
