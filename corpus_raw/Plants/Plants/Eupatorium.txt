Eupatorium, also called thoroughwort,  genus of about 60 species of plants belonging to the aster family (Asteraceae). Members of the genus are found chiefly in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere, though some species are also found in tropical South America, the West Indies, and Mexico. Several are grown as ornamental plants, and a number have been used in folk medicine.
Eupatorium species are mostly perennial herbs, but a few are annuals, and many of the tropical species are shrubby or treelike. Members of the genus typically bear large showy clusters of purplish, pink, blue, or white flowers.
One of the most common species in the United States and Canada is boneset (Eupatorium perfoliatum), which grows to a height of 1.5 metres (5 feet) and bears white flowers.
