Sweet William,  (Dianthus barbatus), also called bunch pink or bearded pink,  garden plant in the pink family (Caryophyllaceae), grown for its clusters of small bright-coloured flowers. It is usually treated as a biennial, seed sown the first year producing flowering plants the second year. The plant, growing to a height of 60 cm (2 feet), produces numerous flowers—white, pink, rose to violet, or sometimes bicoloured—with fringed petals. It is used in the floral industry for its cut flowers. See also Dianthus.
Many sources contend that the flower was named for William Augustus, duke of Cumberland, who led British forces against the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. Other sources claim, however, that the name of the flower can be traced to the writings of Thomas Tusser, a 16th-century English poet. In Scotland the flower is known as stinking Willie or sour Billy.
