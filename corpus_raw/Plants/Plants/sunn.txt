Sunn,  (Crotalaria juncea), also called sann hemp or Indian hemp,  annual plant of the pea family (Fabaceae) and its fibre, one of the bast fibre group. Sunn is likely native to the Indian subcontinent, where it has been cultivated since prehistoric times. The sunn plant is not a true hemp. The fibre is made into cordage, fishing nets, sacking fabrics, canvas, and rug yarns and is used to manufacture such paper products as cigarette and tissue papers. The plant is also cultivated in many tropical countries as a green manure crop that is plowed under to fertilize soil.
Sunn is cultivated from seed and is densely sowed to limit lateral leaf growth. It grows best in loamy well-drained soil, but it is adaptable to poor soils and fairly arid climates and is often grown in rotation with such crops as rice, corn (maize), and cotton. The plants reach a height of about 2.5 to 3 metres (8 to 10 feet). The leaves are bright green in colour, pointed in form, and 5 to 7.5 cm (2 to 3 inches) in length. The small yellow flowers grow in spikelike clusters from the angle between the leafstalk and the plant stem (leaf axil). Fibre crops are either cut or pulled out when seedpods begin to form; green manure crops are plowed under when the plants begin to flower. Fibres are obtained by a retting operation followed by stripping, washing, and drying.
Sunn fibre is lustrous, with a whitish, gray, or yellow colour. The fibre strands, about 1 to 1.5 metres (3.3 to 5 feet) long, are composed of individual fibre cells, cylindrically shaped and with striated surface markings. Sunn fibre is almost as strong as hemp and more durable than jute. It increases in strength when wet and is fairly resistant to mildew.
