Fringe tree,  (genus Chionanthus), also spelled fringtree,  genus of about 150 species of flowering trees and shrubs in the oleander family (Oleaceae). They get their name from the long, fringy flowers that cover the trees in spring. The flowers hang in clusters of about the same length as the simple oval leaves and have four narrow petals. The dark blue fruits are oblong drupes.
At least two fringe trees are grown as ornamentals for their showy, fragrant, snow-white flowers. The white fringe tree (Chionanthus virginicus) from southeastern North America, reaches about 10 metres (33 feet) in height. The Chinese fringe tree (C. retusus) seldom reaches more than 6 metres (20 feet).
