Squirrel corn,  (Dicentra canadensis),  wildflower of eastern and midwestern North American woodlands, belonging to the poppy family (Papaveraceae). Squirrel corn is sometimes cultivated as a garden ornamental.
Squirrel corn is a herbaceous perennial that grows approximately 30 cm (1 foot) tall. The plant is a spring ephemeral, meaning it dies back after flowering in the springtime. Squirrel corn gets its common name from the nodulelike yellow tubers that cluster along the rootstock. The delicate compound leaves and small flower stalks arise basally from these tubers. The tremulous two-lobed flowers resemble those of the bleeding heart (Lamprocapnos spectabilis) and Dutchmanâ€™s breeches (Dicentra cucullaria), to which it is related. The flowers are usually white or cream-coloured and have slight fragrance.
