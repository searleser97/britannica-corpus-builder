Yucca,  (genus Yucca),  genus of about 40 species of succulent plants in the agave subfamily of the asparagus family (Asparagaceae), native to southern North America. Most species of yucca are stemless, with a rosette of stiff sword-shaped leaves at the base and clusters of waxy white flowers.
The Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) has a stem more than 10 metres (33 feet) high. Spanish bayonet (Y. aloifolia), Spanish dagger (Y. gloriosa), and Adamâ€™s needle (Y. filamentosa) are commonly cultivated as ornamentals for their unusual appearance and attractive flower clusters.
