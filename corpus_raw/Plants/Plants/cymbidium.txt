Cymbidium,  (genus Cymbidium), also called boat orchid,   genus of 50–70 species of tropical and subtropical orchids (family Orchidaceae). The genus is primarily distributed in Asia, though several species are native to northern Australia. The orchids are popular as florists’ plants and ornamentals, and there are several thousand horticultural hybrids. The plants are known for their showy flowers, which range from white and pale yellow to green, maroon, and dark bronze and can persist for several months. The cut flowers are also fairly long-lasting and are commonly used in corsages.
Cymbidium species are evergreen and grow in soil or epiphytically on other plants. Most have short pseudobulbs (bulblike stem bases), straplike leathery leaves, and many flowers on each flower stalk. The waxy petals and sepals are typically about the same size and the same colour, while the prominent labellum (lip) often features a contrasting colour. The flowers of some species are fragrant.
