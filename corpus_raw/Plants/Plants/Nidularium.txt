Nidularium,   genus of about 25 South American plants of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae) that grow upon the branches of trees. Several species are cultivated indoors as decorative plants for their handsome foliage and colourful red, purplish, or white flowers.
The best-known Nidularium is the blushing bromeliad (N. fulgens), not to be confused with Neoregelia carolinae, which is also commonly known as blushing bromeliad. Both it and Nidularium innocenti have white flowers surrounded by bright red bracts.
