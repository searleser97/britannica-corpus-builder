Bentgrass,  (genus Agrostis), also called bent,  genus of about 150â€“200 species of annual and perennial grasses in the family Poaceae. Bentgrasses are distributed in temperate and cool parts of the world and at high altitudes in subtropical and tropical areas; at least 40 species are found in North America. Some are grown as forage and turf plants, and a number are considered weeds and invasive species in areas outside their native range.
Bentgrasses are typically tufted and have slender stems and flat leaf blades. Many species have creeping stolons or rhizomes (horizontal subsurface stems) and can spread vegetatively. The flowers are open or dense clusters of small spikelets and are wind-pollinated.
Redtop (Agrostis gigantea), 1 to 1.5 metres (about 3 to 5 feet) tall, was introduced into North America during colonial times as a hay and pasture grass. It spreads by rhizomes and has reddish flowers. The smaller creeping bent (A. stolonifera), the stolons of which grow up to 1.2 metres (3.9 feet) per season, and Idaho bentgrass (A. idahoensis) are popular lawn grasses. Varieties of both species are planted in golf courses and bowling greens around the world; they are closely cut to develop a finely textured, spongy, firm turf.
