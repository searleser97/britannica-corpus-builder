jasmine,  (genus Jasminum), also spelled jessamine,  genus of about 200 species of fragrant-flowered shrubs and vines of the olive family (Oleaceae). The plants are native to tropical and to some temperate areas of the Old World. Several are cultivated as ornamentals.
Most true jasmines have climbing branches without tendrils. The white, yellow, or rarely pink flowers are tubular with a flaring, lobed, pinwheel-like form; some double-flowered varieties have been developed. The leaves can be evergreen or deciduous and usually are composed of two or more leaflets, although some species have simple leaves. The fruit in most species is a two-lobed black berry.
Common jasmine, or poetâ€™s jasmine (Jasminum officinale), native to Iran, produces fragrant white flowers that are the source of attar of jasmine used in perfumery. It is widely cultivated for its shining leaves and clusters of flowers that bloom in summer. Winter jasmine (J. nudiflorum), a Chinese species with solitary yellow flowers, is used as a cover plant on hillsides. Japanese, or primrose, jasmine (J. mesnyi) is a similar plant with larger flowers that bloom during the winter. Italian jasmine (J. humile), a vinelike shrub with yellow flowers, has many cultivated varieties. The fragrant dried flowers of Arabian jasmine (J. sambac) are used to make jasmine tea.
Many fragrant-flowered plants from other families are given the name jasmine, including the star, or Confederate, jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides), Cape jasmine (Gardenia jasminoides), Madagascar jasmine (Marsdenia floribunda), jasmine tobacco (Nicotiana alata), Carolina, or allspice, jasmine (Gelsemium sempervirens), Chilean jasmine (Mandevilla suaveolens), orange jasmine (various species of the genus Murraya), night or day jasmine (various species of Cestrum), and the crepe jasmine (Tabernaemontana divaricata).
