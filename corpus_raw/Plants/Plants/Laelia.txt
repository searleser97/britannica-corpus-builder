Laelia,  genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae), containing about 25 species of plants with attractively coloured flowers. The plants are found in semitropical and temperate areas of Central America and Mexico. Many species have been crossed with Cattleya and other genera to produce hybrid orchids for the commercial flower trade.
Most Laelia species are epiphytic; that is, they are supported by other plants and have aerial roots exposed to the humid atmosphere. The pseudobulbs (swollen stems) of various Laelia species may be long, oval, or rounded and usually produce one or two waxy leaves. The plants typically bloom in spring or autumn and produce racemes of up to eight flowers.
