Apiaceae, also called Umbelliferae,  the parsley family, in the order Apiales, comprising between 300 and 400 genera of plants distributed throughout a wide variety of habitats, principally in the north temperate regions of the world. Most members are aromatic herbs with alternate, feather-divided leaves that are sheathed at the base. The flowers are often arranged in a conspicuous umbel (a flat-topped cluster of flowers). Each small individual flower is usually bisexual, with five sepals, five petals, and an enlarged disk at the base of the style. The fruits are ridged and are composed of two parts that split open at maturity.
Many species of the Apiaceae are poisonous, including poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), water hemlock (Cicuta maculata), and foolâ€™s parsley (Aethusa cynapium). Other species, however, are widely used vegetables, including parsley (Petroselinum crispum), carrot (Daucus carota), celery (Apium graveolens), parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare). Species used as herbs and spices include anise (Pimpinella anisum), dill (Anethum graveolens), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), caraway (Carum carvi), and cumin (Cuminum cyminum). Several species have long been used as herbal and folk remedies; e.g., gum ammoniac (Dorema ammoniacum) and goutweed (Aegopodium podagraria). Some species are grown for their ornamental value; e.g., masterwort (Astrantia), blue lace flower (Trachymene caerulea), and sea holly (Eryngium maritimum).
