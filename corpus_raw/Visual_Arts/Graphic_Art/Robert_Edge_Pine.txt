Robert Edge Pine,  (born 1730, London, England—died November 18, 1788, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.), English artist who painted portraits of many of the Founding Fathers of the United States.
Little is known about Pine’s artistic education, but it is likely that his father, the engraver John Pine, instructed him in his youth. In 1760 his painting The Surrender of Calais won first prize for historical subjects in the first exhibition held by the Society of Arts in London, and three years later he received the same award for his Canute Rebuking His Courtiers on the Seashore. He became widely known as a painter of portraits, particularly those of contemporary theatrical personalities. His likenesses of David Garrick, painted during this period, are regarded as especially fine.
In 1782 Pine exhibited paintings depicting scenes and characters from William Shakespeare’s plays, and the following year or so he went to the United States, taking the exhibition with him and showing it in Philadelphia. He planned portraits of the leaders of the American Revolution, as well as historical scenes of the important events of the war itself. This plan was never fully realized, although he did complete portraits of a number of contemporary statesmen, including Francis Hopkinson, George Washington, Robert Morris, Benjamin Franklin, and John Jay. In 1784 Pine organized a show of his work in Philadelphia, publishing an accompanying descriptive text that is believed to have been the earliest exhibition catalog in the United States. His portrait of Washington later appeared as an engraving in Washington Irving’s Life of George Washington (1855–59). Many of Pine’s works went to the Columbian Museum in Boston and were destroyed when that institution burned in 1803.
