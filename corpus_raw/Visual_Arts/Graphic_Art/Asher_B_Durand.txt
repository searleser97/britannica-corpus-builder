Asher B. Durand, in full Asher Brown Durand,  (born August 21, 1796, Jefferson Village, New Jersey, U.S.—died September 17, 1886, Jefferson Village), American painter, engraver, and illustrator, one of the founders of the Hudson River school of landscape painting.
He was apprenticed in 1812 to an engraver. By 1823 his reputation was established with his engraving of John Trumbull’s painting Declaration of Independence. For the next decade he continued to do engraved reproductions of paintings by American artists (e.g., Ariadne by John Vanderlyn). He also illustrated gift books, or annuals, and engraved a popular series of 72 portraits of famous contemporary Americans.
With his brother Cyrus Durand (1787–1868), he formed a partnership for a banknote engraving company. Cyrus invented machines for the mechanical drawing of lines that revolutionized the art of currency engraving, while Asher’s graphic work for the Federal Bureau of Printing and Engraving was influential in establishing the design tradition and many of the pictorial and ornamental devices for U.S. paper currency.
After 1835 he devoted himself chiefly to portraiture, painting several U.S. presidents and other Americans of political and social prominence. In 1840–41 he visited Europe to study the work of the old masters. After his return, he painted Romantic landscapes of the Hudson River area, the Adirondack Mountains, and New England in a precise style. He was among the earliest Americans to work from nature out-of-doors. His best known work, Kindred Spirits (1849), shows two of his friends, landscape painter Thomas Cole and poet William Cullen Bryant, in a minutely realistic Catskill forest setting.
Durand was one of the founders of the National Academy of Design (1826) and was its president, 1845–61.
