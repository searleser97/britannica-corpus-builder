Miklós Barabás,  (born Feb. 10, 1810, Kézdimárkosfalva, Transylvania, Hung. [now Mărcuşa, Rom.] —died Feb. 12, 1898, Budapest), painter and printmaker whose name is associated with the birth of “romantic pictography” in Hungary and who was one of the most popular artists of his time.
In 1829 Barabás studied at the Academy of Arts in Vienna. For him the most important lessons were to be learned not in the classroom but in observing nature, from independent creative work, and through friendships with fellow painters. From 1831 to 1833 he lived in Bucharest, Rom., where he completed a number of genre paintings and portraits. In 1834–35 he traveled around Italy, painting landscapes. There he met and learned watercolour technique from the English painter W.L. Leitch. Barabás was also a prolific lithographer.
After his return to Hungary, Barabás achieved success with his portraits of the prominent figures of his day. His subjects included Emperor Francis Joseph, the composer Franz Liszt, the poet János Arany, the social and economic reformer István, Gróf (count) Széchenyi, and the writer-politician József, Báró (baron) Eötvös. Barabás was elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences at the age of 26, and in 1862 he became president of the Hungarian Fine Art Association.
