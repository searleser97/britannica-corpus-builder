Carlo Maratta, Maratta also spelled Maratti,  (born May 15, 1625, Camerano, Papal States [Italy]—died  Dec. 15, 1713, Rome), one of the leading painters of the Roman school in the later 17th century and one of the last great masters of Baroque classicism. His final works offer an early example of “arcadian good taste” (named for the Academy of Arcadians, of which he was a member), a style that was to dominate Roman art for the first half of the 18th century.
Maratta went early to Rome, where he studied. His reputation was established with his first public work, the Nativity (1650). A few years later he was noticed by Pope Alexander VII, and thereafter he secured an almost uninterrupted series of important commissions for altarpieces in Italian churches. Among these are The Mystery of the Trinity Revealed to St. Augustine (c. 1655), The Appearance of the Virgin to St. Philip Neri (c. 1675), and The Virgin with SS. Charles and Ignatius (c. 1685). His many popular depictions of the Virgin earned him the nickname Carluccio delle Madonne (“Little Carlo of the Madonnas”). He also executed a number of decorative ceiling frescoes in Roman palaces, the most important of which was for Pope Clement X in the Palazzo Altieri. Maratta painted with a clear and balanced composition that promotes papal clemency and Christian virtues. His critique of the style of Andrea Sacchi (1599–1661) places him securely in the classical camp of Roman Baroque painting. Maratta was one of the most distinguished portrait painters in Italy during this period, and his portraits include one of Pope Clement IX.
Maratta advocated classicism, at least in theory, in opposition to the Baroque painters Pietro da Cortona, Baciccio, and Padre Pozzo. But Maratta was only partly a classicist in practice. His work displays without restraint the Baroque quality of magnificence, and he was wholeheartedly engaged in the task of representing with the utmost splendour the dogmas of the Counter-Reformation.
