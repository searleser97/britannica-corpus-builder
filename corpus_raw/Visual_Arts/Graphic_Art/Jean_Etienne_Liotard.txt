Jean-Étienne Liotard,  (born Dec. 22, 1702, Geneva—died  June 12, 1789, Geneva), Swiss painter noted for his pastel portraits.
After studying in Paris, Liotard was taken to Naples by a patron and went to Rome in 1735 to paint the portraits of Pope Clement XII and several cardinals. In 1738 he accompanied another patron, Lord Duncannon, to Constantinople. He travelled to Vienna in 1743 to paint the portraits of Empress Maria Theresa and her family, earning the nickname of “the Turkish painter” by his eccentric adoption of Oriental costume. He visited England from 1753 to 1755 and painted portraits of the Princess of Wales and other notables. He went to Holland to work in 1756. On another visit to England begun in 1772, he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1773 and 1774, returning to Geneva in 1776, where he spent his final years. A versatile artist, in addition to his graceful and delicate pastel drawings he achieved distinction for his enamels, copperplate engravings, and glass painting. He wrote a Treatise on the Art of Painting and was himself an art collector.
