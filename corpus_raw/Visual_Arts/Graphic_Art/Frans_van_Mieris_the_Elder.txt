Frans van Mieris, the Elder,  (born April 16, 1635, Leiden, Netherlands—died March 12, 1681, Leiden), Dutch painter, son of Jan van Mieris and chief member of a family of Leiden painters.
Mieris took service with Abraham Toorenvliet, a glazier who kept a school of design. He then studied with Gerrit Dou and Abraham van den Tempel and acquired a manner that had more of the finish of the exquisites of the Leiden fijnischilders (“fine painters”) school than of the breadth of the disciples of Rembrandt. He seldom chose panels larger than 12–15 inches (30–38 cm) square. Characteristic of his art in its minute proportions is a shiny brightness and metallic polish. The subjects he treated best are those in which he illustrated the habits or actions of the wealthier classes, but he sometimes succeeded in homely incidents and in portraiture, and he occasionally ventured into allegory. His son Willem van Mieris (1662–1747) and his grandson Frans van Mieris the Younger (1689–1763) were also accomplished genre painters.
