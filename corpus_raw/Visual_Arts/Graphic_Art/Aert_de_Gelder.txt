Aert de Gelder, Aert also spelled Arent,  (born Oct. 26, 1645, Dordrecht, United Provinces [now the Netherlands]—died  Aug. 28, 1727, Dordrecht), the only Dutch artist of the late 17th and early 18th century to paint in the tradition of Rembrandt’s late style.
De Gelder spent his life in Dordrecht, except for a period of time about 1661 when he was Rembrandt’s pupil in Amsterdam. His biblical paintings—e.g., Scenes from the Passion (c. 1715)—feature warm colour and atmospheric light. In his portraits—e.g., The Family of Herman Boerhave (c. 1722)—his bold, broad manner of brushwork and surface texture contrasts markedly with the refined techniques and smoothly finished canvases of his contemporaries.
