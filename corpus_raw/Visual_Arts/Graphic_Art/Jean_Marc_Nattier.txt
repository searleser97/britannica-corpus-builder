Jean-Marc Nattier,  (born March 17, 1685, Paris, France—died November 7, 1766, Paris), French Rococo painter noted for his portraits of the ladies of King Louis XV’s court in classical mythological attire.
Nattier received his first instruction from his father, the portraitist Marc Nattier (c. 1642–1705), and from his uncle, the history painter Jean Jouvenet. He enrolled in the Royal Academy in 1703 and made a series of drawing of the Marie de Médicis painting cycle by Peter Paul Rubens in the Luxembourg Palace; the publication (1710) of engravings based on these drawings made Nattier famous. In 1715 he went to Amsterdam, where he painted portraits of the Russian tsar, Peter the Great, and his wife, Empress Catherine, though he declined the tsar’s offer to go to Russia.
Nattier aspired to be a history painter, but the French financial crisis of 1720 all but ruined him, and he was henceforth obliged to turn to portraiture, which was more lucrative. He subsequently revived the genre of the allegorical portrait, in which a living person is depicted as a Greco-Roman goddess or other mythological figure. Nattier’s graceful and charming portraits of court ladies in this mode were very fashionable, partly because he could beautify a sitter while also retaining her likeness. He served as official portraitist to the four daughters of Louis XV from 1745, painting those young ladies in innumerable guises and pursuits. Among Nattier’s portraits using a more straightforward approach are Portrait of Marie Leczinska and The Artist Surrounded by His Family (1730).
