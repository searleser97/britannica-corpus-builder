Nicolaes Maes, also spelled Nicolaas Maas,  (baptized January 1634, Dordrecht, Netherlands—died December 1693, Amsterdam), Dutch Baroque painter of genre and portraits who was a follower of Rembrandt.
In about 1650 Maes went to Amsterdam, where he studied with Rembrandt. Before his return to Dordrecht in 1654, Maes painted a few Rembrandtesque genre pictures as well as a biblical scene with life-size figures in deep glowing colours (Christ Blessing the Children, 1652–53; originally attributed to Rembrandt). In the period from 1655 to 1660, Maes devoted himself to domestic genre on a smaller scale, retaining to a great extent the use of colour he had learned from Rembrandt. His favourite subjects were women spinning or reading the Bible or preparing a meal. He visited Antwerp between 1660 and 1670, after which he devoted himself almost exclusively to portraiture, abandoning intimacy and glowing colour harmonies for a careless elegance that suggests the influence of van Dyck. The change gave rise to a theory of the existence of another Maes, of Brussels.
