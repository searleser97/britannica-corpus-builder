Joseph Pickett,  (born 1848, New Hope, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died 1918, New Hope), American folk painter known for his primitive depictions of town and landscape around his native New Hope, Pennsylvania.
After a life spent as a carpenter, shipbuilder, carny, and storekeeper, Pickett began painting when he was about 65. Pickett’s work exemplifies his detailed interest in local landscape and history, executed with a disregard for perspective but with a solid sense of colour and flat-pattern design (e.g., Manchester Valley [c. 1914–18]). Pickett’s works were not discovered by art critics or the public until the 1930s.
