Abū al-Ḥasan,  (flourished 17th century, Delhi [India]), one of the leading Mughal painters of the emperor Jahāngīr’s atelier, honoured by the emperor with the title Nādir al-Zamān (“Wonder of the Age”).
Abū al-Ḥasan was the son of Āqā Rezā of Herāt, who worked with Jahāngīr (reigned 1605–27) before his accession to the throne. Abū al-Ḥasan was trained in painting under the careful tutelage of the emperor, who praised him as having “no rival or equal” and took pride in having personally formed him at his court. Paintings of Abū al-Ḥasan’s that have survived include the famous chinar tree with squirrels, in the India Office Library, and a large number of superb portraits. His study of European prints may have reinforced his naturalism and sympathy for his subjects. He is known to have worked early in the reign of Shah Jahān (1628–1657/58).
