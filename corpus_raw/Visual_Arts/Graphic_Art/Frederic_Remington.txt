Frederic Remington, in full Frederic Sackrider Remington,  (born October 4, 1861, Canton, New York, U.S.—died December 26, 1909, near Ridgefield, Connecticut), American painter, illustrator, and sculptor noted for his realistic portrayals of life in the American West.
Remington studied art at Yale University (1878–80) and briefly (1886) at the Art Students League of New York. Thereafter he devoted himself primarily to illustrative work. In the years between his schooling, he traveled widely, spending much time west of the Mississippi River, and he made a specialty of depicting Native Americans, cowboys, soldiers, horses, and other aspects of life on the plains. On those trips he sketched and photographed continuously, amassing material to take back to and work from in his studio in New York City.
During the 1880s and ’90s many of Remington’s illustrations were printed in such popular magazines as Harper’s Weekly and Scribner’s Magazine. He also published a number of books and articles that served mainly as vehicles for his illustrations. During the Spanish-American War he was a war correspondent and artist. Remington was primarily a reporter, recording the image of the thing seen; his work is notable for its rendering of swift action and its accuracy of detail. In 1895 he created The Broncho Buster, the first of his well-known bronze sculptures. The Remington Art Museum in Ogdensburg, New York, contains an important collection of his paintings, illustrations, and bronze statuettes.
