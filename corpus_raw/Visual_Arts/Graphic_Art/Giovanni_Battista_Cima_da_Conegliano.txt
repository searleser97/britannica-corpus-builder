Giovanni Battista Cima da Conegliano,  (born c. 1459/60, Conegliano, near Venice [Italy]—died 1517/18, Conegliano), Italian painter of the Venetian school whose style was marked by its use of landscape and by airy, luminous colour. Probably a pupil of Bartolomeo Montagna, a minor painter of Vicenza, he was later influenced by the poetic and colouristically sensitive style of Giovanni Bellini, the great Venetian master of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Cima’s fully developed style is evident in his earliest dated picture, an altarpiece done in 1489. In 1492 Cima settled in Venice and in that year was commissioned to paint an altarpiece for the cathedral of Conegliano. According to contemporary records he was still in Venice in 1516 but must have returned to Conegliano shortly thereafter. Throughout his life Cima kept strong ties with his hometown, purchasing property there and maintaining a house to which he returned often from Venice.
