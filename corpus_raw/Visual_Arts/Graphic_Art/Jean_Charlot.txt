Jean Charlot,  (born February 7, 1898, Paris, France—died March 20, 1979, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.), French-born muralist, painter, and book illustrator who was known for monumental frescoes that show the influence of Mayan art.
Charlot, whose mother was of Mexican descent, moved to Mexico City in 1920. There he painted frescoes for the Mexican government with artists such as Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco. From 1926 to 1929 Charlot was the staff artist for a Carnegie Institute archaeological expedition in the Yucatán. Moving to the United States in 1929, he taught at many schools—including the Art Students League in New York City, the University of Georgia, and the University of Hawaii—until 1966.
Charlot’s fascination with Mayan art is evident in his bold use of colour and in his reduction of living figures into such elemental geometric shapes as circles, cubes, and cylinders. His works often deal with mythical and religious themes. Of more than 40 murals by Charlot, most notable are his frescoes. In Mexico City he painted Fall of Tenochtitlán (1922) at the National Preparatory School and two panels, The Washerwomen and The Pack Carriers (1923), at the Ministry of Education Building. Frescoes at the University of Georgia include a three-panel work on the arts (1941–42) and two panels at the Commerce-Journalism Building, Anno DMI 1519 Emperor Montezuma’s Scouts Cover America’s First Scoop and Anno DMI 1944 Press and Cameramen Flash on the Spot News, World War II (1943–44).
Charlot also painted on canvas, sculpted, wrote about art, and illustrated many books for adults and children. Of the books he authored, The Temple of the Warriors at Chichen Itzá, Yucatan (1931; with E.H. and A.A. Morris) and Mexican Mural Renaissance, 1920–1925 (1963) address the major influences on his art.
