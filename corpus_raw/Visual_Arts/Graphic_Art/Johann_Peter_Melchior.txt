Johann Peter Melchior,  (born Oct. 12, 1742, Lindorf, near Düsseldorf, Berg—died  June 13, 1825, Nymphenburg, Bavaria), modeller in porcelain, best known of the artists associated with the great German porcelain factory at Höchst. As a child he showed an interest in drawing, painting, and sculpture, and a relative apprenticed him to a sculptor in Düsseldorf. He became sufficiently well known to be named Modellmeister at the Höchst factory, a position he held from 1767 to 1779.
Melchior’s best work is considered to be transitional between the Rococo and Neoclassical styles. His graceful and often sentimental works include religious groups, pastoral scenes, and characters from mythology, but he is particularly noted for his warmly animated figures of children. He later worked at the porcelain factories at Frankenthal (1779–93) and Nymphenburg (1797–1822), where his style became increasingly Neoclassical and less sentimental; his chief interest was portrait reliefs, which he executed in biscuit (marble-like, unglazed) porcelain.
