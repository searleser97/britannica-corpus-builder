Tove Jansson, in full Tove Marika Jansson,  (born August 9, 1914, Helsinki, Finland, Russian Empire—died June 27, 2001, Helsinki, Finland), Finnish artist and writer-illustrator of children’s books (in Swedish). In her books she created the fantastic self-contained world of Moomintrolls, popular especially in northern and central Europe, although translations in more than 30 languages have provided a worldwide audience.
Jansson was the daughter of artists, and her illustrations began appearing in children’s magazines when she was a teenager. She studied painting in Stockholm, had her first exhibition in 1943, and worked for a time as a children’s book illustrator. In Småtrollen och den stora översvämningen (1945; “The Moomins and the Great Flood”) she introduced her hippopotamus-like creatures. The work was praised for its individualistic characters, complicated plots, and sophisticated humour, and eight other Moomin books followed. Jansson also created the comic strip “Moomin,” which ran in the Evening News in London from 1953 to 1960. She won the Stockholm Award for best children’s books in 1952, the Selma Lagerlöf Medal in 1953, the International Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 1966, and many other honours. Jansson also wrote an autobiography, Bild-huggarens dotter (1968; Sculptor’s Daughter), short stories, plays, and adult fiction.
