Hugo Erfurth,  (born October 14, 1874, Halle, Brandenburg [Germany]—died February 14, 1948, Gaienhofen, Germany), German photographer noted mainly for his portraits of artists, intellectuals, and celebrities of the 1920s.
Erfurth studied art at the Academy of Arts in Dresden, Germany, from 1892 to 1896. He worked as a portrait photographer in Dresden from 1896 until about 1925. Many artists, including Oskar Kokoschka, Otto Dix, and Paul Klee, frequented his studio and had their portraits taken. From 1924 to 1948 he was chairman of the jury of the prestigious Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner (GDL), an organization of leading German art photographers. He worked in Cologne, Germany, from 1934 to 1943 and in Gaienhofen from 1943 until his death.
Erfurth’s work is characterized by a simple, natural use of light, great psychological insight into the character of each of his subjects, and a masterful use of the technique of oil-pigment printing. As early as 1927, he also began to produce photograms (shadowlike photographs made by placing an object between a light source and light-sensitive paper) as well as industrial images. Much of his extensive nonportrait work was destroyed during World War II.
