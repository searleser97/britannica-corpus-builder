William Heath Robinson,  (born May 31, 1872, London, Eng.—died  Sept. 13, 1944, London), British cartoonist, book illustrator, and designer of theatrical scenery, who was best known for his cartoons that featured fantastic machinery.
In 1887 Robinson went to Islington School of Art and later briefly attended the Royal Academy schools, London. He illustrated a Don Quixote and an Arabian Nights, both in 1899, and in 1900 he illustrated an edition of the poems of Edgar Allan Poe. He continued book illustration and also did some advertising work, but his chief fame rests on his humorous drawings, which first appeared in The Sketch and later in The Bystander, The Strand Magazine, The Illustrated London News, and other English and American publications. Before World War I he had achieved a worldwide reputation. His drawings are particularly notable for the fun he made of machinery. A ludicrously impractical or elaborate machine came to be called “a Heath Robinson contraption.” Absurdities (1934) is a collection of his drawings. His autobiography is My Line of Work (1938).
