José Guadalupe Posada,  (born Feb. 2, 1851, Aguascalientes, Mex.—died Jan. 20, 1913, Mexico City), printmaker whose works, often expressionistic in content and style, were influential in the development of 20th-century graphic art.
As a child, Posada worked as a farm labourer and in a pottery factory. He taught school for a short time and then began to draw, inspired largely by posters for the Rea Circus. Gradually he was attracted to printmaking. He became a kind of pictorial journalist with the publication of thousands of broadside illustrations and popular book and song covers. He is perhaps best known for his animated skeletons (calaveras). Most of his works were engraved or etched in relief on type metal. A museum dedicated to his work is located in Aguascalientes.
