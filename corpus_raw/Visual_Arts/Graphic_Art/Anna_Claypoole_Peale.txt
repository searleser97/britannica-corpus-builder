Anna Claypoole Peale ,  (born March 6, 1791, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died Dec. 25, 1878, Philadelphia), American painter of portrait miniatures who was among the country’s few professional women artists in the early 19th century.
Anna was the daughter of Mary Chambers Claypoole Peale and James Peale, a painter of portrait miniatures on ivory and of portraits and still lifes on canvas. His studio served as a classroom and studio for Anna and her sisters Sarah Miriam (1800–85) and Margaretta (1795–1829). Anna’s uncle Charles Willson Peale was a well-known portraitist and founder of one of the country’s first natural history museums, what is now known as Peale’s Museum in Philadelphia. Anna’s enterprise was evident by age 14, when she sold at auction two oil copies of paintings by French artist Joseph Vernet. A few years later she began to accept independent commissions. In 1818–19 she accompanied her uncle Charles to Washington, D.C., on a painting trip. There Anna made portrait miniatures of several prominent statesmen of the new republic, including James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and William Bainbridge. In 1824 she and Sarah were elected academicians of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia.
Anna married the Rev. William Staughton in 1829 but was a widow within a few brief months. She retired from painting in 1841 following her second marriage, to Gen. William Duncan.
