Jacob Gerritsz. Cuyp, in full Jacob Gerritszoon Cuyp, Cuyp also spelled Cuijp,  (born December 1594, Dordrecht, the Netherlands—died 1652,  Dordrecht), Dutch Baroque painter, best known for his portraits. He broke with the family tradition of glass painting and painted historical pictures, portraits, and animal subjects.
A man of substance in Dordrecht, he held various offices in the painters’ guild there. He probably studied under Abraham Bloemaert of Utrecht, a painter of portraits and histories. Little else is known of his life.
Cuyp’s portraits are soundly painted, sure in draftsmanship, and firm in modeling. Though they lack the vitality of a Frans Hals or the insight into character of a Rembrandt, they are imbued with that honesty and integrity that, allied to technical competence, are characteristic of the best tradition of Dutch 17th-century portraiture. Besides many simple bust or half-length portraits on a monochrome background, he painted some full-lengths, including several pleasing portraits of children, and some more ambitiously designed group portraits, with interior or landscape backgrounds. As a painter of animal subjects and landscapes, Jacob exerted a powerful influence on his more famous son, Aelbert, for there is a degree of atmosphere and luminosity in his work unusual among the painters of his generation. He also influenced the landscapes and genre paintings of his nephew and student, Benjamin Gerritsz. Cuyp (1612–52).
