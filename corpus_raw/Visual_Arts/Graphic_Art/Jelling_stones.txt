Jelling stones,   two 10th-century royal gravestones found in Jutland, best known of all Danish runic inscriptions. The earlier stone, a memorial honouring Queen Thyre, was commissioned by her husband, King Gorm the Old, last pagan king of Denmark. The other, erected in memory of his parents by Harald Bluetooth, son of Gorm and Thyre, ruler of Denmark and Norway, and Christianizer of Denmark, is a three-sided pyramid, two sides bearing pictures and the third, an inscription. Its carvings depict ornamental animal forms, sophisticated interlacing linear patterns, and a Christian theme (the Crucifixion).
