Rube Goldberg, byname of Reuben Lucius Goldberg,  (born July 4, 1883, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died December 7, 1970, New York, New York), American cartoonist who satirized the American preoccupation with technology. His name became synonymous with any simple process made outlandishly complicated.
Rube Goldberg was born the son of a San Francisco police and fire commissioner, who guided him into engineering at the University of California. He received a B.S. in 1904 and took a job designing sewer pipes for the San Francisco Sewer Department.
After a few months, however, he left to become a sportswriter and cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle (1904–05) and later for the San Francisco Bulletin (1905–07). He went east and joined the New York Evening Mail (1907–21), where he created three long-running comic strips. He also created the cartoon character Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, an inventor of contraptions that accomplished simple ends in a roundabout manner. One of his hundreds of inventions was an automatic stamp licker activated by a dwarf robot who overturned a can of ants onto a page of postage stamps, gum side up. They were then licked up by an anteater who had been starved for three days.
In 1938 Goldberg turned to editorial cartooning, working successively for The New York Sun, The New York Journal, and The Journal-American. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1948 for the best editorial cartoon, his “Peace Today,” a warning against atomic weapons. When he retired from cartooning in 1964, he achieved critical recognition for his sculpture in bronze and his cartoons in clay.
