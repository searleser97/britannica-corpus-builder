Hiram Powers,  (born June 29, 1805, Woodstock, Vermont, U.S.—died June 27, 1873, Florence, Italy), American sculptor who worked in the Neoclassical style during the mid-1800s. He is best remembered for his Greek Slave (1843), a white marble statue of a nude girl in chains.
Powers first studied with Frederick Eckstein about 1828. About 1829 he worked as a general assistant and artist in a wax museum in Cincinnati, Ohio, where his ingenious representations of scenes from Dante’s Inferno met with acclaim. At the end of 1834 Powers went to Washington, D.C., where he modeled a portrait of Andrew Jackson (1835). The attention he received for this work led to other portrait commissions from local residents, bringing Powers newfound financial security. He traveled to Italy in 1835 and in 1837, after residing in Paris for a few months, settled permanently in Florence, where he befriended the American sculptor Horatio Greenough, whom he represented in an 1838 marble portrait bust.
In 1843 Powers created the Greek Slave, which caused an international sensation when exhibited at the Crystal Palace (for the Great Exhibition of 1851) in London and later at the New York Crystal Palace in 1853. The popularity of this statue, of which six replicas were made, established his reputation as one of the most popular sculptors of his time. An entrepreneur, Powers turned the success of the Greek Slave and other female full-length subjects into a lucrative venture by carving more-attainable bust-sized versions of them. An artist of amazing technical ability, he commanded high prices for his work. He produced many portrait busts of prominent American visitors to his large and popular studio in Florence.
