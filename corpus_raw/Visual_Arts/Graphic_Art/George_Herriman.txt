George Herriman,  (born August 20, 1880, New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.—died April 25, 1944, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California), American cartoonist who created Krazy Kat, a comic strip whose originality in terms of fantasy, drawing, and dialogue was of such high order that many consider it the finest strip ever produced.
Herriman turned to cartooning after a fall from a scaffold made it difficult for him to work as a house painter. His first comic strip, Lariat Pete, appeared in 1903 in the San Francisco Chronicle. In the next few years he created a number of short-lived strips, from which Krazy Kat evolved in 1910. For more than 30 years, the strip appeared in the papers in the chain belonging to William Randolph Hearst.
Krazy Kat was unique in a number of ways. The cast of characters was small and the basic plot always the same: Krazy Kat loved Ignatz Mouse, but the malicious Ignatz would have none of it and took every opportunity to throw a brick at Krazy. The policeman Offissa Pupp tried to protect Krazy, often by putting Ignatz in jail. The three principals were perpetually oblivious to each other’s actual feelings: the joyous Krazy misinterpreted Ignatz’s brick-throwing as a way of expressing love; Ignatz mistakenly thought that his bricks injured Krazy; and Offissa Pupp sought to curry Krazy’s affections by imprisoning Ignatz. The strip utilized poetic dialogue, and its landscape backgrounds were stark and surrealistic, based on the Arizona desert. From these simple elements Herriman constructed an astonishing number of variations.
During the 1920s the strip attained wide popularity, particularly among intellectuals. It was highly praised by the influential critic Gilbert Seldes in The Seven Lively Arts (1924). About 1922 Herriman moved from New York City to Hollywood, where he was living at the time of his death. In recognition of his original touch, the strip was allowed to die with its creator.
