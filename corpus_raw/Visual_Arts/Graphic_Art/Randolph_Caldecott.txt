Randolph Caldecott,  (born March 22, 1846, Chester, Cheshire, Eng.—died  Feb. 12, 1886, St. Augustine, Fla., U.S.), English artist chiefly known for the gently satirical drawings and coloured book illustrations that won him great popularity.
While a bank clerk at Whitchurch, Shropshire, and at Manchester, Caldecott began drawing for local magazines. Through his acquaintance with George Du Maurier he began contributing to the periodical London Society in 1871; the next year he settled in London and turned professional, ultimately drawing for Punch and Graphic, among other periodicals. He increased his skill by painting under Sir Edward Poynter and by sketching and modelling in the studio of J. Dalou.
In 1872 he went with his lifelong friend Henry Blackburn to Germany. His drawings for Blackburn’s book, The Harz Mountains, fix Caldecott’s style in the tradition of Richard Doyle—moderate in distortion and affably satirical. He also illustrated Washington Irving’s Sketch Book (1875) and Bracebridge Hall (1876). These more sophisticated drawings were close to those of Du Maurier and W.P. Frith, though with an original sense of caricature, and they established Caldecott’s reputation. His coloured picture books for children included W. Cowper’s John Gilpin (1878), Oliver Goldsmith’s Elegy on a Mad Dog (1879) and The Great Panjandrum Himself (1885). His works in other media include paintings, metal reliefs, and terra-cottas.
