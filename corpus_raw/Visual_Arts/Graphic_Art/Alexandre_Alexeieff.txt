Alexandre Alexeïeff, Russian name in full Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Alekseyev,  (born August 5, 1901, Kazan, Russia—died  August 9, 1982, Paris, France), Russian-born French filmmaker who invented the pinscreen method of animation with his collaborator (later his wife), the animator Claire Parker (1910–81).
Alexeïeff spent his childhood near Istanbul and studied at a naval college in St. Petersburg. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 he studied painting and worked at the Chauve-Souris Theatre in Paris, where he designed sets and costumes for the Ballets Russes and Ballets Suédois. In his desire to create a unique artistic medium, Alexeïeff conceived the pinscreen, a rectangular white screen into which hundreds of thousands of headless pins are inserted. By retracting or pushing out groups of pins and adjusting light sources, Alexeïeff discovered that all possible shades of gray could be achieved and that the resulting three-dimensional shapes created the effect of an animated engraving. The process is extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming; Canadian filmmaker Jacques Drouin (b. 1943) is the only animator other than Alexeïeff to have mastered the medium.
The first film that Alexeïeff and Parker made using the pinscreen was Une Nuit sur le mont chauve (1933; A Night on Bald Mountain). Their other pinscreen productions included La Belle au bois dormant (1934; Sleeping Beauty), Parade de chapeaux (1935; “Parade of Hats”), En passant (1943; Passing By), Le Nez (1963; The Nose), and the titles to Orson Welles’s Le Procès (1962; The Trial).
During the early 1950s Alexeïeff made greatly admired commercials by using slow-exposure photography on swinging pendulums to which light sources were attached. He also made experimental and theatrical cartoons and illustrated books, using both wood engravings and still photographs of pinscreens.
