Yi Sang-chwa, also called Hakp’o (Korean: “Study Garden”),  (flourished 16th century, Korea), noted Korean painter famous for the freshness and originality of his style.
Yi was originally a slave in a scholar’s household, but his great artistic talents soon came to the attention of the king, and he was admitted to the Korean Royal Academy. He is known for his landscapes as well as for his portraits of the royal family. He also painted portraits of meritorious subjects, and for this work he himself was awarded the status of minor meritorious subject. The landscape painting now attributed to him shows the distinct influence of the Ma-Xia school landscape style and indicates the vogue for that school during the early Chosŏn.
