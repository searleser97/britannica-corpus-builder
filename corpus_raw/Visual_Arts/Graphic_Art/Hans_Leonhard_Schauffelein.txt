Hans Leonhard Schäuffelein, also spelled Léonard Schäuffelin, Schauffele, Scheifelin, Schenfelein, Schenflein, orSchoyffelin,  (born c. 1480, Nürnberg—died c. 1539, Nördlingen, Holy Roman Empire), German painter and designer of woodcuts whose work bears the strong influence of Albrecht Dürer. An altarpiece for the Church of Ober-Sankt-Veit, near Vienna, believed to be his first work, was drawn by Dürer.
In 1509 Schäuffelein worked in the Tirol and later in Bavaria. There he painted the altarpiece for the Benedictine abbey in Auhausen and was one of a group of artists in the service of Maximilian I. An accomplished graphic designer, Schäuffelein executed copperplate engravings and illustrated the Theuerdank (c. 1514) with woodcuts for Maximilian. He opened a workshop in Nördlingen in 1514, and thereafter he devoted the greater part of his time to painting. Though never viewed by critics as an outstanding draftsman, Schäuffelein demonstrated in his later works his talent as a portraitist. His most important work during this period includes the mural cycle depicting the “Story of Judith” for the town hall of Nördlingen.
