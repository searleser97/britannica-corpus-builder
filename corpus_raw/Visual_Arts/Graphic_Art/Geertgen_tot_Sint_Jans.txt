Geertgen tot Sint Jans,  (flourished c. 1475–95), North Netherlandish painter of religious subjects, notable for his harmonious fusion of the elements of the landscape.
Little is known of Geertgen’s life: his surname derived from his living with the religious order of the Knights of St. John at Haarlem (now in the Netherlands), where he was a pupil of the painter Albert van Ouwater. Many of his works have been destroyed, but portions of his masterpiece, a large triptych for the high altar of the Knights of St. John, survive. One wing, The Burning of the Bones of St. John the Baptist, presages the great portrait groups painted by Rembrandt and Frans Hals in the 17th-century.
Several other paintings are ascribed to Geertgen on stylistic grounds, such as St. John the Baptist in the Wilderness, Virgin and Child, The Resurrection of Lazarus, The Virgin’s Kindred, Adoration of the Magi, and The Man of Sorrows. The Nativity at Night by Geertgen is remarkable for its rendering of chiaroscuro.
