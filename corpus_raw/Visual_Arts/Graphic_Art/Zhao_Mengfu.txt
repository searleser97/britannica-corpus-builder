Zhao Mengfu, Wade-Giles romanization Chao Meng-fu, courtesy name (zi) Zi’ang,  (born 1254, Huzhou [now Wuxing], Zhejiang province, China—died 1322), Chinese painter and calligrapher who, though occasionally condemned for having served in the foreign Mongol court (Yuan dynasty, 1206–1368), has been honoured as an early master within the tradition of the literati painters (wenrenhua), who sought personal expression rather than the representation of nature.
Though he was a descendant of the imperial family of the Song dynasty (960–1279) and had been educated in the imperial university, in 1286, Zhao accepted service in the newly established Mongol court. His paintings were among the first after the collapse of the Song dynasty and its academy of painting to show an interest derived from subjects and styles of ancient masters. Zhao is popularly remembered as a painter of horses in the manner of the Tang dynasty (618–907) master Han Gan, but he also painted other animal groups, landscapes, and bamboos. Referring to the antique, he generally avoided superficial beauty by utilizing deliberately simplified colour and compositions and a schematic, even childlike, rendering of forms and scale. His works often display a great variety of brushwork. Zhao’s wife, Guan Daosheng, and his son, Zhao Yong (born 1289), were both painters of note.
