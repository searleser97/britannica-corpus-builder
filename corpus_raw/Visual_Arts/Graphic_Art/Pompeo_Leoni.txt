Pompeo Leoni,  (born 1533, Milan [Italy]—died October 13, 1608, Madrid, Spain), Italian late Renaissance sculptor and medalist who, like his father, Leone, was known for his expressive sculpture portraits.
In 1556 Pompeo went to Spain to help his father. He produced a large-scale sculpture for the wedding of King Philip II and Anna of Austria in 1570. Also in that year, under the patronage of Philip II, he produced his most famous work, the bronze effigy portraits of the Holy Roman emperors Charles V and Philip II and their families, which now stand on either side of the main altar of the church of the monastic palace at El Escorial.
Leoni was appointed to serve the regent, Joan of Austria, and made Madrid his home. From 1576 to 1587 he worked on the tomb of Fernando de Valdés, archbishop of Sevilla (Seville) and inquisitor general, which has life-size marble figures. The Spanish influence on Leoni’s work is evident in his use of jewels.
