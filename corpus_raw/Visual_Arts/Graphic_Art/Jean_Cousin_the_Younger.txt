Jean Cousin, the Younger,  (born 1522, Sens, Fr.—died  1594, Paris), artist and craftsman noted for his painting, engraving, stained glass, sculpture, and book illustration, who, like his father, achieved fame for his versatility and independent style.
Cousin followed his father, Jean Cousin, to Paris and became a student in his studio, which he took over when his father died in 1560/61. Early in his career in Paris he achieved the title of master painter. Occasionally he left Paris to work in other locations: he journeyed to Sens in 1563 to consult on the preparations for the entrance of Charles IX, and he painted a series of portraits of his family there. Also in 1563 Cousin decorated the window and sculptures of the chapel of the Château de Fleurigny. From 1565 to 1572 he worked on a funeral monument for Admiral Chabot; there is some controversy surrounding Cousin’s exact contribution to the piece, though it is now believed he made the ornamental border.
Cousin’s style generally remained faithful to his father’s, so it is difficult to distinguish many of their works, which are undated. Jean Cousin’s most important surviving work is the “Last Judgment,” now in the Louvre, the theme of which is the insignificance of human life; the composition suggests both Florentine Mannerism and Flemish influences. Cousin also is noted for his drawing style, best represented in the emblematic style of his “Livre de Fortune” (1568). His other noted works include his engraving “Moses Showing the Serpent to the People,” his stained glass “Judgment of Solomon” (1586), and his illustrations for Ovid’s Metamorphosis.
