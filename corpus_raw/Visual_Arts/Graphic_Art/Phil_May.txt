Phil May, byname of Philip William May,  (born April 22, 1864, Wortley, near Leeds, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  Aug. 5, 1903, London), British social and political caricaturist whose most popular works deal with lower- and middle-class London life in the late Victorian period.
His father, an engineer, died when May was nine years old. Three years later he began to earn his living; he worked as a timekeeper in a foundry, as a jockey, and then on the stage. When he was 16 he went to London, finally obtaining work as a designer with a theatrical costumer. He also drew posters and cartoons and for about two years worked for St. Stephen’s Review. After a period in Australia, where he worked for the Sydney Bulletin, he returned to London in 1892 and resumed his work for St. Stephen’s Review. May’s studies of the London “guttersnipe” and the coster girl rapidly made him famous. His overflowing sense of fun, his sympathy with his subjects, and his kindly wit were on a par with his artistic ability. The economy of line characteristic of his drawings was the result of a laborious process in which he made numerous preliminary sketches. His later work included some excellent political portraits. He became a member of the staff of Punch in 1896, and from then on his services were retained entirely for that magazine and for the Graphic.
