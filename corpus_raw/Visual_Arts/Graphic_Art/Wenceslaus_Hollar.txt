Wenceslaus Hollar, Bohemian Vaclav Hollar, Wenceslaus also given as Wenzel,  (born July 23, 1607, Prague—died  March 25, 1677, London), Bohemian etcher whose works are a rich source of information about the 17th century.
Hollar went to Frankfurt in 1627 where he studied under the engraver and publisher Matthäus Merian, later moving to Strasbourg, and then to Cologne in 1633. There he attracted the attention of the collector Thomas, earl of Arundel, with whom he was associated for most of his life. Hollar settled in England in 1637, but moved to Antwerp in about 1644, and returned to London in 1652.
He was a master etcher, and his work is still much appreciated by connoisseurs. He illustrated a number of books and produced the celebrated Views of London after the Great Fire of 1666. Some 3,000 plates are credited to him. He died in extreme poverty.
