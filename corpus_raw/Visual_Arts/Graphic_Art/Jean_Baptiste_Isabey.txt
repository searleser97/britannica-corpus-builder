Jean-Baptiste Isabey,  (born April 11, 1767, Nancy, France—died April 18, 1855, Paris), gifted French painter and printmaker, specializing in portraits and miniatures. He enjoyed official favour from the time of Louis XVI until his death. His portrait Napoleon at Malmaison (1802) is considered one of the best likenesses of the emperor.
Isabey studied under, among others, the celebrated French Neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David and received one of his first commissions from Marie-Antoinette, Louis XVI’s consort. Despite his original connections with the monarchy, Isabey created 228 portraits of deputies for a work on the Legislative Assembly during the Revolution. Patronized by Napoleon and Joséphine, he arranged the ceremonies of their coronation and prepared 32 drawings, intended as an official commemoration of the event. He had an immense success at the Salon of 1820 with Isabey’s Boat, a drawing of himself and his family. During the reign of King Louis-Philippe (1830–48), he directed the artists’ studio at the Sèvres porcelain factory. Less known than the portraits are Isabey’s caricatures of many famous European politicians of the first half of the 19th century. Though most of these remained unpublished, they were known to many artists of the time. The genre painter Eugène Isabey (1804–86) was his son and student.
