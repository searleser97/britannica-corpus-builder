Wen Zhengming, Wade-Giles romanization Wen Cheng-ming, original name Wen Bi,  (born 1470, Suzhou, Jiangsu province, China—died 1559), Chinese painter, calligrapher, and scholarly figure who was a student of Shen Zhou; these two artists are considered the leading figures of the Wu school of scholar-artists in China.
Born to an established family, Wen Zhengming was brought up in a strongly Confucian home, and he met many of the learned people of his time. He was by nature sensitive and withdrawn, and it was not until age 53 that he emerged from his scholarly isolation, receiving the recognition of the court with his appointment to the Hanlin Academy. He stayed there for only three years and then retired to produce his best-known works.
Wen Zhengming was expert at the four major styles of calligraphy: seal, official, regular, and “running.” He was also known as a collector and connoisseur, especially of calligraphy. In painting he admired the great literati of the Yuan dynasty (1206–1368) as well as earlier artists from the Song (960–1279) and Five Dynasties (907–960) periods. He followed no single style, but in all his paintings there is a spirit of studied antiquarianism and cautious consideration. In technique his paintings range from the highly detailed to the more freely washed. His students included his son, Wen Jia, and his nephew, Wen Boren.
