Isabel Bishop,  (born March 3, 1902, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—died February 19, 1988, New York, New York), American painter, draughtsman, and etcher who worked in an urban realist style.
Isabel Bishop was reared in Detroit, Michigan. She moved to New York City at age 16 to study commercial art, attending the New York School of Design for Women in 1918. She shifted from commercial drawing to painting in 1920, enrolling at the Art Students League. While there, she studied with the Cubist painter Max Weber; soon afterward she studied with Kenneth Hayes Miller, a member of the urban-inspired Ashcan School. During this period, she developed a realist technique as well as an approach to light and shadow reminiscent of that of Peter Paul Rubens. By 1928 she was working on her own, establishing a reputation as an urban realist. Two years later Bishop assured her reputation with her first show, held at the Dudensing Gallery in New York.
Bishop often depicted moving figures and crowds in New York’s Union Square, which the studio that she leased from 1934 to 1978 overlooked. She is best known for her paintings and drawings of working women, hoboes, and students. Also an accomplished draughtsman, she often produced etchings based on her paintings. Her body of work illustrated the changing face of Union Square from the post-Depression milieu of the 1930s to the war protesters and students of the 1960s and ’70s.
Bishop married neurologist Harold Wolff in 1934 and gave birth to a son in 1940. She began teaching at the Art Students League in 1935 and became the first female full-time member of the staff in 1937. In 1946 she became the first female officer (vice president) of the National Institution of Arts and Letters. At age 72 Bishop had her first retrospective show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.
