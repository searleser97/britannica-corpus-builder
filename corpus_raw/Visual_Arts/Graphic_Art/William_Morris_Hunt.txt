William Morris Hunt,  (born March 31, 1824, Brattleboro, Vermont, U.S.—died September 8, 1879, Isles of Shoals, New Hampshire), Romantic painter who created a fashion in the United States for the luminous, atmospheric painting of the French Barbizon school.
After attending Harvard University, Hunt studied with Thomas Couture in Paris and then in Barbizon with Jean-François Millet, one of the leaders of the Barbizon school of painters. Upon returning to New England, Hunt introduced the works of Camille Corot, Théodore Rousseau, and the Barbizon school to the Boston society circles in which he moved, thereby helping to turn a rising generation of American painters toward Paris and away from the national style epitomized by the Hudson River school landscape painters.
After 1855 he painted some of his best pictures, reminiscent of his life in France and of the influence of Millet—including The Belated Kid (1854–57), Girl at the Fountain (1852), Hurdy-Gurdy Boy (1851)—studies characterized by simplicity in drawing and tone. The public demand at the time, however, was for portraits, and Hunt obtained many commissions from well-known patrons. Many of his paintings and sketches, together with his art collection, were destroyed by the great Boston fire of 1872. He received a major commission in 1878 to paint two murals for the capitol in Albany, New York: entitled The Flight of Night and The Discoverer, they eventually were lost as a result of the disintegration of the stone panels on which they were painted. In his later work, he focused predominately on the American landscape.
Hunt wrote (Talks on Art, 1878) and was a magnetic and persuasive teacher; among those influenced by him were the painter John La Farge and William and Henry James.
