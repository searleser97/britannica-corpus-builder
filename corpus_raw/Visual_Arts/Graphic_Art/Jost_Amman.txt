Jost Amman,  (born June 13, 1539, Zürich, Switz.—died  March 17, 1591, Nürnberg, Bavaria [Germany]), painter and printmaker, one of the most prolific and skilled book illustrators of the 16th century.
Amman was educated in Zürich and worked for a short time in Basel, where he designed glass paintings for prominent families. About 1560–61 he moved to Nürnberg but retained his citizenship of Zürich until 1577.
His engraving of the poet-dramatist Hans Sachs testifies to his craftsmanship. In numerous drawings, such as “Entry of Maximilian II into Nürnberg in 1570,” he revealed himself as a brilliant and witty recorder of contemporary events. His engravings include historical portraits, such as those of the kings of France; heraldic designs; title pages; and scenes of warfare, hunting, and pageantry. He also produced thousands of woodcuts for various works. One of the most notable was a book on the arts and crafts with poems by Hans Sachs entitled Eygentliche Beschreibung aller Stände auff Erden (1568; “Actual Description of All the Professions in the World”).
