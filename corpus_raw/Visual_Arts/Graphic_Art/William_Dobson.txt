William Dobson,  (baptized March 4, 1611, London, England—buried October 28, 1646, London), English portrait painter, one of the first distinguished native English painters.
While an apprentice to a stationer and picture dealer, the young Dobson began to copy the pictures of Titian and Anthony Van Dyck and also to draw pictures from life. Van Dyck, happening to pass a shop in Snow Hill where one of Dobson’s pictures was visible, sought out the artist and presented him to Charles I, who took Dobson under his protection and not only sat for him several times for his own portrait but also had the prince of Wales, Prince Rupert, and many others do the same. The king had a high opinion of his artistic ability, styled him the English Tintoretto, and appointed him sergeant-painter on the death of Van Dyck. After Charles’s fall, Dobson was reduced to great poverty, and he died at age 36.
