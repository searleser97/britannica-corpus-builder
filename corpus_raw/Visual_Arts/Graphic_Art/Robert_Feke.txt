Robert Feke,  (born c. 1705, Long Island, New York [U.S.]—died c. 1750, West Indies), British-American painter whose portraits depict the emerging colonial aristocracy.
The facts of Feke’s life are uncertain: stories differ over his employment as a mariner, his supposed travels, and his artistic training. The record of his work, however—created in Boston, Philadelphia, and his home at Newport, Rhode Island—is reasonably clear. About 15 portraits are signed and dated, and his manner is distinctive enough to support the attribution of about 50 more works to him. Samuel Waldo (c. 1742) is among his best portraits. Feke only sporadically managed to penetrate a sitter’s character, and his figures often appear stiff and awkward. He is considered a major 18th-century colonial American talent, however, because of his use of luminous colour, his naturalistic rendering of textures, and the vitality of his compositions.
