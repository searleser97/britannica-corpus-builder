Thomas Girtin,  (born Feb. 18, 1775, London, Eng.—died  Nov. 9, 1802, London), British artist who at the turn of the 19th century firmly established the aesthetic autonomy of watercolour (formerly used mainly to colour engravings) by employing its transparent washes to evoke a new sense of atmospheric space.
While still boys, Girtin and his friend J.M.W. Turner were employed to wash in skies for architectural drawings and in colouring prints for a printseller. Girtin made copies and sketches from the works of a number of artists, and in 1794 he began to exhibit at the Royal Academy. He went on numerous sketching tours, chiefly in the north of England, and founded a sketching club for young artists. During 1801–02 he visited Paris and produced a series of etchings of that city. His gigantic panorama of London, the Eidometropolis, was exhibited in 1802, shortly before his premature death.
Girtin’s earlier landscapes are in the 18th-century topographical manner, but in his last years he evolved a bold, spacious, and Romantic style—in spirit akin to the contemporary poetry of William Wordsworth—that greatly influenced English landscape painting. Girtin’s increasing power and consummate mastery of the art of watercolour are evident in such late works as The White House, Chelsea (1800).
