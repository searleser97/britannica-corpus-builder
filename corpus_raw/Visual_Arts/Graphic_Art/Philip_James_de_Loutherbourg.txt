Philip James de Loutherbourg, Loutherbourg also spelled Lutherbourg, or Lauterbourg, also called Philipp Jakob II, or Jacques Philippe II,  (born Oct. 31, 1740, Fulda, Abbacy of Fulda—died March 11, 1812, Chiswick, Middlesex, Eng.), early Romantic painter, illustrator, printmaker, and scenographer, especially known for his paintings of landscapes and battles and for his innovative scenery designs and special effects for the theatre.
First trained under his father, a miniature painter from Strasbourg, about 1755 he worked in Paris under Charles Van Loo, the Tischbeins, and finally Francesco Casanova. He was received into the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1767, and at the official Salon exhibitions he won the praise of Denis Diderot.
In 1771 he went to London with an introduction to the actor-manager David Garrick, who hired him in 1773 as his regular adviser on scenic effects at Drury Lane Theatre. Loutherbourg created elaborate Romantic settings that were designed to bathe the entire stage in an atmosphere of picturesque illusion. He worked as a theatrical designer until 1785 and is considered the first to have introduced scrims (gauzes that appear solid or transparent depending on the direction of light) and three-dimensional scenery. He also experimented with coloured media for lighting. His Eidophusikon, a miniature theatre, demonstrated these techniques in a smaller, more controlled environment.
He was made a member of the British Royal Academy in 1780. He illustrated Macklin’s Bible and an edition of the works of Shakespeare. His Romantic landscapes influenced J.M.W. Turner and other English artists.
