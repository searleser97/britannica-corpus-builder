Mary Lizzie Macomber,  (born August 21, 1861, Fall River, Massachusetts, U.S.—died February 4, 1916, Boston), American artist remembered for her highly symbolic, dreamlike paintings.
Macomber studied drawing with a local artist from about 1880 to 1883, then at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston for a year, until ill health cut short her studies. After her recovery she studied briefly with Frank Duveneck and then opened a studio in Boston. In 1889 her painting Ruth was exhibited in the National Academy of Design show in New York City. Over the next 13 years she exhibited 25 more paintings at the National Academy and was a frequent exhibitor at other major museums and galleries.
Macomber’s symbolic, allegorical, and decorative panels, revealing the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, were widely admired by her contemporaries. Among her more celebrated works are Love Awakening Memory (1892), Love’s Lament (1893), St. Catherine (1897), The Hour Glass (1900), The Lace Jabot (1900; a self-portrait), Night and Her Daughter Sleep (1903), and Memory Comforting Sorrow (1905). In the later years of her career she also devoted much time to portraiture.
