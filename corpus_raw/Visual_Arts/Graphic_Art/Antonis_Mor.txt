Antonis Mor, Antonis also spelled Anthonis or Anthonius, also called Antonis Mor van Dashorst, Antonio Moro, or Anthony More,  (born c. 1520, Utrecht, Netherlandsâ€”died sometime between April 17, 1576, and May 12, 1577, Antwerp [now in Belgium]), North Netherlandish portrait painter.
Mor studied art under Jan van Scorel, and, after making a professional visit to Italy, he began to paint portraits in the style of Hans Holbein. His rise to eminence was rapid. In 1552 he was invited to Madrid by the emperor Charles V. In 1554 he was in London, painting the portrait of Queen Mary for her bridegroom, Philip II of Spain. That picture is his masterpiece. For it an annual salary and, supposedly, the honour of knighthood were conferred upon him.
