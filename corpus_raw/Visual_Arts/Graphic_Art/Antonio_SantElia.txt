Antonio Sant’Elia,  (born April 30, 1888, Como, Italy—died  Oct. 10, 1916, near Monfalcone), Italian architect notable for his visionary drawings of the city of the future.
In 1912 he began practicing architecture in Milan, where he became involved with the Futurist movement. Between 1912 and 1914 he made many highly imaginative drawings and plans for cities of the future. A group of these drawings called Città Nuova (“New City”) was displayed in May 1914 at an exhibition of the Nuove Tendenze group, of which he was a member. Although Sant’Elia’s ideas were Futuristic, it has been questioned whether he was actually a member of the group. Essentially he was a socialist who felt that a complete break with architectural styles of the past and historic solutions to urban design was needed.
The hundreds of Sant’Elia’s drawings that have survived depict various aspects and vistas of a highly mechanized and industrialized city, with skyscrapers and multilevel traffic circulation. A collection of these drawings is on permanent exhibition at Villa Olmo, near Como.
Sant’Elia volunteered for army duty shortly after the outbreak of World War I, and he died in the battle of Monfalcone.
