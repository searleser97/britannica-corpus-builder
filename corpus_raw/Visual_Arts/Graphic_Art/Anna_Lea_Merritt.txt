Anna Lea Merritt, original name Anna Lea,  (born September 13, 1844, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died April 7, 1930, Hurstbourne Tarrant, Dorset [now in Hampshire], England), American artist whose skills as an etcher and painter found expression most often in portraiture and narrative subjects.
Merritt displayed artistic talent from an early age. After studying with William H. Furness in Philadelphia for several years, she went to Europe, where she studied mainly in Dresden, Germany, and, from 1871, in London. By the middle 1870s she was exhibiting paintings regularly at London’s Royal Academy, and in 1876 her submission to the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia won a medal. In 1877 she married her British teacher, Henry Merritt. Upon her marriage she gave up her career, but when her husband died just three months later she resumed it. She wrote a memoir of her husband and supplied 23 small etchings for Henry Merritt: Art Criticism and Romance (1879).
Merritt’s major works over the next decades include Taming the Bird (c. 1883), Camilla (1882), and Love Locked Out (1889), which in 1890 became the first work of a woman artist to be purchased for the Tate Gallery, the museum that houses the national collection of British art. Merritt’s Eve Overcome by Remorse and a mural decoration for the Woman’s Building at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago (1893) both won medals. In 1902 she published A Hamlet in Old Hampshire, a portrait of Hurstbourne Tarrant, her home from 1890. Merritt continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy until 1906. Her later years were plagued by failing eyesight. In 1981 Love Locked Out: The Memoirs of Anna Lea Merritt was published.
