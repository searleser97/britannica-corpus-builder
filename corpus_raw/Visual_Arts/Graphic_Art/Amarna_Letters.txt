Amarna Letters,  cache of clay tablets discovered at Tell el-Amarna in Egypt and dating to the reigns of kings Amenhotep III and Akhenaton of the 18th dynasty. The Amarna Letters provide invaluable insight into the nature of diplomatic relations among the great nations and petty states of the 14th century bce, as well as an incomplete and tantalizing hint of the strategic maneuvering that occupied them.
Written in an archaic and somewhat provincialized form of Babylonian cuneiform, the tablets represent part of the correspondence between the Egyptian court and other states and vassals of the ancient Middle East. Letters from the great powers (Babylonia, Assyria, Mitanni, and the Hittite court) are often preoccupied with the exchange of gifts and diplomatic marriages. Those from the vassal states of Syro-Palestine deal with the local political and military situation and are often filled with complaints of inattention on the part of the Egyptian court. The tablets have been preserved in various museums around the world, and the majority of them are distributed among institutions in Berlin, London, and Cairo.
