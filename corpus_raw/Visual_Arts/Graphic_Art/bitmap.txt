Bitmap,  method by which a display space (such as a graphics image file) is defined, including the colour of each of its pixels (or bits). In effect, a bitmap is an array of binary data representing the values of pixels in an image or display. A GIF is an example of a graphics image file that has a bitmap. When the GIF is displayed on a computer monitor, the computer reads the bitmap to determine which colours to use to “paint” the screen. In a bitmapped font, each character is defined as a pattern of dots in a bitmap.
