Kleinmeister, also called N端rnberg Kleinmeister,  group of engravers, working mostly in N端rnberg in the second quarter of the 16th century, whose forms and subjects were influenced by the works of Albrecht D端rer. Their engravings were small and thus easily portable. Usually flawless in technique, they stressed topical, didactic, intimate, and often familiar and popular subjects meant for mass appeal.
The artists used classical forms derived from D端rer and from the works of contemporary Italian artists, which gradually introduced the influence of Italian Mannerist forms. The most important member of the group was Hans Sebald Beham; others were his brother Barthel, Georg Pencz, Hendrich Aldegrever, and Jakob Binck.
