Jan Bruegel the Elder, byname Velvet Bruegel, Dutch Jan Bruegel de Oude or Fluwelen Bruegel, Bruegel also spelled Brueghel or Breughel,  (born 1568, Brussels [now in Belgium]—died January 13, 1625, Antwerp), Flemish painter known for his still lifes of flowers and for his landscapes.
The second son of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, born just before his father’s death, he was reared by a grandmother and learned his art in Antwerp. In his youth he went to Italy, where he painted under the patronage of Federigo Cardinal Borromeo, and later, in 1610, he was appointed court painter to the archdukes of Habsburg Austria. He worked primarily in Antwerp and was a friend of Peter Paul Rubens, with whom he sometimes collaborated in painting flowers, landscape, and animals on canvases on which Rubens supplied the human figures; an example is Adam and Eve in Paradise (1620).
His son Jan Bruegel II (1601–78) was also a painter; his subjects and techniques were similar to (and often indistinguishable from) the father’s.
