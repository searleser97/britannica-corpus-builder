Thomas Aloysius Dorgan, pseudonym Tad,  (born April 29, 1877, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.—died  May 2, 1929, Great Neck, N.Y.), American journalist, boxing authority, and cartoonist credited with inventing a variety of colourful American slang expressions.
At an early age Dorgan became a cartoonist and comic artist for the San Francisco Bulletin. In 1902 he moved to William Randolph Hearst’s New York Journal, where he began to concentrate his interests on sports, particularly boxing, a subject upon which he was considered an expert. His sketches of fighters and boxing commentaries were widely syndicated throughout the country, as were his daily cartoons, which featured characters such as “Silk Hat Harry” and “Judge Rummy.”
Dorgan’s most enduring contributions were to American slang. He coined the terms “hot dog” (wiener), “hard-boiled” (tough men), and “cheaters” (eyeglasses). He also invented the superlatives “the cat’s meow” and “the cat’s pajamas” and the exclamation “For crying out loud!”
