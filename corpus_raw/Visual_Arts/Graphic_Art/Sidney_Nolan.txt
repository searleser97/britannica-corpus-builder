Sir Sidney Nolan, in full Sir Sidney Robert Nolan,  (born April 22, 1917, Melbourne, Australia—died November 27, 1992, London, England), artist known for his paintings based on Australian folklore.
With little formal art training, Nolan turned to painting at age 21 after varied experiences as a racing cyclist, cook, and gold miner. In his early work he was influenced by the abstract artists Paul Klee and László Moholy-Nagy, and his own greatly simplified abstractions, such as Boy and the Moon (1940)—a splash of yellow against a raw blue background—incited controversy among visitors to his Melbourne studio. He designed sets and costumes for a Sydney production of Serge Lifar’s ballet Icarus in 1940.
Nolan served in the Australian army from 1942 to 1945, during which time he began to paint the local desolate desert landscapes in a more representational style. Apart from his landscapes, most of his mature works dealt with Australian historical or legendary characters and events—notably, the bushranger Ned Kelly, a famous outlaw whose square helmet is an iconic image in Australia. Nolan’s painting style is noted for its fluidity, which he emphasized by applying unusual mediums—such as ripolin (an enamel house paint) and polyvinyl acetate—to masonite, glass, paper, or canvas.
Nolan moved to England in 1955, but he continued to paint his native Australian landscapes, among other themes. He remained involved with the theatre, designing stage sets for a production of Igor Stravinsky’s ballet The Rite of Spring in London in 1962 and for Camille Saint-Saëns’s opera Samson et Dalila, also in London, in 1981. Nolan’s work has been exhibited internationally, and many of his paintings and prints are in the permanent collections of the Tate Gallery in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. He was knighted in 1981 and became a member of the Order of Merit in 1983.
