Okumura Masanobu, original name Okumura Shinmyō,  also called Genpachi,  (born 1686, Edo [now Tokyo], Japan—died  1764/68, Edo), painter and publisher of illustrated books who introduced innovations in woodblock printing and print-design technique in Japan.
Masanobu taught himself painting and print designs by studying the works of Torii Kiyonobu (died 1729), thus starting his career as Torii’s imitator. About 1724 Masanobu became a publisher of illustrated books and brought out his own works. He was one of the first to adopt Western perspective through the Chinese prints available in Edo at that time. He produced large-scale prints depicting such scenes as the inside of theatres, stores, and sumptuous living quarters. Such prints were called uki-e (“looming picture”) prints for the foreshortening perspective effects they produced. He is also said to have founded the format of habahiro hashira-e, or wide, vertical prints. His style was noted for its vividness with gentle and graceful lines, which also showed restraint and dignity.
Among Masanobu’s numerous works dealing with diverse subject matters are the print “Inside the Theatre” and the paintings “Sound of the Koto” and “Oshichi Kichisaburō.”
