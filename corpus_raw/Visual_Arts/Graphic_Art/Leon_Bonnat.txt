Léon Bonnat, in full Léon-Joseph-Florentin Bonnat,  (born June 20, 1833, Bayonne, France—died September 8, 1922, Monchy-St-Éloi), notable French portrait painter and teacher of several well-known artists.
Bonnat studied under Federico Madrazo in Madrid and, sponsored by the city of Bayonne, under Léon Cogniet in Paris. His earlier works are religious paintings in which his study of Spanish Baroque art is evident. His later and better-known portrait series of prominent Europeans and Americans was begun in 1875. In these he drew inspiration from Diego Velázquez and the Spanish realists. His subjects included Adolphe Thiers, Victor Hugo, Hippolyte Taine, Louis Pasteur, J.-A.-D. Ingres, and other contemporaries. He painted about 200 portraits, most of them featuring photographically accurate draftsmanship and subdued colouring.
In 1888 Bonnat became professor of painting at the École des Beaux-Arts, and he became its director in 1905. He was an influential teacher—his students included Thomas Eakins, Gustave Caillebotte, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec—and he ran a busy studio for more than three decades. His excellent and wide-ranging art collection is part of the Bonnat Museum in Bayonne.
