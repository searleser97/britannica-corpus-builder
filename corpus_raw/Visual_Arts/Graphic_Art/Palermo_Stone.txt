Palermo Stone,  one of the basic sources of information about the chronology and cultural history of ancient Egypt during the first five dynasties (c. 2925–c. 2325 bce). Named for the Sicilian city where it has been preserved since 1877, the black basalt stone is one of six existing fragments from a single stela that probably originally stood in an Egyptian temple or other important building. It is inscribed on both sides with horizontal lines of hieroglyphic text, the top row listing the names of predynastic rulers. The following rows, each headed by the name of a different king, are divided into compartments, each compartment signifying one year. Within the compartments the hieroglyphs always list one or more memorable events of that year. Thus, the original monument was apparently a year-by-year record of all the kings from the 1st through the 5th dynasty (c. 2925–c. 2325 bce), although the last name preserved on the stone is that of Neferirkare (see Ancient Egypt: The 5th dynasty), the third of the nine kings of the 5th dynasty.
