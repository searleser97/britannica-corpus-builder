Jan van der Heyden,   (born March 5, 1637, Gorinchem, Neth.—died  March 28, 1712, Amsterdam), leading painter of cityscapes in late-17th-century Holland, especially known for his views of Amsterdam done in the 1660s.
Little is known of his early life, though it is recorded that van der Heyden studied under a Dutch glass painter. In 1650 van der Heyden’s family moved to Amsterdam, where he lived for the rest of his life. Recurrent subjects in his paintings seem to indicate he traveled to Brussels, Cologne, and perhaps even farther before his marriage in 1661. Later in life he possibly visited London.
Although he painted a few landscapes and still-life pictures, van der Heyden’s reputation rests upon his architectural subjects—the town views that he painted in early maturity. In these he combined breadth of general effect with remarkable attention to detail. His feats of technical virtuosity, such as separately realizing each brick of his houses, have continually amazed his viewers. His pictures are well composed and harmoniously coloured, exploiting contrasts of foliage and mellow brickwork. His cityscapes were very influential in the development of architectural painting in 18th-century Holland. Van der Heyden was also interested in mechanical inventions and in 1690 published Brandspuiten-boek (“Fire Engine Book”), a study of fire-fighting equipment illustrated with his own etchings.
