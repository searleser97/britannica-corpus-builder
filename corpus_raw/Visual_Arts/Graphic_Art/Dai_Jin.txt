Dai Jin, Wade-Giles romanization Tai Chin, courtesy name (zi) Wenjin,  (born 1388, Qiantang, Zhejiang province, China—died 1462), Chinese landscape painter of the Ming dynasty.
Dai was one of the leaders in the early Ming revival of the Ma-Xia (after Ma Yuan and Xia Gui), or academic, style of landscape painting of the Southern Song (1127–1279), which came to be called the Zhe school (after Zhejiang province, in which Hangzhou, the Southern Song capital, was located). The Zhe school was later placed within the lineage of “professional” painters and held in lesser regard in contrast to the school of literary “amateurs,” who were more concerned with personal expression and who were then represented in the Wu school in which Shen Zhou held an equivalent place of leadership.
Dai did not merely repeat the patterns of the Southern Song academy but rather, like other artists of other schools and traditions of the time, he saw the past as providing motifs for further elaboration. He did this with pictorial virtuosity, but he replaced the former compositional unity apparent in the works of others with a new additive and even fragmentary sense.
