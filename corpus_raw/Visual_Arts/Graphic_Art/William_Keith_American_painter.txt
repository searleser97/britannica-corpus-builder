William Keith,  (born November 21, 1839, Old Meldrum, Aberdeen, Scotland—died April 13, 1911, Berkeley, California, U.S.), Scottish-born American painter known for his California landscapes.
Settling in California in 1859, Keith was encouraged by critical approval and sales of his first landscapes to study abroad in 1869–70. For 40 years thereafter, from his studios in San Francisco, he produced thousands of conventional woodland scenes and serene mountain landscapes from his field sketches of the Sierra Nevada, of California live oaks, and of the Yosemite. The influence of Camille Corot and George Inness is evident in his later works, in which the softened forms and muted details of meadows and groves are set off against dusky twilight skies. His landscapes are represented at two Keith galleries in California (at St. Mary’s College, Moraga, and at the Oakland Museum of Art).
