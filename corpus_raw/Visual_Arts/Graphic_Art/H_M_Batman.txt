H.M. Bateman, in full Henry Mayo Bateman,  (born February 15, 1887, Sutton Forest, New South Wales, Australia—died February 13, 1970, Malta), cartoonist known for narrative cartoons and for cartoons of situations involving social gaffes.
After studying drawing and painting, Bateman began drawing for publication in 1906. Before World War I his work had appeared in Punch and other publications. A notable series of cartoons consisted of a wordless sequence of drawings. One, dating from 1916 and captioned “Prisoner when arrested, clung to the railing…,” showed the arrest of a soapbox orator; successive panels depicted increasingly forceful efforts to remove him from the fence railings, ending with the section of fence cut away and being carried off by the police with the orator still attached.
Another notable series involved the odd man out, a solitary figure that had just committed an unpardonable breach of convention, surrounded by an outraged crowd. One of these was captioned, “The Guest Who Called ‘Pâté de Foie Gras’ Potted Meat.”
