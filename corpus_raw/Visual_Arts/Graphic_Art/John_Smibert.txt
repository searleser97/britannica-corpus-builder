John Smibert, Smibert also spelled Smybert,  (born April 2, 1688, Edinburgh, Scotland—died March 2, 1751, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.), Scottish-born painter and architect who established an early tradition of colonial portraiture in Boston.
Smibert was apprenticed to a house painter in Edinburgh and in 1709 went to London. In 1713 he studied at London’s Great Queen Street’s Academy, which was run by Sir Godfrey Kneller, whose late-Baroque style would influence Smibert. After traveling in Italy (1719–22) Smibert went back to London, and, between 1725 and 1728, he kept a studio in Covent Garden. In 1728 he accompanied George Berkeley on an unsuccessful mission to establish a college for colonists in Bermuda (Smibert was to be an art teacher there). The duo never reached Bermuda, but instead arrived in Rhode Island in 1729.
In 1730 Smibert went to Boston, where he spent the rest of his life. He painted many prominent Bostonians, primarily merchants, but had to supplement his income by keeping a shop, where he sold art supplies and prints. His collection of copies of paintings by Old Masters and casts of ancient sculpture, which he displayed in a studio above his shop, was unique in colonial America. This “gallery” influenced the development of several later artists, notably John Singleton Copley, Robert Feke, John Trumbull, and Washington Allston. In 1742 he drew the plans for Faneuil Hall, Boston’s first public market. Smibert’s notebooks, which are preserved in the Public Records Office in London, were published in facsimile form in 1969.
