Arnold Newman, in full Arnold Abner Newman,  (born March 3, 1918, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died June 6, 2006, New York City), American photographer, who specialized in portraits of well-known people posed in settings associated with their work. This approach, known as “environmental portraiture,” greatly influenced portrait photography in the 20th century.
Newman studied art at the University of Miami in Florida from 1936 to 1938 and then took a job as an assistant in a photography studio. In 1941 Newman had his first major exhibition in New York City. After years of frequently visiting New York, he moved there and opened his own portrait studio in 1946. Although his early portraits concentrated on well-known artists, he gradually broadened his subject matter to include famous people of all types, including writers, composers, political leaders, scientists, and business magnates, usually posing them in their own space or in a space that was constructed to reflect their character. Among his best-known portraits is one from 1946 of Igor Stravinsky at his piano. Other well-known subjects include Max Ernst, Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O’Keeffe, Marilyn Monroe, Alfried Krupp, Pablo Picasso, and Jean Cocteau. Newman published many of his portraits in magazines such as Harper’s Bazaar, Time, Look, and Life. (For examples of Arnold’s portraiture, see Hans Hofmann, Lyndon B. Johnson, Eero Saarinen, George Segal, and Philip C. Johnson.)
The 76 photographic portraits of eminent Britons that Newman made for the National Portrait Gallery in London were published in the book The Great British (1979). Many of his other portraits are collected in the books One Mind’s Eye (1974), Faces USA (1978), Artists: Portraits from Four Decades (1980), Arnold Newman: Five Decades (1986), Arnold Newman’s Americans (1992), and Arnold Newman (1999). A film about him, The Image Makers—the Environment of Arnold Newman, was produced in 1977. A major selection of his work was acquired by George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y., in 1994.
