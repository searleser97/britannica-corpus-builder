Giovanni Battista Moroni,  (born c. 1525, Albino, Republic of Venice [Italy]—died February 5, 1578, Bergamo), Italian Renaissance painter notable for his sober and dignified portraits.
Moroni was a pupil of the local painter Moretto da Brescia, who strongly influenced Moroni’s manner in painting religious compositions. It is Moroni’s portraits that have earned him his importance, however, for he was one of the few Italian Renaissance artists who made portraiture their chief specialty. His portraits were mostly of the petty aristocracy and bourgeoisie of Bergamo. He also worked in Brescia and Trento, where he painted mostly religious works. One of his best-known works is The Tailor (1565–70). Moroni emphasized a sitter’s dignity and nobility by means of natural, unforced poses and masterful compositions and infused his portraits with physiognomic individuality and psychological depth. Despite their impassive facial expressions, many of his portraits impart a sense of gentle melancholy that is reinforced by predominantly gray tonalities and by a restrained treatment of the textures of cloth and draperies. Moroni’s simple yet subtle style of portraiture was clearly influenced by that of Titian, who himself commended Moroni’s work. Among Moroni’s other more-notable portraits are the Portrait of Pietro Secco Suardo (1563) and the Portrait of Gian Gerolamo Grumelli (c. 1560).
