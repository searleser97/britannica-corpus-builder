Domenico Campagnola,  (born c. 1500, Venice, Republic of Venice [Italy]—died c. 1563, Padua, Republic of Venice), Italian painter and printmaker and one of the first professional draftsmen.
A pupil of the Paduan engraver Giulio Campagnola, Domenico did not follow Giulio’s stipple technique in his own work, preferring a looser touch and picturesque effect. Early in his career, he is known to have assisted the Venetian painter Titian with a series of frescoes in Padua, and Titian’s brilliant use of colour and pioneering composition based on movement remained a great influence on his style. He was chiefly active in and around Padua, where he decorated many of the churches and palaces with frescoes. He is also renowned as an engraver and as a cutter and designer of woodcuts. He was a prolific draftsman, usually working in pen and ink, and was among the first to make his drawings ends in themselves rather than preparatory studies. His drawings have often been wrongly attributed either to Titian or to Giorgione.
