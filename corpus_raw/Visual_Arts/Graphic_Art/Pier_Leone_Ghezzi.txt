Pier Leone Ghezzi,  (born 1674, Rome—died  1755, Rome), Italian artist and probably the first professional caricaturist.
Ghezzi made religious paintings for Roman churches but was best known for penned and etched caricatures of Rome’s residents and tourists. He often portrayed a single figure with exaggerated anatomy and appropriate eccentricities of clothing and posture. In group portraits he produced comedy by repeating an awkward stance or expression. He also parodied classical symbols, such as making a Janus, the two-faced Roman god of departures, from two unsuspecting elderly men placed back to back.
