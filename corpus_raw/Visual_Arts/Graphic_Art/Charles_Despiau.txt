Charles Despiau, in full Charles-Albert Despiau,  (born November 4, 1874, Mont-de-Marsan, France—died October 30, 1946, Paris), French sculptor and illustrator who is best known for portrait busts executed in a sensitive and classical style.
Despiau studied at Parisian art schools from 1891 to 1896. He exhibited his sculpture in Paris over the next 10 years; Auguste Rodin saw one of Despiau’s portrait busts and in 1907 invited him to work as his assistant. Under Rodin, Despiau honed his technical skills but came to reject his mentor’s intense Romanticism in favour of a return to the simplicity of Archaic Classical sculpture. Despiau’s style is often compared to that of Aristide Maillol because of their common interest in a dignified Classical aesthetic. However, Despiau’s work is distinguished by the more highly detailed rendering of his subjects’ individual characteristics.
Modeling principally in plaster but sometimes working in stone, Despiau usually created portrait busts, but he also executed life-size figures and drew book illustrations. Among his bronzes are Faunesse (1924), Eve (1925), and Dominique (1926). Assia (1938) is one of his efforts in terra-cotta. He completed only one large-scale work, a war memorial (1920–22) for the town of his birth. His book illustrations include a 1933 edition of the French poet Charles Baudelaire’s Les Fleurs du mal (“The Flowers of Evil”).
