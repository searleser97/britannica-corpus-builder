Hiragushi Denchū, also called Takutarō,  (born Feb. 23, 1872, Okayama prefecture, Japan—died Dec. 30, 1979, Tokyo), sculptor who worked to preserve traditional Japanese wood-carving methods.
Hiragushi set out for Ōsaka at the age of 21 to receive training in wood sculpture from a doll-carving expert, training that greatly influenced his work in later years. He also studied ancient Buddhist images for two years in Nara, where he carved an image of Kannon. In 1898 Hiragushi moved to Tokyo to become the student of Takamura Kōun, leading wood sculptor of the period, who led the movement to blend the method of Buddhist idol sculpture with modern European realism. Hiragushi became active in the Nihon Bijutsuin (“Japanese Fine Arts Academy”), and from 1899 he participated in the Nihon Bijutsu Kyō kai exhibitions. He was also active in the annual exhibits of the Ministry of Culture. With the support of Okakura Kakuzō he and other sculptors founded in 1907 the Nihon Chōkoku Kai (“Japan Sculpture Association”), which held exhibits from 1908. In 1937 Hiragushi was elected to the Teikoku Geijutsuin (“Imperial Art Academy”) and in 1962 was awarded the Order of Cultural Merit. From 1944 to 1952, Hiragushi taught wood sculpture at what is now the Tokyo University of Fine Arts and Music. In 1971 he donated his old residence in the Ueno district of Tokyo to be turned into a museum to exhibit modern Japanese sculpture, and he moved to a Japanese-style house in the Tokyo suburb of Kodaira. In 1972, to mark his 100th birthday, he established the Hiragushi Denchū Prize to encourage young sculptors.
Hiragushi was especially known for his realistic and often brightly coloured portrait sculptures. His style combined the style of the tempyō sculpture of the Nara period with that of the small, sculptured portraits in wood of the post-Edo period. He also combined Western realism with the more spiritual Asian approach. Among representative works are “Tensei” (1920; “Transmigration”) and “Goura tsuriudo” (1930; “The Angler at Goura”). He also carved a statue of the critic Okakura Kakuzō (1942), one of his teachers. The most popular of his works, however, is a series of life-size models of the well-known Kabuki actor Onoe Kikugorō VI, costumed for the kagamijishi, or lion dance. The two best known of these, begun in the 1930s, were completed in 1940 and 1958.
