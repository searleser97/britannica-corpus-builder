Jacob Maris, in full Jacobus Hendrikus Maris,  (born August 25, 1837, The Hague, Netherlands—died August 7, 1899, Karlsbad, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic]), Dutch landscape painter who, with his brothers Matthijs and Willem, formed what has come to be known as the Hague school of painters, influenced by both the 17th-century Dutch masters and the Barbizon school.
Maris was the son of an etcher and lithographer. He studied first at the Antwerp Academy and then in Paris (1865–71). His early work contained figures (children, young women), but he is best known for the landscapes he began painting about 1872. These include scenes from the Dutch countryside of bridges and windmills, old quays, massive towers, and level banks, against misty skies or chasing clouds. In all his paintings, whether in watercolour or oil, and in his etchings, the subject is subordinate to the atmospheric effect, as in the Grey Tower, Old Amsterdam (c. 1880) and Landscape near Dordrecht (c. 1870). This mastery of atmosphere influenced many of his contemporaries.
