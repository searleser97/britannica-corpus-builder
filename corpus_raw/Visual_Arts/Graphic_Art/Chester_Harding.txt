Chester Harding,  (born September 1, 1792, Conway, Massachusetts, U.S.—died April 1, 1866, Boston), American painter of Romantic portraits of prominent American and English figures from the early 19th century.
Early in his life, Harding worked as a chair maker, peddler, innkeeper, and house painter. He eventually began to paint signs in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and became a self-taught, itinerant portrait painter. His reputation grew, and he was so in demand in Boston in the early 1820s—painting 80 portraits in six months—that he could afford a trip to England in 1823. He set up a studio in London and received important commissions to paint royalty and nobility. Despite his lack of education and sophistication, his casual charm and candour made him a favourite in many fashionable circles. His best portraits, executed after his return to the United States in 1826, include his likeness of Amos Lawrence (c. 1845).
Unlike other artists of his day, Harding did not aspire to be a history painter but rather accepted his status as a portraitist, producing more than 1,000 likenesses during his career. Along with Thomas Sully, John Neagle, and Henry Inman, Harding helped to elevate the importance of portrait painting in antebellum America.
