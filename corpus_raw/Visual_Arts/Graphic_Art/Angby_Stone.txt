Ängby Stone,   11th-century memorial stone found in Uppland, Swed., bearing a runic inscription carved by Asmund Kareson (Osmundus), earliest known professional rune carver in Uppland. The stone is inscribed with a Maltese cross surrounded by two intertwining serpents and bears the message: “Ragnfrid had this stone erected in memory of Björn, her and Kättilmund’s son. God and God’s Mother help his soul. He fell in Virland [in Estonia]. But Asmund engraved [the stone].” A replica of the inscription was found on another stone at Frösunda, Swed.
