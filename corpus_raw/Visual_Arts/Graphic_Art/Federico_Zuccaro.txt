Federico Zuccaro,  Zuccaro also spelled Zuccari,  (born c. 1540, Sant’Angelo in Vado, Urbino [Italy]—died July 20, 1609, Ancona), Italian painter and art theorist who became the central figure of the Roman Mannerist school and, after the death of Titian, possibly the best known painter in Europe.
Between 1555 and 1563 Zuccaro was the helper and pupil of his older brother, the painter Taddeo Zuccaro. Because of Taddeo’s close supervision of his brother’s work, the two had an intense rivalry for a time. Federico was offended, for example, when his brother retouched some of his work on the facade of Tizio da Spoleto’s home (1558). By the time he was 18, Zuccaro was already working in the Vatican, painting various rooms for Pius IV. In 1564 he traveled to Venice to decorate the Grimani Chapel in San Francesco della Vigna with various paintings, including Adoration of the Magi and Conversion of Mary Magdalene.
By 1565 Zuccaro had moved to Florence, where he worked under the painter, architect, and biographer Giorgio Vasari and codified the theory of Mannerism in L’idea de’ scultori, pittori e architetti (1607; “The Idea of Sculptors, Painters, and Architects”) and in a series of frescoes in his own house in Rome (Palazzo Zuccaro). After Taddeo’s death in 1566, Federico completed some of his brother’s unfinished commissions, including in the Villa Farnese at Caprarola; in the Sala Regia, where he painted Henry IV Before Gregory VII (1566); and at San Lorenzo (1568–70). He traveled through Spain, England, and the Netherlands in 1574.
In England in 1575 Zuccaro painted portraits of Queen Elizabeth I and the earl of Leicester (and probably no one else—the hundreds of portraits in England that bear his name are ascribed without foundation). His later commissions included the painting of the dome of Florence Cathedral, left unfinished by Vasari’s death (1575–79), the Pauline Chapel in the Vatican (1580), and a large work in the Palazzo Ducale at Venice in 1582. In 1585 he was commissioned by Philip II to decorate El Escorial (1585–88) in Madrid. Zuccaro’s Mannerist style was considered too formal, though, and much of his work was later replaced. In 1593 Zuccaro became the first president of the Academy of St. Luke in Rome, which is to some extent the parent body of modern art academies. His late paintings are much quieter and less mannered in style, and he lived to see Mannerism fade from the scene.
