Paulus Potter, in full Paulus Pieterszoon Potter, Paulus also spelled Paul,  (baptized November 20, 1625, Enkhuizen, Netherlands—buried January 17, 1654, Amsterdam), Dutch painter and etcher celebrated chiefly for his paintings of animals. Animals appear prominently in all of Potter’s works, sometimes singly but usually in small groups silhouetted against the sky, or in greater numbers with peasant figures and rustic buildings in an extensive landscape. Potter is one of the minor Dutch masters.
Potter entered the Guild of St. Luke at Delft in 1646. In 1649 he moved to The Hague, where in the following year he married Adriana, daughter of the architect Claes van Balkeneynde. In 1652 Potter settled in Amsterdam. He probably received his early training from his father, the painter Pieter Potter (c. 1597–1652), but his style shows little dependence upon that of earlier masters. In so short a career there was little development in style between the earlier and the later works, but 1647 seems to mark a peak in his achievement, for many of the finest paintings bear this date. Among works that depart from his normal scale or style, the huge Young Bull (1647), which is life-size, is his most celebrated though not necessarily his finest work, whereas Orpheus Charming the Beasts (1650) is an excursion into a poetic world. Potter’s etchings of animals show all the skill and sympathy of his paintings.
