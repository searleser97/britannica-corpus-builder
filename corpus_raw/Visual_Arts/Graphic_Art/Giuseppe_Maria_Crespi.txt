Giuseppe Maria Crespi, byname Lo Spagnolo (Italian: “The Spaniard”),  (born March 14, 1665, Bologna, Papal States [Italy]—died  March 25, 1747, Bologna), Italian Baroque painter who broke dramatically with the formal academic tradition to achieve a direct and immediate approach to his subject matter that was unparalleled at the time. Better known as a painter of genre scenes (pictures of everyday life), he also applied his innovative manner to religious paintings with impressive results.
After studying with the Bolognese painters Carlo Cignani and Domenico Maria Canuti, Crespi rejected their high-Baroque classicism after traveling to Venice and other cities of northern Italy, where he was impressed by the more fluid style of early Baroque painters, and soon modified his own style. Eventually he attempted an almost total realism. His religious works, portraits, and paintings of everyday contemporary scenes are all informed by a direct human response to the subject. One of his best-known works is The Flea. A late religious painting, St. Giovanni Nepomuceno Confessing to the Queen of Bohemia (1743), illustrates his naturalistic style. Crespi had no followers of note in Bologna, but his graceful treatment of genre subjects had considerable influence on two Venetian painters who were his pupils, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta and Pietro Longhi.
