John Kane, original name John Cain,  (born August 19, 1860, West Calder, Scotland—died August 10, 1934, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.), Scottish-born American artist who painted primitivist scenes of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Scotland.
In 1879, after working in a coal mine since childhood, John Cain immigrated to the United States (where a banker’s misspelling changed his name to Kane). He worked as a steelworker, gandy dancer (railroad man who stamps gravel between the ties), street paver, house painter, carpenter, and amateur boxer. After losing a leg in a railroad accident, he became a watchman and a boxcar painter. For his own pleasure he would paint landscapes on boxcars during his lunch break, covering them over with regulation flat paint in the afternoon. After losing his job in 1900, he continued painting landscapes and made a modest living colouring portrait photographs. He left his wife and home after the death of an infant son in 1904 and began to paint on beaverboard landscapes of the Pennsylvania countryside and cityscapes of Pittsburgh. He lived apart from his wife for the next 23 years.
Although he attempted to enter art schools on a number of occasions, Kane was unable to pay tuition. About 1908 he served, for a short period, as a studio assistant to the artist John White Alexander. His works were discovered in 1927, when his Scene from the Scottish Highland was accepted by the Carnegie International Exhibition in Pittsburgh. He won a prize at the Carnegie two years later, and museums began seeking his works. His autobiography, Sky Hooks, was published posthumously in 1938. An intense self-portrait (1929) in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City is his best-known work.
