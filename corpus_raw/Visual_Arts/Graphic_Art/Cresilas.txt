Cresilas, also spelled Kresilas,  (flourished 5th century bce, Athens), sculptor whose portrait of the Athenian statesman Pericles generated a type of noble, idealized portraiture. Cresilas was a contemporary of Phidias and one of the sculptors in a competition at Ephesus about 440 bce. His entry, a figure of a wounded Amazon, is ascribed to him from its resemblance in style to his head of Pericles. The figure is known only through copies.
