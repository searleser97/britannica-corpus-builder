Sir Thomas Brock,  (born March 1, 1847, Worcester, Worcestershire, Eng.â€”died  Aug. 22, 1922, London), English sculptor best known for the imperial memorial to Queen Victoria now in front of Buckingham Palace, London, for which he was knighted in 1911.
In all, Brock executed seven statues of Victoria and her portrait design on the coinage of 1897. Among his portrait sculptures are those of British statesman William Gladstone (1902) and the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1884), both in Westminster Abbey. His statue of Captain James Cook (1914) stands in the Mall in London.
He is associated with the New Sculpture movement that reinvigorated the classicizing British sculpture with a new elegance and vitality drawn from Renaissance and Baroque models.
