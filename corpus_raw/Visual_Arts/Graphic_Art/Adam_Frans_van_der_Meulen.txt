Adam Frans van der Meulen,  (baptized Jan. 11, 1632, Brussels, Spanish Netherlands [now in Belgium]—died Oct. 15, 1690, Paris, France), Flemish Baroque painter who specialized in battle scenes.
Meulen was a pupil of the painter of battle scenes Pieter Snayers, of the Flemish school, and was called to Paris about 1666 by the finance minister Jean Colbert, at the request of Charles Le Brun, to fill the post of battle painter to Louis XIV. His paintings of the campaigns in Flanders (1667) so delighted Louis that from that date van der Meulen was ordered to accompany him on all his campaigns. He also made many tapestry cartoons for the Gobelins factory depicting Louis’s military career. In 1673 he was received into the French Academy.
