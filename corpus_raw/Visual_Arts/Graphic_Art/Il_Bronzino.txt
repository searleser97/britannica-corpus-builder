Il Bronzino, original name Agnolo di Cosimo di Mariano Tori, Agnolo also spelled Agniolo,  (born November 17, 1503, Florence [Italy]—died November 23, 1572, Florence), Florentine painter whose polished and elegant portraits are outstanding examples of the Mannerist style. Classic embodiments of the courtly ideal under the Medici dukes of the mid-16th century, they influenced European court portraiture for the next century.
Bronzino studied separately under the Florentine painters Raffaellino del Garbo and Jacopo da Pontormo before beginning his career as an artist. His early work was greatly influenced by Pontormo. He adapted his master’s eccentric, expressive style (early Mannerism) to create a brilliant, precisely linear style of his own that was also partly influenced by Michelangelo and the late works of Raphael. Between 1523 and 1528, Bronzino and Pontormo collaborated on interior decorations for two Florentine churches. In 1530 Bronzino moved to Pesaro, where he briefly painted frescoes in the Villa Imperiale before returning to Florence in 1532.
From 1539 until his death in 1572, Bronzino served as the court painter to Cosimo I, duke of Florence. He was engaged in a variety of commissions, including decorations for the wedding of the duke to Eleonora of Toledo (1539) as well as a Florentine chapel in her honour (1540–45). Frescoes he painted there include Moses Striking the Rock, The Gathering of Manna, and St. John the Evangelist. He also created mythological paintings such as The Allegory of Luxury (also called Venus, Cupid, Folly, and Time; c. 1544–45), which reveals his love of complex symbolism, contrived poses, and clear, brilliant colours. By the 1540s he was regarded as one of the premier portrait painters in Florence. His Eleonora of Toledo with Her Son Giovanni and Portrait of a Young Girl with a Prayer Book (c. 1545) are preeminent examples of Mannerist portraiture: emotionally inexpressive, reserved, and noncommittal yet arrestingly elegant and decorative. Bronzino’s great technical proficiency and his stylized rounding of sinuous anatomical forms are also notable. His many other portraits of the royal family include Cosimo in Armour (1543), Giovanni with a Goldfinch (1545), and Cosimo at Age Thirty-Six (1555–56).
Bronzino’s last Mannerist painting was Noli me tangere (1561). As Italian artists abandoned Mannerism in the 1560s, Bronzino attempted to adjust his characteristic style by adding clarity to his work. This can be seen in his final paintings, including a Pietà (c. 1569) and Raising of the Daughter of Jairus (c. 1571–72), an altarpiece.
