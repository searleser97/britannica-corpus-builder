George Inness,  (born May 1, 1825, Newburgh, N.Y., U.S.—died Aug. 3, 1894, Bridge of Allen, Stirling, Scot.), American painter known especially for the luminous, atmospheric quality of his late landscapes.
Inness was largely self-taught. His early works such as The Lackawanna Valley (1855) reflect the influence of Asher B. Durand and Thomas Cole, painters of the Hudson River school. From about 1855 to 1874 Inness ascended to the height of his powers with works such as the Delaware Water Gap (1861) and the Delaware Valley (1865). His characteristic small canvases from this period show that he was no longer strictly preoccupied with the carefully rendered detail of the Hudson River school but instead began to explore light and colour in the manner of Camille Corot and the French Barbizon school. Inness’s increasing control over spatial relations, scale, drawing, and colour allowed him to achieve a sense of the idyllic and tranquil in his works.
From 1875 Inness’s works, such as Autumn Oaks (c. 1875), displayed a great concentration of feeling that presaged the ascendancy of colour over form in his late works. He explored the ideas he had articulated in an article titled “Colours and Le Correspondences,” in which he described the spiritual significance of specific colour combinations. As his mystical view of nature intensified, his pictures dissolved into shimmering colour, which was magnificent in itself and was no longer supported by formal construction. In The Home of the Heron, painted in 1893, Inness used subtle tonal variety to suggest a hazy atmosphere; the overlapping veils of colour unite earth and sky and underscore the harmony of the universe—a tenet central to Swedenborgianism, the belief system to which he adhered.
His son George Inness, Jr., was also a painter and remained faithful to the practices of the Barbizon school and resisted Impressionism in obedience to his father’s strongly expressed convictions.
