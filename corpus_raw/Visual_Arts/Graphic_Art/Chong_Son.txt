Chŏng Sŏn, also called Kyŏmja (Korean: “Humble Study”),  (born 1676, Korea—died  1759, Korea), noted painter who was the first Korean artist to depart from the Chinese academic models. He frequently left his studio to paint from direct observation of the world around him. Other Korean artists were soon inspired to follow his example.
Born into a humble family, Chŏng impressed an aristocratic neighbour with his artistic talents and, as a result, was recommended to the court, where he soon won official position. An extremely diligent man, he is said to have painted daily, well into his 80s. In technique, he was a member of the Southern school, but he developed a unique brush “wrinkle,” which consisted of bold vertical parallel strokes and which was said to be unforgettable.
