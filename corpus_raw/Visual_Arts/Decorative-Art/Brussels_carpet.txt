Brussels carpet,  type of machine-made floor covering with the loops of the pile uncut. All colours run with the warp, concealed, and are brought above the foundation in loops, as needed, to produce the pattern.
Thought to have originated in or near Brussels, this technique became fashionable in the first half of the 19th century. Brussels carpets have been made in many places. Wilton carpets follow a similar process, but the loops are cut, producing a pile surface.
