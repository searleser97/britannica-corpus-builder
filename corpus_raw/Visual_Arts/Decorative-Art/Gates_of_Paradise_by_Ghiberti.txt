Gates of Paradise, Italian Porta del Paradiso,   the pair of gilded bronze doors (1425–52) designed by the sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti for the north entrance of the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Florence. Upon their completion, they were installed at the east entrance.
   Each wing of the Gates of Paradise contains five large rectangular reliefs of scenes from the Old Testament between figurated borders containing statuettes in niches and medallions with busts. Their format differs completely from the traditional medieval quatrefoils of the other doors. The original doors were restored early in the 21st century, and they are now in the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo; replicas adorn the entrance to the baptistery. The classically modeled figures within the reliefs are placed in landscapes or in perspectivally rendered architecture to suggest a greater depth to the reliefs than actually exists. The 10 relief panels are among the greatest works of Early Renaissance sculpture. They demonstrate that Florentine artists had mastered linear perspective and the classical idiom by the early 15th century.
