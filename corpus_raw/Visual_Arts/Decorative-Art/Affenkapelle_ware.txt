Affenkapelle ware,   (German: “Monkey Orchestra”), a series of figures created by the Meissen porcelain factory in Saxony (now in Germany) about 1747 and imitated later. Believed to be a parody of the Dresden Court Orchestra, the set was modeled by the German sculptors Johann Joachim Kändler and Peter Reinicke after fanciful singerie (monkeys in human costume) engravings by the French artists Jean-Antoine Watteau and Christophe Huet. Each musician, dressed in delicately coloured formal 18th-century costume, stands on a gilded scrollwork base of leaves and flowers; a male monkey conducts, four females sing, and each of the others plays a musical instrument. In 1753 Meissen supplied the Marquise de Pompadour with a “concert” of 19 players, which is the largest known surviving group, though there is evidence that a whole set might have numbered 25. The figures belong to the most brilliant period of Meissen porcelain, and Kändler’s mastery of expression clearly transcends mere caricature. Among the many imitations that exist, most far less elegant than the original, are a set of five musical monkeys that were made in Chelsea (London) and sold there in 1756; figures from Fürstenberg (Germany) and Derby (England); and, 100 years later, a spirited hurdy-gurdy–playing monkey made by the Russian Korniloff factory and directly inspired by one of Kändler’s figures.
