Tilt-top table,   table, the top of which is hinged to a central pedestal in such a way that it can be turned from a horizontal to a vertical position and, thereby, when not in use, take up less space. Originally the idea was applied mainly to occasional (e.g., light, movable) tables of the kind used for tea and similar occasions.
By the 19th century, elaborate tilting devices were used so that quite large, circular dining tables could be made to tilt and, when not in use, could be placed against the wall. The fact that the tabletop was thus exposed to view stimulated the application of elaborate patterns in veneer and other techniques.
