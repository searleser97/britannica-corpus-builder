Inlay,  in the visual arts, any decorative technique used to create an ornamental design, pattern, or scene by inserting or setting into a shallow or depressed ground or surface a material of a different colour or type. Inlay techniques are used in enamelwork, furniture decoration, lacquerwork, and metalwork. Although not strictly inlay, marquetry and boulle work are often included techniques. Veneering is also closely allied.
