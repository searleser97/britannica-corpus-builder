Pomander,   small metal (sometimes china) container designed to hold a ball of aromatic spices or herbs. Worn suspended from neck or girdle or attached to the finger by a ring, it was believed to be a protection against infections and noxious smells. As fashionable jewelry in the late Middle Ages, pomanders were decorative objects often enriched with gems and enamels. Late in the 16th century, the original sphere shape was divided into several segments in order to accommodate a variety of powdered spices, and soon afterward pomanders in the form of dice, skulls, and books appeared.
They were succeeded in the 18th century and 19th century by the vinaigrette. In the 20th century, inexpensive pomanders are made by encrusting an orange with whole dried cloves. See also pouncet-box.
