Intarsia,  Form of wood inlay. Italian intarsia, or inlaid mosaic of wood, which probably derived from East Asian ivory and wood inlay, found its richest expression during the Renaissance in Italy (c. 1400â€“1600). It was often used in panels over the backs of choir stalls and in private studies and chapels of princes.
