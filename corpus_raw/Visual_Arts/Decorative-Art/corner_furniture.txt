Corner furniture,  movable articles, principally cupboards, cabinets, shelves, and chairs, designed to fit into the corner of a room, for the principal purpose of saving space. This style of furniture was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Because room corners generally form right angles, corner furniture was roughly triangular in section, with more or less equal sides. The two sides intended to stand closely against the walls were normally undecorated. The third side, facing into the room at an angle of 45° to the adjacent walls, was either straight or curved.
In France the corner cupboard was popular at the same time as the commode, and sometimes a pair of corner cupboards were made to match a commode, forming a suite. A variation consisting of a corner cupboard topped by corner shelves (with mirror glass fitted against the wall between them) and supported on legs was introduced into England from France. William Ince and John Mayhew illustrated two such pieces in their design book The Universal System of Household Furniture (1759–62). This type of furniture was the forerunner of the corner whatnot. Many corner cupboards had glass doors and were used to display china, art glass, and other wares. Similar pieces were used as corner bookcases.
Less common than cabinet furniture, corner chairs were introduced in the early 18th century under the term writing chairs; they fitted less closely to the walls than other types of corner furniture. The broad seat either had two straight sides and a curved front or was diamond-shaped. Both cabriole and straight legs were used, often in combination such that the front leg alone was curved. The low back formed a continuous bow with the arms. Corner furniture also includes types of continuous seating running along more than one side of a room, such as the ottoman.
