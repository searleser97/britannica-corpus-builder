Drop cut,  method of faceting gemstones into a pear shape suitable for pendants, earrings, and other jewelry. A pendeloque, a shape credited to Louis de Berquem in the 15th century, is a pear-shaped modification of the round brilliant cut used for diamonds. A briolette is an elongated pear-shaped stone covered with bands of triangular or rectangular facets, usually with a pointed end and lacking a girdle (the band separating the top or crown of the diamond from the bottom or pavilion).
