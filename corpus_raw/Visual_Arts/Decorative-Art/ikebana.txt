Ikebana,  traditionally, the classical art of Japanese flower arranging; the meaning of the term was later extended to encompass all the various styles of Japanese floral art. Ikebana was introduced in Japan in the 6th century by Chinese Buddhist missionaries who had formalized the ritual of offering flowers to the Buddha. The first school of flower arranging in Japan, Ikenobō, was founded by Ono no Imoko in the early 7th century. Based on a harmony of simple linear construction and an appreciation of the subtle beauty of flowers and natural material, ikebana has separated into several major schools according to historical periods and differing theories of artistic composition. The other major schools, in addition to Ikenobō, are Ko (Koryū), Ohara, and Sogetsū. For individual styles, see rikka, shōka, nageire, moribana, and zen’ei ikebana.
