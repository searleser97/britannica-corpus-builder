Bloomers,  “rational dress” for women advocated by Amelia Jenks Bloomer in the early 1850s. The entire costume, called the “Bloomer costume” or simply “bloomers,” consisted of a short jacket, a skirt extending below the knee, and loose “Turkish” trousers, gathered at the ankles.
The innovation stirred much controversy and eventually fell out of fashion. The name survived, however, to be used for Turkish-style pantaloons, divided skirts, knickerbockers that women wore while riding bicycles in the cycling craze of the 1890s, and women’s loose, baggy underwear.
