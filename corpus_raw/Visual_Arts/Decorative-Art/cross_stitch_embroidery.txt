Cross-stitch embroidery,  type of embroidery carried out on canvas or an evenly woven fabric in which the strands of the weave can be counted. Canvas work was executed at least as early as the Middle Ages, when it was known as opus pulvinarium, or cushion work. As its name implies, cross-stitch is a double stitch diagonally crossing intersections of the horizontal and vertical threads of the fabric. Because it is based on regular squares, it imposes a certain discipline and squaring-off of forms; flowers and the like are thus schematized rather than naturalistic.
