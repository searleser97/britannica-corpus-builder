Platform rocker, also called swing rocking chair,  rocking chair with rockers fixed to move on a stationary base rather than on the floor. Introduced in the United States about 1870, it soon achieved popularity, partly because the movable section of the chair could be kept at a comfortable angle without oscillating. The base of the platform rocker was often of considerable structural complexity, but this meant that the seating portion could be made of lighter material, such as bamboo.
