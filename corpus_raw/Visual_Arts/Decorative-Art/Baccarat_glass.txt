Baccarat glass,   glassware produced by an important glasshouse founded in 1765 at Baccarat, Fr. Originally a producer of soda glass for windows, tableware, and industrial uses, Baccarat was acquired by a Belgian manufacturer of lead crystal in 1817 and since then has specialized in producing this type of glass. In 1823 the firm won its first gold medal in an international exposition for glass, and a showing of its works at the 1925 Exposition des Arts Decoratifs helped shape the Art Deco style. Among the many artistically significant works it has produced are the pieces by Émile Gallé (q.v.).
Baccarat began production of paperweights in 1846. Although they exhibited virtually all techniques of ornamental glassmaking, including millefiori, cameo, sculpture, engraving, and casings, the Baccarat paperweights were relatively inexpensive and became great favourites with collectors. Today Baccarat manufactures many lines of tableware in historical patterns.
