Kurt Schwitters,  (born June 20, 1887, Hannover, Ger.—died  Jan. 8, 1948, Little Langdale, Westmorland, Eng.), German Dada artist and poet, best known for his collages and relief constructions.
Soon after World War I Schwitters was attracted by the emerging Dada school, a nihilistic literary and artistic movement dedicated to the destruction of existing aesthetic values. Denied membership in the Berlin circle of Dadaists, he formed his own variant in Hannover. He began to create compositions assembled from various everyday objects (train tickets, wooden spools, newspaper, string, cigarettes, and postage stamps). Similarly, his poems were composites of newspaper headlines, advertising slogans, and other printed ephemera. He referred to all of his artistic activities as Merz, a nonsense word derived from the second syllable of the word Kommerz (German: “commerce”). His collages were called Merzbilden (“Merz pictures”). Later, he also referred to all of his daily activities and even to himself by that name.
About 1920 Schwitters conceived the idea of building a cathedral of everyday objects. He built this three-dimensional assemblage, called Merzbau (“Merz building”), into his house in Hannover and continued to add to it for 16 years until there was little room left in the house for anything else. Unfortunately, it was destroyed during World War II.
In 1937, when the German government declared Schwitters’ art decadent, he moved to Norway, where he began a second Merzbau (destroyed by fire in 1951). With the German invasion of Norway in 1940, however, Schwitters was forced to escape to England. There, with the aid of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, he began work on the third Merzbau but died before completing it. Merzbau III is preserved at the University of Newcastle, Newcastle upon Tyne.
