Nishapur pottery,   Islāmic ceramics produced at Nishapur (modern Neyshābūr, Iran) that were of bold style and showed links with Sāssānian and Central Asian work. The style originated in Transoxania, an ancient district of Iran, during the 9th century ad and showed such specific characteristics as black and ochre birds with dashes of white and green. A rougher type portraying human and animal figures against an ornamental background also existed.
