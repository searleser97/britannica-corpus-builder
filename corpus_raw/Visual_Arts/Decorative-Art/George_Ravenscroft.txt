George Ravenscroft,  (baptized April 1633, Alconbury Weston, near Huntingdon, Huntingdonshire, England—died June 7, 1683), English glassmaker, developer of lead crystal (or flint glass). It was a heavy, blown type (shaped by blowing when in a plastic state) characterized by brilliance, clarity, and high refraction.
Ravenscroft was commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers to experiment with native raw materials for glass manufacture, because the members, dissatisfied with the quality of the glassware available, hoped to make England independent of foreign sources for both raw materials and finished glass.
In 1674 Ravenscroft obtained a seven-year patent for a glass with the desirable quality of a resemblance to rock crystal; this glass was made from a formula including transparent black flint (a hard mineral of the quartz family), which he called “flint crystalline.” Finding that his pieces tended to lose transparency within several months after manufacture, a defect known as “crizzling,” he added lead, usually in the form of red lead, producing a heavier, denser glass with darker colour and greatly increased refractive power, distinguished by the resonant ring produced when hollow glassware was flicked with the thumb and forefinger. To distinguish this product from the flawed earlier products, Ravenscroft marked pieces made by the later method with a small glass seal impressed with the raven’s head borne on his family coat of arms.
The new, solid, durable glass gradually achieved a greater market than the more fragile Venetian type, and new techniques, more suitable to the new glass, began to replace methods developed for Venetian glass. According to glass historian David C. Watts, Ravenscroft abandoned his patent in 1679, before its expiration, possibly because it was not then profitable. He joined John Bellingham at  the Vauxhall Glass Works (manufacturing plate glass) and worked there until his death in 1683.
