Chasing,   metalwork technique used to define or refine the forms of a surface design and to bring them to the height of relief required. The metal is worked from the front by hammering with various tools that raise, depress, or push aside the metal without removing any from the surface (except when the term chasing, instead of the more appropriate term chiselling, is used to describe the removal of surplus metal from objects after casting).
Chasing is the opposite of embossing, or repouss√©, in which the metal is worked from the back to give a higher relief. A particular form of chasing, called flat chasing, which involves hammering with small, blunt tools to give a low-relief ornamentation, was popular for silver decoration in Europe in the early 18th century and was widely used in the United States during the second half of the same century.
