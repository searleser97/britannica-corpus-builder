Louis Majorelle,  (born 1859, Toul, France—died  1926, Nancy), French artist, cabinetmaker, furniture designer, and ironworker who was one of the leading exponents of the Art Nouveau style.
The son of a cabinetmaker, Majorelle was trained as a painter and went in 1877 to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he studied under Jean-François Millet. After his father’s death in 1879, he returned to Nancy to manage the family workshop. Concentrating on the design of furniture, Majorelle moved from 18th-century reproductions to the developing style of Art Nouveau and began (1890) to produce works conceived in that style. While still adhering to the quality of hand craftsmanship, Majorelle maintained a modern workshop that incorporated both machine- and hand-labour in wood, marquetry, bronze, cabinetry, and sculpture. Thus, he increased production and decreased price, an achievement that accounts for his enormous success.
Majorelle’s catalogs between 1900 and 1914 show a tremendous output: suites of furniture for individual rooms, furniture using botanical motifs or other stylistic themes, and specific pieces whose prices ranged according to custom-ordered materials. Majorelle’s style incorporated a modified flowing line with polished woods, highlighted by Art Nouveau bronze mounts in the 18th-century tradition.
After World War I Majorelle continued to produce furniture in a modified, opulent Art Nouveau style, which by then was being replaced by the more severe Art Deco style. After his death Majorelle’s studio was managed by his pupil Alfred Lévy.
