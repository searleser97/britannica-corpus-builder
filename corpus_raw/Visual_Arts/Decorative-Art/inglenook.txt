Inglenook,  wooden seat or settle built into the space on either side of the wide fireplaces common in 17th-century English houses and cottages. The word is of Scottish origin, “ingle” meaning a housefire burning on a hearth. This type of built-in furniture fell out of favour upon the introduction of more sophisticated flues, which allowed for a smaller fire-burning area, but it was reintroduced with the revival of cottage-style architecture in the late 19th century, though in this context it was a deliberate reference to an idealized past.
