Paul de Lamerie,  (born April 9, 1688, ’s-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands—died August 1, 1751, London, England), well-known Dutch-born English silversmith.
De Lamerie’s parents were Huguenots who probably left France for religious reasons in the early 1680s. They had settled in Westminster by 1691. After serving as an apprentice to a London goldsmith, Pierre Platel, de Lamerie registered his mark and established his own shop in 1712. Early in his career he made simple vessels, such as tankards and teapots, in an unornamented Queen Anne style and more pretentious works, including a large wine cistern for the 1st earl of Gower (1719), in an ornamented style associated with the work of French Huguenot craftsmen.
In the 1730s de Lamerie produced works, particularly covered cups, in his version of the Rococo style. A notable example of 1737 is a cup whose handles are in the form of realistic snakes. A further example of his rich Rococo decoration is a ewer (1741), a vase-shaped pitcher, with a handle in the form of the figure of a triton. Unlike the silversmiths on the Continent, de Lamerie made many uncommissioned works that were intended to be stocked for later sale.
