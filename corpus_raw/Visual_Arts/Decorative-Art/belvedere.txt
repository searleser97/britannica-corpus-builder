Belvedere,   (Italian: “beautiful view”), architectural structure built in an elevated position to provide lighting and ventilation and to command a fine view. Roofed but open on one or more sides, a belvedere may be located in the upper part of a building or may stand as a separate structure. It often assumes the form of a loggia, or open gallery.
The belvedere has been used in Italy since the Renaissance; in the colder climate of northern Europe it is largely an architectural ornamentation. The term is sometimes applied to an entire building with a planned view, as the Belvedere gallery in the Vatican or the Belvedere palace in Vienna. The gazebo (q.v.) is a freestanding belvedere, usually open on all sides but often enclosed by wire screening.
