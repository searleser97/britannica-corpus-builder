Jamdani,  type of figured muslin characterized by an intricate, elaborate design that constitutes one of the greatest accomplishments of Bangladeshi weavers. The origins of figured muslin are not clear; it is mentioned in Sanskrit literature of the Gupta period (4th–6th century ce). It is known, however, that in the Mughal period (1526–1707) the finest jamdanis were produced at Dacca, in the state of Bengal (now Dhaka, Bangladesh). Because these textiles required great skill in their manufacture, they were costly and could be afforded by only the very rich.
A striking feature of jamdani muslins is the patterns of Persian derivation. The fabric is often a gray cotton ornamented with brightly coloured cotton and gold and silver wire. In saris, a characteristic garment worn by South Asian women, the corners are woven in patterns derived from shawls. The field is decorated with bunches of flowers suggestive of jasmine or with diagonally arranged circles.
