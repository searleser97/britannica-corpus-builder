Caftan, also spelled Kaftan,  man’s full-length garment of ancient Mesopotamian origin, worn throughout the Middle East. It is usually made of cotton or silk or a combination of the two.
A caftan has long, wide sleeves and is open in the front, although frequently it is bound with a sash. The word caftan (or gaberdine) also refers to a black frock coat worn by Ḥasidic Jews since the European Middle Ages. An ankle-length coatlike garment with wide sleeves became fashionable for women’s evening wear in the mid-20th century and was called a caftan.
