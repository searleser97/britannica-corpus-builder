Decorative art,   any of those arts that are concerned with the design and decoration of objects that are chiefly prized for their utility, rather than for their purely aesthetic qualities. Ceramics, glassware, basketry, jewelry, metalware, furniture, textiles, clothing, and other such goods are the objects most commonly associated with the decorative arts. Many decorative arts, such as basketry or pottery, are also commonly considered to be craft, but the definitions of both terms are arbitrary. It should also be noted that the separation of decorative arts from art forms such as painting and sculpture is a modern distinction.
The decorative arts are treated in several articles. For treatments of particular decorative arts, see basketry, enamelwork, floral decoration, furniture, glassware, interior design, lacquerwork, metalwork, mosaic, pottery, rug and carpet, stained glass, and tapestry. For a discussion of clothing and accessories, see dress and jewelry. For treatments of decorative arts in particular cultures, see art, African; arts, Central Asian; arts, East Asian; art and architecture, Egyptian; arts, Islamic; arts, Native American; art and architecture, Oceanic; arts, South Asian; and arts, Southeast Asian. See also folk art.
