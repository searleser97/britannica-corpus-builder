Ada group,   ivory carvings and a group of about 10 illuminated manuscripts, dating from the last quarter of the 8th century, the earliest examples of the art of the Court School of Charlemagne. The group is named after a Gospel book (c. 750; Trier, Cathedral Treasury) commissioned by Ada, supposed half sister of Charlemagne. These earliest manuscripts of the Carolingian period, which initiated a revival of Roman classicism, are clearly more monumental in conception and more ambitious in the treatment of the human figure than previous Hiberno-Saxon or Merovingian manuscripts; but, as can be seen in the Godescalc Gospels (c. 780; Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale), they continue traditions from these other arts in their basically linear presentation, with a lack of concern for volume and spatial relationships.
