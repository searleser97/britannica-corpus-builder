Chandelier,  a branched candleholder—or, in modern times, electric-light holder—suspended from the ceiling. Hanging candleholders made of wood or iron and simply shaped were used in Anglo-Saxon churches before the Norman Conquest (1066). In the 12th and 13th centuries huge openwork hoops of iron or bronze supported numerous prickets (spikes) for candles.
Brass chandeliers were made in the late European Middle Ages, mostly for churches. In the 18th century the Netherlands became known for its brass chandeliers, which had a boldly shaped baluster stem terminating in a large, burnished, reflecting sphere; from the stem sprang S-shaped branches ending in sockets.
In England and France fine chandeliers in silver and carved and gilded wood were made during the 18th century. The earliest English glass chandeliers date from the 1720s and were of plain design with a ball at the base. Eventually they became very elaborate, with glass icicles around the shaft and long cascades of pear-shaped drops. On the European continent the finest chandeliers were usually of rock crystal, but many glass chandeliers were made in Venice and Bohemia in the 18th century. Venetian chandeliers were known for their multicoloured glass and floral ornament.
