Point de France,   (French: “French lace”), the 17th-century school of French lace set up by Louis XIV’s minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert to curb the national extravagance in buying foreign lace. Colbert imported laceworkers from Venice and Flanders and settled them in and around centres where lace was already being made, such as Sedan and Alençon. In 1665 they were granted a monopoly for 10 years to produce lace that was artistically and financially competitive with imported varieties.
