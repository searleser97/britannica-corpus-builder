Ridgway ware,   type of Staffordshire pottery first produced by the brothers Job and George Ridgway in 1792 at the Bell Works at Shelton, Hanley, North Staffordshire, Eng. Despite family tensions, the Ridgways continued to produce their high-quality earthenware with blue printed designs well into the 20th century. The Ridgways made tea, dessert, and dinner services of a hard-wearing type of porcelain to compete with Minton ware, the designs of which they emulated as well as those of Worcester, Rockingham, and Spode.
