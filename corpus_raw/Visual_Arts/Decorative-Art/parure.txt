Parure,   matched set of jewelry consisting of such pieces as earrings, bracelet, brooch, necklace, and ring. By the mid-17th century, jewels had ceased to be created as individual works of art expressing some idea or fancy and had instead become mere personal ornaments that were beautiful but lacking in any deeper significance. Consequently, as the forms of jewels tended to become stereotyped, the matching set of jewels, or parure, became the dominant style in jewelry.
In about 1700, parures consisted of earrings, brooch, necklace or clasp, ring, and sometimes shoulder brooches or buckles, all set with diamonds, either alone or in combination with rubies, topazes, sapphires, or emeralds. In the 18th century the kings of France had parures of great splendour, most made of diamonds and including shoe buckles, coat decorations, insignia, and sword hilts. For state occasions, the 19th-century Napoleonic court imitated the parures of the ancien r√©gime, with the addition of a jeweled coronet of classic form. Parures of semiprecious stones were made for everyday wear and for the less affluent. Parures continue to be a staple element in jewelry design.
