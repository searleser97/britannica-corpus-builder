Faience parlante,   (French: “talking faience”), in French pottery, popular utilitarian 18th-century earthenware, principally plates, jugs, and bowls, that had inscriptions as part of its decoration. The city of Nevers was the outstanding centre for the production of faience parlante. The range of inscriptions included owners’ names, coats of arms, bacchic or facetious references, Masonic and trade emblems, quotations from songs and proverbs, urban views, allegorical designs, and commemorative themes.
There were several subgenres of faience parlante. One type, faience patronymique, had pictures of saints and a date and was frequently given as a gift on birthdays or christenings. Faience patriotique was decorated with themes drawn from the French Revolution or from other national political events. Early examples of faience patriotique were decorated with the Royalist fleur-de-lis, while later ones displayed Republican phrases and symbols. Though produced in vast numbers, faience patriotique has inspired many forgeries and replicas, perhaps because of its historical associations.
