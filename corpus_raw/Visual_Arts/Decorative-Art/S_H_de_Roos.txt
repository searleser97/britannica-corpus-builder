S.H. de Roos, in full Sjoerd Hendrik De Roos,  (born Sept. 14, 1877, Drachten, Neth.—died April 2, 1962, Haarlem), book and type designer who was an important figure in the private-press movement in the Netherlands.
De Roos studied lithography at the Royal Academy of Art, Amsterdam. Among his early activities were furniture design and the design of decorations for tin containers. His first book design was for Kunst en Maatschappij (1903; “Art and Society”), a translation of a collection of the writings of the English poet and designer William Morris, whose Kelmscott Press was the beginning of the private-press movement in England. In 1907 Roos joined the Typefoundry Amsterdam, where he remained until he retired in 1942. About 1928 he founded the Heuvel Press, at Hilversum, the second private press in the Netherlands, for which he designed Meidoorn type. Of the four books printed by Heuvel, the edition of Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s Hand and Soul (1929) is considered particularly fine.
Among the typefaces designed by de Roos are Holland Medieval (1912), Zilvertype (1915), Egmont (1933), and De Roos Roman (1947).
