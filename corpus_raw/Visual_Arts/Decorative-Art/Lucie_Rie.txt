Dame Lucie Rie, née Lucie Gomperz,  (born March 16, 1902, Vienna, Austria—died April 1, 1995, London, England), Austrian-born British studio potter. Her unique and complex slip-glaze surface treatment and inventive kiln processing influenced an entire generation of younger British ceramists.
Rie was educated at the Vienna Gymnasium and at the Arts and Crafts School. Her early ceramics incorporate late Neoclassicism, Jugendstil, modernism, and Japonism. She settled in England in 1938 and, in order to survive during World War II, produced and sold fine ceramic buttons. In 1947 she was joined in her studio by the German-born Hans Coper.
Rie had her first solo show as a potter in 1949, was in the Arts Council Retrospective of 1967, showed with Coper in Rotterdam in 1967 and Hamburg in 1972, and was given major exhibitions in Düsseldorf, West Germany, in 1978, and in London at Sainsbury Place and the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1981–82. She was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1991.
