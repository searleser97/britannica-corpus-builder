Rustic ware,   in pottery, creations of the French potter Bernard Palissy, who from about 1548 produced large earthenware dishes decorated with naturalistic pictures of reptiles, insects, and the like in high relief. The wares were coloured with lead glazes that enhanced the lifelike quality of the decorative motifs. Rustic ware was imitated by potters in France, Portugal, and England.
