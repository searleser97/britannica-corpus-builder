Senneh rug, Senneh also spelled Senna or Sehna,  handwoven floor covering made by Kurds who live in or around the town of Senneh (now more properly Sanandaj) in western Iran. The pile rugs and kilims of Senneh are prized for their delicate pattern and colouring and for their fine weave. They are by far the most sophisticated of the Kurdish rugs. The designs usually involve some repeat pattern, or diaper, such as the herāti, in which a diamond lattice pattern peeps through a tangle of blossoms and leaves or through intricate versions of the boteh, a leaf with curling tip. The entire field may show such a pattern, or a medallion scheme may introduce a hexagonal centerpiece and straight-arched ends. The borders are full of fine detail, often featuring paired arabesques known in the trade as “turtles.”
The finely woven Senneh kilims are slit tapestries of the highest quality. Their small-scale borders are carried around the ends, as they are typically in pile carpets but rarely in such weavings. Senneh seems to have been a favourite place of manufacture for saddle cloths, those in pile usually provided with a two-slope arch. Although the town of Senneh has given its name to the asymmetrical Persian knot, it is the Turkish, or symmetrical, knot, that is actually used there.
