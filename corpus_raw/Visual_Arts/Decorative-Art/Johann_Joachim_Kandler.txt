Johann Joachim Kändler,  (born 1706, Fischbach, Saxony [Germany]—died  May 18, 1775, Meissen), late Baroque sculptor who was a major innovator in European porcelain sculpture.
In 1731 Kändler—a sculptor at the court of the elector of Saxony, Frederick Augustus I (King Augustus II of Poland)—was engaged to reorganize the modeling department of the porcelain factory at Meissen. He lent his great talents to the factory for a period of 44 years. His versatility and imagination were extraordinary, and it was largely through his genius that the Meissen factory gained world renown.
Kändler was ably assisted in design and execution by three of the most distinguished pottery sculptors of the Rococo period, J.F. Eberlein, F.E. Meyer, and P. Reinicke. Scarcely a palace in Europe did not contain Meissen figurines, dinner sets, vases, or other works of the Kändler period. Among his best-known works are his commedia dell’arte figurines, largely done between 1738 and 1740; his birds for the Japanese Palace in Dresden, executed between 1731 and 1735; and the 2,200-piece Swan Service made for Heinrich, Count von Brühl, from 1737 to 1741.
