Toutin, Jean,  (born 1578, Châteaudun, Eure-et-Loire, France—died June 14, 1644, Paris), French enamelworker who was one of the first artists to make enamel portrait miniatures.
Although the art of enamelwork was hundreds of years old, Toutin developed a revolutionary new technique for enamel painting. He discovered that coloured enamels, when applied to a previously fired white enamel ground, would not run together when the piece was refired. Existing enamel techniques had relied on small bands of gold to separate the colours or small surface indentations to prevent pigments from blending during firing. Toutin’s method enabled the artist to apply enamel to a surface almost as paint is applied to canvas. It also permitted the use of a wider range of colours. Thus was gained the precision of colour and detail that made possible miniature portraits in enamel.
The new procedure was laborious, but the works of Toutin proved popular with French royalty and courtiers. Students came from other parts of the Continent to learn the technique, and Toutin’s art thus spread throughout Europe. It was a particular success in England, where the Swiss-born enamelworkers Jean Pettitot and Jacques Bordier moved after studying with the French master.
Perhaps the most popular of Toutin’s work was his highly elaborate enameled watchcases, in great demand at the court of King Louis XIII, where Toutin produced enameled miniatures of virtually every member of the French royal family. None of Toutin’s work survives today. His son Henri was also a noted enamelworker.
