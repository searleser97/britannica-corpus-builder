John Cobb,  (born c. 1710—died  1778), English cabinetmaker whose work was once overshadowed by that of Thomas Chippendale but who is now regarded as being among England’s greatest furniture makers.
He was in partnership (c. 1750–65) with William Vile, their firm becoming one of the most important among London’s cabinetmakers. While Vile created works in an Anglicized Rococo style, Cobb’s furniture of the 1770s was executed in an elegant Neoclassical style. Vile retired in 1765, and Cobb continued alone until his death. Up to 1765 the firm supplied furniture to King George III of England, but after Vile’s retirement Cobb apparently ceased work for royalty. The firm’s records are rare, but a ledger from Edgcote House, Northamptonshire, notes payment to them of more than £1,000 in 1758, and Cobb supplied, in 1770, furniture to the English connoisseur and man of letters Horace Walpole.
An identified group of Cobb’s pieces closely follows the style of the famous Neoclassical designer Robert Adam. A bill dated 1772 shows that Cobb supplied the marquetried commode with gilt bronze mounts and pair of vase stands at Corsham Court, Wiltshire; a similar commode in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, may also be his. A colourful and proud individual, he was admired by King George. Among the masterpieces he and Vile created for the crown are the superb mahogany jewel cabinet (1761) inlaid with ivory for Queen Charlotte and a secretaire (1761), now at Buckingham Palace, London. Affluent as well as artistically successful, Cobb owned houses in St. Martin’s Lane (then London’s cabinetmaking centre) and in fashionable Highgate and Islington. His last will (1776) revealed a personal fortune in his company’s stock of £22,000.
