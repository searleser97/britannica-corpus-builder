Grinling Gibbons,  (born April 4, 1648, Rotterdam, Neth.—died  Aug. 3, 1721, London, Eng.), British wood-carver known for his decorative woodwork and for much stone ornamentation at Blenheim and Hampton Court palaces and at St. Paul’s Cathedral.
After a childhood in the Netherlands, where his English father had settled, Gibbons went to England and took up residence in Deptford, where by 1671 he had made a name as a wood-carver. Called to decorate Charles II’s new royal apartments at Windsor Castle, he continued such work for William and Mary at Kensington Palace and Hampton Court, winning appointment as master carver in 1693. At St. Paul’s Cathedral he carved choir stalls, thrones, and a great organ screen (removed in 1860); for the exterior he carved most of the stone panels below the lower windows. Well-known examples of Gibbons’ work include a wooden reredos (ornamental screen behind a church altar) and organ case and a marble font in St. James’s Church in London (designed by Christopher Wren) and a carved room at Petworth House, Sussex (see photograph).
