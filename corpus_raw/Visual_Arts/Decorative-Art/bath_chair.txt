Bath chair,   chair on wheels intended for use by ladies and invalids. It was devised by James Heath, of Bath, Eng., about 1750. For the next three-quarters of a century it rivaled the sedan chair and ultimately superseded it as a form of conveyance in Great Britain. The most common variety was supported on two wheels joined by an axle beneath the seat, with a small pivoting wheel in front supporting the footrest.
The chair could be pushed from behind and steered by a long curved rod connected to the front wheel and controlled by the occupant. The whole conveyance was designed on flowing lines. The bath chair was especially popular during Victorian times, when it was used at seaside resorts.
