Kayseri rug,  floor covering handwoven in or around the city of Kayseri in central Turkey. The best-known rugs from this district are those produced in the 20th century, largely for sale to tourists and undiscriminating collectors.
Free imitations of Ghiordes, Persian, or Cairene designs, they are carried out in wool, silk, mercerized cotton, or, more recently, rayon. Inscriptions appearing in these rugs are usually unreadable.
