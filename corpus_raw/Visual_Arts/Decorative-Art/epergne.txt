Epergne,   dining table centrepiece—usually of silver—that generally sits on four feet supporting a central bowl and four or more dishes held by radiating branches and used to serve pickles, fruits, nuts, sweetmeats, and other small items. Occasionally, epergnes have additional holders for candles, casters, or cruets.
The earliest record of an epergne is in 1725, and extant pieces date from the 1730s. In the late 19th century similar pieces, made largely of glass or porcelain and intended to hold flowers, came into fashion.
