Holbein rug,  any of several types of 15th- to 17th-century Anatolian floor coverings, the patterns of which appear in paintings by the German painter Hans Holbein the Younger (1497/8–1593). The best-known of these have, in diagonal rows, small octagons with interlaced outlines and a group of concentric arabesques.
A different series, probably made in another area, have fields subdivided into rectangular panels, each of which may include an octagonal medallion form. The first type has been attributed by some writers to Uşak; the second to the Bergama district (both in Turkey).
