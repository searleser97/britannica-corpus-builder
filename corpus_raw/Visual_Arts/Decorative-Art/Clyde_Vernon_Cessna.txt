Clyde Vernon Cessna,  (born Dec. 5, 1879, Hawthorne, Iowa, U.S.—died  Nov. 20, 1954, near Rago, Kan.), American aviator and aircraft manufacturer who invented the cantilever wing and a V-shaped tail configuration and whose dedication to a simple, flexible monoplane design made his planes, such as variations on the model 180, popular as bush aircraft and as forest and rescue planes.
Cessna worked as a farmhand, prospector, threshing-machine operator, and automobile salesman until he saw a flying circus in Oklahoma and decided to be a flyer. He worked at an airplane factory in the Bronx, New York City, for two months and returned to Oklahoma, where he flew his first plane in 1911. In 1917 he produced a monoplane powered by a 6-cylinder, air-cooled engine. In the 1920s he joined forces with businessman and air enthusiast Victor Roos to produce Cessna-Roos aircraft until 1927. Then Cessna bought out the company, which was closed (1931–34) during the Great Depression. Cessna retired in 1934. A revived Cessna Aircraft Company later became one of the world’s largest manufacturers of private airplanes. In 1992 the company was acquired by Textron, Inc.
