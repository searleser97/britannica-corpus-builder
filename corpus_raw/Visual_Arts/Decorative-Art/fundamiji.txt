Fundamiji, (Japanese: “dusted base”, ) also called Kinji, orKindami,  in Japanese lacquerwork, variation of the jimaki technique. In this kind of ground decoration, a thick layer of fine gold or silver grains is dusted onto a freshly lacquered surface and, when dry, covered with a clear lacquer. After this has dried, it is polished with powdered charcoal and given a fine finish by fingertip polishing with a mixture of linseed oil and finely powdered mudstone. When completed, the surface resembles burnished gold or silver plate.
Fine, round grains of gold or silver (maruko) are usually used for fundamiji. Maruko can be produced by lightly grinding gold or silver flakes between two filelike steel surfaces. A sieve is used to separate the fine grains from the coarse. During the Heian period (794–1185), uneven grains of gold produced by filing solid gold were used; this technique was called ikakeji.
