Cairene rug,  Egyptian floor covering believed to have been made in or near Cairo from at least as early as the 15th century to the 18th. The early production, under the Mamlūk dynasty, is characterized by geometric, centralized schemes featuring large and complex star shapes, octagons, or polygonal centerpieces, subdivided and graced with a multitude of tiny radial or clustered forms. Presumably, those in six colours are earlier, for the palette was reduced to three in later production.
Old records indicate that many large, long carpets were produced, but, with several exceptions such as one magnificent silk carpet (Austrian Museum for Applied Art, Vienna), those that have survived are usually small, with cross panels toward both ends. The Ottoman conquest resulted in a variety of transitional designs and ultimately in a large production of floral rugs in the Ottoman manner, many with systems of circular medallions. Both Mamlūk and Ottoman Cairene rugs seem to have been exported in large numbers to southern Europe, where most of the known examples were found, including a few cruciform rugs for use on tables.
