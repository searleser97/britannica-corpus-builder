Buta,   (Hindi-Urdu: “flower”), one of the most important ornamental motifs of Mughal Indian art, consisting of a floral spray with stylized leaves and flowers. It is used in architecture and painting and in textiles, enamels, and almost all other decorative arts.
The motif began to gain importance in the reign of the Mughal emperor Jahāngīr (1605–27), and by the time of Shah Jahān (1628–58) it was in constant use. In the Taj Mahal (c. 1632– c. 1649), at Agra, are examples of great delicacy and beauty of colour. The motif tended to become stiff and inert by the 18th century, but its popularity never declined.
