Thuluth script,  in calligraphy, medieval Islamic style of handwritten alphabet. Thuluth (Arabic: “one-third”) is written on the principle that one-third of each letter slopes. It is a large and elegant, cursive script, used in medieval times on mosque decorations. It took on some of the functions of the early Kūfic script; it was used to write sura (Qurʾānic chapter) headings, religious inscriptions, and princely titles and epigraphs. It was also used for many of the large copies of the Qurʾān produced from the 13th century.
