Bilston enamelware,   enameled products made in Bilston, Eng., which was one of the most prolific centres of enameling in the 18th century. A large number of enamelers worked in Bilston decorating small objects primarily by the transfer printing process. Bilston enamelware is often technically brilliant, displaying a great range of colours and ornament. It lacks, however, the finesse of Battersea enamelware, produced in London between 1753 and 1756. It remains impossible to distinguish between the products of the various Bilston enterprises.
