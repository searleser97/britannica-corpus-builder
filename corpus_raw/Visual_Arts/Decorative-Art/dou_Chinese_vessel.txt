Dou, Wade-Giles romanization tou,  type of ancient Chinese bronze vessel used to contain food. The dou is usually a circular bowl supported on a short stem rising from a flaring base. The rim has two ring-shaped handles at opposite sides of the bowl, and another shallow bowl serves as a lid.
While there may be a predecessor among Neolithic (c. 5000–2000 bc) pottery forms, the bronze dou was popular principally during the middle and, especially, late Zhou dynasty (c. 900–256/255 bc). During the Zhou period, its surface decoration was richly patterned and embellished.
