Collage,   (French: “pasting”), artistic technique of applying manufactured, printed, or “found” materials, such as bits of newspaper, fabric, wallpaper, etc., to a panel or canvas, frequently in combination with painting. In the 19th century, papiers collés were created from papers cut out and put together to form decorative compositions. In about 1912–13 Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque extended this technique, combining fragments of paper, wood, linoleum, and newspapers with oil paint on canvas to form subtle and interesting abstract or semiabstract compositions. The development of the collage by Picasso and Braque contributed largely to the transition from Analytical to Synthetic Cubism.
The word collage was first used to refer to works by Dada and Surrealist artists, especially Max Ernst. His collages were composed of old engravings and prints that had been skillfully cut and pasted together to form disquietingly irrational images. Kurt Schwitters’ collages utilized pieces of string, rags, wood, wire, nails, and papers. Henri Matisse’s imaginative papiers découpés, the works of his last years, were an adaptation of the collage technique. The American artist Joseph Cornell expanded upon the collage technique in his intimate, mysterious shadow boxes. In the 1960s collage was employed as a major form of Pop art. The Pop-art collage was brought to its high point in the 1960s by Robert Rauschenberg, who combined newspaper and magazine photographs with silk-screen printing to produce images that are amalgams of American history and popular culture.
