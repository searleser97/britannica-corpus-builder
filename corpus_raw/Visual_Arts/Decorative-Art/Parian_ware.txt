Parian ware,   porcelain introduced about 1840 by the English firm of Copeland & Garrett, in imitation of SÃ¨vres biscuit (fired but unglazed porcelain). Its name is derived from its resemblance to Parian marble. 
A great many figures, some extremely large, were made in this medium. Most of them consist of either sentimental subjects or quasi-erotic nudes, which were popular in Victorian art. In the United States, Parian ware was manufactured by Norton and Fenton.
