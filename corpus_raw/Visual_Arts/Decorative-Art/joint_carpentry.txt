Joint,  in carpentry, junction of two or more members of a framed structure. Joinery, or the making of wooden joints, is one of the principal functions of the carpenter and cabinetmaker. Wood, being a natural material, is not uniform in quality, and moisture, present in the tree during growth, is uneven in cut wood. Wood used for building is subject to movement caused by changes in its moisture content. Though such movement is frequently quite small and accurately predictable, it remains a critical consideration in joint design. Because wood has been used as a building material for centuries throughout the world, the designs of most joints were perfected hundreds of years ago and have changed little since that time.
The object of the joint is to fix two members together so that the joint has the greatest possible mechanical strength and is as unobtrusive as possible. Though there are many joints in use, they fall into a few basic groups, many being variations and elaborations on fundamentally simple ideas. Practically all are based on handwork, and with few exceptions most machine-made joints follow the traditional patterns; most joints rely to a considerable extent on a combination of mechanical fit and glue for their strength. Common types of joints include the dovetail, used for joining two flat members together at right angles, as in the sides of a drawer; the dowelled joint, in which dowelling is employed to impart mechanical strength; and the mortise and tenon, used to join a horizontal member with the vertical member of a frame.
