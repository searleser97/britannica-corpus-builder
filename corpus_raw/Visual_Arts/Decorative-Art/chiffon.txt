Chiffon,   in textiles, lightweight, sheer fabric of plain weave, usually of silk or one of the synthetic fibres. Although delicate in appearance, it is a relatively strong, balanced fabric and can be dyed or printed for use in dresses, millinery, scarves, and lampshades. The word chiffon is also used as a modifier to mean a lightweight or softly draping conditionâ€”e.g., chiffon velvet and chiffon taffeta.
In Romania chiffon is a bleached cotton shirting. In Germany and Austria it is a stout, fine, plainwoven linen fabric of smooth finish, used for making shirts and underwear.
