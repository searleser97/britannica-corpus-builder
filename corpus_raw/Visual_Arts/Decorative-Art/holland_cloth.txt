Holland,  plainwoven unbleached or dull-finish linen used as furniture covering or a cotton fabric that is made more or less opaque by a glazed or unglazed finish (called the Holland finish), consisting of oil and a filling material. Originally the name was applied to any fine, plainwoven linens imported from the continent of Europe, and especially to the product obtained from the Netherlands.
Holland is used for window shades, insulation, labels and tags, sign cloth, and the like. In Greece a number of coloured cotton fabrics are also known as hollands.
