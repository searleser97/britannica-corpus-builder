Khirqah,  (Arabic: “rag”), a woolen robe traditionally bestowed by Sufi (Muslim mystic) masters on those who had newly joined the Sufi path, in recognition of their sincerity and devotion. While most sources agree that the khirqah was a patched piece of cloth, there is no uniform description of the colour or shape. Some described it as a blue woolen robe, and, since blue is the colour of mourning, it signified the rejection of worldly pleasure. Others described it as white for purity.
The khirqah was a sign of faqr (poverty) and symbolized the devotee’s vow to abandon the earthly world and to devote himself entirely to the love of God. It took three years of good work under the supervision of the sheikh (Sufi master) for a novice to obtain the khirqah, which was then bestowed upon him in a special ceremony to mark his “entering upon the way of Truth.”
There were different types of khirqah. The khirqat al-irādah (“robe of will”) was given to those who entered the Sufi path fully aware of the difficult duties that they must undertake and prepared to accept and obey without question the sheikh’s orders. The khirqat at-tabarruk (“robe of benediction”), which was inferior to the former, was given to those whom the sheikh felt had the potential of surviving the tests that eventually would lead to their acceptance in the Sufi brotherhood, even if they did not yet know the full meaning of wearing the khirqah.
Many Sufis rejected the idea of a universal attire as unnecessary. All Sufis agree that a real seeker of truth is known by his ḥarqah (inner flame), and that the khirqah is merely a symbol that should not be overvalued.
