Peachblow glass,   American art glass made in the latter part of the 19th century by factories such as the Mount Washington Glass Works of New Bedford, Mass., and the New England Glass Company of East Cambridge, Mass. The name is derived from a Chinese porcelain glaze called “peach-bloom.” Peachblow is made with either a shiny or a mat finish. Its colours range from bluish white or cream to violet red or pink. The glass is sometimes made with a milk-white lining.
