Lille lace,   bobbin-made lace made since the 16th century in the town of Lille, formerly in Flanders but now in northwestern France. It was notable for its very fine net background, with a hexagonal mesh in which the thread was twisted, rather than plaited. The net was often scattered with small square dots. Patterns were of conventional curving flowers and scrolls. Lille lace was much sought after at the end of the 18th century.
