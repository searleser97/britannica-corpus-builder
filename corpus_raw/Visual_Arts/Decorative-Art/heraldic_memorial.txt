Heraldic memorial,  commemorative work of art decorated with the armorial bearings of the deceased. Memorials, whether in the form of stained-glass windows, effigies, monumental brasses, or tablets on church walls and in graveyards, provide an heraldic education of great value, contributing to the study of both history and art.
Two types of heraldic memorial are especially notable. The first is the stone slab customary on the continent of Europe. An achievement of arms (representation of shield, helmet, crest, mantling, etc.) generally covers the slab, which also may bear a Gothic tracery design; the inscription either surrounds the edge of the slab or is placed above or beneath the arms. The second type of memorial is the hatchment, in which England and Belgium are particularly rich.
