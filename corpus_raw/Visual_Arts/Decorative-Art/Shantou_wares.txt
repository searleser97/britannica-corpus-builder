Shantou wares, Wade-Giles romanization Swatow,  various types of porcelain produced mostly in Fujian province, southeastern China, during the 16th and 17th centuries. Most pieces were exported to Japan, Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East; some went to the European market. At one time it was believed that this porcelain was shipped from the port of Shantou, but contemporary records do not support this theory. Most pieces were large plates and bowls, decorated in underglaze blue, although some were decorated with overglaze red, green, and turquoise, and there was also a limited use of black. The decoration was loosely drawn, with an uninhibited, spontaneous quality that appeals to the modern eye.
