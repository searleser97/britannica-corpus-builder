Honiton lace,   bobbin lace made in England at Honiton, Devonshire, from the 17th century. By Honiton most people, however, mean the lace made there in the 19th century in which strong floral motifs are joined to a net (often spotted) background. The finest pieces have a fresh, easy naturalism that can be very attractive, but generally the designs are somewhat incoherent and have a less professional look than the similar Belgian laces.
