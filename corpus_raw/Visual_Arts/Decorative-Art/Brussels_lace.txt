Brussels lace,  lace named for the city of Brussels. It became distinguished from other bobbin laces made in Flanders during the second half of the 17th century. Brussels laces were of high quality, popular at court, and made professionally at workshops called béguinages (often associated with convents) by unmarried women whose lives were dedicated to the work. The laces were of the non-continuous-thread technique, the richly delicate designs near-naturalistic, almost weightless, and at times breathtakingly beautiful. The ground could be a meshwork of drochel (hexagonal forms) or bars or a mixture of the two. Through the 19th century the laces became heavier, and the designs, though still beautiful, became rather crowded, frequently sprinkled with numerous dots and flourishes in keeping with the taste of the period.
The name Brussels came to include application laces and embroidered nets. From roughly 1720 a very fine, lightweight needle lace was made, in appearance like a very opulent Alençon lace, the stitches so minute that in some examples 10,000 can be counted per square inch. Examples are rare, but in 1851 needle lace was revived in the form of the immediately popular point de gaze, made of fine-quality cotton thread. Its packed designs incorporated roses with tiered petals, and its caskets of jewel-like filling stitches made it the prime choice for court wear and other special occasions. It was succeeded after World War I by the much heavier point de Venise, used mostly for table mats and runners. The quality of the bobbin laces also deteriorated as the costs of manufacture soared. A bolder bobbin lace, sometimes with needle-lace inclusions, of variable quality and known as duchesse was made in both Brussels and Brugge and was fashionable for collars and even dresses until the 1930s.
