Dhoti,   long loincloth traditionally worn in southern Asia by Hindu men. Wrapped around the hips and thighs with one end brought between the legs and tucked into the waistband, the dhoti resembles baggy, knee- length trousers.
The lightweight cotton fabric, also called dhoti, that is used for the garment is usually white and is often bordered in brightly coloured stripes. It was originally called a paridhana. Sculptured reliefs dating from the 2nd century bc show the ancient dhoti as a garment worn by both sexes. Derivatives of the dhoti are the panung of Thailand, the comboy of Sri Lanka, and the sarong of Indonesia and Malaysia.
