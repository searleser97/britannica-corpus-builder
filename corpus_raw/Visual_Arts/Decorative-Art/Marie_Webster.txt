Marie Webster, née Marie Daugherty,  (born July 19, 1859, Wabash, Indiana, U.S.—died August 29, 1956, Princeton, New Jersey), American quilt designer and historian, author of the first book entirely devoted to American quilts.
Marie Daugherty was educated at local schools in Wabash, Indiana. Unable to attend college because of an eye ailment, she was tutored in Latin and Greek and read widely. She was married to George Webster in 1884, and the couple settled in Marion, Indiana.
The January 1, 1911, issue of Ladies’ Home Journal featured four floral appliqué quilts designed by Webster, a housewife in her 50s who previously had done needlework only for pleasure. Her quilts were so distinctive—and so popular—that 10 more designs were published in the next three years. They often featured pastel colorations and motifs that paid artistic homage to two current trends in the decorative arts, the Colonial Revival and the Arts and Crafts movement. In her 1915 best-seller, Quilts: Their Story and How to Make Them, America’s first book dedicated to quilt history, Webster wrote, “The work of the old-time quilters possesses artistic merit to a very high degree.”
Webster gave many quilt lectures dressed in an Early American-style costume of green silk. Her Practical Patchwork Company (1921–42) sold patterns, kits, and finished quilts from her designs. The family home in Marion, Indiana, is now the headquarters of the Quilters Hall of Fame, founded by Hazel Carter in 1979. Webster was inducted in 1991.
