Duck,   (from Dutch doek, “cloth”), any of a broad range of strong, durable, plainwoven fabrics made originally from tow yarns and subsequently from either flax or cotton. Duck is lighter than canvas or sailcloth and differs from these in that it is almost invariably single in both warp and weft, or filling.
The fabric, in its various qualities and colours, is used for an enormous variety of goods, including tents, wagon and motor hoods, light sails, belting, mailbags and other bags and pocketings, and clothing; the plural form is used colloquially for trousers made of the material. Russian duck is a fine white linen canvas.
