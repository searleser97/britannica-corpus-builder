Rya rug,  floor covering handmade in Sweden and Finland using techniques resembling those employed in Oriental carpets but having extremely long, recumbent pile and great flexibility. In one Swedish type the nap is produced by symmetrical knots that include a third warp, the fabric having been made on a cloth loom with open shed. Early examples of rya rugs, which were intended for use as bedspreads, have pile in uncut loops, and some also have pile at the back for greater warmth. Some ryas combine pile with surface areas in other weaving techniques or vary the technique or colour of the weft areas that lie between the rows of pile.
Originally, the ryas seem to have been patternless or striped. After a period of relative complexity in which designs of a folk-art character were used, recent weavings again are simpler, with greater accent placed upon textures.
