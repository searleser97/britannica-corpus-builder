Canton enamel,   Chinese painted enamel, so named for the principal place of its manufacture, Canton. Painted-enamel techniques were originally developed in Limoges, Fr., from about 1470. These techniques were introduced into China in the 18th century, probably by French missionaries. This is reflected in the translation of the Chinese term for painted enamels, “foreign porcelain.” A metal object, usually copper but sometimes silver or gold, is covered with a background layer of enamel (often white), is fired, and then is painted with coloured enamels much as are porcelains. The finished piece is then fired again.
A thriving industry for the manufacture and export of Canton enamels grew up in the 18th century. More refined enamels made in the emperor’s workshops and in private shops in Peking also became popular export items. Most of the Canton enamels used the famille rose colours peculiar to Europe. Some of this “foreign porcelain” became the medium for humour and satire, often caricaturing foreigners. The quality of Canton enamels began to deteriorate at the end of the 18th century, but they were still made in large numbers during the 19th century.
