Kyō-yaki,   decorated Japanese ceramics produced in Kyōto from about the middle of the 17th century. The development of this ware was stimulated by the appearance of enamelled porcelains in Kyushu, and it was not long after Sakaida Kakiemon successfully perfected overglaze enamels in Arita that Nonomura Ninsei also began production in Kyōto. Kyō-yaki contrasted with the enamelled wares of Arita that had been heavily influenced by Chinese models and produced with an eye to foreign export; instead, the Kyōto wares are in the classical Japanese style, retaining much of the traditional taste of the court.
A wide variety of tableware, tea utensils, and ornamental objects were produced. Many of these were formed on the wheel and have fine, classically proportioned walls. Pictorial motifs are painted in the style of both the Kanō school and Yamato-e traditions. A wide range of colors (red, blue, yellow, green, purple, black, silver, and gold) is used to create complex tonal harmonies.
