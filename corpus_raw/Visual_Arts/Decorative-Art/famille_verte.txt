Famille verte, (French: “green family”)  group of Chinese porcelain wares characterized by decoration painted in a colour range that includes yellow, blue, red, purple, and green, the latter sometimes used for the ground. The verte palette that uses a yellow ground is famille jaune; the palette that uses a rich greenish black ground is famille noire. Famille verte ware was made largely during the Kangxi period (1661–1722) of the Qing dynasty.
