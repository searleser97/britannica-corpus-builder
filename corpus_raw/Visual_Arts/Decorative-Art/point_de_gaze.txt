Point de gaze,   (French: “gauze lace”), needle lace produced in Brussels, principally from 1851 to around 1900, though in the late 20th century it was still being produced for the tourist trade. It was the last of the great laces to be developed. Its gauzy appearance is the result of a delicate, needle-made mesh, created with one continuous thread forming a network of semicircular loops. In the solid parts of the design, shading is achieved by a combination of close and open stitches. The characteristic flowers sometimes have detached petals.
