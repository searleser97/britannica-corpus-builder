Queen Anne style,  style of decorative arts that began to evolve during the rule of King William III of England, reached its primacy during the reign of Queen Anne (1702–14), and persisted after George I ascended the throne. The period also has been called “the age of walnut” because that wood was used almost exclusively in English furniture of the time, replacing oak.
The single most distinctive feature of Queen Anne furniture is the use of the cabriole leg, which is shaped in the form of a double curve—the upper part being convex and the lower part concave—and ends either in a claw-and-ball or paw foot. The Queen Anne chair is identifiable as well for the splat back, which is curved in order to fit the hollow of the spine.
The custom of social tea drinking that developed in the Queen Anne period produced a need for small movable chairs and tables, as well as for china cabinets. Bookcases and secretaries were also designed in the Queen Anne style. Marquetry, inlay, veneering, and lacquerwork were all skillfully applied to the decorative furniture of Queen Anne design. Typical motifs in this ornamentation are scallop shells, scrolls, Oriental figures, animals, and plants. The Queen Anne style of furniture design became extremely popular among the upper classes in Britain’s North American colonies.
Though also known as Queen Anne, the red brick architectural style of the 1870s in Great Britain and the United States had no real connection with the original Queen Anne period.
