Wainscot,  interior paneling in general and, more specifically, paneling that covers only the lower portion of an interior wall or partition. It has a decorative or protective function and is usually of wood, although tile and marble have at times been popular. The molding along the upper edge is called a wainscot cap and may serve as a chair rail.
Traditionally, British wainscot was made of oak—imported from Russia, Germany, or Holland—and wainscot oak remains a term for select, quartersawn oak for paneling. A typical use of wainscot appears in early English Renaissance mansions where oak paneling to a height of 8 or 10 feet (2.5 to 3 m) was installed and hung with paintings or armour. The French equivalent for wainscot is boiserie. The latter term’s use is generally reserved, however, for the profusely decorated paneling, often carved in low relief, of the 17th and 18th centuries in France. Boiserie commonly covers the wall up to the ceiling and may also be painted, gilded, or, in some instances, inlaid.
