Verre églomisé,   (French: “Glomyized glass”), glass engraved on the back that has been covered by unfired painting or, usually, gold or silver leaf. The method owes its name to Jean-Baptiste Glomy (d. 1786), a French picture framer who used the process in glass mounts.
The technique derives from late antiquity and was transmitted by the Early Christian tradition. It has been revived at different periods in the history of glass: in Italy during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries; in Holland and Spain during the 17th and 18th centuries; and in France, England, and the United States in the 18th century.
Usually executed on a panel of glass (for a picture frame, for example) backed with gold or silver leaf, the technique involves engraving a design through the leaf and applying coloured pigment so that the coloured portions show through the engraved areas. The painting is in turn backed with protective glass or foil. Some late 18th-century examples depicting views of Holland can be assigned to a Dutch engraver signing himself simply “Zeuner.” During the same period, verre églomisé was popular in the United States as decoration for such objects as clock cases and the panels of Sheraton style mirrors.
