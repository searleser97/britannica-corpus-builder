Soccus, plural socci,  soft light low-heeled sock shoe worn in ancient Greece and Rome. The actors in Roman comedies, specifically those of Plautus and Terence, were costumed in ordinary clothes and wore (if they did not go barefoot) the socci.
Indoors, Roman women often wore socci, made in a variety of colours and bejewelled or painted with designs. The modern sock is derived from the soccus.
