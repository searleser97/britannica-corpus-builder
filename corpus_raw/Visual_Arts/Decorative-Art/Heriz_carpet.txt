Heriz carpet, Heriz also spelled Herīs,  floor covering handmade in any of a group of villages near the town of Herīs, lying east of Tabrīz in northwest Iran. Heriz carpets—primarily room-sized, stout, serviceable, and attractive—have found ready markets in Europe and the United States. They are an offshoot, apparently, of the Tabrīz carpets, a country version of city styles. The smooth curves and flowing lines of a sophisticated Tabrīz medallion system are translated into hard, geometric angles and broken contours. Repeat patterns occur less frequently, and a jagged vine and rosette border is characteristic.
Different phases of this production and individual subvarieties have been sold in the West under specific village names, such as Sarāb (or Serapi), which has light, rather bright colour schemes; Gorevan, in darker colours; Bakshāyesh; and Mehrabān. Heriz carpets are symmetrically knotted on a cotton foundation. From time to time there has been experimentation in the production of silk rugs—again influenced by the Tabrīz rug trade—in rather crude designs and bold colours. Heriz carpets as here described do not predate the mid 19th century, at which time they apparently supplanted a rustic production for local use.
