Ghent-Bruges school,   group of manuscript illuminators and scribes active during the last quarter of the 15th and first part of the 16th centuries, principally in the Flemish cities of Ghent and Bruges. Credit for founding the tradition that included such masters as Nicolas Spierinc, Liévin van Lathem, Alexander and Simon Bening, and Gerard Horenbout was formerly given to the Master of Mary of Burgundy, but recent investigations have suggested that the designation “Master of Mary of Burgundy” is more of a scholarly convenience than a reasonable hypothesis and that the works attributed to this nonexistent master were executed by several different illuminators.
The Ghent-Bruges school produced deluxe manuscripts that were eagerly sought by ecclesiastical and secular princes in many parts of Europe. The masterpiece of the group is the Grimani Breviary (c. 1515; Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, Venice). Illuminated chiefly by Gerard Horenbout and Simon Bening, the calendar of the Breviary is an updating of the calendar from the Très riches heures du duc de Berry (Condé Museum, Chantilly, Fr.), which had been executed a century earlier.
During the last part of the school’s activity, Simon Bening was its major master, but by his death in 1561, manuscript illumination, like the handwritten book itself, had long been superseded by the invention of printing with movable type and mass-reproduction techniques.
