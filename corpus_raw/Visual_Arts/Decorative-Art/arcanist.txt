Arcanist,  (from Latin arcanum, “secret”), in the 18th century, a European who knew or claimed to know the secret of making certain kinds of pottery (especially true porcelain), which until 1707 was known only by the Chinese. The secret was discovered in Saxony by Ehrenfried Walter von Tschirnhaus and Johann Friedrich Böttger and was carefully guarded from potential rivals. A factory was established at Meissen about 1710, giving opportunities for gain to defecting workers, who could sell the secret to other pottery factories. There were many arcanists (and pseudoarcanists) itinerant in Europe in the 18th century, including Joseph Jakob Ringler, Robert Dubois, and Paul-Antoine Hannong and his sons Joseph-Adam and Pierre-Antoine.
