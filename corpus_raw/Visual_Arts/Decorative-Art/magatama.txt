Magatama, Korean kogok,  chiefly Japanese jade ornament shaped like a comma with a small perforation at the thick end; it was worn as a pendant, and its form may derive from prehistoric animal-tooth pendants. There are also examples with caps made of gold or silver. In Japan, magatamas have been made since the Neolithic Period, but they were particularly popular during the Tumulus (Japanese Kofun) period (3rdâ€“6th century). Along with the sword and the mirror, the magatama became one of the three items of Japanese imperial regalia.
In Korea, jade magatamas are also sporadically found at prehistoric sites, but they were in greatest vogue during the old Silla kingdom, the period corresponding to the Tumulus period in Japan. They were used as attachments to royal crowns and worn as earrings, necklaces, and the like.
