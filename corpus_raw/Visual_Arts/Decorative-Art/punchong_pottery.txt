Punch’ŏng pottery, Japanese mishima,  decorated celadon glazed ceramic, produced in Korea during the early Chosŏn period (15th and 16th centuries). Punch’ŏng ware evolved from the celadon of the Koryŏ period. Combined with the celadon glaze is the innovative Chosŏn surface decoration, which includes inlaying, stamping, incising, sgraffito, and the application of a white slip (liquid clay) beneath the final coating of transparent glaze.
At the beginning of the 15th century the inlay technique of Koryŏ celadon, in which the pattern was incised freehand, was taken over by Chosŏn potters, but they soon began to use stamps to produce in a matter of minutes an overall tiny floral pattern. Sometimes they also used sgraffito decoration in which patterns were incised through a grayish white slip. The potters of the 16th century abandoned designs altogether and simply coated the vessel with a white slip either entirely or partially with a wide brush leaving the traces of the swift brush movement, an effect that helped to create a sense of spontaneity.
