Cong, Wade-Giles romanization ts’ung,  Chinese jade form begun in the late Neolithic Period, it diminished after the Shang (18th–12th century bc) and Zhou (1111–256/255 bc) dynasties. A hollow cylinder or truncated cone enclosed in a rectangular body, the cong varies in proportion from squat to quite tall. The outer flat surfaces of the form are usually embellished with horizontal segments at the corners, while the planar surfaces are decorated with lines and other abstract designs. The cong was used as a ritual utensil during sacrificial and burial ceremonies. It was also sometimes made of stone.
