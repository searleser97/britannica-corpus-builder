Lenore Tawney, original name Leonora Agnes Gallagher,  (born May 10, 1907, Lorain, Ohio, U.S.—died Sept. 24, 2007, New York, N.Y.), American artist whose compositions helped transform weaving from an underappreciated craft into a new form of visual art.
Leonora Gallagher changed her first name to Lenore, which had fewer letters, when she was a first grader. Her 1941 marriage to George Tawney, a psychologist, ended after 18 months with his death. She attended the University of Illinois from 1943 to 1945 and then, while supporting herself as a proofreader for a legal publisher, took night courses in drawing, weaving, and sculpture at the Chicago Institute of Design (1946–48). After living in Paris from 1949 to 1951, during which time she traveled through Europe and into Morocco, Tawney briefly studied weaving in Penland, N.C.
In 1955 Tawney began her pioneering work in “woven forms.” Her travels through the Middle East, South America, and India led her to simplify her work and to use only black or undyed linen fibres and a few primary colours. She invented new devices that enabled her to create woven forms on a large scale, some of them reaching heights of 20 feet (6 metres). Her inclusion of inwoven slits allowed light to function as part of the overall composition. An example of her work is Cloud. It was created for the Federal Building in Santa Rosa, Calif., where its 16-foot (5-metre) blue linen strands seem to drop like threads of rain over the immense lobby. In 1965 Tawney began to make assemblages, and she also produced highly refined multimedia collages.
