Sceaux ware,   tin-glazed earthenware and porcelain made at a factory in Sceaux, Fr., from 1748 to 1794. Both were skillfully painted in a large range of enamel colours with landscape and figure subjects and with minutely exact flowers and birds. Cupids in pink outline derived from the paintings of Fran√ßois Boucher were typical of the period of Louis XV. Pieces decorated with naturalistic flowers, fruit, and the like in relief may have been modeled by Richard Glot, who purchased the factory in 1772.
