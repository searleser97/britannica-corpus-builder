Taotie, Wade-Giles romanization t’ao t’ieh,  monster mask commonly found on ancient Chinese ritual bronze vessels and implements.
The taotie characteristically consists of a zoomorphic mask in full face that may be divided, through the nose ridge at the centre, into profile views of two one-legged beasts (gui dragons) confronting each other. A ground pattern of squared spirals, the “thunder pattern” (lei-wen), often serves as a design filler between and around the larger features of the design.
Typical features of the mask include large, protuberant eyes; stylized depictions of eyebrows, horns, nose crest, ears, and two peripheral legs; and a line of a curled upper lip with exposed fangs and no lower jaw. The name taotie (“glutton”), which came into use by the 3rd century bc, was probably inspired by the fact that the monster is usually portrayed as an ever-devouring beast. The function of the taotie motif has been variously interpreted: it may be totemic, protective, or an abstracted, symbolic representation of the forces of nature. The motif was most common during the Shang (18th–12th century bc) and early Zhou (1111–c. 900 bc) dynasties. After the early Zhou period, the taotie mask motif was supplanted by a monster that was similar but depicted with diminished power and in a more literal manner.
