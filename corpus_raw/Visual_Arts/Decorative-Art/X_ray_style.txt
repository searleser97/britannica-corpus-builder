X-ray style,  manner of depicting animals by drawing or painting the skeletal frame and internal organs. It is one of the characteristic styles of the art of some prehistoric hunting cultures.
The style can be seen in the Mesolithic art of northern Europe (c. 8000–2700 bc), where early examples have been found, but animals with internal motifs have also been discovered in the art of hunting cultures in Siberia, the Arctic Circle, North America, western New Guinea, New Ireland, India, and Malaysia. It is found today primarily in the Aboriginal rock art and bark paintings of eastern Arnhem Land, in northern Australia.
Figures painted in X-ray style vary in size, reaching 8 feet (2.5 metres) in length. The style is also sometimes used to render delicate polychromed images of the interior cavity of the animal. Images are known in which only the outline and the skeleton of the bird, fish, or mammal are indicated, and the entire internal system of organs is expressed by a “life line,” a single horizontal line that runs from the animal’s mouth to a dot representing the heart or stomach. Whether the depiction of an animal in the X-ray style had particular religious symbolism is not known.
