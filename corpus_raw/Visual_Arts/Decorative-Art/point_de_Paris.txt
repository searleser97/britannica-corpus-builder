Point de Paris,   (French: “Paris lace”), product of a lace industry known to have existed around 1634 in the Île de France. No authenticated examples of this lace have been found, however. In modern usage, point de Paris has come to mean any bobbin-made lace with a six-pointed star mesh that is twisted, as opposed to that of Chantilly, which is plaited.
