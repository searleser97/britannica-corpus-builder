Farthingale chair,  armless chair with a wide seat covered in high-quality fabric and fitted with a cushion; the backrest is an upholstered panel, and the legs are straight and rectangular in section. It was introduced as a chair for ladies in the late 16th century and was named in England, probably in the 19th century, for its ability to accommodate the exceptionally wide-hooped skirts known as farthingales. An earlier English name was “imbrauderer’s chair,” or “upholsterer’s chair.” The farthingale chair was one of the earliest comfortable upholstered seats and was used in many parts of Europe and the United States.
