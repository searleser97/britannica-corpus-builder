Luristan Bronze, Luristan also spelled Lorestān,  any of the horse trappings, utensils, weapons, jewelry, belt buckles, and ritual and votive objects of bronze probably dating from roughly 1500–500 bce that have been excavated since the late 1920s in the Harsin, Khorramābād, and Alishtar valleys of the Zagros Mountains in the Lorestān region of western Iran. Their precise origin is unknown. Scholars believe that they were created either by the Cimmerians, a nomadic people from southern Russia who may have invaded Iran in the 8th century bce, or by such related Indo-European peoples as the early Medes and Persians.
