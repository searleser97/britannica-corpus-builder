Mackintosh,   waterproof outercoat or raincoat, named after a Scottish chemist, Charles Macintosh (1766â€“1843), who invented the waterproof material that bears his name. The fabric used for a mackintosh was made waterproof by cementing two thicknesses of it together with rubber dissolved in a coal-tar naphtha solution.
Macintosh patented his fabric in 1823. The word mackintosh has become a general term for any raincoat.
