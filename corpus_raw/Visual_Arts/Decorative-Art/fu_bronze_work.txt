Fu, Wade-Giles romanization fu,  type of Chinese bronze vessel used as a food container, it was produced largely from the middle Zhou period (c. 900–c. 600 bc) through the Warring States period (475–221 bc). Rectangular in shape and divided into two parts, the vessel was supported by angular feet at each corner; the lid was almost a duplicate of the bottom (in principle much like the dui). In ancient documents the vessel was also referred to as hu or hulian.
