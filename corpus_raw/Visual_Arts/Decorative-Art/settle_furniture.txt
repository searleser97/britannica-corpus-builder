Settle,  long wooden bench with backrest and arms, designed to seat several people. Originating in Europe in the 10th century, it was apparently derived from the chest, a resemblance often retained, with additional elements based on the monastic choir stall. It could be used for a variety of purposes: as a seat, a bed, a chest, and, in examples with a hinged backrest that can be turned down to rest on the arms, a table. Other additions to the basic shape were a footrest and sconces at the side or back to accommodate candles. The height of the backrest varied considerably and sometimes extended down to the floor. Both back and sides were usually paneled or ornamented (or both) with traditional carved patterns.
Although usually freestanding, settles were occasionally incorporated into the structure of a room, sometimes designed to fill a corner. By the 15th century they had become standard articles of furniture in inns and taverns, where they were usually provided with shelves protruding from the armrests, on which customers could rest their tankards. By the end of the 17th century, domestic versions had nailed-on leather upholstery, and for greater comfort the backrest was inclined. Surviving mainly in rural areas throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, settles became popular again with the historicizing movements in design during the early part of the 20th century, especially in the United States. A spindled variety resembling an extended Windsor chair was sometimes called a schoolmaster’s, or parson’s, bench.
