Sultanabad ware,   Islāmic ceramics produced at Sultanabad (modern Solṭānābād, Iran) that reached its peak as a style in the 13th and 14th centuries. Favourite types were minai (a method that preserved colours through firing), lustreware, faience in green and dark blue tones, often with molded ornamentation, and tiles richly decorated in lustre.
