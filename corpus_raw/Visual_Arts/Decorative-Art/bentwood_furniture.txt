Bentwood furniture,  type of furniture made by bending wooden rods into the required shape after they have been heated with steam. Although this method of bending wood was used by makers of the Windsor chair in the 18th century, it was not until the 1840s that its possibilities were exploited fully.
Michael Thonet, an Austrian cabinetmaker working in Vienna, experimented with designs based on birch rods bent into curvilinear shapes. His bentwood chairs are among the most successful examples of early mass-produced furniture. They were exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London and were sold in vast quantities throughout Europe and the United States for the rest of the century. Because bentwood furniture was light, comfortable, and inexpensive, as well as strong and graceful, it was widely used in clubs, hotels, shops, and restaurants. Many of the early bentwood pieces were stained black or dark brown. Seats were commonly made of cane or plywood and were the only portions not made by the bentwood method. One of the most aesthetically pleasing examples of bentwood furniture is the Thonet rocking chair.
The bentwood technique was revived by Le Corbusier and other leading designers and architects of the 20th century. The early tubular-steel furniture of the 1920s was also based on designs by Thonet and his sons.
