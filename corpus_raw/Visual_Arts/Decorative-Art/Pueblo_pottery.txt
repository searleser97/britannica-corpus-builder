Pueblo pottery,   one of the most highly developed of the American Indian arts, still produced today in a manner almost identical to the method developed during the Classic Pueblo period about ad 1050–1300. During the five previous centuries when the Pueblo Indians became sedentary, they stopped using baskets for carrying and began to manufacture and use clay pots, which had been cumbersome, breakable, and generally unsuited to their former nomadic lifestyle.
Pueblo pots, made only by the women of the tribe, are constructed not on a potter’s wheel but by hand. Long “sausages” of clay are coiled upward around a flat base of clay until the pot reaches the desired height; when the coiling is completed, the interior and exterior of the pot are smoothed, and the round coils are pressed together to form a smooth wall of the pot. The pots are then coated with slip, a watery clay substance, polished, decorated, and fired.
Designs include geometric patterns, usually angular, and floral, animal, and bird patterns. Colour schemes may be polychromatic, black on black, or black on cream.
