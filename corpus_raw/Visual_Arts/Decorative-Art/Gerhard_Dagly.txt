Gerhard Dagly,  (born c. 1653, Spa, Belg.—died  after 1714, ?, possibly Rhineland [Germany]), royal Kammerkünstler, or chamber artist, who, as one of the greatest craftsmen in European lacquer, was an important force behind the Baroque style.
After importers brought goods from the Orient, lacquer work won such enormous popularity that European artisans began imitating the medium. In the town of Spa, craftsmen specialized in creating small lacquered boxes called bois de Spa. Dagly worked there for a time, but little else is known of his early life.
At Berlin in 1687 he was appointed Kammerkünstler to Frederick William, the Great Elector of Brandenburg, who was succeeded in 1688 by Frederick III (later Frederick I, king of Prussia). During his reign Frederick gathered at his court many important artists and architects. Dagly was proclaimed directeur des ornements; in this capacity he decorated rooms and furniture. Copying Oriental prototypes, Dagly embellished Frederick’s palace with richly lacquered walls. His art helped make Berlin a centre of experimentation that later influenced European craftsmen. He enhanced his furniture with East Asian scenes, both in the traditional black and gold and in more individual colour schemes of greens, blues, and reds on milky backgrounds. His work helped make chinoiserie (European art done in an Oriental style) extremely popular in 18th-century France.
In 1713, on the succession of Frederick William I to the Prussian crown, Dagly’s world collapsed, for the new king severely stripped the court, considering art unnecessary and artists dispensable. Dagly then retired, being last heard from in the Rhineland (1714).
His brother Jacques, who worked with him from 1689 to about 1713, emigrated to Paris, carrying the secrets of Gerhard’s art that led to the innovations of the Martin brothers, who became royal decorators for Versailles.
