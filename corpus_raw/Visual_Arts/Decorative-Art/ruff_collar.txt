Ruff,   in dresswear, crimped or pleated collar or frill, usually wide and full, worn in Europe, especially from the mid-16th century into the 17th century, by both men and women. The beginnings of the ruff can be seen in the early years of the 16th century, when men allowed the top of the shirt to be exposed. A drawstring through the top, when pulled tight, created an incipient ruff. The ruff increased in size, becoming a symbol of the aristocracy. Women wanted to show their status in society and also wished to expose the bosom, so the ruff developed as a half circle—open in front and rising in back.
The ruff was at first worn with a supporting wire frame and was later starched. Usually, it was white. By the end of the 16th century, the ruff was generally replaced by other types of collars. Once again, in the early 19th century, a modified ruff became fashionable for women’s daytime wear.
