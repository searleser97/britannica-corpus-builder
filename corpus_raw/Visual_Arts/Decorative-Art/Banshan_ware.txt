Banshan ware, Wade-Giles romanization Pan-shan,  type of Chinese Neolithic painted pottery. Its name is derived from the grave site in the Gansu province of north China at which the pottery was found in 1924.
According to radiocarbon dating, Banshan ware is generally considered to be from between 2650 and 2350 bc. The extant specimens include urns, jars, basins, and bowls. Some of the wares were probably shaped on a slow, or hand-turned, wheel. The body of the ware was a reddish brown; there was no glaze. The decoration, mostly in black pigment probably applied with a brush, consisted of geometric patterns or stylized figures of men, fish, frogs, and birds. The handles were set low on the body of the urns, and the lower part of the body was left undecoratedâ€”as with most Greek Proto-Geometric funerary ware, to which there was a certain likeness.
The paucity of known Chinese Neolithic pottery at the time of the Banshan discovery gave the find an importance out of proportion to its size. Since the 1950s, however, the large amount of archaeological activity in China has placed Banshan ware in a larger framework of Neolithic Chinese pottery. Similar sites have been discovered in the Gansu and Qinghai provinces in northwest China.
