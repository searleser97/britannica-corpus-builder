Blonde lace,  any of several light-coloured laces. Originally the term referred to continuous-thread bobbin laces made in France from unbleached Chinese silk beginning in the mid-18th century. Later the term blonde was extended to include laces of bleached silk (white blonde) and black-dyed silk (black blonde). They were made at Bayeux, Caen, and Chantilly in the north, and imitations were produced in England during the lace’s most fashionable period. A light form of the lace with a design of scattered flowers was replaced by a heavier “Spanish” style, and large quantities were exported to Spain for mantillas, the quality being superior to the blonde lace produced in Catalonia. Large pieces were worked in straight-sided strips and then joined by hand.
