Treen,  small wooden objects in daily domestic or farm use and in use in trades and professions. Treen includes a wide variety of objects mostly associated with tableware, the kitchen, games, personal adornment, and toilet articles. The word is never applied to objects larger than a spinning wheel and does not include objects designed primarily for ornament. Etymologically, treen should be confined to wooden objects, but it is sometimes used in reference to utensils made of bone, horn, or ivory. Although the majority of the objects usually described as treen are of a rustic or primitive character, quite sophisticated forms were produced, especially in Italy, where close-grained hardwoods such as box were readily obtainable. The town of Tonbridge in Kent gave its name to a very elaborate type of treen with an intricate mosaic surface of different woods and grains composed in such a way as to make a pattern or, more frequently, picture. Tonbridge ware was especially popular in the 19th century for needle cases and similar accessories and was imitated extensively.
Until the mid-17th century, treen consisted of objects or parts of objects (e.g., a bowl and cover) sufficiently small to be made out of a single piece of wood by turning on a pole lathe. A necessary juncture was effected by turnery, in the form of a threaded pin and socket or two engaging threaded rims. From the 17th century onward, cabinetmakers became increasingly active in the manufacture of treen, partly because of a greater demand for small luxury products, partly because of the rediscovery of glue for constructional purposes.
