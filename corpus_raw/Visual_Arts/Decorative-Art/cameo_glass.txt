Cameo glass,  glassware decorated with figures and forms of coloured glass carved in relief against a glass background of a contrasting colour. Such ware is produced by blowing two layers of glass together. When the glass has cooled, a rough outline of the desired design is drawn on its surface and covered with a protective coating of beeswax. The glass is then etched down to the inner layer, leaving the design outline in relief. The details of the design are carved by hand or with rotary tools.
Fine cameo glass was produced by the Romans in the 1st century ce, as exemplified by the famous Portland Vase. Roman glass engravers created such pieces by manually cutting away chunks of opaque white glass to a darker background glass layer. In 1876 John Northwood, an English glassmaker, created a reproduction of the Portland Vase. This achievement inspired other glass engravers to make cameo glassware and initiated a revival of that glass form. Also about this time Émile Gallé began producing articles of cameo glass in France. His pieces featured graceful natural forms, including representations of flowers and animals.
