Rikka,   (Japanese: “standing flowers”), in classical Japanese floral art, a highly conventionalized and formal style of flower arranging. It is difficult to say when rikka became a distinct, recognized form, because it evolved over several centuries. The first rules for rikka arrangements may be traced back as far as the early 7th century, to the formulations of the Buddhist priest Ono no Imoko. However, rikka is often dated from the late 15th century, by which time it had clearly become a separate discipline through the influence of Senkei, a Buddhist priest and master of the Ikenobō school.
Rikka arrangements were originally seven-branched structures symbolizing the mythical Mount Meru of Buddhist cosmology; the branches represented its peak (ryō), waterfall (rō), hill (qaku), valley behind the mountain (bi), and the town (shi), and the whole structure was divided into in (“shade”) and yō (“sun”). Rikka later became a nine-branched, then eleven-branched, style with a basic three-element structure characteristic of all Japanese floral arrangements. The three main branches, shin (“truth”), soe (“supporting”), and nagashi (“flowing”), were placed so that their tips formed a scalene triangle.
The huge arrangements (5 to 15 feet [1.5 to 4.5 m] high) were constructed of evergreens, foliage, flowers, and bare branches representing the natural landscape; e.g., white holly blossoms symbolized snow-capped mountains, and cascades of white chrysanthemums stood for waterfalls.
The art of rikka was later modified into a less formal, more sweeping style popular in the homes of Japanese nobles. It was eventually supplanted by the shōka style, which retained a classical feeling but employed an asymmetrical structure.
