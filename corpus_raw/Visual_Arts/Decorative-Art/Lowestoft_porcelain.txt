Lowestoft porcelain,   English phosphatic soft-paste ware, resembling Bow porcelain, produced in Lowestoft, Suffolk, from 1757 to 1802; the wares are of a domestic kind, such as pots, teapots, and jugs. Generally on a small scale and light in weight, they are decorated in white and blue or in a polychrome that utilizes a bright brick red. After 1770 transfer printing was used. The shapes were copied from silverwork or from Bow and Worcester porcelain.
Lowestoft has no factory mark; but certain idiosyncrasies help to identify it, such as inside glazing of coffeepots and, on teapots, blue strokes painted at the junctures of handle and spout with the body. Some Lowestoft pieces bear dates, names of owners, or the words “A Trifle from Lowestoft,” and specimens with the mark of Meissen or Worcester are not uncommon. Porcelain made and decorated in China for export to Europe and America was confused with Lowestoft and is still erroneously called “Oriental Lowestoft” in the United States.
