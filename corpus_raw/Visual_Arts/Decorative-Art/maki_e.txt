Maki-e,   (Japanese: “sprinkled picture”), lacquer ware on which the design is made by sprinkling or spraying wet lacquer with metallic powder, usually gold or silver, from a dusting tube, sprinkler canister (makizutsu), or hair-tipped paint brush (kebo). The technique was developed mainly during the Heian period (794–1185) to decorate screens, albums, inrō, letter boxes, and ink-slab cases. The oldest preserved piece is from 919.
Maki-e can be left to dry, as is maki-hanashi, or relacquered and polished (togidashi maki-e). It is frequently decorated with reed-style pictures (ashide-e) or combined with inlays of other metals or mother-of-pearl (raden). Hiramaki-e has a low-relief design, and takamaki-e has a high-relief design.
