Caoshu, (Chinese: “draft script,” or “grass script”)  Wade-Giles romanization ts’ao-shu,  in Chinese calligraphy, a cursive variant of the standard Chinese scripts lishu and kaishu and their semicursive derivative xingshu. The script developed during the Han dynasty (206 bc–ad 220), and it had its period of greatest growth during the Tang dynasty (618–907). In caoshu the number of strokes in characters are reduced to single scrawls or abstract abbreviations of curves and dots. Strokes of varying thickness and modulation show a great variety of shapes. Caoshu is not bound by rules for even spacing, and characters need not be of the same approximate size; the calligrapher thus has the fullest freedom of expressive movement of line. Caoshu can be subcategorized into three major forms that chronologically transmuted and developed as follows: (1) zhangcao (draft cursive), (2) jincao (modern cursive), and (3) kuangcao (wild, or “crazy” cursive).
