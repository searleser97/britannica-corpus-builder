Leadwork,   sculpture, ornamental objects, and architectural coverings and fittings made of lead. Although the ease with which lead is smelted from lead ores ensured its early discovery, the softness of the metal restricted its use until Roman times. The earliest known use of lead dates from about 3000 bc in Egypt and Asia Minor, when it was used in making small statuettes and votive figures. Lead was used infrequently, however, until about 500 bc, when the Greeks began using it for small sculptures, toys, and market weights. The Romans used lead extensively for ornamental purposes in decorative boxes, wine cups, and other household items. Roman engineers developed architectural uses—for roof coverings, masonry, gutters, water pipes, and cisterns—that were continued for centuries.
During the European Middle Ages, lead was put to wide use as a covering for roofs, domes, and cathedral spires. It was also used in fashioning stained-glass windows, coffins, coins, tokens, and inscribed plaques for buildings. Lead was sometimes decorated by tinning, painting, lacquering, or gilding. Lead trappings were often added to statues carved from stone. Lead casts well, preserving fine detail from the mold. Although often rejected in favour of other materials (particularly bronze), lead has found continual use in sculpture. Its ability to withstand corrosion has proven a major asset, although large lead sculptures need internal reinforcement to prevent the weight of the work from causing it to collapse.
