Jungfrauenbecher,   (German: “maiden’s cup”), silver cup shaped like a girl with a wide-spreading skirt (forming a large cup when inverted) holding a pivoted bowl above her head. The form apparently originated in late 16th-century Germany, but only a few examples survive from the 17th century. Jungfrauenbecher were used at nuptial feasts when the bridegroom drank a toast out of the skirt cup and then was supposed to right the figure without spilling the wine in the pivoted bowl, which was to be drunk by the bride. It was also a wager cup—the challenged having to drink from both cups without spilling the contents of either.
A number of Jungfrauenbecher were produced in London in 1827 copying the one in the Vintners Hall, and the form was revived in Germany and Holland in the second half of the 19th century.
