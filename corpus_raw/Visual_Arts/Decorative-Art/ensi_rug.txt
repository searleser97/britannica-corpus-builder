Ensi rug,  floor covering, usually about 1.4 × 1.5 metres (4.5 feet × 5 feet), of a type apparently woven by all Turkmen tribes, with enough similarity in format to suggest that they are all descended from the same basic design. The field is usually quartered, with a thick band up the middle, at times culminating in an arch, as on the Tekke ensi. Some ensis, such as those made by the Saryk, show a row of arches across the top, while others have none. The field quadrants themselves are covered with small repeating geometric figures, and there are extra cross panels at the lower end of the field. The type was formerly referred to as a katchli or hatchlu in the trade.
There is some controversy regarding the use of ensis, as the arches on some examples suggest that they were used as prayer rugs. Whether or not this is true, they were also often used as door covers for the felt tents of the Turkmen.
