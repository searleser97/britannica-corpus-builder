Psykter,   ancient Greek pottery vessel with a tall, cylindrical foot, rounded body, and short neck, used for cooling wine. Filled with wine, it could be placed inside a larger vessel, such as a krater, which had been filled with snow; or the psykter itself might be filled with snow and placed inside a larger vessel containing the wine.
