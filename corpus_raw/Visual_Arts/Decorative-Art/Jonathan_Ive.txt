Jony Ive, in full Sir Jonathan Paul Ive,  (born February 1967, London, England), British industrial designer who, while holding various posts at Apple Inc. (1992–2019), made design as integral to the appeal of a personal computer as its power and speed.
Ive studied art and design at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria University). After graduating in 1989, he cofounded Tangerine, a London-based design consultancy that counted Apple among its clients. In 1992 Apple offered Ive a full-time position at its headquarters in Cupertino, California. He accepted, but it was not until Apple cofounder Steve Jobs returned to the troubled company as CEO in 1997 that the real impact of Ive’s design ethos began to be felt.
Working on the belief that the computer had become the centre of home life, Ive, from 1997 Apple’s vice president of industrial design, fashioned machines that were sleek, touchable, and amenable to display. Ease and simplicity of use—his watchwords—were achieved by devoting “obsessive attention to details that are often overlooked.” Ive’s design for the 1998 iMac, for example, stunned consumers and critics alike with its translucent candy colours and a seductively rounded exterior over a functional core that was itself a product of high design. The design also called for reshaping the processor to fit within the machine’s colourful shell and thus dramatically shrank the computer’s footprint. After two million iMacs were sold in 1998, the design gave Apple its first profitable year since 1995.
Subsequent designs reflected Ive’s continuing effort to maximize efficiency and convenience for the user. The 2000 Power Mac G4 Cube could be easily removed from its one-piece plastic housing for internal access, and air circulated freely through its suspended core, obviating the need for noisy fans. Processor, drives, wireless technology, and even the power supply were incorporated into the 26.9-cm- (10.6-inch-) wide base of the 2002 flat-panel iMac computer, which became Apple’s top-selling product for that year. The 2003 PowerBook G4, launched as the world’s lightest and slimmest laptop computer, included a 43-cm (17-inch) LCD screen, a backlit keyboard, the latest wireless technology, and a bevy of other features that brought Ive’s vision of the comforts of home to computing on the road. In 2003 Ive was named the Designer of the Year by the Design Museum. The prize, worth £25,000 (about $41,000) and awarded annually by the London museum to a designer born or based in the United Kingdom, recognized Ive’s pioneering designs for the 2002 flat-panel iMac.
Ive became Apple’s senior vice president of industrial design in 2005. At Apple he continued to develop the design of such popular products as the iPod portable MP3 player (first introduced in 2001) and the iPhone (2007). By 2008 Ive had won six Black Pencils, the prestigious D&AD (Design & Art Direction) awards. In 2012 Ive and his team were named the best design studio of the past 50 years by D&AD. Three years later he handed over much of his day-to-day management responsibilities when he became chief design officer. However, in 2017 he reassumed direct control of product design. Two years later Ive left Apple to open (with Marc Newson) the design firm LoveFrom, though the computer company was among its clients.
Ive was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2006 and Knight Commander (KBE) in 2012.
