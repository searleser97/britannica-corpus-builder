Jian, Wade-Giles romanization chien,  type of ancient Chinese bronze vessel having a large, deep bowl with a heavy rim that is meant to contain water or ice.
The jian, which has a simple silhouette, is supported upon a narrow ring base. It has two or four ring handles that freely hang from slightly modeled monster masks (taotie). The decoration of the jian characteristic of the late Zhou dynasty (c. 600–256/255 bc), from which the vessel is exclusively found, consists of either densely patterned decorative designs or representations of hunts and similar activities. Larger jian were probably used as bathtubs. When full of water, the jian’s water surface plane was also used as a mirror; the word jian later came to mean “mirror” in Chinese.
