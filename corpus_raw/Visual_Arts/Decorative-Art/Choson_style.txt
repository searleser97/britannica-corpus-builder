Chosŏn style, also called Yi style, Chosŏn also spelled Joseon,  Korean visual arts style characteristic of the Chosŏn dynasty (1392–1910). Chosŏn craftsmen and artisans, unable except occasionally to draw inspiration from imported Chinese art, relied on their own sense of beauty and perfection. Particularly in the decorative arts, the Chosŏn style showed a more spontaneous, indigenous aesthetic sense than the sophisticated aristocratic elegance of the Koryŏ (Goryeo) style of the preceding centuries.
After 1592 many palaces and temples were built, most in the tap’o (dapo) style. Buddhist images were usually made of wood instead of bronze, iron, or granite and were usually undistinguished. Among the secular arts, painting and pottery were the most important. While most pottery of this period is distinctly rougher than that of China in the Ming and Qing periods, the decoration is magnificent in quality. Among the wares produced were a celadon called punch’ŏng (buncheong) and a porcelain ware with excellent designs painted in an underglaze blue.
