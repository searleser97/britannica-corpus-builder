Confidante,   type of sofa that has a seat at each end separated from the main seat by an upholstered arm. This form was first used in France in the mid-18th century and was subsequently introduced into England. George Hepplewhite illustrated one in Cabinet-Maker and Upholstererâ€™s Guide (1788).
The name was revived in the second half of the 19th century for various types of seats accommodating two or more couples side by side, each couple facing a different direction. A common form was an S-shape for two couples, the couples seated side by side but facing in the opposite direction.
