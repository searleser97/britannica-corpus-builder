Hedwig glass,   Egyptian-made glass of the 11th or 12th century, of which only 12 known examples exist; they are among the last cut glass produced in the East. Their designs of stylized lions and griffins among palm leaves are cut in high relief, a technique derived from rock-crystal cutting. Carried to Europe by returning crusaders, these glasses often became the property of Western churches. Their name derives from St. Hedwig (died 1243), patron saint of Silesia, who allegedly performed a wine miracle in one of these glasses. Another glass—once belonging to St. Elizabeth and later given to Martin Luther—was said to give strength to women in labour when they drank from it.
