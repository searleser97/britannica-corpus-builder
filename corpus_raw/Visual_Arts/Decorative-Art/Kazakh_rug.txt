Kazakh rug,  floor covering woven by villagers living in western Azerbaijan and in a number of towns and villages in northern Armenia and the adjacent southern part of Georgia. The weavers are probably mostly Azerbaijanian Turks, although it is clear that both Armenians and Georgians have taken part in the production of these rugs.
Kazakh rugs are all wool, coarsely knotted in the symmetrical knot with a long, lustrous pile, and use strong red, blue, and ivory in bold combinations with relatively simple but dramatic designs. The rugs seldom exceed about 1.7 × 2 metres (5.5 × 7 feet), and many of the smaller pieces are in prayer rug designs. Many show three medallions of approximately equal size, while another common format involves a central square enclosing geometric figures with two smaller squares at each end.
