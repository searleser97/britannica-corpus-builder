Cafaggiolo majolica, also spelled Cafaggiolo Maiolica,  Italian tin-glazed earthenware produced during the early 16th century under Medici patronage in the castle of Cafaggiolo, in Tuscany. The decoration of Cafaggiolo ware is mostly derived from other leading Italian factories, particularly Faenza; but its execution reveals individual, unique artistry. Characteristics of the ware are a rich and even white glaze, a deep red, and an intense lapis lazuli, which was often used as a coarsely brushed background; bright yellows, oranges, and reds and a semitransparent copper green were also used. Forms include armorial jugs and double-handled jars—both especially vigorous in overall decoration—and drug pots. Many Cafaggiolo dishes were painted in the istoriato style, showing a biblical, historical, or mythological scene. Usually the rim of an istoriato dish is reserved for rich grotesques or other intricate motifs; but some plates are wholly covered by a design, such as an outstanding piece in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, representing a maiolica painter at work. From a limited output, a handful of Cafaggiolo dishes rank among the best of Italian majolica. The factory declined after 1540.
