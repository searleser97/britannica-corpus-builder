Pergola,   garden walk or terrace, roofed with an open framework over which plants are trained. Its purpose is to provide a foundation on which climbing plants can be seen to advantage and to give shade. It was known in ancient Egypt and was a common feature of early Renaissance gardens in Italy and subsequently throughout Europe.
Pergolas have always been popular in hot climates, and in Mediterranean countries they are frequently covered with vines or ivy. In more northerly countries, where shade is less attractive, they are less common; but they had a marked revival during the Arts and Crafts movement in Great Britain in the early 20th century for the purpose of growing wisteria and were prominent features at the William Randolph Hearst castle at San Simeon, Calif.
