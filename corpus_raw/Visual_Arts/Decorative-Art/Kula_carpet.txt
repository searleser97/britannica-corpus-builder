Kula carpet, Kula also spelled Koula or Kulah,  floor covering handwoven in Kula, a town east of İzmir, in western Turkey. Kula prayer rugs were produced throughout the 19th century and into the 20th and have been favourites among collectors. Usually the arch (to indicate the direction of Mecca, the holy city) is low and straight-sided; the columnar sides of the prayer niche may appear as broad, ribbonlike pendant forms. Central motifs are sometimes highly elaborate. In one late 19th-century type, there are rows of scenes, with trees and small buildings; this rug, at times called a “cemetery carpet,” is said to be used at funerals.
Early Kula prayer rugs have strong reds and good blues; but the dyeing practices rapidly became slack, so that in most later examples the red has been exchanged for an assortment of muddy brown and yellow shades, often combined with a good surviving blue. Early carpets are not as finely woven as Ghiordes carpets, and late ones are quite loosely made. Additional types were produced, such as the Kumurju Kulas, usually dark-field carpets that often reproduce the designs of Transylvanian rugs, with prominent vases and yellow borders. Like other great carpet-weaving centres in Turkey, Kula produced many crudely woven carpets for the European market in the late 19th century.
