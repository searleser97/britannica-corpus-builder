Frisian carving,  in decorative arts, lightly carved ornamentation on furniture made by the Pennsylvania Germans, whose emigration from Hanoverian Friesland to colonial British America began in the 17th century. As immigrants, they attempted to retain both their identity and their traditions by transmitting folk emblems to their new surroundings in this way. Popular motifs were crowned kings, stags and other animals of the chase, stylized lilies, and pairs of unicorns confronting each other.
