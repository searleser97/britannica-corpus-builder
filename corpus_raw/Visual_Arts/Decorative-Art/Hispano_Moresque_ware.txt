Hispano-Moresque ware,  tin-glazed, lustred earthenware made by Moorish potters in Spain, chiefly at MÃ¡laga in the 15th century, and in the region of Manises, near Valencia, in the 16th century. The tin glaze was applied over a design usually traced in cobalt blue; after the first firing, the lustre, a metallic pigment, was applied by brush over the tin glaze, and the piece was fired again. The effect varies from a pale yellow iridescence in early pieces to a coarser, copperish iridescence in late work. Early designs are Islamic: the tree of life, palm motifs, and Arabic inscriptions, for example. Later designs combine Islamic and Italian Renaissance motifs. Misspelled or intentionally illegible Arabic inscriptions indicate that the work was taken over by Spanish Christian craftsmen. Imitation of this pottery in Italy led to the development of Italian maiolica ware.
