Häufebecher,   (German: “stacking cup”), beaker, usually of silver, that is part of a set that can be stacked or piled up. Pieces are made so that the base of one fits into the bowl of another. Each beaker has a deep, straight-sided bowl—often engraved with a hunting scene—a small foot, and a narrow raised band around the centre of the body. When beakers of this type were made in sets of a dozen, they were known as Monatsbecher (“month beaker”)—one beaker for each month of the year. They were used almost exclusively in German-speaking countries—many being produced in Nürnberg—and were fashionable between the early 16th century and the middle of the 17th century.
