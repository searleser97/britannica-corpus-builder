Jadeite,   gem-quality silicate mineral in the pyroxene family that is one of the two forms of jade (q.v.). The more prized of the two types of jade, jadeite (imperial jade) is usually found as transparent-to-opaque, compact, cryptocrystalline lenses, veins, or nodules. It may be distinguished from nephrite (mutton-fat jade), jade’s other form, by its granular fracture and glassy lustre; in addition, polished surfaces often show pitting caused by varying hardness. Jadeite, sodium aluminum silicate (NaAlSi2O6), may contain a number of impurities (often calcium) that give it a variety of colours: white, emerald green, apple green, red, brown, and blue. Deep green to greenish black varieties are called chloromelanite and are coloured by iron.
Jadeite occurs only in metamorphic rocks, most often in those that have been subjected to the high pressures deep below the Earth’s surface. Jadeite is rare; its presence at the surface indicates great uplift of earlier buried regions and great amounts of erosion. The most important source is the large deposit near Tawmaw, Myanmar (Burma). Jadeite has also been found near Omi and Kotaki, Japan; in the Motagua River valley of Guatemala; in San Benito county, Calif.; Kazakhstan; and the Ural Mountains, Russia.
