Alpujarra rug,  handwoven floor covering with pile in loops, made in Spain from the 15th to the 19th century in the Alpujarras district south of Granada. The construction of these rugs makes them more suitable for spreads than for floor use.
The foundation is of linen, and the woolen pile material runs along with the weft, each colour pulled up above the surface in loops as needed in the design. This technique may have been long practiced in the area, but surviving examples probably do not predate the 18th century. The patterns, which can best be described as folk art, are varied, and the colouring is strong.
