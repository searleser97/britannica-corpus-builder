Öttingen–Schrattenhofen faience,  German tin-glazed earthenware made in Bavaria in the 18th and 19th centuries. The factory was first established at Öttingen in 1735 and two years later was moved to Schrattenhofen. The ware is characteristic of much produced in Bavaria—e.g., cylindrical beer tankards—and the decoration is likewise Bavarian in the Rococo style. The factory also produced less ornate ware and, in later years, like many German faience centres, a cream-coloured earthenware inspired by that of Wedgwood.
