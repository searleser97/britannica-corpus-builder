Tucker porcelain,   pottery ware made from 1826 to 1838 at a factory founded in Philadelphia by William Ellis Tucker, who had found porcelain ingredients at sites near Wilmington, Del., and in New Jersey. At first, transfer-printed landscapes and floral patterns were executed on porcelain; from about 1831 ornate pieces, such as vases decorated with overglaze painting in the style of SÃ¨vres porcelain, were produced; cups decorated with the heads of U.S. presidents date from about 1836.
