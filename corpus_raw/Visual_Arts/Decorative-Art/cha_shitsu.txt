Cha-shitsu,  small Japanese garden pavilion or room within a house, specifically designed for the tea ceremony. Ideally, the cha-shitsu, or tea house, is separated from the house and is approached through a small garden called a roji (“dewy path”), the first step in breaking communication with the outer world. The tea house is usually a small, thatched-roof structure with plain plaster walls, whose several openings, placed at different heights and filled with shoji (sliding panels of wooden lattice covered with translucent paper), admit a soft, diffused light. A small, “kneeling-in” entrance, about 75 cm (2.5 feet) square, set above a stepping stone, is intended to inculcate humility in all who enter. The interior is large enough to accommodate five kneeling guests, which is the ideal number. The cha-shitsu is completely bare except for the tokonoma, the alcove in which paintings, pottery, flower arrangements, and other forms of art are displayed.
The most famous of all tea masters, Sen Rikyū (1522–91), was the first to build a cha-shitsu that was a separate structure instead of a special room within the house.
