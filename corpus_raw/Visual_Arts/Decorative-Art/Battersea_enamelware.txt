Battersea enamelware,   type of painted enamelware considered the finest of its kind to be produced in England during the mid-18th century. It is especially noted for the high quality of its transfer printing. Battersea ware was made at York House in Battersea, a district in London, by Stephen Theodore Janssen between 1753 and 1756. This ware is variably composed of soft white enamel completely covering a copper ground. A design is applied to the white enamel either by painting by hand or by transfer printing, a process by which an impression from an engraved metal plate brushed with enamel colours is transferred to paper and then to the surface to be decorated. Transfer printing was used on a large scale for the first time at Battersea. Most of the articles produced there, small ornamental pieces such as snuffboxes and watchcases, were decorated in the Rococo style with mottoes, portraits, landscapes, or flowers. The shapes of the objects and the decorative motifs are often imitative of Meissen porcelain ware.
