Seraband rug, Seraband also spelled Saraband,  handwoven floor covering made in the Ser-e Band locality, southwest of Arāk in west-central Iran. These 19th- and early 20th-century rugs, noted for their sturdiness and unobtrusive charm, have a characteristic pattern (known commercially as the mīr design) of small, complex leaf (boteh) or leaf forms in diagonal rows, their tips pointed alternately in opposite directions. A geometric vine with similar leaf forms usually occupies the principal border stripe. There may be geometric cornerpieces or perhaps a small, similarly geometric central medallion.
Dark blue and ivory are used as ground colours, as well as the usual Seraband red. The knotting is symmetrical, on a cotton foundation. Large Seraband rugs are narrow rather than of room dimension.
