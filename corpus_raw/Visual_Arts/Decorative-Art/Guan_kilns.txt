Guan kilns, Pinyin Guan yao, or Wade-Giles Kuan yao,  Chinese kilns known for creating an imperial variety of stoneware during the Song dynasty (ad 960â€“1279). After the Song royal court moved to the south, Guan kilns produced ware from about 1127 at Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. One of the official kilns, Jiaotan, has been located by scholars near Wugui Shan (Tortoise Hill); many rich examples of the ware were unearthed there. Guan ware was characterized by a wash of brown slip and by glazes varying from pale green to lavender blue. Artisans often applied brown pigment to emphasize a wide-meshed network of cracks.
