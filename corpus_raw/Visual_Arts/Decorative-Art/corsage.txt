Corsage,   a small bouquet of flowers originally worn by women at the waist or bodice and later worn on the shoulder or wrist or pinned to a handbag. A florist constructs a corsage from the heads of flowers; he inserts wires through the calyx (the external leaves at the base of a flower), binds them with tape or ribbon, bends them into shape, adds leaves or foliage, and then adds a ribbon or other embellishment. Introduced during the 18th century, the wearing of a corsage, which was usually supplied by an escort, became a popular custom during the 20th century.
