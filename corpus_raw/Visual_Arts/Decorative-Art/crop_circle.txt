Crop circle,  large geometric pattern of flattened crops, most often found in fields in southern England. Crop circles are said by some who have studied them to be messages from intelligent extraterrestrial life, but many have been proved to be the work of humans.
Beginning in the late 1970s, simple crop circles began to appear regularly in the fields of Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Somerset, and Gloucestershire in southern England. They were made at night, and over the years they became more complex, growing into large patterns of geometric forms hundreds of feet across. Some people who studied crop circles were convinced that their intricacy and the fact that the plants seemed to be bent but not broken precluded a human creator, which meant that they were being produced either by some unknown natural phenomenon or by extraterrestrials.
In 1991 Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, of Southampton, England, confessed to having made more than 200 crop circles since the late 1970s with nothing more complex than ropes and boards. They had initially been inspired by a 1966 account of a UFO sighting near Tully, Queensland, Australia, in which a flying saucer supposedly landed in a lagoon and left behind a depressed area of reeds. As crop circles became more prominent in the media, Bower and Chorleyâ€™s patterns became more complex, and they delighted in confounding the expectations of those who studied the circles.
Crop circles appear regularly throughout the world, but the majority still appear in England. Others followed Bower and Chorley, and even those who view crop circles as messages from extraterrestrials or as unexplained natural phenomena admit that a significant portion are made by humans.
