Pleached alley,   garden path, on each side of which living branches have been intertwined in such a way that a wall of self-supporting living foliage has grown up. To treat each side of a garden walk, or alley, with pleaching and thus make a secluded walk was a favourite device of the 16th and 17th centuries. Although most pleaching is done by gardeners, it can also occur naturally. Maples, sycamores, and lindens are commonly pleached.
