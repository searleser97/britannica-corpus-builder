Bracteate,   thin, gold, disk-shaped pendant peculiar to early Scandinavian civilizations. Bracteates were produced by first carving the design in relief on some resistant material, such as bronze or wood, and then pressing a thin sheet of gold over the carving.
These circular bracteates were derived from late Roman and Byzantine coins. Goldsmiths later abandoned the Roman originals for a local style of animal ornament or for designs representing their native deities, such as Thor riding a goat.
