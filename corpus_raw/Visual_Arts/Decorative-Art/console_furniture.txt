Console,  in furniture, a type of side table placed against a wall and normally fixed to it, requiring legs or other decorative support only at the front. Because it was viewed only from the front or sides, the back was left undecorated; the top was often of marble. In 17th-century Italy the console table was a major manifestation of the fashion of furniture made for display. Many examples of this period were carved and were, in fact, pieces of sculpture as much as furniture. An opulent group of consoles was made in 1675â€“78 for the Palazzo Colonna in Rome; supports for the tops were commonly carved as human figures, eagles, tumbling putti (cupids), flamboyant foliage, and dolphins, and they often were gilded.
The French continued the fashion for grand consoles during the reign of Louis XIV, reducing the front support to a pair of inward-curving legs joined by a stretcher. Many of these consoles were made in pairs and were designed to be topped by matching mirrors. They were one of the most successful expressions of the Rococo style, which, after developing in France, became popular in England and other parts of Europe. During the classical revival in the last quarter of the 18th century, mahogany and satinwood consoles with decoration painted in pale colours were introduced in England.
