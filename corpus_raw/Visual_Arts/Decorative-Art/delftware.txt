Delftware, also called delft,  tin-glazed earthenware first made early in the 17th century at Delft, Holland. Dutch potters later brought the art of tin glazing to England along with the name delft, which now applies to wares manufactured in the Netherlands and England, as distinguished from faience, made in France, Germany, Spain, and Scandinavia, and majolica, made in Italy. See tin-glazed earthenware; Dutch ware.
