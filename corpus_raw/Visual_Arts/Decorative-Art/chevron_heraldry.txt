Chevron,  decorative motif consisting of two slanting lines forming an inverted V. From very early times, it has been a common motif in pottery and textiles. A bent bar in heraldry, it is also one of the most common distinguishing marks for military and naval uniforms: placed on the sleeves, it serves as a mark of rank or longevity of service.
In architecture the name chevron is sometimes applied to the angle formed by the juncture of the rafters of a roof, but it is more often used for purely decorative motifs. A zigzag pattern formed of joined chevrons, used to decorate arch moldings and column shafts, was one of the most common Romanesque geometric ornaments, especially notable in areas under Norman influence.
