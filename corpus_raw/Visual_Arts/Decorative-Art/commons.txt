Commons,   in Anglo-American property law, an area of land for use by the public. The term originated in feudal England, where the “waste,” or uncultivated land, of a lord’s manor could be used for pasture and firewood by his tenants. For centuries this right of commons conflicted with the lord’s right to “approve” (i.e., appropriate for his own use) any of his waste, provided he left enough land to support the commoners’ livestock. In the 19th century the right of approvement was in effect assumed by the government. Under modern agriculture, common pasturing became obsolete, and commons became public land used mostly for recreation.
In the American Colonies, where there was no manorial system, commons took the form of a town square or green devoted to municipal or recreational use.
