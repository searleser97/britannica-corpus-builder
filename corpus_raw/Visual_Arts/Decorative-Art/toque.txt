Toque,   small, round, close-fitting hat, brimless or with a small brim, once worn by both men and women. In the 12th and 13th centuries, women wore embroidered toques, made of velvet, satin, or taffeta, on top of their head-veils.
In the late 16th century, brimless, black velvet toques were popular with men and women. Throughout the 19th century, women wore toques, often small, trimmed with fur, lace, bows, flowers, or leaves. The typical white bakerâ€™s cap, traditionally worn by chefs, is a form of toque.
