Onyx,   striped, semiprecious variety of the silica mineral agate with white and black alternating bands. Onyx is used in carved cameos and intaglios because its layers can be cut to show a colour contrast between the design and the background. Other varieties include carnelian onyx, with white and red bands, and sardonyx, with white and brown bands. The chief localities of onyx are India and South America. The name was used by the Romans for a variety of stones including alabaster, chalcedony, and what is now known as onyx marble. Onyx is one of the 12 stones mentioned in the Bible (Exodus 28:20; 39:13) as adorning the breastplate (ḥoshen) of Yahweh’s high priests. Its properties are the same as those of quartz.
