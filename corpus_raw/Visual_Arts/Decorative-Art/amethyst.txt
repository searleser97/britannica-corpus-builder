Amethyst,  a transparent, coarse-grained variety of the silica mineral quartz that is valued as a semiprecious gem for its violet colour. Its physical properties are those of quartz, but it contains more iron oxide (Fe2O3) than any other variety of quartz, and experts believe that its colour arises from its iron content. Other theories attribute the colour to contained manganese or hydrocarbons. Heating removes the colour from amethyst or changes it to the yellow of citrine; most commercial citrine is made in this manner. Notable occurrences of amethyst include those in Brazil, Uruguay, Ontario, and North Carolina.
The name, derived from the Greek amethystos, “not intoxicated,” expresses the ancient folk belief that the stone protects its owner against drunkenness. In ancient writings the Latin name amethystus was used for amethyst, purple corundum, and purple garnet. Amethyst is the birthstone for February and is usually facetted with step cuts or emerald cuts, but it has been used for carved intaglios since ancient times. Amethyst is mentioned in the Bible (Exodus 28:19; 39:12) as one of the 12 stones adorning the breastplate (ḥoshen) of the high priests of Yahweh.
