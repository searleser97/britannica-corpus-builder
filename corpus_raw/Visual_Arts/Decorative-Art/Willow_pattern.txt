Willow pattern,   landscape design developed by Thomas Turner at Caughley, Shropshire, Eng., in 1779 in imitation of the Chinese. Its classic components are a weeping willow, pagoda-like structures, three men on a quaint bridge, and a pair of swallows, and the usual colour scheme is blue on white, though there are variants. Very similar landscape patterns in the Chinese taste had been used earlier. In the late 18th century, Willow patterns were produced at Lowestoft, Suffolk, New Hall, Staffordshire, and elsewhere. A legend of lovers transformed into swallows associated with the Willow pattern is English, not Chinese. “Nanking” porcelain, often confused with Blue Willow ware, was export ware decorated in blue on white, made at Ching-te-chen and shipped from the port of Nanking; polychromed export porcelain was shipped through Canton.
