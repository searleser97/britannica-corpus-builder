William Vile,  (born c. 1700â€”died  September 1767), English cabinetmaker of the 18th century.
Vile was long overshadowed by his business neighbour Thomas Chippendale. Vile set up a partnership in London with John Cobb about 1750 and became royal cabinetmaker the following year. The partners were not known as great innovators, but their standard of craftsmanship was seldom equaled. One outstanding piece was a jewel cabinet of mahogany, inlaid with ivory and various woods and exquisitely carved, made for Queen Charlotte in 1761.
