Application lace, French point appliqu√©,  lace produced by the application, by stitching, of design motifs (typically floral) to a background net made either by hand or by machine. This technique was common in the second half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th century.
The only handmade net commonly used was made in Brussels, later imitated in Honiton, Devonshire, Eng., and known as drochel. The fine meshes were hexagonal, the threads of the two longer sides being plaited four times and of the shorter sides twisted. In Brussels application the motifs could be made either by bobbin (an elongated spool of thread) or by needle; in Honiton they were always bobbin-made. At first a knitted machine net was used, but from 1810 this was replaced by a cotton bobbinet made on a twist-net machine. In Carrickmacross application, a related form made in County Monaghan, Ire., a muslin fabric was stitched to a machine net.
