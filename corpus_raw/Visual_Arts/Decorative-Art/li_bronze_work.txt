Li, Wade-Giles romanization li,  Chinese bronze, wide-mouthed cooking vessel that was supported by three legs shaped like pointed lobes. These legs were well articulated on the body of the vessel and formed an extension of the interior volume.
A coarse pottery, li was made in the Neolithic Period (c. 3000–2000 bc); this shape appeared in the bronze art of the Shang dynasty (18th–12th century bc) and was continued into the Zhou (c. 1111–255 bc) and beyond. It also reappeared in the pottery of early historical periods, but with shorter legs. The pottery form of the li was gradually replaced by the fu during the Warring States period (475–221 bc). The vocabulary of animal motifs that so typically decorates ritual bronze vessels was generally more limited on the li.
