Raqqah ware,  type of Islamic lustreware produced at Al-Raqqah, Syria, between the 9th and 14th centuries. The body of the ware, which is white tending to buff, is coated with a siliceous glaze. Designs, sometimes in relief, tend to be bold. Decoration includes brown lustre and blue and black underglaze paint. Glazes, either opaque or transparent, are usually in shades of blue, bluish green, or turquoise; however, clear glazes, as well as glazes stained purple with manganese, were also used.
