Jeans, also called Blue Jeans, Dungarees, Denims, or Levi’s,  trousers originally designed in the United States by Levi Strauss in the mid-19th century as durable work clothes, with the seams and other points of stress reinforced with small copper rivets. They were eventually adopted by workingmen throughout the United States and then worldwide.
Jeans are particularly identified as a standard item of “Western” apparel worn by the American cowboy. After the mid-20th century, various adaptations became internationally a characteristic part of clothing for both men and women. See also denim; Levi Strauss & Co.
