Earplug,  type of ear ornament usually inserted in pierced and distended earlobes and generally worn by traditional peoples. Earplugs were the direct forerunners of todayâ€™s pierced earrings.
The Ainu of northern Japan have used plugs of fabric; in the New World, Mayan earplugs have been found made of thin jade, stone, bone, shell, wood, and metal in many sizes. The Berawan people of Borneo used plugs 3.75 inches (9.5 cm) in diameter, and the Maasai of East Africa have a stone earplug that is 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) in diameter and weighs 2 pounds 14 ounces (1.3 kg).
