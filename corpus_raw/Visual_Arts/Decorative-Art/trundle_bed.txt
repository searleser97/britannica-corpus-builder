Trundle bed, also called truckle bed,  a low bed, so called from the trundles, or casters, that were attached to the feet so that it could be pushed under the master bed when it was not in use. The bed was intended for servants, who used to sleep in their employer’s room so as to be near at hand. The framework was generally of oak, and suspension was provided by leather or canvas straps looped through holes in the sides.
The first references to the trundle bed occur in the 16th century, and the bed remained in common use until the early 19th century. The phrase is still used in some rural areas to describe a small bed of any kind, and the concept survives in the metaphor “to truckle under,” or to be subservient.
