Washstand, also called washhand stand,  from the beginning of the 19th century until well into the 20th, an essential piece of bedroom furniture. The washstand consisted of a wooden structure of varying shape and complexity intended to accommodate a large basin, a pitcher, a toothbrush jar, and various other toilet accessories, frequently including one or more chamber pots housed in cupboards at the base of the structure. The top and the “splash back” that terminated the washstand were usually of marble or tiles set into a wooden frame; occasionally the basin was suspended from a circular hole cut into the table surface. A special kind of French marble known as “St. Anne’s” was usually employed, as it resisted the action of the alkali in soap.
From the mid-19th century, washstands became more elaborate, with mirrors, shelves, and other accessories incorporated into their structure. This was largely the result of the growth of the hotel industry.
