Ottweiler porcelain,   true, or hard-paste, German porcelain produced in the Rhineland from 1763 onward. The factory was started by Étienne-Dominique Pellevé, a porcelain maker from Rouen, France, under the patronage of Prince Wilhelm Heinrich of Nassau-Saarbrücken. The Ottweiler factory was situated within the Prince’s garden. Few specimens of Ottweiler porcelain are known. After 1789 the works produced only a kind of stoneware called English Stone porcelain.
