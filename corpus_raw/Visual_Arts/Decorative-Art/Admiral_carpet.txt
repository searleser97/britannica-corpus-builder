Admiral carpet,  any of a number of 14th- or 15th-century carpets handwoven in Spain, probably at Letur or at Liétor in Murcia. The carpets were made with the Spanish knot, tied on a single warp and set in staggered rows on adjacent warps. In most cases the carpets show heraldic shields with coats of arms against a background diaper (all-over pattern) of small octagons, many of which contain eight-pointed stars; the shields of some of these carpets bear the arms of members of the Enríquez family, hereditary admirals of Castile, and others show the arms of Maria of Castile, queen of Aragon. Other Admiral carpets display merely the diapered ground without shields. The borders are complex, the outermost stripe usually a deformation of Kūfic script interspersed with tiny stylized animals, birds, and human figures.
Many of these carpets originally were very long but were shortened in the course of their use in the convents upon which they were bestowed in the 15th century and where they were preserved until removed to museums. Admiral carpets appear in several Spanish paintings, in a fresco painted about 1346 at Avignon, and in Hans Holbein the Younger’s painting Solothurn Madonna (1522; Museum of Fine Art, Solothurn, Switzerland).
