Bright-cut,  type of decorative engraving used on metal objects, especially those made of silver. The decorative designs are created by making a series of short cuts into the metal, using a polished engraving tool that causes the exposed surfaces to reflect light and give an impression of brightness.
The technique was most frequently used in England and countries influenced by the work of English silversmiths during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It is sometimes used in diamond settings to make the stones appear larger.
