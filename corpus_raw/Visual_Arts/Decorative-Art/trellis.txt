Trellis,   framework on which trees and climbing plants are trained. It is usually constructed of long, narrow wood or metal slats that are crisscrossed to produce square or diamond-shaped spaces.
Trellises may also be made of any open construction, such as untrimmed branches loosely nailed or woven together, that accomplishes the same purpose. Latticed trellises are frequently used as screens.
