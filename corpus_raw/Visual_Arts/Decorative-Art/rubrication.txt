Rubrication,  in calligraphy and typography, the use of handwriting or type of a different colour on a page, derived from the practice of setting off liturgical directions, headings of statutes, and the like in red. Specifically, it applied to the rules prescribed for the conduct of religious services as set forth in breviaries, prayer books, and missals. Though red is the traditional colour for rubrication (Latin rubricare, “to colour red”), the term is now extended to include other colours and different hues of inks either applied by hand or printed. In the manuscript period of bookmaking, the finishing touches of colour were supplied by the rubricator, or rubrisher.
