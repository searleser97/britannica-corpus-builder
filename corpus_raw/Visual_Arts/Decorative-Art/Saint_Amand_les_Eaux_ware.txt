Saint-Amand-les-Eaux ware,   tin-glazed earthenware and porcelain made in the French town of that name in the 18th and 19th centuries. The factory was begun in 1718 by Pierre-Joseph Fauquez of nearby Tournai and was continued by P.-F.-J. Fauquez after 1741 and by Jean-Baptiste Fauquez from 1771 to 1778. From 1818 the de Bettignies family (also of Tournai) directed it. The faience ranges in tone from delicate bluish white to pale duck-egg blue to grayish blue and bluish purple. The technique of painting in white overglaze pigment on the blue-white glaze, called bianco sopra bianco (“white on white”), was effectively employed; purple and blue were also used in decoration, which mostly took the form of sketchy flowers, figures, and scrollwork, sometimes in the “Chinese” style. Soft-paste porcelain was made from 1771 under Jean-Baptiste Fauquez and later under the de Bettignies family; among the latter’s products were forgeries of both French and English porcelain.
