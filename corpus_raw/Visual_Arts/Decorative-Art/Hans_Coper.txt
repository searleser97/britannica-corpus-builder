Hans Coper,  (born April 8, 1920, Chemnitz, Germanyâ€”died June 16, 1981, Somerset, England), German-born British potter who was a dominant figure in European pottery and who perpetuated a distinctly European tradition, in contrast to the Asian-influenced ceramics produced by the British potter Bernard Leach and his school.
Coper studied engineering in Germany before turning to painting and sculpture. He then went to Britain and, inspired by Lucie Rie, turned to pottery, producing work that was sculptural and sometimes figurative. Coper taught at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts and at the Royal College of Art, influencing many students of ceramics. In 1969 the Victoria and Albert Museum chose him as the first living potter to become the subject of a major exhibition.
