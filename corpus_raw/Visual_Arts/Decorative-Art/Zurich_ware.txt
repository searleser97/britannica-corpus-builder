Z端rich ware,   faience (tin-glazed earthenware), faience fine (lead-glazed earthenware), and porcelain made at a factory near Z端rich founded in 1763 by Salomon Gessner and others. The faience was at first painted in a style similar to that of the porcelain, but after 1775 both the faience and the faience fine were decorated by means of transfer printing. Two kinds of floral decoration of tableware prevailed: formal, or indianische Blumen, and naturalistic, or deutsche Blumen. Other decoration included delicately designed and painted Swiss landscapes. Porcelain figures were also made, in some cases modelled by Johann Valentin Sonnenschein, who worked at Z端rich from about 1775 until 1779. Although the keynote of Z端rich ware is finesse and restraint, at least one elaborate dinner service, with the full repertory of basketwork, shells, dolphins, and the like, was made there in about 1770. The factory closed toward the end of the 19th century.
