Damask,   patterned textile, deriving its name from the fine patterned fabrics produced in Damascus (Syria) in the European Middle Ages. True damask was originally wholly of silk, but gradually the name came to be applied to a certain type of patterned fabric regardless of fibre. Single damask has one set each of warps and wefts, or fillings, and may be woven in one or two colours; compound or double damask has a greater number of fillings. Damask is woven on a Jacquard loom, the satin field being produced by floats of warp that pass over from two to seven and in some instances nine fillings. The design is a plain or taffeta weave, the warp and filling being at right angles that create less lustre than the satin areas.
Crusaders who had passed through Damascus introduced the fabric to Europe in the 11th century, and the weaving of linen damask became established in flax-growing countriesâ€”in France, for example, by the mid-13th century. The Flemish city of Courtrai was noted for its table linen in the 15th century, as was Haarlem, Neth., in the 17th and 18th centuries. William III established damask weaving in Ireland in the late 17th century.
Antique damask was 18 to 25 inches (45 to 63 cm) wide, the distance a shuttle carrying the weft threads could be thrown by hand from selvage to selvage through the raised warps. Widths of 50 inches (127 cm) and more could be produced by mechanized weaving, which was introduced about 1835.
