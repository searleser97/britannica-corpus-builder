Thomas Chippendale, II,  (born c. 1749—died  1822), son of the cabinetmaker Thomas Chippendale, who succeeded his father as head of the family workshop.
Until the retirement of Thomas Haig in 1796, the firm traded under the title Chippendale and Haig. Though the business was declared bankrupt in 1804, the younger Chippendale continued operations at St. Martin’s Lane and opened an additional shop in the Haymarket in 1814, which was removed to Jermyn Street in 1821. The firm continued to make high-quality furniture, undertaking such work as upholstery and paper hanging; they supplied fine Regency furniture to Harewood and to Stourhead House, Wiltshire. Like his father, he also was a member of the Society of Arts, exhibiting five pictures at the Royal Academy between 1784 and 1801.
