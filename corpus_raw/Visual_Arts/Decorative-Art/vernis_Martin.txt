Vernis Martin,   lustrous lacquer substitute widely used in the 18th century to decorate furniture and such personal articles as brisé fans and snuffboxes. The process of adding bronze or gold powder to green varnish was perfected by the Martin family (q.v.), hence its name vernis Martin (“Martin varnish”). Highly praised by Voltaire, it was developed to imitate East Asian lacquerware being imported into France during the Louis XV period. Vernis Martin was made in several colours, green and a golden red being the most characteristic. See also lacquerwork.
