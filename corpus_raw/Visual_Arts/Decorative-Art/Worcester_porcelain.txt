Worcester porcelain,   pottery ware made, under various managements, at a factory in Worcester, Eng., from 1751 until the present; the factory became the Worcester Royal Porcelain Company in 1862. Although the technical level of Worcester has been high at all periods, that between 1752 and 1783 marks the highest level of excellence. This era is called the Wall period, after John Wall, the founder of Worcester’s porcelain industry; it embraces the directorship of William Davies as well.
Of the many Worcester styles of the Wall period, a few examples may be singled out: painting in underglaze blue on vessels either molded or plain; from about 1756, transfer-printed designs in black, over the glaze, and later in blue under the glaze; transfer-printed outlines filled in by hand with overglaze colours by semiskilled workers; Japanese patterns of conventionalized plum blossoms, chrysanthemums, fish, and the like on panels alternating with panels of a wide range of formal or geometric patterns; and exotic birds, also in “reserves,” or panels, on coloured grounds, especially a deep-blue ground heightened with gilding.
The ground colours of Worcester were an especial achievement, several shades being developed in emulation of Sèvres. Blue and other background colours were often painted in a way suggestive of fish scales. The Worcester palette also included a near-vermilion; reddish brown; pink and claret; sea green, leaf green, and pea green; pale yellow; turquoise; blues from pale sky to deepest cobalt. The gilding that often formed scrolls and curls defining the designs was delicate. In the 19th century Worcester remained one of the principal makers of ornamental porcelain, with many designs inspired by the Aesthetic Movement. In the 20th century their production included the American birds of Dorothy Doughty.
