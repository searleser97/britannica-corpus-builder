Paisley,   textile pattern characterized by colourful, curved abstract figures; it is named for the shawls manufactured at the town of Paisley, Scot. When, about 1800, patterned shawls made from the soft fleece of the Kashmir goat began to be imported to Britain from India, machine-woven equivalents were made at Paisley to supply the insatiable demand that had been created for “cashmere” shawls. Paisley shawls, in silk and cotton and later in wool, with sober colouring, were beautiful in their own right. Their rich, abstract, curvilinear patterns, modified from their Kashmir counterparts and deriving ultimately from Mughal art, have continued to be widely adopted in modern textiles, especially for clothing. A motif resembling an enlarged comma (well-known in Mughal decorative art) is the one by which most people recognize a paisley pattern.
