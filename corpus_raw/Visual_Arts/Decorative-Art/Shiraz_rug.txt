Shīrāz rug,  handwoven floor covering made in the district around the city of Shīrāz in southern Iran. The best known are the Qashqāʾī rugs, products of nomadic peoples. A group of tribes—some Arab, some Turkish, forming the Khamseh Confederation—weaves rugs somewhat similar to the Qashqāʾī pieces in a variety of patterns, as do the inhabitants of certain Iranian weaving villages in the locality of Shīrāz. One may find both the symmetrical and asymmetrical knots from this area.
Shīrāz rugs frequently display rectilinear medallions in polygonal or diamond form, often with three diamonds connected by a “pole.” Arrangements of manifold narrow stripes and small geometric figures are also common. The foundation is of wool, and the pile may consist of wool softer to the touch than is common in other parts of Persia.
