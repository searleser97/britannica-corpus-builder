azulejo,  (from Arabic al-zulayj, “little stone”), Spanish and later principally Portuguese tiles produced from the 14th century onward. At first the term was used to denote only North African mosaics, but it became the accepted word for an entirely decorated tile about 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) square. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal imported azulejo tiles from Spain, and their use was widespread in religious architecture, such as that of the Coimbra cathedral, and on the facades of private buildings. About 1550 Flemish artists in Lisbon attempted the production of tiles, and the industry developed during the reigns of Philip II, III, and IV to become independent of Spain, which virtually ceased to manufacture them in the 18th century. Portuguese exports of tiles to the Azores, Madeira, and Brazil began in the 17th century. Azulejos produced in Puebla, Mexico, later became the most outstanding in the Western Hemisphere.
Initially, one-colour versions of the tiles were used in Portugal in decorative chessboard patterns. Variations included polychrome designs; scenes with military or religious themes; and humorous singeries, which depicted monkeys in human roles. During the height of the azulejo’s popularity, from about 1690 to 1750, many exterior and interior walls were faced by complex continuous picture tiles.
