Tara brooch,   fine example of a Celtic ring brooch, found on the seashore at Bettystown, south of Drogheda, and now preserved in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin. The Tara brooch, probably dating from the 8th century, is of white bronze and consists of a large circle with about half of the centre empty and the other half filled in with sunken panels ornamented in extremely delicate filigree.
On the reverse side there is elaborate chasing consisting mainly of Celtic spiral forms and delicate interlaced patterns. A pin thrust through the brooch attached the whole to the garment; it is of exaggerated length with an elaborately decorated head. The brooch was probably worn on the shoulder with the pin pointing upward.
