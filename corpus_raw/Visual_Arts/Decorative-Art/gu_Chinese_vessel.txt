Gu, Wade-Giles romanization ku,  type of Chinese vessel, it was a tall wine beaker with a trumpet-shaped top, a restricted centre section, and a slightly flared base; the whole silhouette was unusually taut and graceful. Decoration found on the gu includes snakes, cicadas, the taotie, or monster mask, and the gui, or dragonlike monster with curled tail and gaping jaw.
The bronze gu was produced during the Shang and early Zhou dynasties (18thâ€“11th century bc). A pottery form of the gu also existed and was popular during the early Shang dynasty, before gradually disappearing during the early and middle Zhou dynasty. This pottery form of the gu was sometimes used in funerary rites. It is believed that there may also have been a wooden form of the gu during the Zhou dynasty.
