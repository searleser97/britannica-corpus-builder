Giambattista Bodoni,  (born Feb. 16, 1740, Saluzzo, Piedmont [Italy]—died  Nov. 29, 1813, Parma, French Empire [now in Italy]), Italian printer who designed several modern typefaces, one of which bears his name and is in common use today.
The son of a printer, Bodoni left home as a boy to go to Rome, where he served an apprenticeship at the press of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, the missionary arm of the Roman Catholic church. In 1768 he was asked to assume management of the Royal Press (Stamperia Reale), the press of the Duke of Parma. There he produced Italian, Greek, and Latin books and printed materials for court use.
Bodoni at first employed old-style typefaces with much decorative detail. He was gradually won over to the typographical theories of a French printer, Pierre Didot, however, and by 1787 was printing pages almost devoid of decoration and containing modern typefaces of his own design. The typeface that retained the Bodoni name appeared in 1790. Of the many books that he produced during this period, the best known is his Manuale tipografico (1788; “Inventory of Types”), a folio collection of 291 roman and italic typefaces, along with samples of Russian, Greek, and other types. A second edition of his book was published by his widow in 1818.
By 1790 Bodoni had become widely known; important travelers visited his press, and collectors sought his books. The Duke of Parma gave him a larger press and more independence; he no longer had to confine himself to the duke’s projects. Although his books were better known for their beauty and typographical excellence than for textual accuracy, he printed many important works, the most famous of which were his fine editions of the writings of Horace and Virgil in 1791 and 1793, respectively, and Homer’s Iliad in 1808. The last years of his life brought Bodoni international fame. He received compliments from the pope and was honoured with a pension by Napoleon Bonaparte.
