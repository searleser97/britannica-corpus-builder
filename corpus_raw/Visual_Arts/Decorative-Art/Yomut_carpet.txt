Yomut carpet, Yomut also spelled Yomud,  floor covering handwoven by the Yomut Turkmen of Turkmenistan, usually of good to excellent quality. In contrast to Tekke carpets, there is considerable variety of design among the larger Yomut carpets. Many have diagonal rows in which a single diamond- or lozenge-shaped motif is repeated with diverse colourings. This motif may be edged with latch hooks; but the most characteristic edging is composed of a graduated group of vertical bands, each of which is graced with tiny florets. A second series of carpets has vertical rows of parti-coloured octagons on which appear tiny, stylized two-headed dogs. The border is usually a highly geometric vine design on white; and end aprons are covered with stylized designs of leaves and stems or, in some cases, elaborate flowering plants. Field colouring ranges from reddish brown to plum shades, with white being used for highlights.
A weaving most common among the Yomuts is a five-sided decorative panel resembling a torba, or storage-bag, face, usually ornamented with a diamond lattice or a row of conventionalized fir trees. Yomut tent bands (used to decorate tents) and brocaded flat-surfaced rugs are also noteworthy. The larger Yomut carpets are made entirely of wool or goat hair, usually in symmetrical knotting; in small pieces, for which asymmetrical knotting is used more frequently, white cotton has been combined occasionally with wool in the weft.
