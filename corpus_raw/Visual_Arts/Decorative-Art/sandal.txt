Sandal,  type of footwear consisting of a sole secured to the foot by straps over the instep, toes, or ankle. The oldest known example of a sandal dates from about 10,900 years before the present, is made of sagebrush bark, and comes from what is now the U.S. state of Oregon. Sandals have also been found in ancient Egypt, where only important personages wore sandals. Egyptian sandals were made of papyrus and other materials, including leather and wood. The ancient Greeks and Romans also wore sandals; the Greek god Hermes (known to the Romans as Mercury) is often portrayed with winged sandals. However, with the rise of Christianity, sandals fell into disrepute, as church leaders thought sandals left women’s feet too naked.
In modern times, sandals have been extremely popular, especially in warm climates. With the growth of mass shoe manufacturing, sandals have been produced in a variety of styles and materials—from the simple thong to the platform sandal. The term sandal has also been used to refer to a woman’s low-cut shoe or light slipper.
