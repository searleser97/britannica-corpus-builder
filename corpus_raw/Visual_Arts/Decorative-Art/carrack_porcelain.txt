Carrack porcelain,  Chinese blue-and-white export pieces from the reign of the emperor Wan-li (1573â€“1620) during the Ming period.
During the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company rose to world prominence by trading fine goods. A particularly popular Chinese export became kraakporselein (named after the Portuguese carraca, or cargo ship). The vitreous-looking ware is decorated in a grayish-blue colour, is spontaneously painted, and generally features subjects such as deer, ducks in pairs, rocks, and landscapes. The ware had considerable influence on European pottery and taste; it was copied at Delft, Netherlands, and elsewhere and appeared in many Dutch still-life paintings and interiors.
