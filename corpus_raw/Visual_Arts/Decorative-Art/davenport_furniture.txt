Davenport,   in modern usage, a large upholstered settee, but in the 18th century a compact desk having deep drawers on the right side and dummy drawer fronts on the left side. The sloping top of the davenport concealed a fitted well, the front of which protruded beyond the drawers and was supported by a pair of columns on a base, or plinth. The back of the writing area was normally flat and might be protected on three sides by a pierced brass gallery.
Some versions of the early davenport were fitted with a writing slide that extended the writing area at the front or side. The first desk of this type was made by the English firm of Gillow for a Captain Davenport in the late 18th century.
