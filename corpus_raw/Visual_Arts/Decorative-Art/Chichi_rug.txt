Chichi rug,  small, handmade floor covering woven in a cluster of villages in the vicinity of the Azerbaijanian city of Kuba. Most rugs labeled as Chichi in the West are characterized by a particular border in which large rosettes are flanked by diagonal bars, while the field is ordinarily dark blue and covered with small, repeating geometric figures, often of several types. Chichi rugs are among the more finely knotted Caucasian rugs, and many have cotton wefts. Many of these rugs have a faint greenish cast, and a few may be long, ranging around 12 feet (3.6 metres).
Russian sources identify a number of Chichi variants. It is unclear whether rugs woven in the villages of Syrt Chichi and Divichi are the types usually labeled as Chichis.
