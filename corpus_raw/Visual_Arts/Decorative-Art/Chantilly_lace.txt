Chantilly lace,  bobbin lace made at Chantilly, north of Paris, from the 17th century;  the silk laces for which Chantilly is famous date from the 18th century.  In the 19th century both black and white laces were made in matte silk.  Half-stitch was used  for the solid design areas, giving the lace a light and airy appearance.  The background was a handmade net worked in continuity with the design.
By 1840 good imitations were being produced on the warp frame, pusher, and Leavers machines.  Both the machine-made and handmade versions were fashionable from mid-century, when shawls and mantles of Chantilly lace were worn over crinolines and, later, bustles.  Designs featured naturalistic flowers such as roses and tulips entwined with ribbon bands, all outlined by strands of thick untwisted silk.
