Blow molding,   in glass production, method of forming an article of glass by blowing molten glass into a mold. This operation is performed with the aid of a hollow metal tube that has a mouthpiece at one end. A gob of molten glass gathered onto the opposite end of the tube is enlarged by a bubble of air blown into it through the tube. This preliminary shape is then lowered into a mold and inflated by blowing until it has assumed the desired shape and pattern. The mold may be constructed of one piece, in which case it is sheared off the glass article, or it may be an open-and-shut device comprised of two parts, which allows the mold to be removed and reused.
Syrian glassworkers appear to have developed blow molding in the 1st century bc. The first known mold-blown glass vessels bear the signature of Syrian masters, who used a ductile variety of soda glass that was particularly suitable for this method of shaping glassware. Roman glassmakers adopted the procedure between the 1st and 3rd centuries ad, using it to manufacture both luxury and domestic glass vessels. This technique of shaping glass made possible the low-cost production of fine decorative glassware, often with slogans molded in. Today much blow-molded glass is produced by machines that use compressed air for blowing the glass into molds. See also glassblowing.
