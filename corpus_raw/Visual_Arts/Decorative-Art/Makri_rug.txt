Makri rug,  floor covering handwoven in or near the coastal village of Fethiye, southwest Turkey. These are rare, comparatively small rugs with rather simple, bold designs and rich, vibrant colours.
Most show one, two, or three longitudinal panels, which may have different ground colours. Each panel may contain a series of large blossoms or a rod from which sprout pairs of winglike leaves.
