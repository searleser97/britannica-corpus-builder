Carver chair,  American spool chair with a rush seat and turned (shaped on a lathe) legs that rise above the seat level to frame the back and to support the armrests. The back normally contained three vertical spindles and was topped with decorative finials.
Carver chairs were named after John Carver (c. 1576â€“1621), founder and first governor of the Plymouth colony in America. A chair of this design, reportedly owned by the governor, was displayed in Plymouth, Mass., in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
