Taʿlīq script,  in Arabic calligraphy, cursive style of lettering developed in Iran in the 10th century. It is thought to have been the creation of Ḥasan ibn Ḥusayn ʿAlī of Fars, but, because Khwājah ʿAbd al-Malik Buk made such vast improvements, the invention is often attributed to him. The rounded forms and exaggerated horizontal strokes that characterize the taʿlīq letters were derived primarily from the riqāʿ script. The ornateness and sloping quality of the written line had roots in the tawqīʿ script of Ibn Muqlah (died 940). Designed specifically to meet the needs of the Persian language, taʿlīq was used widely for royal as well as daily correspondence until the 14th century, when it was replaced by nastaʿlīq.
