Alfred Stevens, in full Alfred George Stevens,  (born Dec. 31, 1817, Blandford Forum, Dorset, Eng.—died May 1, 1875, London), English designer, painter, and sculptor notable for the Michelangelesque vigour of his work, particularly in his interior decorations for the dining room of the Dorchester House, home of the collector Robert Stayner Holford, and his design for the Wellington monument in St. Paul’s Cathedral in London (1862). Through his assistants and pupils, his work and ideas had a strong impact on architectural sculpture as a decorative ensemble, principles that were essential to the Arts and Crafts movement and the “New Sculpture” associated with it.
