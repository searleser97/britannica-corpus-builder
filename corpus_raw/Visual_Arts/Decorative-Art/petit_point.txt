Petit point,   form of canvas embroidery similar to cross-stitch embroidery (q.v.), but even finer because of its small scale. The squareness and regularity of the outlines of the forms represented is less apparent at ordinary viewing distance. The stitch used—also called petit point or tent stitch—is worked either in diagonal or horizontal rows across the intersection of the canvas threads. The thread is carried back from stitch to stitch in a uniform manner to ensure that the pull of the thread at the front is consistent.
Petit point was widely used in France in the 17th and early 18th centuries, particularly for pole screens and upholstery covering.
