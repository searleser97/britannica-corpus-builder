Thomas Affleck,  (born 1745, Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Scot.—died March 5, 1795, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.), American cabinetmaker considered to be outstanding among the Philadelphia craftsmen working in the Chippendale style during the 18th century. Affleck is especially noted for the elaborately carved forms produced by his shop.
Probably trained in England, Affleck settled in Philadelphia by invitation in 1763, producing tables, chairs, sofas, and case furniture for Gov. John Penn and other leading Philadelphia citizens. Affleck was a Quaker and a Loyalist and as such would not get involved in the American Revolution (1775–83). He was arrested as a Tory in 1777 and banished to Virginia for more than seven months. Nevertheless, he continued to receive important commissions. His son, Lewis G. Affleck, was unable to maintain the business after his father’s death.
Works attributed to Affleck, showing the Marlborough-style leg (a straight, grooved type having a block foot) are in the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Boston Museum of Fine Arts; and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City.
