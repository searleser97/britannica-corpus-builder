Rockingham ware,   English earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain made at Swinton, Yorkshire, in a factory on the estate of the Marquess of Rockingham. The pottery was started in 1745, but it was not until 1826 that it assumed the name Rockingham. It continued to operate until 1842. Rockingham porcelain, light in weight, was eclectic in style, much of it in an extravagant revived Rococo style of questionable taste but always well made and finished. A manganese-brown glaze called “Rockingham glaze” was used on the stoneware. From c. 1840 to 1900, U.S. factories such as that in East Liverpool, Ohio, made a brown-glazed pottery also called Rockingham.
