Engraved glass,   glassware decorated with finely carved, three-dimensional patterns or pictures. The most common engraving technique involves incising a design into glass with a rapidly spinning copper wheel fed with abrasives. Other techniques include diamond scribing and stipple engraving; the former produces very delicate lines, and the latter creates shaded patterns. A design engraved in the surface of a glass article may be left rough, etched with acid, or polished. The Romans engaged in wheel engraving as early as 1 bc, producing glassware characterized by massive cut shapes. From about ad 700 to 1400 IslƒÅmic glassworkers significantly refined engraving. In addition to perpetuating the earlier modes of facet and boss cutting, they also introduced linear intaglio and relief cutting.
