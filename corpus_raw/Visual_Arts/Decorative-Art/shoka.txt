Shōka,   (Japanese: “living flowers”), in classical Japanese floral art, a three-branched asymmetrical style that is a simplification of the ancient stylized temple floral art of rikka. The serenely balanced shōka arrangements are triangular, based on three main lines: shin, the central “truth” branch; soe, supporting branches; and tai, branches placed near the base to balance the structure. They symbolize heaven, man, and earth; thus the arrangement represents the whole universe.
Basic to shōka designs is the maintenance of natural order; e.g., varieties of plants native to mountain regions are placed above lowland varieties; the elements are harmonized according to season; and plants are hung or placed in an upright position, as they naturally grow. Other rules cover the proportion of plant material to the vase (1.5 times the height of the vase) and the numbers of branches used (always an uneven number).
Shōka incorporates many of the structural rules and classical feeling of the ancient Ikenobō school. The celebrated painter Sōami and the great art patron and shogun Yoshimasa were supporters of the shōka style as early as the 15th century, yet it did not reach its peak of popularity and artistic development until the 18th century. The shōka style is sometimes referred to as seika, ikebana, or Ikenobō, although these terms also have other, more specific meanings.
