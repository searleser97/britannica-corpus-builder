Godefroid de Claire, also called Godefroid de Huy,  (flourished 1130â€“50, Huy-sur-le-Meuse, Belg.), important Belgian Romanesque goldsmith and enamelist of the Mosan school. Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been most active in the service of the abbot of Stavelot Abbey. Among the best known works attributed to him are a bronze aquamanile (ewer) reliquary of St. Alexander (c. 1145) and two enamel plaques showing the baptism of Christ and the Crucifixion.
