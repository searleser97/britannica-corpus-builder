Alicatado,   mosaic formed of polygonal, coloured glazed tiles. Made up into geometric patterns, they have been used mostly for paving Spanish and Moorish patios but also for wall surfaces. The expansion of the lands under Christian control in Spain in the 13th century led to a mixture of Gothic and Islāmic styles (known as the Mudéjar style), in which alicatado was much used by Spanish craftsmen. These traditional patterns continue to be used, especially where Spanish or Arabic influences are strong.
