Rose cut,  method of faceting gemstones so that the base of the stone is wide, flat, and unfaceted, whereas the top of the stone is domed and covered with triangular facets. Often in two rows, the facets are grouped so that the very highest part of the stone terminates in a point. Once used extensively for diamonds, this style of cut today is restricted to smaller stones.
