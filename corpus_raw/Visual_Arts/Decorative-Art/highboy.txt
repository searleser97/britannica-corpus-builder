Highboy, also called tallboy,  a high or double chest of drawers (known technically as a chest-on-stand and a chest-on-chest, respectively). The name highboy is derived from a corruption of the French bois (“wood”) and became common in English in the late 1600s.
The prototype of the highboy was the chest of drawers on a stand with turned legs (i.e., shaped on a lathe). The lower section is usually wider than the upper and has three drawers of the same size. The upper section generally consists of another set of three drawers and, on top of them, two or three smaller drawers to complete the sequence. The piece is topped with a cornice. The two sections are divided by wide moldings, in which there is sometimes inserted a slide shelf. Although usually flat-fronted, highboys were occasionally made in a serpentine shape. Later versions were sometimes topped by a curved, or swan-necked, pediment. The feet were usually of the curved ogee, or elongated S, variety, and the handles and keyholes of decorated brass.
