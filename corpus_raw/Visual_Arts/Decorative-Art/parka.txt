Parka,  hip-length, hooded jacket traditionally made of caribou, seal, or other fur, worn as an outer garment by Arctic peoples.
The modern parka is often adapted for such sports as skiing. It is usually made of synthetic, water-repellent material, often filled with batting or goose or duck down for warmth.
