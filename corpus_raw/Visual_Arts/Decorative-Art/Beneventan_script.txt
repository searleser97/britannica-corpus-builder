Beneventan script,   in calligraphy, southern Italian hand, cultivated in the mother house of the Benedictine order at Montecassino. It has a peculiar jerky rhythm and retains individual cursive forms, which together with many abbreviations and ligatures make for difficult reading. Nevertheless, from humble vernacular beginnings, it rose to be an admired literary script and held that position for more than 500 years, well into the 13th century.
