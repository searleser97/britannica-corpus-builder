Carlton House table, also called Carlton House desk, or Carlton House writing table,  writing table, normally constructed of mahogany or satinwood, characterized by a stepped, or tiered, superstructure of drawers and pigeonholes running along the back and curving around the sides of the top, leaving clear only the side nearest the sitter. The curve of the superstructure is emphasized by small concave cupboard doors, and the sides are commonly stepped or curved down toward the front. A brass rim, or gallery, runs around the outer edge of the superstructure. Introduced in the 1780s, the Carlton House table continued to be produced into the 20th century, though its elegance of craftsmanship and use of expensive materials made it relatively rare. It was named after the London home of the prince of Wales (later George IV), for whom the first specimen was made.
