Turkey work,   form of knotted embroidery practiced in England from the 16th century to the mid-18th century, but especially in the 17th century. Used for upholstery and table covers, it was worked in imitation of Turkish carpets, which are known from paintings to have been imported to England from the 16th century. The designs were usually of geometrically stylized flowers. A document from the reign of William III (1689–1702) gives the number of Turkey-work chairs made per annum as 60,000. Because so few examples have survived in England, while examples have been found abroad—for example, in Italy—it may be deduced that Turkey work was an export item.
