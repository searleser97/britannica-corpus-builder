Gipon,   tunic worn under armour in the 14th century and later adapted for civilian use. At first a tight-fitting garment worn next to the shirt and buttoned down the front, it came down to the knees and was padded and waisted.
Later in the century the gipon became shorter, and it was replaced by the doublet in the 15th and 16th centuries. For a time it was called a pourpoint.
