Lindisfarne Gospels,   manuscript (MS. Cotton Nero D.IV.; British Museum, London) illuminated in the late 7th or 8th century in the Hiberno-Saxon style. The book was probably made for Eadfrith, the bishop of Lindisfarne from 698 to 721. Attributed to the Northumbrian school, the Lindisfarne Gospels show the fusion of Irish, classical, and Byzantine elements of manuscript illumination.
