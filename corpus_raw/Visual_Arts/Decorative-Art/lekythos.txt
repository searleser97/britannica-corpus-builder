Lekythos, plural lekythoi,  in ancient Greek pottery, oil flask used at baths and gymnasiums and for funerary offerings, characterized by a long cylindrical body gracefully tapered to the base and a narrow neck with a loop-shaped handle. The word lekythos (as well as its plural form, lekythoi) is known from ancient sources. The Athenians seem to have used the term generically to mean any small oil flask. The lekythos appeared about 590 bce decorated in the black-figure technique. After about 530 bce the red-figure technique was occasionally used, but until about 480 the majority of lekythoi continued to be decorated in black-figure. A new technique in which lekythoi were painted with a white ground bearing figurative scenes then came into use. A large number of this style are known, largely from Athenian graves, as the white ground paint was fragile and not suitable for heavy use. These works exhibit a fine level of detail, and the artisans who painted them include some of the masters of the red-figure technique. For everyday use, red-figure and entirely black-glazed lekythoi remained the most-durable versions.
