Wainscot chair, also called panel chair or joined chair,  chair, usually made of oak, and named for the fine grade of oak usually used for wainscot paneling. Like many terms used in reference to furniture, it has a general and a particular meaning. The general sense is any heavy wooden chair of fairly simple construction. The more specific reference is to a wooden chair with turned (shaped on a lathe) front legs, square-sectioned back legs, arm supports, a simple, unupholstered seat, and a slightly raked panel back, usually with some form of incised decoration and sometimes topped with a carved cresting. Wainscot chairs were a popular feature of early 17th-century English and colonial American households, where they were an upscale alternative to the more common turned chairs.
