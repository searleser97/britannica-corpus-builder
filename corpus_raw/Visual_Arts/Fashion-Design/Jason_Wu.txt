Jason Wu,  (born September 27, 1982, Taipei, Taiwan), Taiwanese-born fashion designer known for his sophisticated and well-crafted creations.
In the early 1990s Wu’s family moved from Taiwan to Vancouver. His mother hired a fashion student there to teach her young son, who was “always sketching and drawing,” the art of pattern cutting and sewing. When Wu was a teenager, he began designing for dolls, and in 2000 he created Fashion Royalty, a high-end line of dolls. He later attended the Parsons School of Design in New York City. After three years of study there, Wu worked (2005) as an intern for noted fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, whom he called his role model. In 2006 Wu established his own eponymous label, which reflected a design aesthetic that he characterized as feminine. Manhattan socialites, including Vogue contributing editor Marina Rust and business tycoon Ivanka Trump, were early fans of his polished ready-to-wear line.
In 2009 Wu garnered international attention when U.S. first lady Michelle Obama wore one of his designs to the balls feting the inauguration of her husband, Pres. Barack Obama. According to Wu, 100 hours of workmanship went into the intricate dress, a floor-length white silk chiffon column featuring handmade organza flowers and Swarovski crystals. Following the inauguration festivities, Michelle further raised his profile by appearing in his designs on a number of other occasions. Her patronage helped establish Wu as a major designer in the fashion industry. In 2012 he designed a limited-edition collection of affordable clothing and accessories for the mass-market retailer Target; the collection largely sold out within hours of its release. From 2013 to 2018 Wu served as artistic director of women’s wear at Hugo Boss.
