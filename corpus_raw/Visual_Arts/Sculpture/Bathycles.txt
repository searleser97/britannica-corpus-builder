Bathycles,  (flourished 6th century bc, Magnesia, Ionia [now in Turkey]), ancient Greek sculptor whose only known work was a marble altar built around an ancient statue of Apollo at Amyclae. This work was commissioned by the Spartans and was described by the 2nd-century-ad Greek chronicler Pausanias as being adorned with mythological reliefs and free-standing supporting figures. Some architectural fragments, but virtually none of the sculptures, have been recovered.
