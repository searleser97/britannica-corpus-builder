Bartolomé Ordóñez,  (born c. 1490, Burgos, Castile [Spain]—died 1520, Carrara, Papal States [Italy]), sculptor who was one of the originators of the Spanish school of Renaissance sculpture. Influenced by the masters of the Italian Renaissance, he evolved his own pure style, which was widely imitated after his early death.
A member of a wealthy family, Ordóñez apparently studied under Andrea Sansovino in Florence, though not much is known of his early years. It is known that he collaborated with Diego de Siloé on the Caraccioli Altarpiece (1514–15; San Giovanni a Carbonara) and worked on the marble tomb of Andrea Bonifacio (c. 1518; SS. Severino e Sosia), both in Naples. He probably established himself in Barcelona about 1515. He was commissioned by the Barcelona Cathedral in 1517 to make wooden reliefs for the choir stalls and marble reliefs for the trascoro (a screen wall at the rear of the choir).
Ordóñez knew the work of Donatello, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michelangelo. His The Adoration of the Magi, the principal panel of the Caraccioli Altarpiece, is a splendid example of his mastery of Renaissance style in its clear organization of figures, careful perspective, and distinct rhythm. This panel and his other masterpieces profoundly influenced the major Neapolitan sculptors of the 16th century.
