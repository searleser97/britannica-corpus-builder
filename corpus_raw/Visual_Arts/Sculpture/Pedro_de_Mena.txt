Pedro de Mena, in full Pedro de Mena y Medrano,  (baptized Aug. 20, 1628, Granada, Spain—died Oct. 13, 1688, Málaga), Spanish sculptor who created many statues and busts of polychromed wood for churches in Spain and Latin America and whose work typifies the late Baroque.
Beginning as a student of his father, the sculptor Alonso de Mena, Pedro worked in the studio of Alonso Cano from 1652 to 1657. After Cano departed for Madrid, Pedro went in 1658 to Málaga to begin work on 40 choir stalls for the cathedral there, a project that took four years to complete. Establishing a studio in Málaga, he remained there the rest of his life, except for a visit to Madrid and Toledo in 1663, when he was named sculptor of the Toledo cathedral. His studio produced innumerable works for local churches and for churches in Madrid, Granada, and Córdoba.
Mena’s style is heavily indebted to Cano but is more theatrical and realistic. Unfortunately, many of his sculptures at Málaga were destroyed in the riots of 1931. Among these was his masterful “Virgin of Bethlehem” in the Church of Santo Domingo, which combined dignity and playfulness, seriousness and extroverted grace, typical of Andalusia. Works that have survived include the simple but very moving statue of “St. Francis of Assisi in His Tomb” in the Toledo cathedral, and a “Dolorosa” at Cuenca cathedral and another “Dolorosa” (1673, Madrid, Descalzas Reales), both expressing their motif with remarkable poignancy.
