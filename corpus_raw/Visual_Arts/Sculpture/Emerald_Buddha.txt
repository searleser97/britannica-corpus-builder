Emerald Buddha,  statue of the Buddha carved of green jasper and dating from around the 15th century.
The Emerald Buddha was originally at a temple in the town of Chiang Rai (now in Northern Thailand) until 1436, when it was removed to Chiang Mai. It was kept there until Setthathirat I, king of Chiang Mai and Laos, moved the statue to his capital, Vientiane (now in Laos), in 1560. There he built a majestic temple to house it. When King Rama I (reigned over Siam [now Thailand] 1782â€“1809) captured the town of Vientiane, he returned the Emerald Buddha to Thailand. Rama I established Bangkok as his capital, and in 1784 the image was placed there in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha.
The Emerald Buddha has seasonal costumes, which are changed ceremonially three times a year.
