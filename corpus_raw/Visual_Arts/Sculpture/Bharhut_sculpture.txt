Bharhut sculpture,  early Indian sculpture of the Shunga period (mid-2nd century bce) that decorated the great stupa, or relic mound, of Bharhut, in Madhya Pradesh state. It has been largely destroyed, and most of the existing remains—railings and entrance gateways—are now in the Indian Museum in Kolkata (Calcutta). The Bharhut style, though at times archaic and primitive in its conception, marks the beginnings of a tradition of Buddhist narrative relief and decoration of sacred buildings that continued for several centuries. Sculptures similar to the Bharhut remains are located throughout northern India, suggesting that the Bharhut site was the main place for this style type.
The flat planes, rather stiffly posed figures, and precise, elegant detailing of the ornamentation suggest continuance in stone of an earlier tradition in wood. Some of the uprights bear in relief standing figures of yakshas and yakshis (male and female nature deities) that have been pressed into the service of the Buddhist religion; a frequent motif is a woman embracing a tree.
The stone railing, which imitates wooden post-and-rail construction, is decorated with medallions and lunates, most of them filled with the lotus ornament and some of them centred by the head of a man or woman. Other railing medallions and the coping depict Jataka stories (legends of the Buddha’s previous births) and events of the Buddha’s life. Since these are labeled, Bharhut sculpture is indispensable for an understanding of Buddhist iconography. As in all Indian sculpture before the 1st century ce, the Buddha is represented by a symbol such as a wheel, empty throne, or umbrella, never in human form. The composition is simple, even naïve, with overlapping figures used in an attempt to distinguish planes. Animals appearing in the sculptures are treated with the sympathetic understanding characteristic of Indian art at all periods.
