Andrea Riccio, original name Andrea Briosco,  also called Andrea Crispus,  (born c. 1470, Padua, Republic of Venice—died  1532, Padua), Renaissance sculptor and goldsmith best known for his miniature sculptures in bronze.
Riccio was trained in the workshop of Bartolomeo Bellano and was active principally as a bronze sculptor. He executed the great paschal candlestick and two bronze reliefs for S. Antonio at Padua (1507–16) and the Girolamo della Torre monument in S. Fermo at Verona (1516–21). The bronze reliefs from the latter are now in the Louvre, Paris. The style and imagery of both works are strongly influenced by Paduan Humanism. Riccio was also a prolific maker of bronze statuettes. For the most part his subjects were drawn from classical mythology. Unlike the statuettes of his contemporary Antico at Mantua, Riccio’s are romantic in treatment, with marked individuality and expressive character. Outstanding examples are the Boy Milking a Goat in the Bargello, Florence, the Warrior on Horseback in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the Arion in the Louvre.
