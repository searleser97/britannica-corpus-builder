Bieri,   wooden mortuary figure of the Fang tribe of Gabon, Africa, that traditionally guarded the skulls of deceased ancestors. These figures were somewhat naturalistic, representing the ancestor whose skull was kept in a small, barrel-shaped bark container to which the figure was traditionally attached.
Because of the spiritual powers attributed to deceased ancestors, these mortuary figures were originally carved to protect the ancestor’s bones from possession by evil spirits and to shield the tribesmen from unwittingly coming into contact with the skull’s potentially dangerous powers. Through the aesthetic refinement of generations of sculptors, the bieri became figures of symbolic rather than spiritual significance.
