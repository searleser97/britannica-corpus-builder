Central African Workshop,   art workshop established in the late 1950s by Frank McEwen, the director of the Rhodesian Art Gallery in Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe), in order to encourage local African artists. McEwen first opened a studio for five painters, then a larger studio for many painters and sculptors. The workshop was successful and attractive to Africans because McEwen did not impose artistic theories on them or their works. Firmly believing that any formal teaching was inappropriate, he set instead an example of energy, enthusiasm, and criticism, teaching the artists to evaluate their own works and never to sell anything below standard.
The artists—formerly musicians, farmers, policemen, dancers, builders, and museum attendants—began as painters, but many later worked in stone. There was no living tradition of sculpture in the area, despite the 15th-century stone-carving tradition from the Zimbabwe temple. (Surviving artifacts are all in museums in London or Cape Town, where McEwen’s artists could not see them.) The contemporary stone art was so successful, however, that many pieces were sold to museums and private collectors. Forty-six works were displayed in 1968 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the best-known artists represented were Nicholas Mukomberanwa, Lemon Moses, Anderson McHewa, Bernard Matemera, and Joseph Ndandarika. Other exhibits were held in London (1964), Paris (1971), and elsewhere. Because the Rhodesian political atmosphere was not encouraging to the art workshop or its foreign patrons, McEwen finally resigned in 1967.
