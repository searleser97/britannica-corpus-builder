Aleijadinho, byname of Antônio Francisco Lisboa,  (born August 9, 1738?, Villa Rica [now Ouro Prêto], Brazil—died November 18, 1814, Mariana), prolific and influential Brazilian sculptor and architect whose Rococo statuary and religious articles complement the dramatic sobriety of his churches.
Aleijadinho, the son of the Portuguese architect Manoel Francisco Lisboa and an African woman, was born with a degenerative disease that led to the deformation of his limbs (his sobriquet means “Little Cripple”). He eventually lost the use of his hands, but he continued working with tools strapped to his arms throughout the rest of his career. Aleijadinho’s first major work, the Church of São Francisco de Assis, Ouro Prêto (1766–94), features dramatic round bell towers whose lines offset the more common straight lines of Portuguese tradition. He also designed, built, and decorated the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos, Congonhas (begun 1757), which is perhaps his most famous work. On the zigzag path to the church, Aleijadinho made several small structures for which he executed 64 wooden sculptures in seven groupings that represent episodes in the Passion of Christ. Large, exquisitely detailed sculptures of the Twelve Prophets, carved in soapstone, line the parapets along the exterior staircase.
