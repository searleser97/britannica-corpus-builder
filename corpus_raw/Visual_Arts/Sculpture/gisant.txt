Gisant, (French: “reclining”)  in sepulchral sculpture, a recumbent effigy representing the person dying or in death. The typical gisant depicts the deceased in “eternal repose,” awaiting the resurrection in prayer or holding attributes of office and clothed in the formal attire of his  social class or office. A variant of the gisant, technically known as a transi (“passed” into physical death), depicts the deceased as nude and shrouded, revealed in the coffin with embalming scars in the abdomen (an approach used during the Renaissance for French kings) or in a state of advanced desiccation or decomposition (an approach popular in northern Europe during the Middle Ages). The transi variation often positioned the deceased below a priant, a portrait effigy of the deceased kneeling in prayer, as in life. A further variant that developed during the Renaissance depicts the deceased in a semi-reclining pose, leaning on an elbow, awaiting the resurrection as if meditating, reading, or conversing. In the Baroque era, this type took a dramatic turn, exemplified by François Girardon’s tomb of the Cardinal de Richelieu (begun 1675) in the church of the Sorbonne in Paris. It represents Richelieu dying in the arms of Piety, with Doctrine mourning at his feet.
