Juan Martínez Montañés, in full Juan de Martínez Montañés,  (born March 16, 1568, Alcalá la Real, Jaén, Spain—died June 18, 1649, Sevilla), Spanish sculptor who was instrumental in the transition from Mannerism to the Baroque. His work influenced not only the sculptors and altarmakers of Spain and Latin America but also the Spanish painters of his century.
After studying in Granada under Pablo de Rojas (1579–82), Montañés went to Sevilla (Seville) in 1587 and established a studio that lasted until his death. He became known as the “Dios de la Madera” (“God of Wood Carving”) and had 50 years of enormous output and influence. He is remembered for his wood altars and altar figures covered with polished gold and paint in various colours. They are marked by an admirable aristocratic dignity, realistic yet idealized. He set the style throughout Spain and Latin America with such works as the statues of Christ on the cross, looking at the beholder; of the child Christ; and of the Immaculate Conception (all at the Sevilla Cathedral). The church in Santiponce, near Sevilla, contains his finest altar (1610–13); his largest work is at San Miguel in Jérez de la Frontera (1617–45).
