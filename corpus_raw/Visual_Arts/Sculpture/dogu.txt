Dogū,  abstract clay figurines, generally of pregnant females, made in Japan during the Jōmon period (c. 10,500 to c. 300 bce). Dogū are reminiscent of the rigidly frontal fertility figures produced by other prehistoric cultures.
Their precise function is unknown, but archaeological evidence suggests they were aids in childbirth as well as fertility symbols. They are also found in simulated burials, indicating some kind of ceremonial function. Fired at a low temperature, they often have crumbly surfaces; many are painted in red.
