Sir Edwin Landseer, in full Sir Edwin Henry Landseer,  (born March 7, 1802, London, Eng.—died  Oct. 1, 1873, London), British painter and sculptor best known for his paintings of animals.
Landseer learned drawing from his father, an engraver and writer, and also studied at the Royal Academy. His paintings of animals were based on sound anatomical knowledge and, at first, were marked by healthy animation. His later works were marred, however, by anthropomorphism that lapsed into sentimentality. His “Shoeing” (1844) and “Rout of Comus” (1843) exhibit his best style. The four bronze lions at the base of Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square, London (unveiled 1867), are his. He was elected to the Royal Academy (1831) and knighted (1850).
