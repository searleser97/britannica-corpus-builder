Bewcastle Cross,   runic monument in Cumbria, Eng., dating from the late 7th or early 8th century. Although the top of the cross has been lost, a weather-beaten, 15-foot (4.5-metre) shaft remains, showing on one face a figure of Christ trampling on the heads of beasts, a runic inscription underneath, and, above Christâ€™s figure, a falconer, possibly St. John the Evangelist with his eagle. On another side elaborate carvings depict a tree, branches, roots, leaves, fruit, birds, and animals. The half-obliterated inscription suggests that the monument was a memorial to Alchfrith, son of Oswiu of Northumbria, and his wife Cyneburh (Cyniburug). The sophistication, artistry, and spirit of the cross link it to the same period and school as the Ruthwell Cross.
