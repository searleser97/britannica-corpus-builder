Nicolas Schöffer,  (born September 6, 1912, Kalocsa, Austria-Hungary [now in Hungary]—died January 8, 1992, Paris, France), Hungarian-born French artist best known for his sculptures employing mechanical movement, light, and sound.
Schöffer studied painting at the School of Fine Arts in Budapest from 1932 to 1935 and then at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He became a French citizen in 1948. Between 1941 and 1951 he held a variety of jobs, including those of foundry worker and hotel porter.
Schöffer’s early metal sculptures, from the mid-1940s, reflect the hard-edged, self-consciously “modern” influences of Constructivism and Neoplasticism. The later kinetic works, which are variously concerned with the viewer’s experience of space, light, and time, Schöffer christened “spatiodynamic,” “luminodynamic,” and “chronodynamic.” These works characteristically employ rotation devices, sound machines, and screens onto which continually changing patterns of colour and shadow are projected, as, for example, in the spatiodynamic tower at Liège (1961). His work was frequently used in conjunction with experimental theatre (e.g., Night of Poetry, 1956–57).
