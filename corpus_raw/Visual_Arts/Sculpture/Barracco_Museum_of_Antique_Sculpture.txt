Barracco Museum of Antique Sculpture, Italian Museo Barracco di Scultura Antica,  in Rome, museum devoted to ancient sculpture and comprising the collection formed by Giovanni Barracco (1829â€“1914). The collection was given to Rome in 1902. There are fine examples of Egyptian, Assyrian, and Phoenician art, including a bust from Roman Egypt of a priest wearing a diadem, formerly thought to be a portrait of Julius Caesar. Greek sculpture of the classical period is well-represented. Among the finest examples is a head of Marsyas, a replica of the head of the famous statue by Myron. A head of Apollo Kitharoidos, after Praxiteles, is the best extant replica of that work. In addition there are excellent and valuable examples of Hellenistic sculpture and fine Roman portrait busts.
