Butades Of Sicyon,  also called Dibutades,  (flourished c. 600 bc?), ancient Greek clayman, who, according to the Roman writer Pliny the Elder, was the first modeler in clay. The story is that his daughter, smitten with love for a youth at Corinth, where they lived, drew upon the wall the outline of his shadow and that upon this outline her father modeled a face of the youth in clay and baked the model along with the clay tiles which it was his trade to make. (This model was reportedly preserved in Corinth until Mummius sacked that town in 146 bc.) This incident led Butades to ornament the ends of rooftiles with human faces. He is also said to have invented a mixture of clay and ruddle or to have introduced the use of a special kind of red clay.
