Caius Gabriel Cibber, Cibber also spelled Cibert,  (born 1630, Flensburg, Den.—died  1700, London), Danish-born English sculptor known for his Baroque architectural and garden sculpture. He was the father of the English actor, dramatist, and poet laureate Colley Cibber.
The son of the Danish king’s cabinetmaker, Cibber was sent to Italy at royal expense to study art. Before 1660 he was in England, working as foreman to John Stone (1620–67). Among his works are the famous statues of Raving Madness and Melancholy Madness (1670s) for the gate of Bedlam hospital (now in the Bethlem Royal Hospital Museum) and a tomb (1677) at Withyham, Sussex, for the Sackville family, considered one of the finest examples of English sculpture in the 17th century.
Between 1688 and 1691 he was working at Chatsworth, Derbyshire, where he made figures for the house, chapel, and garden. He was employed by Sir Christopher Wren to carve the pediment on the eastern park front of Hampton Court and executed some of the architectural detail at St. Paul’s Cathedral. He died before his work on the latter was completed. His work shows the influence of Dutch and Roman Baroque sculpture and is often cited as being competent but provincial.
