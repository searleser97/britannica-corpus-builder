Marisol, in full Marisol Escobar,  (born May 22, 1930, Paris, France—died April 30, 2016, New York, New York, U.S.), American sculptor of boxlike figurative works combining wood and other materials and often grouped as tableaux. She rose to fame during the 1960s and all but disappeared from art history until the 21st century.
Marisol was born in Paris of Venezuelan parents and spent her youth in Los Angeles and Paris, studying briefly at the École des Beaux-Arts (1949). In 1950 she moved to New York City, where she studied at the Art Students League and the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts. From her earliest, roughly carved figures, she worked mainly in wood.
In New York she made ties with the Abstract Expressionists—Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, and Jackson Pollock, among them. Though she is often associated with Pop art, she incorporated many influences into her work (folk art, pre-Columbian art, Cubism, Dadaism, collage) and thus defies classification. She gained wide recognition in the 1960s for her mixed-media figure groups; the juxtaposition of blockish inert forms and their painted, cast-plaster, or found-object features and accoutrements lend the works a deadpan irony. Many of her works depict variations of the family unit. Her portrait groups of public figures such as Charles de Gaulle and Lyndon B. Johnson (both 1967) are particularly satirical. In 1961 she was included in the Museum of Modern Art exhibition “The Art of Assemblage.” The next year and then again in 1964 she had wildly successful solo exhibitions at the Stable Gallery in New York City. During the 1960s and ’70s, Marisol was firmly situated within Andy Warhol’s social and artistic orbit; she became a close friend of his and earned roles in his films Kiss (1963) and 13 Most Beautiful Women (1964).
In the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s she continued to make portrait sculptures of artists (Georgia O’Keeffe with Dogs, 1977, and Portrait of Marcel Duchamp, 1981) and political figures (Bishop Desmond Tutu, 1988). She also began to address historical events, as in Blackfoot Delegation to Washington 1916 (1993), which makes reference to the Native American Blackfoot tribe’s attempt to negotiate with the United States government for land rights.
In 2014–15 a retrospective and scholarly catalog of Marisol’s sculptures and works on paper (organized by the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Memphis, Tennessee; traveled to the El Museo del Barrio in New York City) helped to reintroduce her and reestablish her name in the history of art.
