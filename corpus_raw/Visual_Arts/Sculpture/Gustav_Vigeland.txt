Gustav Vigeland, in full Adolf Gustav Vigeland,  (born April 11, 1869, Mandal, Norway—died March 12, 1943, Oslo), Norwegian sculptor who was best known for creating an outdoor sculpture complex in Frogner Park, Oslo.
Vigeland, whose father was a carpenter, was apprenticed to a wood-carver in 1884. He attended art schools in Oslo and Copenhagen and then spent several months in Paris in 1893. While there, he visited the studio of Auguste Rodin; that sculptor’s influence can be seen in the highly realistic, emotional style of Vigeland’s early work.
Vigeland’s first sculptures were mostly naturalistic portrait busts and reliefs. About 1900 he was influenced by medieval sculpture; consequently, he adopted a more simple and stylized approach. He soon embarked upon the project that would occupy him for the rest of his career: a large series of monumental figures for a park in Oslo. Vigeland designed more than 200 individual sculptural projects for Frogner Park, including an entrance, bridge, fountain, circular staircase, mosaic labyrinth, and a stone forest composed of carved figures. A central monolith, carved from a single column of solid granite 57 feet (17 m) high, consists of 121 figures and is surrounded by 36 major groupings, all dealing with the various periods in the cycle of life—birth, childhood, adolescence, maturity, old age, and death.
