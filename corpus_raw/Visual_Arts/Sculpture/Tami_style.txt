Tami style,  type of Oceanic carving originating on the Tami Islands, in Papua New Guinea. The style spread to the coastal areas along the Huon Gulf, to the islands of Umboi and Siassi, and to western New Britain.
In representations of the human figure, the Tami style creates an impression of massiveness. The images, full-length and standing, are dominated by rectilinear lines, the head set directly on the torso and the arms and legs hanging straight down, though slightly bent. Three distinct horizontal axes cut across the statue—at the shoulder, at the hips, and at the feet. The monumental head supports a decorative headdress. The face is triangular with closely set, circular eyes placed directly under the lower edge of the forehead, which is connected to a thin, perpendicular nose. Unique to the sculpture of the Huon Gulf are triangular shapes painted or incised at the lateral extremities of the face with the apexes pointing toward the centre. The Tami style as manifested in figural sculpture has been extremely important in the art of Oceania; it has been suggested that few, if any, representations of the human figure have escaped its influence.
Decoration in the Tami style is also seen on ceremonial masks, in which articulation of the facial features closely resembles the style of carving found on the cult figures. The Tami style, as it is seen on secular objects, is characterized by depiction of a wide variety of animal figures (crocodile, turtle, lizard, fish, pig) in a highly stylized manner. The animal forms—commonly found on wooden bowls, suspension hooks, lime spatulas, headrests, canoe prows, and paddles—occasionally appear with representations of human beings.
