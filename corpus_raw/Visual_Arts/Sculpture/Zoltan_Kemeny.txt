Zoltan Kemeny,  (born March 21, 1907, Bănița, Austria-Hungary [now in Romania]—died June 14, 1965, Zürich, Switzerland), Hungarian-born Swiss sculptor of dramatic metal reliefs.
Kemeny was trained in cabinetmaking and architecture, and he worked for a time in fashion design. He lived in Paris from 1930 to 1940 before permanently settling in Zürich in 1942. The painter Jean Dubuffet’s use of unorthodox materials such as sand and gravel inspired Kemeny to begin working in relief in 1946. In his early reliefs, the coarseness of the materials (often scrap metal, wire, nails, and springs) contrasts sharply with his fluent sculptural style; images seem to grow and float on the surfaces. Kemeny made his first metal reliefs in the mid-1950s. After experimenting with lead, zinc, tin, iron, and aluminum, he settled upon copper and brass as his favourite materials. He would structure each relief around a single constituent shape, which he then repeated throughout the work in many different sizes and variations. Will Energy Tension Creation (1958) is a major work, as is Metallo-Magic (1963). Kemeny received numerous commissions for large public works, such as a 360-foot- (110-metre-) long brass panel suspended in the foyer of the Frankfurt Municipal Theatre in Germany.
Kemeny’s reputation grew after World War II, and he had numerous solo exhibitions in major European cities. He was awarded first prize in sculpture at the Venice Biennale in 1964, and a retrospective of his work was held in Paris in 1966 at the National Museum of Modern Art.
