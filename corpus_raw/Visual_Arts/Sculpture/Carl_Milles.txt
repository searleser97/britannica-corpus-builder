Carl Milles, original name Wilhelm Carl Emil Andersson,  (born June 23, 1875, Lagga, near Uppsala, Sweden—died September 19, 1955, Lidingö), Swedish sculptor known for his expressive and rhythmical large-scale fountains.
Milles studied and worked in Paris from 1897 to 1904. He won public recognition in 1902 through the competition for a monument honouring the Swedish regent Sten Sture at Uppsala (completed 1925). In his early work Milles was influenced by the French Romantic sculptor Auguste Rodin. From 1904 to 1906 he lived in Munich, Germany, where he encountered medieval and early Greek art as interpreted by the German sculptor-theorist Adolf von Hildebrand.
Milles worked in clay (for casting into bronze) and in stone and wood. His best-known works are monumental fountains that combine elements of spacious design, subtle water effects, and inventive figure types (such as the fusion of classical triton or faun with Nordic goblin or troll). He created his first major fountain, Europa (1926), for the city of Halmstad, Sweden. His other notable fountains include Orpheus Fountain in Stockholm (1936) and Meeting of the Waters in St. Louis, Missouri (1940).
In 1931 Milles became head of the sculpture department at Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and in 1945 he became a U.S. citizen. Milles’s works were collected at Cranbrook, his home for 20 years, and at the Milles villa, now a museum, in Lidingö, near Stockholm. His Fountain of the Muses, or Aganippe Fountain (completed 1955), was installed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City shortly after his death; it was moved to Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina in 1982.
