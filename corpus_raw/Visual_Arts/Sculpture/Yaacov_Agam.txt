Yaacov Agam, original name Jacob Gipstein,  (born May 11, 1928, Rishon le-Zion, Palestine [now Rishon LeẔiyyon, Israel]), pioneer and leading exponent of optical and kinetic art, best known for his three-dimensional paintings and sculptures.
Agam was the son of a Russian rabbi. He grew up in an early Jewish settlement and did not begin his formal schooling until age 13. Having learned to draw at an early age, he studied art in Jerusalem (1947–48), Zürich (1949–51), and Paris (1951) and had his first one-man exhibition, “Peintures en Mouvement” (“Paintings in Movement”), in 1953 in Paris, where he settled. Eventually, his body of work grew to include vibrating and tactile elements, and he began to create manipulable sculptures as well.
Agam’s relief paintings, with their shifting, merging geometric forms, demonstrate his concern with time, movement, and viewer involvement. The viewer becomes a participant in the transformation—in a sense, the creation—of Agam’s works by moving in front of them, by rotating the works, or by manipulating various elements of the works. Examples of Agam’s works include Three Times Three Interplay (1970–71) and The Thousand Gates (1972) in the gardens of Israel’s presidential palace in Jerusalem. He also designed an enormous musical fountain situated in the Quartier de la Défense, Paris (1975), and the world’s largest menorah (32 feet [9.75 metres]) in Manhattan, New York (1977). The work was inspired by the original menorah in the Holy Temple of Jerusalem.
Agam frequently exhibited his work with other kinetic artists and in solo shows, including those at the Musée National d’Art Moderne, Paris (1972); Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (1973); Jewish Museum, New York (1975); Guggenheim Museum, New York (1980); and Isetan Museum, Tokyo (1989). Just before celebrating his 90th birthday, Agam opened the Yaacov Agam Museum of Art (2018), an institution in his hometown dedicated to his work.
