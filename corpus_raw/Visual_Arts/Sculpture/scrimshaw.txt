Scrimshaw,   the decoration of bone or ivory objects, such as whale’s teeth or walrus tusks, with fanciful designs. The designs, executed by whale fishermen of American and Anglo-American origin, were carved with either a jackknife or a sail needle and then emphasized with black pigments, commonly lampblack. Among the subjects are whaling scenes, whaling ships, naval action, frigates, brigs, sailors’ sweethearts, bouquets of flowers, Masonic emblems, coats of arms, and the Irish harp. Examples date from the late 17th century, but the craft reached its peak during the years 1830–50. Scrimshaw is still practiced by whalers such as the Chukchi of Siberia and the Eskimos of Siberia and Alaska.
