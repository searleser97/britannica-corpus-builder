Armature,   in sculpture, a skeleton or framework used by an artist to support a figure being modeled in soft plastic material. An armature can be made from any material that is damp-resistant and rigid enough to hold such plastic materials as moist clay and plaster, which are applied to and shaped around it. Pieces of thick wire, a few blocks of wood nailed together, or a galvanized iron pipe secured to a baseboard can serve as the armature for a life-sized head or a small standing figure. Larger pieces of sculpture are supported by more complicated armatures constructed of lead pipe, iron rods, or pipes and wood. A combination of these materials is used in the huge armatures required for monumental sculpture. Armatures for large models were used as early as the Renaissance.
