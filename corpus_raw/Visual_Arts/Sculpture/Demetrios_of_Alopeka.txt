Demetrios of Alopeka, also spelled Demetrius of Alopece,  (flourished c. 350–c. 400 bce), Greek sculptor, said by ancient critics to have been notable for the lifelike realism of his statues. His style was contrasted with that of Cresilas, an idealizing sculptor of the generation before. Demetrios mainly produced portrait statues, and his portrait of Pellichus, a Corinthian general, was admired by Lucian. A few extant works have been attributed to Demetrios—most notably the head of Lysimache (a priestess of Athena), now in the British Museum—but none has been authenticated. A statue base, found at the Acropolis at Athens, however, bears the inscription that he was the sculptor of such a statue.
