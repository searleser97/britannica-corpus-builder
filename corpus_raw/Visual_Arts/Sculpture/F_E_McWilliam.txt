F.E. McWilliam, in full Frederick Edward McWilliam,  (born April 30, 1909, Banbridge, County Down, Northern Ireland—died May 13, 1992, London, England), Irish sculptor who worked in wood, stone, and bronze to create Surrealist abstract and semiabstract sculptures.
McWilliam studied painting and drawing at the Belfast College of Art in Northern Ireland (1928) and at the Slade School of Fine Art in London (1928–31) before moving to Paris. He soon returned to England and began to sculpt. His first sculptures, which he carved using the local Buckinghamshire cherry wood, were biomorphic forms influenced by African sculpture and the abstract work of Jean Arp and Constantin Brancusi. In 1936 McWilliam visited the International Surrealist Exhibition in London, and he consequently adopted the Surrealists’ strategy of illogically juxtaposing elements to achieve a dramatic effect. This can be seen in sculptures such as Profile (1940), in which McWilliam represented a human head as a whimsical assemblage of isolated features.
After serving in the Royal Air Force in India during World War II, McWilliam taught drawing and sculpture in Bengal (1944–46) and in London at the Chelsea School of Art (1946–47) and at the Slade (1947–66). His work was seldom overtly political, but in 1972–73 he made a series of powerful bronzes, Women of Belfast, in response to the bombing of the Abercorn restaurant in Belfast. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1959 and was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966. McWilliam was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London in 1989.
