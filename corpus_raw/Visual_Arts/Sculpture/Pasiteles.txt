Pasiteles,   (flourished  1st century bc), Greek sculptor notable for having written a book, in five volumes, about works of art throughout the world. None of Pasiteles’ own sculpture has survived.
Little is known about Pasiteles. He was born in a Greek city in southern Italy and became a Roman citizen in 90/89. He made an ivory and gold statue of Zeus for the temple of Metellus. It is believed that he was one of the originators of the methods of exact copying of statuary by means of plaster casts and the pointing machine, without which the thousands of copies from original Greek statues that were disseminated throughout Greco-Roman civilization could never have been produced. He also worked from nature, however, as is shown in Pliny’s story that while sketching a lion he was almost killed by a panther.
