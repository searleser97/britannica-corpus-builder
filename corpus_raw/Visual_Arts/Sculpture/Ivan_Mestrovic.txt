Ivan Meštrović,  (born August 15, 1883, Vrpolje, Slavonia, Austria-Hungary [now in Croatia]—died January 16, 1962, South Bend, Indiana, U.S.), Croatian-born American sculptor known for his boldly cut figurative monuments and reliefs.
The son of Croatian peasants, Meštrović was apprenticed to a marble cutter at age 13, and three years later he entered the Vienna Academy, where he studied until 1904. He exhibited at the Vienna Sezession exhibitions and at the Austrian exhibition at Earl’s Court in London in 1906. In 1908–09 Meštrović lived in Paris, where he attracted the notice of the renowned French sculptor Auguste Rodin. Meštrović promoted a Croatian artistic movement, and he portrayed characters from local legend in early work such as The Kosovo Cycle (1908–10). After World War I he was appointed rector of the Academy of Art in Zagreb, Croatia.
Meštrović turned to biblical themes in his later works, which include many monumental figures as well as reliefs such as The Deposition (1917). His figures are often elongated, with angular, simplified features. He usually carved in marble and wood and cast his sculptures in plaster and bronze. Meštrović moved to the United States in January 1947 and later that year had a solo exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He taught sculpture at Syracuse University in New York, beginning in 1947, and he became a U.S. citizen in 1954. The following year he became a professor of fine arts at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. An architect as well as a sculptor, Meštrović designed his own house at Split, Yugoslavia (now in Croatia); it is now used as a museum for his work.
