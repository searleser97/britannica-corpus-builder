Sukhothai style,  one of the canonical styles for Buddha icons developed probably in the Tai kingdom of Sukhothai (modern Thailand), beginning in the 14th century. As the first of at least three major successive efforts by Tai kings to establish an “authentic” canon for the icons, the Sukhothai style was followed by the U Thong and the lion types.
The most direct influence on Sukhothai style was the art of Sri Lanka (Ceylon), which was a stronghold of Theravada Buddhism and a source of images worthy of copying. Buddhism had long since declined in India.
The Sukhothai Buddha is composed of sinuous curves and cylindrical forms, creating a boneless, weightless elegance. The various portions of the body follow abstract ideals based on analogy with natural forms, such as shoulders like an elephant’s trunk, a torso like a lion, and a nose like a parrot’s beak. The face and features are elongated, and the brows, eyes, nose, and mouth are a series of strongly marked curves. The head typically bears a flamelike protuberance above a cranial bump, which is believed by the faithful to contain an extra brain cavity. The Buddhas are typically either seated in the half-lotus posture with right hand performing the earth-touching gesture or walking with one foot forward and the right hand raised to the chest. The so-called walking Buddha is a Tai creation and did not exist in India as a canonical type.
The Sukhothai image remained the most popular in Thailand and was a chief influence on the later U Thong style.
