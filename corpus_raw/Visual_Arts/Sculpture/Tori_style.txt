Tori style,  in Japanese art, style of sculpture that emerged during the Asuka period (552–645 ce) and lasted into the Nara period (710–784). It was derived from the Chinese Northern Wei style (386–534/535 ce). It is called Tori style after the sculptor Kuratsukuri Tori, who was of Chinese descent. That sculptor’s best-known piece is a Buddhist triad, which was made in 623 ce as a memorial to Prince Shōtoku. It represents the Shaka Buddha (the Japanese name for Shakyamuni)  seated on a throne and flanked on either side by bodhisattvas, with a great mandorla behind.
Works in true Tori style are remarkably similar to Northern Wei sculpture found at the Longmen caves in China. Characteristics include slender, elegant bodies, a strong, linear interest in drapery, and a tendency toward squatness in the proportion of the faces and also in the relationship of the body to the feet. Facial features include almond-shaped eyes and an archaic smile.
