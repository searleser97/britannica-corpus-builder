Jean-Paul Riopelle,  (born Oct. 7, 1923, Montreal, Que., Can.—died March 12, 2002, Ile-aux-Grues, near Quebec City), Canadian painter and sculptor who was widely regarded as Canada’s most important modern artist. His work, much of which was done in the Abstract Expressionist style, was often compared to that of American artist Jackson Pollock.
After studying painting at the École des Beaux-Arts and École du Meuble in Montreal from 1943 to 1945, Riopelle moved to Paris in 1947. There he associated with Surrealists such as André Breton and Marcel Duchamp and, with Paul-Émile Borduas, became associated with the group of Canadian painters known as Les Automatistes, who practiced automatism. There too he first gained international recognition.  His early lyrical, abstract paintings evolved into a denser, more powerful impasto style. He is renowned for his use of various media (including watercolour, ink, oils, crayon, and chalk), and he also produced large collage murals. He represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1954 and achieved international acclaim with the huge triptych Pavane (1954).
Riopelle’s work was again chosen for the Venice Biennale in 1962 and was awarded the UNESCO prize that year. In 1963 the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, exhibited 82 of his paintings and sculptures; at age 40 Riopelle became the youngest artist to be given a retrospective exhibition at the gallery. He spent most of his time in Paris but returned to Canada in the early 1990s, settling permanently in Quebec. He remained a prolific artist in the last decade of his life, and his work became more representational, with the suggestion of landscape marked in many of his paintings. In 2000 he produced his last major work, L’Hommage à Rosa Luxemburg, a narrative fresco of 30 paintings that was more than 40 metres (130 feet) long.
