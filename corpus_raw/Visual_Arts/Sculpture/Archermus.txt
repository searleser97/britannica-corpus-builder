Archermus,   (flourished  6th century bc), ancient Greek sculptor from the island of Chios who was known for his treatment of draped female figures. Associated with his father, Micciades, and his sons Bupalus and Athenis, Archermus executed his works in native marble and is said to have been the first sculptor to represent Victory and Love as winged. A statue base discovered on the island of Delos, signed by Archermus and his father, was at first associated with a winged female figure found nearby and attributed to Archermus, but the base is now believed to have supported a sphinx.
