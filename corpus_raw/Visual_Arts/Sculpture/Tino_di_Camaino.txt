Tino Di Camaino,   (born 1280/85, Siena, republic of Siena [Italy]—died  1337, Naples), Sienese sculptor significant for his numerous sepulchral monuments.
Tino was a follower, and possibly a pupil, of Giovanni Pisano. In 1315 he became capomaestro of the Cathedral of Pisa and was commissioned to make a tomb for the Holy Roman emperor Henry VII. He succeeded his father as the capomaestro of the Siena cathedral in 1320 and designed the tomb of Cardinal Petroni (1318), which has components of Gothic architectural structure.
Tino executed tombs in Pisa, Florence, Naples, and Siena, though he remained in Naples after 1323. His tomb of Gastone della Torre and that of Antonio degli Orso, bishop of Florence, are two major works completed in Florence between 1321 and 1323. The figures on Tino’s decorative, multilayered wall tombs are characterized by a rounding of forms and simplified anatomical detail. He expanded upon the ideas of Arnolfo di Cambio and Pisano.
