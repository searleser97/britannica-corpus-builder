Buli style, also called long-faced style of Buli,  African wood sculpture made by the Luba peoples (Baluba) of Congo (Kinshasa). Because the carvings—which were made in the village of Buli (now in Katanga province)—are almost identical to each other and differ from other Luba carvings, they were originally presumed to have been the work of a single artist, called the Master of Buli. Later, it was determined that the sculptures constitute the production of a workshop rather than of one artist.
The Buli style is highly distinctive. The most representative examples are stools; the seats are supported on the heads and fingertips of figures, the fingers being separated with the palms forward. The elongated face of each figure has a pointed chin; a wide, rather thin-lipped mouth; a narrow nose with sharply defined nostrils; and a high, rounded forehead with prominent arches over the half-closed eyes that have protruding cheekbones below them. The hair is swept backward to an elaborate cruciform design. The limbs are thin compared with most Luba sculpture, but the hands and feet are broad and schematized. The breasts on both female and male figures are thin and pointed, those on the male being flatter than those on the female.
