Mbulu-ngulu,   tomb figure of carved wood covered with a sheet of copper or brass, created by the Kota tribe of Gabon, Africa, to protect the dead. Its traditional function, as a guardian figure standing against a wall, had a direct influence upon its form.
Carved in a highly stylized fashion, the figures consist of an abstracted fan-shaped head bisected vertically and horizontally by metal bands placed on top of a pounded metal sheet covering the head. The head is placed on a copper-covered, cylindrical neck, resting on schematically represented bent arms supported by a short base. The mbulu-ngulu figures, which exhibit a serene, curious sense of detachment, are among the most stylized of all African figures.
