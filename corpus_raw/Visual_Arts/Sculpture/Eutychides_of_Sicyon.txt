Eutychides of Sicyon,  (flourished c. 300â€“c. 250 bce), Greek sculptor, who was a pupil of Lysippus. His most-noted work was a statue of Fortune, which he made for the city of Antioch (founded 300 bce). The goddess, who embodies the idea of the city, was represented seated on a rock, with the Orontes River at her feet. The composition was later repeated on Syrian coins of Tigranes II the Great (83 bce) and has been identified in several extant statues.
