Pythagoras,  (flourished 5th century bce), noted Greek sculptor of Rhegium (present-day Reggio di Calabria, Italy), a contemporary of Myron and Polyclitus and their rival in making statues of athletes. One of those, that of the boxer Euthymus of Locri, was erected after the latterâ€™s third victory at Olympia in 472 bce.
Pythagoras migrated in his youth to Rhegium. He made a statue of Philoctetes, noted for the physical expression of pain; an Apollo shooting the Python at Delphi; and a man singing to the lyre. His technical improvements went far in ending Archaic stiffness in Greek sculpture. No existing work can be certainly attributed to him, and, although his influence must have been widespread, attempts to identify copies of his works remain conjectural.
