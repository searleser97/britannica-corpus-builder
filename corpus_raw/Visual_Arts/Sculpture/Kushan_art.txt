Kushan art, also spelled Kusana,  art produced during the Kushan dynasty from about the late 1st to the 3rd century ce in an area that now includes parts of Central Asia, northern India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.
The Kushans fostered a mixed culture that is best illustrated by the variety of deities—Greco-Roman, Iranian, and Indian—invoked on their coins. At least two major stylistic divisions can be made among artifacts of the period: imperial art of Iranian derivation and Buddhist art of mixed Greco-Roman and Indian sources. The best examples of the former are gold coins issued by the seven Kushan kings, the Kushan royal portraits (e.g., the Kanishka statue), and princely portraits found at Surkh-Kotal in Afghanistan. The style of Kushan artworks is stiff, hieratic, and frontal. Anatomy and drapery are stylized in the early period, and they are in stark contrast to the second style, which is typified by the Gandhara and Mathura schools of Kushan art.
