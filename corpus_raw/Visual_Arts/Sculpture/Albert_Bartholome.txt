Albert Bartholomé, in full Paul-Albert Bartholomé,  (born Aug. 29, 1848, Thiverval, France—died  Oct. 31?, 1928, Paris), sculptor whose works, particularly his funerary art, made him one of the best known of modern French sculptors.
Bartholomé began his career as a painter, studying briefly at the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Wanting to prepare a monument to his dead wife, he turned to sculpture in 1886. Though he had no formal training, he made a careful study of nature and of the masterpieces of the past. His reputation was established with Monument to the Dead (1895) in the Père-Lachaise Cemetery, Paris, a piece of architectural sculpture on a grand scale. Composed as a two-story wall monument with a procession of people entering the “door of death” over a niche where a nude young family clings to one another in death, it is human and secular, emphasizing the human bond in death as in life. This success led to commissions for a number of funerary monuments. His work had a conceptual depth and dignity that has close affinities with Symbolism.
