Adolfo Pérez Esquivel,  (born November 26, 1931, Buenos Aires, Argentina), Argentine sculptor and architect, who became a champion of human rights and nonviolent reform in Latin America. His work as secretary-general of Peace and Justice (Paz y Justicia), an ecumenical organization established in 1974 to coordinate human rights activities throughout Latin America, brought him the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1980.
Pérez Esquivel, son of a fisherman, was already well-known as a sculptor when he was appointed to a professorship at the Argentine National School of Fine Arts in 1968. He resigned his chair upon being chosen to lead Peace and Justice in 1974. His outspoken advocacy placed him in a precarious situation: in denouncing the terrorism of both the left and the right that had brought Argentina to the brink of civil war, he brought upon himself the enmity of both sides. He spoke on behalf of the desaparecidos, the thousands of people who had simply “disappeared” during the Argentine military junta’s campaign against extremists. He was himself arrested in 1977 and held without charge for 14 months, during which time he was tortured.
In the years following his receipt of the Nobel Prize, Pérez Esquivel lectured and traveled extensively. He continued to be an outspoken advocate of human rights into the 21st century.
