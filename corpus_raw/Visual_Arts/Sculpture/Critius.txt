Critius and Nesiotes,  (flourished late 5th century bc, Athens),  Greek sculptors known for their bronze figures of the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogiton, copies of the original bronzes executed by Antenor about 510 bc, which were taken by Xerxes I to Susa and subsequently lost. The copies were placed in the agora in Athens; the figure of the tyrannicides has been identified on Roman coins, vases, reliefs, and fragments. One of the finest copies is that in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale in Naples; a reconstructed statue of Aristogiton is in the Museo dei Conservatori in Rome.
