Camille Claudel, in full Camille-Rosalie Claudel,  (born December 8, 1864, Villeneuve-sur-Fère, France—died October 19, 1943, Montdevergues asylum, Montfavet, near Avignon), French sculptor of whose work little remains and who for many years was best known as the mistress and muse of Auguste Rodin. She was also the sister of Paul Claudel, whose journals and memoirs provide much of the scant information available on his sister’s life.
Between the ages of about 5 and 12, Camille Claudel was taught by the Sisters of Christian Doctrine. When the family moved to Nogent-sur-Seine, the education of the Claudel children was continued by a tutor. Camille had little formal education from that point on, but she read widely in her father’s well-stocked library. By her teenage years she was already a remarkably gifted sculptor, and her abilities were recognized by other artists of the time. When in 1881 her father was once again transferred, he moved his family to Paris. There Camille entered the Colarossi Academy (now the Grande Chaumière) and met a lifelong friend, Jessie Lipscomb (later Elborne). Her first extant works are from that period.
Claudel and Rodin probably first met in 1883. Shortly thereafter she became his student, collaborator, model, and mistress. While continuing to work on her own pieces, she is believed to have contributed, as a typical studio assistant or student would have, whole figures and parts of figures to Rodin’s projects of that period, particularly to The Gates of Hell. She continued to live at home until 1888, when she moved to her own quarters near Rodin’s studio at La Folie Neubourg. By 1892 her relationship with Rodin had begun to crumble, and by 1893 she was both living and working alone, though she continued to communicate with him until 1898. From that point on she worked ceaselessly, impoverished and increasingly reclusive. She continued to exhibit at recognized salons (the Salon d’Automne, the Salon des Indépendants) and at the Bing and Eugène Blot galleries, though just as often she would utterly destroy every piece of work in her studio. She became obsessed with Rodin’s injustice to her and began to feel persecuted by him and his “gang.” Alienated from most human society, living at a great distance from Paul—the one family member close to her—she finally was overwhelmed by her condition. On March 10, 1913, she was committed involuntarily to an asylum at Ville-Évrard. In September 1914 she was transferred to the asylum of Montdevergues, where she remained until her death.
