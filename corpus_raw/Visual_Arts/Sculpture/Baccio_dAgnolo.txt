Baccio d’Agnolo, byname of Bartolomeo d’Agnolo Baglioni,  (born May 15, 1462—died  March 6, 1543, Florence [Italy]), wood-carver, sculptor, and architect who exerted an important influence on the Renaissance architecture of Florence. Between 1491 and 1502 he did much of the decorative carving in the church of Santa Maria Novella and in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. He helped restore the Palazzo Vecchio and in 1506 was commissioned to complete the drum of the cupola of Santa Maria del Fiore; but, because of adverse criticism by Michelangelo, the work was not carried out. Baccio d’Agnolo also planned the Villa Borghese and the Bartolini palace and designed the campanile of Santo Spirito. His studio was frequented by Michelangelo, Jacopo da Sansovino, Raphael, and other notable artists of the day.
