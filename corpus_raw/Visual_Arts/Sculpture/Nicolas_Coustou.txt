Nicolas Coustou,  (born Jan. 9, 1658, Lyon, France—died  1733, Paris), French sculptor whose style was based upon the academic grand manner of the sculptors who decorated the Palace of Versailles, though with some of the freedom of the Rococo manner. He worked in a variety of mediums and produced many works, some in collaboration with his brother, Guillaume.
Coustou was trained by his father, François, and at the age of nineteen was sent to Paris to work in the studio of his uncle Antoine Coysevox. Coustou received a first prize in sculpture in 1682 with his bas-relief Cain Building the Town of Enoch and the next year went to Rome, where his works include Borghese Gladiator and a marble copy of a statue of the emperor Commodus in the guise of Hercules. In 1686 he returned to France and a year later settled in Paris. In 1688 he won a position at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture with an allegorical bas-relief in honour of Louis XIV; he was promoted to adjunct professor (1695), to professor (1702), to rector (1720), and, finally, to chancellor of the academy (1733).
During this period Coustou often received official commissions, which he sometimes carried out with his brother Guillaume. Some of Nicolas’ most notable works were a sculpture for the St. Ambrose chapel of the Church of the Invalides, Paris (1692); four groups of Prophets in the St. Jerome chapel, Paris (1692); and a figure entitled France for the cornice of the Chambre du Roi at Versailles (1701). Coustou also contributed a number of sculptured pieces for the park of the Château de Marly not far from Versailles, including Diane and Endymion (1701), Adonis Rests from the Chase (1710), The Nymphes, and Julius Caesar (1696–1713). In 1713 he was commissioned to execute a large statue of St. Denis for the transept of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, Paris. Coustou also provided a number of decorations for great houses in Paris and Lyons. Among his last works were a large marble bas-relief of the Passage of the Rhine (1715–18) and a commission completed in 1725 for the Descent from the Cross, in Notre-Dame, which completed a group collectively known as The Vow of Louis XIII. Coustou also executed a number of busts and funeral monuments.
