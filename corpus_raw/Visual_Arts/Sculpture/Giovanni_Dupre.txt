Giovanni Dupré,  (born March 1, 1817, Siena, Tuscany—died  Jan. 10, 1882, Florence), Italian sculptor whose success was due to his lifelike and original interpretation of form when Italian sculpture was deteriorating into a mannered imitation of the works of Antonio Canova.
Dupré was the son of a carver in wood. His first work of importance was a marble “Abel” (1842). The grand duchess Marie of Russia commissioned him to execute a statue of “Cain” (1844), and the grand duchess of Tuscany commissioned one of “Giotto” (1845). The mourning “Sappho” (1857) was his most notable work of this period. A visit in 1856 to Naples and Rome, where he admired Canova’s monument to Pius VI, influenced him toward Neoclassicism. His monuments, e.g., that of Cavour in Turin, suffer from the conflict between his temperamental naturalism and the necessities of allegory and ideal grandeur. Dupré also executed many portrait busts.
