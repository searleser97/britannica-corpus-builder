Moai figure,  small wooden statue of uncertain religious significance, carved on Easter Island. The figures, thought to be representations of ancestors who live on in the form of skeletons, are of two types, moai kavakava (male) and moai paepae (female). They were sometimes used for fertility rites but were more often used for harvest celebrations, during which the first picking of fruits was heaped around them as offerings. During the time between these public festivals, the statues were wrapped in bark cloth and kept in private homes, where it is possible that they served decorative or private ritualistic purposes. It has been reported, for example, that from time to time the islanders picked the figures up like dolls and executed slight dancing motions with them.
The moai kavakava were fashioned as slumping human figures that displayed the rib cage and spinal cord through decaying flesh. The head is of a standard type, in which circular eyes are placed under bushy, protruding eyebrows and often filled with shells. A large, blunted beak nose dominates the facial profile, and the downward-curving nostrils direct attention to the open mouth and bared teeth. A goatee always ornaments the chin of the moai kavakava, and a fantasy animal or human is sometimes incised on the crown of the head.
The moai paepae, which appear to have been executed at a later date, had a flat, relieflike quality resulting from a shallow demarcation of the breasts, torso, limbs, and genitals. The long face with huge, staring eyes gives the female figure a haunting expression that makes it an appropriate pendant to its male counterpart.
