Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, original name Henri Gaudier,  (born October 4, 1891, Saint Jean-de-Braye, France—died June 5, 1915, Neuville-Saint-Vaast), French artist who was one of the earliest abstract sculptors and an exponent of the Vorticist movement; he was instrumental in introducing modern art to England during the early years of the 20th century.
Gaudier-Brzeska initially studied business before taking up sculpture in 1910. His early work was informed by the figurative sculpture of Auguste Rodin. In 1910 he met Sophie Brzeska, and the couple combined their last names. Later that year they moved to London, where the poet Ezra Pound became the young sculptor’s patron and propagandist. The early carvings of Sir Jacob Epstein encouraged Gaudier to experiment with abstraction and to draw upon the art of non-Western cultures on view at the British Museum. Gaudier’s various influences are visible in his most famous work, Red Stone Dancer (1913), a figure composed of simplified geometric forms that also retains some of the emotionalism of Rodin. Just before World War I, Gaudier-Brzeska joined Wyndham Lewis’s Vorticist movement, which advocated abstraction and an embrace of the machines and energy of modern life. The clean lines and smooth surfaces of Gaudier-Brzeska’s carvings were considered to embody this energy.
Gaudier-Brzeska’s promising career was cut short when he was killed in combat in World War I. After his death, he was remembered as a tragic example of unfulfilled genius.
