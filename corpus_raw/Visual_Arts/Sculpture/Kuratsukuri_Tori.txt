Kuratsukuri Tori, also known as Kuratsukuri no Tori (“Tori the Saddler”) or Tori Busshi (“Buddhist sculptor Tori”),  (flourished  7th century, Japan), the first great Japanese sculptor of the Asuka period (552–645).
Tori belonged to the hereditary kuratsukuri-be (“saddlemakers’ guild”), and, as an ardent Buddhist, he applied his technique of making gilt bronze ornaments for saddle trappings to the making of bronze Buddhas. Empress Suiko and Crown Prince Shōtoku, the great patron of Japanese Buddhism, commissioned Tori to do numerous works, including a bronze Daibutsu (“Great Buddha,” a large statue of a buddha) depicting Shaka Nyorai (the historical Buddha), completed in 606 for the Asuka Temple, near modern Nara; and Shaka Sanzonzō (“Shaka Triad”), completed in 623, at the Golden Pavilion of the Hōryū Temple, also near modern Nara. Though made of bronze, the sculptures by Tori and his school clearly indicate the strong influence of the art of stonecutting, which had been developed in China when cave sculptures were popular during the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534).
