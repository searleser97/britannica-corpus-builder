Uli figure,   wooden statue of a type carved in the villages of northern and central New Ireland, Papua New Guinea, that represents an ancestral or mythological personage in the secret uli rites. Only after a series of 13 festivals, held over a three-year period, is the construction of an uli figure completed, at which time celebrations are held before it.
The uli figures are carved and painted with powerfully expressed features and a clearly defined anatomy. The head is decorated with a helmetlike cap that has a pointed comb across the top. Sharply sculptured facial features give the visage a threatening appearance; the stocky torso, with both male and female sexual organs generously formed, is supported by massive legs, bent at the knees.
Characteristic of the uli figures is the inclusion in the main figure of smaller cult figures that duplicate the larger image. They are carved in the round and attached to the main body at the base, abdomen, or shoulders. It has been suggested that those on the shoulders are the arms of the uli, pointing upward. Completing the image is a complex of open latticework that entwines the figure from the breasts downward.
