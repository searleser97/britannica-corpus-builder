Germaine Richier,  (born September 16, 1902, Grans, near Arles, France—died July 31, 1959, Montpellier), French avant-garde sculptor of provocative biomorphic figures.
Richier studied art in Montpellier, went to in Paris in 1926, and learned to work with bronze in the studio of Antoine Bourdelle until 1929. In 1934 she began exhibiting classical busts, torsos, and figures (e.g., Loretto, 1934). Her talent was recognized already in the 1930s with a solo exhibition in 1934 at the Galerie Max Kaganovitch, the Blumenthal Prize for Sculpture in 1936, and an exhibition of her work at the Paris World’s Fair in 1937.
Richier spent World War II in Provence, France, and Zürich and exhibited work in the at the Kunstmuseum Winterthur, Zürich, in 1942, and at the Kunstmuseum Basel in 1944. For the latter show, she was in company with fellow sculptors Mario Marini and Fritz Wotruba. She returned to Paris after the war. By the 1940s her figures had become allegorical and sometimes hybridized expressions of humanity and nature, as in La Forêt (1946), a man with what look like tree branches for arms, and The Hurricane Woman (1948–49), a standing woman who is an allegory of human survival—in this case of World War II.  A fascination with insect forms and night creatures is exemplified in Praying Mantis (1946).
Richier worked also in ceramics, mosaic, and printmaking and illustrated Arthur Rimbaud’s Illuminations in 1951 and  Contre terre (1958), a volume of poems by her husband, René de Solier. Her unique personal imagery, however, is strongest in her sculptures of seemingly battered and tortured human forms. In the early 1950s she produced primeval figures with large hollow spaces or the mere suggestion of parts—e.g., Water (1953–54; bronze). Later, Richier experimented with coloured glass and lead figures and sculptures set against abstract backgrounds created by painters Maria Elena Vieira da Silva, Hans Hartung, and Zao Wou-ki. An important exhibition of her work was held at the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris in 1956, and her first solo exhibition in New York City took place the next year.
Following her early death from cancer in 1959, Richier was largely forgotten in the art world, her legacy visible only within the work of a handful of late 20th-century sculptors, such as Lynn Chadwick, César, and Reg Butler. In 2014, however, her oeuvre was resurrected in a exhibition of nearly 50 of her works at the Dominique Lévy Gallery and Galerie Perrotin in New York City as well as in a retrospective exhibition at the Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland.
