Ruthwell Cross,  cross bearing an important runic inscription in the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) language, from Ruthwell in the historic county of Dumfriesshire, Dumfries and Galloway council area, Scotland. The cross, which is an excellent example of Northumbrian art of the early 8th century, stands more than 18 feet (5.5 metres) high. Entirely religious in nature, it is carved with Gospel scenes and twining vines, as well as 18 verses of The Dream of the Rood, written entirely in runic letters. The inscription has linguistic significance because it contains six runic symbols indicating guttural sounds, whereas the Scandinavians employed only one or two. Much of the inscription is also copied in Latin. The Ruthwell Cross is similar in style to the Bewcastle Cross found in neighbouring Cumbria.
