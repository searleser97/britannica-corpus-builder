Patience Wright, original name Patience Lovell,  (born 1725, Bordentown, New Jersey, U.S.—died March 23, 1786, London, England), American sculptor of wax figures who achieved fame in the American colonies and England.
Patience Lovell was born into a prosperous Quaker farm family. In 1748 she married Joseph Wright. Little is known of her life from then until 1769, when she was left a widow with five children. About this time she began modeling in wax. Her recorded works consisted of detailed, life-sized heads and hands, which were then attached to clothed figures. Within a short time she created a traveling waxwork exhibit featuring remarkably skillful portraits of well-known public figures.
In February 1772 Wright sailed to England, where she created a popular exhibit of actors, politicians, nobles, and other prominent personages. The attraction of her work lay partly in its novelty (she preceded Madame Tussaud by 30 years), partly in her skill, and partly in her own blunt, eccentric personality: she was, for example, said to have addressed the king and queen as “George” and “Charlotte” when they posed for her. During the Revolutionary War Wright opened her London home to American prisoners of war and corresponded frequently with Benjamin Franklin in Paris. It has been reported that she passed on to Franklin military intelligence gleaned from her contacts in London society, but there is little evidence to support this. She also may have corresponded with members of the Continental Congress; according to one legend, she hid her letters in wax figures consigned to her sister in Philadelphia.
In 1780 Wright went to Paris to open a wax museum, but found little opportunity. Her son, Joseph Wright, was a painter, wax modeler, and diemaker.
