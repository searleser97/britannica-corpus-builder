Karl Humann,  (born Jan. 4, 1839, Steele, Prussia [Germany]—died  April 12, 1896, İzmir, Anatolia, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]), German engineer and archaeologist, whose excavation of the ancient Greek city of Pergamum (now Bergama, Tur.) brought to light some of the choicest examples of Hellenistic sculpture and revealed much about Hellenistic city planning.
While directing the construction of railway lines for the Ottoman government, Humann traveled extensively in Anatolia (Asia Minor) and was the first to note the archaeological importance of the ruins of Pergamum. His excavations there, under the auspices of the Berlin Museum (1878–86), disclosed the remains of many important public buildings and yielded a notable portion of the ornamental sculpture from the great altar of Zeus, which he reconstructed in Berlin.
Humann took part in an archaeological exploration of northern Syria (1888) and from 1891 to 1894 completed the excavation of another Hellenistic city in Turkey, Magnesia, on the Menderes (Maeander) River. His final years were occupied with the excavation of the remains of Priene. With various collaborators he published Ergebnisse der Ausgrabungen zu Pergamon, 3 vol. (1880–88; “Results of the Excavations at Pergamum”), and Reisen in Kleinasien und Nordsyrien, 2 vol. (1890; “Travels in Asia Minor and Northern Syria”).
