Déblé,   wooden figure carved in the form of a woman by the Senufo people of West Africa and used as a “rhythm pounder” in certain rituals performed to promote the fertility of the soil. Initiates of the Poro (or Lo) male secret society, performing their fertility dance, held the figures by the upper arms and pounded their heavy bases on the ground in unison to mark the rhythm. They also placed déblés in the fields during digging contests.
