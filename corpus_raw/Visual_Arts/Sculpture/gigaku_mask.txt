Gigaku mask,  stylized wooden mask worn by participants in gigaku, a type of Japanese dance drama. Gigaku masks are the first known masks used in Japan and among the world’s oldest extant masks. Soon after a Korean musician named Mimashi imported gigaku plays into Japan from China, in 612, Japanese artisans began to carve gigaku masks after Chinese models. Because the plays were often performed out-of-doors at court or temple, the masks were given greatly exaggerated features so they would retain their comic effect when viewed at a distance.
Gigaku masks, unlike the later bugaku masks, covered the entire head and had no movable parts. They were usually carved by Buddhist sculptors, and they exemplify the style and technique of contemporary Buddhist sculpture. The carving of gigaku masks reached its highest point during the Nara period (710–784) but was no longer practiced by the middle of the Heian period (c. 990), when it was superseded by the bugaku mask.
