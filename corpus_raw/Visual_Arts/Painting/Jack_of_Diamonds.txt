Jack of Diamonds, also called Knave of Diamonds, Russian Bubnovy Valet,  group of artists founded in Moscow in 1910 whose members were for the next few years the leading exponents of avant-garde art in Russia. The group’s first exhibition, held in December 1910, included works by the French Cubists Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, and André Lhote; other paintings were exhibited by Wassily Kandinsky and Alexey von Jawlensky, both Russian artists then living in Germany. The Russian members of the group themselves—Robert Falk, Natalya Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov, Aristarkh Lentulov, Aleksandr Kuprin, Pyotr Konchalovsky, and Ilya Mashkov—displayed portraits and still lifes that were strongly influenced by the French artists Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse. Kazimir Malevich also participated in the first exhibition.
In succeeding Jack of Diamonds exhibitions, works by the German painters Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Erich Heckel, and Max Pechstein were shown, as well as works by the French artist Fernand Léger. Also exhibiting with the group was Vladimir Tatlin, who later founded Russian Constructivism.
