Bamboccianti,  group of painters working in Rome in the mid-17th century who were known for their relatively small, often anecdotal paintings of everyday life. The word derives from the nickname “Il Bamboccio” (“Large Baby”), applied to the physically malformed Dutch painter Pieter van Laer (1592/95–1642). Generally regarded as the originator of the style and its most important exponent, van Laer arrived in Rome from Haarlem about 1625 and was soon well known for paintings in which his Netherlandish interest in the picturesque was combined with the pictorial cohesiveness of Caravaggio’s dramatic tenebrist lighting. Because van Laer and his followers depicted scenes of the Roman lower classes in a humorous or even grotesque fashion, their works were condemned by both court critics and the leading painters of the classicist-idealist school as indecorous and ridiculous. The painter Salvator Rosa was particularly savage in his comments about the later followers of the style, whom he criticized for painting “baggy pants, beggars in rags, and abject filthy things.” The Bamboccianti influenced such Dutch genre painters as Adriaen Brouwer and Adriaen van Ostade.
