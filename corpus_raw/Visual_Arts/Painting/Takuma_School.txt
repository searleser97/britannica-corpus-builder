Takuma School,  Japanese school of Buddhist painting that flourished from the 12th to the 14th century during the Kamakura period. It was founded by Takuma Tametō (active 1132–74) and continued by his son Tametatsu.
Two branches developed under two other sons: Shōga established the school in Kyōto and painted mainly for monasteries, while Tamehisa went to Kamakura, where he was in the service of the shoguns. The most notable Takuma painters in the 13th century were Tameyuki, Shunga, Chōga, and Jōkō, and in the 14th century, Chōshō, Ryōzen, and Eiga.
