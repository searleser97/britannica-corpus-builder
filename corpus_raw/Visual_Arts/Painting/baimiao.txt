Baimiao, (Chinese: “plain drawing”) Wade-Giles romanization pai-miao,  in Chinese painting, brush technique that produces a finely controlled, supple ink outline drawing without any colour or wash (diluted ink or paint applied in broad sweeps) embellishment. It is commonly used for figure painting, in which precise description is important.
Painting without outline but rather with forms achieved by washes of ink and colour is known as mogu, or “boneless.”
