Trompe l’oeil, (French: “deceive the eye”)  in painting, the representation of an object with such verisimilitude as to deceive the viewer concerning the material reality of the object. This idea appealed to the ancient Greeks who were newly emancipated from the conventional stylizations of earlier art. Zeuxis, for example, reportedly painted such realistic grapes that birds tried to eat them. The technique was also popular with Roman muralists. Although trompe l’oeil never achieved the status of a major artistic aim, European painters from the early Renaissance onward occasionally fostered illusionism by painting false frames out of which the contents of a still life or portrait appeared to spill or by creating windowlike images suggesting actual openings in the wall or ceiling.
In Italy in the 15th century an inlay work known as intarsia was used on choir stalls and in sacristies, frequently as trompe l’oeil views of cupboards with different articles seen upon the shelves through half-open doors. In America the 19th-century still-life painter William Harnett became famous for his card-rack paintings, on which are depicted various cards and clippings with such verisimilitude that the viewer becomes convinced that they can be lifted off the painted rack. In the late 20th century, muralist Richard Haas painted the exteriors of entire buildings in trompe l’oeil, primarily in Chicago and New York City. Aaron Bohrod was one of the foremost 20th-century practitioners of small-scale trompe l’oeil.
