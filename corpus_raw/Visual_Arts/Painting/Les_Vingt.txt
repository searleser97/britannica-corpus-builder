Les Vingt, also called Société Des Vingt, English The Twenty, or The Society of the Twenty,  group of artists who exhibited together in Belgium during the years 1891–93, having been brought together by a common interest in Symbolist painting. Like their French and German contemporaries, these painters, who were centred on Brussels, had shifted the emphasis in their works from the world of daily life outside the artist, which the Impressionists had caught, to the inner life, a world that celebrated mystery, allusion, and symbol.
Belgian Symbolist painting employed simplified forms, heavy outlines, a subjective use of colour, and a heightened spiritual content inspired by religious, exotic, and primitive cultures. These techniques were demonstrated in the paintings and graphics of James Ensor, Jan Toorop, and Henry van de Velde, all members of Les Vingt. The Société des Vingt members, and in particular Henry van de Velde, eventually transformed their own Symbolist styles into the designs of the Art Nouveau movement.
