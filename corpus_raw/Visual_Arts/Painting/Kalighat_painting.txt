Kālīghāṭ painting,   short-lived style of watercolour painting produced in the 19th century in India by artists in the Calcutta marketplace for sale to pilgrims visiting the Kālīghāṭ temple. The style is characterized by broad sweeping brush lines, bold colours, and simplification of forms suitable for their mass production.
The paintings, usually 17 by 11 inches (43 by 28 centimetres), were done on blank sheets, with no attempt made to fill in the backgrounds. Most usually depicted were the popular Hindu deities, but scenes of contemporary life are also found. The school, which rose in response to the competition of cheap coloured lithographs, soon lost the contest and disappeared rapidly. The charm and vigour of Kālīghāṭ painting had an influence on a number of modern Indian painters, as can be seen in the work of Jamini Roy.
