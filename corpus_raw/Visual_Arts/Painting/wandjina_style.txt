Wandjina style, also spelled Wondjina,  type of depiction in Australian cave paintings of figures that represent mythological beings associated with the creation of the world. Called wandjina figures, the images are believed by modern Aborigines to have been painted by the Wondjinas, prehistoric inhabitants of the Kimberley region in northwest Australia, the only area where cave paintings in the wandjina style have been found. Among the Aborigines, each wandjina image is renovated, or repainted, by the oldest living member supposedly descended from its originator.
Monumental and ghostlike, the wandjina figures are depicted without mouths, and the enlarged face is always painted white. The head is usually surrounded with a red halo or horseshoe motif with lines radiating outward. The limbs of the figures are portrayed in a summary manner, and the feet are often shown as footprints. The wandjina figures have a predominately white and ochre coloration because they symbolize the essence of water and blood.
