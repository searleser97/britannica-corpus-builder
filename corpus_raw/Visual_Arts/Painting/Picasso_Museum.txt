Picasso Museum, also called Musée National Picasso,  museum in Paris dedicated to showcasing the paintings, drawings, engravings, and sculptures of the Spanish-born artist Pablo Picasso.
The Picasso Museum opened in Paris in 1985 with a total of 228 paintings, 149 sculptures, and nearly 3,100 drawings and engravings. The artwork was collected after France’s inheritance-tax law had been amended to permit Picasso’s heirs to pay the taxes owed by his estate in art instead of money. As a result of that amendment, the French government formally owns paintings, sculptures, table reliefs, and ceramics as well as thousands of drawings and engravings by Picasso. In addition to the art itself, the museum houses virtually the entire collection of the artist’s preliminary studies. In the ensuing years, the museum acquired more items, and by the early 21st century, it had some 5,000 artworks by Picasso.
The collection is housed in the Hôtel Salé, built by the architect Jean de Bouiller between 1656 and 1659 in the Marais district of Paris. The building underwent extensive renovations prior to the museum’s opening, and in 2009 it closed for a major expansion. The project was plagued by various troubles, including cost overruns and construction problems, and the museum did not reopen until 2014.
The museum exhibits some 400 works, with many of Picasso’s larger sculptures gracing the outdoor gardens. Items from his personal collection of works by other artists, including Paul Cézanne, Henri Rousseau, and Henri Matisse, are also displayed.
