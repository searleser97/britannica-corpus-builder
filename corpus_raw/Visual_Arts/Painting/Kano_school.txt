Kanō school,  family of artists whose painting style dominated Japanese art from the 15th to the 19th century. For seven generations, more than 200 years, the leading Japanese artists came from this family, and the official style remained in their hands for another century or more. Throughout their history the family served military masters, and the lofty and moral symbolism of the Kanō tradition was at the same time the political ideal.
The school arose at a time when Chinese cultural ideals were dominant, but by that time there had been a long history of ink painting in Japan. The Kanō style, though it appears Chinese in subject matter and ink technique, was actually thoroughly Japanese in its form of expression. Gradually the depth of a picture was worked into two planes and later into a single plane of pictorial interest. The boldness of the brushwork is especially characteristic, and the sharpness of outline differed noticeably from that of the Chinese Song models. Surface values and flat decorative treatment were emphasized on screens and sliding panels.
The first Kanō was an amateur artist of the samurai class named Kagenobu. His son Masanobu (1434–1530) became the accepted first generation, but it was Motonobu (1476–1559), his son, who crystallized the Kanō style. Eitoku (1543–90) created the style of the Azuchi-Momoyama period, lasting from 1574 to 1600, while Tan’yū (1602–74) established the academic standards that pertained under the Tokugawa rulers (1603–1868).
