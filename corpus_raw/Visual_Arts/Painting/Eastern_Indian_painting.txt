Eastern Indian painting, also called Pala painting,  school of painting that flourished in the 11th and 12th centuries in the area of what are modern Bihar and Bengal. Its alternative name, Pala, derives from the name of the ruling dynasty of the period. The style is confined almost exclusively to conventional illustration on palm leaves depicting the life of the Buddha and Buddhist divinities.
The style disappeared from eastern India after the conquest of the area by the Muslims in the late 12th century, but many of its features were preserved in Nepal. The style also influenced the art of Tibet, to a lesser extent that of  Myanmar (Burma), and possibly even that of Sri Lanka and Java. The widespread nature of the influence is partly explainable by the travel of pilgrims who visited the great Buddhist centres of eastern India and carried back to their homes portable icons such as paintings and small bronzes.
The paintings mostly depict the numerous deities evoked by later Buddhism and were used to aid in the evocation of the deities. Accordingly, they had to conform to the same strict iconographic rules used in the production of contemporary stone and bronze icons.
The narrow leaf of the palm determined the size of the miniatures, which were about 2.25 by 3 inches (57 by 76 mm). The leaves were threaded together and enclosed in wooden covers, which typically were painted. The outlines were first drawn in black or red, then filled in with flat areas of colourâ€”red, blue, green, yellow, and touches of white. The compositions were simple and the modeling vestigial.
