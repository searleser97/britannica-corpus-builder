Pentimento,   (from Italian pentirsi: “to repent”), in art, the reappearance in an oil painting of original elements of drawing or painting that the artist tried to obliterate by overpainting. If the covering pigment becomes transparent, as may happen over the years, the ghostly remains of earlier marks may show through. Pentimenti most commonly occur owing to slight repositionings by the artist of the outlines of figures or of their clothing. Many signs of such “repentances,” or pentimenti, are found among the thinly painted Dutch panels of the 17th century. One of the most famous examples is a double hat brim in Rembrandt’s “Flora” (c. 1665; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City).
