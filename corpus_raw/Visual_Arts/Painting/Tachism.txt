Tachism, French Tachisme,   (from tache, “spot”), style of painting practiced in Paris after World War II and through the 1950s that, like its American equivalent, Action painting, featured the intuitive, spontaneous gesture of the artist’s brushstroke. Developed by the young painters Hans Hartung, Gérard Schneider, Pierre Soulages, Frans Wols, Chao Wu-chi (Zao Wu-ki), and Georges Mathieu, Tachism was part of a larger French postwar movement known as Art Informel, which abandoned geometric abstraction in favour of a more intuitive form of expression. Art Informel was inspired by the instinctive, personal approach of contemporary American Abstract Expressionism, of which Action painting was one aspect.
Like their American counterparts, the French-educated Tachists worked with a loaded brush, producing large works of sweeping brushstrokes and of drips, blots, stains, and splashes of colour. Their works, however, are more elegant and lyrical—often including graceful lines and blended, muted colours—than the works of such American painters as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, on whom the French artists modeled themselves. The Tachists were also less indebted than were the Action painters to uninhibited psychic inspiration.
