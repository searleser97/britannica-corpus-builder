Still-life painting,  depiction of inanimate objects for the sake of their qualities of form, colour, texture, and composition. Although decorative fresco murals and mosaics with still-life subjects occasionally appeared in antiquity, it was not until the Renaissance that still life emerged as an independent painting genre, rather than existing primarily as a subsidiary element in a composition. Early Netherlandish still-life paintings depicted skulls, candles, and hourglasses as allegories of mortality, or combined flowers and fruits of all seasons to symbolize nature’s cycle (see vanitas). An interest in observing and then realistically representing the material details of the environment, the rise of a wealthy middle class who desired art works to decorate their homes, and an increasing demand for secular subjects in painting other than portraiture as a result of the prolonged effects of the Reformation—all were factors that contributed to the rise of still-life painting in the 16th and 17th centuries. The painting generally considered to be the first still life is a work by the Italian painter Jacopo de’Barbari painted 1504. The “golden age” of still-life painting occurred in the Lowlands during the 17th century.
Among the most famous Dutch and Flemish painters who specialized in still-life subjects were Willem Heda, Willem Kalf, Jan Fyt, Frans Snyders, Jan Weenix, Melchior d’Hondecoeter, Jan van Huysum, and the de Heem family. From the 18th century until the rise of Nonobjective painting after World War II, France became the centre of still-life painting. Most major artists who at some time resided there during this 250-year period executed still lifes—e.g., J.-B.-S. Chardin, Eugène Delacroix, Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, and Pierre Bonnard.
