Eight Masters of Nanjing, Pinyin Jinling Bajia, Wade-Giles romanization Chin-ling Pa-chia,  group of Chinese artists who lived and worked during the late 17th century in Nanjing (known as Jinling during the early Tang dynasty, c. 7th century). Although their group identity derives largely from the locale in which they worked, certain aesthetic similarities are discernible: their paintings, usually landscapes, are often uneven in quality and rather rustic.
The outstanding artist of the group, Gong Xian, is known particularly for his dense, moist landscapes, which are unusual in the history of Chinese painting. Others of the group include Fan Qi, Gao Cen, Zou Zhe, Wu Hong, Hu Zao, Ye Xin, and Xie Sun. Little is known of most of these artists, and few of their paintings survive.
