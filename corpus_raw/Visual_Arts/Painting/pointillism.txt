Pointillism, also called divisionism and chromo-luminarism,  in painting, the practice of applying small strokes or dots of colour to a surface so that from a distance they visually blend together. The technique is associated with its inventor, Georges Seurat, and his student, Paul Signac, who both espoused Neo-Impressionism, a movement that flourished from the late 1880s to the first decade of the 20th century.
