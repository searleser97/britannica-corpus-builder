Baghdad school,   stylistic movement of Islāmic manuscript illustration, founded in the late 12th century (though the earliest surviving works cannot be dated before the 13th century). The school flourished in the period when the ʿAbbāsid caliphs had reasserted their authority in Baghdad. Characterized by the depiction of expressive, individualized faces rather than facial types, a suggestion of movement, and attention to the details of everyday life, work of this school continued to appear for some 40 years following the destruction of the city by the Mongols in 1258.
Early examples of Baghdad-school miniatures are illustrations from an Arabic translation of Dioscorides’ medical treatise, De materia medica, dated 1224 (the manuscript is scattered among several private collections and museums). The paintings embody the traditional elements of the Baghdad school—strong colours, a well-developed sense of design, and expressive facial features. Frames do not appear; the miniatures illustrate the text and often appear between lines of it.
The miniatures made to illustrate manuscripts of the Maqāmāt of al-Ḥarīrī, between 1225 and the fall of the city to the Mongols in 1258, were among the finest works in all Arab painting; the finest, most complete, and best-preserved of these manuscripts is that in the collection of the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, dated 1237.
The frontispiece to a book, “The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren,” dated 1287, demonstrates that the main stylistic elements of the Baghdad school survived to the last. This illustration, in the Mosque of Süleyman in Istanbul, again shows realism in detail while maintaining an overall decorative quality. The authors of the book are depicted with their scribes, and attention is drawn to the faces. By the early 1300s, the school had died out, and painting in the area began to take on many characteristics of the Mongol schools.
