Macaroni,  in art, Late Paleolithic finger tracings in clay. It is one of the oldest and simplest known forms of art. Innumerable examples appear on the walls and ceilings of limestone caves in France and Spain (see Franco-Cantabrian art), the oldest dating back about 30,000 years. Examples of the form range from simple scratchings and jumbled, apparently aimless lines to deliberate meanders, arabesques, and outline drawings of animals and humans.
