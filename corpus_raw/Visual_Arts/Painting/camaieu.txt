Camaieu, plural camaieux,  painting technique by which an image is executed either entirely in shades or tints of a single colour or in several hues unnatural to the object, figure, or scene represented. When a picture is monochromatically rendered in gray, it is called grisaille; when in yellow, cirage. Originating in the ancient world, camaieu was used in miniature painting to simulate cameos and in architectural decoration to simulate relief sculpture.
