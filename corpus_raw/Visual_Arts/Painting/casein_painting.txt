Casein painting,   painting executed with colours ground in a solution of casein, a phosphoprotein of milk precipitated by heating with an acid or by lactic acid in souring. In the form of homemade curd made from soured skim milk, it has been a traditional adhesive and binder for more than eight centuries. Refined, pure, powdered casein, which can be dissolved with ammonia, has been used for easel and mural paintings since the latter 19th and early 20th centuries, and, more recently, ready-made casein paints in tubes have come into very wide use. An advantage of casein painting is that it can create effects that approach those of oil painting. It permits the use of bristle brushes and a moderate impasto, like oil painting, but not the fusion of tones. It is preferred by some because of speedy drying and matte effects. When dry, the paint becomes water resistant to a considerable degree. Casein paintings may be varnished to further resemble oil paintings, and they are frequently glazed or overpainted with oil colours. Because casein is too brittle for canvas, it must be applied to rigid boards or panels.
