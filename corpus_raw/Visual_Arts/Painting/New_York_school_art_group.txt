New York school,   those painters who participated in the development of contemporary art from the early 1940s in or around New York City. During and after World War II, leadership in avant-garde art shifted from war-torn Europe to New York, and the New York school maintained a dominant position in world art into the 1980s. Abstract Expressionism, the most important art movement to emerge after World War II, Minimal art, Pop art, and new realist styles of the late 1960s, among others, all had their beginnings in New York.
