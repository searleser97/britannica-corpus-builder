Company school, also called Patna painting,  style of miniature painting that developed in India in the second half of the 18th century in response to the tastes of the British serving with the East India Company. The style first emerged in Murshidabad, West Bengal, and then spread to other centres of British trade: Benares (Varanasi), Delhi, Lucknow, and Patna.
The paintings were executed in watercolours on paper and on mica. Favourite subjects were scenes of Indian daily life, local rulers, and sets of festivals and ceremonies, in line with the “cult of the picturesque” then current in British artistic circles. Most successful were the studies of natural life, but the style was generally of a hybrid and undistinguished quality.
