Colour-field painting,  with Action painting, one of two major strains of the 20th-century art movement known as Abstract Expressionism or the New York school. The term typically describes large-scale canvases dominated by flat expanses of colour and having a minimum of surface detail. Colour-field paintings have a unified single-image field and differ qualitatively from the gestural, expressive brushwork of such artists as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Colour-field painting was identified in the mid-1950s by the American art critic Clement Greenberg, who then used the term post-painterly abstraction to describe the next generation of work by a group of painters that included Morris Louis, Helen Frankenthaler, and Kenneth Noland.
In his influential essay “Modernist Painting” (1961), Greenberg articulated the idea that painting should be self-critical, addressing only its inherent properties—namely, flatness and colour. He declared that “Modernism used art to call attention to art,” and in his writings of this period he traced the lineage of colour-field painting back to the unmodulated figure rendering of the 19th-century French painter Édouard Manet through the large abstractions of Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman.
The notion of colour-field painting implied that only optical responses were significant in painting. Subject matter was forbidden and illusionism condemned. Frankenthaler’s stained paintings perfectly embodied Greenberg’s formalist direction by making surface and colour inseparable. She literally soaked the unprimed canvas with pigment, creating fields of amorphous colour. Inspired by Frankenthaler’s stained paintings, Morris Louis began soaking his canvases in the late 1950s. He also eliminated the brushstroke altogether by pouring viscous lines of multicoloured paint to create rainbow effects. Like Jasper Johns before him, Noland used the banal target as a found design with which to examine different hues and values of flat colour.
