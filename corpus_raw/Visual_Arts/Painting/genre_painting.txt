Genre painting,  painting of scenes from everyday life, of ordinary people in work or recreation, depicted in a generally realistic manner. Genre art contrasts with that of landscape, portraiture, still life, religious themes, historic events, or any kind of traditionally idealized subject matter. Intimate scenes from daily life are almost invariably the subject of genre painting. The elimination of imaginative content and of idealization focuses attention upon the shrewd observation of types, costumes, and settings.
The term arose in 18th-century France to describe painters specializing in one kind (genre) of picture, such as flowers or animals or middle-class life, and was originally used derogatively by advocates of the ideal or grand manner in art. By the late 19th century, when the Swiss critic Jacob Burckhardt wrote Netherland Genre Painting (1874), the term was more approving and also was restricted to its current sense. The term is still most popularly used to describe the works of such 17th-century Dutch and Flemish painters as Jan Steen, Gerard Terborch, Adriaen van Ostade, David Teniers the Younger, Pieter de Hooch, and Johannes Vermeer. Later masters of genre art have included such various artists as Cornelis Troost in the Netherlands, David Wilkie in Britain, Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin in France, Pietro Longhi in Italy, and George Caleb Bingham in the United States.
