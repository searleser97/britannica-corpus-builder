Rājput painting,   the art of the independent Hindu feudal states in India, as distinguished from the court art of the Mughal emperors. Whereas Mughal painting was contemporary in style, Rājput was traditional and romantic.
It developed in the 16th and early 17th centuries, and its late period lasted through 1825. Rājput painting is further divided into Rājasthanī painting (q.v.), or the schools of the Rājasthān and central India, and Pahari painting (q.v.), or the art of the Himalayan kingdoms.
