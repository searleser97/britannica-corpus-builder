The Ten,  group of 10 American painters who first exhibited together in 1898, in New York City, and continued to do so for the next 20 years. Most members of the group painted in an Impressionist style. Although their work did not differ radically in technique or subject matter from that of the artists who participated in the large annual exhibitions of the Society of American Artists and the National Academy of Design, they chose to exhibit independently, hoping to draw public attention to their paintings. The members of the Ten were Childe Hassam, John Henry Twachtman, J. Alden Weir, Thomas W. Dewing, Joseph De Camp, Frank W. Benson, Willard Leroy Metcalf, Edmund Tarbell, Robert Reid, and E.E. Simmons. When Twachtman died in 1902, William Merritt Chase replaced him.
