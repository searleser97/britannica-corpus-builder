London Group,  English artists’ association founded in November 1913 for the purpose of joint exhibition.
The London Group was formed in opposition to the conservative Royal Academy and as an alternative to the New English Art Club, another exhibiting association. The London Group brought together several English artists’ alliances, the most important of which was the Camden Town Group, whose members included the painters Harold Gilman, Walter Sickert, and Spencer Gore. These artists, along with their allies Charles Ginner and Lucien Pissarro, advocated depicting the urban and working classes, and they favoured the light palette and high-keyed colour of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists.
Some considerably more radical painters, whose work was strongly influenced by Cubist and Futurist geometry and colour, also joined the London Group. These included the abstract sculptor Jacob Epstein, the Vorticists Wyndham Lewis and Edward Wadsworth, and the Cubist painter David Bomberg.
The group’s first official exhibit took place in March 1914. The group was noted for the diversity of its membership and the controversy that attended its exhibitions. The radical and conservative artists coexisted in the London Group until late 1915, when most of the radicals left London to serve in World War I.
Painters from a group of artists and writers associated with the Bloomsbury district of London later joined: Roger Fry in 1917, and Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell in 1919. The London Group remained a significant force in English avant-garde art until the 1930s; it still exists as a biennial exhibiting society.
