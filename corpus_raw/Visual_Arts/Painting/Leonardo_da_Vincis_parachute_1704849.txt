Leonardo da Vinci discussed the parachute in a notebook entry now contained in the Codex Atlanticus. Although it is unlikely that he actually tested his idea, a drawing by da Vinci in the codex shows a pyramid-shaped parachute and is accompanied by the following text:
On June 26, 2000, British balloonist Adrian Nicholas proved da Vinci right. In a parachute built of wood and canvas to the artist’s specifications, Nicholas was hoisted to 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) by a hot-air balloon and then released. He slowly and gently floated downward in da Vinci’s parachute, disproving predictions that the structure would not keep a man aloft. Fear that the weight of the parachute, some 185 pounds (84 kg), could crash down on top of Nicholas upon landing caused him to cut away the da Vinci parachute at 2,000 feet (600 metres) and use a conventional parachute for the remaining descent.
