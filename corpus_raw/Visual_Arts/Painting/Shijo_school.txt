Shijō school, also called Maruyama School,  Japanese school of naturalistic painting that was founded in the late 18th century by Maruyama Masataka (Ōkyo) and was made popular by his pupils, among them Matsumura Gekkei, called Goshun, from whose residence on Fourth Street (Shijō), in Kyōto, the movement took its name. Among the most important artists associated with the school were Matsumura Keibun and Okamoto Toyohiko.
The Shijō style was an important influence on painting in Kyōto during the Edo period. It was revived in the Meiji period by Kōno Bairei.
