Wenrenhua, (Chinese: “literati painting”) Wade-Giles romanization wen-jen-hua,  ideal form of the Chinese scholar-painter who was more interested in personal erudition and expression than in literal representation or an immediately attractive surface beauty. First formulated in the Northern Song period (960–1127)—at which time it was called shidafuhua—by the poet-calligrapher Su Dongpo, the ideal of wenrenhua was finally and enduringly codified by the great Ming dynasty critic and painter Dong Qichang, who identified two great lineages of painters.
One lineage was the “Southern school,” beginning with the poet-painter Wang Wei in the Tang dynasty and continuing with such masters as Dong Yuan and Juran in the Five Dynasties period, Mi Fu in the Northern Song, the Four Masters of the Yuan dynasty, and the Wu school artists of the second half of the 15th and first half of the 16th centuries (Ming dynasty). The paintings of the artists in this grouping are characterized generally by subjective, personal, and expressive treatment of reality. In contrast were those artists more interested in precise and decorative paintings, beginning with Li Sixun in the Tang dynasty and continuing with artists of the Southern Song academy and their heirs of the 15th-century Zhe school in the Ming dynasty. According to the principle of wenrenhua, the completely literate, cultured artist—learned in all the humane arts—who revealed the privacy of his vision in his painting was preferred over the “professional,” whose paintings were more obviously pleasing to the eye. The contrast is overly categorical, but it is useful still in understanding the major interests and intentions of Chinese painters through the ages.
