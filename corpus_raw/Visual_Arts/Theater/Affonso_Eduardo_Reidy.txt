Affonso Reidy,  (born Oct. 26, 1909, Paris—died  Aug. 11, 1964, Rio de Janeiro), Brazilian architect, a pioneer of the modern architectural movement in Brazil.
Reidy graduated from the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes, Rio de Janeiro, in 1930. He was one of the team of architects, which included Le Corbusier, that designed the Ministry of Education and Health in Rio de Janeiro (1937–43), a classic example of modern architecture in Latin America. Reidy’s work consisted mainly of large projects: theatres, museums, schools, and blocks of office buildings. Among his most admired works are the Pedregulho Residential Neighborhood (1947–55), notable for its use of the curving contours of the site, and the Marechal Hermes Theatre (1950), also in Rio de Janeiro, which had an inverted, double-slope roof and a garden designed by the Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx.
The Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro, begun in 1954, is perhaps Reidy’s most striking design: rows of angled concrete ribs support and enclose the gallery spaces. Another important work was the Rio City Employees Insurance Fund Building (1957–62), which had a particularly attractive facade: a reinforced concrete grid was used in combination with adjustable aluminum blinds to achieve sunlight control.
