Hector-Martin Lefuel,  (born Nov. 14, 1810, Versailles, Fr.—died  Dec. 31, 1880, Paris), French architect who completed the new Louvre in Paris, a structure that was seen as a primary symbol of Second Empire architecture in the late 19th century.
Lefuel was the son of a building contractor. He studied with Jean-Nicolas Huyot and received the Prix de Rome of the Academy in 1839. His design for the theatre at Fontainebleau, in an 18th-century style, led to his appointment as successor to L.-T.-J. Visconti in the project to build a connecting structure between the old Louvre and the Tuileries. He retained much of Visconti’s original plan but introduced some modifications of his own, especially on the side of the rue de Rivoli, where he added rich ornamentation and made extensive use of iron. Lefuel relied on structural motifs already present in the older buildings, but the resulting effects were almost entirely original. Most striking are the corner and central pavilions. Projecting from the corners of the steep mansard roof are stone dormers ornamented in a nearly Baroque manner. The central pavilions flanking the Cour du Carrousel have convex mansard roofs forming, as it were, “square” domes. Such features were imitated all over the world for the next 30 years and came to be symbolic of Second Empire architectural style.
Lefuel’s other works included the Hôtel Fould and Hôtel Nieuwerkerke (both destroyed) and a palais provisoire of wood for the Exposition of 1855.
