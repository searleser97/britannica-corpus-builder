Zāwiyah, Persian khānqāh, Turkish tekke,  generally, in the Muslim world, a monastic complex, usually the centre or a settlement of a Sufi (mystical) brotherhood. In some Arabic countries the Arabic term zāwiyah is also used for any small private oratory not paid for by community funds.
The first North African zāwiyah, dating from about the 13th century, was akin to a hermitage (rābiṭah), housing an ascetic holy man and his disciples. Linked as it was to the immensely popular Sufi movement that was making its way westward across North Africa at the same time, the zāwiyah seems to have proliferated rapidly. Eventually it became an extensive centre of religious and paramilitary power. The essential structure of the medieval zāwiyah has survived into the 21st century. It may include an area reserved for prayer, a shrine, a religious school, and residential quarters for students, guests, pilgrims, and travelers.
In the mid-19th century the Sānusiyyah, a religious brotherhood of Cyrenaica (modern Libya), by establishing a network of zāwiyahs in areas remote from central authority, attained political as well as religious control of the province. In World War I the Sānusiyyah was able to marshal members of the zāwiyahs into war against the Italians. In their subsequent occupation of Libya, the Italians wiped out most of the zāwiyahs in that country.
