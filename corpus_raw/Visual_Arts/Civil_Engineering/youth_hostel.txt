Youth hostel,  supervised shelter providing inexpensive overnight lodging, particularly for young people. Hostels range from simple accommodations in a farm house to hotels able to house several hundred guests for days at a time. They are located in many parts of the world, usually in scenic areas, and are spaced at intervals so that hostelers can hike, bicycle, or canoe from one to the next in a day. Hostelers often cook their own meals, make their own beds, and do other light work to help maintain the hostel. In return they receive lodging at much less than the usual commercial rate. In some countries hostels impose a maximum age limit on guests. Limits on the length of stay are also common.
Youth hostels were common in Germany in the early 1900s. After World War I they spread rapidly through Europe and other areas of the world. The International Youth Hostel Federation was formed in 1932 to coordinate activities of the various national youth hostel associations and to facilitate international travel by members; by 1980 its membership included national federations in 50 countries. National organizations regularly publish handbooks describing hostel locations and facilities.
