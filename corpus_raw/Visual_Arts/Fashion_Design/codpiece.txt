Codpiece,  pouchlike addition to men’s long hose, located at the crotch, popular in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries. It came into fashion with hose that were like tights and continued to be worn with breeches.
An earlier, narrower form of codpiece, worn with a belt or a loincloth, was the basic fashion for men in the Aegean area during the Bronze Age. The codpiece did not reemerge in Europe as a significant component of men’s dress until the 15th century. Before then, European men’s fashions were relatively open at the groin area, which was covered by the tunic or doublet. The codpiece was created to address this issue as men’s hemlines rose during the 15th century.
Originally simply a wedge-shaped bag of fabric tied at the sides, codpieces became increasingly padded and enlarged in order to emphasize the male genitalia. They were also sometimes used as purses in which small items such as money and handkerchiefs were stored. In the early and mid-16th century the codpiece was padded, prominent, and decorated, even with jewels, but by the end of the century it was mocked and thought indecent. After the pouch had disappeared, the name continued to be used into the 18th century for the front fastening of breeches. From the late 20th century codpieces were also worn by a number of heavy metal musicians known for their theatrical stage acts, including Gene Simmons of the band Kiss and Alice Cooper.
