Moccasin,   heelless shoe of soft leather, the sole of which may be hard or soft and flexible; in soft-soled moccasins, the sole is brought up the sides of the foot and over the toes, where it is joined by a puckered seam to a U-shaped piece lying on top of the foot. The upper part of the moccasin is often adorned with embroidery, beading, or other ornament.
From earliest times the moccasin was the footwear of North American Indians and was also worn by hunters, traders, and settlers. In the second half of the 20th century, moccasins became a popular sport and casual shoe. The term can also apply to slip-on shoes with a lap seam on the forefront of the vamp, imitating the seam of the true moccasin.
