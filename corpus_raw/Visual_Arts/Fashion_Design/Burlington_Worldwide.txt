Burlington Worldwide,  major textile manufacturer, producer of finished and unfinished fabrics for garments, upholstery fabrics, and other home accessory fabrics. The company also makes specialty fabrics for athletic, medical, waterproof, and windproof garments. Headquarters are in Greensboro, N.C.
The company was incorporated as Burlington Mills, Inc., in 1923 when J. Spencer Love acquired a mill in the Burlington, N.C., area. His company grew rapidly, soon growing to 30 textile mills. In 1937 the corporate name was changed to Burlington Mills Corporation. In 1955 the name was changed to Burlington Industries to reflect the company’s more diversified product line. In 1960 Burlington entered the carpet industry and in 1966 added furniture to its products. Further diversification followed.
The company’s growth has always been dependent on changing fashions and, to some extent, has paralleled the development of synthetic fabrics.
