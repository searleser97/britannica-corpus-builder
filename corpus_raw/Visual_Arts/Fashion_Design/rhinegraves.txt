Rhinegraves,   wide breeches worn by men in the mid-17th century in Europe. The breeches were probably named for Karl Florentin, Rheingraf von Salm. Not unlike a divided skirt, they were sometimes called “petticoat breeches.” They were usually fastened above the knee and decorated with ribbons. In England, rhinegraves were fashionable from 1660 until 1666, when Charles II dropped the style.
