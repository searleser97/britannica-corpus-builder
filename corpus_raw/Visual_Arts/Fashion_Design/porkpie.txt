Porkpie,  round hat with a turned-up brim and a flat crown. The porkpie, so called because of its shape, became popular with both men and women in the mid-19th century, though a similarly shaped hat had been worn in the European Middle Ages.
In the 19th century the porkpie worn by men sometimes had ribbons flowing down the back. Women wore tiny porkpies, tipped forward over the forehead because of the elaborate coiffures at the back of the head. During the early to mid-20th century, porkpie hats were popularized by a number of actors and musicians, including Buster Keaton, Dean Martin, and Lester Young. They enjoyed a resurgence after being worn by the protagonist Popeye Doyle (played by Gene Hackman) in the film The French Connection (1971). They became popular again in the late 20th and early 21st century, when they were worn by celebrities including Justin Timberlake, Sean Combs, and Brad Pitt.
