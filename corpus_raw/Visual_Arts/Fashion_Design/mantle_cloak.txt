Mantle,   cloak fashioned from a rectangular piece of cloth, usually sleeveless, of varying width and length, wrapped loosely around the body. Usually worn as an outer garment in the ancient Mediterranean world, it developed in different styles, colours, and materials. The Greek chlamys (worn only by men) was a short mantle draped around the upper shoulders, pinned on the right shoulder with a brooch. It left the right arm free and was often used by travellers and military men. The Greek himation, draped in various ways, was a larger Greek mantle.
Some Christian religious vestments, such as the cope and the pallium, probably developed from the mantle.
