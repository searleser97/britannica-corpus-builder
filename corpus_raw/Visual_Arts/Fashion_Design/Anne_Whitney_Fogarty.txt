Anne Whitney Fogarty,  (born February 2, 1919, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died January 15, 1980, New York, New York), American fashion designer, best known for her original dress design.
Fogarty created her unique design in the early 1950s. Her ultra-feminine shirtwaist dress featured a tiny waist and a bouffant ballerina skirt, supported by as many as a dozen petticoats. Fogarty’s design revolutionized junior fashions and became known as the young "American look." Fogarty worked as a model and designed dresses for Youth Guild before joining (1950) Margot Dresses, where she popularized her shirtwaist dresses of printed cotton, denim, and linen. She then designed (1958–62) an exclusive women’s collection for Saks Fifth Avenue stores, and later, with Leonard Sunshine, she designed collections on Seventh Avenue, including dresses for Tricia Nixon.
