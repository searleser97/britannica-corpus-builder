zipper, also called slide fastener,  device for binding the edges of an opening such as on a garment or a bag. A zipper consists of two strips of material with metal or plastic teeth along the edges and with a sliding piece that draws the teeth into interlocking position when moved in one direction and separates them again when moved in the opposite direction.
The idea of a slide fastener was exhibited by Whitcomb L. Judson at the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago. Judson’s fastener, called a clasp locker, was an arrangement of hooks and eyes with a slide clasp for closing and opening. Gideon Sundback, a Swedish engineer working in the United States, substituted spring clips in place of hooks and eyes, and his Hookless #2 (now considered the first modern zipper) went on sale in 1914; a patent was granted three years later. A similar device had been patented in 1911 in Europe by Katharina Kuhn-Moos and Henri Forster, though it was apparently never manufactured.
In 1917 the U.S. Navy equipped windproof flying suits with slide fasteners. In the late 1920s and early 1930s they appeared on clothing for both men and women. In 1923 B.G. Work of the B.F. Goodrich Company gave the name zipper to the slide fastener that had just been adopted for closing overshoes.
