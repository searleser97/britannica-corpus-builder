Buskin,  a thick-soled boot worn by actors in ancient Greek tragedies. Because of the association, the term has come to mean tragedy. It is contrasted with sock, which refers to the foot covering worn by actors in comedies. The word is probably a modification of the Middle French brouzequin, “a kind of foot covering.”
