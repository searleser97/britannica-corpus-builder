Muff,   in wearing apparel, usually cylindrical covering of fur, fabric, feathers, or other soft material, with open ends into which the hands are placed to keep them warm. Originally a purse and hand warmer in one, the muff was first introduced to women’s fashion in 1570, when fur trimming was becoming popular.
In the 17th century they were used by both men and women. In the 19th century, however, muffs were considered an essential accessory only for feminine dress and ranged from large down muffs to small fur or velvet ones matching the trim on a woman’s dress.
