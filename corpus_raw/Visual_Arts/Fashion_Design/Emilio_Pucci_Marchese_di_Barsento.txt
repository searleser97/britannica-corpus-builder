Emilio Pucci, marquis di Barsento,  (born Nov. 20, 1914, Naples, Italy—died  Nov. 29, 1992, Florence), Italian fashion designer and politician.
Pucci, who came from a wealthy, aristocratic Florentine family, was educated for a diplomatic career. He earned a Ph.D. in social science but entered the Italian air force in 1941 and remained in the service after the end of World War II. When Pucci was on leave from the air force in 1947, a Harper’s Bazaar photographer noticed his original ski outfit and asked him to design women’s ski clothes. His brilliantly coloured, free-moving sportswear was first presented as a complete collection in 1950 and was enthusiastically received. He became best known for tight, shantung “Pucci” pants and, among his most widely copied creations, vividly printed silk jersey dresses and blouses. Pucci designed undergarments, knitwear, swimwear, and accessories. He also manufactured ceramics and perfume and branched into men’s fashion design. The colourful, less formal uniforms he created for Braniff Airways flight attendants were the first of their kind. During the 1960s Pucci prints were worn by fashionable women throughout the world; his designs enjoyed a revival in the late 1980s and early ’90s. Pucci received many awards for his designs, including the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award (1954) and the Harper’s Bazaar Medallion.
From the early 1960s Pucci was an active member of the Liberal Party. Representing the Florence constituency, he held a seat in the Italian Parliament from 1963 to 1972, and he continued to serve as a Florence city counselor.
