Rabato, also spelled Rebato,  wide, often lace-edged collar wired to stand up at the back of the head, worn by both men and women in the 16th and early 17th centuries. An example may be found in some of the portraits of Queen Elizabeth I, which often show her with a lace or gauze rabato rising up at the back of the neck in the shape of wings.
The turned-back rabato was sometimes used as the support or base for a ruff, the crimped or pleated frill fashionable during the same period. The rabat collar was much smaller than the rabato, and the rabatine collar fell over the shoulders much like a cape.
