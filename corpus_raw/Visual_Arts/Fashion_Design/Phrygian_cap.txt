Phrygian cap,  soft felt or wool conical headdress fitting closely around the head and characterized by a pointed crown that curls forward. It originated in the ancient country of Phrygia in Anatolia and is represented in ancient Greek art as the type of headdress worn not only by Phrygians but by all inhabitants of Anatolia and of nations farther east.
The Phrygian cap might have been mistaken for the pileus, a cap worn by emancipated Roman slaves, when it became an emblem of liberty during the French Revolution (1787–99). It was adopted by the revolutionaries as “the red cap of liberty” and continues to be associated with the national allegorical figure of Liberté.
