Mola,  type of embroidered woman’s outer garment, worn as part of the blouse by the Kuna Indians of the San Blas Archipelago, off the eastern coast of Panama. The mola’s brightly coloured designs, done in reverse appliqué technique, traditionally are abstract, often based on the patterns of brain coral. Recently, schematically drawn figurative designs have become frequent.
The origin of the mola remains uncertain. It is known, however, to have first appeared during the early period of Spanish colonization, and its patterns may constitute a residual of pre-Hispanic body-painting designs. Today the mola is used not only for a garment but also for a wall hanging or other interior home decoration.
