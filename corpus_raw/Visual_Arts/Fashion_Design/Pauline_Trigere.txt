Pauline Trigère,  (born November 4, 1908, Paris, France—died February 13, 2002, New York, New York, U.S.), French-born American couturiere whose award-winning design work was especially popular in the United States in the 1950s and ’60s.
Trigère was the daughter of a tailor. She early learned to sew and helped her mother custom-tailor women’s clothes. After graduating from the Collège Victor Hugo in Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris, she went to work in the salon of Martial et Armand in the Place Vendôme, where she learned how to design and construct women’s clothing. In 1937 she moved to the United States and seven years later became a U.S. citizen.
In 1942, after working for several New York fashion houses, Trigère established Trigère, Inc., in order to produce her own designs. Her mastery of French styling attracted major buyers across the country, and as her personal style developed she assumed a position at the forefront of American couture. In 1949 she received the Coty American Fashion Critics’ Award, an honour repeated in 1951 and in 1959; on the latter occasion she was inducted into the Coty Fashion Hall of Fame. While her designs were generally conservative, Trigère pioneered the use of cotton and wool fabrics for evening dresses and devised such novelties as the reversible coat, the mobile collar, the spiral jacket, and the sleeveless coat. Outspoken and noted for her strong beliefs, she became in 1961 the first major designer to employ an African American model.
By 1958 Trigère, Inc., enjoyed annual sales in excess of $2 million, and by 1992 Trigère was the only designer to have remained in business for 50 years; she closed her company in 1994, although she continued to design accessories. She received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1993. In 2001 Trigère was awarded the French Legion of Honour.
