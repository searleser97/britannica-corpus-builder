Paul Storr,  (born 1771, Londonâ€”died  March 4, 1844, London), goldsmith particularly noted for his outstanding craftsmanship in the execution of richly ornamented works, especially presentation silver. A notable example is the cup made for presentation to the British admiral Lord Nelson to mark his victory at the battle of the Nile in 1798 (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London).
Storr served an apprenticeship with Andrew Fogelberg, a plate worker of Swedish origin, after which he established his own shop (1796); later, in 1807, he began an association with Rundell and Bridge (later Rundell, Bridge and Rundell), a firm of royal goldsmiths.
For this firm he carried out many commissions, and his work ranged from simple tableware to the highly ornate work for which he is best known. In many cases the firm used his services merely as a craftsman, the design work being carried out by others. Some of his designs were based on ancient Roman silver; others were in a revived Rococo style. He broke with the firm in 1819 and three years later formed a partnership with John Mortimer, which continued until 1838.
