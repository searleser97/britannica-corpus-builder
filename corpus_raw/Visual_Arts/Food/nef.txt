Nef,   European vessel in the form of a medieval ship, often complete with rigging. Although occasionally made of Venetian glass, nefs were usually elaborately constructed of precious metals and sometimes had a hull of rock crystal, hardstone, or nautilus shell. Perhaps first used as a drinking vessel, it had, by the 14th century, become a table ornament to denote the hostâ€™s place or a container (usually smaller) for salt and spices or table utensils. More rarely it was used as an alms dish in royal households. Although still being made in the early 17th century in Germany, the nef had declined in artistic importance and had virtually ceased to exist in the rest of Europe.
