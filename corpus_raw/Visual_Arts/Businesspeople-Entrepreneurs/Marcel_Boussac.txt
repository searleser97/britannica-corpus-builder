Marcel Boussac,  (born April 17, 1889, Châteauroux, Fr.—died  March 21, 1980, near Paris), French industrialist and textile manufacturer whose introduction of colour into clothing ended the “black look” in France.
The second son of a dry-goods dealer and clothing manufacturer, Boussac took over the family business at age 18. In 1910 he set up his cotton works in the textile quarter of Paris. This became the nerve centre of an immense business called Les Établissements Boussac, which served as its own banker and insurance broker.
In 1915 he created the airplane cloth (toile d’avion) industry and rebought all the government stocks of this cloth in 1918. Between World Wars I and II he established his Toile d’Avion chain of retail shops. In 1947 he also opened the fashionable couturier House of Dior. Boussac also manufactured electrical home appliances and acquired the Paris daily paper L’Aurore.
In 1978, however, the Boussac economic empire collapsed as creditors closed in and the French government refused to subsidize his operations further, to cancel a $20 million debt, or to allow him to transform his horse-grazing lands near Notre Dame into a housing development. He then sold out to the French conglomerate of Agache-Willot for $175,000,000. He died at his château near Paris.
