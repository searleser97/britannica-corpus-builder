Ravinia Park,  one of the oldest outdoor summer music and cultural centres in the United States, located in Highland Park, Illinois, about 20 miles (30 km) north of downtown Chicago. It was established in 1904 on land purchased by the A.C. Frost Company, a subsidiary of the Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railroad. Originally an amusement centre designed to stimulate railroad business, the 36-acre (15-hectare) park developed into a cultural institution devoted to fine arts.
The original pavilion, destroyed by fire in 1949, was replaced in 1950 by a bowl-shaped structure seating 3,300 people. The John D. Harza Building houses performance spaces and is open year-round. The Martin Theatre is also on park grounds. Since 1936 Ravinia has been the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The Ravinia Festival holds daily music and dance programs.
