Conrat Meit,  (born c. 1475, Worms, Bishopric of Worms—died  1550/51, Antwerp), Flemish sculptor and medalist known for the realistic portraits that he produced during the Northern Renaissance. Meit was a central figure in the art of his period, and his sculptures made from bronze, wood, and other materials demonstrate a fusion of Italian idealism with solid German realism.
Educated under Hans Seyfer, Meit knew Albrecht Dürer, who apparently respected his work. He served Frederick the Wise before 1511 and was court sculptor to Margaret of Austria, who gave him most of her commissions. He lived in Antwerp after 1534.
Meit’s small, realistic figures and portraits are especially natural for their time. “Adam and Eve” (first half of the 16th century) reveals the decline in popularity of the historical concept of the Fall; Meit’s subjects, such as “Judith” (1520), are markedly human and contemporary. Meit is perhaps best known for the tombs of the family of Margaret of Austria (1526–31) in Brou, in which he blends Gothic structure with Italianate detail.
