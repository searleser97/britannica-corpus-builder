India ink, also called Chinese Ink,  black pigment in the form of sticks that are moistened before use in drawing and lettering, or the fluid ink consisting of this pigment finely suspended in a liquid medium, such as water, and a glutinous binder. The sticks or cakes consist of specially prepared lampblack, or carbon black, mixed with a gum or glue and sometimes perfume. India ink was used in China and Egypt centuries before the Christian era and is still valued for the opacity and durability that make it one of the finest of inks.
In India, the carbon black from which India ink is produced is obtained by burning bones, tar, pitch, and other substances.
