Daniel Beard, in full Daniel Carter Beard, also called Uncle Dan,  (born June 21, 1850, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—died June 11, 1941, Suffern, New York), American illustrator, author, and outdoor enthusiast who was a pioneer of the youth scouting movement in the United States.
Beard was the son of James Henry Beard, a well-respected painter. He received a degree in civil engineering from Worrall’s Academy in Covington, Kentucky (1869), and worked as an engineer and a surveyor in the Cincinnati area. In the 1870s Beard moved to New York City, where he studied at the Art Students’ League and began working as an illustrator. His work appeared in such publications as Harper’s Weekly and The New York Herald, and he illustrated a number of books, including Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court (1889) and Tom Sawyer Abroad (1894).
Beard’s interest in outdoor activities led him to write The American Boys’ Handy Book (1882), which served as an instruction manual for a broad range of amusements suitable for young boys. In 1905 Beard became an editor of the magazine Recreation, and, to help promote the magazine, he founded the Sons of Daniel Boone, an organization that fostered outdoor recreation among boys. The Sons of Daniel Boone later became the Boy Pioneers of America, and in 1910 it was incorporated, along with other similar scouting groups, into the Boy Scouts of America. Beard served as the organization’s first national commissioner and was active in youth scouting until his death. He was the author of more than 20 books on various aspects of scouting and served as an associate editor of Boys’ Life magazine. His autobiography, Hardly a Man Is Now Alive, was published in 1939.
