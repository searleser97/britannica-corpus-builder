Rodolphe Bresdin,  (born August 13, 1822, Le Fresne, France—died January 11, 1885, Sèvres), eccentric and visionary French engraver, lithographer, and etcher noted for his highly detailed and technically precise prints and drawings. Many of his works had elements of the fantastic, the exotic, or the macabre. He pioneered in lithography, producing such unusual works as Comedy of Death, which inspired similar works by other lithographers. Bresdin’s work was admired by such contemporaries as Victor Hugo, Théophile Gautier, and Charles Baudelaire.
Little is known of Bresdin’s early life. When the Revolution of 1848 broke out, however, he was living in Paris and decided to take an extended walking tour of France. He stayed in Toulouse from 1853 to 1857 and in Bordeaux from 1860 to 1861, where he produced one of his most famous lithographs, The Good Samaritan. Further wanderings included an extended stay in Canada in the early 1870s, after which he returned penniless to France (1876). He remained a solitary figure, working outside of any school, misunderstood and mostly unappreciated. The strange, bizarre imagery of his more than 200 prints, however, was a powerful influence on the Symbolists and the Surrealists of the 20th century.
