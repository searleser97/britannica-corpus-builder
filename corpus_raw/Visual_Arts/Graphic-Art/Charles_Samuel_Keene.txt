Charles Samuel Keene,  (born Aug. 10, 1823, Hornsey, Middlesex, Eng.—died  Jan. 4, 1891, London), English artist and illustrator who was associated with the periodical Punch from 1851 until 1890. His brief and uncluttered illustrations feature gently satirized characters drawn from lower- and middle-class life.
Apprenticed to a wood engraver from 1842 to 1847, Keene made his first appearance in Punch in 1851 and, after nine years of steady work, joined the permanent staff. His services were requisitioned for launching Once a Week in 1859; his most notable work in this periodical was a series of illustrations to Charles Reade’s A Good Fight (afterward rechristened The Cloister and the Hearth) and to George Meredith’s Evan Harrington. In 1872 Keene met Joseph Crawhall, who had been in the habit for years of jotting down any humorous incidents he might hear of or observe and illustrating them for his own amusement. These were placed at Keene’s disposal and inspired at least 250 successful drawings in the last 20 years of his connection with Punch. In 1881 a volume of his Punch drawings was published as Our People.
