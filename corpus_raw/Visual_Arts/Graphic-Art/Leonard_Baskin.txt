Leonard Baskin,  (born August 15, 1922, New Brunswick, New Jersey, U.S.—died June 3, 2000, Northampton, Massachusetts), American sculptor, illustrator, and printmaker noted for his impressive though bleak portrayals of the human figure.
Baskin, who decided at age 14 to become a sculptor, studied at New York University’s School of Architecture and Allied Arts and at Yale University, where he also developed an interest in printing. In 1942 he founded Gehenna Press, which published finely illustrated books—most notably, editions by poets Ted Hughes and Anthony Hecht that featured Baskin’s art. During World War II Baskin served in the U.S. Navy, and, after a stint with the merchant marine, he returned to New York, where he attended the New School for Social Research (B.A., 1949; now The New School). Baskin also studied in Paris and Florence and was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 1953. He later taught at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts (1953–74), and at Hampshire College in Amherst (1984–94).
Inspired by ancient Egyptian and Greek art, Baskin designed monumental figures and reliefs in bronze, limestone, and wood. Among his subjects were poets (Blake, 1955; Barlach Dead, 1959), universal symbols (Hanged Man, 1956; Man with Owl, 1960), and biblical subjects (Prodigal Son, 1976; Ruth and Naomi, 1978). Baskin imbued his sculptures of the human figure with those qualities of spiritual death, decay, and vulnerability which to him were the condition of the 20th-century individual. His sculptures nevertheless possess a kind of forbidding authority. Baskin was particularly noted for his memorials, including the Holocaust Memorial (dedicated 1994) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which features a 7-foot (2.1-metre) figure, seated and in anguish with a hand raised above the head. In his woodcuts Baskin developed a distinctively wiry and nervous linearity. Man of Peace (1952) and Everyman (1960) are among his best-known woodcuts.
Among his numerous honours, Baskin was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1963, and in 1969 he received that academy’s Gold Medal. He also was awarded the Sculpture (1988) and Gold (1989) medals of the National Academy of Design. In addition, Hosie’s Alphabet (1972), which he illustrated and cowrote, was named a Caldecott Honor Book.
