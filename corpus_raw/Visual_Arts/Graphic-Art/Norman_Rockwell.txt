Norman Rockwell,  (born February 3, 1894, New York City, New York, U.S.—died November 8, 1978, Stockbridge, Massachusetts), American illustrator best known for his covers for the journal The Saturday Evening Post.
Rockwell, a scholarship winner of the Art Students League, received his first freelance assignment from Condé Nast at age 17 and thereafter provided illustrations for various magazines. In 1916 he sold his first cover to The Saturday Evening Post, for which in the next 47 years he illustrated a total of 322 magazine covers. From 1926 to 1976 Rockwell also illustrated the official Boy Scout Calendar. During World War II, posters of his paintings portraying the “Four Freedoms” were reproduced and distributed by the Office of War Information.
Rockwell was a careful craftsman with an ability to represent detail realistically. The subjects of most of his illustrations were taken from everyday family and small-town life and were often treated with a touch of humour. Though loved by the public, Rockwell’s work was dismissed by most critics as lacking artistic merit and authentic social observation. In 1977 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom—the nation’s highest peacetime award—by Pres. Gerald Ford.
