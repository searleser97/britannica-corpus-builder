Contour drawing,   version of outline drawing, in which the artist, looking closely at the contour of an object, transfers it in one continuous line to paper without looking down to see what he is doing, except when he needs to place an internal feature such as an eye. The use of the word contour suggests that more emphasis is given to rendering mass and volume than in an outline drawing, and indeed in such works the tactile values are given as much importance as the purely visual ones. As a method of teaching art, contour drawing was popularized by Kimon Nicola√Ødes in The Natural Way to Draw (1941).
