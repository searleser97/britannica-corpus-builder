Monotype,  in printmaking, a technique that generally yields only one good impression from each prepared plate. Monotypes are prized because of their unique textural qualities. They are made by drawing on glass or a plate of smooth metal or stone with a greasy substance such as printer’s ink or oil paint. Then the drawing is pressed by hand onto a sheet of absorbent paper or is printed on an etching press. The pigment remaining on the plate is usually insufficient to make another print unless the original design is reinforced. Further, any subsequent prints will invariably differ from the first one, because variations in repainting and printing are inevitable. Since each is unique and hand executed, monotypes cannot be considered a technique of multiple replication. But, because they are prints on paper, they are usually classed with printmaking media.
One of the earliest artists to explore the technique was Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione (c. 1610–65), who made monotypes from copper etching plates. In the 19th century the English poet and artist William Blake and the French artist Edgar Degas experimented with the technique.
