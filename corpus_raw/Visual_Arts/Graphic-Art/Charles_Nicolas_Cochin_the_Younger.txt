Charles-Nicolas Cochin, the Younger,  (born Feb. 22, 1715, Paris, Fr.—died  April 29, 1790, Paris), outstanding French engraver of the 18th century.
The son of Charles-Nicolas the Elder (1688–1754), from whom he learned engraving, Cochin rose to national prominence early in his career. As a member of the academy (admitted in 1751) and the keeper of the king’s drawings (a post he was given in 1752), he was officially enabled to exert his influence on the artistic taste of his day. Among his more famous works are the illustrations for La Fontaine’s Fables, the engravings of the fetes staged by Louis XV, and his numerous engraved vignettes and portraits.
