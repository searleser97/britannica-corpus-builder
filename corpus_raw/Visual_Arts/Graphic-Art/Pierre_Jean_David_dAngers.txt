Pierre-Jean David d’Angers,  (born March 12, 1789, Angers, France—died  Jan. 4, 1856, Paris), French sculptor, who sought to honour the heroes of modern times by means of an expressive form that could appeal to and inspire a broad public.
David, the son of a carver, went to Paris as a teenager with 11 francs in his pocket to study at the École des Beaux-Arts under Philippe-Laurent Roland. After struggling financially for a year and a half, he received a small annuity from the municipality of Angers. In 1811 he won the Prix de Rome and, during his years of study in Rome, established his mission to devote his art to human grandeur. Returning to Paris in 1816 after a short visit to London, he received many important commissions. One of his first works in Paris, the Condé (lost; model at the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Angers), showed his new tendency toward a dramatic realist approach. In 1827 he visited England, and in 1828 and 1834 he visited Germany. Always a liberal in politics, he had to leave France for a short period after the coup d’état of December 1851.
Many of the most famous men and women of his time sat for David for busts or medallions. A nearly complete collection, originals or copies, is in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Angers. Among David’s most important works are the pediment of the Panthéon, showing the key liberal figures in France since the 18th century grouped round a figure of La Patrie; the Gutenberg monument at Strasbourg; the monument to General Gobert in the Père-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris; the Philopoemen in the Louvre; and the bust of Goethe, presented by him to the poet in 1831, in the public library at Weimar, Ger.
