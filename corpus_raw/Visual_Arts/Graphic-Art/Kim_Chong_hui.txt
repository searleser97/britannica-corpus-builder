Kim Chŏng-hui, also called Ch’u-sa, or Wan-dang,  (born 1786, Kyŏngho-ri, Korea [now in South Korea]—died  1856, Pukch’ŏng [now in North Korea]), the best-known Korean calligrapher of the 19th century.
Kim was born into a family of artists and government officials. As a young man he accompanied his father on a trip to Peking, where he became friendly with many of the leading Chinese scholars of the day. Returning to Korea, he became a high government official, holding many positions. Meanwhile, he continued to improve his artistic talents. From the famous li shu calligraphy of Han China, Kim developed a unique style known as the ch’usa, which has continued to be one of the major calligraphic styles in Korea.
In 1840 Kim was implicated in a plot against the Korean monarch and exiled to the southern island of Cheju. Hundreds of students and admirers flocked to join him, but in 1851 he was exiled again, this time to the cold northern island of Pukch’ŏng, where he died.
