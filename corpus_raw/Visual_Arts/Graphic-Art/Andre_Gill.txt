André Gill, original name Louis-andré Gosset,  (born October 1840, Paris, Fr.—died  1885, Charenton), French caricaturist who used a style of enlarged heads dwarfing undersized bodies, often copied by later cartoonists.
After studying at the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris, Gill pursued a career as an illustrator, becoming famous for portrait caricatures of his illustrious contemporaries, e.g., Sarah Bernhardt and Richard Wagner. His successful career was brought to an untimely end about 1880 by mental illness.
