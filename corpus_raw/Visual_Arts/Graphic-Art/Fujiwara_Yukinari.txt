Fujiwara Yukinari,   (born 972, Japan—died  Jan. 3, 1028, Japan), Japanese calligrapher, known as one of the Sanseki (“Three Brush Traces”), in effect the finest calligraphers of the age. The others were Ono Tōfū and Fujiwara Sukemasa, and the three perfected the style of writing called jōdai-yō (“ancient style”).
Yukinari was the son of a courtier. After the death of his father he was raised by his grandfather, Prince Kanenori. He held a succession of high government offices. His extant calligraphic works include his versions of Wakan rōei shū (“Collection of Japanese and Chinese Poems to be Sung”) and of the anthology of Chinese poet Po Chü-i, Haku Rakuten shikan (“Poetry Volume of Haku Rakuten”). In addition, he wrote Gonki (“Diary of Gon”), his diary.
