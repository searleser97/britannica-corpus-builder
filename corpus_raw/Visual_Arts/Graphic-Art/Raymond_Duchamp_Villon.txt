Raymond Duchamp-Villon, original name Raymond Duchamp,  (born November 5, 1876, Paris, France—died October 7, 1918, Cannes), French sculptor who was one of the first major modern artists to apply the principles of Cubism to sculpture.
In 1900 Duchamp-Villon gave up medical school for sculpture, often working closely with his brothers, the artists Gaston (better known by his pseudonym, Jacques Villon) and Marcel Duchamp. Duchamp-Villon’s early work was influenced by Auguste Rodin’s figurative sculpture, but he converted to a Cubist style in 1910. His progression to more simplified forms can be seen in the portrait heads Baudelaire (1911) and Maggy (1911), which were virtually reduced to simple geometric shapes. With works such as Seated Woman (1914), Duchamp-Villon increasingly employed the Cubist painters’ technique of dissecting an object into abstract shapes.
Duchamp-Villon’s move toward abstraction was fully achieved in his masterpiece, Horse (1914), which reduces forms to their geometric essentials and integrates space into the mass of the work. This sculpture is also notable for its dynamic depiction of mechanical motion, a central theme of the Futurists. Duchamp-Villon began to apply Cubist principles to architecture, but he was killed in World War I before his experiments could be realized.
