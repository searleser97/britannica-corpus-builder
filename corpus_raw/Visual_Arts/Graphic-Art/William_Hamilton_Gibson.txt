William Hamilton Gibson,  (born October 5, 1850, Sandy Hook, Connecticut, U.S.—died July 16, 1896, Washington, Connecticut), American illustrator, author, and naturalist whose well-received images reached a large audience through the popular magazines of his day.
As a child, Gibson sketched flowers and insects, developed an interest in botany and entomology, and acquired great skill in making wax flowers. His first drawings were published in 1870 and were of a technical character. He rapidly became an expert illustrator and a remarkably able wood engraver, while also practicing lithography with great success. He drew for many periodicals, his most popular works being a long series of illustrations for nature articles published in Harper’s Weekly, Scribner’s Monthly, and Century. Gibson was also an expert photographer: his drawings reflect this knowledge in their nearly photographic and almost microscopic accuracy of detail. In 1893, three years before his death, Gibson made drawings of the buildings and landscape of the grounds at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, which were used for an article in Scribner’s entitled “Foreground and Vista at the Fair.”
