Ibn al-Bawwāb, in full Abū Al-ḥasan ʿalī Ibn Hilāl Ibn Al-bawwāb,  also called Ibn As-sitrī,  (born  10th century, Iraq—died  1022 or 1031, Baghdad), Arabic calligrapher of the ʿAbbāsid Age (750–1258) who reputedly invented the cursive rayḥānī and muḥaqqaq scripts. He refined several of the calligraphic styles invented a century earlier by Ibn Muqlah, including the naskhī and tawqī scripts, and collected and preserved for his students numerous original manuscripts of that master.
Ibn al-Bawwāb was from a poor family: the name he is known by means literally “son of the doorkeeper.” Nevertheless, he received a thorough education in law and is said to have known the Qurʾān by heart. Ibn al-Bawwāb’s interest in calligraphy was inspired by Muḥammad ibn Asad and was developed under Muḥammad ibn Samsamānī, both of whom were students of Ibn Muqlah. Altogether, Ibn al-Bawwāb reputedly produced 64 copies of the Qurʾān by hand. One of the most beautiful in the rayḥānī script is in the Laleli Mosque in Istanbul, a gift of the Ottoman Sultan Selim I (1470–1512). Ibn al-Bawwāb was recognized as a master in his own time; his school of calligraphy lasted until Baghdad fell to the Mongol invaders more than two centuries after his death.
