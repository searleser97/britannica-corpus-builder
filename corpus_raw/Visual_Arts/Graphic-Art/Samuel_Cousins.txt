Samuel Cousins,  (born May 9, 1801, Exeter, Devon, England—died May 7, 1887, London), English mezzotint engraver, preeminently the interpreter of the painter Sir Thomas Lawrence.
During his apprenticeship Cousins engraved many of the best among the 360 little mezzotints illustrating the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds. In the finest of his transcripts of Lawrence, such as Master Lambton (1826), the brilliance and force of effect in a high key corresponded exactly with qualities achieved by the painter. After the introduction of steel for engraving about 1823, Cousins and his contemporaries were compelled to use it: the soft copper employed for mezzotint plates did not yield enough fine impressions to be commercially competitive with line engraving. Because of the hardness of steel, the paintinglike quality of mezzotints of the 18th century was wanting in Cousins’s later works. The labour of scraping steel was so augmented that Cousins resorted to using stipple engraving and etching processes. To this mixed style he added heavy roulette (toothed wheel) and rocking-tool textures. The effect of these prints was mechanical, but their phenomenal popularity kept alive a form of mezzotint during a critical phase of its history.
