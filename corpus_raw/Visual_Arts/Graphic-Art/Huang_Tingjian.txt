Huang Tingjian, Wade-Giles romanization Huang T’ing-chien, courtesy name (zi) Luzhi, literary name (hao) Shangu Daoren (Chinese: “The Daoist Shangu”),  (born 1045, Fengning [now Xiushui], Jiangxi province, China—died 1105, Yizhou [now Yishan], Guangxi), Chinese poet and calligrapher esteemed as the founder of the Jiangxi school of poetry.
Born into a family of poets, Huang Tingjian was educated in the Confucian classics, history, and literature, and he received the jinshi (“advanced scholar”) degree in 1067. He passed the qualifying examination in 1072 and became an instructor at the Imperial Academy in Beijing. He was later appointed magistrate in various counties before being assigned in 1085 to participate in the compilation of the annals of the reign of the Song dynasty emperor Shenzong. In 1095, however, having been accused of inaccuracy and calumny in the compilation, Huang Tingjian was demoted; he subsequently lived in exile for some 20 years.
Huang Tingjian and Su Dongpo are frequently mentioned together (sometimes as Su-Huang). These two poets are also frequently grouped with Mi Fu and Cai Xiang as the Four Great Song Calligraphers. Huang Tingjian was a more scholarly and introverted person than Su Dongpo, and his approach to creativity was more mystical. His wild cursive script was derived from the 8th-century Tang-dynasty priest Huaisu. Huang Tingjian’s unconventional approach to poetry was influential; rather than adopting the flowery, clever, and extravagant style typical of the late Tang and early Song period, Huang Tingjian advocated an introspective, carefully constructed poetry that rejected established patterns. His influence was felt into the 20th century.
