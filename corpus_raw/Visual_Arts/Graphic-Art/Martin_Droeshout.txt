Martin Droeshout,  (born 1560s, Brussels [Belgium]—died c. 1642, London, England), Flemish-born English engraver, primarily remembered for his engraved portrait of William Shakespeare, which appeared in the First Folio edition of Shakespeare’s plays (1623).
Droeshout and his parents moved to London as Protestant refugees around 1569. Like his father before him—and possibly by patrimony—Martin became a freeman of the painter-stainers’ company, and his stature there helped earn him the commission for the First Folio portrait engraving. (This Shakespeare portrait is often erroneously attributed to one of Droeshout’s nephews, also named Martin; however, the younger Droeshout was only 15 at the time of Shakespeare’s death and was unlikely to have been chosen for such an important commission.) The Shakespeare engraving was eulogized by Ben Jonson and called true to life.
