E. Simms Campbell, in full Elmer Simms Campbell,  (born Jan. 2, 1906, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.â€”died  Jan. 27, 1971, White Plains, N.Y.), first black American cartoonist to publish his work in general-circulation magazines on a regular basis.
Campbell won a nationwide contest in cartooning while still attending high school. He later studied at the University of Chicago and the Art Institute of Chicago. He then worked as a railroad dining-car waiter, amusing himself by drawing caricatures of the passengers, one of whom liked his work and gave him a job in a commercial-art studio in St. Louis.
Campbell later moved to New York City, where he gradually established himself as a regular contributor to various humour magazines while working for an advertising agency. In 1933 the magazine Esquire was established, and Campbell became its foremost cartoonist, with as many as a dozen drawings in an issue. His work was also published in Cosmopolitan, The New Yorker, and Playboy. He is best known for his representations of voluptuous women, frequently in a harem setting.
