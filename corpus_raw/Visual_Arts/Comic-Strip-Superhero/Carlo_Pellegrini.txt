Carlo Pellegrini, pseudonym Ape,  (born March 1839, Capua, Kingdom of Naples [Italy]—died  Jan. 22, 1889, London, Eng.), caricaturist notable for his portraits of prominent Englishmen appearing in Vanity Fair.
As a young man, he was a part of Neapolitan society, whose members he caricatured in a good-natured way. Following an unhappy love affair and the death of a sister, he went to England in 1864 and turned his hand to cartooning. His first effort—a cartoon of Benjamin Disraeli—appeared in the British literary magazine Vanity Fair in 1869, shortly before he adopted the signature “Ape.” His second, of William Gladstone, appeared a week later. One of the best known is of the writer Thomas Carlyle, which appeared in 1870. His portraits were gently humorous, in keeping with his genial disposition.
