Mark Boxer, in full Charles Mark Edward Boxer,  pseudonym Marc,  (born May 19, 1931, Eng.—died  July 20, 1988, London), British magazine and newspaper editor and cartoonist who was known for his political and social caricatures and single-frame “pocket cartoons” that often satirized the British upper-middle class.
Boxer was briefly expelled from King’s College, Cambridge, when he published an irreverent poem in the student magazine Granta, of which he was editor (1953). Soon after the incident, he quit Cambridge to study layout and design at a London fashion magazine and to draw cartoons for The Tatler. After working as art director of Queen (1957–61), he joined the editorial staff of The Sunday Times, where he served as director (1964–66) and assistant editor (1966–79). His cartoons, many of which featured the trendy social-climbing couple the Stringalongs, appeared daily in The Times (1969–83), The Guardian (1983–86), and The Daily Telegraph (1986–88). In 1972 he was named Cartoonist of the Year. Boxer was hired by Condé Nast Publications as editor of the The Tatler (1983), and in 1987 he was promoted to editor in chief of Vogue and editorial director of Condé Nast.
