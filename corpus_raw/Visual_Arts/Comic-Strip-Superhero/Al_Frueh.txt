Al Frueh, byname of Alfred Frueh,  (born 1880, Lima, Ohio, U.S.—died  Sept. 14, 1968, Sharon, Conn.), American cartoonist and caricaturist for The New Yorker magazine from 1925 to 1962.
Reared variously to be a farmer and then a brewer and also studying at a business school in his home town (learning shorthand), Frueh turned to cartooning professionally after being hired by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch (1904–08) in its art department. After a trip to Europe in 1909, he worked for the New York World (1910–12, 1914–25) and then, in 1925, contributed two cartoons for the very first issue of The New Yorker and then the cover cartoon for its second issue. He remained a contributor to The New Yorker until the age of 82, producing chiefly caricatures of the Broadway theatre scene.
