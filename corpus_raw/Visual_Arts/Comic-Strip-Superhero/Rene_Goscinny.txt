René Goscinny,  (born Aug. 4, 1926, Paris—died  Nov. 5, 1977, Paris), French writer who is best known for the comic strip “Astérix”, which he created with illustrator Albert Uderzo.
Goscinny was reared and educated in Buenos Aires and later worked on children’s books in New York City. In 1954 he returned to Paris to direct a press agency and soon became a writer for the “Lucky Luke” comic strip. In 1957 he met Uderzo, a cartoonist, and collaborated with him on the short-lived “Benjamin et Benjamine” and, a year later, on the somewhat more successful “Oumpah-Pah le Peau-Rouge” (“Oumpah-Pah the Redskin”).
In 1959 Goscinny founded the French humour magazine Pilote, and at the same time, in collaboration with Uderzo, began publishing “Astérix le Gaulois,” a comic strip that concerned itself with the adventures of a diminutive Gallic tribesman at the time of Caesar’s conquest of Gaul. The title character, Astérix, and his friend Obélix belonged to the only unconquered tribe, the “Invincible Gauls.” The Romans they opposed were generally made to look stupid and clumsy. Coinciding as it did with Charles de Gaulle’s rise to power in France, the strip reflected certain political sentiments that were widespread at the time. “Astérix le Gaulois” became widely popular and brought substantial success to both Goscinny and Uderzo. Goscinny was the scriptwriter of several other French comic strips, including “Les Dingodossiers” (1965–67), with Marcel Gotlib, and also was a principal in a French publishing firm. He was made a Chevalier of Arts and Letters in 1967. The “Astérix” strip was translated into 15 languages, and after its appearance in book form (1959) it sold more than 18,000,000 copies worldwide.
