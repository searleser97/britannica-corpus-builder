R.K. Laxman, in full Rasipuram Krishnaswami Laxman,  (born October 24, 1921, Mysore [now Mysuru], India—died January 26, 2015, Pune), Indian cartoonist who created the daily comic strip You Said It, which chronicled Indian life and politics through the eyes of the “common man,” a bulbous-nosed bespectacled observer dressed in a dhoti and a distinctive checked coat who served as a silent point-of-view character for readers.
Laxman was the youngest of seven siblings, and he developed an affinity for drawing at an early age. While at Maharaja’s College in Mysore, he illustrated stories by his novelist brother, R.K. Narayan, in The Hindu newspaper. He subsequently turned to creating political cartoons for local newspapers. He worked at The Free Press Journal in Mumbai (Bombay) with Bal Thackeray, who was a cartoonist before founding the Shiv Sena political party. In 1951 Laxman moved to The Times of India, where he created You Said It, which adorned the newspaper’s front page into the 21st century. Laxman’s “common man” was witty and sarcastic but never venomous, and his outlook was said to represent that of countless average Indians. The comic strip also served as the basis for a comedy series on Indian TV, R.K. Laxman Ki Duniya (2011–13).
Laxman published numerous short stories, essays, and travel articles, some of which were collected in The Distorted Mirror (2003). He also wrote the novels The Hotel Riviera (1988) and The Messenger (1993) and an autobiography, The Tunnel of Time (1998). In addition, numerous collections of Laxman’s cartoons were published. In 2005 he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India’s second highest civilian honour.
