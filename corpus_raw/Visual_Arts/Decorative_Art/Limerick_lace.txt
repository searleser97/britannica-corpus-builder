Limerick lace,   strictly speaking not lace at all but embroidered machine-made net the appearance of which approximates true lace. It was made at Mount Kennet, near Limerick, in Ireland, having been introduced there by an English lace manufacturer in 1829. Designs similar to those of contemporary lace were embroidered in tambour stitch (a form of chain stitch) and in needlerun stitches, versions of needlepoint filling stitches. The word Limerick is sometimes used loosely to refer to embroidered net in general.
