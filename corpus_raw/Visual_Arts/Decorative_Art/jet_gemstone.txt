Jet,  a dense, fine-grained, compact variety of subbituminous coal, or lignite. It is coal-black in colour and has a hardness of 2+ and a specific gravity of 1.1 to 1.4.
Unlike lignite, it is not laminated and so has little tendency to split but breaks with a conchoidal fracture. It can be worked readily on a lathe and takes a high glossy polish. Used for ornaments and buttons, jet has been found in Bronze Age burial sites in Britain. It occurs near Whitby, Yorkshire, and was originally found as nodular or lenticular masses that had weathered out of the hard shales and were found in streams and along the Yorkshire coast. Later, small mines in the shale were opened to enlarge the supply. Similar material has been found in other coal formations.
From prehistoric times until the early 20th century, jet was a popular item in English jewelry. It enjoyed considerable vogue as jewelry suitable to wear during mourning. Because of its softness it scratches readily. It was supplanted by the harder chalcedony, which can be dyed a deep black colour. With the advent of coloured plastics, which are easily cut in any form, jet is now seen only in antique jewelry and in museums. It still has considerable importance to archaeologists but is no longer worn as jewelry.
