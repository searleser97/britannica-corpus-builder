Raised work, also called Stump Work,  form of embroidery practiced in England in the 17th century, characterized by biblical and mythological scenes of padded plants, animals, birds, and the like in high relief. Panels, which were used as pictures or decorative coverings for mirror frames, caskets, and so on, were ornamented with padded flowers, fruit, and human figures, sometimes with details such as hands in wax.
The technique developed naturally from Elizabethan embroidery, in which petals or leaves, for example, were occasionally made to stand out by means of detached buttonhole stitches. It reached the epitome of exuberance before disappearing about 1766.
