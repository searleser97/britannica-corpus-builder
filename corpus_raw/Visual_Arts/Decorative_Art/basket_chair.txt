Basket chair,  chair made from plaited twigs, or osiers, shaped on a warp of stiff rods. Basketmaking is one of the oldest crafts, and basket chairs are known to date back at least as far as Roman times. An early 3rd-century-ad stone relief in the Trier Museum, Germany, shows a woman at her toilet seated in a basket chair that curves to fit the body. Similar chairs were still being made in the 20th century.
They achieved great popularity in Victorian times; padded with cushions or buttoned upholstery, they were used in both house and garden.
