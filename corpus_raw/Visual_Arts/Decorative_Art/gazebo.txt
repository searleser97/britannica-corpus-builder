Gazebo,   lookout or belvedere in the form of a turret, cupola, or garden house set on a height to give an extensive view. The name is an 18th-century joke word combining “gaze” with the Latin suffix ebo, meaning “I shall.” As a structured form, it is as old as garden history: it is the “viewing pavilion” of the Chinese or the summerhouse on the summit of a garden mount referred to by the 17th-century philosopher Francis Bacon.
The name should be applied not to any garden house but only to those with extensive views, perhaps only those with views in all directions. Few late 18th- or 19th-century “rustic” gazebos survive, but 17th-century turrets built up in an angle of the garden wall to give a prospect are not uncommon.
