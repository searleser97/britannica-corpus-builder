Paris ware,   faience (tin-glazed earthenware) and porcelain ware produced in the Paris region from the 16th century. The hard-paste–porcelain industry in Paris owed its existence to a breach in the Sèvres porcelain monopoly after 1766. The major factories were under the protection or ownership of high-ranking noblemen, just as Sèvres was under that of the king. They are known by the names of those protectors and of the streets on which they were situated. The Clignancourt factory of Monsieur (Louis-Stanislas-Xavier, Count of Provence, later Louis XVIII) was the most important after Sèvres; it was opened in 1771. The factory of the Duke d’Angoulême, rue de Bondy, was also among the better known. Its ceramics enjoyed an especially high reputation during the First Empire. The Duke de Berry’s factory in rue Fontaine-au-Roy was active from 1771 to 1841. In general, all Paris porcelain is rather more transparent than Sèvres, and its paste is of an unusual whiteness.
