Pinxton porcelain,   English porcelain produced in Derbyshire from 1796 to 1813. The factory was established by John Coke, who had lived in Dresden, Saxony, with the help of William Billingsley, who had worked as a painter at Derby. Billingsley remained at Pinxton until 1799, concentrating on the production of the porcelain rather than its decoration. He made a ware that contained bone ash, was granular yet transparent, and had a brilliant glaze. He had probably obtained the formula from the Chelsea painter Zachariah Boreman. Pinxton produced only domestic ware and tableware. In 1804 the factory was taken over by John Cutts; the wares produced thereafter were inferior to those of Billingsley.
