Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld,  (born March 26, 1794, Leipzig, Saxony [Germany]—died May 24, 1872, Dresden, Germany), painter and designer who figured importantly in the German Nazarene movement.
Schnorr received his earliest instruction from his father, Hans Veit Schnorr, a draftsman, engraver, and painter, and in 1818 he went to Rome where he was associated with a group of painters who called themselves the Nazarenes, or Lucas Brotherhood (Lukasbund). Inspired by early Renaissance art and the works of Albrecht Dürer, Schnorr’s oil paintings were characterized by a precise linearity, clear bright colours, and a multiplicity of symbolic detail. He shared his fellow Nazarenes’ interest in a revival of fresco painting and the creation of a “monumental art.” Together with Johann Overbeck, Peter von Cornelius, and Philipp Veit, Schnorr received a commission to decorate the entrance hall of the Villa Massimo with frescoes after Ludovico Ariosto.
Schnorr left Rome and settled in Munich in 1827, where he served King Ludwig I, transplanting to Germany the art of wall painting learned in Italy. For his Picture Bible (1852–60), an English commission arising out of a visit to London in 1851, he designed over 200 woodcuts. He also designed the windows, manufactured at the royal factory at Munich, for St. Paul’s Cathedral, London.
