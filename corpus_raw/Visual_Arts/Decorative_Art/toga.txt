Toga,  characteristic loose, draped outer garment of Roman citizens. Adopted by the Romans from the Etruscans, it was originally worn by both sexes of all classes but was gradually abandoned by women, then by labouring people, and finally by the patricians themselves. Throughout the history of the empire, however, it remained the state dress, the garment of the emperor and high officials. Made from an oval-shaped piece of material, the toga had voluminous folds, requiring such skill to drape that often a special slave was retained for this operation. Because the mass of folds prevented active pursuits, the toga became the distinctive garment of the upper classes.
Colour and pattern were rigidly prescribed for most wearers. For example, senators and candidates wore white togas (toga candida); freeborn boys, until puberty, wore a purple-bordered toga (toga praetexta); after reaching puberty, adolescents began to wear the plain manâ€™s toga (toga pura, or toga virilis); people in mourning wore dark colours (toga pulla); and for triumphs and, in the later period, as worn by consuls, the toga was richly embroidered and patterned (toga picta). After about 100 ce the toga began to diminish in length.
