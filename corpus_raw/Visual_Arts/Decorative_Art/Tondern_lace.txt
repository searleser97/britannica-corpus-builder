Tondern lace,   lace made at Tønder (German: Tondern), Den., in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Bobbin-made laces with flower designs similar to those of Mechlin lace were made. No original style was initiated at Tønder. The lace, however, was popular in England and was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851.
