Lowboy,  antiquarian term for a small dressing table with four or six legs and two or three drawers, resembling in some ways the lower portion of a highboy (q.v.). Lowboy and highboy were often made to match. In the versions made until about 1750, the legs are joined by stretchers, but after that date they usually assume a cabriole shape.
