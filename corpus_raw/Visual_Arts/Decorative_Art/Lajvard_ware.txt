Lājvard ware, also called Lajvardina Ware,   type of vase from Kāshān, Iran, mentioned in Abū al-Qāsim’s treatise on ceramics (1301). Vases were executed in simple red, white, black, and gold leaf designs on a turquoise or dark blue matte glaze. The designs were almost exclusively abstract and floral. Lājvard (Persian: “lapis lazuli,” referring to the blue glaze used) may date from the late 12th century; output increased about the mid-14th century.
