Labarum,  sacred military standard of the Christian Roman emperors, first used by Constantine I in the early part of the 4th century ad. The labarum—a Christian version of the vexillum, the military standard used earlier in the Roman Empire—incorporated the Chi-Rho, the monogram of Christ, in a golden wreath atop the staff. The flag was made of purple silk (purple dye being at this time a rarity derived from a shellfish of the genus Murex) richly embroidered with gold. Although usually suspended from a horizontal bar, it appears to have been displayed occasionally by fastening one of its sides to its staff. In the Middle Ages the pastoral staff of a bishop often had attached to it a small purple scarf known as the vexillum, supposedly derived from the labarum.
According to the 4th-century historian Eusebius, in his Life of Constantine, before the victory over Maxentius (312), Constantine saw a sign of the cross in the sky and the words “in this sign thou shalt conquer” and used it as a talisman in battle. Dating of the labarum is attested by coins issued at Constantinople (now Istanbul) after Constantine’s victory over Licinius in 324.
