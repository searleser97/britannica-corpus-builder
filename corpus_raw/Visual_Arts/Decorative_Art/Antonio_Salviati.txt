Antonio Salviati,  (born March 18, 1816, Vicenza, Venetia, Austrian Empire [now in Italy]—died  Jan. 25, 1890, Venice, Italy), Italian glass manufacturer who helped reestablish Murano as a centre of Italian glassworking and was instrumental in stimulating European interest in brightly coloured, ornate pieces of Italian glass.
Murano had been a glassmaking centre since the European Middle Ages, but in the 19th century the industry was revitalized by Salviati and others who adapted traditional skills to modern manufacturing processes. Salviati’s firm helped promote glass as an accessible art form and encouraged the public to collect glass ornaments and tableware.
A lawyer by profession, Salviati became involved in restoration work being done on the mosaics of Venice’s St. Mark’s Cathedral. His interest in mosaics led to an interest in glass and, ultimately, in glassmaking. He established his first business in 1859 with a partner, Lorenzo Radi, and within a few years began receiving major commissions from abroad—his firm made the mosaic glass for the altar screen of the high altar of Westminster Abbey. In about 1876 he left his business partners and established a new firm.
Salviati was the first modern Italian factory owner to employ many skilled workers to produce glass in quantity and designed primarily for export. His factory’s designs were seen at exhibitions throughout Europe, and their elaborate ornamentation was popular in the Victorian era. Before Salviati’s time, the production of art glass had been restricted to unique and expensive pieces, available only to the wealthy. By the late 19th century, however, through the efforts of Salviati and other progressive manufacturers, most Victorian parlours possessed at least one piece of colourful glass.
