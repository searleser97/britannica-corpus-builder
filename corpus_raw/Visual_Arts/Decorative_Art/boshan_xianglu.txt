Boshan xianglu, Wade-Giles romanization po-shan hsiang-lu, also called hill censer,  Chinese bronze censer common in the Han dynasty (206 bcâ€“ad 220). Censers (vessels made for burning incense) of this type were made to represent the form of the Bo Mountain (Bo Shan), a mythical land of immortality.
Typically, the censer has a round pedestal base with molded patterns of the sea and sea animals, from which emerges a stem supporting the incense cup. This cup has a pierced cover in the form of the Bo Mountain. It contains several (up to 12) upward-projecting pieces designed to represent vegetation, animals, and immortals. The censer is sometimes ornamented further with inlays of jewels, silver, and gold.
With incense smoke emerging from the holes in the lid, the censer is an abundantly sensuous, fully animated representation of nature. Whether this was the specific meaning and function of the censer is uncertain.
