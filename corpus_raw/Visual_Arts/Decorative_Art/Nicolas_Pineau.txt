Nicolas Pineau,  (born Oct. 8, 1684, Paris—died  April 24, 1754, Paris), French wood-carver and interior designer, a leader in the development of interior decorating in the light, asymmetric, lavishly decorated Rococo style.
After study with the architects François Mansart and Germain Boffrand, Pineau followed his father’s trade. His son, Dominique (1718–86), also became a wood sculptor.
One of a group of French artisans who were visiting the newly established city of St. Petersburg in 1716 at the invitation of Peter the Great, Pineau remained in Russia until about 1728, carving the tsar’s cabinet in the Peterhof palace and also serving as an architect and interior designer. Returning to Paris, he became an important designer, launching the vogue for Rococo rooms in private dwellings.
Pineau’s works are characterized by shallow recesses with rounded corners and ornamentation employing shell motifs, leafy scrolls, and classical busts in medallions. Later interior designers and architects were influenced by his engravings.
