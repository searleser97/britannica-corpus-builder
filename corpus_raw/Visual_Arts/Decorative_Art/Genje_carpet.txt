Genje carpet,  floor covering handwoven in Azerbaijan in or near the city of Gäncä (also spelled Gendje or Gänjä; in the Soviet era it was named Kirovabad, and under Imperial Russia, Yelizavetpol). The carpets are characterized by simple, angular designs and saturated (intense) colours. Genje carpets most often have designs composed of octagons, stars, or three geometric medallions arranged on the carpet’s longitudinal axis. Typical colours are blue, dark blue, and madder red.
Old Genjes are made entirely of wool, but newer examples have piles of coarse wool knotted onto cotton foundation weaves. As the region producing Genje rugs lies between the areas producing Kazakh and Karabagh rugs, the Genje shows features of both.
