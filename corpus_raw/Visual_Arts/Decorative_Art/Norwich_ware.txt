Norwich ware,   delft (tin-glazed) earthenware produced in Norwich, Norfolk, Eng., of which little is known. About 1567 two Flemish potters, Jasper Andries and Jacob Janson, who had moved to Norwich from Antwerp, may have made paving tiles and vessels for apothecaries and others. So far nothing made by them in Norwich has been identified, and they moved to London about 1570. Potting was still active in the town in 1696, but although posset pots and other white ware, as well as a type of puzzle jug often decorated with a tulip on the front, are known, they were probably imported from Delft, Holland, or Antwerp. Some wares of this type have Norfolk place-names.
