Brilliant cut,   method of faceting a diamond to take best advantage of the optical properties of the stone and produce a finished gem with the maximum fire and brilliancy. It is the most popular style of faceting for diamonds. A brilliant-cut stone is round in plan view and has 58 facets, 33 of which are above the girdle (the widest part of the stone) and 25 of which are below. When the stone is cut so that the facets of the crown (above the girdle) make an angle of 35° to the plane of the girdle and those of the pavilion (below the girdle) an angle of 41°, the maximum amount of light entering the crown will be reflected back through the crown by the pavilion, and the diamond will possess its maximum brilliance and a high degree of fire.
Introduced by the Venetian gem-cutter Vicenti Peruzzi at the end of the 17th century, the modern brilliant cut evolved slowly until reaching the present form early in the 20th century. It is also used on such stones as ruby, sapphire, emerald, and zircon.
