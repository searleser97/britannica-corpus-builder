Istoriato style,   style of pottery decoration, originating about 1500 in Faenza, Italy, and popular throughout the 16th century, in which paintings comparable in seriousness to Italian Renaissance easel paintings were applied to maiolica ware. The subjects—biblical, historical, and mythological scenes—are executed with a realism (including the use of perspective) quite unlike any previous pottery decoration. Some examples are almost exact copies, others are free interpretations of the paintings and graphic work of such contemporary artists as Raphael and Albrecht Dürer. Istoriato painting sometimes occupies only the centre of the dish, with a border of formal ornament surrounding it; but often, notably in wares from Urbino, the painting covers the entire surface.
The greatest istoriato painter was Nicola Pellipario, who decorated Castel Durante and Urbino wares. His palette is soft and harmonious, and his subjects, drawn chiefly from Ovid and Lucian, are lyrically rendered. Many pieces of a service produced for Isabella d’Este, and another for the Ridolfis, survive in museums. The istoriato style was widely imitated in pottery centres outside of Italy, especially in France.
