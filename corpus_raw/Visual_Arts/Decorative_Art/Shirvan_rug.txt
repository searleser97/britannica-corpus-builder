Shirvan rug,  floor covering handmade in the Shirvan region of Azerbaijan in the southeastern Caucasus. With the exception of a group of rugs woven in the vicinity of Baku, most Shirvans are found in small sizes, with examples from the southern part of the area around the town of Saliani more likely to be in the long, narrow format described in the West as runners. The area around Maraza has produced many prayer rugs, including a well-known type with boteh (leaf-shaped) figures on a blue field.
Most small Shirvan rugs are not specifically identifiable as to village source, as they share a range of geometric field designs and borders. They are generally less finely woven than rugs from farther north in the Kuba district, although they are finer than the Kazakh-type rugs made in western Azerbaijan. Shirvan rugs are usually all wool, but some may show cotton wefts and cotton edges.
