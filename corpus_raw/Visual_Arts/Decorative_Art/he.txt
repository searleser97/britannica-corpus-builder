He, Wade-Giles romanization ho, also spelled huo,  type of ancient Chinese bronze vessel that was used to heat liquids and to serve wine.
The he has a number of variations in silhouette, and its only unvarying characteristic is a tubular spout projecting prominently from the body. It usually has a domical lid and a vertical handle on the side opposite the spout, and it stands on three or four legs that are well-articulated with the shape of the body.
The form of the he was derived from a Neolithic Period (c. 5000–2000 bc) pottery predecessor, but it was produced mostly during the Shang (18th–12th century bc) and Zhou (c. 1111–256/255 bc) dynasties. The decoration is generally quite imaginative, especially in the early periods, and it often exploits and complements the shape of the he. The he was also sometimes used to pour wine into the ground during special ceremonies.
