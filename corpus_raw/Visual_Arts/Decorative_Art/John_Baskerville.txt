John Baskerville,  (born Jan. 28, 1706, Wolverley, Worcestershire, Eng.—died Jan. 8, 1775, Birmingham, Warwickshire), English printer and creator of a typeface of great distinction bearing his name, whose works are among the finest examples of the art of printing.
Baskerville became a writing master at Birmingham but in 1740 established a japanning (varnishing) business, whose profits enabled him to experiment in typefounding. He set up a printing house and in 1757 published his first work, an edition of Virgil, followed in 1758 by an edition of John Milton. Appointed printer to the University of Cambridge, he undertook an edition of the Bible (1763), which is considered his masterpiece. He published a particularly beautiful edition of Horace in 1762; the success of a second edition (1770) encouraged him to issue a series of editions of Latin authors.
The bold quality of Baskerville’s print derived from his use of a highly glossed paper and a truly black ink that he had invented. His typography was much criticized in England, and after his death his types were purchased by the French dramatist Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais. Their subsequent history is uncertain, but in 1917 the surviving punches and matrices were recognized, and in 1953 they were presented to the University of Cambridge. Baskerville type has been revived, its clarity and balance making it a good type for continuous reading.
