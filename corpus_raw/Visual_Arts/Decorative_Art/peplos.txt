Peplos, also spelled peplus,  garment worn by Greek women during the early Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods (i.e., up to about 300 ce). It consisted of a large rectangular piece of material folded vertically and hung from the shoulders, with a broad overfold. During the early periods, it was belted around the waist, usually beneath the overfold; if the overfold was long, however, the belt was sometimes placed on top of it, as seen in many statues of Athena.
In Hellenistic times the overfold was belted below the bust. To allow for growing, young girls wore peploses with long overfolds. When worn with other types of dress, the peplos was the outermost garment. Initially, it was made of wool or linen; later, cotton and silk were also used.
