Spatterware,   in the United States, American and English pottery of about 1800–50 with patterns either spattered or sponged on. The technique has a wider incidence in pottery history, however, occurring, for instance, in Staffordshire, England, about 1750. About 1800–20 spatterware was made at the Wedgwood factory in England, sometimes specifically for sale in the United States, where it was also made.
