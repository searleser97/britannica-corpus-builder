Cozzi porcelain,   soft-paste porcelain made in Venice by Geminiano Cozzi from about 1764 to 1812. Cozzi products, often freely adapted versions of Meissen porcelain, consisted mainly of figures, vases, and tablewares with Rococo decoration that was frequently distinguished by an imaginative interpretation wholly Italian in style. Rich colours, including red, bluish purple, and emerald green, were characteristic, as was softly toned gilding. Especially noteworthy were dainty white glazed and biscuit figures and groups modeled in miniature. An anchor was the traditional mark.
