Cornucopia, also called Horn Of Plenty,  decorative motif, dating from ancient Greece, that symbolizes abundance. The motif originated as a curved goat’s horn filled to overflowing with fruit and grain. It is emblematic of the horn possessed by Zeus’s nurse, the Greek nymph Amalthaea (q.v.), which could be filled with whatever the owner wished.
