Saint-Cloud porcelain,   soft-paste porcelain made in the town of Saint-Cloud, Fr., from the last quarter of the 17th century until 1766. Pierre Chicaneau began the manufacture, which passed by marriage to the family of Henri Trou (c. 1722 onward). Much of the porcelain, which was yellowish or creamy off-white in tone, was influenced by blanc de chine, or late Ming Chinese white porcelain; hence the plum-blossom decoration molded in low relief and the figurines in the Chinese manner. There was also decoration in high relief and painting in blue and in other colours on white.
