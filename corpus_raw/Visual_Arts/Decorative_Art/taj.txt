Taj,   brimless hat, usually conical or curved on top, worn by men and women in Muslim countries. The taj (from the Persian and Arabic words for crown) developed out of the ancient tiaras (see tiara) worn in the Mesopotamian valley. A hat of notability and prestige, the taj is often made of rich fabrics, brocaded, and bejeweled. Most, however, are made of felt or leather.
