Chaise longue, (French: “long chair”, ) plural Chaise Longues,  a long seat for reclining on. Developed in the 18th century, it closely resembled the daybed of the late 17th century and the bergère armchair, but with an extension of the seat beyond the front of the arms. Some chaise longues, said to be brisée, or broken, were divided into two or three parts, thus forming a chair and stool, sometimes with a separate footrest.
