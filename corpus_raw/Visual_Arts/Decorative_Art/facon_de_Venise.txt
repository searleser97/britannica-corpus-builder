Façon de Venise,   (French: “Venetian fashion”), style of glass made in the 16th and 17th centuries at places other than Venice itself but using the techniques that had been perfected there. It may be outwardly so similar as to be difficult to distinguish from Venetian glass (q.v.) proper. The prestige of Venetian glass was so great in the rest of Europe that French, German, Bohemian, Netherlandish, Spanish, and English glassmakers evolved their versions of Venetian style.
The importance that façon de Venise assumed for major European glasshouses as a selling line was substantial. The earliest notable glass made in England other than primitive forest glass was façon de Venise; a Venetian émigré, Jacopo Verzelini (1522–1606), produced it in London from 1573 and was granted a royal privilege for glassmaking in 1575. He had been preceded by eight Venetian workers who had established themselves in London in 1545. At Antwerp, Venetian influence was strong and the glass industry (in the 16th century) was started with Venetian glassmakers. Spanish 17th-century glass differs from its Venetian counterparts only in degree of technical perfection. However, at the end of the 17th century the prestige of Venetian glass declined in Europe.
