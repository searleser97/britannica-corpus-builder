Blue-and-white ware,  white porcelain decorated with blue under the glaze. At least as early as the 9th century, underglaze blue had been used in the Middle East, whence it was introduced to China in the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). Particularly notable are the blue-and-white wares produced in China during the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties. From China, underglaze blue was introduced to Europe.
