Tortoiseshell,   ornamental material obtained from the curved horny shields forming the shell of the hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). The marbled, varicoloured pattern and deep translucence of the plates have long been valued for manufacture of jewelry and other items. Tortoiseshell was imported to Rome from Egypt, and in 17th-century France, tortoiseshell work was raised to the level of artistry for jewel cases, trays, snuffboxes, and other decorated articles. The craft soon spread to other parts of Europe, where it was also highly developed.
Tortoiseshell is first separated from the bony skeleton by heat; the shields are flattened by heat and pressure, and irregularities are rasped away. Tortoiseshell is easily molded by heat and pressure and can be shaped on a lathe. The use of tortoiseshell, however, is illegal today in many parts of the world.
