Zucchetto,   small silk skullcap worn by Roman Catholic clergymen. Developed from the pileus (q.v.), a close-fitting, brimless hat commonly worn by the Romans, the zucchetto has probably been worn by ecclesiastics since the 13th century. It was worn under the mitre and biretta to preserve them and is still worn under these headcoverings at services. It is worn alone at other times. The colour depends on the wearerâ€™s rank: white for the pope, red for cardinals, violet for bishops, and black for others.
