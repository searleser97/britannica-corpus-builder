Vyala, also called sardula,  popular motif in Indian art, consisting of a composite leonine creature with the head of a tiger, elephant, bird, or other animal, frequently shown in combat with humans or pouncing upon an elephant. Essentially a solar symbol, it represents—like the eagle seizing the serpent—the triumph of the spirit over matter.
Occurring in a relatively naturalistic form in the earliest monuments, notably the great stupa at Sanchi (c. 50 bc) and in the Kushan sculpture of Mathura (1st–3rd century ad), the vyala assumed a definite stylized form about the 5th century. From the 8th century onward, it was constantly employed in architectural decoration, being repeated, for example, on the walls of temples.
