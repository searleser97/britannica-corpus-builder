Ersari carpet,  any of a colourful variety of floor coverings handmade by Ersari Turkmen of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Contrary to the custom of the other Turkmen, the Ersaris have no proper gul, or specific tribal motif; consequently, their carpets may have lattices of stepped diamonds, grids of rectangular panels rather like a garden carpet, diagonal rows of small motifs, much-distorted arrangements of Chinese cloud bands, rows of stylized palm trees, or degenerate imitations of Persian herƒÅti and mina khani patterns. Ersari carpets make more use of yellow than do rugs made by other tribes, and often, in backgrounds, two shades of blue blend or are merged with dark brown in a characteristic fashion. Prayer rugs differ from those of the other Turkmen in having frank prayer-niche designs, the arch (to indicate the direction of Mecca, the holy city) constricted at the head. These Ersari prayer rugs are among the most attractive Turkmen products. Ersari carpets are more loosely woven than those of the other Turkmens, with softer wool in coarser knotting.
