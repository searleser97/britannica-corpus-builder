Roll of arms,  illuminated manuscript describing (blazoning) and often illustrating (emblazoning) the arms of persons present at a particular battle or tournament. In addition to their historical interest, these rolls are excellent examples of heraldic art. There has been no break in the compilation of rolls of arms for official purposes since their origin in the mid-13th century. The official registers of heraldic administrations (such as those of the Lyon Court in Scotland) still maintain collections of rolls of arms recording armorial ensigns and insignia of historical import. See also heraldry.
