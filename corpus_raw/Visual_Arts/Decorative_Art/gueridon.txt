Gueridon,   small stand or table designed to support a candelabrum. It was introduced into France and Italy in the second half of the 17th century in the form of a carved black figure, known as a blackamoor, holding a tray above his or her head.
Some of the finest examples of gueridons were carved by Andrea Brustolon and survive in the Caâ€™ Rezzonico in Venice. The name was also given to small 18th-century and early 19th-century French tables of various designs, particularly Neoclassical. See also candlestand.
