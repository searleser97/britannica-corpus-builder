Chintz,   plainwoven, printed or solid-colour, glazed cotton fabric, frequently a highly glazed printed calico. Originally “chintz” (from the Hindi word meaning “spotted”) was stained or painted calico produced in India. The modern fabric is commonly made in several colours on a light ground and used for decorative (see photograph) and apparel purposes. Unglazed chintz is known as cretonne.
