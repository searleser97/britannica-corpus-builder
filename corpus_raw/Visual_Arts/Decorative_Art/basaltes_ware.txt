Basaltes ware, also called Black Basaltes, basaltes also spelled Basalt,  hard black vitreous stoneware, named after the volcanic rock basalt and manufactured by Josiah Wedgwood at Etruria, Staffordshire, Eng., from about 1768. Wedgwood’s black basaltes ware was an improvement on the stained earthenware known as “Egyptian black” made by other Staffordshire potters.
The fine-grained basaltes stoneware reflected Wedgwood’s Neoclassicism: its dense, uniform surface, requiring no glaze, was polished to a dull gloss; the ornament was usually intricate and well-defined, often in complex geometric designs and either molded and applied or incised by turning on a lathe. Early productions included “bronze Etruscan” vases with faint gilding and copies of Greek vase painting in mat red and white encaustic enamels on the black ground. Classical relief medallions, cameos, and plaques were imitated in black basaltes, and even tea and coffee sets were made; small statues were fashioned as well as important life-size “library” busts of classical and modern philosophers and authors. Some basaltes ware is essentially severe, with no decoration or added ornamentation.
