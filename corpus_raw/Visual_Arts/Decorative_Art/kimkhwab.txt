Kimkhwāb,   Indian brocade woven of silk and gold or silver thread. The word kimkhwāb, derived from the Persian, means “a little dream,” a reference perhaps to the intricate patterns employed; kimkhwāb also means “woven flower,” an interpretation that appears more applicable to the brocade, in view of the floral patterns common to the material. Kimkhwāb, known in India from ancient times, was called hiraṇya, or cloth of gold, in Vedic literature (c. 1500 bc). In the Gupta period (4th–6th century ad) it was known as puṣpapaṭa, or cloth with woven flowers. During the Mughal period (1556–1707), when kimkhwāb was extremely popular with the rich, the great centres of brocade weaving were Benares (Vārānasi), Ahmādābād, Surat, and Aurangābād. Benares is now the most important centre of kimkhwāb production.
Kimkhwābs are classified according to the amount of gold and silver thread used: some are woven entirely from the two precious metals; in some, coloured silk thread is used sparingly to accent the design; and in others most of the work is done in silk thread, the gold and silver being sparingly used. The patterns favoured for brocades are floral meanders and sprays, pinecones, rosettes, arabesques (patterns of interlaced lines), and stylized plants such as the poppy.
