Turf,   in horticulture, the surface layer of soil with its matted, dense vegetation, usually grasses grown for ornamental or recreational use. Such turf grasses include Kentucky bluegrass, creeping bent grass, fine or red fescue, and perennial ryegrass among the popular cool-season types and Bermuda grass, zoysia grass, and St. Augustine grass among the warm-season types.
Turf grasses are often grown on turf, or sod, farms. Portions of the sod—as plugs, blocks, squares, or strips of turf grass—are cut and transplanted to areas where they quickly establish and grow. Lawns are fine-textured turfs that are mowed regularly and closely to develop into dense, uniformly green coverings that beautify open spaces and provide sports playing surfaces, as in tennis lawns, golf and bowling greens, and racing turfs. See also bent grass; Bermuda grass; bluegrass; carpet grass; fescue; ryegrass; Zoysia.
