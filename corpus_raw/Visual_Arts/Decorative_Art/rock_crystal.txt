Rock crystal,  transparent variety of the silica mineral quartz that is valued for its clarity and total lack of colour or flaws. Vessels and spheres have been carved from large crystals since ancient times, and the application of the word crystal to fine glassware derives from this practice. Rock crystal formerly was used extensively as a gemstone (usually brilliant-cut) but has been replaced by glass and plastic; rhinestones originally were quartz pebbles found in the Rhine River. Although the resemblance to diamond is remote, the widespread use of colourless quartz in jewelry gave rise to the use of the word diamond in the description of quartz crystals from many areas, as the “Herkimer diamond” from Herkimer County, New York. The optical properties of rock crystal led to its use in lenses and prisms; its piezoelectric properties are used to control the oscillation of electrical circuits. Its physical properties are those of quartz (see silica mineral).
