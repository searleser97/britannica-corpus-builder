Poncho,  article of clothing of ancient origin, a cloak made of a square or rectangle of cloth with a hole in the middle through which the wearerâ€™s head protrudes. The original poncho, consisting of a rough, brightly coloured, handloomed cloth, was worn in early cultures of Latin America. Ponchos are worn with the edges hanging either parallel or diagonally, forming a diamond shape. The style also was adapted as rain gear, made of a waterproof material, and often hooded.
