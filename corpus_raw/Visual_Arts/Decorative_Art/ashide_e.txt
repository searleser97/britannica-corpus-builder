Ashide-e,   (Japanese: “reed-script picture”), decorative, cursive style of Japanese calligraphy, the characters of which resemble natural objects, that is used to decorate scrolls, stationery, and lacquerware. The typical ashide-e is a decorative representation of a poem, in which stylized characters serve as both text and illustration. There are also ashide-e that do not represent a specific poem but a poetic sentiment. The ashide-e as a variety of poem-picture (uta-e) was often used on maki-e (lacquerware decorated with gold or silver) such as ink-slab cases and letter boxes.
