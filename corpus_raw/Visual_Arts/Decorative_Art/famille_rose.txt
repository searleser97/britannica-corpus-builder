Famille rose, (French: “rose family”)  group of Chinese porcelain wares characterized by decoration painted in opaque overglaze rose colours, chiefly shades of pink and carmine. These colours were known to the Chinese as yangcai (“foreign colours”) because they were first introduced from Europe (about 1685). By the time of the reign of Yongzheng (1722–35) in the Qing dynasty (1644–1911/12), these shades were favoured over the translucent famille verte overglaze colours that were previously used and famille rose wares became especially popular during that reign.
