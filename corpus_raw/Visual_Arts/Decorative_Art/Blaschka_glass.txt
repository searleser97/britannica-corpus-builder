Blaschka glass,   glass models, primarily of natural history specimens, made by Leopold Blaschka (died 1895) and his son Rudolph (died 1939). The Blaschkas were Bohemian, or Czech, by birth but worked in Germany. Their most famous production was the Ware Collection of Glass Models of Plants, a collection of almost 4,000 models of flowers, plants, and flower parts, made at Dresden between 1887 and 1936 for the Botanical Museum of Harvard University. In their exquisite coloration, minute detail, and representational accuracy, these models fulfill their original purpose of botanical study; moreover, technically and artistically they are among the finest glass objects ever made. The models are still on display at the Botanical Museum. The Blaschkas also made models of marine life for the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard.
