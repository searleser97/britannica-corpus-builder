Ottoman court carpet,  floor covering handwoven under the earlier Ottoman sultans of Turkey. Extremely fine, handsome carpets—of wool pile on a foundation of silk or wool, having floral patterning, often with schemes of large or small circular medallions—and comparable prayer rugs were made for the court, possibly at Bursa in the 16th century.
Coarser, all-wool examples were made in Cairo after the conquest in 1517 and probably also in Anatolia. In due course many of these carpets were exported to southern Europe, where they have been preserved. Although mentioned in old records, all-silk examples do not seem to have survived.
