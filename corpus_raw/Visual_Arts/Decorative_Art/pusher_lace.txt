Pusher lace,   lace made in the 19th century at Nottingham, Eng., on the “pusher” machine, patented in 1812 by S. Clark and J. Mart. Modified by J. Synyer in 1825, the pusher machine was the first to produce a twisted patterned lace. In 1839, when combined with the Jacquard apparatus, the pusher machine could copy convincingly such handmade laces as Chantilly, except for the outlining thread, which continued to be hand run.
