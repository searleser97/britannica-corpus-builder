Faience fine,   fine white English lead-glazed earthenware, or creamware, imported into France from about 1730 onward. Staffordshire “salt glaze” was imported first, followed by the improved Wedgwood “Queen’s ware” and the Leeds “cream-coloured ware.” It was cheaper than French faience, or tin-glazed earthenware, and more durable and was therefore subjected to heavy tariffs in 1741 and 1749. A Franco-British treaty of 1786, placing a nominal duty on imported creamware, practically ruined the ordinary faience industry of France, and its extinction was completed for domestic use in the first half of the 19th century by the growth of indigenous makers of grès façon d’Angleterre (or faience fine). Some of these factories had employed expatriate English potters, such as the Leigh brothers who managed a factory at Douai, whose products resemble and are often mistaken for Leeds ware. Despite its name, faience fine is not true faience but a lead-glazed earthenware.
