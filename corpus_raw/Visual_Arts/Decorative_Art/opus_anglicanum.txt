Opus anglicanum,   (Latin: “English work”), embroidery done in England between about 1100 and about 1350 and of a standard unsurpassed anywhere. The technical skill that was shown by English workers in handling gold—i.e., silver gilt thread—was unequaled. Gold was used in large expanses as background for figures that were embroidered in coloured silks. Another characteristic of opus anglicanum was the general vivacity of expression and pose in the figure modeling of features—the use of split stitches worked spirally, for example, to suggest rotund cheeks and black, popping eyes. Minutely observed birds and animals, clearly based on contemporary animal drawings, figured largely in the decorative schemes.
Opus anglicanum was famous throughout Europe. Liturgical vestments such as copes in this type of embroidery were given and sold to churches abroad, including the cathedral church of San Giovanni in Laterano, Rome, where they were much prized; several popes commissioned such vestments. Opus anglicanum has consequently survived all over Europe wherever historic vestments are treasured; there are also examples in the United States in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. In England the largest collection is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, which possesses, among other examples, several famous copes, including the Syon cope (late 13th century) and the Butler-Bowden cope (early 14th century).
