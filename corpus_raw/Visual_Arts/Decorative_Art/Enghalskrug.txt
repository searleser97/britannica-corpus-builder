Enghalskrug,   German faience ewer with an ovoid body and a long narrow neck, which has a hinged pewter lid, a slight lip, and a broad foot, usually bound with a ring of pewter. After having been developed as a specialty at Hanau, Enghalskrüge were made at a number of German factories in the 17th and 18th centuries. There are many local variations in shape and style: the long-necked jugs of Frankfurt, for instance, are large-bellied with a spreading neck and a thin, twisted handle; those of Ansbach have long, pointed handles; those of Nürnberg are pear-shaped with semicircular handles. Those of Künersberg, with a brilliant white glaze, are of great elegance.
