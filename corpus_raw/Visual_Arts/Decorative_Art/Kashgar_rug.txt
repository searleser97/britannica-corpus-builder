Kashgar rug,  floor covering handwoven at Kashgar (Kashi) in Chinese Turkistan (now the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang). The Kashgar rugs are difficult to distinguish from the similar ones of Khotan (Hotan) and Yarkand (Yarkant).
All three types were formerly called Samarkands in the market. The principal differences between Kashgar rugs and the other two Xinjiang products are a tendency on the part of the former toward Persian draftsmanship, Persian-oriented border patterns, and, further, the greater use of dark outlines about the various forms.
