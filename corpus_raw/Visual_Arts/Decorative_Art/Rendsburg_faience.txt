Rendsburg faience,   German tin-glazed earthenware produced between 1764 and 1772 in the town of Rendsburg at a factory founded by Caspar Lorenzen and Christian Friedrich Clar. The few surviving examples of this ware are mainly ornamental rather than utilitarian (cane handles and snuffboxes, for example) and are decorated with Chinese floral designs painted in manganese or blue.
