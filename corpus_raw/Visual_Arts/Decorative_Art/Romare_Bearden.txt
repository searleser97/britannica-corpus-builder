Romare Bearden, in full Romare Howard Bearden,  (born September 2, 1911, Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S.—died March 12, 1988, New York City, New York), American painter, whose collages of photographs and painted paper on canvas depict aspects of American black culture in a style derived from Cubism. He is considered one of the most important African American artists of the 20th century.
Bearden was born in North Carolina but grew up in New York City and Pittsburgh. He studied at the Art Students League in New York City with George Grosz (1936–37) and at Columbia University (1943). His early paintings were realistic and often religious in theme (e.g., The Annunciation, 1942). After military service during World War II, he lived in Paris (1950–51), studied at the Sorbonne, and traveled extensively in Europe. During this period he developed his mature, semiabstract collage style. He first achieved recognition in the mid-1940s, and by the 1960s he had come to be regarded as the preeminent collagist in the U.S.
The narrative structure of Bearden’s paintings is simple and archetypal; ritual, music, and family are his pervasive themes. His works’ complexity lies in their poetic abstraction, in which layered fragments of colour and pattern evoke the rhythms, textures, and mysteries of a people’s experience (e.g., in Family, 1969).
Bearden also was a songwriter and book illustrator, and he occasionally designed sets for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Company. In 1990 the Romare Bearden Foundation was established to promote his work and to support African American artists.
