Rennes faience,   French tin-glazed earthenware, produced in Rennes, distinguished by the use of manganese purple. Most original products have an extreme rocaille shape decorated with many naturalistic flowers. But the majority of the ware produced in the numerous factories of this Breton centre in the 18th century show the strong influence of both Marseille and Rouen, though Rennes never used red.
