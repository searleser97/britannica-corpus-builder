Ge kiln, Pinyin Ge yao, Wade-Giles romanization Ko yao,  kiln known for the wares it produced during the early Song dynasty (960–1162), probably in the Zhejiang province in China. Scholars are uncertain of the kiln’s exact location. Legends recorded in documents of the Ming dynasty suggest that the kiln was named after the elder brother of the director of the Longquan kiln. Typical forms of Ge ware included tripods, fish-handle stoves, and five-foot stoves. The bodies of the wares varied from thick to thin and were usually black, but sometimes gray or yellow. Glazes often covered fine networks of cracks and were usually pale blue, moon-coloured white, gray, or greenish yellow. Extant pieces of Ge ware are spread throughout China and the world.
