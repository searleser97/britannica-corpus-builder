Drawn thread work, Italian Punto Tirato,  in fabric, a method of producing a design by drawing threads out of the body of a piece of material, usually linen, and working stitches on the mesh thus created. In Italy it preceded the development, in the 16th century, of needle lace, and it continued to be practiced internationally even after. It appears on embroidery samplers from the 17th century onward and is a technique common to embroidery and lace.
