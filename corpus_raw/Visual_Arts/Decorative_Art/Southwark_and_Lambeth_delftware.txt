Southwark and Lambeth delftware,   tin-glazed earthenware made at a number of factories at Southwark, London, and nearby Lambeth, Vauxhall, Bermondsey, and Aldgate during the 17th and 18th centuries. Typical 17th-century examples include wine bottles, drug pots, and ointment pots, usually decorated in blue on white. Sometimes the decoration consists of bold horizontal lines and freehand lettering, sometimes of arms, shells, masks, or cupids. Large dishes in blue, green, yellow, orange, and purplish black, with biblical and other scenes, belong to this period.
In the 18th century several new styles arose; the plates of this period show sketchy scenes in the Chinese manner, with figures, trees, and architectural details executed sometimes in blue only (on a white ground) but often in various combinations of the colours mentioned. The keynote of the style was free and almost slapdash brushwork: effects were achieved by hatching and bold horizontal or vertical brushstrokes. Abstract rather than naturalistic floral festoons, bunches, and sprays were similarly rendered.
