Chiton, Greek Chitōn,  garment worn by Greek men and women from the Archaic period (c. 750–c. 500 bc) through the Hellenistic period (323–30 bc). Essentially a sleeveless shirt, the chiton was a rectangular piece of linen (Ionic chiton) or wool (Doric chiton) draped by the wearer in various ways and kept in place at the shoulders by brooches (fibulae) and at the waist by a belt. Excess fabric (the chiton was longer than the wearer was tall) was pulled up under the belt in blouse fashion. At all times the chiton was worn at ankle length by women.
During the Archaic period, Greek men wore a long chiton; thereafter, except for charioteers, priests, and the elderly, they wore a knee-length version. Sleeved chitons were worn by actors and priests. Patterns and colours varied with the times and with the status of the wearer. The chiton is well illustrated in the caryatid (q.v.) porch of the Erechtheum in Athens.
