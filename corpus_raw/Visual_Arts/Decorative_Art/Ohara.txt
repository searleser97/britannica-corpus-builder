Ohara,  Japanese school of floral art, founded by Ohara Unshin in the early 20th century, which introduced the moribana style of naturalistic landscapes in shallow, dishlike vases. The moribana style, while retaining a basic triangular structure in its floral arrangements, is in the nageire (fresh and spontaneous) mood. The Ohara school’s use of taller, narrow-mouthed vases is of the shōka (free and informal) style, but it is known as heika. The styles of this school grew in popularity throughout the 20th century, superseding the traditional and formalistic rikka style.
