Louis XV style,  in the decorative arts, a Rococo style characterized by the superior craftsmanship of 18th-century cabinetmaking in France. The proponents of this style produced exquisite Rococo decor for the enormous number of homes owned by royalty and nobility during the reign of Louis XV. Emphasis was laid on the ensemble, so that painters and sculptors became a part of the decorative arts. Some of the famous names connected with the finest in Louis XV Rococo style are those of the painter François Boucher; the sculptor, painter, and decorator Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier; the German craftsman J.-F. Oeben, whose intricate floral marquetry and ingenious mechanical specialities are extraordinary; and Pierre Migeon, a favourite of Mme de Pompadour. The full range of richness in decorative techniques is represented in this period—superb carving, ornamentation in all sorts of metal, inlaid work in woods, metal, mother-of-pearl, and ivory, as well as the pinnacle of achievement in lacquered chinoiserie.
Louis XV furniture combines usefulness with elegance. Chairs have curved legs, floral decorations, and comfortably padded seats and backs, yet sacrifice nothing in design. In addition to nature and Orientalia, fantasy played a large part in motifs, with curious animals and exotic landscapes adorning all surfaces. Rare woods such as tulip, lemon tree, violet, and king woods were used for sumptuous effects, and richly veined and tinted marbles were also imported. The art of polishing reached its peak in this period, even rivalling objects from the Far East. At its most extreme the Rococo mode became deliberately asymmetrical, although contriving always to maintain a harmonious balance within the larger scheme of decor. It was the fashion for each home to have at least two complete sets of furniture, for summer and winter.
