Shufu ware, Wade-Giles romanization shu-fu,  Chinese white porcelain made during the Yuan dynasty (1206–1368) at Jingdezhen. It was the first-known porcelain ordered by imperial officials, and so it sometimes bore the characters shufu (literally “central palace,” or privy council). The body of the ware was covered with a bluish opaque glaze, while the base was unglazed. Common forms of the ware included plates, bowls, and tall foot bowls. Artisans sometimes added molded relief to such round wares.
