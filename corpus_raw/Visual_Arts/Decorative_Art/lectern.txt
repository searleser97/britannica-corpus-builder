Lectern,  originally a pedestal-based reading desk with a slanted top used for supporting liturgical books—such as Bibles, missals, and breviaries at religious services; later, a stand that supports a speaker’s books and notes. In early Christian times, lecterns, then known as ambos, were incorporated into the structure of the sanctuary—one on the north side of the choir for reading the Epistle, the other at the south for reading the Gospel.
The rise of monasticism, with its more elaborate rituals and heavier prayer books, stimulated the demand for a mobile lectern that could be moved about the sanctuary according to need. Usually made of wood, though occasionally of metal, the lectern lent itself to elaborate decorative treatment. The desklike structure was largely superseded in the later Middle Ages by an eagle, the back of whose outstretched wings provided support for a book; this type of lectern has maintained its popularity in ecclesiastical circles ever since. As the Reformation tended to favour congregation-orientated services, the lectern was moved into the body of the church. The Gothic Revival stimulated the production of lecterns in the 19th century, when they were often used to embellish the domestic interior. The modern secular lectern is usually a tall, narrow desk with a sloping top and a ledge to hold a dictionary, book, or other papers while its user reads or lectures from a standing position.
