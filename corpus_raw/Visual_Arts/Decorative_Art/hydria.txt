Hydria,  large water vessel in Greek pottery of the Archaic period (c. 750–c. 480 bc) and the Classical period (c. 480–c. 330 bc). It is found in both the black-figure and the red-figure pottery styles. The hydria is distinctive in having three handles: a pair of small, horizontal handles at the sides for lifting and a large, vertical handle at the neck or shoulder for dipping and pouring.
