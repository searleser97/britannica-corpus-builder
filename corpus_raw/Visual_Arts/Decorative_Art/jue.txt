Jue, Wade-Giles romanization chüeh,  type of ancient Chinese pitcherlike container used for wine and characterized by an elegant and dynamic shape.
The jue can either be a type of pottery or it can be bronze. It is much like the jia except for the rim, which is drawn into a large, projecting, U-shaped spout (with capped pillars at the base) on one side and a pointed tail, or handle, flaring out from the opposite side. A taotie, or monster mask, is commonly found on either side of the body, much like the jia.
The earliest pottery jue was found in the so-called Longshan culture (c. 2500–2000 bce) during the late Neolithic Period. The bronze jue was more widely used during the Shang (c. 1600–1046 bce) and early Zhou (1046–256 bce) dynasties, but its popularity later diminished. Some pottery copies of the bronze jia were also used as spirit utensils (mingqi) that were placed in tombs.
