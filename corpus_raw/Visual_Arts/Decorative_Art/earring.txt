Earring,   a personal ornament worn pendent from the ear, usually suspended by means of a ring or hook passing through a pierced hole in the lobe of the ear or, in modern times, often by means of a screwed clip on the lobe. The impulse to decorate or to modify the appearance of the ear seems to be almost universal. In general, usage appears to call for wearing earrings in pairs, the two ornaments in all respects resembling each other; but a single earring has sometimes been worn. (The single earring was especially popular in Europe during the Renaissance and Baroque period.)
In the Orient, earrings historically were worn by both sexes; in the West (including ancient Israel and Egypt) as a general rule, they were considered to be exclusively female ornaments. Among the Greeks and Romans earrings were worn only by women, and the practice of men wearing them often is spoken of in classical literature as a distinctly Oriental (i.e., Middle Eastern) trait.
In the tombs of the Greek settlers on the Crimean Peninsula (4th century bc), earrings of marvelous complexity and beauty were found. Jewels of the same class, of exquisite beauty and workmanship, were found in the sepulchres of ancient Etruria. Earrings of comparatively simple forms, but set with pearls and other stones, were the mode in Rome.
In Europe, earrings tended to go out of fashion when the wig, coiffure, or headdress obscured the ears, as in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Use of these ornaments continued to be unfashionable in Europe and the Americas during the 19th century but were revived again in the 20th, especially with the introduction of clipping devices. Simplified painless methods of piercing the ears led to the renewed popularity of pierced earrings.
