Baku rug,  handwoven floor covering made in the vicinity of Baku, Azerbaijan, a major port on the Caspian Sea. Rugs have been woven in this area since at least the 18th century and probably long before, although it is difficult to determine which were woven in the city and which in such nearby villages as Surahani and Chaildag. The so-called Chila rugs were almost certainly woven in this area.
The earliest examples are larger than most Caucasian rugs, ranging about 5 × 12 feet (1.5 × 3.6 metres), often showing either an avshan (“scattered” floral sprig) or harshang (“crab”) design. Examples from later production may have some cotton in the wefts and are more likely to show a boteh (pear-shaped motif) design, often with a small medallion. Most of these rugs have a blue field.
