Gerhard Marcks,  (born February 18, 1889, Berlin, Germany—died November 13, 1981, Cologne, West Germany [now Germany]), German sculptor, printmaker, and designer who helped to revive the art of sculpture in Germany during the first quarter of the 20th century.
Marcks was educated in the atelier of the sculptor Richard Scheibe; there he often sculpted animals in terra-cotta. Marcks served in World War I from 1914 to 1915. Upon his return he adopted a more Expressionist style in his work, rendering human figures with a simplified angularity that recalls Gothic sculpture. In 1920 he was appointed to run the ceramics workshop at the Weimar Bauhaus, where his focus was hand-painted pottery. Lyonel Feininger, who ran the Bauhaus printmaking workshop, encouraged him to explore woodcut, a medium Marcks continued to use throughout his career.
Marcks eventually decided that his approach was at odds with the increasing emphasis on technology at the Bauhaus, so he resigned when the school moved to Dessau in 1925. He assumed a position teaching pottery at the Halle School of Arts and Crafts and rededicated himself to figurative sculpture. His Expressionistic tendencies became more subdued, although he continued to imbue his works with emotion. In 1933 the Nazis dismissed Marcks from his teaching post. They declared his work “degenerate” in 1937 and barred him from exhibiting.
Marcks is also noted for his sculptures of animals done after World War II, which owe much to the influence of the German sculptor August Gaul. Marcks’s important commissions include war memorials in Cologne and Hamburg. In 1971 the Gerhard Marcks Museum in Bremen was founded. His bronze doors for the convent church at Magdeburg, Germany, were unveiled in 1977.
