Country furniture,   furniture made by country craftsmen, varying from purely functional pieces made by amateurs to expertly constructed and carved work based on luxurious furniture made for the rich. Much country furniture is naive, with the best of such examples falling into the category of folk art. The furniture is sturdy, rarely delicate in design or workmanship, and restricted in its types. Decoration may be confined to turning (shaping on a lathe), low-relief carving, or painting. More sophisticated decoration such as marquetry or gilding is not found on this type of furniture. Country furniture bore many of the same characteristics for centuries, for styles changed slowly and lingered long after they had been dropped in fashionable furniture.
It is often marked by local characteristics determined by materials locally available, by local crafts, and sometimes by the influence of sophisticated urban styles. The Windsor chair is one of the best-known examples of country furniture. It is probably in France that country, or provincial, furniture, which assumed marked regional characteristics, reached its highest level of development. Far from being naive in character, much of it is an inventive but simplified version of the fashionable styles created in Paris.
