Cabriole leg,  leg of a piece of furniture shaped in two curvesâ€”the upper one convex, the lower one concave. Its shape was based on the legs of certain four-footed animals. Known by the ancient Chinese and by the Greeks, it returned to fashion in Europe in the late 17th century, when it was incorporated into the more curvilinear styles introduced by the English, Dutch, and French.
The early revived forms of the cabriole leg were joined by stretchers, but these were abandoned, as they interrupted the line of the leg and were not needed for strength. In the third quarter of the 18th century, its popularity gave way to the straight leg of the Neoclassical period.
