Peridot, also called precious olivine,  gem-quality, transparent green olivine in the forsterite–fayalite series (q.v.). Gem-quality olivine has been valued for centuries; the deposit on Jazīrat Zabarjad (Saint Johns Island), Egypt, in the Red Sea that is mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History (ad 70) still produces fine gems. Very large crystals are found in the Mogok district of Myanmar (Burma); peridots from the United States are seldom larger than two carats. Yellow-green peridot has been called chrysolite (Greek: “golden stone”); this term, used for various unrelated minerals, has become less common for the gemstone. Peridot is generally faceted with a step cut.
