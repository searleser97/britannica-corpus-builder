Liberale da Verona, also called Liberale di Jacopo dalla Brava,  (born c. 1445, Verona, Republic of Venice [Italy]—died  1526/29, Verona), early Renaissance artist, one of the finest Italian illuminators of his time.
Liberale’s name derives from his native city of Verona, where he trained as a miniaturist and panel painter. He was influenced initially by Andrea Mantegna and by the Mantegnesque miniaturist Girolamo da Cremona, with whom he worked (1467–69) illuminating choir books. In 1470–74 he illuminated the choir books of Siena Cathedral, now preserved in the Piccolomini Library. These are some of the finest and most ornate Italian miniatures of their time. Their calligraphic style and imagery exercised a deep influence in Siena, above all on the paintings of Matteo di Giovanni and Francesco di Giorgio. About 1488 Liberale returned to Verona, where he executed (c. 1490) some frescoes in the Cappella Bonaveri in Sant’Anastasia. Though such frescoes as the “Lamentation over the Dead Christ” reveal Liberale as a forceful and expressive artist, his panel paintings seldom approach the quality of his illuminations. In his later works he degenerates into a flaccid style, which had some local influence.
