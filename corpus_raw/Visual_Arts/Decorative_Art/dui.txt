Dui, Wade-Giles romanization tui,  type of Chinese bronze vessel produced in the late Zhou dynasty (c. 600–256/255 bc), it was a food container consisting of two bowls—each supported on three legs—that, when placed together, formed a sphere. The dui usually had two loop handles on either side of the rim of each bowl. The decoration of the dui was characteristic of the late Zhou period, when rich, dense patterns, often enhanced with inlays, were common. It was later replaced by a boxlike food container (the sheng) during the Qin and Han dynasties.
