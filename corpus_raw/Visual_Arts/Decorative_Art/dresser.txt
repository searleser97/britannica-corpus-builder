Dresser,  a cupboard used for the display of fine tableware, such as silver, pewter, or earthenware. Dressers were widely used in England beginning in Tudor times, when they were no more than a side table occasionally fitted with a row of drawers. The front stood on three or five turned (shaped on a lathe) legs linked by stretchers. Horizontal planes such as the dresserâ€™s top and drawer fronts were decorated with matching molding. A low backboard, often with narrow shelves or drawers, was introduced about 1690, and, soon afterward, a decorative shelf beneath the main drawers was added. Shelves without backs were added later to display English delftware. Dressers of this type became a common feature of the middle-class kitchen up to the 19th century.
In France the dresser was in use from the early years of the 16th century. Decorated with more elaborate carving than the English, it adopted architectural forms such as Gothic crockets (ornaments in the form of curved and bent foliage) and panels, reeded strapwork (design of narrow fillets or bands folded, crossed, or interlaced), cornices, and entablatures. Unlike the English dresser, it was basically a cupboard with two doors and a pot board below. A similar form was made in Germany, the lower portion enclosed by doors, the upper portion by recessed cupboards with a heavy cornice.
In the United States, the term dresser can denote either a cupboard to hold dishes and cooking utensils or a chest of drawers or bureau topped by a mirror for use in the bedroom.
