Bobbin furniture, also called Spool Furniture,  heavy furniture made in the late 17th century, whose legs and other parts were lathe-turned to ornamental shapes; also lighter, less boldly turned pieces made in 19th-century cottage style (see cottage furniture). Bobbin turning was a type of ornament consisting of a series of small knobs resembling spools, or bobbins, used on the legs and stretchers of chairs and tables, on the finials of the stiles (vertical posts) of chairbacks, and occasionally on the finials of the front arm supports.
