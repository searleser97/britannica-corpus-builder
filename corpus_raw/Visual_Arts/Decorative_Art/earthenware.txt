Earthenware,  pottery that has not been fired to the point of vitrification and is thus slightly porous and coarser than stoneware and porcelain. The body can be covered completely or decorated with slip (a liquid clay mixture applied before firing), or it can be glazed. For both practical and decorative reasons, earthenware is usually glazed. To overcome its porosity (which makes it impracticable for storing liquids in its unglazed state, for example), the fired object is covered with finely ground glass powder suspended in water and is then fired a second time. During the firing, the fine particles covering the surface fuse into an amorphous, glasslike layer, sealing the pores of the clay body. There are two main types of glazed earthenware. One is covered with a transparent lead glaze; when the earthenware body to which this glaze is applied has a cream colour, the product is called creamware. The second type, covered with an opaque white tin glaze, is variously called tin-enameled, or tin-glazed, earthenware, majolica, faience, or delft.
A crude, soft earthenware, excavated at a Neolithic settlement at Çatalhüyük, on the Anatolian Plateau of Turkey, and thought to be about 9,000 years old, is the earliest known pottery. Earthenware is still widely used in the 21st century, much of the commercially produced ware being heatproof and coldproof and thus practicable for cooking and freezing as well as for serving.
