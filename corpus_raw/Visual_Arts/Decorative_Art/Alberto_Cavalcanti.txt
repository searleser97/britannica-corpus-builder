Alberto Cavalcanti, original name Alberto de Almeida-Cavalcanti,  (born Feb. 6, 1897, Rio de Janeiro—died  Aug. 23, 1982, Paris), Brazilian-born director-producer, screenwriter, and art director of motion pictures in the mid-20th century who spent much of his career in Europe.
Cavalcanti established his reputation as a documentary filmmaker in Britain during the 1930s and went on to produce some notable films for Ealing Studios. In the 1950s he returned to Brazil and was a leading figure in the revival of Brazilian cinema. Cavalcanti studied architecture in Geneva, worked in French cinema as an art director, and in 1926 made the pioneering documentary Rien que les heures (1926; “Nothing But Time”), which portrayed the lives of Paris workers during a single day. In 1934 he went to Britain and joined John Grierson on the General Post Office (GPO) Film Unit to make Pett and Pott (1934), Coalface (1935; with Grierson and W.H. Auden), and We Live in Two Worlds (1937). The GPO’s productions were important milestones in the development of documentaries. Moving to Ealing Studios in 1941, he produced such wartime propaganda films as The Foreman Went to France (1942) and, after 1943, directed the features Champagne Charlie (1944), Nicholas Nickleby (1947), and They Made Me a Fugitive (1947). After returning to Brazil, he made O Canto do mar (1952; “The Song of the Sea”) and Mulher de verdade (1954; “Woman of Truth”) with his own company; but he fell under official suspicion because of his left-wing stance and in 1954 returned to Europe. Cavalcanti eventually settled in France, where he continued his work in television.
