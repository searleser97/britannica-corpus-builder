Pâte-sur-pâte,   (French: “paste on paste”), method of porcelain decoration in which a relief design is created on an unfired, unglazed body by applying successive layers of white slip (liquid clay) with a brush. The technique was first employed by the Chinese in the 18th century. It was introduced in Europe in about 1850 at Sèvres, where it was perfected by Marc-Louis Solon, who later worked for Minton. The technique was also used in the United States, at the Rookwood factory in Cincinnati, Ohio.
