Gui, Wade-Giles romanization kuei,  type of Chinese vessel produced during the Shang (18th–12th century bc) and Zhou (c. 1111–255 bc) dynasties. There were many varieties of the gui, which was a wide-mouthed container for food, but the typical bronze form consisted of a ring base and an ample, bowl-shaped body with slightly rounded sides. The vessel probably often had a lid. Precursors of the gui shape appeared in the pottery of the Neolithic Period (c. 3000–2000 bc). Pottery gui appeared in their fully evolved shape in the early Shang dynasty and were widely used by the middle of the Western Zhou dynasty. By the end of the Zhou period, the gui was no longer used in everyday life, but it was used as a funerary utensil. Stone and jade gui, probably used in a ritual capacity, were found at Yinxu.
In the bronze art of the Shang dynasty, the gui commonly had four lugs (ear-shaped protuberances) equally spaced on a decorative band just below the rim. As the shape developed in the Zhou dynasty, the lugs were replaced by two or four sturdy handles, often modeled with fanciful animal motifs. A substantial, boxlike stand often anchored the vessel in examples from the Zhou period.
