Robert Edmond Jones,  (born Dec. 12, 1887, Milton, N.H., U.S.—died  Nov. 26, 1954, Milton), U.S. theatrical and motion-picture designer whose imaginative simplification of sets initiated the 20th-century American revolution against realism in stage design.
Graduating from Harvard University (1910), Jones began designing scenery for the theatre in New York City in 1911. His settings for The Man Who Married a Dumb Wife (1915), a version by the French satirist Anatole France of an old French folk drama, employed an austere, gray-and-black, poster-like street facade and brilliant costumes. Jones achieved unencumbered, fluid stage arrangements in which it was possible (as it had been on the Shakespearean stage) to change scenes with a minimal shifting of props and backgrounds. Associated with Kenneth Macgowan as a director of the Greenwich Village Playhouse after 1925, Jones published, with Macgowan, Continental Stagecraft (1922) and by himself, The Dramatic Imagination (1941). He designed sets for play by Eugene O’Neill from 1921 through 1946. He began designing sets for colour motion pictures in 1933.
