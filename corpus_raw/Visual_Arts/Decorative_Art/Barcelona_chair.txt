Barcelona chair,  one of the most-recognized chairs of the 20th century. It was designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the German Pavilion, which he also designed, at the International Exposition in Barcelona in 1929.
The framework consists of two connected pairs of crossed steel bars: the single curve of the back continues into the front legs, and the rear legs, which cross these, form a double curve supporting the seat. The seat and back consist of leather straps supporting foam-rubber cushions covered with buttoned leather.
