Ningxia carpet,  floor covering woven in Hui Autonomous Region of Ningxia, China, characterized by stylized floral designs and subtle use of blue, red, and beige. Geometric patterns are sometimes used. The heavy wool pile of the Ningxia is cut so that the design is in relief. The foundation weave is cotton, and the brown of earlier examples is often eroded though the other colours may be intact.
