Westerwald stoneware,   salt-glazed stoneware produced in German towns such as Höhr, Grenzau, and Grenzhausen in the area known as the Westerwald. Their products (jugs, tankards, and the like), made from the 15th century to the present day, are molded, stamped with dies, and sometimes incised. Westerwald pottery received impetus from the immigration in the late 16th century of Anno Knütgen and his family from Siegburg to Höhr, and of the Mennicken family from Raeren to Grenzhausen. Although some late examples are white, bluish gray was the predominant colour of the wares, which were decorated in contrasting black, brownish purple, and, most frequently, dark blue.
