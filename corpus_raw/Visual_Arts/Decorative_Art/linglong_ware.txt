Linglong ware, Pinyin linglongci, or Wade-Giles ling-lung-tz’u,  Chinese porcelain made in the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911/12) dynasties and characterized by pierced ornamentation. Linglong ware was generally limited to small objects such as cups, brush pots, and covered jars. The decoration was sometimes biscuit (unglazed porcelain), either left white or enhanced with touches of gilding or coloured glazes.
Much linglong ware was made for the export trade by the Jingdezhen kilns (in Jiangxi), whose potters protested against the imperial order to make this gui gong (“devil’s work”), as linglong was also called in China. The term is thought to refer to the devilish skill needed to produce such porcelain, but it is possible that it referred to the foreign markets for which it was destined. Linglong wares made during the period of the emperor Qianlong (1736–96) during the Qing dynasty are considered the best.
