Kawai Kanjirō,   (born Aug. 24, 1890, Yasugi, Japan—died  Nov. 18, 1966, Kyōto), potter who sought to combine modern methods of manufacture with traditional Japanese and English designs.
Kanjirō graduated from the Tokyo Higher Polytechnical School in 1914 and worked briefly at the Kyōto Research Institute for Ceramics. In 1920 he built his own kiln in Kyōto and began to give exhibitions. His first works demonstrated his interest in Chinese and Korean techniques.
In 1925, in association with Yanagi Sōetsu and Hamada Shōji, he started the folk-art movement, developing ceramic ware for daily use employing styles from the old folk arts of Japan and England. After World War II he extended his efforts to the mass production of pottery with handicraft characteristics, employing techniques such as doro hakeme (literally, “brush-traits on the mud”), a method of simulating brushstrokes on the clay.
Kanjirō’s most notable individual works include a celadon porcelain flower vase with blood-red figure (1924), a pot with grass and flowers coloured in copper-red and iron-black (1937), and a flat pot with uchi-gusuri glazing (1962).
