Poke bonnet,  hood-shaped hat tied under the chin, with a small crown at the back and a wide projecting front brim that shaded the face. It became fashionable at the beginning of the 19th century and was worn by women and children of all ages. The size of the poke bonnet increased until, in 1830, a womanâ€™s face could not be seen except from directly in front. The fashion for small hats, which began in the 1860s, brought the era of the poke bonnet to an end.
