Bulla, plural Bullae,  characteristic Etruscan ornamental pendant. Typically round or oval, bullae resemble a lion or satyr head.
Bullae are hollow, often with filigree or granulation decorating the edges, and they have a removable loop (from which the pendant is hung). It is thought that the loop acted as a stopper for the bulla, which may have contained a liquid, presumably perfume. The word bulla now refers to a round lead seal attached to an official document from the pope.
