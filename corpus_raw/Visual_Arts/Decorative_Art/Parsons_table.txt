Parsons table,  simple, sturdy rectangular table having straight lines, overall flush surfaces, and square legs that form the four corners of the top and whose diameter is identical with the thickness of the top. It is not certain who designed the Parsons table, and it may have been the result of a class project, but prototypes exist in the early work of both the French interior designer Jean-Michel Frank (1896–1941) and the U.S. industrial and motion-picture interior designer Joseph B. Platt (1895–1968), both of whom were connected with the Paris branch of the Parsons School of Design in the 1920s and early 1930s.
The earliest versions were small, square occasional tables constructed of solid wood and covered with such textured surfaces as parchment, snakeskin, decoupage, straw marquetry, leather, sharkskin, or eggshell lacquer. Later, square and oblong models of various sizes often made of printed composition board or plastic, served as desks, sideboards, and game, lamp, and dining tables.
