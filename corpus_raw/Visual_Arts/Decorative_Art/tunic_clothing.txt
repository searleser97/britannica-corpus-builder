Tunic, Latin Tunica,  basic garment worn by men and women in the ancient Mediterranean world. It was fashioned from two pieces of linen sewn up the sides and across the top, with holes left for the head and arms. It reached to the knees or lower, was with or without sleeves, belted at the waist, and held at the shoulders by clasps. Essentially an undergarment, it was usually covered by a mantle but might be worn alone by the young or by workingmen. It was made of dark or light linen or white wool. Tunics that were worn by Roman senators and other dignitaries were decorated with broad purple stripes, and childrenâ€™s tunics were often decorated with various colours. The garment was worn into the European Middle Ages by both laity and clergy until finally replaced by the fitted body garment in the 14th century. Even after secular fashions changed, the tunic was retained in ecclesiastical vestments such as the alb and dalmatic. In the 20th century, the word usually refers to a long blouse.
