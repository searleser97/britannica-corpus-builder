Howard Staunton,  (born 1810—died June 22, 1874, London, England), British chess master who was considered to be the world’s leading player in the 1840s. In 1841 Staunton founded the first successful English chess magazine, and in 1851 he took the lead in organizing the first modern international chess tournament in London, where, however, he came in only fourth.
Little is known about Staunton’s early life. He apparently began as an actor and subsequently wrote on William Shakespeare, publishing an edition of his plays in monthly installments. After he won most of a series of 21 games against the top French player, Pierre Saint-Amant, in 1843, he was proclaimed Europe’s leading player, but he refused a match with Paul Morphy in 1858 with the excuse that he was preparing a Shakespeare edition; it is generally believed, however, that he would have been beaten by Morphy.
The standard tournament chess piece design was originated about 1835 and patented in 1849 by Nathaniel Cook. Following Staunton’s endorsement and extensive promotion of the design, it became known as the Staunton pattern.
