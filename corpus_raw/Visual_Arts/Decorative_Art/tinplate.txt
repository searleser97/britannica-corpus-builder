Tinplate,   thin steel sheet with a coating of tin applied either by dipping in molten metal or by electrolytic deposition; almost all tinplate is now produced by the latter process. Tinplate made by this process is essentially a sandwich in which the central core is strip steel. This core is cleaned in a pickling solution and then fed through tanks containing electrolyte, where tin is deposited on both sides. As the strip passes between high-frequency electric induction coils, it is heated so that the tin coating melts and flows to form a lustrous coat. The end product has a tin coating of about 0.00003 inch (0.00076 millimetre) on each side.
Tinplate has the strength and formability of steel combined with the noncorrosive and nontoxic properties of tin and has the additional property of easy solderability. While it is largely used for containers for food and beverages, paints, oils, tobacco, and numerous other products, its use has broadened to include toys, baking equipment, and parts for radio and other electronic equipment.
