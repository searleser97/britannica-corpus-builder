Ozier pattern,   in tableware, molded basket-weave pattern produced in Germany in the 1730s on Meissen porcelain tableware. It was probably one of the numerous inventions of the celebrated modeler Johann Joachim Kändler. There are four basic types of ozier molding: the ordinair-ozier (“ordinary ozier”), a kind of zigzag basket weave; the alt-ozier (“old ozier”), which has radial ribs; the neu-ozier (“new ozier”), the ribs of which resemble the curves of an S, appearing around 1742; and the Brühlsches Allerei-Dessin (“Brühl’s varied design”), a pattern of basketwork and molded motifs, such as shells and flowers, surrounded by Rococo scrollwork. Like much else that originated at Meissen, ozier molding was copied by other German porcelain factories, as well as porcelain factories in Chantilly, France; Copenhagen; and Chelsea, Eng.
