Saint-Porchaire faience, also called Henri Deux Ware, orFaïence Dʾoiron,  lead-glazed earthenware (inaccurately called faience, or tin-glazed ware) made in the second quarter of the 16th century at Saint-Porchaire in the département of Deux-Sèvres, France. Its uniqueness consisted in its method of decoration, which took the form of impressions stamped in the whitish soft clay with bookbinders’ stamps and filled in with clays of contrasting colour. Among the stamps used were those of King Henry II of France (hence the name Henri Deux ware), though the earthenware was also made in the reign of his predecessor, Francis I. Ornament consisted of abstract patterns under a yellowish lead glaze. Surviving examples are very rare.
