Sabot,  heavy work shoe worn by European peasants, especially in France and the Low Countries. There are two kinds of sabots: one is shaped and hollowed from a single piece of wood (called klompen by the Dutch), and the other is a heavy leather shoe with a wooden sole.
Variations of the sabot—wooden-soled shoes topped with a variety of materials such as leather and suede—became popular in the second half of the 20th century. The sabotine was a makeshift shoe of wood and leather that was worn during World War I.
