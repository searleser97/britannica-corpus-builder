Kāshān ware, sometimes also called (erroneously) lakabi ware, lakabi also spelled laqabi,  in Islamic ceramics, a style of lustreware pottery associated with Kāshān, Persia (Iran), from about the beginning of the 11th century until the mid-14th century. It was derived from motifs in earlier textiles and is especially noted for the density and delicate execution of its decorative patterns. The name lakabi ware (lakabi, “painted”) when applied to this style is a misnomer.
