Karabagh rug, Karabagh also spelled Karabakh,  floor covering handmade in the district of Karabakh (Armenian-controlled Azerbaijan), just north of the present Iranian border. As might be expected, Karabagh designs and colour schemes tend to be more like those of Persian rugs than do those made in other parts of the Caucasus, and it is difficult to distinguish Karabagh runners from those of Karaja, in Iran, to the south. Certain Karabagh rugs also resemble those of Shirvan to the north in Azerbaijan.
Commonly stout and comparatively coarse, Karabagh rugs are all made of wool and have longer pile than rugs found elsewhere in Caucasia. The heavy, curving bands of the dragon rugs appear in some examples, framing a central medallion. Other carpets feature elaborate “pole-medallion” arrangements that are based on the fine Persian carpets of an earlier day. Mirror Karabaghs are distinguished by oval medallions enclosing bouquets in the French manner, and Talysh rugs may have a perfectly plain field of dark blue with a delicate reciprocal edging. As has occurred in other areas of the Caucasus, a number of new definitive names have been coined, and the well-known Eagle and Cloudband Kazakh patterns are now claimed for Karabagh.
