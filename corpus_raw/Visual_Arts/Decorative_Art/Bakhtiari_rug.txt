Bakhtiari rug, also spelled Bakhtyārī,  handwoven pile floor covering made under Bakhtyārī patronage in certain villages southwest of Eṣfahān in central Iran. Bakhtiari rugs are symmetrically knotted on a foundation of cotton.
The colouring and patterns of these rugs are bold. The field is usually divided into compartments that may be rectangular or produced by an ogival lattice. Occasionally there are tree or medallion decorative schemes. The palette tends to be darker than is found on most Iranian rugs, with much use of yellow.
