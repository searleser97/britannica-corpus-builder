Manohar,  (flourished 1580–1620, India), a leading miniaturist of the Mughal school of painting in India, noted for his outstanding manuscript illustrations, portraits, and a few animal studies.
The son of the celebrated painter Basavan, Manohar executed his work primarily between 1580 and 1620 and spanned the reigns of the emperors Akbar and Jahāngīr. He primarily depicts the richness of Mughal court life and etiquette. He was acquainted with Western painting and incorporated small sections in his earlier work. The splendid picture depicting Jahāngīr in the hall of private audience when encamped at the city of Ajmer is one of his great works (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). There is some speculation that he later entered the atelier of Prince Dārā Shikōh, the son of the emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–1657/58).
