Indo-Eṣfahān carpet, also spelled Indo-Isfahan,  type of floor covering ranging from small to extremely large, handmade in India, primarily in the 17th century, as free imitations of Herāt designs. They appear to have been exported in quantity to Europe, especially to Portugal and the Low Countries, by the various East India companies and are frequently seen in 17th-century Dutch paintings. The usual field design consists of elaborate vine-leaf and floral palmettes in pairs, pointing in opposite directions and connected by scrolling vines, together with curving, feathery lancet leaves, cloud bands, and a host of small floral motifs on a ground of slightly purplish wine red. A blue or blue-green border often shows similar palmettes placed transversely in alternation with groups of five small palmettes.
At least some of these carpets may have been made in Āgra, where similar ones were still being produced in the 19th century. More fanciful patterns may have been produced in the Deccan and not exported. The borders introduce varied arrangements of arabesques and of lancet leaves. Beginning in the mid-1980s the Indian origin of these carpets began to be challenged by those who favoured an origin in Eṣfahān, Iran.
