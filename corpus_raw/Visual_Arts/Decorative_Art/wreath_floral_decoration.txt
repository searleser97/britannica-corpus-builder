Wreath,  circular garland, usually woven of flowers, leaves, and foliage, that traditionally indicates honour or celebration. The wreath in ancient Egypt was most popular in the form of a chaplet made by sewing flowers to linen bands and tying them around the head. In ancient Greece, wreaths, usually made of olive, pine, laurel, celery, or palm, were awarded to athletes victorious in the Olympic Games and as prizes to poets and orators. Young lovers in ancient Greece hung wreaths on their lovers’ doorways as a sign of affection. In Rome also, laurel crowns were bestowed as a mark of honour, especially on civil officials and returning warriors. During the Italian Renaissance (c. 15th–16th centuries), the custom of wearing wreaths on festive occasions was revived. Later, in Victorian England, a floral wreath sometimes surrounded the chair of the guest of honour at a banquet.
Wreaths have traditionally had a religious significance: the writings of Greek and Roman mythology contain references to wreaths as symbols of honour; during the Middle Ages (c. 5th–15th centuries) they were often fashioned in the shape of the rosary; in 18th-century Mexico, nuns wore wreaths on their heads to signify joy on the day they professed their religious vows; the advent wreath with four candles is a Christian symbol of the four Sundays preceding Christmas.
The displaying of a decorative Christmas wreath, usually of holly leaves and berries, is a custom found in northern Europe, the United States, and Canada. It is also customary to hang a funeral wreath on a family’s door to indicate sorrow or to place a wreath of flowers at the grave site, where its circular shape signifies continuing life.
