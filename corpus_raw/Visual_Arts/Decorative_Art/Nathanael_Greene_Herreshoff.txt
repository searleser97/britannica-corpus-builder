Nathanael Greene Herreshoff,  (born March 18, 1848, Bristol, R.I., U.S.—died  June 2, 1938, Bristol), American naval architect who was recognized as the foremost yacht designer of his day and who was frequently called “the Wizard of Bristol.” Herreshoff designed and built five America’s Cup defenders: Vigilant, which won the cup in 1893; Defender, 1895; Columbia, 1899 and 1901; Reliance, 1903; and Resolute, 1920.
Herreshoff worked at the Corliss Steam Engine Company in Providence, R.I., before joining his brother John at his boat company in Bristol, where they built a variety of fast, steam-powered vessels and military craft. The Herreshoffs built the first torpedo boat for the U.S. Navy. Herreshoff’s talent for innovation found expression in both design and light-construction techniques. In 1891 he designed the 70-foot (21.3-metre) yacht Gloriana, a boat that had a waterline of 45 feet (13.7 m) and that revolutionized racing yacht design with a profile that swept easily from stemhead to the bottom of the keel.
