Ernest Gimson,  (born Dec. 21, 1864, Leicester, Eng.—died Aug. 12, 1919, Sapperton, near Cirencester), English designer of furniture, one of the Cotswold school of designers who sought to combine the traditions of rural craftsmanship with the theories and practice of William Morris.
From 1902 Gimson worked at Daneway House, Sapperton, Gloucestershire, where he was intermittently associated with the brothers Ernest and Sidney Barnsley. His work is characterized by simplicity of design and careful choice of woods. An outstanding example is the set of pews and kneeling benches (c. 1912) in St. Andrew’s Chapel, Westminster Cathedral.
