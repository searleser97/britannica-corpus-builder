Pieter de Kempeneer, also called Pedro Campaña,  (born 1503, Brussels, Burgundy [now in Belgium]—died 1580), Flemish religious painter and designer of tapestries, chiefly active in Sevilla, Spain, where he was called Pedro Campaña. By 1537 he had settled in Sevilla and apparently remained there until shortly before 1563, when he was appointed director of the tapestry factory in Brussels. His most important works are in the Sevilla cathedral—the Descent from the Cross (1547) and the Purification of the Virgin, an altarpiece with portraits of the donor and his family (1555).
