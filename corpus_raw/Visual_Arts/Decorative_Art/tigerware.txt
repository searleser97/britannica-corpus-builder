Tigerware, also spelled Tygerware,  16th- and 17th-century German stoneware having a brown, mottled glaze, and made in the Rhenish centres of Cologne and Frechen, Ger. Tigerware was imported to England and imitated there in the different medium of delft, or tin-glazed earthenware; the imitations were also called tigerware. Tin-glazed jugs in this style—called Malling jugs—are among the earliest class of English delftware. Although examples were associated with Kent (where one was excavated), it seems more likely that London was their place of manufacture.
