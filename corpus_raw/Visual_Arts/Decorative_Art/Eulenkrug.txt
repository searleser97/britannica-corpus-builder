Eulenkrüg,  south German mid-16th-century owl jugs. Few examples of this early faience are known, and they range in date from 1540 to 1561. Originating in Nürnberg, the vessels are shaped as owls, with detachable head (to be used as a cup), molded relief feathers painted in blue, and a coat-of-arms in relief on the breast, gilded and coloured. It has been suggested that Eulenkrüge might have been used as prizes in archery contests or that the owl form was a potter’s joke, a play on the Rhenish word Eulner, or Ulner (“potter”).
