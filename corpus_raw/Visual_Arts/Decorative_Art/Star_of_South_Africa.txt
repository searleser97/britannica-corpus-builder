Star of South Africa, also called the Dudley diamond,  first large diamond found in South Africa; it was discovered in 1869 on the banks of the Orange River by an African shepherd boy, who traded it to a Boer settler for 500 sheep, 10 oxen, and a horse. It weighed about 84 carats in rough form and was cut to about 48 carats. When news of its huge size reached Europe, it set off the South African diamond rush. Called the Dudley diamond after the earl of Dudley, who purchased it, it should not be confused with the much larger Star of Africa, cut from the Cullinan diamond.
