Rustic style,  in decorative arts, any ruralizing influence; more precisely, a type of furniture made of wood or metal, the main components of which are carved and fretted to resemble the branches of trees. Stemming from the idealization of nature and the “simple life” that occurred in the mid-18th century, the vogue for this kind of product persisted well into the 20th century. It was especially popular in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. It naturally endeared itself to the British Victorians, with their passion for the picturesque, and was also generally admired in the United States, where it is often termed “Adirondack furniture” after the upstate New York wilderness preserve. Cast-iron rustic furniture proliferated in the late 19th century, and the style was applied even to terra-cotta garden seats.
Rustic-style pottery and tableware (with twigs taking the place of branches) were designed to match the furniture. An analogous and even more eccentric decorative fashion that flourished for some years was the use of the horns of stags, deer, cattle, and other animals to create the main supports of chairs and tables.
