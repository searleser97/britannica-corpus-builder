Ludwigsburg ware,   faience and porcelain earthenwares made at Ludwigsburg, Württemberg (Germany), between 1736 and 1824. One of the best surviving examples of Ludwigsburg faience is a jar decorated with cold gilding and overglaze colours, now in the National Museum of Ceramics, Sèvres, France. The factory’s painted porcelain figures were more popular than its tableware, which was grayish in colour and frequently flawed. In 1776 a fine quality cream-coloured earthenware was introduced.
