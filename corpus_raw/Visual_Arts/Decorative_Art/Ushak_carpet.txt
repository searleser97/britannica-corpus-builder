Ushak carpet,  floor covering handwoven in the city of Uşak (Ushak), Turkey. By the 16th century the principal manufacture of large commercial carpets in Ottoman Turkey had been established at Uşak, which produced rugs for palace and mosque use and for export. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, this manufacture came increasingly under European control. By the close of the 19th century the carpets had become coarser and rougher, with designs calculated to please European tastes. The quality had probably never been as fine as that of the court carpets, made nearer to the capital cities.
The best-known pattern among the older carpets is a scheme of large, rounded medallions of two types, alternating upon a field of brick red or, occasionally, of dark blue. A second common pattern shows diagonal rows of eight-pointed star medallions alternating with diamonds. In the 18th and 19th centuries, a number of carpets with prayer-niche motifs in rows were made for mosque worship. Holbein rugs, Lotto carpets, and bird rugs have been attributed to Uşak, as have several prayer-rug types, including the so-called Tintorettos (so called from their resemblance to a carpet in one of his paintings, now in the Brera museum in Milan).
