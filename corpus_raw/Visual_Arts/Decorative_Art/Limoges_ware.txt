Limoges ware,   porcelain, largely servicewares, produced in Limoges, Fr., from the 18th century. Faience (tin-glazed earthenware) of mediocre quality was produced there after 1736, but the manufacture of hard-paste, or true, porcelain dates only from 1771. The manufacturers took advantage of being near Saint-Yrieix, the largest source of clay and china stone in France. In 1784 the factory was acquired as an adjunct of the Royal factory at SÃ¨vres, and the decoration of the two wares were similar. Other factories opened after 1797, and Limoges became a mass exporter of porcelain to the U.S. under the name Haviland ware, which now is produced there as well.
