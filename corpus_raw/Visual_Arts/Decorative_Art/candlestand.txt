Candlestand,  stand designed to hold a candlestick, often composed of a column rising from tripod legs and supporting a circular or polygonal tray. Stands of this type evolved from medieval metal standards. Seventeenth-century English candlestands were of oak or walnut, 3 to 5 feet (90 to 150 centimetres) tall, with twist and baluster turnings and scroll feet.
In the 18th century carved candlestands with cabriole legs were common, some of the finest being gilded. In the closing years of the century Rococo and chinoiserie designs gave way to a more severe Neoclassical style. Shaker candlestands are prized, however, for their simple elegance.
