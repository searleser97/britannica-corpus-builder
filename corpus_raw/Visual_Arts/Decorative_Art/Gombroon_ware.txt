Gombroon ware,   in Islāmic ceramics, pierced white pottery and porcelain dating from the 18th century and noted for its colourless glaze and delicate texture, seeming more like glass than porcelain. Simple patterns were inscribed in paste or punctured through the sides, while the glaze flooded the incisions. The name is taken from an English trading post in Iran (now Bandar ʿAbbās), from where the ware was shipped.
