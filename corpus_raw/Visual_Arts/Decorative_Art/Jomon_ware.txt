Jōmon ware,  Japanese Neolithic pottery dating from approximately 10,500 to roughly 300 bce, depending on the specific site. This early pottery takes its name from the impressed rope patterns (jōmon means “cord pattern”) that often decorate it. The name has come to denote not only the pottery itself but the Neolithic culture that produced it.
Because the potter’s wheel was unknown, manual methods were relied upon, particularly the coiling method—that is, preparing the clay in the shape of a rope and coiling it spirally upward. Vessels were simply heaped up and baked in open fires. In its early stages, production consisted mostly of storage jars and deep containers. They were later supplemented by pots and bowls with fantastic handles and, in addition, clay figurines called dogū.
