Samarkand rug,  handwoven floor covering that was once marketed through the ancient city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan but is actually produced by Kyrgyz or Uzbek tribeswomen or in the towns of Khotan (Hotan), Kashgar, and Yarkand in Xinjiang, China. Except for their colouring, the general effect of these rugs is more Chinese than Middle Eastern. See Kashgar rug; Khotan rug.
