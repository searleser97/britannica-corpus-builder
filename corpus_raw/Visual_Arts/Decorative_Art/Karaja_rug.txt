Karaja rug, also called Karadagh,  floor covering handmade in or near the village of Qarājeh (Karaja), in the Qareh Dāgh (Karadagh) region of Iran just south of the Azerbaijan border, northeast of Tabrīz. The best-known pattern shows three geometric medallions that are somewhat similar to those in Caucasian carpets. The central one has a latch-hooked contour and differs in colour from the others, which are eight-pointed stars.
The rugs are all wool and symmetrically knotted. Karaja runners are similar to those of Karabagh but are more Persian in appearance.
