Fire,   in gems, rapidly changing flashes of colour seen in some gems, such as diamonds. Some minerals show dispersion; that is, they break incident white light into its component colours. The greater the separation between rays of red light (at one end of the visible spectrum) and rays of violet light (at the other end), the greater the dispersion and the greater the fire, because the separate coloured rays produce this phenomenon. In properly cut gemstones with strong dispersion, white light entering through the crown will be reflected and returned through the crown as coloured light; improper cutting, however, reduces reflection and, hence, the stoneâ€™s fire.
