Ruby spinel,   natural or synthetic gem-quality spinel (q.v.; magnesium aluminum oxide) that resembles ruby. The two natural gems are generally found together in gem gravels, to the extent that spinel has been called “mother of ruby.” Many historic rubies were probably spinels; the Timur Ruby in the British crown jewels is such a stone. Spinel may be distinguished from ruby by its lesser hardness and lighter weight. Pure spinel is colourless; the gem varieties owe their hues to the presence of small proportions of metal ions other than magnesium and aluminum. Ruby spinel is the bloodred variety; balas ruby, the pink; almandine, the purple; and rubicelle, the yellow to orange red. The placer deposits of Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), and Thailand provide most of the gem material.
