Thomas W. Dyott,  (born 1771, England—died  Jan. 17, 1861, Philadelphia), British-born American patent-medicine king, glassmaker, temperance advocate, and reformer. His “picture bottles” have special value as antiques.
A druggist’s apprentice in London, Dyott arrived in Philadelphia in the 1790s almost penniless and rented a basement room where by day he polished shoes and by night manufactured shoeblack. In 1807 he opened a drugstore, added “M.D.” to his name, and soon became the largest dealer of “family medicines” in the country. Among his better-selling products were Infallible Worm Destroying Lozenges and Vegetable Nervous Cordial. As his medicines required many bottles, in 1833 he purchased the Kensington (Pennsylvania) Glass Works, where he employed 400 workers. Here he found an outlet for his Utopian ambitions. No liquor was permitted in Dyottville, or “Temperanceville,” as the factory community was called, although the “doctor’s” own medicines had a high alcoholic content. Workers rose to a daylight bell, had set times for baths, were served refreshments during breaks, and after supper and an hour’s leisure, attended night school and prayers. When the bank Dyott had established failed, he was sentenced to a short term in the penitentiary. Afterward, he returned to his drugstore and rebuilt his fortune before his death.
The Kensington output consisted of whiskey flasks, patent-medicine and pickle bottles, snuff jars, demijohns, and carboys in “bottle colours,” ranging from clear and aquamarine to dark olive, amber, and sage green. The popular and widely imitated George Washington, Jenny Lind, and Louis Kossuth bottles originated there.
