Mandarin porcelain,   ware produced in China for export in the late 18th century. It is called Mandarin because of the groups of figures in mandarin dress that appear in the decorative panels—painted mainly in gold, red, and rose pink and framed in underglaze blue—that characterize the ware. After 1800, Mandarin porcelain was often copied by English potters.
