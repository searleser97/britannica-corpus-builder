Lithophane,   biscuit, or unglazed, white porcelain decorated with a molded or impressed design, usually reproducing a painting, that was meant to be seen by transmitted light. Only a few examples were painted.
Lithophanes were produced from about 1830 to about 1900, mostly in Germany, by the Royal Factory at Berlin and by Meissen. In England the main producers appear to have been Minton and Copeland. Most lithophanes were plaques, ranging from miniatures to larger sizes that were framed and hung with the light (either natural or artificial) behind them; some examples were set in the bottom of tankards, where they could be seen when the vessel was emptied. The paintings reproduced are mostly of the sentimental Victorian kind; a list from Minton in 1850 cites as subjects a penitent, a guardian angel, and a mother with dying child.
