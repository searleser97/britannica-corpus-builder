Wing chair, also called grandfather chair, or saddle cheek chair,  a tall-backed, heavily upholstered easy chair with armrests and wings, or lugs, projecting between the back and arms to protect against drafts. They first appeared in the late 17th century—when the wings were sometimes known as “cheeks”—and they have maintained their popularity through a series of revivals ever since. Often they form part of a set, or suite.
