Etched glass,   type of glassware whose decorative design has been cut into the surface by the corrosive action of an acid. An etched-glass surface may be either rough and frosted or satiny smooth and translucent, depending largely on the composition of the glass and the amount of time the glass is exposed to the acid. Design transfer is accomplished by several methods. In one common practice, the glass is coated with a layer of beeswax or paraffin on which patterns or pictures are traced with metal needles. The glass is then dipped in hydrofluoric acid, which etches the design through the grooves made by the needles in the protective coating. Engraving and enameling are often used in conjunction with the etching process to enhance the decorative design.
