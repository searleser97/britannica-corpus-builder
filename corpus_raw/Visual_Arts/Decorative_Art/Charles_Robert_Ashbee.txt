Charles Robert Ashbee,  (born May 17, 1863, Isleworth, Middlesex, Eng.—died  May 23, 1942, Godden Green, Sevenoaks, Kent), English architect, designer, and leader of the Arts and Crafts Movement in England during the latter part of the 19th century and after.
After education at Wellington College and King’s College, Cambridge, and while actively involved in the social work of Toynbee Hall, Ashbee was articled to the architect G.F. Bodley. In 1887 Ashbee founded the School of Handicraft and in 1904 the School of Arts and Crafts, which continued its work until the outbreak of World War I. In addition, Ashbee founded the Guild of Handicraft in 1888, which produced notable works of decorative art, often to his designs, particularly in silver hollowware, jewelry, and furniture. The guild prospered through the first years of the 20th century, and, though it was dissolved in 1908, it left a permanent mark on modern design. Ashbee was also in charge of the Essex Press and was a principal in the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Buildings.
In 1900, on a trip to Chicago, Ashbee became acquainted with Frank Lloyd Wright, and, when Wright’s executed works were published in Germany (1911), the preface was written by Ashbee. After the closing of the guild, Ashbee practiced architecture. During the war years he lectured at Cairo University on English literature. From 1918 to 1922 he advised the Palestine administration on civic affairs and the preservation of buildings and monuments. Thereafter he returned to England, living the rest of his life at Godden Green.
