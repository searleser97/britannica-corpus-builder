Coving,   in architecture, concave molding or arched section of wall surface. An example is the curved soffit connecting the top of an exterior wall to a projecting eave. The curve typically describes a quarter-circle. The arched sections of a curved ceiling would be coving. Such a coved ceiling serves to join the vertical walls with a flat ceiling.
Rococo architecture exploits the angle of coving toward a potential viewer; the frequently broad surface is profusely decorated. A particularly fine example of a coved ceiling is found in the Petit Trianon, Versailles (1762â€“68), built by Ange-Jacques Gabriel.
