Argentan lace, French point d’Argentan,  lace produced in Normandy from the 17th century. The town of Argentan lies in the same lace-making area of Normandy as Alençon, and its products were for some time referred to as Alençon lace. However, technical differences, particularly in the background mesh, were distinguishable by 1724: in Argentan lace each side of every mesh was closely stitched over in buttonhole fashion, giving it a thicker or weightier look. This stitching, combined with impressively dense designs, made Argentan lace a favourite of the French court throughout the mid-18th century. In the English court too, Argentan lace was appreciated; it was used for the wedding train of Queen Charlotte in 1760, and paintings show a deep flounce of Argentan draped around her dressing table. In the late 18th century, Marie-Antoinette favoured the light Alençon laces with very simple designs. Argentan laces did not share the fashion revival of the 19th century, though the Lefebure firm of Bayeux created some noteworthy exhibition pieces.
