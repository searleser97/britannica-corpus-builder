Orvieto ware,   Italian maiolica, a tin-glazed earthenware produced originally at Orvieto, in Umbria, from the 13th century onward. It was copied from, or inspired by, the faience produced in Paterna, Spain. The most common colours of Orvieto ware are the green and manganese purple of their Spanish prototype, though sometimes blue and yellow were added. The style of decoration is Gothic, sometimes with a Middle Eastern flavour. The most common shape is that of a boccale, or jug, that has a lip characteristically large and out of proportion with its size. Orvieto ware has almost become a generic term for any pottery in this style.
