Verné rug, verné also spelled verni or verneh,  handmade Caucasian floor covering that was formerly termed a sileh. It is usually woven in two pieces joined at the middle, with a design composed of squarish compartments, usually in horizonal rows of two per panel. Within the squares are large backward S-shaped figures, representing dragons, filled with smaller Z-shaped figures. Often the field colours of the larger figures alternate from one row to the next. There is a narrow border, at times of reciprocal trefoils. Verné rugs are thought to have been woven around the town of Jebrail (Dzhebrail) in the Karabagh district of southern Azerbaijan.
These pieces are all wool, except for ivory cotton highlighting on a few pieces, and the design is formed in soumak, a form of extra weft wrapping.
