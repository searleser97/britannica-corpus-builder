Pan, Wade-Giles romanization p’an,  type of Chinese bronze vessel produced during the Shang dynasty (c. 18th–12th century bc) and, more commonly, during the Zhou dynasty (c. 1111–256/255 bc). A low bowl or pan used as a water container or for ceremonial washing, the pan was generally circular and supported on a low ring base.
The bronze pan shape had a Neolithic (c. 5000–2000 bc) pottery predecessor. Pan of the Shang dynasty had no handles, whereas those of the Zhou dynasty had two vertical handles. Occasionally, legs were attached to the base. The base and the narrow exterior surfaces of the bowl supported a limited series of decorative motifs; the broad, flat interior of the vessel was often used for a more elaborate design or for a long inscription. The yi was often mentioned together with the pan in ancient documents. While the yi was used for pouring water during washing, the pan collected the used water beneath the washing.
