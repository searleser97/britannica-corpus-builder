Hafner ware,   glazed earthenware made in Germany as early as 1350, originally as stove tiles molded in relief. The name Hafnergeschirr (“stove-maker vessel”) came to be applied to other pottery objects, usually melon-shaped or ovoid mugs or jugs, manufactured by the stove makers in the 16th century. The earliest stove tiles had a green lead glaze. By 1500 tin glazes were used; and in the mid-16th century Paul and Kunz Preuning, potters of Nürnberg, introduced a polychrome style. The large stoves made of these tiles, which are decorated with religious or allegorical subjects, are handsome works of art, as well as functional objects. Although the centre of Hafner ware manufacture was Nürnberg, the industry also spread to other places in Germany, as well as to Austria and Switzerland.
