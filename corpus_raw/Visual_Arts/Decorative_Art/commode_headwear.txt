Commode,  in dress, wire framework that was worn (c. 1690–1710 in France and England) on the head to hold in position a topknot made of ribbon, starched linen, and lace. The complete headgear was known as a “fontange,” or tower.
Supposedly, it had its beginning when a favourite of Louis XIV, whose hair had become untidy while hunting, tied it up with a garter ribbon. The admiration of the king made it a fashion with the women of the French and English courts, but the simple bow soon became a complex affair—tall, often fan-shaped, and requiring the wire support of the commode and the addition of artificial curls and dangling streamers.
