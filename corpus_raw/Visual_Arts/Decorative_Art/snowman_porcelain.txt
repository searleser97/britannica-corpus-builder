Snowman porcelain,   class of porcelain figures made at Longton Hall, Staffordshire, Eng., from c. 1750 to 1752. Called snowmen because of their thick white enveloping glaze, they include figures of human beings and animals sometimes inspired by Meissen originals. Stylistically they are more robust than some of their later, coloured counterparts.
