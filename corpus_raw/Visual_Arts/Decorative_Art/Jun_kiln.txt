Jun kiln, Pin-Yin Jun yao, or Wade-Giles Chün yao,  Chinese kiln known for the stoneware it created during the Northern Song period (960–1126) in Junzhou (now Yuzhou), in northern Henan. One class of glazed wares produced at the kiln consisted mostly of opalescent blue pieces (ranging from grayish blue to a plum colour), many strikingly splashed or mottled in purple or crimson. These glazes generally had a fine network of cracks. Another well-known class had a type of red, or flambé, glaze and was most often seen in flowerpots, bulb bowls, elegant shallow dishes, waterpots, and small boxes. During the Huizong reign of the Song dynasty, the Jun kiln produced its wares for royalty. When production increased during the Song and Yuan dynasties, techniques from the Jun kiln spread to the Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi provinces.
