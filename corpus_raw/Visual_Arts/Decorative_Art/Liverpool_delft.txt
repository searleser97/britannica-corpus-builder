Liverpool delft,   tin-glazed earthenware made from about 1710 to about 1760 in Liverpool, Eng., which, along with Bristol and London (Southwark and Lambeth), was one of the three main centres of English delftware. Some of the wares produced at Liverpool are similar to those of Bristol and London: teapots and coffeepots; sauceboats and punch bowls; tiles; puzzle jugs; and the so-called bricksâ€”rectangular blocks with holes on the top that were used as pen-and-ink stands and perhaps as flower holders. Among the wares typical of Liverpool are puzzle jugs with inscribed verses, bell-shaped mugs copied from pewter models, and trinket trays. The decoration often consists of pseudo-Chinese motifs. Two other specialties of Liverpool are shallow charpots, crudely decorated with fish, and tiles with transfer prints done by John Sadler and Guy Green, generally in black or red, though sometimes in polychrome, with subjects such as famous actors and actresses of the time.
