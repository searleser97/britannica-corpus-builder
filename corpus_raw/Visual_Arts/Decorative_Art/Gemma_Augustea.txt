Gemma Augustea, (Latin: “Gem of Augustus”)  sardonyx cameo depicting the apotheosis of Augustus. He is seated next to the goddess Roma, and both are trampling the armour of defeated enemies. It is one of the most impressive carved cameos of a series of Roman gems representing imperial persons. The Gemma Augustea (now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) was probably carved during the reign of Caligula (ad 37–41). Others in the series include the Grand Camée de France and the Blacas onyx cameo in the British Museum, London.
