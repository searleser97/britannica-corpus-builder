Epictetus,  (flourished c. 520–480? bc), Greek potter and painter who worked in Athens. His work is praised for its care, grace, vitality, delicate line, and fine draftsmanship. He signed his works as both maker and decorator.
Epictetus is most frequently mentioned in connection with a series of medallions on plates in the British Museum in London and the Cabinet des Médailles in Paris. The medallion paintings represent a “Young Man on His Horse” and a “Man” (possibly Silenus) on his way home from a banquet.
A kylix (drinking cup), found in Vulci and now in the British Museum, is signed “Python made [it]; Epictetus painted [it].” Dating from 520–510 bc, it features the paintings “Flute Player and Dancer,” on the inside, and “Heracles Slaying Busiris,” on the outside.
