Hereke carpet,  floor covering handwoven in imperial workshops founded late in the 19th century at Hereke, Turkey, about 40 miles (64 km) east of Istanbul. Large carpets and prayer rugs with pile of wool or silk were made there for palace use and for gifts presented by the sultan.
Antique carpets of various kinds were copied or patterns were created following Western fashions. Usually a tiny cartouche hidden in the design identifies the carpetâ€™s origin.
