Klismos,  light, elegant chair developed by the ancient Greeks. Perfected by the 5th century bc and popular throughout the 4th century bc, the klismos had four curving, splayed legs and curved back rails with a narrow concave backrest between them. Often illustrated on Greek pottery, the design was resurrected in the French Directoire, English Regency, and American Empire styles.
The uprights of the open chair back and the rear legs were often carved from single pieces of wood, forming graceful curves. The seat rail was generally lower than the tops of the legs, and a piece of fabric or animal skin was frequently used to upholster the seat.
A famous interpretation of the klismos form came with the chairs made in Boston, Mass., by Samuel Gragg in the opening years of the 19th century.
