Step cut, also called Trap Cut, orCushion Cut,  method of faceting coloured gemstones in which the stone produced is rather flat with steps, or rows, of four-sided facets parallel to the girdle (the stoneâ€™s widest part). Because the facets are parallel to the girdle, they are usually long and narrow, except at the corners of the stone. The angles that the main facets make with the plane of the girdle greatly affect the brilliance of the stone. Emerald, tourmaline, topaz, and amethyst are often cut in this fashion.
