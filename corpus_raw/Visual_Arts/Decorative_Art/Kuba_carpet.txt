Kuba carpet,  floor covering from the Caucasus woven in the vicinity of Kuba (now Quba) in northern Azerbaijan. Kuba carpets of the last century and a half of several major types were woven in villages centred around the towns of Perepedil, Divichi, Konaghend, Zejwa, Karagashli, and Kusary. They are as a group the most finely knotted Caucasian rugs, particularly the Perepedil, which show a highly geometrized floral design on a blue or ivory field. The Konaghend most frequently feature a large central medallion, while those rugs labeled as Karagashli usually contain isolated elements from the Persian avshan (“sprig”) or harshang (“crab”) designs. The most common type of large, red-field Caucasian soumak rug was woven in the nearby town of Kusary.
In the first half of the 20th century another group of 17th- and 18th-century rugs was thought to have been woven in Kuba. These included the Caucasian dragon rugs, which often reached nearly 20 feet (6 metres) in length. The same production centre also used geometrized Persian designs, but these rugs are now thought to have originated somewhere in the Karabagh or Genje region.
