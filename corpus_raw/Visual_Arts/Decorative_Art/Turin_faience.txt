Turin faience,   tin-glazed earthenware made in Turin, Italy, from the 16th century through the 18th. It is known that the Genoese G.G. Bianchi opened a pottery factory in Turin in 1646. In 1725 Giorgio Rossetti expanded Turinâ€™s faience industry, in which he was followed by his descendants. Another factory was that of G.A. Ardizzone (flourished 1765). These 18th-century potters produced such wares as faience plates with wavy edges and fanciful ornamental designs that were executed on white in muted tones of blue, yellow, and green.
