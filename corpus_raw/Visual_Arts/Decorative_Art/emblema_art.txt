Emblema, plural Emblemata,  central panel with figure representations—people, animals, and other objects—or occasionally another featured design motif in a Hellenistic or Roman mosaic. Emblemata were usually executed in opus vermiculatum, very fine work with tiny tesserae (stone, ceramic glass, or other hard cubes), and surrounded by floral or geometric designs in coarser mosaic work.
Although some emblemata were large scenes with several figures, most were small, vignettelike pictures, and many were portable, manufactured ready-made in trays to be set into a larger floor mosaic. The first known emblema dates from about 200 bc; by the 3rd century, emblemata had given way in Italy to an overall decoration in coarser work, but they continued in common use in the provinces until the early Christian period.
