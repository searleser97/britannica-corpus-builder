Davenport ware,   cream-coloured earthenware made by John Davenport of Longport, Staffordshire, Eng., beginning in 1793. Davenport had great success with pierced openwork-rimmed plates, either painted or transfer printed. He produced domestic bone china from 1800 and by 1810 was operating on a large scale; the business continued until 1887. Gilding, an extensive use of coloured grounds, flower-encrusted borders, brilliantly naturalistic fruit and flower decorations, and Japan patterns were favoured by Davenport on his prolific and versatile ware.
