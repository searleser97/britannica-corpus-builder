Urs Graf,  (born c. 1485, Solothurn, Switz.—died  1527, Basel), Swiss draftsman, engraver, and goldsmith, known for his drawings, woodcuts, and etchings.
The son of a goldsmith, Hugo Graf, he probably studied first under his father and later at Basel, following the style of Albrecht Dürer and of Dürer’s assistant, the German painter and draftsman Hans Baldung-Grien. Settling in Basel in 1509, Graf executed his masterpiece as a goldsmith, a reliquary of St. Bernard for the monastery of St. Urban in 1514, subsequently lost. Graf’s surviving works include 100 woodcuts, a number of engravings, etchings, and nielli (engravings inlaid with niello, a silver sulfide or mixture of sulfides), and 200 drawings, most of them dated and signed with his monogram.
Graf often accompanied Swiss mercenaries in their military adventures, and these soldiers form the main subject of his work. Graf’s drawing style is bold, energetic, and often highly ornamental. His etching “Woman Bathing Her Feet” (1513) is one of the earliest known dated etchings.
