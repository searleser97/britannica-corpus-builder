Euphronios, also spelled Euphronius,  (flourished c. 520–470 bce), one of the most celebrated Greek painters and potters of his time. He experimented with new ideas, forms, and designs within the context of the Archaic tradition, especially the adoption and exploration of the new red-figure technique. His signature has been identified on a number of vessels, 8 signed by him as painter and at least 12 as potter. Generally, Euphronios’s earlier works were signed as painter and his later works as potter.
Among the vases signed by Euphronios as painter is one of Heracles (Herakles, Hercules) wrestling Antaeus (Antaios), dated about 510–500 bce and now in the Louvre, Paris. It has been praised for its excellent drawing. A kylix (shallow earthenware cup with stem and handles), now in the State Collection of Antiquities (Staatliche Antikensammlungen) in Munich, is another example of Euphronios’s work as painter (c. 510–500 bce). A young horseman is painted on the inside of the kylix. Heracles in combat with the triple-bodied Geryon—a monster who kept large herds of cattle, the theft of which was one of Heracles’ labours—is painted on the outside.
As a potter, Euphronios worked with some of the finest vase painters of his time. The paintings of several, among them Douris, Makron, Hyakynthos, and Onesimos, have been identified on vases signed by Euphronios. Most, however, were painted by the Panaitios Painter. The Pistoxenus Painter was another of the painters of Euphronios’s pots. A white-ground cup, now in the Berlin Antiquities Collection (Antikensammlung), signed by Euphronios as potter and Pistoxenus as painter, is the last known signed work by Euphronios. In terms of its style, it could not have been made earlier than 470 bce.
