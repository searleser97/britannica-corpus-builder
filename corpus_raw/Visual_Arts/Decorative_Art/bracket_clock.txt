Bracket clock,  English spring-driven pendulum clock, more properly known as a table clock or spring clock. The earliest of these clocks, made for a period after 1658, were of architectural design, sometimes with pillars at the sides and a pediment on top; in later versions the pillars were omitted, the pediment was replaced with a domed top, and a carrying handle was added. The earliest were generally ebony-veneered, and later examples were ebonized (stained black). After about 1710, walnut veneers appeared on some, and mahogany cases became the norm after about 1760. Very few were ever made to go on wall brackets, and the term bracket clock first appeared in the 19th century.
