Faldstool,  a folding stool used by a Roman Catholic bishop when not occupying his throne in his own cathedral church, or when he is officiating outside his own church. Because the stool has no back, it can be used both for sitting and for kneeling when in prayer. By extension, the term came to mean any movable folding stool used for kneeling. A faldstool is commonly composed of two pairs of crossed legs pivoting at the intersection, with each pair joined by stretchers near ground level and by a flexible (usually fabric) seat at the top. A faldstool is provided for the use of the British sovereign at his or her coronation.
