T. Claude Ryan, in full Tubal Claude Ryan,  (born Jan. 3, 1898, Parsons, Kan., U.S.—died  Sept. 11, 1982, San Diego, Calif.), American airline entrepreneur and aircraft manufacturer who designed the plane from which Charles Lindbergh’s Spirit of St. Louis was built.
Ryan learned to fly in 1917, trained with the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1919 at Marsh Field, California, and served with the U.S. Aerial Forest Patrol until 1922. Ryan established a flight school and a business flying sightseers around San Diego and then, having formed Ryan Airlines, flew passengers between San Diego and Los Angeles (1925–27). The company moved into design and manufacture of planes, including the M-1, used to fly airmail, but Ryan left the firm in 1926. After a period of selling engines, Ryan established another company in 1929 and designed the Ryan S-T, used by the army as its basic-training plane, the PT-22. Ryan held contracts for the training of thousands of army pilots, and his company boomed throughout World War II. In the postwar slump the company produced coffins but then turned out Navion planes until the Korean War. Later the company diversified, and it was sold in 1969. Ryan founded Ryson Corporation, a design firm, with his son to build powered glider planes and planes flown by remote control.
