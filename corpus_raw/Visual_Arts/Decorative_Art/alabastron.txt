Alabastron,  elongated, narrow-necked flask, used as a perfume or unguent container. The Greek alabastron has no handles but often lugs (ear-shaped projections), sometimes pierced with string holes. There are three types of classical alabastron: a basic Corinthian bulbous shape about 3 to 4 inches (8 to 10 cm) high that appeared from the mid-7th century bc and was common in Greece; a long, pointed version found in eastern Greek, Etruscan, and Italo-Corinthian pottery; and an Attic type, from 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 cm) high, with a rounded base and occasionally two small lugs, common from the late 6th to the early 4th century bc. All three types are found in pottery form. The last two types are justifiably named alabastron, as they were made of alabaster.
Examples of alabastrons in opaque glass exist from 1000 bc in Egypt, 600 bc in Assyria, and the 2nd century bc in Syria and Palestine. The earliest Egyptian alabastron is columnar, with a palm capital and a small plinth as a stand, and is circled with wavy bands of glass thread. Later examples, in dark-blue glass or milk glass, have a funnel-shaped opening or a broad disk-lipped neck; decoration consists of scallops, festoons, or, more commonly, ringed patterns, among which combed zigzags are especially effective.
