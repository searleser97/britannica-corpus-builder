Cicim, also spelled jijim,  a ruglike spread or hanging handmade in Anatolia, composed of variously coloured strips woven in ordinary cloth weave on a narrow loom and sewn together. The patterns are usually provided by brocading while on the loom, but certain details may be embroidered later. Peculiar elements, such as feathers, may be incorporated in the brocading.
Unless silk is used in the decoration, cicims are normally all wool. The technique appears also in other parts of the Middle East.
