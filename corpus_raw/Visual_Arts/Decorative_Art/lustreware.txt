Lustreware,   type of pottery ware decorated with metallic lustres by techniques dating at least from the 9th century. One technique of Middle Eastern origin, which produced the famous Hispano-Moresque pottery in Spain and Italian and Spanish majolica, involved a multistaged process that produced a kind of staining of the ware. In a second type of lustreware, which was cheaper and less complicated, pigments containing salts of gold and platinum were used. Although inspired by the late 18th-century Spanish majolica dishes, it was an English invention that found its widest and most economical application throughout the 19th century.
Among the lustres produced in Spain were golden-greenish–tinged and tarnished-copper lustres, which in the 17th century tended to be replaced by bright-red copper lustres; in 16th-century Italy, ruby-red or golden-yellow lustres with nacreous reflections predominated. Because of a scarcity of gold during the Napoleonic Wars, most potters turned to a silver lustre that was produced with platinum chloride and was known as “poor man’s silver” for its resemblance to the more expensive Sheffield plate.
