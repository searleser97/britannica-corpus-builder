Cologne, also called Eau De Cologne,  in perfumery, scented solution usually consisting of alcohol and about 2â€“6 percent perfume concentrate. Originally, eau de cologne was a mixture of citrus oils from such fruits as lemons and oranges, combined with such substances as lavender and neroli (orange-flower oil); toilet waters were less-concentrated forms of other types of perfume. The two terms, cologne and toilet water, however, have come to be used interchangeably.
