Flannel,   fabric made in plain or twill weave, usually with carded yarns. It is napped, most often on both sides, the degree of napping ranging from slight to so heavy that the twill weave is obscured. Fibre composition and amount of napping are dependent on the intended use. Flannel is a relatively warm fabric, since still air is held in the fabric because of the napping. Addition of a man-made fibre to the blend increases the resistance to abrasion and hence may lengthen the life of the fabric. Furthermore, some of these blends help to prevent stretching, so that a better fit is maintained. Crease retention is improved with some blends such as acrylic fibre.
For outerwear, generally wool or blends with wool, or blends of man-made fibres, are used in an even-twill weave. With an all-wool flannel fabric excellent tailored garments can be produced; felting shrinkage can be prevented by blending with various man-made fibres, and washable menâ€™s suits are produced through blending wool with acrylic, nylon, or polyester fibres.
Cotton flannels are made with soft-spun filling yarns. There are various types, according to use, with many generic names; for example, flannelette, a lightweight fabric napped on one side only, and suede cloth, which has an extremely short, compact nap treated to give a smooth, flat texture.
