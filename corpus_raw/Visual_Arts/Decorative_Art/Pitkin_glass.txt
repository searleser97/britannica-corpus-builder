Pitkin glass,   a glassware originating from a glasshouse established by the Pitkin family in East Hartford (now Manchester), Conn., in 1783 and active until c. 1830.
The productâ€™s fame rests almost entirely on so-called Pitkin flasks, which were much sought by collectors in the 1920s. These flasks, which vary in colour from green to aquamarine and amber, were a kind of pocket bottle molded with a swirl or ribbed pattern. Pitkin flasks made in the Eastern glasshouses are generally olive green or amber, whereas those made in Ohio or Pennsylvania either vary from green to aquamarine or are amber and are somewhat rounder.
