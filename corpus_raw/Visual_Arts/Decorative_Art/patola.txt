Patola,  type of silk sari (characteristic garment worn by Indian women) of Gujarati origin, the warp and weft being tie-dyed (see bandhani  work) before weaving according to a predetermined pattern. It formed part of the trousseau presented by the brideâ€™s maternal uncle. Although extant patolas of Gujarat do not predate the late 18th century, their history certainly goes back to the 12th century, if not earlier.
Patterns such as a dancing girl, elephant, parrot, pipal leaf, floral spray, watercress, basketwork, diaper (overall diamond pattern) with a double outline, and flowers were employed on a deep-red ground. The extraordinary laboriousness of the work and the high cost of production led to decreased demand and the decline of this important craft. The technique of patola weaving was also known in Indonesia, where it was called ikat.
