arbor,   garden shelter providing privacy and partial protection from the weather. The name is used for a modest garden building of any material; it has been applied to examples as varied as a wrought-iron shelter at Melbourne Hall, Derbyshire, Eng., and houses constructed of pebbles, brick, or masonry. It is more correctly limited to rustic garden houses that are made up entirely of interlaced branches of growing trees and shrubs or of greenery trained over a light framework of wood or metal. If there is a distinction between an arbor and a bower, it is that the bower is an entirely natural recess whereas an arbor is only partially natural.
