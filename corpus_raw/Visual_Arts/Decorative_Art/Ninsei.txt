Ninsei, pseudonym of Nonomura Seisuke, also called Seiemon,  (flourished 17th century), Japanese potter active in Kyōto during the Edo period between the Meireki (1655–57) and the Genroku (1688–1703) eras. He learned the art of ceramics by working at the Awata-guchi kiln in Kyōto and the Seto kiln in Mino. His patron, the prince of the Ninna Temple at Omuro Katamachi, allowed him to build his kiln in front of the temple complex. He specialized in tea ceremony wares, notable for their delicate shapes and fine glaze and decorated in traditional motifs. Some of his finest works are his tea urns, or cha-tsubo.
