Brewster chair,  chair made in New England in the mid-17th century, characterized by rectilinear design and turned (shaped on a lathe) wood componentsâ€”high posts at the back terminating in decorative finials, and ornamental spindles incorporated in the back and sides. The seat was woven of rush.
The chair was named after William Brewster, a Pilgrim father. It was a heavier, more ornate spool chair than the related Carver chair.
