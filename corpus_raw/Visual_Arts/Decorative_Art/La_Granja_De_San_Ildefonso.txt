La Granja De San Ildefonso,  Spanish royal glass factory established in 1728 near the summer palace of King Philip V in San Ildefonso. The glassworkers were initially foreigners; the main stylistic influence was, as in earlier Spanish glass, that of Venice. Glass from La Granja carried on many of the classic Venetian techniques such as latticinio (threads of opaque glass embedded in clear glass). What largely distinguishes it from its Venetian counterparts, apart from less consummate technique, is the prevalence of such specifically Spanish vessel forms as the porrón, a spouted wine-drinking vessel; the cántara, a spouted water vessel; and the almorrata, a many-spouted rosewater sprinkler. The La Granja factory also made objects more generally in European use, including glass epergnes, centrepieces with multicavities, and ornamental glass baskets, sometimes embellished with opaque blue, white, or pink glass. Some of the clear glass had a grayish tinge. Wheel-engraved work also was done at La Granja.
