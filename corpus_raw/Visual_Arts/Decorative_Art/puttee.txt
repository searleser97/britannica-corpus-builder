puttee,  covering for the lower leg consisting of a cloth or leather legging held on by straps or laces or a cloth strip wound spirally around the leg. In ancient Greece a type of puttee was worn by working-class men, who wrapped irregular linen straps around their legs. The word puttee, however, is derived from the Hindu patti, meaning “bandage” or “strip of cloth.” Such puttees were first worn by members of the Anglo-Indian army in the late 19th century. During World War I they were worn by U.S. and British infantrymen.
