Chest of drawers,   type of furniture developed in the mid-17th century from a chest with drawers in the base. By the 1680s the “chest” was entirely made up of drawers: three long ones of varying depth, topped by two short ones side by side. Sometimes a flat slide with two small pull handles was included at the top, to extend the table space. Early chests of drawers were mounted on bun or ball feet or on stands with legs joined by stretchers. Drawer pulls were initially of turned wood and later of brass, with ornamental brass shields, or escutcheons, that varied in design with the fashion. Double chests, or chest-on-chests, once known as tallboys in England and highboys in America, were also made.
In the mid-18th century the rectangular lines of the chest of drawers were often modified. Beveled corners with chinoiserie, or Chinese-style, fretwork (decoration consisting of small straight bars intersecting one another at right or oblique angles) were introduced, and serpentine fronts and bowfronts became popular. A heavier version, with corner pilasters (partially projecting columns), was introduced during the Regency period, and turned wooden handles returned to favour in the Victorian period. See also commode.
