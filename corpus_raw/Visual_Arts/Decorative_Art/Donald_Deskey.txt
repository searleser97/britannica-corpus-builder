Donald Deskey,  (born Nov. 23, 1894, Blue Earth, Minn., U.S.—died  April 29, 1989, Vero Beach, Fla.), American industrial designer who helped establish industrial design as a profession.
Deskey attended the University of California at Berkeley, the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art (now San Francisco Art Institute), and the Art Institute of Chicago before studying in Paris in 1920–22. He served as director of the art department at Juniata College, Huntington, Pa., and later became the director of the industrial design department of New York University, where his work received international recognition.
About 1926, after starting his career in advertising, Deskey began to design furniture, lighting, and interiors. His inventive use of industrial materials for decorative purposes brought him acclaim and caught the attention of the Rockefeller Center, Inc., which in 1932 awarded him a large contract for the interior decoration and furnishings for Radio City Music Hall. The extraordinary results of this project helped the designer launch Donald Deskey Associates as a major consulting firm.
In addition to package and product designs for major corporations, Deskey’s firm produced a number of projects for various world’s fairs. These include structures for the New York exhibitions of 1939–40 and 1964–65, the Seattle World’s Fair of 1962, and the Confluence Theater of the U.S. Pavilion at HemisFair 1968 (held in San Antonio, Texas). His firm also designed the interiors of clubs, restaurants, and hotels in New York City. In the field of building materials, Deskey invented a high-pressure laminate known as Weldtex.
