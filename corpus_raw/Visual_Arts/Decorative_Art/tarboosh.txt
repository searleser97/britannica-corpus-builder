Tarboosh, also spelled Tarbush,  close-fitting, flat-topped, brimless hat shaped like a truncated cone. It is made of felt or cloth with a silk tassel and is worn especially by Muslim men throughout the eastern Mediterranean region either as a separate headgear or as the inner part of the turban. The tarboosh worn by women is made of rich materials and adorned with ornaments.
The tarboosh, which is of ancient Greek origin, is similar to the modern fez. As Muslim countries in the 20th century generally abolished national dress, the tarboosh was being abandoned.
