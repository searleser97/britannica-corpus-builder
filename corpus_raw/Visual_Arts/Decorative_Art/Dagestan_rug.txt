Dagestan rug,  usually small floor covering woven in the republic of Dagestan in the eastern Caucasus (Russia). Dagestan rugs are finer than the Kazakh types, but less fine than rugs from the vicinity of Kuba to the south. While many of the rugs are given the Derbent label, after a major collecting point, much of the weaving has occurred to the south in villages around Ortasal and Kasumkent.
The Dagestan rug of the 19th and early 20th century tends to favour shades of blue over red and it is more likely to be all wool than the Kuba rugs from neighbouring Azerbaijan. Edges are also more likely to be of blue wool, and the backs of many of these rugs appear ribbed. Rugs marketed under the name Zeykhur (Zeikhur) were woven in the Tabarasan district, and many show unusual qualities of colour, such as the use of pink and deep red in juxtaposition, and floral designs based on European sources.
During the mid 20th century it was common to see a type of Shirvan prayer rug, with an ivory field and lozenge-shaped compartments of stylized flowers, mislabeled as a Dagestan.
