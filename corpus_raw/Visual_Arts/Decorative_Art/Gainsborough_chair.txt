Gainsborough chair,   type of English armchair made in the mid-18th century. A wide chair with a high back, it was normally upholstered in leather. The sides are open, and the short, upholstered arms are set well back from the seat, to which they are connected by a concave curving support. The arm supports and front legs are usually fluted or carved on the front face. The contemporary name was “French chair,” a term that covered a variety of designs, the most elaborate based on French Rococo chairs of the Louis XV period.
