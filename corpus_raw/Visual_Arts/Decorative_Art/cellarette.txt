Cellarette, also spelled cellaret,  small movable cabinet designed to hold bottles of wine or liquor, primarily used from the 18th to the 20th century. It was usually kept under the centre of a sideboard or side table and rolled out for use. If it was meant to hold ice and made of silver, it was known as a wine cooler. Less commonly, a cellarette was a deep metal-lined tray with compartments for holding bottles in a sideboard.
Most portable cellarettes were made of mahogany, and designs were varied. The shape was governed to some degree by the shapes of wine bottles. Early wine bottles were short and squat, but in the late 18th century they became progressively taller, a trend that was reflected in the depth of cellarettes. Common varieties of cellarettes were circular or oval, hooped with brass bands, and provided with tapered fluted legs with casters. Under the influence of the Classical Revival of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, sarcophagus shapes were also popular.
The movable cellarette continued to be used after sideboards with built-in wine coolers were introduced in the 18th century. With the introduction of the refrigerator in the 20th century, however, use of the cellarette declined.
