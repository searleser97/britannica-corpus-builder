Verdure tapestry, also called Garden Tapestry,  type of tapestry decorated with a design based on plant forms. It is not known exactly when the first verdure tapestries were made, but, by the 16th century, tapestries with formal designs derived from foliage had become immensely popular. In the last half of the 17th century, landscapes were incorporated into their design.
Such famous tapestry factories as Aubusson and Lille in France specialized in the production of verdures, especially those of small dimensions used as upholstery and pillow covers. Verdure tapestry should not be confused with menues verdure, or millefleur tapestry, since the floral decoration of millefleur tapestries serves merely as a backdrop for the figurative elements of the design.
