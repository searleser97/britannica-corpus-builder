Boustrophedon,  the writing of alternate lines in opposite directions, one line from left to right and the next from right to left. Some Etruscan texts are written in boustrophedon style, as are some Greek ones of about the 6th century bc. The word is from the Greek boustrophēdon, meaning literally “to turn like oxen” (in plowing).
