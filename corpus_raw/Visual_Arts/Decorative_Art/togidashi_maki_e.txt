Togidashi maki-e,   in Japanese lacquerwork, kind of maki-e (q.v.). In this technique, the design is painted in lacquer, and gold or silver powder is sprinkled over it; when the lacquer is dry, another coat is applied to the design to fix the powder. Rō-iro-urushi (black lacquer without oil) is then applied over the entire surface, and, after it has dried, it is burnished briefly with charcoal, applying a little water until the gold powder is faintly revealed. Following this process (called aratogi) comes the suri-urushi process, in which raw lacquer is applied with cotton and wiped with crumpled rice paper; a finishing burnish (shiage togi) is then done with charcoal. Next, granular charcoal is applied with water, using a soft cloth, and gently polished. Finally, suri-urushi and polishing is repeated three times.
The earliest extant example of togidashi maki-e is found on the scabbard of a Chinese T’ang-style sword of the Nara period (645–794), owned by the Shōsō-in in Nara. In the Heian period (794–1185), togidashi maki-e lacquer ware flourished. From the Muromachi period (1338–1573), the technique was combined with high relief (takamaki-e), and the ware was called shishiai togidashi maki-e.
