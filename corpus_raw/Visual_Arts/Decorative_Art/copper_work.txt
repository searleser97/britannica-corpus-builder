Copper work,   tools, implements, weapons, and artwork made of copper. Copper’s discovery precedes recorded history, and it was the first metal that was used in fashioning tools and weapons. Its use dates at least from 4000 bc in Chaldea, and perhaps earlier. Although bronze, and later iron, became the preferred material for weapons and tools, copper found wide uses in such wares as cooking vessels, household utensils, mirrors, and ornaments. Although unsuited for casting, copper is malleable and readily worked by hammering, chasing, engraving, and cold-rolling. Copper work was often further ornamented by gilding, enamelling, or applying precious stones. From the 8th century, gilded copper was frequently used for liturgical vessels, the characteristic reddish colour of the copper imparting a deeper gold colour to the gilt. The use of gilded copper in Europe reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries—primarily in jewelry and ornamental objects. More utilitarian uses of copper work in common housewares grew out of the lower cost of copper than of brass and other metals. The excellent qualities of copper utensils continue to be appreciated in modern times, especially in such items as copper pots and pans.
In the 18th century, Sheffield plate was developed, in which thin sheets of silver are fused to copper plate and then formed into the desired object. Sheffield plate enjoyed immediate popularity not only because of the lower cost of silver-plated copper but also because Sheffield plate was designed and fashioned in most of the popular designs of solid silver.
