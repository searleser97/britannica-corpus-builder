Ding ware, Wade-Giles romanization ting,  Chinese glazed stoneware produced for many centuries, beginning in the 8th century ad.
Usually white in colour, Ding ware is either plain or decorated with incised, molded, impressed, or carved designs, among which the phoenix, lily, and peony are popular. The most important types of Ding ware are bai Ding (“white” Ding), fen Ding (“flour” Ding), and tu Ding (“earthen” Ding), and characteristic forms include bowls, cups, and dishes. Fired upside down, many pieces of Ding ware, especially bowls, have an unglazed rim banded with metal.
Ding ware was particularly popular during the Song dynasty (ad 960–1279) at Dingzhou (in present Quyang Xian, Hebei province) and, after the court’s transfer to the south in 1127, near Jingdezhen.
