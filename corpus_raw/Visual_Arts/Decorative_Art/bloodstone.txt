Bloodstone, also called heliotrope,  dark-green variety of the silica mineral chalcedony that has nodules of bright-red jasper distributed throughout its mass. Polished sections therefore show red spots on a dark-green background, and from the resemblance of these to drops of blood it derives its name. Bloodstone was greatly prized in the Middle Ages and was used in sculptures representing flagellation and martyrdom; it later became of small importance. Notable occurrences include the Kāthiāwār Peninsula, India. Its physical properties are those of quartz (see silica mineral [table] ).
