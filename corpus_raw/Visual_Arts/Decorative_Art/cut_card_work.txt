Cut-card work,   technique for decorating silver objects, generally cups, bowls, or coffeepots, in which thin sheets of silver that have previously been cut into outline designs are soldered to the object, creating a relief and silhouette effect. The cards are usually cut and pierced into leaf shapes, which are often embellished with beadwork in imitation of the stems. Otherwise, they are unadorned. Besides providing decoration, cut-card work adds strength to the vessel. Sometimes a row of slats, often in the shape of spoon handles that have been soldered around the object and then finely chased or engraved, is mistakenly called cut-card work. This is not a true example of the craft, as cut-card is always finished before application.
The technique originated in France and spread to other European countries and North America largely through the movement of Huguenot craftsmen. It was popular in England from about 1660 until the early 18th century.
