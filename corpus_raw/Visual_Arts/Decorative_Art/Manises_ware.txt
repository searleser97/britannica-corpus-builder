Manises ware,   in ceramics, a style that evolved at Manises, Spain, in the 14th and 15th centuries. It combined Arabic and Christian Gothic influences, the former evident in rhythmic drawing, the latter in representing heraldic animals and foliage. The eagle of St. John and Spanish and Italian armorial emblems were favourite subjects.
