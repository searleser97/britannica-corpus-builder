Yashmak, also spelled Yașmak,  long, narrow face screen or veil traditionally worn in public by Muslim women. The yashmak can consist of a piece of black horsehair attached near the temples and sloping down like an awning to cover the face, or it can be a veil covered with pieces of lace, with slits for the eyes, tied behind the head by strings and sometimes supported over the nose by a small piece of gold, ivory, or silver.
The yashmak is usually worn with an enveloping garment most frequently called a chador. The custom of wearing the costume is centuries old, but in the 20th century it was slowly abandoned except in the most traditional Islāmic societies. Its use spread once again late in the 20th century owing to the resurgence of Islām in Middle Eastern and other countries.
