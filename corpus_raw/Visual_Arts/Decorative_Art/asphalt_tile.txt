Asphalt tile,   smooth-surfaced floor covering made from a mixture of asphalts or synthetic resins, asbestos fibres, pigments, and mineral fillers. It is usually about 1/8 or 3/16 inch (about 3 mm or 4.8 mm) thick, and is nonporous, nonflammable, fairly low in cost, and easily maintained.
Asphalt tile was developed for damp and alkaline conditions where linoleum did not fare well. It is resistant to fungal attack, mild acids, and oils and grease, and it can be used where floor temperature is less than 80° F (27° C).
