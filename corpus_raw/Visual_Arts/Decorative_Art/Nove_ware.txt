Nove ware,   primarily majolica, or tin-glazed earthenware, made in Nove, Italy, in the 18th century. The factory was founded by Giovanni Battista Antonibon in 1728, and in the latter part of the century it had connections with a factory in nearby Bassano, where majolica had been made two centuries earlier. Most Nove ware was in the prevalent Rococo style. From 1752 the factory also produced a porcelain painted with deep reds and yellowish greens. Nove also produced a fine-quality cream-coloured earthenware (terra inglese).
