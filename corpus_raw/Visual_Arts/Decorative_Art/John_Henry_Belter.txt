John Henry Belter, original name Johann Heinrich Belter,  (born 1804,  Hilter, near Osnabrück [Germany]—died  Oct. 15, 1863, New York, N.Y., U.S.), cabinetmaker and designer known for his superb Victorian Rococo pieces.
Belter served as a cabinetmaker’s apprentice in Württemberg (now in Germany), where he was trained in the Black Forest tradition of rich carving so admired during the 19th century. Settling in New York City in 1833, he married and opened a fashionable shop on Broadway. Although he also worked in walnut and mahogany, his favourite material was rosewood (then popular in the United States), with which he experimented. In 1856 he received one of a total of four patents for his method of processing laminated rosewood in many layers to achieve thin panels that, once shaped in molds through steam heating, were finely carved. This rather personal Louis XV revival style, a somewhat heavy, florid Rococo called zweites Rokoko, succeeded the uniquely Neoclassical and functional Biedermeier period created in his homeland (and the Empire style imported by Duncan Phyfe to New York) and reflected the more nostalgic tastes then evolving in Europe.
The large factory Belter opened in New York City in 1858 employed many apprentices; and his furniture became known for its rich carving, handsome brocades, and bold asymmetry. Competitive French imports that were esteemed by the elite, together with economic problems attending the American Civil War (1861–65), impaired his business; production continued for a while after his death, but the firm failed completely in 1867.
