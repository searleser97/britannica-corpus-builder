Act of Parliament clock, also called tavern clock,  weight-driven wall clock with a large wooden, painted or lacquered dial. More correctly, it is called a tavern clock. Clocks of this type were displayed by innkeepers and got their name from the passage of a five-shilling duty on clocks in Great Britain, introduced in 1797 by the English prime minister William Pitt the Younger. (Many clocks were disposed of by their owners, who consequently relied more on clocks in public places, and the effect on the clock-making industry was so disastrous that the act was repealed the following year.) Actually, these clocks were first made before the mid-18th century and were in use in servantsâ€™ quarters of large houses as well as taverns.
