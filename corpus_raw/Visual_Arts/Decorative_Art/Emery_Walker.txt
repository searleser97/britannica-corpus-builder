Sir Emery Walker,  (born April 2, 1851, London—died July 22, 1933, London), engraver and printer associated with the revival of fine printing in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Walker’s formal schooling ended when he was 13. From 1873 to 1883 he was employed by the Typographic Etching Company in London, whose founder had developed the first commercial application in England of photoengraving. During that decade Walker developed a profound understanding of the history and processes of printing. In 1886 he joined Walter Boutall in a partnership that was the beginning of a prominent engraving and printing firm.
Walker met the poet William Morris in 1883; both men were deeply interested in fine typography. A talk given by Walker in 1888 before the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, London, inspired Morris’s printing activities and led to the establishment of the Kelmscott Press (1891), considered the beginning of the private press movement in England. Walker played an important role in all its activities throughout the seven years of its existence.
In 1900 Walker and Thomas James Cobden-Sanderson founded the Doves Press, known for its special type based on that of Nicolas Jenson and for its outstanding editions, particularly the Doves Bible, 5 vol. (1903–05), in which the special type was used. The partnership ended in 1909. Walker also played a role in creating type for two other notable private presses: the Ashendene Press and the Cranach-Presse, Weimar, Germany. He was knighted in 1930.
