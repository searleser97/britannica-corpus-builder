Bīdrī ware,   metal decorative objects ornamented with a type of Indian inlay work. The ware derives its name from the town of Bīdar, in Karnātaka, though it is not made exclusively in that town; Lucknow and Murshidābād are also very important centres of Bīdrī manufacture.
The metal commonly used is an alloy composed mostly of zinc with a small amount of copper, darkened to achieve a black colour that does not fade. There are two main types of Bīdrī work. In the first type, the pattern is deeply incised, then silver or gold is cut to the exact size, the shape of the incised pattern is embedded in the incision, and the surface is finally smoothed and polished. In the second, encrusted type, the outline of the design is engraved and shaped gold or silver leaf affixed after the cavities have been filled with lead.
Bīdrī ware generally consists of hookah bases, dishes, cups, vases, jars, and spice boxes. The commonest patterns are diapers (overall diamond patterns) and a variety of floral sprays, leaves, fishes, and lozenges. Ambitious large works are no longer attempted, modern production chiefly consisting of cigarette cases, ashtrays, and jewelry.
