Rolltop desk,  desk with a sliding roll top, or tambour, that encloses the working surface of the upper part and can be locked. The portion of the desk that gives the form its name is constructed of narrow slats of wood glued to some flexible material, the slats running along slides or grooves fitted into the upper edges of the desk.
First introduced into England from France in the late 18th century, the rolltop desk had become a standard piece of office equipment by the end of the 19th century and was mass-produced in large quantities. Its popularity waned, however, with the development of Bauhaus-inspired modernist furniture, only to reappear in the 1960s with George Nelson’s “action office” and again in the 1980s as a “country antique.”
