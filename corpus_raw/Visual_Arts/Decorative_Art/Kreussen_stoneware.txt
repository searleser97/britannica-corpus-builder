Kreussen stoneware,   German salt-glazed stoneware produced at Kreussen, in Bavaria, from the late 16th century until c. 1730â€“32. Squat tankards with pewter lids, four- or six-sided flasks (Schraubflaschen), and pear- or globular-shaped jugs were primarily produced; the best of these date from the 17th century. The stoneware is grayish-red, covered with a brown salt glaze. Decoration consists of plain applied reliefs, applied reliefs painted in bright opaque overglaze colours of blue, red, green, yellow, white, and occasionally gold, or plain surfaces with figures painted in the same overglaze colours. The earliest known example decorated with overglaze colours is dated 1622. Until this time painting pottery in overglaze colours had never been done in Europe; and, in all likelihood, the technique was learned from contemporary German and Bohemian glass enamelers. Decorative themes include the Apostles, the imperial electors, hunting scenes, the planets, and commemorations of families and marriages.
