Cluny guipure,   French bobbin lace first made in the mid-19th century. It is called Cluny because it was inspired by examples of 16th- and 17th-century scalloped lace with geometric patterns displayed in the Cluny Museum, Paris. Cluny guipure was made from about 1862 in Lorraine. It was also made in England (at Nottingham) and at many centres in Belgium, including Bruges, Ypres, and Courtrai.
