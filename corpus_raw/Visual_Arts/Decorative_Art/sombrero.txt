sombrero,  broad-brimmed high-crowned hat made of felt or straw, worn especially in Mexico and the southwestern United States. The sombrero, its name derived from the Spanish word sombra, meaning “shade,” first appeared in the 15th century. Gentlemen often wore tan, white, or gray felt sombreros, while peasants wore straw.
In Mexico the brim of the sombrero could be as much as 2 feet (60 cm) wide. Adopted by ranchers and frontiersmen in the United States, the sombrero was modified into the cowboy hat.
