Schleswig faience,   tin-glazed earthenware made from 1755 to 1814 at the town of Schleswig in the Danish duchy of Schleswig (now the Land [state] of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany). The faience factory was set up by Johann Christian Ludwig von Lücke, a German artist-potter from Meissen, Saxony. Several well-known painters of pottery worked at Schleswig, including Georg Heinrich Giessler, from Strålsund, and Abraham Leihamer.
Schleswig faience, with its relief molding, resembles the style of Strålsund. Like other pottery made in the Baltic region, it was painted sometimes in underglaze colours (purplish black predominating) and at other times in overglaze colours.
