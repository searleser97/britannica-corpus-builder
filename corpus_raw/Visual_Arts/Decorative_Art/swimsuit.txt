Swimsuit, also called bathing suit,  garment designed for wearing while swimming. Sea bathing became popular in the mid-19th century when railroads first made it possible for people to get to the beach for their vacations. The first swimsuits concealed most of the body: women wore bloomers, black stockings, and a dress with short sleeves and skirt; men wore a dark-coloured, one-piece, sleeveless garment reaching to the ankles or knees. By the early 20th century, however, men had begun to wear shorts without a top. As early as 1900 Annette Kellerman, an Australian swimmer, wore a loose, one-piece wool bathing suit that by about 1910 became generally acceptable for the public. A clinging one-piece swimsuit for women was introduced in France after World War I, and other swimsuit accessories were abandoned.
In about 1935 women began to wear a two-piece suit consisting of a top and shorts. In 1947 the bikini, consisting of an abbreviated top and brief pants, came into fashion. Modern womenâ€™s swimsuits vary in style from one- or two-piece garments to suits with skirts, but to facilitate swimming they are made of fabrics that do not sag or balloon in the water.
