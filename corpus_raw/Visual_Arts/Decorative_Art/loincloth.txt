Loincloth,  usually, a rectangular piece of cloth draped around the hips and groin. One of the earliest forms of clothing, it is derived, perhaps, from a narrow band around the waist from which amuletic and decorative pendants were hung. From about 3000 bce Egyptians wore a loincloth (schenti) of woven material that was wrapped around the body several times and tied in front or belted. Sometimes the schenti was pleated or partially pleated and sometimes stiffened to project in front.
Cretan loincloths from around 2000 bce were highly patterned and decorated. Loincloths were still worn in the 20th and 21st centuries in some tropical and subtropical areas of the world.
