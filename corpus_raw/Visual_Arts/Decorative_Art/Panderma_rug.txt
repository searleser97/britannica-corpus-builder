Panderma rug,  any of several types of floor coverings handwoven at Panderma (now BandÄ±rma), a town in Turkey on the southern shore of the Sea of Marmora, usually as imitations of Ghiordes prayer-rug designs. The enterprise was begun early in the 20th century, perhaps with weavers from Ghiordes, though it is usually described as an Armenian establishment.
Panderma imitations are usually more exuberant in their draftsmanship than are the originals, with overelaboration of some areas, such as the sides of the prayer-niche design, and a differing colour range, including pastel shades and opaline effects. As in less plausible counterfeits made elsewhere, there may be a general hardness of effect, in contrast with the true Ghiordes products.
