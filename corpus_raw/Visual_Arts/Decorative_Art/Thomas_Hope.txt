Thomas Hope,  (born 1769, Amsterdam, Neth.—died  Feb. 3, 1831, London, Eng.), English author and furniture designer who was a major exponent of the Regency style of English decorative arts.
Hope was a member of a rich banking family that had emigrated from Scotland to Holland. During his youth he studied architecture and traveled extensively in Mediterranean countries, the probable source of his passion for classical art and architecture. He settled in London about 1796 and in 1807 purchased Deepdene, the country house in Surrey that he decorated and furnished in the Regency style. Included in its furnishings were statues executed by John Flaxman, a leading English Neoclassical sculptor, and an Egyptian sofa and chair now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.
Hope’s major work on interior design is Household Furniture and Interior Decoration (1807; facsimile ed., 1937), which influenced the Neoclassical movement. He also wrote The Costumes of the Ancients (1809) and Designs of Modern Costume (1812). His most popular work was the novel Anastasius; or, Memoirs of a Greek Written at the Close of the Eighteenth Century (1819). He also wrote on philosophy and architecture.
