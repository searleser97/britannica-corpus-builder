Velvet,   in textiles, fabric having a short, dense pile, used in clothing and upholstery. The term derives from the Middle French velu, “shaggy.” Velvet is made in the pile weave, of silk, cotton, or synthetic fibres, and is characterized by a soft, downy surface formed by clipped yarns. The wrong side of the fabric is smooth and shows the weave employed.
Velvets can be made water-repellent and crush-resistant. They are also occasionally patterned or embossed.
