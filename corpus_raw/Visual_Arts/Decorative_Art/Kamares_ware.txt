Kamáres ware,  style of painted pottery associated with the palace culture that flourished on Crete during the Middle Minoan period (c. 2100–c. 1550 bc). Surviving examples include ridged cups, small, round spouted jars, and large storage jars (pithoi), on which combinations of abstract curvilinear designs and stylized plant and marine motifs are painted in white and tones of red, orange, and yellow on black grounds.
