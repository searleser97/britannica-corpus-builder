Lavaliere,   ornament hung from a chain worn around the neck. The lavaliere, which came into fashion in the 17th century, was usually a small, jewelled gold locket, though it could also be an enamelled locket or pendant.
The lavaliere was named for the Duchesse de La Vallière, the mistress of Louis XIV in the 1660s. The term was sometimes also used during the Third Republic in France to describe a man’s silk scarf that was worn loosely knotted with long hanging ends.
