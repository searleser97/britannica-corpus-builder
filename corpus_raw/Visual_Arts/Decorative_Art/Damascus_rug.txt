Damascus rug,  usually small floor covering, often attributed to Damascus, Syria, in the 16th or 17th century in continuation of the rug art of the Mamlūk rulers of that land. The usual Damascus field pattern is a grid of small squares or rectangles (hence the European term chessboard carpets), each of which includes a hexagon or octagon filled with tiny radial motifs that surround a star interlace. Among the other field patterns that occur is a large one with several medallions.
The material is thought to be goat hair throughout. These rugs, like the Mamlūk and Ottoman carpets of Egypt, were made with the asymmetrical knot.
