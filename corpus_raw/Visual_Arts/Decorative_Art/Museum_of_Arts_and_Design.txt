Museum of Arts & Design (MAD), formerly called (1956–86) Museum of Contemporary Crafts and (1986–2002) American Craft Museum,  museum in New York, N.Y., dedicated to the collection and exhibition of contemporary works and objects made from clay, glass, wood, metal, and fibre. It emphasizes craft, art, and design but is also concerned with the broader subjects of architecture, fashion, interior design, industrial design, performing arts, and technology.
The museum’s history dates to 1942, when American craft benefactor Aileen Osborn Webb founded the American Craftmen’s Council to recognize and promote contemporary crafts in an age of machine manufacturing. Through the efforts of the council and Webb, the Museum of Contemporary Crafts was born, becoming the American Craft Museum in 1986, when it moved to new headquarters. As the museum grew and evolved, its scope broadened, and its current name is intended to reflect its broader interdisciplinary collection and interest. MAD’s permanent collection includes more than 2,000 objects, which trace the history of the art and design field from the mid-20th century to the present day. The collection stresses the interconnectivity of the creative arts, from common materials and technical approaches to the creative process itself. The museum’s exhibits reflect its eclectic interests, with items ranging from jewelry, silverware, and clothing to furniture and architectural installations. The majority of the collection is given over to American artists, though there are also significant examples from across the globe.
In 2008 the museum relocated to a newly constructed facility at Columbus Circle in New York City. The new building features an opulent terra-cotta exterior.
