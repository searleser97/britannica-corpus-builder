Coronation Carpet,  17th-century Persian court-loomed floor covering, 12 feet 2 inches × 17 feet 1 inch (371 × 521 cm). It is made of silk pile with parts of the field covered in gilded silver strips wound around a silk core, leaving a gold ground and an overall pattern of flowers, cloud bands, and arabesques.
It belongs to the Danish crown and remains in a perfect state of preservation, having been used only at coronations, beginning with that of Frederick IV in 1700. It is on display at Rosenborg Palace in Copenhagen.
