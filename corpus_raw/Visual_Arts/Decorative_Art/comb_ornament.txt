Comb,  a toothed implement used for cleaning and arranging the hair and also for holding it in place after it has been arranged. The word is also applied, from resemblance in form or in use, to various appliances employed for dressing wool and other fibrous substances, to the indented fleshy crest of a rooster, and to the ridged series of cells of wax filled with honey in a beehive.
Hair combs are of great antiquity, and specimens made of wood, bone, and horn have been found in Swiss lake dwellings. Among the Greeks and Romans they were made of boxwood and in Egypt also of ivory. For modern combs the same materials are used, as well as tortoiseshell, metal, and, most often, synthetic plastic materials.
