Nürnberg faience,   German tin-glazed earthenware made at Nürnberg between 1712 and 1840. It is among the earliest German faience produced, since Nürnberg was a centre of pottery manufacture as early as the 16th century. The few extant specimens from that early period are in the manner of contemporary Italian maiolica.
