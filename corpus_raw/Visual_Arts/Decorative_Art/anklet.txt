Anklet,   in jewelry, bracelet worn around the ankle. Ornamental anklets have been worn for centuries, particularly in the East. Jewelry found in Persia and dating from the end of the 2nd millennium to the 7th century bc includes anklets, some decorated with animals such as an ibex with curving horns. Anklets are still common in India, where they are sometimes adorned with jewels and bells and often hollowed and filled with shot, so as to jangle rhythmically when worn by dancers.
