Cockfighting chair,   chair with broad armrests that form a yoke with the back rail, to which a reading desk is attached. Broad in front but curving inward toward the back, the seat was shaped so that a reader could easily sit astride, facing the desk at the back of the chair and resting his arms on the ends of the yoke.
Because such chairs were shown in illustrations of cockfights, it was thought for a time that they were made for this purpose. More correctly called reading chairs, they were first made in England for libraries in the early 18th century.
