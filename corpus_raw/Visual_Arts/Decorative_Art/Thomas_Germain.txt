Thomas Germain,  (born 1673, Paris, France—died  Aug. 14, 1748, Paris), French silversmith, perhaps the best-known member of a distinguished family of silversmiths.
The son of Pierre Germain, he studied painting as a boy under Louis Boullogne the Younger. About 1688 he was sent to Rome, where in 1691 he became apprenticed to an Italian silversmith. Soon he was employed as one of the artists on the altar of St. Ignatius for the Church of the Gesù. Other commissions followed, and from 1697 he was an independent silversmith. By 1706 he was back in France, where he was active until the 1720s on church commissions. Among such works was a silver-gilt monstrance (vessel to contain the Host) for Notre Dame in Paris, commissioned in 1716. He became a master in the guild in 1720, and in 1722 he made a silver-gilt sun (destroyed in 1790) for the coronation of Louis XV. Germain was granted apartments in the Louvre in 1723, when he was a royal goldsmith. From then until his death he was particularly active in making such objects as covered dishes, candlesticks, sconces, and plates for the king. He also produced numerous objects for special occasions, such as gold rattles on the birth of royal children. Although he is best known for flamboyantly elaborate objects in the Rococo style, some of his pieces were simple and elegant.
Germain also had foreign patrons, including the elector of Cologne, the king of Portugal, the queen of Spain, and the king and queen of Naples. The Portuguese court was particularly important: during the 40-year period beginning in 1728 some 3,000 silver works are believed to have been made by the Germain workshop for the palace in Lisbon. For a wealthy Portuguese nobleman, the duke of Alveiro, he executed in 1730 an exceptionally fine surtout de table (table centrepiece), ornately decorated with cupids, hounds, and hunting horns.
Also active in the political life of Paris, Germain was elected a city councillor and alderman in 1738 and reelected in 1741. At his own expense he designed and built a small church, Saint-Louis du Louvre (consecrated 1744; destroyed in 1810), where he was buried.
