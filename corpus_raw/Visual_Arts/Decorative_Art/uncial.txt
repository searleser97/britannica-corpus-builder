Uncial,  in calligraphy, ancient majuscular book hand characterized by simple, rounded strokes. It apparently originated in the 2nd century ad when the codex form of book developed along with the growing use of parchment and vellum as writing surfaces. Unlike its prototype square roman, uncial is adapted to direct strokes of the pen held in one position and was thus the natural favourite of scribes; most of the works of Latin literature for more than 500 years were copied in this hand.
Half uncial, or semi-uncial, script developed through the scribesâ€™ tendency in certain schools, such as the Insular script of the British Isles, to adopt more cursive forms, admitting ascenders and descenders.
