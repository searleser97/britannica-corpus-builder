Longquan ware, Wade-Giles romanization Lung-ch’üan,  celadon stoneware produced in kilns in the town of Longquan (province of Zhejiang), China, from the Song to the mid-Qing dynasties (roughly from the 11th to the 18th century).
Early Longquan celadons had a transparent green glaze that was superb in quality, thick, and viscous, usually with a well-marked network of fine cracks. The most frequent surviving examples are large dishes, for which there was a thriving export trade; this popularity was in part because of the superstition that a celadon dish would break or change colour if poisoned food were put into it. Bowls and large vases were also sometimes made with this glaze. Decoration of Longquan ware was usually incised but could also be molded. The heavier varieties were intended to withstand the rigours of transport to overseas markets. The finer surviving wares are the rarest and often the oldest.
