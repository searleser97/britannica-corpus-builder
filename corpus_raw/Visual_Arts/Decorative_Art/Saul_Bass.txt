Saul Bass,  (born May 8, 1920, Bronx, New York, U.S.—died April 25, 1996, Los Angeles, California), American graphic designer and filmmaker who introduced a new art form with his imaginative film title sequences that conveyed the essence of a movie and prepared audiences for what they were about to see.
Bass was a creative child who enjoyed drawing. After completing high school, he studied at the Art Students League in New York City and later attended Brooklyn College, where he was taught by the notable designer Gyorgy Kepes. He worked as an advertising designer before moving to Los Angeles in 1946.
Bass continued to do graphic design for advertising and by 1952 was able to set up his own practice. He began his association with Hollywood by designing advertising posters for movies. His poster for Carmen Jones (1954) so impressed its director, Otto Preminger, that he asked Bass to also create the movie’s opening credits. It was the animated opening sequence that he created for Preminger’s The Man with the Golden Arm (1955) that made Bass’s reputation. His other well-known title sequences included those for Around the World in 80 Days (1956); Preminger’s Bonjour Tristesse (1958), Anatomy of a Murder (1959), and Exodus (1960); the Alfred Hitchcock films Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), and Psycho (1960); Spartacus (1960); West Side Story (1961); and Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), and Casino (1995).
Bass also created iconic logos for the American Bell Telephone Company, AT&T, Continental Airlines, Girl Scouts of America, and Quaker Oats, among others. In addition to his design work, Bass directed the sci-fi thriller feature film Phase IV (1974) and wrote, produced, and directed several short films. His Why Man Creates (1968) won the Academy Award for best short-subject documentary.
