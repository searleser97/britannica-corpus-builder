Fluorescence photography,   process that records the glow or visible light given off by certain substances when they are irradiated by ultraviolet rays. The exclusively ultraviolet irradiation is accomplished by means of a filter at the light source; another filter, placed over the camera lens, absorbs the reflected ultraviolet rays, permitting only the visible light (fluorescence) from the object itself to be recorded on the film. Normal lenses and either black-and-white or colour film are used.
Fluorescence photography can identify dyes, stains, and markings, specific chemical substances, and fluorescent components in microscope specimens.
