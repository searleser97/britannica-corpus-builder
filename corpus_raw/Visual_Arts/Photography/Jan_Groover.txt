Jan Groover,  (born April 24, 1943, Plainfield, New Jersey, U.S.—died January 1, 2012, Montpon-Ménestérol, France), American photographer who experimented with space and illusion in large-format still-life tableaux that featured everyday objects, particularly kitchen utensils arranged in a sink. She was probably best remembered for her conceptualist works: colour diptychs and triptychs depicting street photography, notably the whizzing by of vehicles in a brief span of time.
Groover studied painting at the Pratt Institute, New York City (B.F.A., 1965), and the Ohio State University (M.F.A., 1970), but she turned to photography in 1971. After winning (1978) a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, she purchased her first large-format camera. Groover was influenced by the works of 14th- and 15th-century still-life masters as well as those of Paul Cézanne and Giorgio Morandi and by the stop-action imagery of British photographer Eadweard Muybridge. She taught for more than a decade at the State University of New York and counted among her pupils Gregory Crewdson, who also became known for his elaborately staged photographs.
A retrospective of her works was held in 1987 at the Museum of Modern Art, New York City. In 1991 Groover and her husband, painter Bruce Boice, became disenchanted with American politics and moved to France, where she used an even larger camera to capture images of churches, graveyards, and landscapes.
