Josef Koudelka,  (born January 10, 1938, Boskovice, Moravia, Czechoslovakia [now Czech Republic]), Czech-born French photographer known best for his black-and-white images of Europe’s itinerant Roma people.
Koudelka graduated from the Czech Technical University in Prague in 1961 with a degree in aeronautical engineering. He pursued a career in engineering but was also an active amateur photographer, having been introduced to the medium as a teenager. His photographs from the early to mid-1960s include the Prague theatre for the magazine Divadlo (“Theatre”) and the Roma people (Gypsies) of Czechoslovakia. The Roma became a lifelong interest for Koudelka, who was drawn to their music and culture. He spent extended periods living with them. The more time Koudelka spent with the Roma, the more nomadic and simple his own life became. By 1967 he had abandoned his engineering career to pursue photography full-time.
When the Soviets led an invasion of Warsaw Pact troops into Czechoslovakia in 1968, Koudelka documented the chaos as it unfolded in Prague. He smuggled his photographs out of the country and published them anonymously, credited to P.P. (“Prague Photographer”), in order to protect himself and his family. (He did not publish them with his name until 1984, after his father died.) Though lacking a named photographer, the series was recognized by the Overseas Press Club’s Robert Capa Gold Medal (1969), awarded for the best published photographic reporting from abroad. Koudelka was granted asylum in England in 1970. Soon after, he joined the Magnum Photo Agency.
Though he officially became a French citizen in 1987, Koudelka spent his life traveling and photographing disappearing landscapes and lifestyles, often capturing vast expanses in panoramic format. He also photographed destruction, chaos, and war wrought during the fall of the Berlin Wall and its aftermath (1988–91) and the war and its aftermath in Beirut (1991). He was the recipient of many awards and honours such as the French Prix Nadar (1978), the Grand Prix National de la Photographie (1989), the Henri Cartier-Bresson Award (1991), the Hasselblad Prize (1992), a Centenary Medal from the Royal Photographic Society (1998), and the International Center of Photography Infinity Award (2004). He became a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in 1992. Koudelka produced numerous books, including Gypsies (1975), Exiles (1988), Black Triangle (1994), and Chaos (1999).
