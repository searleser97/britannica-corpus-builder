Timothy O’Sullivan,  (born c. 1840, New York, New York, U.S.—died January 14, 1882, Staten Island, New York), American photographer best known for his Civil War subjects and his landscapes of the American West.
O’Sullivan was an apprentice at Mathew Brady’s daguerreotype studio in New York City at the time the Civil War broke out. During the Civil War he photographed on many fronts as part of the team sent out by Brady and later as a photographer for Alexander Gardner, who published O’Sullivan’s photographs as part of his Photographic Sketch Book of the Civil War (1866). Like Gardner, O’Sullivan left Brady’s employ over the issue of receiving proper credit for his work. In works such as A Harvest of Death (1863), which shows the Confederate dead at Gettysburg, O’Sullivan moved beyond traditional war images, which usually portrayed armies at rest, to capture instead the grim and gruesome realities of armed warfare.
After the war O’Sullivan often portrayed vast landscapes. From 1867 to 1869 he was the official photographer of Clarence King’s United States Geological Exploration of the 40th Parallel, taking photos of mines and geologic sites, and in 1870 he acted as photographer for a team that went to Panama in search of a canal route. In 1871, 1873, and 1874 he was associated with a series of surveys in the southwestern United States, during which he created powerful, carefully composed images of sweeping landscapes. During this time he also photographed Native Americans whom he met during his travels, portraying them with gravity and a deep sense of respect. On his return east, he was appointed first photographer for the newly established United States Geological Survey, and later, on the recommendations of Brady, King, and Gardner, he was appointed chief photographer for the Department of the Treasury in 1880. Already ill with tuberculosis, he left this position after only a few months because of poor health.
