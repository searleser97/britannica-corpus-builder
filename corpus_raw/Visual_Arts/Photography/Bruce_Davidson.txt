Bruce Davidson,  (born September 5, 1933, Oak Park, Illinois, U.S.), American photographer and filmmaker whose emotionally charged images frequently convey the loneliness and isolation of the subjects portrayed.
Davidson studied photography at the Rochester (New York) Institute of Technology (1951–54) and the School of Design of Yale University (1955) in New Haven, Connecticut. He worked for Life magazine for a year before joining the Magnum Photos cooperative in 1958. During this period he produced a number of outstanding photo-essays on such subjects as a circus clown, a Brooklyn teenage gang, Welsh mining towns, and London life. Davidson’s first important published project was East 100th Street (1970), a book of 123 photographs of the inhabitants of a single block in East Harlem in New York City. Davidson selected these photos from the more than 1,000 he took, with a large-format camera, over a two-year period. The pictures are distinguished by the sensitivity and dignity afforded to the subjects and by the close rapport that is evident between the photographer and those he portrayed. Books featuring his photographs include Subsistence U.S.A. (1973), with text by Carol Hill, Bruce Davidson Photographs (1978), Subway (1986), Central Park (1995), and In Color (2014). He has also made several short films.
