Dye-transfer process,   in photography, technique for preparing coloured photographic prints in which the colours of the subject are resolved by optical filters into three components, each of which is recorded on a separate gelatin negative. The three negatives are converted into relief positives in which the depth of the gelatin is related to the intensity of the colour component; each image is then saturated with a dye of complementary colour, and the finished print is assembled by transferring the dyes one at a time, and in register, to a suitable surface.
Up to 150 prints can be obtained from a set of gelatin-relief positives simply by redyeing them and repeating the transfer. In the late 20th century, the development of a panchromatic matrix film made it possible to produce the relief positives directly from a colour negative.
