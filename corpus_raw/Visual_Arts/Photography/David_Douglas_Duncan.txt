David Douglas Duncan,  (born January 23, 1916, Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.—died June 7, 2018, Grasse, France), American photojournalist noted for his dramatic combat photographs of the Korean War.
After graduating in 1938 from the University of Miami in Florida, Duncan worked as a freelance photographer. During World War II he served with the U.S. Marine Corps, photographing aviation activities in the Pacific. In 1946 he became a staff photographer for Life magazine. He covered the Korean War in 1950; his photographs, which later appeared in the book This Is War! (1951), conveyed the daily life of an ordinary soldier.
In 1956 Duncan resigned from Life and resumed freelance work. His meeting with Pablo Picasso in 1956 resulted in an enduring interest in the artist and his work, reflected in Duncan’s photographic essays The Private World of Pablo Picasso (1958), Picasso’s Picassos (1961), Goodbye Picasso (1974), and The Silent Studio (1976). In 1981 Duncan had a show at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York City of 250 pictures of the artist in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Picasso’s birth.
Duncan’s pictures of the Democratic and Republican presidential conventions in 1968 appeared in Self-Portrait, U.S.A. (1969), and a selection of his Vietnam War photographs made up War Without Heroes (1971). His later, experimental works were published in Prismatics: Exploring a New World (1973) and Magic Worlds of Fantasy (1978). His autobiography, Yankee Nomad: A Pictorial Odyssey, was published in 1966.
