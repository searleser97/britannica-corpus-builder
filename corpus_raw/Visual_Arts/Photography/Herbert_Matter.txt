Herbert Matter,  (born April 25, 1907, Engelberg, Switzerland—died  May 8, 1984, Southampton, New York, U.S.), Swiss-born American photographer and graphic designer known for his pioneering use of photomontage in commercial art.
Matter studied with the painters Fernand Léger and Amédée Ozenfant in Paris, where he later assisted the graphic artist Cassandre and the architect Le Corbusier. His own international reputation was firmly established during the mid-1930s, when he made travel posters for the Swiss National Tourist Office in Zürich. These posters were among the earliest effective uses of photomontage, the technique of constructing a picture from parts of more than one photograph.
In 1936 Matter moved to New York City to work as a freelance photographer for such fashion magazines as Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue, a pursuit he continued until 1946, when he became the staff photographer for Condé Nast publishers, a position he held until 1957. His work often involved manipulating negatives or cropping and retouching images in unexpected ways, and his subjects included portraits, nudes, landscapes, and still lifes. Matter also collaborated on the design work of the Swiss and Corning Glass pavilions of the New York World’s Fair of 1939 and was a design consultant for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, Texas. He was a professor of graphic arts and photography at Yale University from 1958 to 1976.
