Stefan Lorant,  (born February 22, 1901, Budapest [Hungary]—died November 14, 1997, Rochester, Minnesota), Hungarian-born American editor, author, and pioneer in photojournalism who is also well known for his pictorial histories of American presidents.
Lorant attended the Academy of Economics in Budapest and then worked as a director, cameraman, and editor of films in Vienna and Berlin. From 1926 to 1933 he was editor in chief of the renowned Münchner Illustrierte Presse, where he did much to influence and develop the new field of photojournalism, which at that time had its most active practitioners and patrons in Germany. After a brief imprisonment in a Nazi concentration camp, Lorant went in 1934 to England, where he helped create three of the country’s most popular illustrated periodicals—Weekly Illustrated (founder and editor, 1934), Lilliput (editor in chief, 1937–40), and Picture Post (1938–40). In addition to promoting the careers of such influential photographers as Felix Man, Alfred Eisenstaedt, and Robert Capa, he formulated many of the most basic precepts of the then-emerging profession of photojournalism. He believed that photojournalists should not arrange a picture but should instead record events exactly as they occur. An innovative magazine editor, he instituted picture layouts with photos contrasting in size and mood, set on facing pages, a practice that is now standard. He felt that images should be organized so that they tell a story and not appear just as a collection of snapshots.
In 1939 Lorant went to the United States to do research for an issue of Picture Post dedicated to American history. This research so interested him that in 1940 he settled in the United States (he became a naturalized citizen in 1943) and quickly began to publish illustrated books on American history. Lorant is perhaps best known for his pictorial histories on the presidency. His Lincoln: His Life in Photographs (1941; rev. ed. 1957) helped to inaugurate the genre of the pictorial biography. His other works include The New World (1946; rev. ed. 1965), F.D.R. (1950), The Presidency (1951), and Lincoln: A Picture Story of His Life (1952; rev. ed. 1969). He is also well known for his monumental (over 700 pages) photographic history book, Pittsburgh, the Story of an American City (1964). He wrote two autobiographical works, I Was Hitler’s Prisoner (1935) and My Years in England (1982). In 1993 the International Center of Photography presented Lorant with a Lifetime Achievement Award.
