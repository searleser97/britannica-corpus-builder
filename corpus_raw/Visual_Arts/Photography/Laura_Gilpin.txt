Laura Gilpin,  (born April 22, 1891, Colorado Springs, Colo., U.S.—died  Nov. 30, 1979, Santa Fe, N.M.), American photographer noted for her images of the landscape and native peoples of the American Southwest.
On the advice of photographer Gertrude Käsebier, Gilpin went to New York City in 1916 to study at the Clarence H. White School of Photography (1916–18). In her early work Gilpin practiced the Pictorialist style, which imitates the effects of painting. Returning to Colorado in 1922, she turned to commercial work, mainly architectural photography and portraiture. She also published guidebooks, providing both images and text. From 1942 to 1945 she worked as the chief photographer for Boeing Airlines in Wichita, Kan., and from 1946 to 1968 she photographed the Navajo people, documenting their way of life in her eloquent platinum (and sometimes silver) prints. This project culminated in the publication of The Enduring Navaho (1968). Gilpin next traveled to New Mexico, where she photographed Pueblo Indians and the Canyon de Chelly region, near Santa Fe. Among her books of photographs are The Pueblos (1941), Temples in Yucatan (1948), and The Rio Grande (1949).
