Robert Frank,  (born November 9, 1924, Zürich, Switzerland—died September 9, 2019, Inverness, Nova Scotia, Canada), Swiss American photographer and director who was one of the most influential photographers of the mid-20th century, noted for his ironic renderings of American life.
Frank became a professional industrial photographer at the age of 22 and in the 1940s became a successful fashion photographer for Harper’s Bazaar magazine in Paris. He felt, however, that the scope of the work was too limited. He abandoned fashion photography about 1948 and went to the United States and then to Peru to explore the expressive possibilities of the 35-mm camera.
After photographing in Europe in 1950 and 1953, Frank returned to the United States. Between 1955 and 1956 he drove across the country, taking a number of photographs. Of those, 83 were ultimately published as The Americans (1959), a photographic book with an introduction by the American novelist Jack Kerouac; a French-language version, Les Américains, had first appeared in 1958. Photographs such as Chicago, 1956 in The Americans revealed Frank’s mature style, which was characterized by bold composition and ironic, sometimes bitter, social commentary. Their publication established Frank as a major creative photographer, and the book was widely hailed as a classic.
After 1959 Frank turned primarily to filmmaking. His first directorial effort, the short film Pull My Daisy (1959), was based on a play by Kerouac and featured the poets Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and Peter Orlovsky, as well as the painter Larry Rivers. Pull My Daisy was a critical success, but Frank’s later films, a number of which were also shorts, were not so well received. Perhaps most notable of his subsequent works was the documentary Cocksucker Blues (1972), about the Rolling Stones’ 1972 American tour.
While continuing to make films, Frank returned to photography in the 1970s. In the ensuing decades, he published a number of books, and in 1994 the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., staged a definitive retrospective of his career. His life was chronicled in the documentaries Leaving Home, Coming Home: A Portrait of Robert Frank (2004) and Don’t Blink—Robert Frank (2015).
