Sir Thomas Hopkinson, in full Henry Thomas Hopkinson,  (born April 19, 1905, Manchester, Eng.—died  June 20, 1990, Oxford, Oxfordshire), British editor and a leader in the development of photojournalism.
Hopkinson was a freelance journalist until he joined (1934) Hungarian-born editor Stefan Lorant at the Weekly Illustrated. In 1938 the two founded Picture Post, the first British magazine to emphasize pictures over words and to record the lives of ordinary people rather than the aristocracy. As chief editor after 1940 Hopkinson guided Picture Post and its witty associated publication Lilliput through 10 years of great popularity and influence. He was fired by the publisher in a dispute over controversial editorial content.
After working as features editor of the News Chronicle (1954–56) Hopkinson moved to Johannesburg, South Africa, to edit Drum (1958–61), which was aimed at the urban black community. He resigned amid growing racial tensions, but he continued to promote the training of black African journalists in his role as regional director (1963–66) of the International Press Institute in Nairobi, Kenya. After his return to England (1967) he taught journalism and wrote his memoirs. He was knighted in 1978.
