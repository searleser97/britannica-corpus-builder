Nestor Almendros,  (born Oct. 30, 1930, Barcelona, Spain—died  March 4, 1992, New York, N.Y., U.S.), cinematographer and recipient of an Oscar from the U.S. Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences for the best cinematography for his work on Days of Heaven (1978).
Emigrating from Spain to Cuba in 1948, Almendros worked there for several years and made amateur films with Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and other young Cuban enthusiasts. He spent a year in Rome at the Centro Sperimentale and then taught for a while in the United States. While there, he became friendly with underground filmmakers Maya Deren and Adolfas and Jonas Mekas. Almendros returned to Cuba after the revolution in 1959 and worked on several documentaries of the early Castro era but found the film industry there too bureaucratic.
Almendros moved to France in 1961, where he did film shorts and television work. His first feature film and his first film in 35-millimetre format was Eric Rohmer’s La Collectionneuse (1966). He also filmed Ma nuit chez Maud (1968; My Night at Maud’s), Le Genou de Claire (1970; Claire’s Knee), and L’Amour, l’après-midi (1972; Chloe in the Afternoon) for Rohmer. With François Truffaut he did L’Enfant sauvage (1970; The Wild Child), Domicile conjugal (1970; Bed and Board ), and Les Deux Anglaises et le continent (1971; Two English Girls). His later films included the popular L’Amour en fuite (1979; Love on the Run). Almendros’ autobiography, A Man with a Camera, was published in 1984.
