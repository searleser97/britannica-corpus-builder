Lotte Jacobi, in full Lotte Johanna Alexandra Jacobi,  (born August 17, 1896, Thorn, Germany—died May 6, 1990, Concord, New Hampshire, U.S.), German-American photographer noted for her portraits of famous figures.
Born into a family of photographers (her great-grandfather began as a professional daguerreotypist in 1840), Jacobi studied art history and literature at the Academy of Posen (1912–16) and attended the Bavarian State Academy of Photography in Munich and the University of Munich (1925–27). She directed the family’s photography business in Berlin (1927–35), photographing prominent individuals such as Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, but then fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and settled in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1940. She maintained a studio in New York City from 1935 to 1955 and then settled and worked in rural Deering, New Hampshire.
Jacobi’s portraits are noted for their natural, unpretentious, and often casual style. Her sitters included Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann, Peter Lorre, Marc Chagall, Alfred Stieglitz, Eleanor Roosevelt, J.D. Salinger, Marianne Moore, Robert Frost, and many others. In her later years she created what she called “photogenics,” which were abstract prints created by moving flashlights and candles over light-sensitive paper.
