Frederick H. Evans, in full Frederick Henry Evans,  (born June 26, 1853, London, England—died June 24, 1943, London), English photographer whose studies of cathedrals in England and France are considered among the world’s finest architectural photographs.
Little is known of Evans’s early life. He first attracted attention as a London bookseller who accompanied his transactions with informative and stimulating conversation and who championed the work of two of his steady customers, the dramatist George Bernard Shaw and the artist Aubrey Beardsley.
After purchasing a quarter-plate camera, suitable for landscape work, and educating himself in art history, Evans retired from bookselling in 1898 to devote all of his time to photographing the cathedrals of England and France. A fastidious craftsman, he often spent weeks studying the light in a cathedral at various times of day, waiting to catch the precise effect he sought. In Evans’s view, light represented spiritual enlightenment. His style, which emphasized a cathedral’s immense spaces and infinite variety of light and textures, culminated in works such as A Sea of Steps, Wells Cathedral (1903).
A man of strong opinions on many subjects, Evans was constantly involved in controversy. His most impassioned beliefs involved what he considered to be the proper practice of photography. A purist, he believed in never altering a photographic image after exposing the film. His goal was to create an aesthetically and spiritually satisfying image, utilizing the play of light and shadow on static architectural structures. He did not try to capture spontaneous moments. His advice was largely ignored by younger photographers, and he spent the last years of his life virtually forgotten, privately publishing limited editions of platinotype editions of his collection of drawings by artists such as Beardsley.
