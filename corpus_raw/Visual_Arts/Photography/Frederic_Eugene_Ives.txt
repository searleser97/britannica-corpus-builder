Frederic Eugene Ives,  (born Feb. 17, 1856, Litchfield, Conn., U.S.—died  May 27, 1937, Philadelphia), American photographer and inventor.
As a boy, Ives was apprenticed to a printer at the Litchfield Enquirer, where he became interested in photography. By the time he was 18 years old, he was in charge of the Cornell University photographic laboratory. While there, he developed an early halftone process using a gelatin relief. He continued to improve this process, and in 1881 he worked on the first commercial production of halftone printing plates using his method; in 1885 he introduced an improved halftone screen.
Among Ives’s 70 patents were those for halftone photogravure (anticipating rotogravure); the modern short-tube, single-objective binocular microscope; and the photochromoscope (also called kromskop) camera and the chromogram (also spelled kromogram). The latter, a viewing instrument that accurately combined and projected the three-separation colour negative produced by the former, was of particular importance in the development of full-colour projection. Some of his early prints are preserved in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.
