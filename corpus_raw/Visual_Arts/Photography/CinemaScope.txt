CinemaScope,  filmmaking process in which a motion picture is projected on a screen, with the width of the image two and a half times its height. The French physicist Henri Chrétien (1879–1956) invented the technique in the late 1920s by which a camera, with the addition of a special lens, can “squeeze” a wide picture onto standard 35-millimetre film. Then, by the use of a special projection lens, the image is restored to clarity and expanded onto a wide screen without distorting the proportions. The invention was ignored until the increasing incursion of television into the film-viewing market in the 1940s and ’50s forced the industry to find new means of attracting audiences.
Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation acquired the rights to CinemaScope and introduced it in its 1953 adaptation of the American author Lloyd C. Douglas’s best seller The Robe. It used a four-track stereophonic sound system along with the wider screen. Other studios subsequently used the same basic technique under names such as SuperScope, WarnerScope, and Panavision. By the late 1950s most films released by the major film studios were filmed for projection on a wide screen, and most theatres were equipped to show these films.
