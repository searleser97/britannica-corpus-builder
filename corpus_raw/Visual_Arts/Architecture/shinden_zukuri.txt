Shinden-zukuri,   Japanese architectural style for mansion-estates constructed in the Heian period (794–1185) and consisting of a shinden, or chief central building, to which subsidiary structures were connected by corridors.
The shinden style developed when the Heian court nobility, given rectangular plots of land around the imperial enclosure, based the construction of their houses on the same Chinese models as had been used in designing the Imperial Palace. The complex centred on the shinden, which faced south on an open court. The eastern and western tainoya, or subsidiary living quarters, were attached by watadono, wide covered corridors, from which narrow corridors extended south, ending in tsuridono, small pavilions, creating a U-shaped arrangement around the court. Wealthier nobles built additional buildings behind the shinden and tainoya.
The moya, or main room of the shinden, was surrounded by a secondary roofed veranda, or hisashi. The moya was not partitioned, privacy being secured by low portable screens. Mats on the floor served for seating. Across the court from the moya was the pond garden, forming the enclosure’s southern limit. Mountain shapes, trees, and rocks combined in a landscape representation of the Western Paradise of the Amida Buddha. The eastern gate was the formal entrance around which officers and guards were quartered.
In smaller complexes, as time progressed, corridors gradually were shortened until they disappeared, and the outbuildings came to be attached to the central building. Sliding partitions, rather than physical distance, were used more and more to differentiate living quarters.
