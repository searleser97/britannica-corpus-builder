Heraeum,   in ancient Greece, a temple or sanctuary dedicated to Hera, queen of the Olympian gods. The most important of these was the Argive Heraeum, five miles (eight kilometres) northeast of Argos, Greece, where Heraâ€™s cult was established at an early date (c. 750 bc). A number of successive temples occupied that site, the last and best known of which was a limestone structure in the Doric order designed by the architect Eupolemos (423 bc). It housed a famous gold and ivory statue of the goddess by Polyclitus the Elder. Other major heraea were at Olympia and Samos in Greece, and at Lacinium, near Crotone, in southern Italy. Only ruins of any of these sanctuaries survive.
