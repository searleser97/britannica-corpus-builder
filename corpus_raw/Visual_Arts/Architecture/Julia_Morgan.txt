Julia Morgan,  (born January 20, 1872, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died February 2, 1957, San Francisco), one of the most prolific and important woman architects ever to work in the United States.
Morgan was born into a prosperous family (see Researcher’s Note: Julia Morgan’s date of birth). She graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a degree in engineering in 1894 and then studied architecture privately under the local architect Bernard Maybeck, who encouraged her aspirations. Morgan went to Paris in 1896 and in 1898 became the first woman to be enrolled in the architecture section of the École des Beaux-Arts, from which she graduated in 1902. Returning to California, she became the first woman in the state to be granted an architect’s license.
Morgan then commenced 40 years of architectural work that resulted in some 800 buildings, most of them in California, particularly in San Francisco. She opened her own architectural office in 1904, and the devastation of the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 provided her with the opportunity to design hundreds of homes and many churches, office buildings, and educational buildings in the Bay area. After World War I she began work in earnest for the publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, who in 1919 commissioned her to build a country house that came to be known as Hearst Castle at his family ranch at San Simeon, California. Hearst commissioned several other residences from her as well. Morgan was involved with the building project at San Simeon for 28 years. She made it into one of the most lavish and ostentatious private residences in the world, and one that successfully incorporated much of Hearst’s collection of antiques, works of art, and architectural elements.
Morgan was an eclectic architect who worked in a variety of styles. She was notable for her meticulous craftsmanship, her creation of fine interior spaces, and her ability to deliver outstanding buildings within a tight budget.
