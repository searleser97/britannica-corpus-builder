Gregory King,  (born Dec. 15, 1648, Lichfield, Staffordshire, Eng.—died  Aug. 29, 1712, London), English genealogist, engraver, and statistician, best known for his Natural and Political Observations and Conclusions upon the State and Condition of England, 1696, first published in 1801, which gives the best available picture of England’s population and wealth at the end of the 17th century. A man of remarkable versatility, he edited the Book of Roads, for which he supervised the engravings (executing several himself), assisted in the drawing of the map of London, and constructed the map of Westminster.
King was responsible for the layout of the streets and squares in Soho, London, and for drawing up many of the first building leases in various parts of London. He was also a specialist in heraldry and was employed at coronations and other ceremonials at home and abroad. His incomplete autobiography was published posthumously in J. Dallaway’s Inquiries into the Origin and Progress of the Science of Heraldry in England (1793).
