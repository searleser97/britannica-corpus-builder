Eliel Saarinen, in full Eliel Gottlieb Saarinen,  (born August 20, 1873, Rantasalmi, Finland—died  July 1, 1950, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, U.S.), one of the foremost architects and urban planners of his generation in Finland before moving to the United States, where he influenced modern architecture, particularly skyscraper and church design. He frequently collaborated with his son, Eero Saarinen, who was also an outstanding American architect.
Saarinen studied architecture and painting at the Polytechnic Institute and University of Helsinki. Before graduating in 1897, he developed a partnership with two classmates, and their collaborative designs showed an interest in Scandinavian vernacular building. By 1914 Saarinen was widely known in Europe for his Helsinki railroad station (1904–14) and urban planning projects for Reval (now Tallinn), Estonia, and Canberra, Australia. In 1922 he won second prize in a competition to build an office tower for the headquarters of the Chicago Tribune. His plan for the Tribune Tower, with its stepped facade, was a bold approach to massing and had a profound influence on U.S. skyscraper design.
In 1923 Saarinen and his family—which also included his second wife, Loja, a textile designer and sculptor; and daughter, Eva-Lisa—moved to the United States, where they eventually settled in Michigan. He taught at the University of Michigan and at Cranbrook Academy of Art, in Bloomfield Hills, near Detroit. From 1932 to 1948 Saarinen was president of Cranbrook Academy of Art and thereafter, until his death, head of the graduate department of architecture and city planning. He designed a group of buildings in Bloomfield Hills, including Cranbrook School for Boys (1925–30), Kingswood School for Girls (1929–30), the Institute for Science (1931–33), and the Academy of Art (1926–41).
During Saarinen’s tenure as president of Cranbrook Academy of Art, he oversaw a teaching staff that included his son, Eero; Carl Milles; Charles Eames; and Harry Bertoia. Eero joined his father’s practice in 1938, and they collaborated on such projects as the Crow Island School (1940) in Winnetka, Illinois, which influenced postwar school design, and the First Christian Church (1942) in Columbus, Indiana. Another church, Christ Lutheran, in Minneapolis, Minnesota (1949–50), was the elder Saarinen’s last completed building and considered by some his finest. His designs for the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, were retouched by Eero, and the building was completed in 1956.
Eliel Saarinen was awarded the American Institute of Architects (AIA) gold medal in 1947. His writings included The City, Its Growth, Its Decay, Its Future (1943) and Search for Form (1948).
