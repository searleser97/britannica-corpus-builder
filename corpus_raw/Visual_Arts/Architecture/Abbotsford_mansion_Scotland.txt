Abbotsford,  former home of the 19th-century novelist Sir Walter Scott, situated on the right bank of the River Tweed, Scottish Borders council area, historic county of Roxburghshire, Scotland. Scott purchased the original farm, then known as Carley Hole, in 1811 and transformed it (1817–25) into a Gothic-style baronial mansion now known as Abbotsford House. Still the home of Scott’s direct descendants, Abbotsford House remains virtually unchanged. It contains Scott’s valuable library, family portraits, and an interesting collection of historical relics, and it is open to the public during the summer. The surrounding area was a major source of inspiration for Scott’s historical novels.
