Sven Markelius, in full Sven Gottfrid Markelius,  (born Oct. 25, 1889, Stockholm, Sweden—died Feb. 27, 1972, Stockholm), eminent Swedish architect who introduced the International Style into Sweden in the 1920s.
Markelius studied at the Institute of Technology and the Academy of Fine Arts in Stockholm and opened his own architectural office in Stockholm in 1915. From the early years of his practice, Markelius won numerous important design competitions throughout Sweden. His prize-winning design for a concert-hall complex at Helsingborg (1925) is perhaps his major work; its spare, rectilinear forms, with their white walls and broad glazing, reflect the bold anonymity that was coming to characterize academic European design. Among his more experimental works is the Collective House (1935) in Stockholm, which provided communal kitchens, restaurants, nurseries, and other domestic facilities to accommodate families in which both parents worked outside the home.
Markelius achieved international recognition with his design for the Swedish Pavilion at the New York World’s Fair in 1939. His own home in Kevinge, a low-roofed, sprawling villa among rocks and trees, became a prototype for informal, “site-conscious” houses throughout the world. As director of planning for the city of Stockholm (1938–54), he supervised the design of Vallingby, a satellite community established in 1953.
