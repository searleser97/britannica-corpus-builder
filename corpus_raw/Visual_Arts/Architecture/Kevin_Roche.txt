Kevin Roche, in full Eamonn Kevin Roche,  (born June 14, 1922, Dublin, Ireland—died March 1, 2019, Guilford, Connecticut, U.S.), Irish American architect of governmental, educational, and corporate structures, especially noted for the work he did in partnership with Eero Saarinen.
Roche graduated in 1945 with a bachelor’s degree in architecture from the National University of Ireland, Dublin. After short-term employment with firms in Dublin and London, he did postgraduate work at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago under Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. He worked briefly with the United Nations Planning Office in New York City and in 1950 joined the firm of Eero Saarinen and Associates, functioning from 1954 to 1961 as the firm’s principal associate in design.
After Saarinen’s death in 1961, Roche and his future partner, John Dinkeloo (1918–81), completed Saarinen’s incomplete projects, including the Dulles International Airport terminal building near Washington, D.C. (1962), the Vivian Beaumont Repertory Theater for the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in Manhattan (opened 1965), and the stainless steel Gateway Arch of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial in St. Louis, Missouri (1965).
In 1966 they launched Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates. Their design approach retained some similarity to that of Saarinen in its individual examination of and response to each new project. Among the projects for which Roche and Dinkeloo are known are the headquarters of the Ford Foundation in New York City (1968), of General Foods Corporation in Rye, New York (1977), of Bouygues outside Paris (1983), and of Merck & Co. in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey (1993). The firm also worked for a number of American universities, designing, for example, the Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge (2002); the Helen and Martin Kimmel Center for University Life at New York University in New York City (2003); and numerous buildings on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.
Roche was the recipient of numerous honours, including the 1982 Pritzker Architecture Prize. From 1994 to 1997 he served as president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.
