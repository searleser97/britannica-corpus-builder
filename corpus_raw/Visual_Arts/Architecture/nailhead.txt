Nailhead,  projecting ornamental molding resembling the head of a nail, used in early Gothic architecture. Nailheads were used to fasten nailwork to a door, which was often studded with them decoratively, as well. They show great variety in design and are sometimes very elaborate.
On the few original doors of Norman style that still exist, the nailheads fix the hinges and iron scrollwork on the front; although the nails are usually not large on such doors, the heads sometimes project conspicuously. In the 16th and 17th centuries the hammer-shaped knockers of doors usually struck upon a large-headed nail. Locks also, especially on the outsides of doors, are frequently decorated with ornamental patterns of tracery and studs, formed by the heads of the nails and sometimes with small moldings.
