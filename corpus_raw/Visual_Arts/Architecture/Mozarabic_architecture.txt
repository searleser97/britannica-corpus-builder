Mozarabic architecture,  building style of Christians who stayed in the Iberian Peninsula after the Arab invasion of 711 ce. The style shows the assimilation of such Islamic decorative motifs and forms as the horseshoe-shaped arch and the ribbed dome. Even those who emigrated to non-Islamic areas continued to produce Mozarabic-style art and architecture, thereby helping spread Arabic influences north into Europe. Many churches built in the Mozarabic style by monks who emigrated to northern Spain (9th–11th century) survive. San Miguel de Escalada, near León, the largest surviving example of Mozarabic architecture, was founded by monks from Córdoba and consecrated in 913.
