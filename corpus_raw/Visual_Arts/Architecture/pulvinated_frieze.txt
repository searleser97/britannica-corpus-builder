Pulvinated frieze,   in Classical architecture, frieze that is characteristically convex, appearing swollen or stuffed in profile. This type of frieze, or entablature midsection, located below the cornice and above the architrave, is most often found in the Ionic order of Classical decoration. Its surface treatment may be absolutely plain or ornately carved or painted. There are examples of the pulvinated frieze in late Roman designs, as in the Pantheon in Rome; and it is frequently featured in the works of Italian Renaissance architects. The pulvinated frieze, the name of which is derived from the Latin word pulvinus (“pillow”), is also sometimes called the pillowed, or cushioned, frieze.
