Ornamentation,  in architecture, applied embellishment in various styles that is a distinguishing characteristic of buildings, furniture, and household items. Ornamentation often occurs on entablatures, columns, and the tops of buildings and around entryways and windows, especially in the form of moldings. Throughout antiquity and into the Renaissance, and later for religious buildings, applied ornament was very important, often having symbolic meaning. The anthemion petal motif was especially popular on the moldings of ancient Greek cornices. Other motifs from antiquity include the Egyptian cartouche (oval), fretwork (banding) of capitals, fluting and reeding of columns, bas-relief egg-and-dart moldings (with alternating oval and pointed forms), and scrollwork such as that found on Ionic capitals and in the running-dog pattern (or wave scroll). Brattishing refers to the continuous embellishment around the top of a wall, common in the Gothic period. The diaper motif, an allover pattern of small repeated shapes, was also often used in this period. The use of strapwork (interlaced scrollwork), which originated with Islamic metalwork, is characteristic of Mannerist architecture and furniture.
