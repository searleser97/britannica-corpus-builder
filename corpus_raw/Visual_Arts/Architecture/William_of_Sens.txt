William Of Sens, French Guillaume De Sens,  (died Aug. 11, 1180, France), French master-mason who built the first structure in the Early Gothic style in England.
William is one of the first cathedral architects to be known by name. Exact knowledge of his contribution was preserved in the report of an eyewitness, the monk Gervase, who described the destruction by fire (1174) of Canterbury Cathedral’s choir and its subsequent rebuilding by William. He was already famous at that time as a leading builder and “most subtle artisan” of Sens, Fr. Called to Canterbury in 1175, he was given the task of using the remaining foundation of the choir and extending it toward the east.
William probably planned the whole choir, as well as other structural alterations, including the flying buttresses copied from Notre-Dame, which may still be seen on the north side. It is the interior design that is most significant, however. Here William introduced sexpartite vaulting, the form of the high arcades, and columns of stone in contrasting colours. His innovations at Canterbury are considered an early step toward the High Gothic practice of “dissolving” the walls between supporting verticals.
As work began on the vault of the eastern part of the choir, William was incapacitated by a fall from a scaffold. He probably continued to direct the work from his sickbed, but this was impractical, and so he gave up and returned to France, where he died. His successor, William the Englishman, seems to have followed his plans.
Because of similarity in design, especially in the construction of the choir, William is thought to have participated in building the Cathedral at Sens (begun 1130), one of the first churches in which Gothic architecture appears as a coherent style.
