Chatsworth,  estate near Rowsley, Derbyshire Dales district, administrative and historic county of Derbyshire, England, containing the principal seat of the English dukes of Devonshire. Chatsworth House itself stands near the left bank of the River Derwent. Construction of the original building began in 1553, but, after suffering occupation by both parties to the English Civil Wars of the mid-17th century, this house was subsequently demolished. The present mansion, often called “Palace of the Peak,” was designed by William Talman for William Cavendish, the 4th earl (created 1st duke of Devonshire, 1694), and was begun in 1687. The 6th duke made various additions, including the long north wing (1820–27). The house has a library and an art collection with many masterpieces in it. The formal gardens that surround the house were designed by Sir Joseph Paxton, and the estate’s park is more than 11 miles (18 km) in circumference.
