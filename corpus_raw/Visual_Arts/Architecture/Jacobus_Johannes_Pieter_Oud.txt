Jacobus Johannes Pieter Oud,  (born Feb. 9, 1890, Purmerend, near Amsterdam—died  April 5, 1963, Wassenaar, near The Hague), Dutch architect notable for his pioneering role in the development of modern architecture.
Oud was educated in Amsterdam and at the Delft Technical University, after which he worked with a number of architects in Leiden and Munich. In 1916 he met Theo van Doesburg, and together the two men founded in 1917 the influential review De Stijl, which set forth the theories of the de Stijl group of avant-garde artists. Oud soon became the chief proponent of the de Stijl idiom in modern architecture. Among his earliest architectural projects in this austere, highly geometric style were theoretical projects for houses at Scheveningen (1917) and for a factory at Purmerend (1919). He designed a hotel at Noordwijkerhout (1917) and the Allegonda villa at Katwijk (1917). These and other buildings featured subtle oppositions of horizontal and vertical lines; long, straight walls wrapping into smoothly rounded corners; building units enclosing an open space; and simplified rectilinear and circular forms that achieve a subtly poised equilibrium despite their assymmetrical arrangement.
In 1918 Oud was appointed housing architect to the city of Rotterdam, in which post he was required to supply sorely needed mass housing for workers. The housing blocks he subsequently designed and built at Spangen (1918), Tusschendijken (1920), and Hoek van Holland (1924–27) had a sober and functional austerity that contrasted strongly with the picturesque elaboration of detail typical of the school of Amsterdam led by Michel de Klerk. His Café de Unie (1924–27, destroyed in 1940) and Kiefhoek estate (1925–27), both in Rotterdam, also emphasized de Stijl principles, although by then he was tending toward separation from the movement. Oud’s book Höllandische Architektur (1926) gave him an international reputation.
Among his late works are the monumental and somewhat ornate Shell Building (1938) in The Hague, which disappointed some because of Oud’s evident abandonment in it of de Stijl principles. The Bio-Children’s Convalescent Home (1952–60) near Arnhem, however, convincingly demonstrated Oud’s continuing mastery of the elegant geometrical compositions typical of what had become known as the International Style.
