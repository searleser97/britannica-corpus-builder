Peter Eisenman, in full Peter David Eisenman,  (born August 12, 1932, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.), American architect known for his radical designs and architectural theories. He is often characterized as a deconstructivist.
Eisenman studied at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York (B.A., 1955), Columbia University, New York City (M.S., 1960), and the University of Cambridge (M.A., 1962; Ph.D., 1963). In 1967 he founded the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York City, and from 1973 to 1982 he was editor of the institute’s publication, Oppositions, which was one of the foremost journals of architectural thought. He also taught at a variety of universities, including the University of Cambridge, Princeton University, Yale University, Harvard University, the Ohio State University, and Cooper Union in New York City.
During his tenure at the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, Eisenman became renowned as a theoretician of architecture. He thought outside the traditional parameters of “built work,” concerning himself instead with a conceptual form of architecture, in which the process of architecture is represented through diagrams rather than through actual construction. In his designs he fragmented existing architectural models in a way that drew upon concepts from philosophy and linguistics, specifically the ideas of the philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Jacques Derrida and the linguist Noam Chomsky. Because of these affiliations, Eisenman was alternately classified as a postmodernist, deconstructivist, and poststructuralist.
Beginning in the late 1960s, Eisenman’s ideas took form in a series of numbered houses—e.g., House I (1967–68) in Princeton, New Jersey, House II (1969–70) in Hardwick, Vermont, and House VI (1972–75) in Cornwall, Connecticut. These structures were in effect a series of experiments that referred to Modernism’s rigid geometry and rectangular plans but took these elements to a theoretical extreme: in details such as stairways that led nowhere and columns that did not function as support for the structure, Eisenman rejected the functional concept that was at the core of much Modernism. This early work, which some critics saw as nihilistic, earned him a place as one of the “New York Five,” along with future postmodernists Richard Meier and Michael Graves.
In 1980 Eisenman established a professional practice in New York City. He embarked on a number of major projects, characterized by disconcerting forms, angles, and materials, including the Wexner Center for the Arts (1983–89) at the Ohio State University in Columbus, the Greater Columbus (Ohio) Convention Center (1993), and the Aronoff Center for Design and Art (1996) at the University of Cincinnati (Ohio). In the Wexner Center, one of the best known of his commissions, Eisenman flouted traditional planning by creating a north-south grid for the spine of the building that was exactly perpendicular to the east-west axis of the university campus. He also challenged viewers’ expectation of materials, enclosing half the space in glass and the other half in scaffolding. Among his later projects were the award-winning Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe (2005) in Berlin and the University of Phoenix Stadium (2006; later the State Farm Stadium) in Glendale, Arizona. He then planned a series of buildings that included a museum, library, and performance space for the City of Culture of Galicia (begun 1999), Santiago de Compostela, Spain. He also designed the Residenze Carlo Erba, Milan (2019).
Eisenman published Diagram Diaries in 1999. His later writings included Eisenman Inside Out: Selected Writings, 1963–1988 (2004); Peter Eisenman: Barefoot on White-Hot Walls (2005), edited by Peter Noever; Written into the Void: Selected Writings 1990–2004 (2007); Ten Canonical Buildings, 1950–2000 (2008); and Lateness (2020). Eisenman was the recipient of the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement at the 2004 Venice Architecture Biennale.
