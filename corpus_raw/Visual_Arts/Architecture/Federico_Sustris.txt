Federico Sustris, also called Friedrich Sustris,  (born  c. 1540, Venice? [Italy]—died  1599, Munich [Germany]),  court painter and principal architect to Duke William V of Bavaria, and one of the major exponents of the late international Mannerist style in southern Germany.
His father, Lambert, of Flemish origin, was active mainly in Italy, at Venice and Padua, where Federico probably received his early training under his father. In 1563 he went to Florence as a student and then as assistant in the studio of the painter, architect, and historian Giorgio Vasari. A style of Mannerism practiced there was called studiolo, after the small study of Cosimo de’ Medici (Cosimo I) decorated by Vasari’s circle. It is a modification of this style—characterized by brilliant colouring, a subtle eroticism, and generally intimate scale—that Sustris later introduced in Bavaria.
Hans Fugger, member of a prominent family of merchant-bankers, called Sustris to Augsburg about 1568, where he decorated a series of rooms (1569–73), the so-called Fugger Bath Rooms (now a museum). By 1573 Sustris had entered the service of William V, duke of Bavaria, a champion of the Counter-Reformation. Sustris worked on the renovation and decoration of the residence at Trausnitz (1577–80).
In about 1580–81 Sustris went to Munich, where he built his best-known work, St. Michael’s Church. He began planning the structure in 1582 in collaboration with Wolfgang Muller. Sustris was essentially self-taught as an architect, and his contribution to the work—the design of the chancel and transepts—is less structural than decorative. Nevertheless, the impression of dynamic interior space converged in St. Michael’s, the first large Jesuit church in northern Europe, is perhaps unequalled in Germany.
