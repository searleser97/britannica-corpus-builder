Edward Durell Stone,   (born March 9, 1902, Fayetteville, Ark., U.S.—died  Aug. 6, 1978, New York City), American architect who directed the design of a number of significant modern buildings.
Stone studied art at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, in 1920–23 and architecture at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1927 he won a two-year scholarship that enabled him to study and travel in Europe, and during that period he was exposed to the modern movement in architecture there. In 1930 Stone joined the New York firm responsible for the design of Radio City Music Hall. He organized his own architectural firm in 1936. He participated in the design of the Museum of Modern Art (1937), the first building in New York City in the International Style. After World War II, in which he served as chief of planning and design for the U.S. Army Air Corps, he became an associate professor of architecture at Yale University (1946–52).
Among Stone’s best-known buildings outside the United States are El Panamá Hotel, Panama City, Panama (1946), notable for its pioneering use of cantilevered balconies in the construction of a resort hotel; the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi (1954); and the Nuclear Research Center, near Islāmābād, Pak. (1966). The embassy in New Delhi, with its lacy grilles and an inner water garden, fountains, and islands of plantings, was well received and led to many foreign commissions. His design for the American Pavilion for the Brussels World’s Fair of 1958, a circular structure 340 feet (104 m) in diameter with a free-span translucent roof, also attracted attention.
Examples of Stone’s work in the United States include the Fine Arts Center, University of Arkansas (1948); the Gallery of Modern Art, formerly housing the Huntington Hartford collection (1959; now the New York Cultural Center) in New York City; the National Geographic Society headquarters (design completion 1961) in Washington, D.C.; and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (1971), also in Washington, D.C. His skyscrapers include the 50-story General Motors Tower in New York City (design completion 1964) and the 80-story Standard Oil (Indiana) Tower in Chicago (1974; now the Aon Center).
Stone’s autobiography, The Evolution of an Architect, was published in 1962.
