Stanford White,  (born November 9, 1853, New York, New York, U.S.—died June 25, 1906, New York), American architect who was the most imaginative partner in the influential architectural firm McKim, Mead, and White.
Stanford White was the son of the essayist, critic, and Shakespearean scholar Richard Grant White. He was carefully trained as an architect by Henry Hobson Richardson. In June 1880 he joined Charles Follen McKim and William Rutherford Mead in founding a new architectural firm that soon became the most popular and prolific one in the country. Until about 1887 their organization concentrated on designing large country and seaside mansions in what was called the Shingle style. White designed one of the subtlest of these informally planned structures, the Casino (1881) at Newport, Rhode Island. Subsequently, the partners, aided by their gifted draftsman Joseph Morrill Wells, led the American trend toward Neoclassicism and away from styles then being developed in Chicago and elsewhere.
White excelled at designing gracefully proportioned structures set off by exquisite Italian Renaissance ornamentation. Among his more important commissions in New York City were Madison Square Garden (1891), the Washington Memorial Arch (1891), the New York Herald Building (1892), and Madison Square Presbyterian Church (1906). White was a versatile artist who designed jewelry, furniture, and a wide range of interior decorations. An enthusiastic and extroverted man, he was noted for his lavish entertainments. He was shot to death at Madison Square Garden by Henry Kendall (“Harry”) Thaw, the jealous husband of the showgirl Evelyn Nesbit, with whom White had had a love affair.
