Maekawa Kunio,  Maekawa also spelled Mayekawa,  (born May 14, 1905, Niigata-shi, Japan—died  June 27, 1986, Tokyo), Japanese architect noted for his designs of community centres and his work in concrete.
After graduation from Tokyo University in 1928, Maekawa studied with the architect Le Corbusier in Paris for two years. Returning to Japan, he tried in such works as Hinamoto Hall (1936) and the Dairen Town Hall (1938) to counteract the pompous style of the Japanese imperialist regime. In the 1950s he continued to work primarily in the style of Le Corbusier. Buildings such as the Educational Centre, Fukushima (1955), the Harumi flats in Tokyo (1959), and the Setagaya Community Centre in Tokyo (1959) reflect his efforts to use concrete in a manner appropriate to the material.
Beginning with the Tokyo Metropolitan Festival Hall (1961), Maekawa displayed a warmer and more expansive style. In the Saitama Cultural Centre (1966), he brought an entirely new approach to the design of community centres. He also designed the Japanese pavilions for both the Brussels World’s Fair (1958) and the New York World’s Fair (1964–65).
