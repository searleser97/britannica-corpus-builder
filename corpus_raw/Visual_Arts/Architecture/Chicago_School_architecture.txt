Chicago School,  group of architects and engineers who, in the late 19th century, developed the skyscraper. They included Daniel Burnham, William Le Baron Jenney, John Root, and the firm of Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan.
Among the buildings representative of the school in Chicago are the Montauk Building (Burnham and Root, 1882), the Auditorium Building (Adler and Sullivan, 1887–89), the Monadnock Building (Burnham and Root, 1891), and the Carson Pirie Scott & Co. store (originally the Schlesinger-Mayer department store; Sullivan, 1898–1904). Chicago, because of this informal school, has been called the “birthplace of modern architecture.”
