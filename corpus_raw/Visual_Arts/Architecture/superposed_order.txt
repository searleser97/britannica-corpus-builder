Superposed order,   in Classical architecture, an order, or style, of column placed above another order in the vertical plane, as in a multilevel arcade, colonnade, or facade. In the architecture of ancient Greece, where the orders originated, they were rarely superposed unless it was structurally required; and when Greek builders did superpose orders, as in some examples of the stoa, or covered walk, they were always of the same order as the columns below. In the Parthenon at Athens (5th century bc), the great eastern chamber, known as the Hecatompedon, has a two-tiered colonnade with superposed Doric orders on three sides.
Roman architects used superposed orders freely as decorative elements. The Colosseum, built at Rome in the 1st century ad, has four stories: on the ground level the order is Doric; on the next level it is Ionic; on the third, Corinthian; and the top story has pilasters (attached rectangular columns), also of the Corinthian order. Renaissance builders frequently used superposed orders, usually in the same ascending series as on the Colosseum, though they sometimes added a Composite order. They also developed the Colossal, or giant, order, a single column reaching upward through two or more stories, which could substitute for the superposed orders.
