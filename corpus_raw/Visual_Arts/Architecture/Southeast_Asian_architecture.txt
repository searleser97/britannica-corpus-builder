Southeast Asian architecture,  buildings of Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Most of Southeast Asia’s great temples were built by the 13th century. The Indian royal temple, which dominated Southeast Asian culture, typically stood on a terraced plinth, upon which towered shrines could multiply. Construction was ideally of stone but could be brick sculpted with stucco. Exteriors displayed carved rhythmic moldings and figures. In about 770 the Javanese Shailendra dynasty began its series of superb stonecut monuments, culminating in the huge Mahayana Buddhist Borobudur and the Hindu Lara Jonggrang (c. 900–930). About 800 the Cambodian king Jayavarman II built a brick mountain for a temple group. This plan was furthered when foundations were laid for Angkor, a scheme based on a grid of reservoirs and canals. Successive kings built more temple mountains there, culminating in Angkor Wat. Among Southeast Asia’s most impressive sites is the city of Pagan in Myanmar, with many brick and stucco Buddhist temples and stupas built 1056–1287. Burmese stupas (e.g., Shwe Dagon Pagoda) typically have a spreading, bell-shaped base topped by a dome and pointed spire. The many monasteries of Myanmar and Thailand, like those of Laos and Vietnam, have been repeatedly enlarged and rebuilt. The architecture of the modified Hinduism of Bali is vigorously fantastical, with gilt paint and coloured glass.
