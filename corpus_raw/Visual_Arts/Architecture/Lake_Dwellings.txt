Lake Dwellings,  German Pfahlbauten: “pile structures,” remains of prehistoric settlements within what are today the margins of lakes in southern Germany, Switzerland, France, and Italy. According to the theory advanced by the Swiss archaeologist Ferdinand Keller in the mid-19th century, the dwellings were built on platforms supported by piles above the surface of the water, and all appear very similar in construction. First, the wooden piles, the ends burned to a point, were driven deep into the mud and surrounded with heavy stones. A lacework of tree trunks and smaller branches was built across the piles, forming a platform; on the platform were built one- or two-roomed rectangular huts with beaten clay floors. Although the clay floors were used especially as a precaution against fire, the vast majority of pile dwellings appear to have ended in conflagration—either accidental or the result of enemy attack. Cattle and sheep were also raised on the platforms.
Because the Lake Dwellers usually rebuilt the new village on top of the remains of the old one, archaeologists were able to work out a culture sequence for central Europe and in the process confirmed what the Danish archaeologist Christian Thomsen had postulated for Scandinavia—that the Stone Age was immediately followed by the Bronze Age. Pile dwellings continued to be built during the Bronze Age and the Iron Age.
Anthropologists now believe that the pile dwellings may have been built above swampy land on the lake shore rather than above the waters of the lakes themselves. Similar houses and storage buildings on platforms supported by wooden piles or stone foundations are in use today in humid subtropical and tropical areas (e.g., Malaysia).
