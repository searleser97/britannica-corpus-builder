Lúcio Costa,  (born Feb. 27, 1902, Toulon, France—died June 13, 1998, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), French-born Brazilian architect best known as the creator of the master plan for Brazil’s new capital at Brasília.
After graduating from the National School of Fine Arts, Rio de Janeiro, in 1924, Costa entered into a partnership with Gregori Warchavchick, a Russian-born architect and early advocate of modern architecture in Brazil. In 1931 Costa was appointed director of the National School of Fine Arts, which included the School of Architecture. His efforts to reform the National School’s outdated curriculum inspired a generation of students who subsequently became the vanguard of modernist architecture in Brazil.
The Ministry of Education and Health building, Rio de Janeiro (1937–43), for which Costa received the commission, was designed by a team that included him and Oscar Niemeyer and had the Swiss-born French architect Le Corbusier as a consultant. This structure, notable for its system of movable sun-shade louvers, was a milestone in the introduction of modern architecture into Brazil and is considered one of the finest modern structures in Latin America. Costa and Niemeyer designed the Brazilian pavilion for the New York World’s Fair of 1939. Costa also admired Brazil’s colonial architecture, and he was active in the National Institute for Historical and Artistic Patrimony in Rio de Janeiro, which carried out the restoration of historic buildings across the country.
Costa’s plan for the city of Brasília was selected in a competition held in 1956. The plan took the form of a straight line of administrative and public buildings intersected by a curved strip of residential blocks and houses. Costa’s plan provides a monumental framework for the many public buildings erected by Niemeyer in Brasília.
