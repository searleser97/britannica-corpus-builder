Nicholas Hawksmoor,  (born c. 1661, probably at East Drayton, Nottinghamshire, Eng.—died  March 25, 1736, London), English architect whose association with Sir Christopher Wren and Sir John Vanbrugh long diverted critical attention from the remarkable originality of his own Baroque designs for churches and other institutional buildings.
Hawksmoor began to work for Wren about 1679 and owed his professional advancement in part to the political influence of the elder architect. He aided Wren in building St. Paul’s Cathedral (completed 1710) in London and Vanbrugh in constructing Castle Howard (1699–1726) in Yorkshire and Blenheim Palace (1705–25) in Oxfordshire. On Wren’s death (1723), Hawksmoor became surveyor general (chief architect) of Westminster Abbey, the west towers of which were built (1734–45) to his design. Earlier (from 1692) he was responsible for various university buildings at Oxford.
In October 1711 Hawksmoor was appointed one of two surveyors (architects) to a commission to build 50 new churches in the Cities of London and Westminster and their immediate environs. In this capacity he designed, among other churches, the four on which his reputation as a Baroque genius mainly rests: St. Anne (1714–24; consecrated in 1730) in Limehouse, St. George-in-the-East (1714–29) in Wapping Stepney, Christ Church (1714–29) in Spitalfields, and St. Mary Woolnoth (1716–24) in the City of London.
Hawksmoor knew medieval and Classical architectural principles, and he worked from them in imaginative and idiosyncratic ways. Within massive geometric solids, he created surprising details indoors, with changes from room to room, for example, and outdoors, as with unusually grouped and shaped windows or the manipulation of shadow patterns. Although in some works he made reference in details to the newly fashionable Palladianism, his importance lies in his representation of the English Baroque style.
