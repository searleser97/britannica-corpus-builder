Gūr-e Amīr, also spelled Gur-Emir, English Tomb of the Commander,  mausoleum of the 14th-century Mongol conqueror Timur, or Tamerlane, in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Though it has suffered from time and earthquakes, the monument is still sumptuous. Completed in 1404, it was originally intended to be the tomb of Timur’s grandson Muhammad Shah, but after Timur’s death in 1405 he was interred there as well, along with other members of his family. The extant structures in the complex consist of a chapel crowned with a ribbed blue-tiled dome, enclosed by a wall, and fronted by an archway. The interior walls are covered with elegant turquoise arabesques and inscriptions in gold. The Gūr-e Amīr is one of the properties included in the 2001 designation of Samarkand as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
