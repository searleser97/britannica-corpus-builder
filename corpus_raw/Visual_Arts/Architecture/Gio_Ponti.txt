Gio Ponti, byname of Giovanni Ponti,  (born Nov. 18, 1891, Milan, Italy—died  Sept. 15, 1979, Milan), Italian architect and designer associated with the development of modern architecture and modern industrial design in Italy.
Ponti graduated in 1921 from the Milan Polytechnic. From 1923 to 1938 he did industrial design for the Richard-Ginori pottery factory. In 1928 he founded the magazine Domus, which influenced interior decoration, serving as its editor until 1946.
In 1933 Ponti was appointed to the executive committee of the Fifth Milan Triennale, an international exhibition stressing the work of young Milanese avant-garde architects. Among his important buildings of the 1930s were the Institute of Mathematics, University of Rome (1934); the Catholic Press Exhibition, Vatican City (1936); and the first office block of the Montecatini company, Milan (1936). Thereafter he carried out a series of projects in various parts of the world. His best-known architectural work, the Pirelli Building, Milan (1955–59, with Pier Luigi Nervi and others), is notable for its hexagonal plan. The Denver Art Museum (1971), designed by Ponti with James Sudler, uses slits (rather than traditional windows) to play with light and shadow. Other important works include a cathedral (1971) in Taranto, Italy, and the Bijenkorf shopping centre (1967) in Eindhoven, Neth.
Simultaneously with his architecture, Ponti was active in painting, the graphic arts, design for motion pictures and the theatre—including costumes and scenery for Milan’s La Scala opera—and interior design.
