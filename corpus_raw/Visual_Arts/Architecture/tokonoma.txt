Tokonoma,  alcove in a Japanese room, used for the display of paintings, pottery, flower arrangements, and other forms of art. Household accessories are removed when not in use so that the tokonoma found in almost every Japanese house, is the focal point of the interior.
A feature of the shoin architectural style, which originated in the Kamakura period (1192–1333), the tokonoma developed from the private altar (butsudan) in Zen Buddhist priests’ homes. The butsudan  consisted of an alcove containing a narrow wooden table with an incense burner, votive candles, and flower vessels placed before a Buddhist scroll hung on the wall. In its adaptation to the Japanese house, it was used exclusively for the display of art objects.
