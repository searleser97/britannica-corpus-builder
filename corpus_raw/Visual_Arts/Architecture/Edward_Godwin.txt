Edward Godwin, in full Edward William Godwin,  (born May 26, 1833, Bristol, Gloucestershire, England—died October 6, 1886, London), British architect, designer, and writer notable for his contributions to the English Aesthetic movement in design, which drew its inspiration mainly from East Asia, particularly from Japan.
In 1854 Godwin set up his own practice, specializing in ecclesiastical architecture. In 1861 he won a competition for a design for the Northampton town hall and its decoration and furniture; the design he submitted was in the personal French Gothic Revival style that he preferred in all his early work. About that time he decorated his own house in the Japanese manner, the first of its kind in Great Britain. He moved to London in 1865 and between 1867 and 1871 designed Dromore and Glenbegh (Glenbeigh) castles in Ireland.
Godwin’s later architectural work was on a smaller domestic scale and included houses for artists at Bedford Park (with Norman Shaw; 1875–81), which was outside London, and the White House (c. 1877) in Chelsea, London, which he produced for his artist friend James McNeill Whistler. From 1865 he designed furniture, textiles, and wallpapers for commercial production and private clients.
Because of his association with the actress Ellen Terry, with whom he lived for six years, he was greatly interested in all aspects of the theatre. This theatrical interest was also shared by their two children, both of whom Terry reared: Edith Ailsa Craig (1869–1947), who was an active theatre director and costumier, as well as a suffragist, and Edward Gordon Craig, a noted stage designer.
