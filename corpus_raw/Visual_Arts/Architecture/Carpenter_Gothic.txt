Carpenter Gothic,   style of architecture that utilized Gothic forms in domestic U.S. architecture in the mid-19th century. The houses executed in this phase of the Gothic Revival style show little awareness of and almost no concern for the original structure and proportions of Gothic buildings and ornamentation. Much of this work could never have been executed if the scroll saw, also called the fret saw, had not been invented.
Carpenter Gothic is an eclectic and naive use of the most superficial and obvious motifs of Gothic decoration. Turrets, spires, and pointed arches were applied, in many instances with abandon, and there was usually no logical relationship of ornamentation to the structure of the house. At its best the work of the independent carpenter created some lively and charming homes. Carpenter Gothic houses were built throughout the United States, but surviving structures are found chiefly in the Northeast and the Midwest.
