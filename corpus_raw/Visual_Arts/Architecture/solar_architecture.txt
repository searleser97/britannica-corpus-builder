Solar, also spelled sollar,  in architecture, private room located on the floor above the great hall in a late medieval English manor house. The solar served as a kind of parlour to which the family of the owner of the manor house or castle could retire from the bustling communal living of the hall below. In fact, by the late 14th century the solar was more often called the “retiring room.” Up a flight of stairs from the dais, or platform, end of the hall, the solar usually had an adjacent chapel.
