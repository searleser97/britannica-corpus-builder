Richard Joseph Neutra,  (born April 8, 1892, Vienna, Austria—died  April 16, 1970, Wuppertal, W.Ger.), Austrian-born American architect known for his role in introducing the International Style into American architecture.
Educated at the Technical Academy, Vienna, and the University of Zürich, Neutra, with the German architect Erich Mendelsohn, won an award in 1923 for a city-planning project for Haifa, Palestine (now in Israel). Neutra moved to the United States the same year, working briefly for the firm of Holabird and Roche in Chicago and at Taliesin in Spring Green, Wis., with Frank Lloyd Wright.
Neutra’s most important early work was the Lovell House, Los Angeles (1927–29), which has glass expanses and cable-suspended balconies and is stylistically similar to the work of Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in Europe. Throughout the 1930s he designed houses in the International Style.
Shortly after World War II, Neutra created his most memorable works: the Kaufmann Desert House, Palm Springs, Calif. (1946–47), and the Tremaine House, Santa Barbara, Calif. (1947–48). Elegant and precise, these houses are considered exceptionally fine examples of the International Style. Carefully placed in the landscape, Neutra’s houses often have patios or porches that make the outdoors seem part of the house. He believed that architecture should be a means of bringing man back into harmony with nature and with himself and was particularly concerned that his houses reflect the way of life of the owner.
During the 1950s and ’60s Neutra’s works included office buildings, churches, buildings for colleges and universities, housing projects, and cultural centres. After 1966 he was in partnership with his son, the firm name becoming Richard and Dion Neutra Architects and Associates. He died while on a tour of Europe. Among his voluminous writings are Survival Through Design (1954), Life and Human Habitat (1956), and an autobiography, Life and Shape (1962).
