Sir Basil Spence,  (born August 13, 1907, Bombay—died November 19, 1976, Eye, Suffolk, England), architect best known for the new Coventry cathedral, built to replace the cathedral that had been gutted during a World War II bombing raid.
He was educated at the schools of architecture of London and Edinburgh universities and worked in Sir Edwin Lutyens’ office on drawings for the Viceroy’s House in New Delhi. Before the war he built large country houses, and in 1951 he won the competition for the new Coventry cathedral (completed in 1962). This monumental, richly decorated structure incorporates the ruins of the bombed 14th-century cathedral. He gave his account of the project in Phoenix at Coventry (1962).
Spence had a strong sense of the relations of buildings to landscape, as shown especially in his designs for the University of Sussex (first quadrangle 1962–63), in a beautiful Downland setting. He also designed parish churches, housing developments, apartment buildings, theatres, factories, and office buildings. He was knighted in 1960, and from 1961 to 1968 he was professor of architecture at the Royal Academy. He was architect for the British Embassy at Rome (completed in 1971) and for the British pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal. His New Buildings in Old Cities was published in 1973.
