Du Cerceau family, also called Androuet du Cerceau,  renowned French family of architects and decorators who constituted a virtual dynasty in architecture and decoration from the 16th century until the end of the 17th century.
Jacques Androuet du Cerceau (b. c. 1520, Paris, France—d. c. 1585, Annecy), the first member of the dynasty, was trained as an architect, decorator, and engraver. His major achievements were his published collections of engravings, furniture designs, and architectural details.
At some early point in his career du Cerceau traveled to Italy under the auspices of the future cardinal Georges d’Armanac. The influence of du Cerceau’s exposure to ancient Roman architecture permeates his later work. His first volume of engravings appeared in 1549, and he subsequently moved to Paris, where his first book on architecture appeared in 1559. For several years after 1560 he worked for Renée de France, duchess of Ferrara, on her castle at Montargis, and it was the duchess who saved him from religious persecution because of his adherence to Protestant beliefs. In the 1570s du Cerceau worked for the French king Charles IX and for Catherine de Médicis.
Du Cerceau’s best and most noted publication, Les plus excellents bastiments de France, 2 vol. (1576 and 1579; “The Finest Buildings of France”), is an outstanding resource for many 16th-century houses that since have been altered or destroyed. Among his other published works are Arcs (1549; “Arches”), Temples (1550), Vues d’optique (1551), and Livre d’architecture (1559; “Book of Architecture”). He did actually build several structures, but nothing remains of his work.
Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau (1545–90) succeeded his father, Jacques Androuet, in 1572–77 as the major architect of Charles IX’s Château Charleval. Later, in 1579, he worked on the Pont Neuf, which is his only surviving work. In 1584 Henry III named Baptiste supervisor of France’s royal office of works; it is believed that Baptiste was responsible for the Hôtel d’Angoulême and the Hôtel de Lamoignon (1584).
Jean I Androuet du Cerceau (1585–1649), grandson of Jacques Androuet, was the most important designer of private houses during the early 17th century. He was responsible for the two most typical private homes of Louis XIII’s reign: the Hôtel de Sully (1624–29) and the Hôtel de Bretonvillieurs (1637–43). He also held the title of honorary architect of all the works and buildings of the king and was responsible for the horseshoe stairs at Fontainebleau.
