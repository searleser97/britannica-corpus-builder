Sakcagöz, also spelled Sakçagöze, Sakça Gözü, or Sakje-gözü,  village in the Southeastern Taurus Mountains some 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Gaziantep, south-central Turkey. Archaeologists first took note of Sakcagöz as the site of a Late Hittite slab relief depicting a royal lion hunt. John Garstang, a British archaeologist, traced the relief to a small mound (tell) called Cobba Hüyük, adjacent the village. Excavations of the mound between 1907 and 1911 revealed a Late Hittite palace at its summit. The fortification walls, nearly 12 feet (4 m) thick, were strengthened by projecting external buttresses and by turrets at the corners. The palace was approached through a portico with an outstanding series of sculptures showing strong Assyrian influence. The lack of inscriptional material precluded precise dating of the palace settlement, but analysis indicated that the whole mound was composed of stratified debris of the 5th and early 4th millennia bc.
