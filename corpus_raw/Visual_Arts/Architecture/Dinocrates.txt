Dinocrates, also spelled Deinocrates,  (flourished  4th century bc), Greek architect who prospered under Alexander the Great. He tried to captivate the ambitious fancy of that king with a design for carving Mount Athos into a gigantic seated statue. The plan was not carried out, but Dinocrates designed for Alexander the plan of the new city of Alexandria (c. 330 bc) and constructed the vast funeral pyre of Hephaestion. Alexandria was, like Piraeus and Rhodes, built on a regular plan in contrast to the narrow and irregular streets of most earlier towns.
