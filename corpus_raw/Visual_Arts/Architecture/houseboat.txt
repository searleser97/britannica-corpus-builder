Houseboat,  in its simplest form, a cabin of one or two rooms built on a flat-bottomed scow, drawing only from 12 to 24 inches (roughly 30 to 60 cm) of water and usually with a platform or porch at either end.
Houseboats are found in great numbers on small rivers or streams—especially where there is good fishing—on the shallow waters of inland lakes, and in harbours along coastal regions. When used as summer homes, houseboats have developed into quite elaborate craft, having four or more rooms, with a broad porch or veranda on top protected by awnings. The hull construction still retains the characteristics of a flat-bottomed scow, having great stability. In this form the boats have no motive power and have to be towed from place to place when it is desired to change their position.
With the introduction of the internal-combustion engine, powered houseboats were developed and became popular because they could be moved from place to place easily. They combined the roominess and comfort of the houseboat with the convenience of the cabin cruiser. They are for the most part screw-driven and range in length from 45 feet (14 metres) to 100 feet (30 metres) or more. Being of shallow draft, they have living quarters in the superstructure, with large windows giving plenty of light and ventilation. These types of houseboats typically have broad decks, making them ideal summer homes. In the United States many of these power houseboats are used in northern waters during the summer months and taken south to Florida or the Gulf Coast during the winter months.
