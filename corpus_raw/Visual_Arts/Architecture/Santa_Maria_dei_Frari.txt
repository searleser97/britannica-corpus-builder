Santa Maria dei Frari, English St. Mary of the Friars,  Franciscan church in Venice, originally built in the mid-13th century but rebuilt in Gothic style in the 15th century. This important example of Venetian Gothic ecclesiastical architecture (often referred to simply as the Frari) contains many masterpieces of Venetian Renaissance art, notably Giovanni Bellini’s triptych Madonna and Child with Saints (1488) and Titian’s Assumption (1516–18) and Pesaro Madonna (1519–26). The latter artist is buried in the church.
