KieranTimberlake,  American architecture firm based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that became known for projects emphasizing sustainability, energy efficiency, and the reuse and conservation of existing structures and materials. The firm was founded in 1984 by Stephen Kieran and James Timberlake, its principal architects.
During the first decade of the 21st century, many of KieranTimberlake’s most-prominent projects were at universities in the northeastern United States, among them five residential colleges at Cornell University (2009); Atwater Commons, a complex of residence and dining halls at Middlebury College (2004); and the Sculpture Building and Gallery complex at Yale University (2007). The firm’s projects often involved off-site construction; one example is the Cellophane House (2008), a five-story fabricated dwelling commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
Among the awards won by Kieran and Timberlake individually and by KieranTimberlake as a firm are the Rome Prize of the American Academy in Rome, the American Institute of Architects Architecture Firm Award, and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award. They taught at a number of universities across the United States.
