Pieter Post,  (born 1608, Haarlem, Holland—died  1669, The Hague), architect who, along with Jacob van Campen, created the sober, characteristically Dutch Baroque style.
By 1633, in collaboration with van Campen, he designed the exquisite Mauritshuis at The Hague, showing in it his mastery of the Dutch Baroque style. In 1645 he became architect to the stadholder Frederick Henry. With van Campen he designed the House in the Wood (Huis ten Bosch) at The Hague (1645–47) and, independently, Swanenburg House (1645), Nieuwkoop almshouses at The Hague (1658), and the weighhouse in Leiden (1658). Post’s town hall at Maastricht (1656) is one of the outstanding buildings of the 17th century in the Netherlands. Like van Campen, Post is notable for anticipating some of the architectural refinements of 18th-century France and for the influence he exerted on English architecture.
