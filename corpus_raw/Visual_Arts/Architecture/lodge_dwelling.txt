Lodge,   originally an insubstantial house or dwelling, erected as a seasonal habitation or for some temporary occupational purpose, such as woodcutting. In this sense the word is currently used to describe accommodations for sportsmen during hunting season and for recreationists, such as skiers.
The lodge became a more permanent type of house as the lands around European mansions were developed as parks. The lodge was the cottage of the gamekeeper, caretaker, gatekeeper, or gardener and might be at the parkâ€™s entrance or elsewhere on the grounds, usually displaying some architectural relation to the main buildings. Lodges could be of considerable size in royal parks and be occupied by important persons. Lord John Russell, for example, lived in Pembroke Lodge at Richmond Park, London, by permission of Queen Victoria, for more than 30 years.
