Kensington Palace,  royal palace in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Its grounds border the extensive Kensington Gardens to the east.
The palace was originally built for Sir George Coppin in the 17th century, and it became known as Nottingham House after it was purchased by an earl of Nottingham. Sir Christopher Wren was commissioned by William III to oversee its enlargement from 1689, and thereafter it became a principal royal residence.
The Orangery House in the gardens was built for Queen Anne in 1704, and George I directed William Benson to replace Wren in making improvements to the palace itself. After 1798 James Wyatt was contracted for further design alterations. William Kent painted the ceilings and staircases. Queen Anne died at the palace in 1714, as did George II in 1760, and Queen Victoria was born there in 1819.
In 1912–14 the palace’s State Apartments were used by the London Museum, which again used the site (1950–75) prior to the opening of the Museum of London in the central City. In the neighbourhood adjoining the palace are grandiose 19th-century mansions, many of which are now embassies and the houses of diplomats.
Kensington Palace continues to serve as a residence for British princes and princesses. Diana, princess of Wales, resided there prior to her death in 1997.
