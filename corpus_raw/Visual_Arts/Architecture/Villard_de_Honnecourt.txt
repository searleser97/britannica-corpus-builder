Villard De Honnecourt,  (born c. 1225, Picardy, Fr.—died c. 1250), French architect remembered primarily for the sketchbook compiled while he travelled in search of work as a master mason. The book is made up of sketches and writings concerning architectural practices current during the 13th century.
Honnecourt spent most of his life travelling to such places as Rheims, Chartres, Laon, Meaux, and Lausanne. He visited Hungary in 1245, possibly to work there as an architect. His sketches indicate that he was well acquainted with the great churches that were built during his lifetime. Little mention is made of Honnecourt’s own architectural contributions, although he may have been active in the building of Saint-Quentin. In his notes Honnecourt described the work he did on the rose window of Lausanne cathedral.
The architect’s sketchbook was originally devoted entirely to sketches marked by sinuous figures in draped robes. Eventually, Honnecourt compiled a manual that gave precise instructions for executing specific objects with explanatory drawings. In his writings he fused principles passed on from ancient geometry, medieval studio techniques, and contemporary practices. The author includes sections on technical procedures, mechanical devices, suggestions for making human and animal figures, and notes on the buildings and monuments he had seen. He also offers insights into the variety of interests and work of the 13th-century master mason in addition to providing an explanation for the spread of Gothic architecture in Europe.
