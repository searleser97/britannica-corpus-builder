Plinth,  Lowest part, or foot, of a pedestal, podium, or architrave (molding around a door). It can also refer to the bottom support of a piece of furniture or the usually projecting stone coursing that forms a platform for a building. Tall stone plinths are often used to add monumentality to temple settings and mausoleums.
