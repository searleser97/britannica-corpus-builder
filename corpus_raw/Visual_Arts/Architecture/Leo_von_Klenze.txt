Leo von Klenze, in full Franz Leopold Karl von Klenze,  (born Feb. 28, 1784, Schladen, near Brunswick [Germany]—died  Jan. 27, 1864, Munich), German architect who was one of the most important figures associated with Neoclassicism in Germany.
After having studied public building finance in Berlin with David Gilly, Klenze moved to Munich in 1813; he went to Paris in 1814, where he met Ludwig, then crown prince of Bavaria (king 1825–48). Ludwig brought him back to Munich in 1816 and worked closely with Klenze to realize his vision of Munich as a major European capital and centre of culture. For several decades Klenze was in charge of the building program for the state of Bavaria.
As suited the ambitions of his patron, Klenze turned to models of ancient Greek and Hellenistic architecture, and many of his buildings are masterpieces of the Greek Revival style—e.g., the Glyptothek (1816–30, Munich), the Propylaeon (1846–63, Munich), the Walhalla temple (1831–42, near Regensberg, Ger.), and the new Hermitage Museum (1839–49, St. Petersburg). Stylistically eclectic like many 19th-century architects, he also worked in the Renaissance style—e.g., the Königsbau (1826–35) and Festaalbau (1833) of the royal palace in Munich—and designed the Neo-Byzantine Allerheiligen or Hofkirche (1827) in Munich.
