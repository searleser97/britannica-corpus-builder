Sedilia,   in architecture, group of seats for the clergy in a Christian church of Gothic style. Usually consisting of three separate stone seats—for the priest, the deacon, and the subdeacon—the sedilia is located on the south side of the chancel, or choir, in a cruciform church (one that is built in the shape of a cross). The earliest sedilia were freestanding stone benches, but late in the 12th century church architects began to recess the sedilia into the chancel wall. Often these recessed seats are on three different levels, descending like steps from east to west. The niches they occupy are frequently decorated with rich canopies, elegantly carved arches, and pinnacles.
