The Architects Collaborative,  association of architects specializing in school buildings that was founded in 1946 in Cambridge, Mass., U.S., by Walter Gropius. The original partners included Norman Fletcher, John Harkness, Sarah Harkness, Robert McMillan, Louis McMillen, and Benjamin Thompson.
Among the works cooperatively designed through TAC teamwork were the Harvard University Graduate Center (1949â€“50); the U.S. Embassy in Athens (1956); the Arts and Communications Center and the Evans Science Building (both 1959) at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.; and the University of Baghdad (design accepted 1960). Gropius was active with TAC until his death in 1969.
