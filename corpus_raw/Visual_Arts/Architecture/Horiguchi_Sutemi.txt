Horiguchi Sutemi,  (born January 6, 1895, Gifu prefecture, Japan—died August 18, 1984), one of the first Japanese architects to introduce modern European architectural forms to Japan.
Horiguchi graduated in 1920 from the University of Tokyo, where he also received a Ph.D. in architecture in 1944. The Machinery Hall, which he designed for the Tokyo Peace Exhibition of 1922, was among the important works of the Secessionist group of young architects, who rebelled against the tradition of formalism in Japan. Shortly thereafter, Horiguchi went to Europe for two years, visiting the leading German and Dutch architects of the day. Upon returning to Japan, he wrote a book on modern Dutch architecture, and European influence is apparent in his works of this period, such as the meteorological station on Ō Island. A noted authority on residential dwellings, he designed several houses during the next decade: Kikkukawa House (1930), Okada House (1934), Nakanishi House (1936), and Wakasa House (1939). His major works since World War II include the Hasshokan Hotel at Nagoya and the Japanese pavilion for the Quadriennale (1954) at São Paulo, Brazil. He wrote a number of books on Japanese teahouses and dwellings.
