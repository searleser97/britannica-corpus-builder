Steven Holl ,  (born December 9, 1947, Bremerton, Washington, U.S.), American architect and artist whose built work draws on contemporary theories of phenomenology. Instead of imposing a style on a site, he argued, the site itself should generate the “architectural idea” applied to it.
After attending the University of Washington (B.A., 1971), Holl continued his architectural studies in Rome and London. On returning to the United States, he established a practice in New York City, where he also served on the faculty of Columbia University from 1981. He became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2000.
Holl’s work includes large buildings in many cities around the world, among them the Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma in Helsinki, the Nanjing Sifang Art Museum in Nanjing, China, an addition to and renovation of the Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek (American Memorial Library) in Berlin, and an annex to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. His later work concentrated on urban-scale mixed residential and commercial projects in China, notably the Linked Hybrid, a building complex containing apartments, hotels, schools, and restaurants in Beijing, and the Vanke Centre, a “horizontal skyscraper” in Shenzhen. Among his many honours are the Alvar Aalto Medal (1998), the Cooper Hewitt National Design Award for architecture (2002), the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal (2012), and the Japan Art Association’s Praemium Imperiale prize for architecture (2014).
