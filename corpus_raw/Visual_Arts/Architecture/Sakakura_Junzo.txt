Sakakura Junzō,  (born May 29, 1904, Gifu prefecture, Japan—died September 1, 1969, Tokyo), architect who was one of the first to combine 20th-century European architecture with elements from the traditional Japanese style.
Sakakura’s first outstanding work in an East-West blend was the Japanese pavilion at the 1937 World Exposition in Paris. He by then had been working with the Swiss architect Le Corbusier for eight years, and he continued to be known as the leading advocate in Japan of Le Corbusier’s idiom. Sakakura returned to Japan, which was embroiled in wars from 1937 to 1945, and thus he designed no buildings until the 1950s. Some of his outstanding works are the Museum of Modern Art at Kamakura (1951), the Hajima Town Hall at Gifu (1959), the city hall at Hiraoka (1964), the Kanagawa Prefectural Office Building at Yokohama (1966), and the Shinjuku Station Square and Odakyū Department Store in Tokyo (1964–67).
