Osborne House,  former residence of the British royal family on the Isle of Wight, England. It lies southeast of Cowes and is one of the most popular tourist attractions on the Isle of Wight.
The estate, consisting of 800 acres (324 hectares), was bought by Queen Victoria in 1845 and was subsequently increased to 5,000 acres (roughly 2,000 hectares). The present house was completed in 1851 by Thomas Cubitt from plans prepared by Prince Albert. The grounds were laid out and planted under the supervision of the prince. Osborne was the queen’s private property and was, therefore, not subject to government control. Victoria died there on January 22, 1901, and after her death it was given by King Edward VII to the nation and was used as a naval training college until 1921, when it was converted into a convalescent home for officers. The state apartments and the queen’s private suite were opened to the public in 1956.
The preservation agency English Heritage assumed management of the estate in 1986. Since then Osborne House has been extensively repaired and restored. Queen Victoria’s private beach was opened to the public in 2012, and in 2014 a multimillion-dollar conservation project was concluded at the Swiss Cottage, a chalet that had served as a private getaway for Victoria’s children.
