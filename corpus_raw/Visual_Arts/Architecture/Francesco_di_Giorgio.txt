Francesco di Giorgio, in full Francesco Maurizio di Giorgio Martini, or di Martino,  (baptized Sept. 23, 1439, Siena, republic of Siena [Italy]—died 1502, Siena), early Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, and designer.
Remarkably versatile, a kind of Renaissance homo universale, Francesco combined the bold investigation of the humanist scholars with the conservative lyricism of the Sienese school. His early works were manuscript illuminations, furniture panels, and two monumental altarpieces: the “Coronation of the Virgin” (1471) and “The Nativity” (1475). “The Nativity” shows that Francesco was greatly influenced by Florentine artists of the period, especially Andrea del Verrocchio.
Francesco is remembered chiefly as an architect and an architectural theorist. He translated Vitruvius and wrote an original work on architecture, Trattato di architettura civile e militare, which discusses city planning and military architecture, anticipating some of the architectural theories of the high Renaissance. By 1477 he was in the service of Duke Federico da Montefeltro, in Urbino, where he may have participated in the design and decoration of parts of the palace of Urbino, and built 136 military fortresses. His architectural masterpiece is Santa Maria del Calcinaio, Cortona (commissioned 1484), which, however, is now greatly altered. As a sculptor he is best known for four bronze figures for the high altar of Siena Cathedral (1489–97) and for a series of bronze reliefs showing Verrocchio’s influence. (They have also been attributed to the young Leonardo da Vinci.) He also designed fortifications, battle machinery, and weapons and is thought to have originated the land mine.
