Carnegie Hall,  historic concert hall at Seventh Avenue and 57th Street in New York City. Designed in a Neo-Italian Renaissance style by William B. Tuthill, the building opened in May 1891 and was eventually named for the industrialist Andrew Carnegie, its builder and original owner. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky served as guest conductor during the hall’s opening week, and since then virtually every important American and visiting musician has performed there. The hall was the longtime home of the New York Philharmonic until that orchestra moved to Lincoln Center in the 1960s.
In 1959 Carnegie Hall came close to being demolished, because the New York Philharmonic’s planned move to Lincoln Center left the hall only marginally profitable. At this point the violinist Isaac Stern and the music patrons Jacob and Alice Kaplan mounted a successful campaign to save the old building, and in 1960 New York City bought the building, the money to be repaid to the city by the new nonprofit Carnegie Hall Corporation. Carnegie Hall thus continued to host concerts and other musical events, and in 1986 it underwent a major restoration.
