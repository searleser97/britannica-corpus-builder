They included St. Columba’s, Mayhill (built 1937); St. Bride’s, East Kilbride (1964); and Our Lady of Good Counsel, Dennistoun (1966). His firm also designed schools; housing projects in Cumbernauld and East Kilbride; St. Peter’s College, Cardross; housing for the University of Hull; and Robinson College, Cambridge.
