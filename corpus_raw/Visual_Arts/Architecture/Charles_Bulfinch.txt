Charles Bulfinch,  (born August 8, 1763, Boston, Massachusetts Bay Colony [U.S.]—died April 4, 1844, Boston, Massachusetts), first American professional architect, who gained fame chiefly as a designer of government buildings.
After studying at Harvard University (1778–81), Bulfinch toured Europe (1785–87) and, on the advice of Thomas Jefferson, whom he met in Paris, visited many of the major architectural works of France and Italy. In London he became acquainted with the Neoclassicism of the Scottish-born architect Robert Adam, and he was largely responsible for introducing the Adam style into the United States. Most of his works incorporate classical orders and show a mastery of proportion.
Among Bulfinch’s works are the Massachusetts State House, Boston (designed 1787–88; built 1795–98; extant in the late 20th century but greatly altered); the Connecticut State House, Hartford (1792–96; now the city hall); and the Maine Capitol, Augusta (1828–31). Bulfinch was the fourth in the succession of architects of the United States Capitol, Washington, D.C. Serving in this capacity from 1817 to 1830, Bulfinch used the plans of his immediate predecessor, Benjamin Latrobe, for the wings, but he prepared a new design for the rotunda.
In 1787 Bulfinch helped to promote the first circumnavigation of the Earth by an American ship (the Columbia, commanded by Robert Gray). As a member (1791–95, 1799–1817) of the Boston board of selectmen, he directed the improvement of the local street system and of Boston Common and its surroundings.
