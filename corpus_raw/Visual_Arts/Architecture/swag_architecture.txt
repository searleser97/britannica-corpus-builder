Swag, also called Festoon,  in architecture and decoration, carved ornamental motif consisting of stylized flowers, fruit, foliage, and cloth, tied together with ribbons that sag in the middle and are attached at both ends. The distinction is sometimes made between a swag and a festoon by limiting the former to festoons entirely made up of folds of cloth.
The swag, or festoon, usually carved from wood or marble, or sometimes modeled in plaster in heavy relief, is a prominent decorative motif in all classical architecture and decoration. It was freely used by both the ancient Greeks and Romans. It was also especially popular among decorators of the Renaissance, many of whom also employed painted swags. The ends of the swag are sometimes held by carved animals, such as bulls or lions, or they may simply be tied into bows with the ribbon ends hanging down.
