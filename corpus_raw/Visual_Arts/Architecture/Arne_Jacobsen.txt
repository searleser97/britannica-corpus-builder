Arne Jacobsen,   (born Feb. 11, 1902, Copenhagen—died  March 24, 1971, Copenhagen), Danish architect and designer of many important buildings in an austere modern style; he is known internationally for his industrial design, particularly for his three-legged stacking chair (1952) and his “egg” chair (1959), the back and seat of which were formed of cloth-covered plastic.
Jacobsen received his diploma in 1928 from the Copenhagen Academy of Arts. His first buildings date from 1930, but his first major work was the Bellavista Housing Estate (1933) at Klampenborg, near Copenhagen, where each house offers a view of the sea.
Important Jacobsen works during the 1950s include a group of houses at Søholm (1950–55), the Jesperson Building (1955) in Copenhagen, Rødovre Town Hall (1954–56), and the SAS Building (1959), Copenhagen’s first skyscraper, for which he did the interior design as well as the architecture.
Like many of Jacobsen’s buildings, those designed for St. Catherine’s College, Oxford University (1964), recall his theory that “economy plus function equals style.” The starkly modern bell tower consists mainly of two tall planes. For St. Catherine’s he also designed furnishings such as silverware and china, chairs, lamps, and door handles.
