Manueline, Portuguese Manuelino,  particularly rich and lavish style of architectural ornamentation indigenous to Portugal in the early 16th century. Although the Manueline style actually continued for some time after the death of Manuel I (reigned 1495–1521), it is the prosperity of his reign that the style celebrates.
Portuguese wealth was dependent upon sea trade, and the vocabulary of Manueline decoration is decidedly nautical. When not made to resemble coral itself, moldings were encrusted with carved barnacles or covered with carved seaweed and algae. Stone ropes and cables form architectural string courses, and above the windows and doors heraldic shields, crosses, anchors, navigational instruments, and buoys are massed together in profusion. Contemporary ship accoutrements were turned into architectural motifs. Such vast building complexes as the church and convent of the Knights of Christ (original building, 12th century; rebuilt c. 1510–14) at Tomar or the Unfinished Chapels in the complex at Batalha are excellent examples of this unique style that existed for a few decades in the interval between the Gothic and the later High Renaissance and Mannerist domination of the arts in Portugal.
The profusion of dense ornament in Manueline architecture owes some debt to the contemporary Spanish, to the Flamboyant Gothic style of northern Europe, and to a revival of Moorish style.
