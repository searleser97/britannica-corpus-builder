Louis-Tullius-Joachim Visconti,  (born Feb. 11, 1791, Rome—died  Dec. 23, 1853, Paris), Italian-born French designer of the tomb of Napoleon I.
Visconti’s father, a celebrated Italian archaeologist, fled Rome with the boy in 1798. Visconti studied architecture with Charles Percier at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He was awarded a second grand prix d’architecture and the prix départemental by the Academy and in 1825 was appointed architect of the Bibliothèque Nationale, where his chief responsibility was the restoration of the public reading room.
Visconti made his early reputation as a domestic architect, although he built a number of public fountains in Paris, including the Fontaine Gaillon (1824–28), the Fontaine Louvois (1835–39), and the Fontaine Molière (1841–43). He participated in the Picturesque and Gothic revivals, his works reflecting those fashions including the Château de Lussy (1844), which is modelled after an English cottage.
In 1842 Louis-Philippe ordered the ashes of Napoleon brought back to the Hôtel des Invalides, and Visconti was commissioned to design an appropriate tomb; the result was a sumptuous structure in variously coloured marbles. After the accession of Napoleon III, Visconti was given the task of designing a connecting structure between the old Louvre and the Tuileries. Visconti’s design was eventually carried out but with extensive decorative modifications by H.-M. Lefuel.
