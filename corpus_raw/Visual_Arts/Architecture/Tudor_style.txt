Tudor style,   type of British architecture, mainly domestic, that grafted Renaissance decorative elements onto the Perpendicular Gothic style between 1485 and 1558. The Tudor style in architecture coincides with the first part of the reign of the Tudor monarchs, which commenced in 1485 with the accession of Henry VII to the throne and ended with the death of Elizabeth I in 1603. Elizabethâ€™s own reign, from 1558 to 1603, is sufficiently distinctive to be considered a separate period in the history of English building types.
The characteristic exterior features of the Tudor style as used in secular architecture are: a lavish use of half-timber work; large groups of rectangular windows; rich oriel, or bay, windows; complex roofs with many gables; interesting and sometimes fantastic chimney treatments; and much brickwork, frequently in patterns. The interiors of secular buildings featured richly wood-paneled walls and the lavish use of molded plasterwork to decorate ceilings, cornices, and walls, frequently in a naive imitation of Renaissance ornamental motifs.
