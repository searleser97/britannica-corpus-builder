Ronald L. Mace, in full Ronald Lawrence Mace,  (born August 3, 1942, Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S.—died June 29, 1998, Raleigh, North Carolina), American architect known for his role in championing accessible building codes and standards in the United States and for coining the term universal design to capture his philosophy of “design for all ages and abilities.”
Mace contracted polio at age nine and subsequently used a wheelchair for mobility. At that time many public buildings lacked accessiblity features to accommodate the disabled. As a student at North Carolina State University, he had to be carried up and down the stairs of university buildings. He graduated from the university’s College of Design in 1966 and began practicing architecture.
Mace was closely involved in the drafting of North Carolina’s accessible-building code, enacted in 1973, which was the first law of its kind in the United States, and he continued to play a significant role in formulating legislation that guaranteed accessibilty for the handicapped, such as the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act and the 1990 Architectural Guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
In 1989 he founded the North Carolina State University Center for Accessible Housing, which later became the Center for Universal Design. In his training of architects and designers around the United States, Mace emphasized his belief that accessibility features could make life easier for both disabled and nondisabled individuals. In 1992 he was honoured with the Distinguished Service Award of the President of the United States for promoting the dignity, equality, independence, and employment of disabled people.
