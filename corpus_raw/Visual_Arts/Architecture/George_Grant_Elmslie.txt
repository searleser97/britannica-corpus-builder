George Grant Elmslie,  (born Feb. 20, 1871, Huntly, Aberdeen, Scot.—died  April 23, 1952, Chicago), architect whose importance in the Prairie school of U.S. architecture in the first two decades of the 20th century was second only to that of Frank Lloyd Wright.
Elmslie was apprenticed to Adler and Sullivan during Wright’s tenure with that Chicago firm and was associated with Louis Sullivan as a designer from 1895 to 1910. He may have had considerable influence on the design of Sullivan’s series of small banks in the Middle West. His most notable works were designed during his partnership with William Gray Purcell and George Feick, Jr. (1910–12), and with Purcell only (1912–20), in Minneapolis, Minn. Among these are the Bradley residence, Woods Hole, Mass. (1911); the Edison Building, Chicago (1912); and the Woodbury County Courthouse, Sioux City, Iowa (1915–17). After 1920 Elmslie practiced independently in Chicago.
