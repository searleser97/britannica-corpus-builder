Matteo Carnelivari, Carnelivari also spelled Carnilivari,  (flourished second half of 15th century, Noto, Sicily [Italy]), Italian architect who is considered the most refined exponent of 15th-century Sicilian architecture. He worked primarily in the city of Palermo.
Carnelivari remained fundamentally faithful to the leading motifs of the 14th-century Norman style, considered as a solid and imposing equilibrium of the masses, but he enriched this approach with decorative elements taken from the Flamboyant style, from the Catalan Gothic, and even from Arabic architecture. This is evident in the buildings in Palermo that have been attributed to him, such as Palazzo Abbatellis (1491–95) and Palazzo Aiutamicristo (c. 1491), which preserve the compact, powerful masses typical of Palermo’s medieval architecture yet are graced with interior courtyards and arches embellished with Gothic and Renaissance motifs. Thus, in the church of Santa Maria della Catena (“Saint Mary of the Chain”)—a work not unanimously attributed to Carnelivari—the traditional architectonic structure, based on a plan with a nave and two aisles and a raised Greek cross presbytery, has been refined and made lighter and airier by the complex interlacing of the ribs, which recalls Arabic architectural motifs.
Carnelivari was a subtle master of hybridizations and contaminations, and his work testifies to the long resistance in Sicily (as in other regions of Italy, dominated, for example, by the International Gothic style) to the penetration of the new architectonic language that had been developed by humanism and by the Renaissance.
