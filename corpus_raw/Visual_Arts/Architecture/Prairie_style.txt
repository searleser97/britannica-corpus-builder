Prairie style,   in architecture, American style exemplified by the low-lying “prairie houses” such as Robie House (1908) that were for the most part built in the Midwest between 1900 and 1917 by Frank Lloyd Wright. Among the Midwest architects who were influenced by this style of design were Walter Burley Griffin, George Grant Elmslie, William Drummond, George Maher, Robert Spencer, Hugh Garden, Marion Mahony, Henry Trost, and Barry Byrne.
Prairie houses and other buildings were generally two-story structures with single-story wings. They utilized horizontal lines, ribbon windows, gently sloping roofs, suppressed, heavy-set chimneys, overhangs, and sequestered gardens.
