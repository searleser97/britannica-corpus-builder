Châtelet,  in Paris, the principal seat of common-law jurisdiction under the French monarchy from the Middle Ages to the French Revolution. Located on the right bank of the Seine River, the building was originally a small fort that guarded the northern approach to the Île de la Cité. Frequently rebuilt, it was known as the Grand Châtelet to distinguish it from the Petit Châtelet on the left bank of the Seine. In the 12th century the Grand Châtelet became the seat of the royal prévôt (“provost”) of Paris. The prévôt had jurisdiction over matters of common law, both civil and criminal; judged appeals from all royal and seignorial courts in Paris; heard uncontested cases; and dealt through notaries with proceedings anywhere in the kingdom.
In 1667 Louis XIV created a lieutenant general of police, known as the “monsieur de Paris,” who took over many of the powers of the prévôt and who was granted authority over the commissaires-enquêteurs-examinateurs of the Châtelet. The latter, a permanent staff in existence since 1327, were responsible for security and public order, for the supervision of prisons, including the Bastille, and for the regulation of the food supply of Paris. The jurisdiction of the Châtelet was abolished on August 24, 1790, during the Revolution. The building was demolished between 1802 and 1810.
