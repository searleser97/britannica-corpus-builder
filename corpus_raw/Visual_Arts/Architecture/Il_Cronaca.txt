Il Cronaca, byname of Simone Del Pollaiuolo, or Pollaiolo,  (born 1457, Florence [Italy]—died  1508, Florence), Italian Renaissance architect whose sober style emphasizes planes and linear design.
He was not related to Antonio and Piero Pollaiuolo. According to Vasari, it was his accurate accounts of the marvels of Rome, where he studied, that earned him the nickname of “Il Cronaca” (“The Chronicler”). In 1480 he returned to Florence, where he designed the courtyard and monumental cornice of the Strozzi Palace, the cornice reflecting his study of Roman architecture. It seems likely that he built the sacristy of San Spirito in accordance with a design by Giuliano da Sangallo. His most important work is the Church of San Salvatore al Monte in Florence, which greatly impressed Michelangelo.
