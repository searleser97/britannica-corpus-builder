Mnesicles, also spelled Mnesikles,  (flourished  5th century bc), Greek architect known (from Plutarch) to have been the designer of the Propylaea, or the entrance gateway to the Acropolis at Athens.
The only entranceway to the Acropolis at its western end, the Propylaea was built of Pentelic marble, with some details of black Eleusian stone. Construction was begun in 437 bc but was halted in 431 bc with the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. Several scholars have theorized that Mnesicles—a contemporary of Pericles, Phidias, Ictinus, and Callicrates—was the architect (otherwise unknown) of the Erechtheum. The suggestion is made on the basis of Mnesicles’ fine design of the Propylaea and on his success in adjusting the design to the slope of the Acropolis. The architect of the “split-level” Erechtheum handled a difficult design in much the same way as did Mnesicles in the Propylaea.
