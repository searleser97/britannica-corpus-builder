Pietro Belluschi,  (born Aug. 18, 1899, Ancona, Italy—died  Feb. 14, 1994, Portland, Ore., U.S.), Modernist architect identified first with regional architecture of the American Northwest, from which his influence spread throughout the world. He was noted for his use of indigenous materials, especially woods for residential buildings and aluminum for tall office buildings, following his own dictum of “eloquent simplicity.”
Graduating in 1922 as a civil engineer from the University of Rome, Belluschi went to the United States on a scholarship and continued civil engineering studies at Cornell University. He practiced architecture until 1950, and the following year he became dean of the School of Architecture and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After retirement in 1965 he continued to lecture and served as adviser to the U.S. State Department in South Korea and the Philippines. Belluschi participated in the design of more than 1,000 buildings. Among his works in Portland, Ore., are the Sutor House (1938), the Equitable Building (1948), considered to be the first glass curtain-wall structure in the United States, and Zion Lutheran Church (1950). His other well-known buildings (some in association with other architects) include the Portland Art Museum (1931); the Boston and Keystone buildings, Boston; the Bank of America World Headquarters, San Francisco (1969); and the Juilliard School, Lincoln Center, New York City (1969). In 1972 he received the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects.
