Karnatic temple architecture,   style of architecture employed largely in the Karnātaka (formerly Mysore) area of southern India. Closely allied to the South Indian style, it developed a distinctive idiom in the mid-12th century under the Hoysaḷa dynasty.
The temples of this dynasty are characterized by multiple shrines around a central hall and above all by the extreme exuberance of the sculpture and ornamental decoration. The high plinths of the temples are elaborately covered with horizontal bands of floral and animal motifs, separated from one another by deeply shadowed recesses; a series of divine and semidivine figures each under its own foliated canopy covers the walls. The availability locally of a chloritic schist that is soft when quarried and hardens on exposure to the air contributed to the development of the highly ornate, deeply cut style.
The double-shrine Hoysaḷeśvara temple at Halebīd is a typical example of the 12th-century Karnatic style, though the kūṭina-type superstructure is missing and may never have been completed. The profusion of carving often tends to obliterate the sense of architectural form, but the enormous skill and labour expended are astonishing.
