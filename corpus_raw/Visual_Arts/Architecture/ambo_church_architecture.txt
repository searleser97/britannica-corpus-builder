Ambo,   in the Christian liturgy, a raised stand formerly used for reading the Gospel or the Epistle, first used in early basilicas. Originally, the ambo took the form of a portable lectern. By the 6th century it had evolved into a stationary church furnishing, which reflected the development and codification of the Christian liturgy. By the Byzantine and early Romanesque periods, it had become an essential part of the church plan. In the 12th century, the ambo was gradually superseded by the pulpit, and it passed out of liturgical use.
The ambo had either a single or a double construction, and its position in the Latin-cross church plan was not absolutely uniform. Its position varied in the plan of Eastern religious buildings. In Russian Orthodox churches, for instance, the ambo took the form of steps leading to a platform in front of the iconostasis (q.v.). In the Greek Orthodox church it retained its earlier movable form and was placed at one side. The Byzantine rite of the Catholic church merely used a table set before the doors of the iconostasis.
The typical single ambo consisted of raised platforms on three levels reached by steps and protected by railings. Each level was consecrated to a special part of the service.
By at least the 11th century, double ambos appeared and were normally placed on either side of the choir, with the north ambo used for the reading of the Epistle and the south for the Gospel. Ambos in richly decorated churches were often made of marble and sometimes decorated with mosaics or carving.
