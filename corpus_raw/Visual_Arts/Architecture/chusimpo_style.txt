Chusimp’o style, (Korean: “column-head bracket system”)  Korean adaptation of the Chinese architecture of the T’ang period (ad 618–907). T’ang architecture was first introduced into Korea in the middle of the Koryŏ period (935–1392). In southern China, particularly in Fukien province, the T’ang architectural style underwent certain changes in details during the Sung period (960–1279), and the style was introduced to Koryŏ probably about the 12th century as a result of cultural and trading activities.
The main features of the style are as follows: (1) bracket complexes are employed only on top of columns; (2) a bracket complex is placed directly on the column head without an additional lateral beam connecting the columns; (3) a square piece is placed on top of a column as a cushion for a bracket complex, and other, smaller square cushion pieces function as upper arms, with their sides carved out in an S-like silhouette; (4) the bracketing is made of transverse members only, except for a single spreader at the top to carry the eaves purlin; and (5) because of the absence of a coffered ceiling, girder beams and eaves purlins are exposed.
