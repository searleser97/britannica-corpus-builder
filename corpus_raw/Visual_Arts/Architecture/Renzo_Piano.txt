Renzo Piano,  (born September 14, 1937, Genoa, Italy), Italian architect best known for his high-tech public spaces, particularly his design (with Richard Rogers) for the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.
Born into a family of builders, Piano graduated from the Polytechnic in Milan in 1964. He worked with a variety of architects, including his father, until he established a partnership with Rogers from 1970 to 1977. Their high-tech design for the Centre Georges Pompidou (1971–77) in Paris, made to look like an “urban machine,” immediately gained the attention of the international architectural community. Colourful air ducts and elevators positioned on the building’s exoskeleton created a vivid aesthetic impression, and the structure’s playfulness challenged staid, institutional ideas of what a museum should be. From a functional standpoint, the position of service elements such as elevators on the exterior allowed an open, flexible plan in the building’s interior. While many complained that it did not fit the context of the historic neighbourhood, the Pompidou nonetheless helped bring about the revitalization of the area when it became an internationally renowned landmark.
Piano’s interest in technology and modern solutions to architectural problems was evident in all his designs, although he increasingly took greater account of the structure’s context. His design for the Menil Collection museum (1982–86; with Richard Fitzgerald) in Houston, Texas, utilized ferroconcrete leaves in the roof, which served as both a heat source and a form of protection against ultraviolet light. At the same time, the building’s low scale and continuous veranda are in keeping with the mostly residential structures nearby. His other important commissions include San Nicola Soccer Stadium (1987–90) in Bari, Italy; the Kansai International Airport Terminal (1988–94) in Ōsaka, Japan; the Auditorium Parco della Musica (1994–2002) in Rome; and the Beyeler Foundation Museum (1992–97) in Basel, Switzerland. One of his most-celebrated 21st-century projects, notable for its green architecture, was a new building for the California Academy of Sciences (completed 2008) in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park.
Piano’s projects also included urban revitalization plans, including the conversion of a massive historic Fiat factory (1983–2003) in Turin, Italy, into the city’s trade fair and convention centre district. He designed a number of buildings and additions for cultural institutions, including the Nasher Sculpture Center (1999–2003), Dallas, Texas; the expansion of the High Museum of Art (1999–2005), Atlanta; and the renovation of the Morgan Library  (2000–06), New York. In the latter city Piano also constructed a new headquarters for The New York Times (2000–07). His attention to context brought acclaim to the Modern Wing, his addition to the Art Institute of Chicago (1999–2009), which he designed to respond to the plans of the adjacent Millennium Park, with its band shell by Frank Gehry and large-scale sculptures by Anish Kapoor (Cloud Gate, 2004) and Jaume Plensa (The Crown Fountain, 2004).
Piano’s design for the Shard (2000–12), formerly known as London Bridge Tower, was given its nickname—which eventually became its official name—because of its sharply tapered glass facade. The mixed-use building rose 310 metres (1,017 feet) above street level, making it the tallest building in western Europe upon its completion. Towering above the historical skyline of London, it was criticized by some for not conforming to the scale of the rest of the city. Nonetheless, he remained in high demand, especially as the architect of museums. His later projects included the Harvard Art Museum renovation and expansion (2006–14), Cambridge, Massachusetts; the addition to the Kimbell Art Museum (2007–13), Fort Worth, Texas; and the new building for the Whitney Museum of American Art (2007–15), New York. His portfolio remained diverse, however, and he designed a new building for the Paris Courthouse (2010–17); a school building (2016–19) in Shenzhen, China; a residential tower (565 Broome Soho; 2014–19) in New York; and the Children’s Surgical Hospital (2013–20), Entebbe, Uganda. Piano also rapidly constructed the Genova–San Giorgio Bridge (2018–20) in his hometown to replace the Morandi Bridge, which had collapsed in 2018 and killed 43 people.
Piano received numerous awards and prizes, including the Japan Art Association’s Praemium Imperiale prize for architecture (1995), the Pritzker Architecture Prize (1998), and the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal (2008).
