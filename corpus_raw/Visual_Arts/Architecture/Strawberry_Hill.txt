Strawberry Hill,  Gothic Revival home of Horace Walpole, located on the River Thames in Twickenham (now in Richmond upon Thames, an outer borough of London), Eng. Walpole bought the house as a cottage in 1747 and gradually transformed it into a medieval-style mansion that suggested in its atmosphere the setting of his famous Gothic novel The Castle of Otranto (1765).
