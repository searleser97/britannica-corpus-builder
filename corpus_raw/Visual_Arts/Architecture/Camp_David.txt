Camp David, formerly (until 1953) Shangri-La,   rural retreat of U.S. presidents in Catoctin Mountain Park, a unit of the National Park Service on a spur of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Frederick county, northern Maryland, U.S. Camp David lies just west of Thurmont and 64 miles (103 km) northwest of Washington, D.C. The retreat, which comprises a scenic mountainous area of 200 acres (81 hectares), is surrounded by maximum-security fencing and is closed to the public. It was established as Shangri-La in 1942 by Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who named it for the Tibetan paradise in James Hiltonâ€™s novel Lost Horizon. Pres. Harry S. Truman made it the official presidential retreat in 1945, and Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower renamed it Camp David in 1953 for his grandson. The retreat is administered by the White House Military Office and includes a presidential office and living quarters, swimming pool, and meeting hall. Since the meeting there between President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during World War II, it has been the scene of a number of high-level presidential conferences with foreign heads of state. In 1959, at the height of the Cold War, Eisenhower hosted Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at Camp David. In September 1978, through the intervention of Pres. Jimmy Carter, the retreat was the site of a historic peace agreement (known as the Camp David Accords) reached between Egyptian Pres. Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. In May 2015 Pres. Barack Obama convened a rare international summit at the mountain retreat with leaders from member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
