Juan Gil de Hontañón,  (born c. 1480—died 1526, Salamanca?, Spain), celebrated Spanish architect who was maestro mayor (official architect) of the Segovia cathedral and who designed in a late medieval style.
Gil de Hontañón worked in Burgos with Simon of Cologne, one of a family of German architects who were responsible for many important Spanish buildings. He laid the cornerstone of the Segovia cathedral in 1525, and his son Rodrigo took over this work after his death. The cathedral of Segovia is designed in a mixture of late medieval and Plateresque styles; the spaces are unified under relatively simple roofing.
