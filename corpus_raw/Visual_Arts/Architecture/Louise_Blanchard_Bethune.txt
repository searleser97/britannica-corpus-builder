Louise Blanchard Bethune, née Jennie Louise Blanchard,  (born July 21, 1856, Waterloo, New York, U.S.—died December 18, 1913, Buffalo, New York), first professional woman architect in the United States.
Louise Blanchard took a position as a draftsman in the Buffalo, New York, architectural firm of Richard A. Waite in 1876. In October 1881 she opened her own architectural office in partnership with Robert A. Bethune, whom she married in December. The firm of R.A. and L. Bethune designed several hundred buildings in Buffalo and throughout New York state, specializing in schools. They also designed hotels, apartment houses, churches, factories, and banks, many of them in the Romanesque Revival style popular in the late 19th century. Among their major commissions were Lockport High School, the East Buffalo Live Stock Exchange, and the Hotel Lafayette in Buffalo (completed in 1904).
In 1885 Bethune joined the Western Association of Architects, of which she later served a term as vice president. She helped organize the Buffalo Society of Architects in 1886; it later became the Buffalo chapter of the American Institute of Architects. She also promoted a licensing law for architects, as well as equal pay for women in the field. In April 1888 she became the first woman elected to membership in the American Institute of Architects, and the next year she became the first woman fellow of the institute.
