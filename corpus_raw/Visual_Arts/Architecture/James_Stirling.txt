Sir James Stirling, in full Sir James Frazer Stirling,  (born April 22, 1926, Glasgow, Scotland—died June 25, 1992, London, England), British architect known for his unorthodox, sometimes controversial, designs of multiunit housing and public buildings.
Stirling received his architectural training at the University of Liverpool’s School of Architecture (1945–50). He began practice in the early 1950s in London and from 1956 to 1963 was in partnership with James Gowan. From 1971 he worked with Michael Wilford. His early work was mainly low-rise housing projects in the New Brutalist style, which emphasized exposures of raw steel and brick and the conscious avoidance of polish and elegance. Stirling’s Engineering Department building for the University of Leicester (1959–63) is perhaps his most important work in this idiom.
After dissolving his partnership with Gowan in 1963, Stirling evolved a rather playful variant of postmodernism, making use of unconventional building axes, complex geometric shapes, and brightly coloured decorative elements. His New State Gallery, or Neue Staatsgalerie (1977–84), in Stuttgart, Germany, a combination of classicism and geometric abstraction, is considered by many to be his finest achievement. Among his other works are a building for the Fogg Art Museum (1979–84) and the Arthur M. Sackler Museum (1985), both at Harvard University, and the Clore Gallery of Tate Britain, London (completed 1987). In 1981 Stirling was awarded the Pritzker Architecture Prize, and in 1990 he received the Japan Art Association’s Praemium Imperiale prize for architecture. He was knighted shortly before his death.
