Kikutake Kiyonori,  (born April 1, 1928, Kurume, Japan—died December 26, 2011, Tokyo), Japanese architect concerned with the problems of a changing world, particularly urban sprawl and sustainability.
After graduating from Waseda University in Tokyo (1950), Kikutake worked for several architectural firms and then opened his own office (1953). The work that first brought him to international notice was Sky House (1957), his own home in Tokyo, a building of one room elevated on four pylons. He later added modular units to the structure in order to house his growing family. Such adaptability was among the theoretical cornerstones of the Metabolist school, which confronted design problems posed by a growing populace and limited urban space. Kikutake and several other young Japanese architects formed the Metabolism group at the World Design Conference (1960) in Tokyo. Their manifesto, Metabolism 1960: Proposals for a New Urbanism, was highly influential.
One of Kikutake’s most-noted designs is for a city consisting of residential towers extending down into the sea from huge concrete rafts and containing facilities for aquaculture. Buildings he designed included the administration building of the Great Shrine of Izumo (1963), the Hotel Tokoen in Yonago (1964), the Miyakonojō Civic Centre (1966), the Pacific Hotel in Chigasaki (1967), and the Kurume Civic Centre (1969). His futuristic marine cities were partly realized in the massive floating Aquapolis, built for the Okinawa International Ocean Exposition (1975). It was dismantled in 2000.
Kikutake’s later designs included the Hotel Seiyo Ginza in Tokyo (1987), the Edo-Tokyo Museum (1993), the Shimane Art Museum (1999), and the Kyushu National Museum in Fukuoka (2005). He was an executive producer of the 2005 World Exposition in Aichi.
