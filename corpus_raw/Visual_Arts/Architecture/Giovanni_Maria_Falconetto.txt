Giovanni Maria Falconetto, also called Gian Maria Falconetto,  (born 1468, Verona [Italy]—died c. 1535, Padua), Italian painter and architect. His father, Giacomo Falconetto, a brother, Giovanni Falconetto, and a great uncle, Stefano de Verona, also were noted painters.
Little is known of Falconetto’s life. He studied painting in his early years and worked for a time in Rome, where he was associated with the fresco painter Melozzo da Forlì. His paintings and frescoes are noted for mastery of perspective; among the best known are the frescoes decorating the chapel of San Biagio in the church of Saints Nazaro e Celso in Verona (1497–99).
Falconetto later turned to architecture and worked mostly in Padua, in the service of Alvise Cornaro, an influential humanist and architect who is credited with introducing the Roman Renaissance style to northern Italy. Examples of Falconetto’s work include the odeon and loggia (1524) in Cornaro’s Palazzo Giustiniani and the Porta San Giovanni (1528) and the Porta Savonarola (1530), two gates to the city of Padua. In about 1535 Cornaro commissioned Falconetto to design the Villa dei Vescovi (now Villa Olcese) at Luvigliano, near Padua, an early example of the Renaissance villa.
In painting and architecture Falconetto incorporated Classical Roman elements that would become characteristic of later Renaissance artists. His work in Padua was an important influence on later architecture in that city.
