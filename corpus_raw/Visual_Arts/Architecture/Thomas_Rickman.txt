Thomas Rickman,  (born June 8, 1776, Maidenhead, Berkshire, Eng.—died  Jan. 4, 1841, Birmingham), Gothic Revival architect, whose book An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture (1817) established the classification of English medieval architecture and the use of such terms as decorated and perpendicular Gothic.
Originally a pharmacist’s assistant, doctor, and clerk, Rickman became an architect through his interest in sketching and studying medieval buildings. This self-taught architect designed many churches and country houses based on English Gothic architecture, especially of the perpendicular period. His most famous work, however, is the New Court of St. John’s College, Cambridge (1826–31), which he built in collaboration with Henry Hutchinson. Rickman’s style shows more knowledge of the outward form of Gothic architecture than real acquaintance with or concern for its spirit.
