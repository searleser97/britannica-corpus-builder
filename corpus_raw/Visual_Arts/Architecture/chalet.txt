Chalet,   timber house characteristic of Switzerland, the Bavarian Alps, Tirol, and the French Alps. The name originally referred to a sheepherderâ€™s dwelling and, later, to any small house in the mountains.
The chalet is distinguished above all by the frank and interesting manner in which its principal material, wood, is used. The timber is generally cut into heavy planks, from 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 centimetres) thick, and carefully framed together somewhat in the manner of a log house. Sidewalls, generally low, often extend beyond the ends, forming porches, or loggias. Upper floors almost universally project over the stories below and are decorated with interesting and varied types of brackets. Balconies across the front are common and are frequently embellished with carved railings.
Windows, hung as casements, are small, and in general roofs are of low pitch and project enormously, both at the eaves and at the gable ends, which are occasionally snubbed with a small triangle of sloping roof at the top. The roof surfaces are covered with large wood shingles or slabs of slate or stone; in districts with severe weather conditions, planks weighted with boulders are often laid over the roof covering to prevent damage from heavy gales. In plan, the chalet tends toward the square. Frequently, not only the house proper but also stables and storage barns are included under one roof.
