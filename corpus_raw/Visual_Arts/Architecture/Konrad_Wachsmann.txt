Konrad Wachsmann,  (born May 16, 1901, Frankfurt an der Oder, Ger.—died  Nov. 25, 1980, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.), German-born American architect notable for his contributions to the mass production of building components.
Originally apprenticed as a cabinetmaker, Wachsmann studied at the arts-and-crafts schools of Berlin and Dresden and at the Berlin Academy of Arts (under the Expressionist architect Hans Poelzig). During the late 1920s he was chief architect for a manufacturer of timber buildings. He designed a summer house for Albert Einstein, one of his lifelong friends. After receiving the Prix de Rome from the German Academy in Rome in 1932, he spent several years in Italy, where he built blocks of apartments using reinforced concrete. An admirer of his structural ideas at this time was the French architect Le Corbusier.
Wachsmann immigrated to the United States in 1941 and went into partnership with the architect Walter Gropius until 1948, an association that resulted in the formation of the General Panel Corporation, which produced prefabricated building components. In 1950 he was appointed professor at the Institute of Design of Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, and director of the department of advanced building research. With associates there, he designed a system for constructing large aircraft hangars (1950–53) with prefabricated parts. This project was undertaken for the U.S. Air Force, which needed service hangars for its B-52 aircraft. In 1964 he joined the University of Southern California as director of the Building Research Division and chairman of the graduate school of the department of architecture. His most notable later work was probably City Hall, California City (1966). Wachsmann lectured to architectural students from all over the world. Among his written works is The Turning Point of Building (1959; Eng. trans. 1961), in which he made a point of insisting that technology and art were inseparable.
