Paul-Émile Botta,  (born Dec. 6, 1802, Turin, Piedmont [Italy]—died  March 29, 1870, Achères, France), French consul and archaeologist whose momentous discovery of the palace of the Assyrian king Sargon II at Dur Sharrukin (modern Khorsabad), Iraq, in 1843, initiated the large-scale field archaeology of ancient Mesopotamia.
The son of a distinguished historian, Carlo Botta, he was educated as a physician. In 1842 he secured an appointment as consul at Mosul, in Ottoman Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), in order to secure a vantage point for discovering the vanished cities of Assyria, which were known at that time only from conflicting accounts of ancient writers and from biblical references. He started to excavate at Quyunjik, opposite Mosul on the east bank of the Tigris River, and he might have unearthed Nineveh had he not been drawn by what appeared to be richer prospects at Khorsabad. A week’s digging there revealed the remains of the great palace of Sargon, with its famed winged figures, relief sculptures, and cuneiform inscriptions. After Botta reported to Paris his mistaken belief that he had discovered Nineveh, government support financed further excavation, and the artist E.N. Flandin was dispatched to make on-site drawings of the remains, some of which tended to disintegrate quickly after being unearthed. One shipment of antiquities was sunk in transit, but another reached Paris and the Louvre. Monuments de Ninive . . . (1849–50; “Monuments of Nineveh . . .”) consisted of a volume of Botta’s text and four volumes of Flandin’s illustrations. Botta subsequently devoted himself to cuneiform scholarship and was consul in Jerusalem (1846) and Tripoli, in Syria (1868).
