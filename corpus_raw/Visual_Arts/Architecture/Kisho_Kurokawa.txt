Kurokawa Kishō, original name Kurokawa Noriaki,  (born April 8, 1934, Nagoya, Japan—died October 12, 2007, Tokyo), Japanese architect, who was one of the leading members of the Metabolist movement in the 1960s and ’70s. In his later work he achieved increasingly poetic qualities.
The son of a respected Japanese architect from the pre-World War II era, Kurokawa studied architecture under Tange Kenzō at the University of Tokyo (M.A., 1959; Ph.D., 1964) after receiving his undergraduate degree from Kyōto University in 1957. In 1960 he became one of the cofounders of the Metabolist movement, a Japanese-based group of radical architects. Believing in a machine-age aesthetic, the Metabolists favoured prefabrication and mass-produced architectural elements. Kurokawa, the most radical of the group, became an advocate for buildings with a central core onto which modules and capsules could be attached. He realized this organic view of architecture in buildings such as the Nakagin Capsule Tower (1970–72) in Tokyo and the Sony Tower (1972–76) in Ōsaka. In the Capsule Tower, detachable spaces intended to be apartments or studios were installed on a concrete core, allowing the building to adapt to its changing needs.
In the 1980s Kurokawa lost interest in the radically futuristic aspects of the Metabolist movement and sought to create work with a deeper sense of meaning. When he built the Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art (1988–89), it was the first art museum built there since World War II. To represent the dropping of the atomic bomb on the city, Kurokawa designed an empty circular space at the core of the steel-and-concrete museum. In his Nara City Museum of Photography (1989–91), he displayed an awareness of the area’s architecture, particularly that of the Shinyakushiji Temple, whose roof tiles and general form he echoed. Despite the building’s traditional vocabulary, the museum’s use of glass walls makes a modern statement.
From the late 1980s, Kurokawa increasingly received international commissions, including Melbourne Central (1986–91), an office and retail space in Australia; the Sporting Club (1987–90) in Chicago; and an addition to the Van Gogh Museum (1990–98) in Amsterdam. In his later work he emphasized that buildings could have a multiplicity of influences, a philosophy given form in his design for the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (1992–98), where the curved columns and roofs of the terminal and the local wood in the interior refer to Malaysian architectural traditions.
Kurokawa wrote numerous books on architecture, including Metabolism in Architecture (1977), Rediscovering Japanese Space (1988), Intercultural Architecture: The Philosophy of Symbiosis (1991), From Metabolism to Symbiosis (1992), and Kisho Kurokawa: From the Age of the Machine to the Age of Life (1998). He also was an active educator and promoter of young Japanese architects.
