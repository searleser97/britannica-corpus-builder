Pueblo architecture,  traditional architecture of the Pueblo Indians of the southwestern United States. The multistoried, permanent, attached homes typical of this tradition are modeled after the cliff dwellings built by the Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) culture beginning in approximately ad 1150. This architectural form continued to be used by many Pueblo peoples in the early 21st century.
Traditional pueblo construction used limestone blocks or large adobe bricks; the latter were made from clay and water and generally measured approximately 8 by 16 inches (20 by 40 centimetres), with a thickness of 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimetres). In the early 21st century, modern construction materials were sometimes used in tandem with adobe, creating stronger and more durable structures.
In a typical pueblo building, adobe blocks form the walls of each room as well as a central courtyard; buildings can be up to five stories tall. Usually each floor is set back from the floor below, so that a given building resembles a stepped pyramid. This architectural form enables the roof of each level to serve as a terrace for the level above. Movement between levels was traditionally accomplished by means of wooden ladders, although staircases are now used as well. Ground floor rooms had (and in some cases, continue to have) no ground-level doors; used almost exclusively for storage, primarily of grain, they were traditionally entered through rooftop openings. Most rooms above the ground floor can be entered by doorways from adjoining rooms.
Most pueblo residential groups comprise nuclear or extended families; numerous families may live in a given building. Families typically have several connecting rooms, which are often arranged in a line radiating out from the central plaza of the pueblo. Additions to a familyâ€™s section of the pueblo are generally added above or behind the original rooms. Traditionally each pueblo also had two or more kivas, or ceremonial rooms.
