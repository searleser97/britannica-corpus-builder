Gertrude Jekyll,  (born Nov. 29, 1843, Londonâ€”died Dec. 8, 1932), English landscape architect who was the most successful advocate of the natural garden and who brought to the theories of her colleague William Robinson a cultivated sensibility he lacked.
Born of a prosperous family, Jekyll was educated in music and painting and travelled in the Greek islands, where she studied architecture and history. Her chief interest was in painting until 1891, when her sight gave her trouble, and she applied herself wholeheartedly to gardening instead. Her taste was for the simplicity and orderly disorder of cottage gardens. She worked journalistically with Robinson and wrote a number of successful books, but her great contribution to the art was in the gardens she designed in association with the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. Together they produced a new type of architectural garden in which the skeleton planned by Lutyens was given softness and an added rhythm by her handling of colour and local forms.
