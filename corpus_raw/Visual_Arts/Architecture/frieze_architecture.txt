frieze,  in Greco-Roman Classical architecture, the middle of the three main divisions of an entablature (section resting on the capital). The frieze is above the architrave and below the cornice (in a position that could be quite difficult to view). The term also refers to any long, narrow, horizontal panel or band used for decorative purposesâ€”e.g., on pottery, on the walls of a room, or on the exterior walls of buildings.
The frieze in buildings using the classic Doric order is usually composed of alternate triglyphs (projecting rectangular blocks, each ornamented with three vertical channels) and metopes (spaces). In buildings using the Ionic, Corinthian, or Composite orders, the frieze is ornamented with relief figures, as in the treasury of the Cnidians at Delphi (early 5th century bce) or the choragic Monument of Lysicrates at Athens (334 bce). In Roman buildings the frieze is decorated with plant motifs such as anthemions and acanthus foliage or garlands. In late Roman and many Renaissance structures the profile of the frieze is a convex curve and is known as a pulvinated frieze.
The most famous of decorative friezes is undoubtedly that carved on the top of the outer wall of the cella of the Parthenon, just under the ceiling of the portico. This frieze, which is 40 inches (101 cm) high and 525 feet (160 metres) long, bears a representation of the ritual procession of the Panathenaic Festival and is characterized by superb rhythmic design and faultless execution. It is a perfect expression of Greek sculpture of the mid-5th century bce and is the most famous example of Classical architectural sculpture.
