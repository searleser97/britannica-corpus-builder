Mehmed Ağa, Ağa also spelled Āghā,  (flourished 16th century and early 17th century, Turkey), an architect whose masterpiece is the Sultan Ahmed Cami (Blue Mosque) in Istanbul.
Mehmed went to Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1567 and began the study of music but later switched to architecture. He became a pupil of Sinan, Turkey’s most celebrated architect. In 1606 Mehmed Ağa was named royal architect to the Ottoman court.
From 1609 until 1616 he worked on the Sultan Ahmed Cami, called the Blue Mosque because of the colour of its tile work. The design of the mosque was based on the Hagia Sophia (Church of Holy Wisdom), the masterpiece of Byzantine architecture built in the 6th century, and on the work of his master, Sinan. The design of the mosque is perfectly symmetrical, with a great centre dome buttressed by four semidomes and surrounded by a number of smaller domes.
Mehmed had a book on architecture theory written for him by Cafer Efendi. In it he explained the methods of work and the architectural training of the period.
