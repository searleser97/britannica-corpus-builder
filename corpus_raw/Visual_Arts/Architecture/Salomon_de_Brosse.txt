Salomon de Brosse,  (born 1571, Verneuil-sur-Oise, Fr.—died  Dec. 9, 1626, Paris), most influential French architect of the early 17th century, whose works facilitated the development of the classical châteaus designed by the generation that followed him.
De Brosse was born into a family of Protestant architects. He trained under his father and then quickly achieved success on his own. As architect to the queen regent, Marie de Médicis, from 1608, he prepared designs for the Palais du Luxembourg (built c. 1614–30), which featured a rusticated facade influenced by those of Italian Renaissance palazzi. This work and three châteaus—Coulommiers (1613), Montceaux (completed 1615), and especially Blérancourt (completed prior to 1619)—strongly influenced later architects, particularly François Mansart, who worked under de Brosse at Coulommiers.
His two most important public works were the renovation of the hall of the Palais de Justice at Paris and construction of the Palais du Parlement of Brittany at Rennes. In 1623 he rebuilt the Protestant temple at Charenton, but his most influential church design is the novel facade for Saint-Gervais (begun 1616), which combines a lofty Gothic nave with a classical facade.
De Brosse’s importance as a designer lay in his bold and simple treatments of elevations, facades, and ground plans. A detailed understanding of his achievements is impossible because of the destruction or heavy alteration of virtually all his major buildings.
