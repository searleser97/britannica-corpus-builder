Fascia,  In architecture, a continuous flat band or molding parallel to the surface that it ornaments and either projecting from or slightly receding into it, as in the face of a Classical Greek or Roman entablature. Today the term refers to any flat, continuous band, such as that adjacent and perpendicular to a ceiling soffit, the portion of a wall above built-in cabinets, or the outer face of a parapet wall or projecting roof.
