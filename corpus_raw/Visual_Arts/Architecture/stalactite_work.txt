Stalactite work, also called honeycomb work, Arabic al-ḥalīmāt al-ʿuliyā (“the overhang”),  pendentive form of architectural ornamentation, resembling the geological formations called stalactites. This type of ornamentation is characteristic of Islamic architecture and decoration. It consists of a series of little niches, bracketed out one above the other, or of projecting prismatic forms in rows and tiers that are connected at their upper ends by miniature squinch arches. Its infinite varieties may be classified into three groups, the first consisting of those basically niche shaped, in which the concave curve is the most important feature; the second group includes those in which the vertical edges between the niches are the most important feature; the last group consists of elaborately intersecting, miniature arches. The first two groups occur commonly in Syrian, Moorish, and Turkish work and, in their simpler forms, in Persia; the last group is typically Persian and is also found in Mughal work in India.
Stalactite ornamentation developed comparatively late in Islamic art, the earliest buildings in Syria, Egypt, and North Africa showing no traces of it. It seems to appear suddenly throughout the Islamic world toward the beginning of the 12th century, reaching its highest development in the 14th and 15th centuries, when it became the usual decoration for door heads, niches, and the bracketing under cornices and minaret galleries. The richest examples of the prismatic type are found in Moorish work in Spain, especially in the intricate wood and plaster ornament of such palaces as the 14th- and 15th-century Alhambra in Granada and the 14th-century Alcázar in Sevilla (Seville). A peculiar type of faceted, crystal-shaped stalactite is found in Turkey; this form became the most common Turkish capital decoration. Stalactite ornamentation was also used to decorate Islamic furniture and accessory furnishings.
