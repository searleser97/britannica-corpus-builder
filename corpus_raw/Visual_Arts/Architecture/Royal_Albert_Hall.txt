Royal Albert Hall, in full Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences,  concert hall in the City of Westminster, London. One of Britain’s principal concert halls and major landmarks, it is located south of the Albert Memorial and north of the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. Designated a memorial to Prince Albert, the consort of Queen Victoria, the immense oval structure was built in 1867–71. Sir George Gilbert Scott drew up architectural plans in the early 1860s, but his building was never begun owing to a lack of funding. Sir Henry Cole, chairman of the Society of Arts, subsequently arranged financing, partly through the offering of 999-year leases on choice seats, and new designs by Francis Fowke were approved in 1865. Henry Darracott Scott assumed architectural responsibility after Fowke’s death later that year, and the foundation stone was laid in 1867.
The hall was long notorious for its poor acoustics—especially its echo—but they were improved by modifications made in the late 1960s. Classical and popular music concerts, sports events, balls, and festivals take place at the hall. It seats more than 5,000 but held a record audience of 9,000 in 1906 for a gramophone (phonograph) concert. Today the hall is the London home of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and it is the venue of the annual “Proms” (Sir Henry Wood Promenade Concerts), sponsored by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
