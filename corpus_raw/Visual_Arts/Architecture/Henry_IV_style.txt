Henry IV style,   French art and architecture during the reign of King Henry IV of France (1589–1610). Henry’s chief contribution as patron of the arts was in the field of architecture. Although he made additions and improvements to many of his palaces, such as the Stable Court at Fontainebleau (1606–09), the thrust of his attention was directed toward the modernization and beautification of his capital. Henry was a practical man and the projects that he had constructed in Paris reflect this trait. Planned in 1603, the fashionable and much imitated residential Place Royale (now Place des Vosges) remains a monument to the king’s competence and vision as an urban planner. His objectives were not so much, as is often thought, the expression of royal power or of aesthetic ideals, but the promotion of domestic manufacturing, the linking of the court to commerce, and the establishment of Paris as the focal point of a unified French state.
Earlier, in 1599, Henry had given orders that the construction of the Pont Neuf should be recommenced but simplified the original plans by discarding the triumphal arches and rows of little houses that had been projected. The Pont Neuf joins the right and left banks of the Seine and crosses the triangular tip of the Ile de la Cité. At this juncture he planned the Place Dauphine (begun 1607), consisting of many semidetached units having shops below and living quarters above. In the centre of the square was an expanse of open space. Thus, the Place Dauphine, one of the early masterpieces of modern town planning, is not a block of buildings but a public square that has been integrated into the total design of a city.
While the second school of Fontainebleau was active during his reign, “Henry IV style” does not refer to its style of painting but better describes the building projects that reflect the practicality and foresight of a man of grand concept who did not lose himself in detail.
