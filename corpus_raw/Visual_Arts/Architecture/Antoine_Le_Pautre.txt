Antoine Le Pautre,  Le Pautre also spelled Lepautre,  (born Jan. 15, 1621, Paris, Fr.—died  1691, Paris), French Baroque architect.
Born into a family of architects and decorators, Le Pautre was appointed architect to the king’s buildings in 1644. He then designed the Chapelle de Port-Royal (begun 1646), an austere building that suited Jansenist sobriety. He was commissioned in 1654 to design the Hôtel de Beauvais on the rue François Miron in Paris. This is considered his masterwork because of his ingenious treatment of the irregular building site, in which no side of the building is parallel to any other.
Le Pautre published Desseins de plusieurs palais (“Designs for Several Palaces”) in 1652, a volume of engravings that includes a famous project for an immense château. Among its features are semicircular concave bays connecting the end pavilions to the building’s centre. The bays are contrasted to the convex periphery of the “drum-without-dome” that crowns the structure. In 1659 Le Pautre was appointed controller of building works to the Duke d’Orléans, the king’s brother. In the 1660s and ’70s he designed several country mansions. Le Pautre spent his final years restoring the theatre and other rooms at the Palais Royal. His building style veered throughout his career between dramatic and imaginative Baroque designs influenced by Italian models and simpler, more restrained structures.
