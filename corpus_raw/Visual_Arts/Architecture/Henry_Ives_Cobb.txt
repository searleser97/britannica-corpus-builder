Henry Ives Cobb,  (born August 19, 1859, Brookline, Massachusetts—died March 27, 1931, New York, New York, U.S.), American architect who designed numerous residences and landmark buildings in Chicago, including the Newberry Library, the Chicago Athletic Association building, the Union Club of Chicago, and the main quadrangle and other buildings on the campus of the University of Chicago.
After studying for one year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cobb transferred to Harvard University and earned a degree in engineering in 1881. His first job was with the Boston architecture firm Peabody & Stearns. In 1881 he won a design competition for the Union Club of Chicago (demolished), and in 1882 he moved to that city to oversee the project. He formed a firm with Charles Sumner Frost, a former Peabody & Stearns colleague, and the two young architects soon accepted a commission to design and build the Lake Shore Drive residence (1882; demolished 1950) of businessman and real-estate tycoon Potter Palmer. That high-profile early project opened the door for many more like it. Other notable commissions came from automobile manufacturer Clement Studebaker for a private home (1886) in South Bend, Indiana, one for the Chicago Opera House (c. 1885; destroyed 1912), several buildings at Lake Forest College (1888–94) in Lake Forest, Illinois, and the Dearborn Observatory (1888–89) at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. 
Cobb struck out on his own in 1888, and his business did not subside. Beginning in 1890 Cobb worked for a decade on a large commission from the University of Chicago, designing 19 Gothic Revival buildings (completed 1901) for the campus, of which 18 were built.  In 1891 Cobb engaged in another large-scale project when he joined other architects in planning Chicago’s 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition. Cobb and his firm designed several buildings for the fair, including the Marine Cafe, the East India Building, the Indiana Building, the Street in Cairo on the Midway Plaisance, and the Fisheries Building, which was his best-known structure from the fair. Other important commissions of the 1890s were the Chicago Historical Society (1892) and the Newberry Library (1892)—both done in a heavy sienna-coloured masonry—and the Chicago Title & Trust Company Building (1891–92; destroyed 1960s). In the late 1890s the United States government commissioned Cobb to build the Chicago Federal Building (completed 1905; destroyed 1965–66). He designed a grand Beaux-Arts domed structure to house the federal courts, Chicago’s central post office, and other governmental department offices. 
In 1902 Cobb moved to New York City, where he continued to practice architecture and designed several skyscrapers, such as the still-extant 20-story office building at 42 Broadway (1902–04) and the 33-story Liberty Tower (1909–10). He lived and worked in New York until his death.
