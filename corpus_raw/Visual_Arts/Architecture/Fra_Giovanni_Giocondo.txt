Fra Giovanni Giocondo, original name Giovanni da Verona, also called Giocondo da Verona,  (born c. 1433, Verona, Republic of Venice—died July 1, 1515, Rome), Italian humanist, architect, and engineer, whose designs and written works signal the transition in architectural modes from early to high Renaissance.
A learned Franciscan, Fra Giocondo is said to have received an extensive humanistic education. He made an important collection of classical inscriptions and was noted by his contemporaries for his extraordinary knowledge of architectural engineering. In 1489 Alfonso, duke of Calabria, summoned Fra Giocondo to Naples, where he conducted archaeological studies, advised on fortification and road building, and may have helped design the gardens of Giuliano’s palazzo, Poggio Reale.
In 1495 Fra Giocondo went to France, where he may have helped design several chateaus and laid the foundations and supervised construction of the bridge of Notre-Dame over the Seine in Paris (1500–04). He helped introduce Italian Renaissance styles into France through his designs.
After returning to Italy, Fra Giocondo worked on fortifications and civic-engineering projects in Venice, Treviso, and Padua before being called to Rome in 1513 by Pope Leo X to aid Giuliano da Sangallo and Raphael on the building of St. Peter’s. He was evidently needed for his expertise on statics, as the foundation piers of the structure were shifting and had begun to crack.
Among his written works, an annotated and illustrated edition (1511) of the Roman architect Vitruvius’ treatise De architectura proved highly influential.
