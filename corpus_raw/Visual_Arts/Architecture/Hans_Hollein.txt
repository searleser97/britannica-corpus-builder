Hans Hollein,  (born March 30, 1934, Vienna, Austria—died April 24, 2014, Vienna), Austrian architect and Pritzker Architecture Prize winner whose designs came to symbolize Modernist Viennese architecture.
Hollein studied civil engineering (1949–53) in Vienna before earning a degree from the Academy of Fine Arts there in 1956. A fellowship allowed him to travel to the United States for graduate studies in architecture and urban planning at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago and at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a master’s degree in architecture in 1960. This enabled him to meet and work with architects he had long admired, including Richard Neutra, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Frank Lloyd Wright. After working in Sweden, Germany, Australia, and the United States, Hollein established his own architectural studio in Vienna in 1964.
Early in his career, Hollein emerged as a vocal critic of the Functionalism that dominated much of Modernist architecture in the 1960s. Although he rejected the idea that a building’s exterior should serve only practical purposes, much of his architecture was decidedly Modernist. His first major design was for the Municipal Museum Abteiberg (1972–82) in Mönchengladbach, Ger. Three years after the museum’s completion, he was awarded the Pritzker Prize (1985). Hollein also designed the Museum of Modern Art (1991) in Frankfurt am Main, Ger., and the Haas Haus commercial complex (1985–90) in Vienna. The plans for the latter building, located next to St. Stephen’s Cathedral in the historical area of the city, met with firm resistance from critics who protested that the stone and glass structure would not fit well with the much older architecture surrounding it. The end result, however, incorporated the new with the old as fluidly as has been done in other European cities with ancient roots. Among his many projects at the beginning of the 21st century were the Interbank headquarters in Lima (1996–2001) and the Saturn Tower in Vienna (2002–04).
In addition to running his own architectural firm, Hollein held several academic posts in architecture and design. He was professor at the Academy of Arts, Düsseldorf (1967–76), and at the University of Applied Art in Vienna (1967–86), and he was a guest lecturer at Yale University and Ohio State University. He served as the Austrian commissioner to the Venice Biennale for art (1978–90) and later for architecture (1991–2000).
