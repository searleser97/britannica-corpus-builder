Hans Scharoun,  (born Sept. 20, 1893, Bremen, Ger.—died  Nov. 25, 1972, West Berlin), German architect who was closely associated with modern architectural movements of the 1920s, much later producing his best known work, the hall for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (1963).
Scharoun received his training at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin from 1912 to 1914. After World War I he became a follower of the Berlin architect Bruno Taut, and in 1925 he joined the group known as Der Ring, formed to defend the modern movement in architecture. For the Deutscher Werkbund exhibition at Stuttgart (1927), featuring the work of prominent contemporary architects, Scharoun built a private residence. Among his outstanding projects before World War II were an institution for the aged at Breslau (1929), houses of the Siemensstadt Housing Estate in Berlin (1930), and the Schminke House at Löbau, in Saxony (1932).
When the Nazis came to power, his architectural activities were severely curtailed, but after World War II he served in a number of government and academic posts related to town planning. Among his best known postwar works are the Geschwister Scholl Schule at Lünen, Westphalia (1955–62), and the multi-facetted Romeo and Juliet apartment buildings at Stuttgart (1963).
