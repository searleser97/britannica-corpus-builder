The Seven Lamps of Architecture,  book-length essay on architecture by John Ruskin, published in 1849. According to Ruskin, the leading principles of architecture are the “lamps” of Sacrifice, Truth, Power, Beauty, Life, Memory, and Obedience. Ruskin saw Gothic as the noblest style of architecture, but he noted that over time medieval architecture had lost the power to resist innovation. To Ruskin this loss of vitality was the result of the spiritual decline of Christianity during the materialistic Renaissance. The essay provided a general framework and a moral flavour to the studies of a generation of medievalists.
