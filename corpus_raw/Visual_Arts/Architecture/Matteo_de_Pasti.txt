Matteo de’ Pasti,  (born 1420, Verona, Republic of Venice [Italy]—died  1467/68, Rimini, Papal States), artist who was one of the most accomplished medalists in Italy during the 15th century, also a prestigious sculptor and architect.
At the beginning of his career Matteo worked as an illuminator, illustrating Petrarch’s Trionfi (1441) and other works. The medals he executed for Sigismondo Malatesta and Isotta degli Atti (the first ones dating from 1446) are especially important for their refinement. Matteo moved from Verona to Rimini about 1449. Between the years 1460 and 1464 he apparently visited Constantinople (now Istanbul) at the request of Mahomet II.
As an architect, Matteo was given the responsibility by Malatesta for reconstructing the interior spaces of the Tempio Malatestiano in Rimini, and it is assumed that he executed many of its exquisite and sensitive reliefs. Other reliefs known to have been produced by Matteo in the Tempio were at the Chapel of the Planets and at the Arca degli Antenati.
