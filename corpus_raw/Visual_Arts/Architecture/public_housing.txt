Public housing,  form of government-subsidized housing. Public housing often provides homes to people who earn significantly less than the average national income, though some countries do not set income ceilings. Public housing projects, which usually take the form of large apartment complexes situated in poorer neighborhoods, continue to garner both support and criticism.
Public housing projects are funded in part by federal money but are often the responsibility of local governments. The local government appoints commissioners who form a housing authority. The authority plans, builds, and administers public housing. It not only maintains the property but also decides who may become a resident and sets rents.
The goal of the first public housing programs, such as the one established in the United States in 1937 with the passage of the U.S. Housing Act as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, was to offer affordable housing to the cities’ working poor while clearing and renewing slum areas at the same time. Local authorities tore down crumbling slums and erected in their place large apartment complexes. Though some scholarship suggests that a handful of European and Asian countries successfully engineered programs that provided needed support to residents, public housing tracts quickly developed a reputation as poorly maintained and crime-ridden. Critics of public housing argue that crime and drug use associated with housing projects is a result of the racial and economic segregation that they enforce. Efforts have been made to destigmatize and improve public housing, however, with some  projects offering on-site community education programs, recreation leagues, and, in some countries, incentive programs that allow tenants to buy their homes.
