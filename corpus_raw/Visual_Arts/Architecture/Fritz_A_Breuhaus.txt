Fritz A. Breuhaus, in full Fritz August Breuhaus, also called (from 1929) Fritz A. Breuhaus de Groot,  (born February 9, 1883, Solingen, Germany—died December 2, 1960, Cologne, West Germany), German architect who specialized in interior design, particularly for transportation.
Breuhaus trained at the Polytechnic in Stuttgart and was a student of Peter Behrens at Düsseldorf’s arts and crafts school. In 1906 he left school to work in the design field. He was a popular architect for the members of German high society and became known for his eclectic modern villas and country houses. Breuhaus also designed industrial and office buildings, hotels, housing estates, and home furnishings such as furniture and tableware.
Breuhaus and his work probably would have remained relatively obscure were it not for his interior design projects for the transportation industry. Among the first of his designs in this area were the interiors of the German company Mitropa’s railroad sleeping cars, but his more important commissions included the main rooms (First Class) and the children’s playroom of the famous luxury ocean liner Bremen (launched 1929) as well as the interior of the historic airship Hindenburg (1931–35), destroyed in an explosion over Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937. For the former he designed luxurious yet conservatively modern environments. For the latter he created simple, minimally Modernist furnishings and spaces, with tubular-framed aluminum chairs and even a lightweight aluminum-bodied grand piano. Breuhaus also designed the passenger compartment of the personal aircraft of Hitler’s minister of aviation, Hermann Göring, a Junkers 52/3m named Manfred von Richthofen.
During and after World War II, Breuhaus continued to design conservative Modernist buildings for wealthy clients.
