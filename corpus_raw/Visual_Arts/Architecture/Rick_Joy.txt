Rick Joy,  (born December 25, 1958, Dover-Foxcroft, Maine, U.S.), American architect based in Tucson, Arizona, known especially for his works in desert settings.
Since 1993 Joy largely designed private residences in the Sonoran, Great Basin, and Mojave deserts, among them the Desert Nomad House and Catalina Mountain Residence in Tucson and the Flatiron House in Moab, Utah. His designs made generous use of locally available materials, especially adobe bricks and rammed earth, and of the regionâ€™s abundant sun and sky, with plays of light and shadow. Outside the region, he designed resorts, homes, lofts, and even a railway station.
Joy earned numerous awards for his work, including the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Architecture (2002) and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award from the Smithsonian Institution (2004).
