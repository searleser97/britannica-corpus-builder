Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann,  (born May 3, 1662, Herford, Westphalia [Germany]—died  Jan. 17, 1736, Dresden, Saxony), German architect, best known for his design of the Zwinger, a building complex in Dresden that is considered one of the most successful realizations of the Baroque aesthetic.
Pöppelmann spent almost his entire professional career as a state-employed architect in Dresden, the foremost city in Saxony. He had settled in Dresden by 1680, attained the post of state architect by 1705, and in 1718 became senior state architect to the court of Augustus II (Augustus the Strong) of Saxony, for whom he made a series of plans to rebuild the Royal Palace in Dresden.
The Zwinger in Dresden (begun 1709), the only part of the palace that was built, was intended for pageants, festivals, tournaments, and other royal entertainments. It consists of several one- and two-story buildings surrounding an immense square court. The festive air of the complex is accented by bold, richly sculpted and ornamented facades and gates (notably the Kronentor, or Crown Gate) and by dramatic contrasts between its low arcades and high pavilions.
Among Pöppelmann’s other works in Dresden are his enlargement of the Dutch Palace (1715–32; now the Japanese Palace) and the palace at Pillnitz. He also designed fortifications, dams, roads, and houses throughout Saxony, and his Augustus Bridge (1727–31; now the Elbe Bridge) is considered among the most beautiful bridges in Europe.
