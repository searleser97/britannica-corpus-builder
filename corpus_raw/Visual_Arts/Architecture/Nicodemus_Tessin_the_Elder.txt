Nicodemus Tessin, the Elder,  (born Dec. 7, 1615, Stralsund, Pomerania—died  May 24, 1681, Stockholm), most eminent Swedish architect of his period, whose principal work is the Drottningholm palace.
Early in his career Tessin worked under the Swedish Royal Architect Simon de la Vallee, whose style remained an important influence. He was named de la Vallee’s successor in 1646 and spent several years after 1651 traveling in Germany, France, and Italy. His most significant building in Sweden, the palace at Drottningholm (1662–86), was commissioned by the dowager queen Hedvig Eleonora. It shows French Baroque influences in its plan, gardens, and interior, but it also has Italian Classical elements and is capped by the peculiarly Nordic sateri roof. Tessin’s other principal works are the cathedral at Kalmar, Swed. (1660–70), the Caroline Mausoleum (1672) at the Riddarholm Church in Stockholm, and several country houses for the Swedish nobility. He became city architect to Stockholm in 1661. His son was the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger.
