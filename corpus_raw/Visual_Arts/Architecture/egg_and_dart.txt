Egg and dart,   in architecture, design shape used in moldings. It consists of a series of bas-relief ovals alternating with pointed, narrow, dartlike carvings.
Ovolo moldings, as the Classical egg designs are called in general, are usually wider than many other styles. Their ovals may be separated by other narrow elements, shaped to resemble arrowheads, anchors, or tongues.
