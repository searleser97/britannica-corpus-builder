Donald Wexler, in full Donald Allen Wexler,  (born January 23, 1926, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, U.S.—died June 26, 2015, Palm Desert, California), American architect of mid-century modern homes, especially in Palm Springs, California.
Wexler grew up in Minneapolis. He served in the navy from 1944 to 1946, and when he returned home, he attended the University of Minnesota on the G.I. Bill. After earning a bachelor’s degree in architecture (1950), Wexler moved to Los Angeles and was hired by modernist West Coast architect Richard Neutra. Two years later Wexler moved to Palm Springs and went to work for William Cody, who trained him in the Desert Modern aesthetic, an offshoot of the International style but with a regional focus on the dry and sunny climates of California and the Southwest. In 1952 Wexler partnered with Richard Harrison and formed Wexler & Harrison, an architectural firm that operated through 1961. Together they developed the Steel Development Homes: prefabricated affordable steel homes that were designed specifically for the desert climate and took only one month to build. The streamlined one-level homes had floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding doors that united the indoor and outdoor space. Seven of the homes were built before the cost of steel rose and halted the project. One of the homes (No. 2) was recognized by the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
In 1963 Wexler established his own firm, Donald A. Wexler Associates. He designed several notable buildings in the 1960s (all in Palm Springs), including the Royal Hawaiian Estates (1960), Canyon Country Club (1963), a custom home for singer Dinah Shore (1964), the Palm Springs International Airport (1965), the Raymond Cree Junior High School (1966), and the Standard Oil Service Station (1966). Wexler retired in 2002. He was named a fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 2004, and in 2009 he was the subject of a documentary titled Journeyman Architect: The Life and Work of Donald Wexler. In 2011 the Palm Springs Art Museum recognized his work with a retrospective exhibition, “Steel and Shade: The Architecture of Donald Wexler.”
