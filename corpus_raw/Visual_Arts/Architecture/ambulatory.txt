Ambulatory,   in architecture, continuation of the aisled spaces on either side of the nave (central part of the church) around the apse (semicircular projection at the east end of the church) or chancel (east end of the church where the main altar stands) to form a continuous processional way. The ambulatory often provided improved sites for the numerous altars for saints, which formerly were located along a crowded corridor behind the high altar; the altars are reached through circular arches piercing the curved outer wall of the ambulatory.
The first ambulatory was developed during the rebuilding of Saint-Martin at Tours in France (begun c. 1050, now destroyed). By the beginning of the 13th century the Benedictines had introduced the ambulatory to England, and many English cathedrals were extended eastward in this manner.
