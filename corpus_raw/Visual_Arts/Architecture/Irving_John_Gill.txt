Irving John Gill,  (born 1870, Syracuse, New York, U.S.—died October 7, 1936, Carlsbad, California), American architect important for introducing a severe, geometric style of architecture in California and for his pioneering work in developing new construction technology.
Gill received no formal training in architecture, but in 1890 he became a draftsman in the office of the Chicago architectural firm of Adler and Sullivan, where he learned simplicity of form and unity of design. Two years later he moved to San Diego, California, and subsequently his designs were greatly influenced by the Spanish Mission style. Gill evolved an architectural style based on simple geometric volumes of whitewashed reinforced concrete. He was among the first American architects to eliminate ornamentation from his structures, and the buildings of his mature style, such as the Wilson Acton Hotel (1908; later the Hotel Cabrillo) in La Jolla, California, and the Dodge House (1916) in Los Angeles, have such severity of design that even moldings are omitted. These and other structures display a play of cubic masses complemented by sharply incised windows and simplified interior details. Gill was an innovator in the construction and structural refinement of buildings using reinforced concrete. He was among the first to construct tilt-slab walls (concrete walls poured into horizontal molds and, when dry, raised into position, completely finished), seen in such projects as the Woman’s Club (1914) in La Jolla.
