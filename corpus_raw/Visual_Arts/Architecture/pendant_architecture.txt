Pendant, also spelled Pendent,  in architecture, sculpted ornament or elongated boss terminating the fan, or pendant, vaulting, associated with late English Gothic architecture of the Perpendicular period (15th century). Such devices are also to be found hanging from the framing of open timber roofs of this as well as the earlier Decorated period.
In stone ceilings the use of pendant vaulting was a solution to the difficulty of adapting fan vaulting to church naves built much wider than previously. Strong transverse arches were made to span the area, and these in turn supported the elongated voussoirs, ending in pendants. Intermediate rib and panel vaults spring from the pendants. Examples include Oxford’s cathedral (1480–1500) and divinity schools (1480–83). In Henry VII’s chapel (1503–19), Westminster, London, the pendant vaulting is supported by hidden arches above the ceiling. This type of fan vaulting was also a feature of the Flamboyant period (14th to early 16th century) in France.
