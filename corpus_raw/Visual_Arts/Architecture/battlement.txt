Battlement,   the parapet of a wall consisting of alternating low portions known as crenels, or crenelles (hence crenellated walls with battlements), and high portions called merlons. Battlements were devised in order that warriors might be protected by the merlons and yet be able to discharge arrows or other missiles through the crenels. The battlement was an early development in military architecture; it was found in Chaldea, Egypt, and prehistoric Greece, as well as commonly in ancient Roman fortifications. It was in the European Middle Ages that the battlement received its highest development, crenels being narrowed and frequently given splayed sides, the merlons often having in the centre a thin slit, sometimes cross-shaped, to give the widest possible arc for the discharge of missiles. The developed medieval battlement was frequently bracketed out from the face of the wall, and holes in its floor were provided to allow objects to be dropped directly upon attacking forces.
In actual siege use, the battlement was usually covered with a protecting shed of timber and hides. In some countries, through Middle Eastern influence, the battlement frequently took decorative shapes; and toward the end of the Gothic period in Europe, as the military necessity decreased, the battlement became merely decorative.
