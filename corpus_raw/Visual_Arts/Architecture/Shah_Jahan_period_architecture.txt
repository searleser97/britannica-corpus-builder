Shah Jahān period architecture,  Indian building style that flourished under the patronage of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58), its crowning achievement being the magnificent mausoleum at Agra, the Taj Mahal. Among the other landmarks of the style are several mosques at the emperor’s first capital, Agra, and another great mosque and a huge fortress-palace complex at his second capital, Delhi. The use of the double dome, the recessed archway inside a rectangular fronton, and parklike surroundings were all favourite devices of Shah Jahān period builders. Symmetry and balance between the parts of a building were always stressed, as was delicate ornamental detail. White marble was a favoured building material. See also Mughal architecture.
