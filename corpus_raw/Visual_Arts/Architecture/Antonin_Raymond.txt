Antonin Raymond,  (born May 10, 1888,  Kladno, Bohemia [now in Czech Republic]—died Nov. 21, 1976, Langhorne, Pa., U.S.), Czech-born U.S. architect who is especially noted for his work in Japan. His buildings there reveal that his understanding of and respect for Japanese tradition informed his Modernist sensibility. He was little known in his adopted country but was highly esteemed in Japan.
Raymond immigrated to the U.S. in 1910. He assisted Frank Lloyd Wright in building the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo (1916). Remaining in Japan, he and his partner, Ladislav Rado, built numerous structures, mostly for Americans. One of the few Modernist architects working in Japan at the time, he influenced such Japanese architects as Yoshimura Junzo and Maekawa Kunio. Among his works were the Reader’s Digest Building, Tokyo (1951; since destroyed), and the Nagoya International School (opened 1967), a circular structure serving a flexible, progressive educational program. Raymond’s wife, Noémi, was an interior designer and was also a close collaborator in his work.
