Max Berg,  (born April 17, 1870, Stettin, Pomerania [now Szczecin, Poland]—died January 22, 1947, Baden-Baden [Germany]), architect of the German Expressionist school noted for the huge reinforced concrete dome of his Jahrhunderthalle (1911–13; Centennial Hall) in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006. Berg studied at Technical University in Berlin. He was city architect for Breslau from 1912 to 1913. Also at Breslau he designed the Exhibition Hall Messehof and the city’s hydroelectric station. The subject of considerable controversy for his embrace of Modernism, he had by 1925 become disillusioned. He gave up his architectural practice and devoted himself to the study of Christian mysticism.
