Longhi family, Longhi also spelled Lunghi or Longo,  a family of three generations of Italian architects who were originally from Viggiu, near Milan, but worked in Rome. Martino Longhi the Elder (died 1591) was a Mannerist architect who was commissioned by Pope Sixtus V (1585–90) to build the church of San Girolamo degli Schiavoni (1588–90) and continued work on the Chiesa Nuova (Santa Maria in Vallicella, Rome; 1599–1605 and on), which had been started by Matteo di Città di Castello.
His son, Onorio Longhi (1569–1619), began his major work, San Carlo al Corso, Rome, one of the largest churches in that city, in January 1612; and when he died in 1619, his son, Martino Longhi the Younger (1602–57), continued the work. Onorio Longhi also designed the large oval chapel in San Giovanni in Laterano, Rome.
Martino Longhi the Younger worked on San Carlo al Corso (1612–79) until he returned to Milan in 1656, but his unique work was the facade of Santi Vincenzo ed Anastasio in the Piazza di Trevi (1646–50). He also started the church of Santo Antonio de’Portoghesi in 1638 but left it unfinished when he returned to Milan. The staircase (c. 1640) in Bartolommeo Ammannati’s Palazzo Caetani (now Ruspoli) is another of his important Roman works. Martino signaled the arrival of the Baroque style in Rome, especially in his vigorous and layered church façades.
