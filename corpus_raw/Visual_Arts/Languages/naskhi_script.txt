Naskhī script,   Islāmic style of handwritten alphabet developed in the 4th century of the Islāmic era (i.e., the 10th century ad). From the beginning of Islāmic writing, two kinds of scripts existed side by side—those used for everyday correspondence and business and those used for copying the Qurʾān. Naskhī script is a cursive style developed from the earliest everyday business scripts. It has remained perhaps the most popular script in the Arab world.
Naskhī is a legible, stately script with emphasis on a horizontal line and on the proportions between letters. The two names associated with its development are Ibn Muqlah (d. 940) and Ibn al-Bawwāb (d. 1022 or 1031), both of whom worked in Mesopotamia. A Qurʾān manuscript of Ibn al-Bawwāb is in the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin. From the 11th century ad, naskhī was widely used for copying the Qurʾān.
