Victor Schoelcher,  (born July 22, 1804, Paris, France—died  Dec. 26, 1893, Houilles), French journalist and politician who was France’s greatest advocate of ending slavery in the empire.
Although born into a wealthy porcelain-manufacturing family, Schoelcher showed little inclination for a business career. After a trip to the United States in 1829, where he was horrified by the abuses of slavery, Schoelcher became a dedicated abolitionist.
He worked as a journalist from 1829 to 1848, writing ceaselessly on the barbarism of slavery. As undersecretary for the navy in 1848, Schoelcher prepared the famous decree that abolished slavery in the colonies. He was elected deputy to the French national legislature from Martinique (1848) and from Guadeloupe (1849). As deputy, he worked passionately to eliminate the abuses of colonialism and pleaded the cause of blacks in the Assembly.
With Napoleon III’s coup d’état (1851), Schoelcher was exiled. He went to live in England, where he stayed until finally allowed to return to France in 1870. His reputation and popularity were untarnished, and he was elected deputy in 1871 and senator for life in 1875. For the rest of his life, he campaigned for social reforms, an end to capital punishment, and tolerance in colonial administration. He was a prolific author and wrote many books dealing with social and political issues.
