John Fenno,  (born Aug. 23, 1751, Boston, Mass. [U.S.]—died  Sept. 14, 1798, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.), publisher and editor, founder in 1789 of the Gazette of the United States, a major political organ of the Federalist Party.
As a youth Fenno was an usher in the writing (i.e., penmanship) school of Samuel Holbrook. That he learned something of penmanship there is indicated by the fine hand he demonstrated in 1775 when for several months he was secretary to General Artemas Ward. After teaching school and failing at the import business, Fenno went to New York to try his hand at printing. There he founded the Gazette of the United States in 1789, in time to report on preparations for George Washington’s inauguration. As its editor, Fenno ardently supported the young U.S. government and the Federalist cause championed by Alexander Hamilton, who strongly encouraged Fenno’s efforts. He tried to achieve a national circulation, without much success. When the federal government moved to Philadelphia in 1790, Fenno and the Gazette followed. But the paper never prospered as Fenno had hoped, and its circulation never exceeded 1,400. Fenno’s son, John Ward Fenno, edited the Gazette for two years after Fenno’s death of yellow fever. The paper ceased general publication in 1818.
