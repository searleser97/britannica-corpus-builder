Hubert Beuve-Méry,  (born Jan. 5, 1902, Paris—died  Aug. 6, 1989, Fontainebleau, near Paris), French publisher and editor who directed Le Monde from the paper’s founding in 1944 until 1969. Under his direction, Le Monde became an independent, self-supporting, and highly prestigious daily with a large national and international readership.
From 1928 to 1939 Beuve-Méry was the director of the legal and economic section of the Institut Français in Prague; meanwhile, he served between 1935 and 1938 as diplomatic correspondent for the newspaper Le Temps. When Le Temps and other French papers failed to react against Adolf Hitler’s actions, Beuve-Méry was openly critical and gave up his post for Le Temps. During World War II he worked with the Resistance. In 1944 President Charles de Gaulle asked Beuve-Méry to create a national free press that would replace Le Temps, which had been suppressed for collaboration with the Nazis. For the guarantee of complete independence, Beuve-Méry accepted and founded Le Monde. For many years he wrote columns of commentary under the pen name “Sirius.” He became a critic of, among other issues, French foreign policy in regard to the United States, Indochina, and Algeria; as a result, Le Monde was itself suppressed on many occasions. Yet the newspaper under Beuve-Méry’s guidance gained a respected position in France and the world at large.
In addition to his work as a journalist, Beuve-Méry wrote a number of books, among them Vers la plus grande Allemagne (1939; “Toward a Greater Germany”), Réflexions politiques (1951; “Political Reflections”), Le Suicide de la IVe République (1958; “The Suicide of the Fourth Republic”), and Onze ans de règne: 1958–1969 (1974; “An Eleven-Year Reign: 1958–1969”).
