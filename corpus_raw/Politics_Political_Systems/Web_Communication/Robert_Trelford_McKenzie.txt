Robert McKenzie,  (born Sept. 11, 1917, Vancouver, B.C., Can.—died Oct. 12, 1981, London), Canadian-born British political scientist and television commentator on electoral politics. In the latter role, McKenzie popularized to the British public the word psephology (the study of votes) and the idea of “swing” votes, using a device he called a “swingometer” to show the shifting fortunes of the major parties during the announcement of election results.
McKenzie taught at the University of British Columbia and lectured at Harvard and Yale universities. In 1964 he joined the London School of Economics, where he became professor of political sociology. He soon became a prolific free-lance broadcaster on politics and current affairs. An academic contemporary of Pierre Trudeau, he was able to obtain the first overseas interview when Trudeau was appointed prime minister of Canada. McKenzie conducted interviews with numerous other politicians for the BBC, including former prime minister Harold Macmillan. His books include Angels in Marble: Working Class Conservatism in Urban England (coauthor; 1968) and British Political Parties (1955, 1964).
