Aviculture,   raising and care of wild birds in captivity, for the breeding of game stock, the perpetuation of declining species, or for display and education. The simulation of natural conditions is a necessary goal of aviculturists, allowing them to study aspects of mating and breeding behaviour that may not be easily observed in the wild. As a result of such study, a number of species, rare or endangered in the wild, have been kept from extinction by captive breeding. Some, such as the néné, or Hawaiian goose (Branta sandvicensis), and the whooping crane (Grus americana) are bred and restored to the wild to help build up their native populations. Other rare species, such as the golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus) and the Chinese silver pheasant (a subspecies of Lophura nycthemera), are maintained primarily in aviaries and zoos, where they are abundant.
