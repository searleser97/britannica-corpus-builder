Ostracoderm,  an archaic and informal term for a member of the group of armoured, jawless, fishlike vertebrates that emerged during the early part of the Paleozoic Era (542â€“251 million years ago). Ostracoderms include both extinct groups, such as the heterostracans and osteostracans, and living forms, such as hagfishes and lampreys.
