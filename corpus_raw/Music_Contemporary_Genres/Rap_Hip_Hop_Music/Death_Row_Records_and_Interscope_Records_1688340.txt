Among  the individuals responsible for the flourishing of hip-hop in Los Angeles in the 1990s was a white man, Jimmy Iovine, a former engineer on recordings by Bruce Springsteen and the new head of Interscope Records. Although Interscope had a stable of successful alternative rock acts—including Nine Inch Nails and Bush—its greatest impact came from its alliance with Death Row Records. Founded by Marion (“Suge”) Knight, Death Row rapidly became the home of gangsta rap.  Essentially it was an outlet for the talents of Dr. Dre (Andre Young), former member of 1980s West Coast rap innovators N.W.A. The attention drawn to gansta rap’s violent lyrics tended to mask the unschooled but innovative nature of the music, shaped by producer Dre’s distinctive slurred, lazy studio sound.
Among the Death Row releases to top the pop charts were Doggystyle (1993) by Snoop Doggy Dogg (Calvin Broadus), who emerged from a cameo role on Dre’s own work, and the gritty All Eyez on Me (1996) by Tupac Shakur (2Pac). As the decade progressed, Death Row became increasingly enmeshed in legal proceedings—both financial and criminal—that were reflective of its gangsta rhetoric.  Snoop was found innocent of a murder charge, then left the label. Shakur died in Las Vegas, Nevada, as a result of gunshot wounds—a victim of the rivalry between East Coast and West Coast rappers that exploded into murder. Knight was sentenced to nine years for assault, and Interscope severed all connections with Death Row.
