Blondie,  American rock group known for incorporating varied influences, including avant-garde, reggae, and hip-hop, into the new wave sound of the 1970s and ’80s. Blondie was formed in 1974 by vocalist Debbie Harry (b. July 1, 1945, Miami, Florida, U.S.) and guitarist Chris Stein (b. January 5, 1950, Brooklyn, New York). The pair—also longtime romantic partners—recruited drummer Clem Burke (byname of Clement Bozewski; b. November 24, 1955, Bayonne, New Jersey), bassist Gary Valentine (byname of Gary Lachman;  b. December 24, 1955), and keyboardist Jimmy Destri (byname of James Destri; b. April 13, 1954, Brooklyn). Later members included bassist Nigel Harrison (b. April 24, 1951, Stockport, England) and guitarist Frank Infante (b. November 15, 1951).
The band played New York punk clubs such as CBGB alongside contemporaries such as Talking Heads, Television, and Patti Smith, and released its self-titled debut album on Private Stock Records in 1976. Major label Chrysalis Records released Plastic Letters the following year, earning the group a following in the United Kingdom. Parallel Lines (1978) broke the band into the rock mainstream thanks to hits such as “Picture This,” “One Way or Another,” and the disco-influenced “Heart of Glass.” Eat to the Beat (1979) was similarly successful.
The group’s image was always defined by bleach blonde Harry’s sly streetwise vocal delivery and sexually charged public persona. A collaboration with Europop producer Giorgio Moroder led to the single “Call Me,” which topped the charts in 1980 and served as the theme for the film American Gigolo. By the time of Autoamerican (1980), the other members’ creative contributions had waned, even as the group’s style grew more adventurous, encompassing the reggae hit “The Tide Is High” and introducing the nascent genre of hip-hop to rock audiences with the single “Rapture.” The Hunter (1982) represented a downturn in record sales. After Stein became seriously ill that year, Blondie disbanded.
In 1998 original members Harry, Stein, Burke, and Destri reunited for a European concert tour, and they released a new album, No Exit, the following year. Blondie continued to tour sporadically, and the band’s later albums included The Curse of Blondie (2004), Panic of Girls (2011), and Pollinator (2017). In 2006 the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
