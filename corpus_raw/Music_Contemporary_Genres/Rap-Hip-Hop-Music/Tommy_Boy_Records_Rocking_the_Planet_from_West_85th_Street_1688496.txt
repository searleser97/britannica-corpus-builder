Dance Music Report editor Tom Silverman started up Tommy Boy Records in 1981 in his Manhattan, New York City, apartment on West 85th Street. Producer Arthur Baker helped put the label on the map with hits by Afrika Bambaataa —“Looking for the Perfect Beat” (1982) and “Planet Rock” (1983)—whose robotic rhythms were inspired by European groups like Kraftwerk. With radio slow to recognize this new idiom, exposure for hip-hop came mostly through 12-inch singles in dance clubs, but Tommy Boy’s focused approach to artists-and-repertoire and promotion led to commercial breakthroughs with quirky character acts. Based in California, Digital Underground was led by the eccentric Shock-G, who brought a George Clinton-like sense of the absurd to the group’s repertoire; their radio hit “The Humpty Dance” (1989) paved the way for the amusing and friendly vibe of De La Soul, hippielike rappers from Long Island, New York, whose album 3 Feet High and Rising (1989) sampled the entire panoply of pop and had a particularly big impact in Britain and continental Europe.
