Coldplay,  British rock group whose melodic piano-driven anthems lifted it to the top of the pop music world in the early 21st century.
Coldplay was formed in 1998 at University College, London, with the pairing of pianist-vocalist Chris Martin (b. March 2, 1977, Exeter, England) and guitarist Jonny Buckland (b. September 11, 1977, London). The band was later filled out with fellow students Guy Berryman (b. April 12, 1978, Kirkcaldy, Scotland) on bass and Will Champion (b. July 31, 1978, Southampton, England), a guitarist who later switched to drums. Coldplay penetrated the U.K. Top 100 in 1999 with the single “Brothers & Sisters” on the independent Fierce Panda label before signing with major label Parlaphone. Later that year the band released the Blue Room EP to a flurry of glowing reviews.
Coldplay’s full-length debut Parachutes (2000) sold millions on the strength of Martin’s vocals and such singles as the bittersweet “Yellow.” Parachutes earned the band its first Grammy Award, for best alternative album, and paved the way for the more ambitious A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002). The latter album earned the group two more Grammy Awards, and singles such as “Clocks” helped drive the band’s total album sales over the 20 million mark. Coldplay followed the concert album Live 2003 (2003) with X & Y (2005), a collection of guitar-driven, arena-friendly rock anthems (including the hit single “Speed of Sound”) that elevated the group to the rank of such “big bands” as U2 and Radiohead. Meanwhile, Martin’s 2003–16 marriage to American actress Gwyneth Paltrow earned him celebrity status independent of his musical achievements.
The band’s 2008 release, Viva la Vida, produced in part by Brian Eno, topped the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the album’s title track, arguably Coldplay’s most radio-friendly effort yet, was the number one single on both sides of the Atlantic. That popularity was reflected at the 2009 Grammy Awards ceremony, where the band collected honours for song of the year, best rock album, and best pop performance by a group. Working again with Eno, Coldplay returned with the sleek Mylo Xyloto (2011), which notably featured a duet between Martin and pop singer Rihanna. Later releases included the subdued Ghost Stories (2014), which yielded the hit singles “Magic” and “A Sky Full of Stars”; the upbeat A Head Full of Dreams (2015); and the EP Kaleidoscope (2017). To mark the release of Everyday Life (2019), Coldplay performed two live-streamed concerts, one at sunrise and the other at sunset, in Amman, Jordan. It was the band’s eighth album to reach the top spot on the British album chart.
