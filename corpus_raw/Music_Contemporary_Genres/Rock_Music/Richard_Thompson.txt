Richard Thompson,  (born April 3, 1949, London, England), English guitarist, singer, and songwriter who earned critical acclaim with his masterful musicianship and darkly witty lyrics.
Thompson’s career began in the late 1960s as a member of Fairport Convention, whose intermingling of traditional British folk songs, Bob Dylan obscurities, and haunting original compositions (many by Thompson) inaugurated British folk rock. Along with the impassioned vocals of Sandy Denny, Thompson’s intricate, stinging guitar playing gave Fairport Convention its rock edge. The fatalism of English folk ballads remained a hallmark of his songwriting.
Thompson left Fairport Convention in 1971 for a solo career, which soon became a partnership with his wife, Linda Thompson (original name Linda Pettifer, later known as Linda Peters; b. 1948, Glasgow, Scotland). Their most notable albums together were I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight (1974) and Shoot Out the Lights (1982). The latter documents a marital relationship in the last stages of deterioration; the Thompsons divorced soon after.
Thompson continued releasing solo albums, featuring as always his bitter but expert songwriting and dexterous guitar playing. He scored minor commercial successes with Rumor and Sigh (1991) and Mock Tudor (1999), and he toured regularly. When asked to assemble a list of the top 10 songs of the past millennium for a magazine article, Thompson took the assignment literally, collecting works that spanned from the 11th century to the 21st. Although his list was not printed, it inspired him to record 1000 Years of Popular Music (2003), a compilation that traced the development of pop music from Early Middle English rounds to Britney Spears. Thompson reunited with the remaining members of Fairport Convention in 2007 for a celebration of the band’s 40th anniversary. His subsequent albums included the live recording Dream Attic (2010), the lively Electric (2013), the intimate Still (2015), and the accomplished 13 Rivers (2018).
Over his career he has worked on numerous side projects with a wide range of musicians, including John Martyn, Elvis Costello, Henry Kaiser, David Thomas of Pere Ubu, and David Byrne. In 2006 Thompson was presented with the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards lifetime achievement award, and in 2011 he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). The memoir Beeswing: Losing My Way and Finding My Voice, 1967–1975 (written with Scott Timberg) was published in 2021.
