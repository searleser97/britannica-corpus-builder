Devo,  American new-wave band from Akron, Ohio, that took its name from devolution, the theory of humankind’s regression that informed the band’s music and stage act. Devo enjoyed commercial success in the early 1980s. The band members were Mark Mothersbaugh (b. May 18, 1950, Akron, Ohio, U.S.), Jerry Casale (b. July 28, 1948), Bob Mothersbaugh (b. August 11, 1952, Akron, Ohio), Bob Casale (b. July 14, 1952, Kent, Ohio—d. February 17, 2014), and Alan Myers (b. 1954/55—d. June 24, 2013, Los Angeles, California).
Formed in 1972 by art students Mark Mothersbaugh and Jerry Casale (their musician brothers later joined the band), Devo adopted a man-as-machine persona—complete with flowerpot headgear, matching industrial jumpsuits, robotic movements, and a heavy mechanical sound (including pioneering use of a drum machine invented by Bob Mothersbaugh)—to convey the dehumanizing effect of modern technology. Original videos of disturbing images were shown during concerts to underscore their philosophy.
Following the success of their first single, “Jocko Homo” (1977), Devo released their debut album, Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! (1978), to critical success. Produced by Brian Eno, it was considered their best record, featuring a techno-danceable beat and including a staccato cover version of the Rolling Stones’ “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction.” The band’s third album, Freedom of Choice (1980), featured the hit single “Whip It.” Also popular was “Through Being Cool” from New Traditionalists (1981). However, the band’s popularity subsequently declined, though they continued to influence other performers. Devo disbanded in the early 1990s, though they occasionally reunited for concerts.
