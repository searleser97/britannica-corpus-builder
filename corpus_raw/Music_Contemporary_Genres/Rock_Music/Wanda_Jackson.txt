Wanda Jackson, in full Wanda Lavonne Jackson,  (born October 20, 1937, Maud, Oklahoma, U.S.), American country singer who also achieved substantial success in rock and roll and earned the sobriquet “the Queen of Rockabilly.”
Jackson began singing on a daily Oklahoma City radio show in 1952, when she was still in high school. In 1954 country singer Hank Thompson invited her to record with his band, the Brazos Valley Boys, a collaboration that produced the country hit “You Can’t Have My Love.” After finishing school, Jackson joined a concert tour that also featured Elvis Presley, who encouraged her to branch out into the fast-developing rockabilly genre. In 1956 she signed with Capitol Records, with whom she demonstrated her stylistic versatility by recording a number of singles that featured a country track on one side of the record and a rockabilly track on the other. On her debut 45, “I Gotta Know” (1956), she even alternated between both genres on the same song.
With a series of hits such as “Let’s Have a Party” (1960), “Right or Wrong” (1961), and “In the Middle of a Heartache” (1961), Jackson quickly made a name for herself as a rare and powerful female voice in the rockabilly world. She also achieved international success with “Fujiyama Mama” (1957) in Japan and with a German-language rendition of “Santo Domingo” (1965).
As the commercial appetite for rockabilly waned in the 1960s, Jackson’s recordings increasingly focused on country. A religious conversion in the early 1970s turned her attention toward gospel music, beginning with the album Praise the Lord (1972). In the 1980s Jackson began touring in Europe, where rockabilly was undergoing a revival, and she released several records there. The following decade she returned to touring the United States, performing secular material. At age 73, Jackson mounted a comeback with the album The Party Ain’t Over (2011), which was produced by Jack White of the White Stripes, and she followed that with Unfinished Business (2012). In 2019 Jackson announced that she was retiring from performing, citing “health and safety” issues; it was later revealed that she had suffered a stroke the previous year. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009.
