David Byrne,  (born May 14, 1952, Dumbarton, Dunbartonshire, Scotland), Scottish-born musician and interdisciplinary artist who was best known as the front man of the influential American art-rock group Talking Heads. He went on to gain respect for an eclectic solo career.
As a child, Byrne moved with his Scottish parents to Canada and then to the United States. While attending the Rhode Island School of Design in the mid-1970s, he cofounded Talking Heads, serving as the group’s principal singer and guitarist. Identified with the punk and new wave movements, the band released its debut album, Talking Heads ’77, in 1977. It was followed by releases—including Remain in Light (1980), Speaking in Tongues (1983), and the concert-film sound track Stop Making Sense (1984)—that reflected Byrne’s interest in experimental pop and African rhythms. After issuing the album Naked (1988), the group dissolved.
Even at the peak of Talking Heads’ popularity, Byrne pursued other creative projects. During a band hiatus in the early 1980s, he wrote the score for choreographer Twyla Tharp’s The Catherine Wheel (1981) and collaborated with Brian Eno on the album My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (1981), a groundbreaking collage of rhythmic grooves and vocal samples. Byrne subsequently wrote and directed the offbeat film True Stories (1986), and his contributions to the score of The Last Emperor (1987) earned him an Academy Award. Also during the 1980s he provided music for two theatre works staged by director Robert Wilson.
As a means of introducing American audiences to various strains of world music, Byrne established Luaka Bop Records in 1988. His solo musical career began in earnest with Rei Momo (1989), which drew on Afro-Latin styles; other solo releases include Uh-Oh (1992), Feelings (1997), and Grown Backwards (2004). In addition, he collaborated with Eno again on the gospel-inspired Everything That Happens Will Happen Today (2008) and with singer-songwriter St. Vincent on Love This Giant (2012).
In the 21st century Byrne continued to work in film and theatre, notably teaming with electronic deejay Fatboy Slim to create Here Lies Love, a disco musical about the life of Filipina political icon Imelda Marcos. During the show’s development, its songs were recorded and released as an album (2010); it premiered onstage in 2013. Throughout his career Byrne produced and exhibited art, and he published several books, including Bicycle Diaries (2009) and How Music Works (2012). In 2018 Byrne launched a Web site and lecture series entitled Reasons to Be Cheerful (named for a song by Ian Dury), enumerating hopeful developments in recent history, and also that year he released American Utopia, on which he again partnered with Eno. The album inspired the Broadway production David Byrne’s American Utopia (2019– ), which also featured songs from Talking Heads. A film adaptation, directed by Spike Lee, aired on HBO in 2020.
