Jack White, byname of John Anthony Gillis,  (born July 9, 1975, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), American guitarist, singer, and songwriter who first gained fame with the White Stripes and later performed in other bands before launching a successful solo career.
Gillis, the youngest of 10 children in a Polish Scottish family, grew up in Detroit. His father worked as a maintenance man and his mother as a secretary, both for the Roman Catholic archdiocese. After dropping out of college after a semester, Jack worked for several years as an upholsterer while playing drums or guitar in various Detroit bands. Along the way he developed a deep devotion to Mississippi Delta blues. After he married (1996) Meg White, he took her last name and joined her in a two-person band, the White Stripes.
Meg’s transparently simple but powerful drumming perfectly complemented Jack’s virtuoso guitar work, expressive vocals, accomplished songwriting, and increasingly complex production work. The White Stripes were in the vanguard of a garage-rock revival in the late 1990s and created an energized idiosyncratic 21st-century version of the blues. Although the Whites divorced in 2000, they continued to play together, long presenting themselves as brother and sister to avoid questions about postmarital collaboration. They released seven much-acclaimed albums—including their self-titled debut (1999); their breakthrough album, White Blood Cells (2001); the million-selling, Grammy Award-winning Elephant (2003); and Icky Thump (2007)—before officially ending their musical partnership in 2011.
Meanwhile, White performed in, and contributed to the sound track of, the film Cold Mountain (2003), produced Van Lear Rose (2004) for country legend Loretta Lynn, married (2005) British supermodel-singer Karen Elson (with whom he had two children before divorcing in 2013), and relocated from Detroit to Nashville, where he established Third Man Records. He also cofounded the power-pop-influenced Raconteurs—who released Broken Boy Soldiers (2006), Consolers of the Lonely (2008), and Help Us Stranger (2019)—and the Dead Weather, for which he played drums on Horehound (2009), Sea of Cowards (2010), and Dodge and Burn (2015).
In 2012 White released his first solo album, Blunderbuss (2012), which extended his stylistic reach and deepened his songwriting craft. The follow-up, Lazaretto (2014), garnered mostly glowing reviews. His devotion to vinyl recordings was especially evident on the latter album—an ambitious mix of familiar and unexpected musical approaches—which incorporated a raft of technical innovations for turntable users. The eclectic Boarding House Reach (2018) featured a variety of genres, including funk and rap. Also in 2018 White released the concert film Jack White: Kneeling at the Anthem D.C.
