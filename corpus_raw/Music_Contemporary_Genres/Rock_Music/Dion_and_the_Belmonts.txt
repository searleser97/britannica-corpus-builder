Dion and the Belmonts,  American rock-and-roll singing group popular in the late 1950s whose lead singer was a successful soloist in the 1960s. The original members were Dion DiMucci (b. July 18, 1939, New York City, New York, U.S.), Angelo D’Aleo (b. February 3, 1940, New York City, New York), Fred Milano (b. August 26, 1939, New York City, New York—d. January 1, 2012, Long Island, New York), and Carlo Mastrangelo (b. October 5, 1937, New York City, New York—d. April 4, 2016, Tampa Bay, Florida).
Dion and the Belmonts (named after Belmont Avenue in the Bronx, New York) were the first Italian American rock-and-roll vocal group to become popular performing in a vocal ensemble style called doo-wop, which used nonsense syllables sung like musical instruments in accompaniment to the lead. The success of Dion and the Belmonts’ first record, “I Wonder Why” (1958), employing an exotic falsetto and a prominent bass, was largely limited to the Middle Atlantic states, which were then undergoing a doo-wop revival spearheaded by Italian American groups. The group’s original members performed together only from 1958 to 1960 but attained national success with “A Teenager in Love” (1959) and “Where or When” (1960).
In 1960 DiMucci left the group and, as Dion, forged a substantial career as a solo singer with such notable records as “Runaround Sue” and “The Wanderer” (both 1961), “Lovers Who Wander” (1962), and “Abraham, Martin, and John” (1968). The Belmonts without DiMucci experienced short-lived success during 1961–63, notably with “Come On Little Angel” (1963), and continued to perform and record together. DiMucci rejoined them periodically in the 1960s and ’70s.
In 1988 DiMucci wrote his autobiography, The Wanderer: Dion’s Story. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989.
