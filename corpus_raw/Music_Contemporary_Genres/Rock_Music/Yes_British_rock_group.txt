Yes,  British progressive rock band known for its extended compositions and virtuoso musicianship. Its principal members were Jon Anderson (b. October 25, 1944, Accrington, Lancashire, England), Chris Squire (b. March 4, 1948, London, England—d. June 27, 2015, Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.), Steve Howe (b. April 8, 1947, London), Rick Wakeman (b. May 18, 1949, London), and Alan White (b. June 14, 1949, Pelton, Durham, England). Other members included Bill Bruford (b. May 17, 1949, Sevenoaks, Kent, England), Patrick Moraz (b. June 24, 1948, Morges, Switzerland), and Trevor Rabin (b. January 13, 1954, Johannesburg, South Africa).
Founded in 1968 by vocalist Anderson and bassist Squire, Yes went through several early personnel changes before stabilizing around Anderson, guitarist Howe, Squire, and keyboardist Wakeman, all of whom played on the group’s fourth album, Fragile (1972). Featuring the hit “Roundabout,” the album established Yes as one of progressive rock’s leading bands, rivaled only by Genesis and Emerson, Lake and Palmer. Fragile also marked the beginning of Yes’s relationship with artist Roger Dean, whose album covers and stage designs defined the group’s visual style. Their sound, which featured Anderson’s falsetto vocals and Howe’s complex guitar supported by Squire’s bass and Wakeman’s multilayered keyboards, further developed with Close to the Edge (1972) and Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973).
Wakeman’s departure in 1974 marked the beginning of several years’ increasing instability, as members dropped out or concentrated on solo projects (only Squire remained with the band from its founding). Despite a changing lineup, Yes released four more albums before dissolving in 1981. It reconvened two years later under the leadership of guitarist Trevor Rabin. This incarnation, which featured Anderson, Squire, and White, enjoyed commercial success with 90125 (1983), a collection that included the hit single “Owner of a Lonely Heart,” and Big Generator (1987); the creation of another group by other Yes veterans (including Bruford, Howe, and Wakeman) led to legal wrangling over ownership of the band’s name. The dispute, which was settled by 1991, showed that even though (like many progressive rock bands) it lacked the energy and vision of its youth, Yes had evolved from an avant-garde experiment into a valuable commercial franchise that continued performing and recording into the 21st century. Yes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017.
