Gang of Four,  British rock group known for its Marxist politics and danceable fusion of rock and funk. The principal members were Jon King (b. June 8, 1955, London, England), Andy Gill (b. January 1, 1956, Manchester–d. February 1, 2020), Hugo Burnham (b. March 25, 1956, London), and Dave Allen (b. December 23, 1955, Kendal, Cumbria).
Formed in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, in 1977 by a group of leftist university students and taking its name from the Chinese ruling cadre led by Mao Zedong’s widow, the Gang of Four forged a distinctive sound that incorporated elements of punk, disco, and Jimi Hendrix-influenced guitar distortion. The band made its recording debut in 1978 with Damaged Goods, an extended-play record that featured Gill’s stuttering, jerky guitar; it was followed in 1979 by Entertainment!, which continued the group’s movement toward the dance floor, propelled by bassist Allen and drummer Burnham. The Gang of Four’s songs, often of an ironic and theoretical bent, focused on sexual politics and the bleakness of consumerism. The group’s third album, Songs of the Free, released during the Falkland Islands War (1982), was more accessible and even more dance-oriented than its predecessors but included the antimilitarist “I Love a Man in Uniform” and the dour “We Live as We Dream, Alone.” Critically but not commercially successful, the group broke up in 1984 and was re-formed by Gill and vocalist King in 1990 and again in 1995.
