Pearl Jam,  American band that helped popularize grunge music in the early 1990s and that continued to be a respected alternative rock group into the 21st century. The original members were lead vocalist Eddie Vedder (original name Edward Louis Severson III; b. December 23, 1964, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.), rhythm guitarist Stone Gossard (b. July 20, 1966, Seattle, Washington), bassist Jeff Ament (b. March 10, 1963, Havre, Montana), lead guitarist Mike McCready (b. April 5, 1966, Pensacola, Florida), and drummer Dave Krusen (b. March 10, 1966, Tacoma, Washington). Later members included Jack Irons (b. July 18, 1962, Los Angeles, California), Dave Abbruzzese (b. May 17, 1968, Stamford, Connecticut), and Matt Cameron (b. November 28, 1962, San Diego, California).
Pearl Jam came into being in Seattle in 1990 when Gossard and Ament of the glam-influenced rock combo Mother Love Bone decided to form a new band following the death of their group’s lead singer, Andrew Wood. The band was originally named Mookie Blaylock, after a professional basketball player, but settled on the words pearl and jam separately—the latter reportedly after seeing musician Neil Young in concert and admiring his “jam session” style. The band released its first album, Ten, in 1991. Alternative rock had already begun to receive mainstream acceptance, thanks largely to the popularity of Nirvana—who, like Pearl Jam, were part of Seattle’s vibrant music scene—and Ten (featuring the major hits “Jeremy,” “Evenflow,” and “Alive”) became a multimillion-seller.
With angry stadium-style rock highlighted by Vedder’s impassioned baritone vocals, Pearl Jam joined Nirvana as the musical voice of Generation X. The group also earned a reputation for resisting the mainstream music industry. Notably, they refused to produce music videos for any of the songs on their second album, Vs (1993), and in 1994 they canceled a tour as the result of a heated battle over ticket prices. Instead, the band scheduled concerts at venues that were much smaller than the stadiums they usually played and experimented with unorthodox ticket distribution techniques.
Vitalogy (1994), the group’s third multimillion-selling album, explored longing and loss, and it included the Grammy-winning single “Spin the Black Circle.” Pearl Jam backed Neil Young on Mirror Ball (1995), then released No Code (1996), whose stylistic departure disappointed some fans. Despite good reviews, Yield (1998) and Binaural (2000) were not commercial successes. Pearl Jam, however, remained a popular concert draw, and its 2000 European tour was chronicled on 25 live and unedited CDs. The politically charged Riot Act (2002) was a solid rock album, but its intensity did not approach the eponymous Pearl Jam (2006). Critics and fans embraced the return to the arena-rock sound of Vs, and singles like “World Wide Suicide” recalled the anger and urgency of “Jeremy.”
In 2007 Vedder made his solo debut with Into the Wild, the score for the Sean Penn film of the same name. The film recounted the true story of a young man who turned his back on society to live in the Alaska wilderness, and Vedder’s award-winning soundtrack captured the mood with stripped-down instrumentation and lyrics that recalled traditional American roots ballads. His second solo effort, Ukulele Songs, appeared in 2011.
The band debuted its 2009 album, Backspacer, on the social networking site MySpace, and it was one of the first releases to take advantage of Apple’s iTunes LP format—a software enhancement meant to more closely replicate the experience of a physical album by offering liner notes, lyric sheets, and photographs of the band. In 2013 they released their 10th studio album, Lightning Bolt, which claimed the top spot on Billboard’s album chart. On Gigaton (2020), the band inveighed against the dangers of climate change. They were also known for their concert albums, which included Live on Ten Legs (2011), a collection of concert highlights from 2003 to 2010, and Let’s Play Two (2017), a CD/DVD commemorating the band’s pair of 2016 concerts in Chicago’s Wrigley Field. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017.
