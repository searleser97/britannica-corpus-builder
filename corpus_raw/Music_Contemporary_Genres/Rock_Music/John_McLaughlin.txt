John McLaughlin,  (born January 4, 1942, Yorkshire, England), English-born guitar virtuoso and bandleader whose extremely loud, highly energetic, eclectic soloing made him one of the most popular and influential jazz-rock musicians.
McLaughlin began his career playing blues and rock in London in the early 1960s and went on to play free jazz with important British figures before moving to the United States in 1969. There he contributed rock- and blues-derived guitar passages to Miles Davis’s early fusion albums In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew (both 1969) and played in Tony Williams’s seminal jazz-rock trio Lifetime. In 1970 he became a disciple of spiritual guru Sri Chinmoy; he acquired the name Mahavishnu and formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1971. The Orchestra was initially a quintet noted for radically high volume levels, complex textures, and fast modal playing, especially by McLaughlin, in long passages of 16th-note scales and arpeggios, on a guitar with two parallel necks, one with 6 strings, the other with 12. They played concerts in rock, rather than jazz, venues and were among the handful of stars of jazz-rock fusion music; they recorded popular albums such as The Inner Mounting Flame (1971) and Visions of the Emerald Beyond (1975). The involvement of electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty in 1974–75 enhanced the Orchestra’s popularity.
In the mid-1970s McLaughlin left Chinmoy, abandoned the name Mahavishnu, and began playing acoustic guitar in his trio Shakti, with Indian violinist L. Shankar and tabla player Zakir Hussain. His new guitar had two fretboards, one with raised strings crossing the other. McLaughlin’s improvising—with phrases from blues, rock (especially Jimi Hendrix), flamenco, jazz, and Indian music—fit readily into a variety of fusion music. He went on to play duets and trios with fellow guitar virtuosos Al DiMeola, Paco de Lucía, and Larry Coryell, to team with Indian percussionist Trilok Gurtu, to play electric guitar in a revived Mahavishnu Orchestra in the mid-1980s, and to perform guitar concerti by Mike Gibbs (1985) and by himself (1990) with symphony orchestras.
McLaughlin recorded an acoustic homage to jazz pianist Bill Evans in 1993, and he returned to the electric guitar for After the Rain (1994) and The Promise (1995). His inventiveness remained undiminished in the 21st century. He revived Shakti for the live album Saturday Night in Bombay (2001). Other notable later works included Industrial Zen (2006); Floating Point (2008); Five Peace Band Live (2009), which won a Grammy Award for best jazz instrumental album; Now Here This (2012); and Black Light (2015). His recording of “Miles Beyond,” from the 2017 album Live at Ronnie Scott’s, took the Grammy for best improvised jazz solo. In 2017 McLaughlin began what he said was his final tour, performing music from the various incarnations of the Mahavishnu Orchestra. He reunited with Zakir Hussain and also collaborated with Indian composer and singer Shankar Mahadevan for Is That So? (2020), a collection of Indian devotional songs that melds classical Indian music with world jazz.
