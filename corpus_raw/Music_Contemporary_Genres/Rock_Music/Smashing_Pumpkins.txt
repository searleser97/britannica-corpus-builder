Smashing Pumpkins,  American band, one of the most popular and influential alternative rock groups of the 1990s. Founded by guitarist and songwriter Billy Corgan (in full William Patrick Corgan; b. March 17, 1967, Elk Grove, Illinois, U.S.) in Chicago in 1988, the Smashing Pumpkins created a postpunk blend of progressive rock, grunge, and psychedelia that incorporated the brooding atmospherics of goth rock and the adventurous melodiousness of “dream pop” bands such as the Cocteau Twins. In addition to Corgan, the band’s founding members were guitarist James Iha (in full James Yoshinobu Iha; b. March 26, 1968, Chicago), bassist D’Arcy (byname of D’Arcy Elizabeth Wretzky; b. May 1, 1968, South Haven, Michigan), and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin (in full James Joseph Chamberlin; b. June 10, 1964, Joliet, Illinois).
Although the group found success with its debut single, “I Am One” (1990), it was the band’s debut album, Gish (1991), with its arena-ready anthems, multitracked guitars, and high melodrama, that helped transform the rock landscape of the 1990s. The Smashing Pumpkins got even bigger with the release of their second album, the multiplatinum Siamese Dream (1993), which featured the hits “Cherub Rock,” “Today,” and “Disarm.” The subsequent double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995) debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart on the way to selling more than four million copies in the United States and earning six Grammy Award nominations; they won best hard rock performance for the single “Bullet with Butterfly Wings.” They also received that award for “The End Is the Beginning Is the End,” from the soundtrack for the film Batman & Robin (1997).
The Smashing Pumpkins were at the peak of their popularity when Jonathan Melvoin, the band’s touring keyboardist, died of a heroin overdose. Thereafter, matters worsened as the band experienced a series of lineup changes. Adore (1998) not only met with mixed reviews but sold poorly, and MACHINA/The Machines of God (2000) sounded as if Corgan were going it alone, which he was by December 2000, when the group broke up. A parting shot, Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music (2000), was distributed exclusively to select fans who, with Corgan’s encouragement, made it available on the Internet to be downloaded for free.
In 2005 Corgan and Chamberlin, who had played together briefly in another band, Zwan, announced that the Smashing Pumpkins were reuniting; however, they were the only original members who performed on the subsequent release, Zeitgeist (2007). After Chamberlin left the group in 2009, Corgan began to assemble a new Smashing Pumpkins lineup for Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, a thematically unified collection of songs that he announced would be released online one at a time and periodically compiled onto physical releases. The new incarnation of the band produced three EPs (2010–11) for the project before releasing two related full-length albums, Oceania (2012) and Monuments to an Elegy (2014). Chamberlin and Iha rejoined the Smashing Pumpkins for a tour that began in 2018, and that line-up recorded Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1: No Past. No Future. No Sun (2018) and Cyr (2020).
