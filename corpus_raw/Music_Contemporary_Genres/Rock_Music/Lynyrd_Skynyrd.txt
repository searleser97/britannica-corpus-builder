Lynyrd Skynyrd ,  American rock band that rose to prominence during the Southern rock boom of the 1970s on the strength of its triple-guitar attack and gritty working-class attitude. The principal members were Ronnie Van Zant (b. January 15, 1949, Jacksonville, Florida, U.S.—d. October 20, 1977, Gillsburg, Mississippi), Gary Rossington (b. December 4, 1951, Jacksonville), Allen Collins (b. July 19, 1952, Jacksonville—d. January 23, 1990, Jacksonville), Steve Gaines (b. September 14, 1949, Seneca, Missouri—d. October 20, 1977, Gillsburg), Billy Powell (b. June 3, 1952, Jacksonville—d. January 28, 2009, Orange Park, Florida), Leon Wilkeson (b. April 2, 1952—d. July 27, 2001, Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida), Bob Burns (b. November 24, 1950, Jacksonville, Florida—d. April 3, 2015, Cartersville, Georgia), and Artimus Pyle (b. July 15, 1948, Louisville, Kentucky).
After playing under various names in Jacksonville, the group settled on Lynyrd Skynyrd (a backhanded compliment to a high-school gym teacher notorious for his opposition to long hair). In 1973 they released their first album, Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd. “Free Bird,” a tribute to the late Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band, was an immediate sensation, thanks to the interplay of its three lead guitars, while “Sweet Home Alabama,” a response to Neil Young’s derisive “Southern Man,” opened Second Helping (1974) and established the group as Southern rock stalwarts. In 1977, as Skynyrd’s success was increasing, a plane carrying the band crashed in Gillsburg, Mississippi, killing singer Van Zant and guitarist Gaines. The group disbanded.
Surviving members reunited in 1987, with Van Zant’s younger brother, Johnny, singing lead. The new Skynyrd was embraced by a number of country singers, especially Travis Tritt. In 2006 Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
