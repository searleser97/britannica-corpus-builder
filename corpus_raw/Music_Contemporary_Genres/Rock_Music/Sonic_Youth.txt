Sonic Youth,  American avant-garde noise band and highly influential forerunner of the alternative rock groups of the 1980s and ’90s. The principal members were Kim Gordon (b. April 28, 1953, Rochester, New York, U.S.), Lee Ranaldo (b. February 3, 1956, Glen Cove, New York), Thurston Moore (b. July 25, 1958, Coral Gables, Florida), and Steve Shelley (b. June 23, 1962, Midland, Michigan).
Moore and Ranaldo met in New York City in the late 1970s, at the height of the postpunk “no wave” movement (dissonant, noisy, experimental music generally created by untrained musicians). Both performed in the guitar orchestras of avant-garde composer Glenn Branca. In 1981 Sonic Youth formed, with Moore and Ranaldo on guitar and Moore’s girlfriend (later wife) Gordon on bass; the band went through a succession of drummers before Shelley became a fixture by 1986. The group’s first recordings were heavy on noise and feedback, but, by the release of Bad Moon Rising in 1985, it was clear Sonic Youth was beginning to find its own voice. The band still specialized in creating mammoth walls of sound, but the rhythmic underpinnings gave the songs a greater sense of structure. This evolution led to the double album Daydream Nation (1988), which is generally regarded as the band’s masterpiece.
The group eventually signed with a major label, DGC, but retained its underground edge and penchant for musical experimentation, which ranged from the straightforward pop approach of Goo (1990) and Dirty (1992) to the near-orchestral sweep of Washing Machine (1995) and A Thousand Leaves (1998). Beginning in 1997, the group released a series of experimental albums on its own SYR label, one of which was a collaboration with polymath musician Jim O’Rourke (b. January 18, 1969, Chicago, Illinois). After helping to produce NYC Ghosts and Flowers (2000), a paean to avant-garde composers like John Cage, O’Rourke became a full-time member of Sonic Youth, appearing on tour and handling production duties for Murray Street (2002) and Sonic Nurse (2004). Although O’Rourke departed in 2005, the 2006 album Rather Ripped retained his influence.
With the conclusion of its contract with DGC, the group signed with independent label Matador for the 2009 release The Eternal. Enlisting Pavement bassist Mark Ibold (b. 1962, Cincinnati, Ohio) for the album and subsequent tour, The Eternal recalled Sonic Youth’s early 1990s rock sound. It proved to be a final statement. In 2011 the 27-year marriage of Gordon and Moore dissolved, which effectively brought an end to the band as well. Throughout Sonic Youth’s existence, each member had also been involved in a wide variety of side projects, and they continued their individual musical pursuits thereafter.
