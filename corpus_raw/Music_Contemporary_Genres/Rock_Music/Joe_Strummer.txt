Joe Strummer, original name John Graham Mellor,  (born August 21, 1952, Ankara, Turkey—died December 22, 2002, Broomfield, Somerset, England), British punk rock star who gave voice to a generation of unrest as the leader of the Clash. The band’s passionate politicized sounds were largely due to Strummer’s commitment to a populist ideology.
Strummer formed his first rhythm-and-blues band, the 101ers, in 1974. Influenced by the Sex Pistols, Strummer converted to punk, and in 1976 he joined several other musicians, including Mick Jones and Paul Simonon, to form the Clash. The raw energetic spirit of the band’s debut single, “White Riot” (1977), set the tone for the albums The Clash (1977) and Give ’Em Enough Rope (1978), on which Strummer sang with an impassioned rasp. London Calling (1979) earned the Clash a reputation as masters of a stylistically diverse sound and was later named the best album of the 1980s by Rolling Stone magazine. Combat Rock (1982) featured the popular anthem “Rock the Casbah,” but it was the beginning of the end for the group, which disbanded in 1985.
Strummer produced a solo album, Earthquake Weather (1989), appeared in several movies, and contributed to film sound tracks, including those for Sid and Nancy (1986) and Grosse Pointe Blank (1997). In 1999 he formed a new band, Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros. That outfit recorded three albums, Rock Art and the X-Ray Style (1999), Global a Go-Go (2001), and Streetcore (2003), the last released by the band following Strummer’s death. The Clash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.
