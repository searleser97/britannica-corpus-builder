Buddy Holly and the Crickets made some of the most memorable records of the rock-and-roll era in Norman Petty’s off-the-beaten-track homemade studio in Clovis, New Mexico. Holly was probably the best all-around musician of the first generation of rockers—an inventive guitarist, songwriter, and singer—but he manifested these attributes only under Petty’s supervision. Petty, a cocktail lounge organist whose trio had had a couple of minor hits in 1954, was in many ways an improbable catalyst. Some 10 years before George Martin provided a similar context for the Beatles, Petty encouraged Holly and his drummer, Jerry Allison, to use the studio as a workshop, exploring unorthodox rhythms, instruments, and sounds on a series of 30 tracks recorded over a 12-month period (1957–58) that became a bedrock for future generations. Petty’s other successes included “Party Doll” by college boy Buddy Knox in 1957 and several hits by the Fireballs, including “Sugar Shack,” a chart topper in 1963.
