The Coasters,  American rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll vocal quartet, one of the most popular of the 1950s. The principal members were Carl Gardner (b. April 29, 1928, Tyler, Texas, U.S.—d. June 12, 2011, Port St. Lucie, Fla.), Bobby Nunn (b. June 25, 1925, Birmingham, Ala.—d. Nov. 5, 1986, Los Angeles, Calif.), Billy Guy (b. June 20, 1936, Itasca, Texas—d. Nov. 12, 2002, Las Vegas, Nev.), Leon Hughes (b. 1938), Will (“Dub”) Jones (b. May 14, 1928, Shreveport, La.—d. Jan. 16, 2000, Long Beach, Calif.), Cornelius Gunter (b. Nov. 14, 1938, Los Angeles—d. Feb. 26, 1990, Las Vegas), Ronnie Bright (b. Oct. 18, 1938), and Earl (“Speedo”) Carroll (b. Nov. 2, 1937, New York, N.Y.).
Originally from Los Angeles, the Coasters began as the Robins; instead of singing the usual ballads and rhythm pieces, they sang novelty songs by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller (“Riot in Cell Block No. 9” and “Smokey Joe’s Cafe”). In 1955, with a change in personnel (most notably the loss of Richard Berry, who would later write the rock classic “Louie, Louie”), they became the Coasters. The group had a series of rock-and-roll hits—largely for Atlantic Records’ subsidiary label Atco—with witty Leiber-Stoller songs directed at teenage listeners: “Searchin’ ” and “Young Blood” (both 1957), “Yakety Yak” (1958), and “Charlie Brown” and “Poison Ivy” (both 1959). The Coasters alternated lead singers and featured clever arrangements, including amusing bass replies and tenor saxophone solos by King Curtis, who played a crucial role in creating Atlantic’s rhythm-and-blues sound. With further personnel changes they continued performing in “oldies” shows into the 1990s. The Coasters were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.
