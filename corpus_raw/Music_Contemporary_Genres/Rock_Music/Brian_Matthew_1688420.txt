From rock and roll’s arrival in the 1950s to the heyday of the beat boom in the 1960s, British pop music fans were poorly served by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Before the advent of the BBC’s pop network, Radio 1, coverage of pop music was all but confined to two weekend morning shows on the Light Programme network: Saturday Club and Sunday’s Easy Beat. Both were presided over by Brian Matthew with the avuncular benevolence of an affable schoolteacher overseeing a lunchtime record hop. Hamstrung by  “needle time” agreements that restricted the number of records the BBC could play, Matthew was hardly a disc jockey, given that most of the music he introduced consisted of live cover versions of the records the listeners would have preferred to hear.
He also embraced each touted alternative to rock and roll, most notably skiffle—Saturday Club was originally called Saturday Skiffle Club—and the “trad jazz” (ersatz traditional New Orleans jazz) revival of the late 1950s, with an enthusiasm that aligned him with an older generation of listeners. Matthew had indeed been broadcasting since the 1940s, and, though he was already approaching middle age when, as host of Thank Your Lucky Stars, he brought the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to national television screens in 1963, he remained the voice of 1960s pop for listeners of Radio 2’s Sound of the Sixties through the late 1990s.
