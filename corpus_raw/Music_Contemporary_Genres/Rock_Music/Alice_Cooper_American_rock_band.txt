Alice Cooper,  American hard rock band that shared its name with its leader. In addition to producing a string of hits in the 1970s, Alice Cooper was among the first rock groups to infuse their performances with theatrics. The members were Alice Cooper (original name Vincent Furnier; b. Feb. 4, 1948, Detroit, Mich., U.S.), Michael Bruce (b. March 16, 1948), Glen Buxton (b. Nov. 10, 1947, Akron, Ohio—d. Oct. 19, 1997, Mason City, Iowa), Dennis Dunaway (b. Dec. 9, 1946, Cottage Grove, Ore.), and Neal Smith (b. Sept. 23, 1947, Akron).
The son of a preacher, Furnier formed a band with four schoolmates in Phoenix, Arizona. After moving to California in 1968, he and the band took the name Alice Cooper. Their hyperamplified club shows, influenced by British glam rock, earned them recognition as “the worst band in Los Angeles” and a contract with Frank Zappa’s Straight Records, for which they released two unsuccessful albums before relocating to Detroit. With producer Bob Ezrin (who later worked with Kiss, a band much influenced by Alice Cooper’s music and presentation, as were the New York Dolls), they crafted a clear, powerful, guitar-heavy sound on such youth anthems as “I’m Eighteen” and “School’s Out.” Makeup-wearing vocalist Cooper, whose identity soon eclipsed the band’s, formed a new group in 1974, adding Welcome to My Nightmare (1975) to a list of significant albums that included Killer (1971) and Billion Dollar Babies (1973), all explorations of decadence, perversion, and psychosis. Best remembered for its shocking stage show, Alice Cooper blended the gore and grotesquerie of horror films with the camp of 1930s Berlin cabaret. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.
