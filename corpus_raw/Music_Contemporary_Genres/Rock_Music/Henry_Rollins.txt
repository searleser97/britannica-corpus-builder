Henry Rollins, original name Henry Garfield,  (born February 13, 1961, Washington, D.C., U.S.), American singer, poet, monologuist, and publisher whose tenure as the lead vocalist of Los Angeles hardcore group Black Flag made him one of the most recognizable faces in the 1980s punk scene.
Rollins was an avid fan of hardcore music, and, as a teenager, he performed with a number of bands in the Washington, D.C., area. During a performance by Black Flag in New York City, Rollins, who was in the audience, climbed onstage and sang along with the group. Dez Cadena, then Black Flag’s front man, had been considering a move from vocals to guitar, and Rollins joined the band and took over as lead singer. The band encountered legal trouble with its label, MCA, but it nevertheless maintained a relentless touring schedule and produced a number of notable albums throughout the 1980s, including Damaged (1981) and In My Head (1985).
When Black Flag disbanded in 1986, Rollins continued performing, recruiting a revolving stable of musicians to join him in the Rollins Band. The Rollins Band recorded a string of solid hard-rock albums through the 1990s and early 2000s, and Weight (1994) featured Rollins’s first Top 40 single, “Liar.” However, Rollins was perhaps best known for his nonmusical endeavours. While still a member of Black Flag, he had established 2.13.61, a publishing house that released books of his own poetry as well as works by Nick Cave, Hubert Selby, Jr., and others.
Rollins also proved himself to be a gifted monologuist, and his performances often blended self-deprecating humour and political commentary with the rage and intensity befitting a former punk front man. Rollins earned a Grammy Award for best spoken-word album for Get in the Van: On the Road with Black Flag (1994). His popular Harmony in My Head radio show, which debuted in 2004, served as an outlet for his eclectic taste in music, and The Henry Rollins Show (2006–07) was a unique twist on the traditional television talk show. From 2015 he issued Henry & Heidi, a series of autobiographical podcasts that included his longtime assistant, Heidi May.
In addition, Rollins worked as an actor, with parts in films such as Heat (1995) and Lost Highway (1997) and recurring roles in the television series Sons of Anarchy (2009), The Legend of Korra (2014), Con Man (2015–17), and Z Nation (2017). He also hosted (2013–14) the history series 10 Things You Don’t Know About.
