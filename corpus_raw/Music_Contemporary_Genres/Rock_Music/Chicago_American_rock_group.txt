Chicago,  rock band, among the most popular American recording artists of all time, with sales of more than 100 million records. Initially a jazz-rock unit, Chicago thrived as it moved toward a lighter, ballad-oriented rock style. Its original members were Terry Kath (b. Jan. 31, 1946, Chicago, Ill., U.S.— d. Jan. 23, 1978, Los Angeles, Calif.), Peter Cetera (b. Sept. 13, 1944, Chicago), Robert Lamm (b. Oct. 13, 1944, New York, N.Y.), Walter Parazaider (b. March 14, 1945, Chicago), Danny Seraphine (b. Aug. 28, 1948, Chicago), James Pankow (b. Aug. 20, 1947, Chicago), and Lee Loughnane (b. Oct. 21, 1946, Chicago).
Called the Chicago Transit Authority before shortening its name to that of the city in which it was founded in 1967, Chicago distinguished itself from other rock bands of the late 1960s by the inclusion of horns in its lineup. The band’s early albums, including its debut, Chicago Transit Authority (1969)—made after the group relocated to Los Angeles—were resonant with soul-inflected jazz influences. By the early 1970s principal songwriters Cetera, Lamm, and Pankow and producer-manager James Guercio began to steer Chicago in a more pop-oriented direction. A series of hit albums over the next decade featured Top Ten songs such as “Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?” and “Saturday in the Park.” In the late 1970s, following the death of guitarist Kath, Chicago slumped; the band topped the charts again in the ’80s with hits such as “Hard to Say I’m Sorry,” though it failed to maintain that momentum in the ’90s. Vocalist Cetera also experienced some success as a soloist.
