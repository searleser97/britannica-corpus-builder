Carly Simon,  (born June 25, 1945, Bronx, New York, U.S.), American singer-songwriter and children’s book writer known for her pop songs. She had a number of hits in the 1970s, including “You’re So Vain” and “Anticipation.”
Simon was raised in an upper-class musical home. Her father was a cofounder of the Simon & Schuster publishing house and a pianist, and her mother was a singer and civil rights activist. Simon and her two sisters all pursued music; her brother became a photographer. Simon quit Sarah Lawrence College to perform with her sister Lucy as the Simon Sisters. In 1966, guided by Bob Dylan’s manager, Albert Grossman, and accompanied by members of the Band, she began a later-aborted solo album.
Several years later, with songs mostly cowritten by film critic and screenwriter Jacob Brackman, Simon had a series of hit albums and singles—primarily romantic ballads sung in her plaintive alto—that included “That’s the Way I’ve Always Heard It Should Be” (1971) and “Anticipation” (1971). The album titled Anticipation earned her a Grammy in 1971 for best new artist. “You’re So Vain,” like the album No Secrets, reached number one on the Billboard chart in 1973. She eventually revealed the subject of the song to be actor Warren Beatty. She had a major hit with her album Hotcakes (1974), which included “Haven’t Got Time for the Pain” as well as “Mockingbird” (1974), a duet with fellow singer-songwriter James Taylor, to whom she was married from 1972 to 1983. In 1977 she released “Nobody Does It Better,” the theme song to the James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me.
Simon’s career dipped in the early 1980s. She took a break from releasing original work and turned to recording covers of pop standards (Torch, 1981). She returned to prominence by composing music for films; she had a hit with her song “Coming Around Again” (the theme to the 1986 movie Heartburn), and she won a Grammy (for best song written specifically for a motion picture or television; 1990), a Golden Globe Award (1989), and an Academy Award for “Let the River Run,” which she also sang, in Working Girl (1988). She also scored music for the films Postcards from the Edge (1990) and This Is My Life (1992).
Simon was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1994. She also authored several children’s books, and in 2015 she published her memoir Boys in the Trees (a reference to her 1978 album of the same name), which focused on her romantic relationships and ended with the lengthiest section devoted to her tumultuous marriage to Taylor. In Touched by the Sun (2019) Simon chronicled her friendship with Jackie Kennedy Onassis.
