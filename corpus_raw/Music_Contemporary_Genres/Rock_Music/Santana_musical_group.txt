Santana,  American musical group whose use of salsa and mambo-style percussion exposed a wide rock audience to traditional Latin American music. The primary early members were Carlos Santana (b. July 20, 1947, Autlán de Navarro, Mexico), Gregg Rolie (b. June 17, 1947, Seattle, Washington, U.S.), David Brown (b. February 15, 1947, New York, U.S.—d. September 4, 2000), Mike Carabello (b. November 18, 1947, San Francisco, California, U.S.), José (“Chepito”) Areas (b. July 25, 1946, León, Nicaragua), and Mike Shrieve (b. July 6, 1949, San Francisco).
Santana was formed in 1966 in San Francisco and leaped to prominence after its appearance at Woodstock in 1969. The same year, the group’s debut album reached the top 10 of the Billboard album chart, and leader Carlos Santana joined the top echelon of rock guitarists. Santana’s second album, Abraxas (1970), went to number one while spawning the hit singles “Black Magic Woman” and “Oye Como Va,” and Santana III (1971), featuring new guitarist Neal Schon, followed. With Caravanserai (1972) the group shifted toward jazz. Musicians began leaving the band—most notably Rolie and Schon, who formed Journey. Influenced in part by the philosophy of Sri Chinmoy, Carlos Santana continued excursions into jazz-rock with various musicians for several years before returning, on Amigos (1976), to the formula that brought his initial success. Moonflower, a best-selling double album that included a hit remake of the Zombies’ “She’s Not There,” followed in 1977.
Santana continued the pattern of alternating rock radio-friendly releases with jazz projects through the 1990s. In 1998 the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the following year Carlos Santana achieved the greatest commercial and critical success of his career with Supernatural, which included collaborations with such performers as Eric Clapton, Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, and Rob Thomas of the band Matchbox 20. The album topped charts worldwide, selling more than 20 million copies, and received a record-tying eight Grammy Awards. Later albums for the band included Shaman (2002), another star-studded affair; the mostly instrumental Shape Shifter (2012); Santana IV (2016), recorded with almost all the original band members; Power of Peace (2017), a collaboration with the Isley Brothers; and the acclaimed Africa Speaks (2019), which featured the vocals of flamenco-fusion artist Buika and was produced by Rick Rubin.
