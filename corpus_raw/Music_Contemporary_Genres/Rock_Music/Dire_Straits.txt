Dire Straits,  British rock band whose supple, slightly blues-tinged guitar rock was popular in the late 1970s and the ’80s. The original members were Mark Knopfler (b. August 12, 1949, Glasgow, Scotland), David Knopfler (b. December 27, 1952, Glasgow), John Illsley (b. June 24, 1949, Leicester, Leicestershire, England), and Pick Withers (b. April 4, 1948). Later members included Hal Lindes (b. June 30, 1953, Monterey, California, U.S.) and Alan Clark (b. March 5, 1952, Durham, Durham, England).
Formed in London in 1977, Dire Straits were led by Mark Knopfler, a onetime journalist and college teacher who polished his musicianship as part of the pub rock movement. Their eponymous debut album (1978), featuring the hit “Sultans of Swing,” established the group’s commercial appeal on both sides of the Atlantic. Communiqué (1979), Making Movies (1980), often held to be their finest album, and Love over Gold (1982) continued Dire Straits’ run of commercially successful albums, the last spawning the minor hit “Industrial Disease.” They became superstars with the multimillion-selling Brothers in Arms (1985), which produced several hit singles—including the chart-topping “Money for Nothing,” a pointed send-up of rock in the age of music videos. The group disbanded in 1988 but re-formed to release On Every Street (1991). Mark Knopfler, Dire Straits’ singer and main songwriter and a gifted and influential guitarist, also wrote film scores and participated in numerous side projects. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.
