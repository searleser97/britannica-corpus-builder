Roxy Music,  British art rock band of the 1970s whose influential style was an amalgam of glam rock campiness, sophisticated, often experimental musicianship, arch humour, and world-weary romanticism. The principal members were vocalist-songwriter Bryan Ferry (b. September 26, 1945, Washington, Durham, England), keyboardist Brian Eno (in full Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno; b. May 15, 1948, Woodbridge, Suffolk), saxophonist Andy Mackay (b. July 23, 1946, England), guitarist Phil Manzanera (original name Philip Targett-Adams; b. January 31, 1951, London), drummer  Paul Thompson (b. May 13, 1951, Jarrow, Northumberland), and keyboardist  Eddie Jobson (b. April 28, 1955, Billingham, Durham).
Formed in 1971, Roxy Music was largely the brainchild of Ferry, who had studied with Richard Hamilton, a key figure in British pop art. A shifting early lineup stabilized around Ferry, Mackay, Eno, Manzanera, and Thompson. The band’s eponymous debut album, the nonalbum single “Virginia Plain” (both 1972), and the follow-up album For Your Pleasure (1973) were hits in Britain, as Roxy Music’s fully textured sound and lush instrumentation set it apart from mainstream rock. When Eno departed to pursue his remarkable career as a solo performer and producer, Ferry became even more the band’s focal point, cultivating a suave persona he projected in a solo career that paralleled his work with Roxy Music. Following British success with Stranded (1973) and Country Life (1974), the band broke through in the United States with Siren and its hit single “Love Is the Drug” in 1975. Splitting, re-forming, and splitting again, Roxy Music had commercial success with its albums in the late 1970s and early 1980s, most notably with its final studio album, Avalon (1982), but failed to regain its earlier critical acclaim. After a lengthy hiatus, the band reunited in 2001 and continued to perform occasionally for the next 10 years before dissolving for a second time. Roxy Music was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.
