The Flamingos,  American doo-wop vocal group of the 1950s noted for their tight, pristine harmonies. The principal members were Zeke Carey (b. January 24, 1933, Bluefield, Virginia, U.S.—d. December 24, 1999,  Bethesda, Maryland), Jake Carey (b. September 9, 1926, Pulaski, Virginia—d. December 10, 1997, Lanham, Maryland), Paul Wilson (b. January 6, 1935, Chicago, Illinois—d. May 6, 1988, Chicago), Johnny Carter (b. June 2, 1934, Chicago—d. August 21, 2009, Harvey, Illinois), Sollie McElroy (b. July 16, 1933, Gulfport, Mississippi—d. January 14, 1994, Chicago), and Nate Nelson (b. April 10, 1932, Chicago—d. June 1, 1984, Boston, Massachusetts). Later members included Tommy Hunt (b. June 18, 1933, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) and Terry Johnson (b. November 12, 1935, Baltimore, Maryland).
The Flamingos were formed in Chicago in 1951. Cousins Zeke and Jake Carey sang tenor and bass, respectively; Carter also sang tenor; and Wilson was the group’s baritone. Most prominent among a succession of lead singers were McElroy (1951–54) and Nelson (1954–60). The group had regional success with a number of rhythm-and-blues records before achieving national fame in 1956 with the ballad “I’ll Be Home.” They went on to help pioneer rock and roll with appearances in several Alan Freed-sponsored stage shows and in the films Rock, Rock, Rock (1956) and Go Johnny Go (1958). After moving to New York City in 1957, the Flamingos lost Carter but added vocalist-keyboardist Hunt and guitarist Johnson. Working with producer George Goldner, they registered their biggest hits: “Lovers Never Say Goodbye” (1958), “I Only Have Eyes for You” (1959), and “Nobody Loves Me Like You” (1960). In the early 1960s, with the Careys the only remaining original members, the group achieved a few soul-style hits, but by the early 1970s they had become a revival act. The Flamingos were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.
