For a long time, London pop was cynical, inept, or ironic. In the early 1970s a new generation of producers—heedful of Phil Spector’s description of his work as “little symphonies for the kids”—injected a new sense of market-driven buoyancy into the pop single. Mickie Most was a North Londoner, but he learned the business in the 1950s in South Africa. He spent the 1960s producing acts such as Herman’s Hermits, Donovan, and the Animals but really came into his own in the 1970s, with a run of brisk, optimistic hits for his own RAK label, recorded at his studio in the Inner London suburb of St. John’s Wood. Together with songwriting producers Nicky Chinn (from Bristol) and Mike Chapman (from Australia), Most worked in a variety of styles: Suzi Quatro’s innocent take on stadium rock (“Can the Can”), Mud’s winking nods to the 1950s (“Lonely This Christmas”), and Hot Chocolate’s populist rhythm and blues (“You Sexy Thing”). What his productions had in common was an unwavering sense of irony-free confidence.
Chinn and Chapman also worked at Utopia Studios, where they perfected the raucous teen beat of the Sweet with coproducer Phil Wainman before Chapman moved to New York City to produce most of Blondie’s biggest hits. Elsewhere in central London, Mike Leander put together the infectious dance pop of Gary Glitter’s “Rock and Roll, Part Two,” and Tony Visconti produced Marc Bolan (of T. Rex) and David Bowie (in his Ziggy Stardust phase) at Trident Studios in Soho.
