Jule Styne, original name Julius Kerwin Stein,  (born Dec. 31, 1905, London, Eng.—died  Sept. 20, 1994, New York, N.Y., U.S.), American songwriter.
The son of Ukrainian Jewish parents, Stein immigrated with them to the United States in 1912. The family settled in Chicago, and Stein, having displayed musical talent from an early age, studied the piano. He began playing piano in nightclubs and with traveling orchestras, and his first hit song was published in 1926. In the early 1930s he changed his name to Jule Styne to avoid confusion with another musical personality named Jules Stein. He moved to New York City in 1934 and in 1937 to Hollywood, where he wrote scores for film musicals. Styne collaborated with the lyricist Sammy Cahn to write popular ballads for Frank Sinatra in the early 1940s, and the two men wrote the film musical Anchors Aweigh (1945) and the Broadway stage musical High Button Shoes (1947). Styne’s next Broadway success was Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1949; filmed 1953), with lyricist Leo Robin. He contributed six songs to a Broadway revival of Peter Pan (1954). Styne collaborated with Adolf Green and Betty Comden on the musical Bells Are Ringing (1956; filmed 1960) and with lyricist Stephen Sondheim on Gypsy (1959; filmed 1962). His last major success on Broadway was Funny Girl (1964; filmed 1968), written with lyricist Robert Merrill. Sugar (1972) enjoyed a modest success.
Styne’s theatrical music was well suited to the talents of such leading ladies as Carol Channing, Mary Martin, Judy Holliday, Ethel Merman, and Barbra Streisand. He wrote or cowrote more than 1,500 songs.
