Coxsone Dodd, who had encountered rhythm and blues as a migrant cane cutter in the southern United States and returned home to become one of Jamaica’s first sound-system (mobile disco) operators, founded Studio One in 1963. His crude and tiny one-track studio and pressing plant produced hits for the vocal group that later became Toots and the Maytals and employed the talents of the young Bob Marley as writer, performer, and artists-and-repertoire man. In the early ska years the Studio One house band recorded under various individual and collective guises, most successfully as the Skatalites with “Guns of Navarone” (1964). It was the Rastafarian-influenced rhythm created by drummer Leroy (“Horsemouth”) Wallace on 1969’s “Things a Come Up to Bump,” however, that pointed the label toward its peak in the 1970s, when it established reggae’s distinctive granite-and-custard sound with productions that pushed the lurching rhythm to the front while leaving the lead vocal piping out from somewhere deep in the mix.
By this point, blessed with an eight-track recorder and an Echo-phlanger—which created phasing and echo—Studio One was nicknamed “the Academy” and became a prime source of  “roots rockers”—quasi-religious, bottom-heavy, hip-grinding records by the likes of the Abyssinians, Burning Spear, Dennis Brown, and the Heptones. Studio One’s influence is easily tracked: the Clash’s cover of Willie Williams’s “Armagideon Time” helped to establish reggae as a minority taste with white fans in the United States; the Papa Michigan and General Smiley duets of the late 1970s, among the label’s last great moments, are clear precursors of later trends in American hip-hop; and echoes of Studio One’s distinctive rumbling sound can be clearly heard in the British group Massive Attack and all who followed in their wake.
