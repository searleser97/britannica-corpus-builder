The Buggles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star,” the first music video broadcast on MTV (Music TeleVision) when it debuted in the summer of 1981, only slightly overstated the impact that the cable television network would have on music and popular culture. Presenting round-the-clock music videos punctuated with “music news” and hosted by upbeat “veejays,” the New York City-based MTV was accused of everything from shortening viewers’ attention spans to sexism and racism. Nonetheless, its rapid pace and the increasingly sophisticated techniques employed in the music videos it broadcast had a noticeable effect on motion pictures, commercials, and television. It also changed the music industry; looking good (or at least interesting) on MTV became as important as sounding good when it came to selling recordings.
Artists such as Madonna and Michael Jackson became superstars through their exploitation of the medium. Jackson’s videos for Thriller (1982) were dance-oriented minimusicals that not only helped make the album a multimillion seller but broadened MTV programming to include black artists. In time MTV played a pivotal role in selling hip-hop to a predominantly white suburban audience. The network’s programming also diversified to include youth-oriented game shows, animation, comedies, and off-the-wall documentaries. A sister network, VH1, was created in 1985 to serve a slightly older audience, and by the 1990s MTV had affiliates around the world.
