Berthold Kaempfert,  (born October 16, 1923, Hamburg, Germany—died June 22, 1980, Majorca, Spain), West German composer who achieved international success with the love song “Strangers in the Night,” made popular by Frank Sinatra.
Kaempfert was trained at the Hamburg Music Academy and served with a naval band during World War II. Captured in 1945, he formed a prisoner-of-war band, and after his release he embarked on a career as bandleader and arranger and composer of popular melodies. His band’s undemanding sound provided easy listening on the British Forces’ radio network and in American army clubs, but it was not until he recorded “Wonderland by Night” in 1961 that he gained his first major success. That was followed by “Spanish Eyes” and “Strangers in the Night,” which sold more than 10 million copies; Kaempfert’s other hits included “African Night,” “Swinging Safari,” and “Blue Midnight.” Kaempfert later settled (1966) in Switzerland.
