Gordon McLendon, the Texas broadcaster who is credited (along with Todd Storz and Bill Stewart) with the creation of Top 40 radio, owned KLIF in Dallas, Texas. In 1953 he switched from live music and magazine-style programming to records and disc jockeys. By then an in-house musical ensemble had been producing station jingles—an idea that quickly spread throughout radio—and McLendon added wild contests and promotions, along with an emphasis on local news, to the mix. At its peak KLIF drew some 40 percent of Dallas’s listeners. Many of them tuned in to the nighttime shenanigans of Russ (“Weird Beard”) Knight. Holder of a master’s degree in journalism and the self-proclaimed “savior of Dallas radio,” Knight had a larger-than-life personality, a way with rhymes, and a penchant for the sound effects of the day (horns, whistles, and echo machines).
