The Crystals,  American girl group formed in 1960, whose original members were Barbara Alston (b. December 29, 1943, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.—d. February 16, 2018, Charlotte, North Carolina), Myrna Giraud (b. 1943, Brooklyn, New York), Delores (“Dee Dee”) Kenniebrew (b. 1945, Brooklyn), Mary Thomas (b. 1946, Brooklyn), and Pattie Wright (b. 1945, Brooklyn). Giraud was replaced in 1962 by Dolores ("La La") Brooks (b. 1946, Brooklyn).
The group was created by Alston’s uncle, Benny Wells, when he recruited the singers to record a series of pop singles. Wells enlisted the aid of a series of songwriters, a quest that led him to the Manhattan headquarters of publishers Hill and Range. It was there, while rehearsing the single “There’s No Other (Like My Baby),” that the group met producer Phil Spector. In the recording studio, Spector gave the song a rhythm-and-blues feel and added the layered instrumentation that would later characterize his “wall of sound” production style. Released on Spector’s Philles label in late 1961, “There’s No Other (Like My Baby)” reached the Billboard Top 20. The group followed with “Uptown,” a modest hit that allowed Spector to experiment with nontraditional pop instruments such as castinets and Spanish guitars.
In 1962 the single “He’s a Rebel” reached number one on the pop charts, and, although the song was credited to the Crystals, Spector brought in singer Darlene Love of the Blossoms to record the lead vocals. The following year, with La La Brooks as their lead vocalist, the Crystals reclaimed their name with the smash singles “Da Doo Ron Ron” and “Then He Kissed Me.” The latter song represented one of the finest achievements of Spector’s wall of sound technique, and it was the band’s biggest international hit. Later releases did not reach that level of success, however, and the group disbanded in 1967.
