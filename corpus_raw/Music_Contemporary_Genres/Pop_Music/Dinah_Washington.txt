Dinah Washington, original name Ruth Lee Jones,  (born August 29, 1924, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, U.S.—died  December 14, 1963, Detroit, Michigan), American jazz and blues singer noted for her excellent voice control and unique gospel-influenced delivery.
As a child, Ruth Jones moved with her family to Chicago. She sang in and played the piano for her church choir and in 1939 began to sing and play piano in various Chicago nightclubs, in addition to touring with Sallie Martin’s gospel group. About 1942–43 she adopted the stage name Dinah Washington. From 1943 to 1946 she sang with the Lionel Hampton band and in 1946 began a successful solo career. During the period from 1949 to 1955, her recordings were consistently among the top 10 hits of the rhythm-and-blues charts. Her first hit song was “Evil Gal Blues,” and it was followed by such others as “Am I Asking Too Much” and “Baby Get Lost.” She later crossed over to the popular (pop) music market, in which she had her greatest commercial success, notably with “What a Diff’rence a Day Makes.” Washington continued performing at jazz festivals, however, and she retained many of her earlier fans because of her passionate supple style.
