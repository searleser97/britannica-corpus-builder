Teresa Teng, Chinese (Wade-Giles romanization) Teng Li-Chün or (Pinyin) Deng Lijun,  (born January 29, 1953, Yün-lin county, Taiwan—died May 8, 1995, Chiang Mai, Thailand), Taiwanese singer who was a superstar throughout East Asia and was especially admired in Taiwan and China. Her clear, sweet voice and her heartrending love songs were immensely popular in the 1970s and ’80s.
Teng’s parents were born in China. Her father was an officer in the Nationalist army, and the family moved to Taiwan in 1949. While an elementary school student, Teng won a singing contest, and in her teens she began performing in public. She appeared frequently on television in the late 1960s and early ’70s, which helped her gain wide recognition. Teng began appearing in films and recording albums, and she quickly achieved stardom.
Although Teng never performed in China, pirated recordings of her songs could be found even in remote villages. Her popularity was so great that it was said to rival that of Deng Xiaoping, then China’s paramount leader, with whom she shared a surname. A popular saying was that Old Deng ruled the day and Little Teng the night. In 1973 she began focusing on performing in Japan, where she also quickly became popular. Her transnational success was attributed in part to her multilingualism (she sang in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, and English), and she won legions of fans in such far-flung locations as Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.
Some of Teng’s most popular albums included Dandan youqing (“Faded Feelings”; 1983), which set classical poems to music; I’m in Your Debt (1984); and The Unforgettable Teresa Teng (1992). Her best-known song was “The Moon Represents My Heart,” from Love in Hong Kong (1977). Her other top songs included “Goodbye My Love” (1974), “Tian Mi Mi” (1979), “May We Be Together Forever” (1983), and “I Only Care About You,” which she released in Japanese (1986) and in Mandarin (1987).
Teng retired from music in the early 1990s and took up residence in France. She was vacationing in Thailand when she suffered a fatal asthma attack.
