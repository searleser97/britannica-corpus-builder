Anita Baker,  (born January 26, 1958, Toledo, Ohio, U.S.), American singer whose three-octave range and powerful, emotional delivery brought her international acclaim in the 1980s and ’90s. She was one of the most popular artists in urban contemporary music, a genre that her sophisticated, tradition-oriented soul and rhythm-and-blues singing helped to define.
Baker’s talent first became apparent when she sang in church choirs in Detroit, where she grew up. Against her family’s wishes, she dropped out of community college to pursue a singing career, performing in nightclubs with local bands and joining the funk group Chapter 8, with whom she toured for several years and recorded an album that included the hit “I Just Want to Be Your Girl.” Discouraged when the band was dropped by its record company, Baker ceased performing. Lured back into the business by Beverly Glen Records, she recorded The Songstress (1983), a solo album that sold more than 300,000 copies and spent more than a year on the charts. Moving to Elektra, she served as executive producer of her next album, Rapture (1986), which won two Grammy Awards, sold more than five million copies, and spawned two hit singles—“Sweet Love” and “You Bring Me Joy.” The album Giving You the Best That I’ve Got and a three-month tour with Luther Vandross followed in 1988, and Compositions was released in 1990; both albums won Grammys. Personal issues led Baker to take a four-year hiatus, but in 1994 she returned with the album Rhythm of Love. In 1996 she signed with Atlantic Records.
Another hiatus followed, but Baker resumed performing in 2002, and two years later My Everything appeared on the Blue Note label. After releasing a holiday album (2005), she focused on performing. In 2012 Baker recorded a single, “Lately,” for which she received a Grammy nomination, but no album followed, and in 2018 she embarked on what she described as her farewell tour.
