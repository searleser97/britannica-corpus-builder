Liberace, original name Wladziu Valentino Liberace,  (born May 16, 1919, West Allis, Wisconsin, U.S.—died February 4, 1987, Palm Springs, California), American pianist. Born to Polish and Italian immigrants, he appeared as a soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at age 16. He began giving concerts in flamboyant costumes with ornate pianos and candelabra, and though he occasionally performed with symphony orchestras, he built his career playing primarily popular music. Hugely successful, he hosted his own television variety series, The Liberace Show (1952–55, 1969), and appeared in films such as Sincerely Yours (1955). In later years he performed frequently in Las Vegas, Nevada.
