Solomon Burke,  (born March 21, 1940, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died October 10, 2010, Haarlemmermeer, Netherlands), American singer whose success in the early 1960s in merging the gospel style of the African American churches with rhythm and blues helped to usher in the soul music era.
Born into a family that established its own church, Burke was both a preacher and the host of a gospel radio program by age 12. He began recording in 1955 but did not have his first national hit until 1961, with a rhythm-and-blues version of a country ballad, “Just out of Reach.” His recordings, most of which were produced in New York City, incorporated gospel-derived vocal techniques—shouted interjections, an exhortatory recitation, melisma, and rasping timbre. At Atlantic Records, under producer Bert Berns, Burke became one of the first rhythm-and-blues performers to be called a soul artist, based on his success with “Cry to Me” (1962), “If You Need Me” (1963), “Goodbye Baby (Baby Goodbye)” (1964), “Got to Get You off My Mind” (1965), and his last Top 40 pop hit, “Tonight’s the Night” (1965).
After the mid-1960s Burke continued to record but with lessening success, last placing a record on the rhythm-and-blues chart in 1978. He remained a popular performer on the blues festival and club circuit into the early 21st century, even enjoying a resurgence of critical attention in the 2000s. His 2002 album Don’t Give Up on Me won the Grammy Award for best contemporary blues album, and three of his subsequent releases—Make Do with What You Got (2005), Like a Fire (2008), and Nothing’s Impossible (2010)—were nominated in that category. He was traveling to the Netherlands for a performance in October 2010 when he died at Schiphol airport near Amsterdam. Burke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.
