Red Hot Chili Peppers,  American rock band that combined funk and punk rock to create a new musical style in the 1980s. The original members were vocalist Anthony Kiedis (b. November 1, 1962, Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.), bassist Flea (original name Michael Balzary; b. October 16, 1962, Melbourne, Australia), guitarist Hillel Slovak (b. April 13, 1962, Haifa, Israel—d. June 25, 1988, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), and drummer Jack Irons (b. July 18, 1962, Los Angeles). Later members included guitar player and singer John Frusciante (b. March 5, 1970, Queens, New York, U.S.) and drummer Chad Smith (b. October 25, 1962, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.).
Heavily influenced by the Los Angeles punk music scene in the late 1970s, school friends Kiedis, Flea, Slovak, and Irons formed Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The group performed along the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles during the early 1980s, wearing only strategically placed tube socks, which, as a stage gimmick, became their trademark. By 1983, under the name Red Hot Chili Peppers, they had a loyal underground following and a recording contract with EMI. Their first album to reach the Billboard 200 charts was The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Just as the band was beginning to enjoy commercial success, Slovak died of a heroin overdose and Irons left the band, leaving Kiedis and Flea to re-form with Frusciante and Smith. Their 1989 album, Mother’s Milk, became a surprise hit. The album went gold by early 1990 and was followed by the more successful Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which included the band’s first top ten single, “Under the Bridge,” as well as the Grammy Award-winning “Give It Away.”
Through a number of lineup changes, the Red Hot Chili Peppers continued to release well-received albums, including Californication (1999), By the Way (2002), and Grammy-winning Stadium Arcadium (2006). The band went on hiatus in early 2008, and the following year Frusciante announced that he had left the group to pursue a solo career. He was replaced on lead guitar by Josh Klinghoffer, who had previously played with the group on the Stadium Arcadium tour. Putting aside various side projects, the band returned to the studio and released I’m with You in 2011. The band exchanged longtime producer Rick Rubin for Danger Mouse (Brian Burton) for its 11th studio album, The Getaway (2016). In 2012 the Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
