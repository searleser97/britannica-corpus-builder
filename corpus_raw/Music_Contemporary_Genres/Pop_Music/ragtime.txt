Ragtime,  propulsively syncopated musical style, one forerunner of jazz and the predominant style of American popular music from about 1899 to 1917. Ragtime evolved in the playing of honky-tonk pianists along the Mississippi and Missouri rivers in the last decades of the 19th century. It was influenced by minstrel-show songs, African American banjo styles, and syncopated (off-beat) dance rhythms of the cakewalk, and also elements of European music. Ragtime found its characteristic expression in formally structured piano compositions. The regularly accented left-hand beat, in 4/4 or 2/4 time, was opposed in the right hand by a fast, bouncingly syncopated melody that gave the music its powerful forward impetus.
Scott Joplin, called the “King of Ragtime,” published the most successful of the early rags, “The Maple Leaf Rag,” in 1899. Joplin, who considered ragtime a permanent and serious branch of classical music, composed hundreds of short pieces, a set of études, and operas in the style. Other important performers were, in St. Louis, Louis Chauvin and Thomas M. Turpin (father of St. Louis ragtime) and, in New Orleans, Tony Jackson.
Though ragtime’s heyday was relatively short-lived, the music influenced the later development of jazz. Ragtime experienced occasional revivals, most notably in the 1970s. During that decade pianist Joshua Rifkin released the acclaimed album Scott Joplin: Piano Rags (1970), and Marvin Hamlisch adapted Joplin’s music for the score of the hugely popular movie The Sting (1973). Hamlisch won an Academy Award for his work, and his version of Joplin’s “The Entertainer” earned a Grammy Award and was a hit song.
