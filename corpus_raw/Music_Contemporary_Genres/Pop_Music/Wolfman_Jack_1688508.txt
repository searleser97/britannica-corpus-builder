Possessed of one of the most distinctive voices and styles in radio, Wolfman Jack played rhythm and blues and partied wildly in the studios—or at least it sounded like he did. He told listeners that he was “nekkid” and urged them to disrobe as well. In a raspy voice that alternated from a purr to a roar, he sold his music, himself, and a myriad of patent medicines and oldies albums on powerful stations located in Mexico, just across the border from the United States. Armed with 250,000-watt signals, his nighttime shows on stations such as Ciudad Acuña’s XERF reached most of North America beginning in the early 1960s. After a series of legal and political problems forced him to do his show by tape, the Wolfman took charge of XERB in Tijuana in 1966, hiring a mix of favourite disc jockeys and medicine men to fill the time. For his own show, he set up shop in a studio in Los Angeles and shipped his tapes to Mexico, where they were broadcast, reaching back to Hollywood and far beyond.
Born Robert Weston Smith in 1938, he grew up in New York City and later became a country music deejay. It was as Wolfman Jack, however, that he became a cult figure and icon of rock-and-roll  radio. George Lucas typecast him as a mysterious deejay in his coming-of-age film American Graffiti (1973), and the Wolfman went on to host television’s Midnight Special—featuring popular rock, soul, folk, and country performers—and to achieve success in syndicated radio. He died on July 1, 1995.
