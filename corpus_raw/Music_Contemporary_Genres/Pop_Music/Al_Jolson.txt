Al Jolson, byname of Asa Yoelson,  (born May 26, 1886, Srednike, Russia [now Seredžius, Lithuania]—died October 23, 1950, San Francisco, California, U.S.), popular American singer and blackface comedian of the musical stage and motion pictures, from before World War I to 1940. His unique singing style and personal magnetism established an immediate rapport with audiences.
Taken to the United States when he was seven years old, Jolson was reared in Washington, D.C., where he made his first stage appearance in 1899. He performed with his brother and others in vaudeville before joining Lew Dockstader’s minstrel troupe in 1909. He became a popular New York entertainer and singer, being featured in the musicals La Belle Paree (1911), Honeymoon Express (1913), Bombo (1921), and Big Boy (1925). In Sinbad (1918) he transformed an unsuccessful George Gershwin song, “Swanee,” into his trademark number. And in Bombo he introduced “My Mammy.” The same show included three Jolson favourites: “Toot, Toot, Tootsie,” “California, Here I Come,” and “April Showers.” Some of his biggest successes were achieved at the New York Winter Garden.
In 1927 Jolson starred in The Jazz Singer, the first feature film with synchronized speech as well as music and sound effects. The picture revolutionized the motion-picture industry and marked the end of the silent-film era. Other films include The Singing Fool (1928), Say It with Songs (1929), Mammy (1930), Hallelujah, I’m a Bum (1933), Go into Your Dance (1935), and Swanee River (1940). The story of his life was filmed in The Jolson Story (1946) and a sequel, Jolson Sings Again (1949). He also collaborated in the writing of many song hits and was a very popular recording artist.
