Professor Longhair, byname of Roy Byrd, original name in full Henry Roeland Byrd,  (born December 19, 1918, Bogalusa, Louisiana, U.S.—died January 30, 1980, New Orleans), American singer and pianist who helped shape the sound of New Orleans rhythm and blues from the mid-1940s.
As a young boy living in New Orleans, Byrd learned the rudiments of music from his mother. He constructed his own instruments and played and danced in the streets for tips. But when he found an old discarded piano, Byrd patched it up and mastered it under the tutelage of such barrelhouse pianists as Sullivan Rock and Kid Stormy Weather.
His first and only hit song was “Bald Head,” recorded in 1950. While he enjoyed only limited popularity during his career, his signature piano style, characterized by a rollicking boogie-woogie bass and engaging syncopation, can be heard in the music of such influential figures as Fats Domino, Allen Toussaint—who called Professor Longhair the “Bach of Rock and Roll”—and Dr. John (Mac Rebennack). Still, Professor Longhair’s compositions “Tipitina,” “Go to the Mardi Gras,” “Big Chief,” and “Mardi Gras in New Orleans” became and have remained anthems on the Mississippi River delta during Mardi Gras.
It was not until the 1970s, some 30 years into his career, that Professor Longhair attained greater recognition. After producing the album Live on the Queen Mary (1978)  with Paul McCartney, Byrd and his professional band, the Blues Scholars, were a huge success on tours of Europe and the United States. Professor Longhair topped off his career with the critically acclaimed  Crawfish Fiesta (1980), and in 1992 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
