Kool & the Gang,  American funk and pop band from Jersey City, New Jersey, that was one of the first successful self-contained African American bands of the 1970s. The principal members were Khalis Bayyan (byname of Ronald Bell; b. November 1, 1951, Youngstown, Ohio, U.S.—d. September 9, 2020, U.S. Virgin Islands), Robert (“Kool”) Bell (b. October 8, 1950, Youngstown), Claydes Charles Smith (b. September 6, 1948, Jersey City, New Jersey—d. June 20, 2006, Maplewood, New Jersey), George (“Funky”) Brown (b. January 5, 1949, Jersey City), Dennis (“DT”) Thomas (b. February 9, 1951, Jersey City—d. August 7, 2021, New Jersey), Robert (“Spike”) Mickens (b. 1951, Jersey City—d. November 2, 2010, Far Rockaway, New York), Ricky West (original name Richard Westfield; b. Jersey City—d. 1985), and James (“JT”) Taylor (b. August 16, 1953,  Laurens, South Carolina).
The group’s first charting single, “Kool and the Gang,” a horn-driven, highly rhythmic instrumental dance track, was followed by a steady string of similar singles through 1976. The band’s commercial breakthrough came in 1973 with the album Wild and Peaceful, which featured the singles “Funky Stuff,” “Jungle Boogie,” and “Hollywood Swinging,” all of which reached the rhythm-and-blues Top Ten. Kool & the Gang’s sound was an innovative fusion of jazz, African rhythms, and street funk that established the band as an innovator until the onset of the disco era. However, when the group’s single “Open Sesame” was reissued on the soundtrack for the motion picture Saturday Night Fever in 1977, Kool & the Gang shifted emphasis toward pop and disco.
In 1979 the band added lead vocalist Taylor and producer Eumir Deodato, which led to a cleaner, pop-driven sound and to the crossover single “Ladies’ Night.” Numerous hits followed, including the number one hit “Celebration” in 1980, as well as the sentimental pop songs “Joanna” in 1983 and “Cherish” in 1985. Kool & the Gang charted more pop singles than any other act in the 1980s. The band continued to record and tour into the early 21st century. Later albums included State of Affairs (1995) and Still Kool (2007).
