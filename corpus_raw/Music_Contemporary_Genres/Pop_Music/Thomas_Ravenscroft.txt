Thomas Ravenscroft,  (born c. 1582?, Sussex?, Eng.—died c. 1633, London?), composer remembered for his social songs and his collection of psalm settings.
He took his bachelor of music degree at the University of Cambridge, possibly in 1605. From 1618 to 1622 he was music master at Christ’s Hospital. Ravenscroft’s Whole Booke of Psalmes (1621), comprising more than 100 metrical psalm tunes, proved extremely popular. He harmonized about half the melodies, commissioning or compiling the rest. Several of his versions are still in use.
His secular collections are full of interest for the historian of popular music. Pammelia (1609), containing 100 catches and rounds, was the first anthology of its kind; Deuteromelia (1609) has 31 items, including “Three blind mice”; Melismata (1611) has 23 songs for the “court, city, and country humours”; and his theoretical work, the Brief Discourse (1614), appends further characteristic pieces. Ravenscroft aimed to please a middle-class lay public very different from the educated elite who enjoyed the madrigal or the air, or ayre.
