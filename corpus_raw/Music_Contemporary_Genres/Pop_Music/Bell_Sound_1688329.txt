Al Weintraub opened Bell Sound in the early 1950s on West 87th Street, and when he moved closer to the midtown action (to 46th Street and 8th Avenue) in 1954, Bell became New York City’s busiest independent studio. Recording sessions in the city were closely monitored by the local chapter of the Musicians Union, which ensured that overtime was paid if a session ran a minute over the statutory three hours.  Most label owners who came to Bell used the same nucleus of musicians, who could be depended on to find a groove with a minimum of run-throughs:  Mickey (“Guitar”) Baker, Panama Francis on drums, and Sam Taylor on sax. Arranger Sammy Lowe was called in if strings were needed.  In addition to New York City-based customers such as Roulette and Al Silver’s Herald and Ember, out-of-town companies often used Bell Sound to catch artists in the middle of their busy touring schedules. Henry Glover produced many sessions there for King Records of Cincinnati, Ohio (Little Willie John, James Brown), and King’s engineer, Eddie Smith, joined Bell Sound in 1957.   Buddy Holly’s “Rave On” (1958) was recorded at Bell Sound, which continued to be the studio of choice into the 1960s, with Del Shannon’s “Runaway” (1961) a testament to the studio’s ability to capture atmosphere and excitement.
