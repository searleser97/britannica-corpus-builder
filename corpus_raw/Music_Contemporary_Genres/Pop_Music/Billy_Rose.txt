Billy Rose, original name William Samuel Rosenberg,  (born Sept. 6, 1899, Bronx, N.Y., U.S.—died Feb. 10, 1966, Montego Bay, Jam.), American theatrical impresario and composer of more than 50 song hits.
Rose became an expert at taking shorthand dictation and during World War I was the chief stenographer for the financier Bernard Baruch, head of the War Industries Board. In the 1920s he began to write songs and eventually composed about 400, including “Barney Google,” “That Old Gang of Mine,” “It’s Only a Paper Moon,” “Me and My Shadow,” and “Without a Song.” As a theatrical producer, Rose’s successes included Crazy Quilt (1931); Jumbo (1935), an extravagant circus musical; and Carmen Jones (1943), the musical comedy version of the opera Carmen, with an all-black cast. Rose owned several nightclubs, and his varied career also included astute real estate and stock market investments, art collecting, and highly publicized philanthropy. One of his several marriages was to Fanny Brice, the singing comedienne of the Ziegfeld Follies (1929, divorced 1938). He left a substantial legacy to theatre scholarship, endowing the Billy Rose Theatre Collection at the New York Public Library.
