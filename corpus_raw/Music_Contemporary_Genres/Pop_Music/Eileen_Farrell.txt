Eileen Farrell,  (born February 13, 1920, Willimantic, Connecticut, U.S.—died March 23, 2002, Park Ridge, New Jersey), American soprano who achieved success in both operatic and popular music.
Farrell’s parents were former vaudevillians. She traveled to New York City in 1939 to study singing and in 1940 earned a position with the studio choral and ensemble groups on the CBS radio network. The next year she began her own program, Eileen Farrell Sings, on which for seven years she performed a variety of vocal works. In 1947 she began making regular concert tours, receiving wide acclaim for her consistently brilliant performances.
In the early 1950s Farrell performed concerts with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and in 1953 she became a regular performer with the Bach Aria Group. In 1956 she made her opera debut in Tampa, Florida, as Santuzza in Pietro Mascagni’s Cavalleria rusticana. That same year she debuted with the San Francisco Opera in Giuseppe Verdi’s Il trovatore. Her mastery of a wide variety of soprano roles garnered much praise from critics and earned her many roles, and in December 1960 she made her debut with the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York City in Christoph Gluck’s Alceste. She was firmly established thereafter as one of the best American dramatic sopranos.
Farrell was one of the few opera singers to be successful with popular songs. She recorded I Gotta Right to Sing the Blues, her first crossover album, in 1960, and her album Songs (1962) won a Grammy Award. In the mid-1970s she taught both classical and popular voice at Indiana University. Although she retired from performing, she continued to record the songs of composers such as Harold Arlen, Rodgers and Hart, Alec Wilder, and Johnny Mercer. Her autobiography, Can’t Help Singing (cowritten with Brian Kellow), was published in 1999.
