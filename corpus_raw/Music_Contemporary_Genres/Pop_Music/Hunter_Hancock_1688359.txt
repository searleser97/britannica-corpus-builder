Hunter Hancock is remembered as the first white disc jockey to play rhythm-and-blues records in southern California, where he went on the air on KFVD in 1943 playing his first love, jazz. On the advice of a friend, he began including a few “race” (rhythm-and-blues) records in his show, and his popularity soared. In the early 1950s he began moonlighting on another Los Angeles station, KGFJ, doing a show aimed at African-American listeners. A Texan and product of the Old South, Hancock now found himself ostracized by some white listeners. Nevertheless, his show, Huntin’ with Hunter, also known as Harlem Matinee, enjoyed great success into the mid-1960s.
