Rubén Blades, in full Rubén Dario Blades, Jr.,  (born July 16, 1948, Panama City, Panama), Panamanian musician, actor, and political activist who was one of the most successful and influential salsa musicians of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
Blades was born into a musically inclined family. His father, who was born in Colombia but raised in Panama, was a police detective and a bongo player, and his Cuban-born mother was a musician and an actress on radio soap operas. Blades initially played the guitar and sang North American rock and roll, but he later composed and performed songs of political protest. In 1972 he graduated with a law degree from the University of Panama. Shortly thereafter he and his family were sent into exile, when his father (a former member of the secret police) ran afoul of Manuel Noriega, then head of military intelligence.
After settling in New York City, Blades sang and composed as a member of the Willie Colón combo. He left Colón in 1982 to form a new group, Seis del Solar. The band’s salsa music incorporated rock and jazz elements, and vibraphones replaced traditional trumpets and trombones. With Seis del Solar he recorded Buscando América, which was named a Top Ten album of 1984. At the height of his popularity, Blades took a break from his musical career to earn a master’s degree (1985) in international law from Harvard University. In 1987 he won a Grammy Award for his album Escenas, in which Linda Ronstadt joined him in a Spanish duet, and the following year he released his first English-language album, Nothing but the Truth, which featured songs written or cowritten by Lou Reed, Elvis Costello, and Sting. His music echoed such social issues as the Iran-Contra affair and the AIDS crisis. Because of his success and activism, Blades became known as “the Latin Bruce Springsteen.”
In addition to being a musician, Blades was a successful film actor. His first role was in The Last Fight (1983), in which he starred alongside former bandmate Willie Colón. He followed with Crossover Dreams (1985) and received praise for his performances in such films as The Milagro Beanfield War (1988), Disorganized Crime (1989), The Super (1991), and Color of Night (1994). Blades also composed the musical score for the film Q & A (1990).
In 1994 Blades returned to Panama to run for the presidency. As the populist candidate of Papa Egoró (Mother Earth), the party that he had formed during a brief return to Panama in 1991, Blades campaigned with songs and guitar, attracting support from those disillusioned with corrupt politicians. His campaign, however, was underfinanced, and, although Blades proved a popular candidate, some thought that his extended absence from the country had left him out of touch. In the May 8, 1994, elections, he placed third, winning only 17 percent of the vote.
His defeat did nothing to curb his popularity, however, and Blades continued to record as well as act. He appeared in such films as Cradle Will Rock (1999) and Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003). His album Tiempos (1999) contains commentary on poverty and governmental corruption in Latin America, and the musically diverse Mundo (2002) won him the first of numerous Latin Grammy Awards. In 2003 Blades released Una Década, a compilation spanning 10 years of his career.
In 2004 Panamanian Pres. Martín Torrijos appointed Blades to his cabinet as minister of tourism. While Blades devoted much of his time to that position, he was still involved with music. He was a guest vocalist on Spanish Harlem Orchestra’s album Across 110th Street (2004), and in 2005 he was honoured by the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) with its Founders Award for lifetime achievement. After his political appointment ended, Blades released Cantares del subdesarrollo (2009), an acoustic album that pays tribute to Cuban music and culture. He then collaborated again with Seis del Solar for a two-volume concert recording, Todos vuelven live (2010).
Among Blades’s subsequent albums were Tangos (2014), which set some of his best-known salsa compositions to tango arrangements, and Son de Panamá (2015), a musical homage to his country that won him his eighth Grammy Award. He then teamed with Roberto Delgado & Orquesta to record Salsa Big Band (2017). It received the Grammy Award for best tropical Latin album and the Latin Grammy for best album of the year, among other honours. Blades reunited with that orchestra and assumed the persona of a Cuban octogenarian for Medoro Madera (2018), a collection of songs mostly from the 1920s and ’30s. His later albums included The Paraiso Road Gang (2019).
During this time, Blades continued to act, and he appeared in such films as Safe House (2012); For Greater Glory (2012), in which he portrayed Plutarco Elías Calles; and The Counselor (2013). He also had a recurring role (2015–17; 2019– ) on the television show Fear the Walking Dead.
