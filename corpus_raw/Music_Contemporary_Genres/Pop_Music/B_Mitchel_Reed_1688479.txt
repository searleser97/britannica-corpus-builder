In a career that spanned four decades, B. Mitchel Reed roamed the wide world of radio formats and established himself as a standout in both Top 40 and its flip side, free-form FM rock.  He began his radio career as a jazz announcer in Baltimore, Maryland, in the early 1950s, but his first fame came as a fast-talking deejay at KFWB in Los Angeles and WMCA in New York City (“I’m not talking too fast,” he once said, “you’re listening too slow”). By the time he moved to the pre-Top 40 KFWB, he was calling himself “the Boy on a Couch” and telling stories from sessions with his psychoanalyst between jazz cuts. When the station shifted to a rock-and-roll format, Reed became the rapid-fire “B.M.R.,” helping turn “Color Radio” into a success.
After five years at KFWB he accepted an offer from WMCA, duplicated his success in New York City, and returned to California. There he helped pioneer underground radio—first at KPPC in Pasadena, then most prominently at KMET, the “Mighty Met,” in Los Angeles. Reed decelerated his delivery to a jazz tempo and took a warm, conversational approach. Just as listeners had accepted his switch from mellow to manic in the late 1950s, so they welcomed his reversal a decade later. KMET went on to give KHJ, “Boss Radio,” its first strong challenger. A new generation of rock music and a new form of radio had arrived on stereo FM.
