Luther Vandross, in full Luther Ronzoni Vandross,  (born April 20, 1951, New York, New York, U.S.—died July 1, 2005, Edison, New Jersey), American soul and pop singer, songwriter, and producer whose widespread popularity and reputation as a consummate stylist began in the early 1980s.
While growing up in a public housing project on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, Vandross was encouraged to pursue music by his widowed mother. He began his professional career singing commercial jingles and background vocals and worked as a vocal arranger and songwriter, contributing “Everybody Rejoice” to the Broadway musical The Wiz in 1972. As a featured vocalist on the album The Glow of Love (1980) by the disco group Change, Vandross came to the attention of record executives and signed with Epic, which allowed him to write and produce his own material. In 1981 Vandross’s first album for that label, Never Too Much, sold more than one million copies, and its title song was a number-one rhythm-and-blues hit. So began a long string of million-selling albums that featured Vandross’s distinctive baritone, precise phrasing, and unabashedly romantic songs, including “Here and Now,” for which he won his first Grammy Award in 1990. His 1991 album Power of Love and the eponymous song “Power of Love/Love Power” both received Grammys, as did the song “Your Secret Love” (1996). In the process, Vandross became one of the most popular artists in the crossover genre called urban contemporary music. As a producer, Vandross was responsible for successful albums for Dionne Warwick and Aretha Franklin, who, along with the Supremes, influenced his music. In 2003 Vandross suffered a debilitating stroke shortly before the release of what proved to be his last studio album, Dance with My Father, which earned four Grammy Awards, including best R&B album, while the title track took the award for song of the year.
