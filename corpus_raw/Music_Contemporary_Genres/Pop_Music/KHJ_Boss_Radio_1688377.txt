Los Angeles’ KHJ, better known as “Boss Radio” in the mid-1960s, was the most imitated station of its time. After years of “personality” radio—dominated by deejay chatter and replete with long jingles—it ushered in the mainstreaming of Top 40 radio. Its designer, Bill Drake, a Georgia-born deejay, liked to keep things simple. As a budding programming consultant, he proved himself at three California stations (in Fresno, Stockton, and San Diego), succeeding with his formula of more music, less talk, shorter jingles, and the strategic placement of news, commercials, and other items that might cause listeners to tune out.
The RKO chain, Drake’s employer in San Diego, then gave him a real challenge: KHJ, a moribund station playing middle-of-the-road music and ranking 15th in the Los Angeles market. Drake hired the witty Robert W. Morgan from KEWB in Oakland, California, to work mornings; Morgan suggested fellow deejay The Real Don Steele for the afternoon drive-time shift; and, for program director, Drake brought in the energetic and creative Ron Jacobs, who had given Drake a run for his ratings in Fresno. KHJ soared to the top within six months, and Drake and his partner, Gene Chenault, began spreading the formula to other RKO stations. Programmers around the country taped KHJ and emulated its format, although most of them did it poorly. It was not only radio people who revered KHJ. Artists respected its power. One night in 1966, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys telephoned KHJ to ask if the station wanted to play a recording he had just completed. He then brought a tape to the station’s studios on Melrose Avenue, next to Paramount Studios, and KHJ became the first station to play “Good Vibrations.”
