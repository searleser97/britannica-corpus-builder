George M. Cohan, in full George Michael Cohan,  (born July 3, 1878, Providence, R.I., U.S.—died  Nov. 5, 1942, New York, N.Y.), American actor, popular songwriter, playwright, and producer especially of musical comedies, who became famous as the “Yankee Doodle Dandy.”
At an early age he performed with his parents and sister, subsequently taking comedy roles in vaudeville and on the legitimate stage. By 1893 he was writing vaudeville skits and popular songs. His first full-length play opened in New York in 1901. A description of his early experiments and the stage career of the “Four Cohans” is in his autobiography, Twenty Years on Broadway and the Years It Took to Get There (1925).
Among Cohan’s productions were The Governor’s Son (1901), Forty-five Minutes from Broadway (1906), The Talk of New York (1907), Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford (1910), Broadway Jones (1912), Seven Keys to Baldpate (1913), The Tavern (1921), The Song and Dance Man (1923), and American Born (1925). Among his best-known appearances were those in Ah, Wilderness! (1933) and I’d Rather Be Right (1937). He composed numerous songs, including “You’re a Grand Old Flag,” “Mary’s a Grand Old Name,” “Give My Regards to Broadway,” “I’m a Yankee Doodle Dandy,” and the famous “Over There” of World War I, for which Congress authorized him a special medal in 1940.
His career was the subject of a motion picture, Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), and a Broadway musical, George M! (1968).
