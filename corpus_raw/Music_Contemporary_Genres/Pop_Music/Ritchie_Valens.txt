Ritchie Valens, original name Richard Stephen Valenzuela,  (born May 13, 1941, Pacoima, California, U.S.—died February 3, 1959, near Clear Lake, Iowa), American singer and songwriter and the first Latino rock and roller. His short career ended when he died at age 17 in the 1959 plane crash in which Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper also perished.
Valens grew up in suburban Los Angeles in a family of Mexican-Indian extraction. While in high school, he used an electric guitar made in shop class to front a band and came to the attention of Bob Keane, owner of Del-Fi records, who produced the sessions at Gold Star Studios that resulted in Valens’s hits. His first hit, “Come On, Let’s Go” (1958), was followed later that year by “Donna,” a ballad written for an ex-girlfriend, and “La Bamba,” Valens’s best-remembered recording, a rock-and-roll reworking of a traditional Mexican wedding song, sung in Spanish (though Valens hardly spoke the language). He performed the Little Richard-inspired “Ooh! My Head” in the film Go, Johnny, Go (1959). Valens left a small legacy of recordings, but his compositions (often based on only three or four chords), exciting guitar style, emotional singing, and stylistic versatility influenced generations of rock musicians. His story is told in the film La Bamba (1987). In 2001 Valens was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
