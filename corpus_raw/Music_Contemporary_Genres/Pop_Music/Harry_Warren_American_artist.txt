Harry Warren, original name Salvatore Guaragna,  (born December 24, 1893, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died  September 22, 1981, Los Angeles, California), American songwriter who, by his own estimate, produced 300 to 400 songs from 1922 through 1960, many for Hollywood films and Broadway musical productions.
Warren received little public attention during his long life, despite three Academy Awards (for “Lullaby of Broadway” from Gold Diggers of 1935 [1935], “You’ll Never Know” from Hello Frisco, Hello [1943], and “On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe” from The Harvey Girls [1946]). Nevertheless, he amassed a fortune from his Depression-era contracts with major motion-picture studios and from royalty payments.
Self-taught musically and the 11th of 12 children, Warren toured with brass bands and carnivals from age 15. He worked as a property man for Vitagraph Studios and later played piano to accompany its silent films. He apprenticed as staff pianist and song promoter for the music publishers Stark & Cowan, who bought his first song, “Rose of the Rio Grande,” in 1922.
Warren wrote more than 60 popular songs for successful Broadway musicals into the early 1930s, collaborating with lyricists Mort Dixon and Joe Young on The Laugh Parade (1931), which included “You’re My Everything,” and with Dixon and Billy Rose on “I Found a Million Dollar Baby in a Five-and-Ten-Cent Store” for Crazy Quilt (1931). In 1932 he moved to Hollywood, entering into a major collaboration with lyricist Al Dubin that lasted through 1939. Together, they created music for such films as Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933; including “We’re in the Money”) and 42nd Street (1933; including the title song, as well as “You’re Getting to Be a Habit with Me” and “Shuffle Off to Buffalo”). Warren’s music fit the needs of the script rather than expressing a particular personal style.
During the 1940s Warren teamed with lyricist Mack Gordon to produce songs for a number of motion pictures, including Down Argentine Way (1940) and Sun Valley Serenade (1941; “Chattanooga Choo-Choo”). He also wrote “You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby” and “Jeepers, Creepers,” to lyrics by Johnny Mercer, as well as music for such films as Marty (1955), An Affair to Remember (1957), Jerry Lewis’s The Caddy (1953) and Cinderfella (1960), and Satan Never Sleeps (1962) and the theme for the 1955–61 television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp. He continued to compose but published little music after 1962.
Warren’s songs never went entirely out of style, and, beginning about 1990, his compositions were increasingly heard in television and in movies, with the trend continuing well into the 21st century. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971.
