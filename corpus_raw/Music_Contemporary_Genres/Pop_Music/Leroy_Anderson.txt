Leroy Anderson,  (born June 29, 1908, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.—died  May 18, 1975, Woodbury, Conn.), American conductor, arranger, and composer of “Sleigh Ride,” “Blue Tango,” and other popular light orchestral music with memorable, optimistic melodies and often unusual percussion effects.
The son of Swedish immigrants, Anderson studied composition under Walter Piston and Georges Enesco at Harvard University (B.A., 1929; M.A., 1930), where he also studied German and Scandinavian languages and directed the Harvard University Band. Anderson’s fluency in nine languages aided him as a U.S. Army interpreter during World War II; he also served in the army during the Korean War.
In 1936 Anderson began a long and productive association with the Boston Pops Orchestra’s principal conductor Arthur Fiedler. With “Syncopated Clock” in 1945 Anderson began the period of his greatest popularity. Fiedler introduced that piece as well as standard Anderson works such as “Fiddle-Faddle,” “Sleigh Ride,” and the Irish Suite of traditional tunes.
Anderson conducted his own orchestras during the 1950s in hit recordings such as “Blue Tango,” “Plink, Plank, Plunk!,” and “Belle of the Ball.” He used a typewriter as a musical instrument in “The Typewriter,” and he used sandpaper to imitate soft-shoe dancers in “Sandpaper Ballet.” His later projects included composing the music for Goldilocks, a 1958 Broadway musical. A survey by the American Symphony Orchestra League in 1953 determined that among American composers, Anderson’s works were the most frequently performed.
