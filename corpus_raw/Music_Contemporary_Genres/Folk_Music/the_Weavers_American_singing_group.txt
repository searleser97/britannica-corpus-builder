The Weavers,  seminal American folksinging group of the late 1940s and ’50s. The original members were Lee Hays (b. 1914, Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S.—d. August 26, 1981, Croton-on-Hudson, New York), Ronnie Gilbert (b. September 7, 1926, New York, New York—d. June 6, 2015, Mill Valley, California), Fred Hellerman (b. May 13, 1927, New York—d. September 1, 2016, Weston, Connecticut), and Pete Seeger (b. May 3, 1919, New York—d. January 27, 2014, New York). Later members were Erik Darling (b. September 25, 1933, Baltimore, Maryland—d. August 3, 2008, Chapel Hill, North Carolina), Frank Hamilton (b. October 3, 1934, New York), and Bernie Krause (b. December 8, 1938, Detroit, Michigan).
In 1948 Hays and guitarist-banjoist Seeger, both of whom previously had performed with Woody Guthrie in the Almanac Singers, recruited Gilbert and guitarist Hellerman to form the Weavers. They built up an extensive repertoire of traditional folk ballads and new songs, making their mark at the Village Vanguard in New York City’s Greenwich Village in 1949. The quartet gained almost instant commercial success. Amid accusations of communist sympathies during the Red Scare, however, they were blacklisted and compelled to disband between 1952 and 1955, when Seeger and Hays were called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. After Seeger quit in 1958 to pursue a solo career, he was replaced by Darling (1958–62), Hamilton (1962–63), and Krause (1963).
The Weavers, who officially disbanded in 1963, made numerous songs into modern classics, including the Israeli folk song “Tzena, Tzena, Tzena,” “Good Night Irene” (by Leadbelly), “So Long, It’s Been Good to Know You” (Guthrie), “Kisses Sweeter than Wine” (Hellerman), and such Seeger-Hays compositions as “If I Had a Hammer” and “Lonesome Traveler.” An acclaimed documentary film, Wasn’t That a Time, chronicled their 1980 reunion concert in New York City’s Carnegie Hall. The group received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2006.
