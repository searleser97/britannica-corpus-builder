Bongo drums, also called bongos,  pair of small single-headed Afro-Cuban drums. The two heads, which are respectively about 5 inches (13 cm) and about 7 inches (18 cm) across, are nailed or rod-tensioned to wooden, open-ended “shells” of the same height. Played with the hands and fingers, the drums are yoked together to help the performer execute lively rhythmic dialogues. Bongo drums were created about 1900 in Cuba for Latin American dance bands. Other Cuban folk drums are also called bongos.
