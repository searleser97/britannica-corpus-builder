Lamellaphone,  any musical instrument consisting of a set of tuned metal or bamboo tongues (lamellae) of varying length attached at one end to a soundboard that often has a box or calabash resonator. Board-mounted lamellaphones are often played inside gourds or bowls for increased resonance, and the timbre may be modified by attaching rattling devices to the board or resonator or by attaching metal cuffs at the base of the tongues.
Lamellaphones are typically classified as plucked idiophones—instruments whose sounding parts are resonant solids. This term, however, is not entirely accurate, because the tongues of many lamellaphones are not plucked but rather depressed and released with the thumbs and fingers; such instruments are often called thumb pianos.
African lamellaphones were described by European travelers as early as 1586. Indeed, the instruments are distributed throughout the sub-Saharan region, where they are widely known as mbira, likembe, or kalimba, and they are found in the same regions as xylophones, with which they may share similar tunings and local names. African lamellaphones are commonly played as an accompaniment to song, but in some areas they are used as purely instrumental music. They were introduced to Latin America by African slaves during the 19th century.
Other common lamellaphones include music boxes and jew’s harps. The metal lamellae of a music box are plucked mechanically inside a box resonator. The tongue of a jew’s harp, however, is usually plucked with the thumb or made to vibrate by plucking the instrument’s frame or jerking it with a string; the resonator of a jew’s harp is the player’s mouth.
