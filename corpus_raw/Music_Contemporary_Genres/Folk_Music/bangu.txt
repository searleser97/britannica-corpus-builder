Bangu, Wade-Giles romanization pan-ku, also called danpi,  Chinese frame drum that, when struck by one or two small bamboo sticks, creates a sharp dry sound essential to the aesthetics of Chinese opera. It is also used in many Chinese chamber music ensembles. The drum, which is about 25 cm (10 inches) in diameter and 10 cm (4 inches) deep, consists of an animal skin stretched over wooden wedges; the skin and wedges are wrapped by a metal band. The wedges do not reach the small area in the centre (the drum’s “heart,” guxin) where the drum is struck. The bangu is held in its own stand; its player leads the ensemble.
