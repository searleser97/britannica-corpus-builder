Tom Paxton, in full Thomas Richard Paxton,  (born October 31, 1937, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.), American folk singer-songwriter who was especially prominent in the folk music revival of the 1960s.
After studying drama at the University of Oklahoma and serving in the U.S. Army, Paxton joined the folk music scene in New York City, singing and playing acoustic guitar in small folk clubs. Despite a substantial following as a performer, he became more widely known as a composer. Paxton’s work ranged from sorrowful ballads (“The Last Thing on My Mind,” “Ramblin’ Boy”) to topical political and social protest songs (“Whose Garden Was This,” “Peace Will Come”) to children’s tunes (“The Marvelous Toy,” “Jennifer’s Rabbit”). He was particularly noted for his perceptive lyrics and for his use of insightful humour and satire. Paxton continued to perform and record into the early 21st century. He received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2009.
