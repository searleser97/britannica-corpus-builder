Mimi Fariña, original name Margarita Mimi Baez,  (born April 30, 1945, Stanford, Calif., U.S.—died July 18, 2001, Mill Valley, Calif.), American folk singer and social activist who, with her first husband, Richard Fariña, helped revitalize folk music in the 1960s. She was the younger sister of folk singer Joan Baez.
Mimi and Richard Fariña were married in 1963, and the two began performing together. The duo released two popular albums, Celebrations for a Grey Day (1965) and Reflections in a Crystal Wind (1966). After Richard’s death in a motorcycle accident in 1966, she continued to make recordings, including Take Heart (1971), a duo album with Tom Jans. In 1974 she founded Bread & Roses, a charity that organizes musical shows for audiences in nursing homes, hospitals, homeless and drug rehabilitation centres, and correctional facilities. Her final recording was a solo effort simply titled Solo (1985). While it contained some original material, half of the tracks had been previously recorded by Mimi or her sister Joan.
