Sanxian, (Chinese: “three strings”)  Wade Giles romanization san-hsien also called xianzi,  any of a group of long-necked, fretless Chinese lutes. The instrument’s rounded rectangular resonator has a snakeskin front and back, and the curved-back pegbox at the end of the neck has lateral, or side, tuning pegs that adjust three silk or nylon strings. The sanxian is made in several sizes. The largest variety, popular in northern China and approximately 4 feet (122 cm) long, usually accompanies epic singing and has a compass of three octaves; it first appeared in the mid-19th century. The small variety, popular in southern China, is used for music drama performances. The most common sanxian is about 3 feet (95 cm) long. It is played by plucking the strings either with the fingernails of the right hand or with a plectrum. Sanxian performance is characterized by powerful, resonant rolls and chords and large glissandos. It is popular in theatrical accompaniment, ballad-singing accompaniment, and the orchestra. In the 20th century, the musicians Bai Fengyan (1899–1975) and Li Yi (b. 1932) made the sanxian popular as a solo instrument.
Some scholars think that the sanxian is of Central Asian origin, but others disagree. The image of a sanxian is found in a stone sculpture of the Southern Song period (1217–79), and its name is first recorded in a document of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
