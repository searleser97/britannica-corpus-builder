Jinghu, Wade-Giles romanization ching-hu,  Chinese two-stringed fiddle that is the principal melodic instrument in jingxi (Peking opera) ensembles. The smallest (and therefore highest-pitched) of the Chinese spike fiddles (huqin), the jinghu is about 50 cm (20 inches) in length. Its body is a bamboo tube, covered at the playing end with snakeskin. Pegs at the back of the slim bamboo neck hold the strings, which are traditionally made of silk. The jinghu is related to the larger erhu.
