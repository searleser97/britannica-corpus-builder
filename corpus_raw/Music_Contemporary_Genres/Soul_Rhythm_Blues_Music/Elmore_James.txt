Elmore James, original name Elmore Brooks,  (born January 27, 1918, Richland, Mississippi, U.S.—died May 24, 1963, Chicago, Illinois), American blues singer-guitarist noted for the urgent intensity of his singing and guitar playing. Known as the “King of the Slide Guitar,” he was a significant influence on the development of rock music.
Born into a sharecropping family, James played guitar in his teens and toured the Mississippi Delta with Robert Johnson, the principal influence on his music, in the late 1930s. He then performed in the South with the second Sonny Boy Williamson (Alex, or Aleck, “Rice” Miller) before becoming a mainstay of Chicago blues in the 1950s. He recorded several versions of his 1952 hit “Dust My Broom” and repeated that song’s opening guitar chorus on many later recordings. Characteristically, his singing was harsh, including shouted phrases, and his vivid slide guitar replies featured heavy amplifier reverberation. His most-praised work began in 1958 and included the slow blues songs “The Sky Is Crying” (1959) and “It Hurts Me Too” (1965). Numerous rock musicians, including the Rolling Stones and Eric Clapton, adopted his hard-driving style and often recorded his songs. James was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.
