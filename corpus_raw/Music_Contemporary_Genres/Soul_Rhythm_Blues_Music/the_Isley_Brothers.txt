the Isley Brothers,  American rhythm-and-blues and rock band that began recording in the late 1950s and continued to have hit records in the 1960s and ’70s with music that ranged from rhythm and blues to soul to funk. The original members were Kelly Isley (byname of O’Kelly Isley, Jr.; b. December 25, 1937, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—d. March 31, 1986), Rudolph Isley (b. April 1, 1939, Cincinnati), and Ronald Isley (b. May 21, 1941, Cincinnati). Later members included Ernie Isley (b. March 7, 1952, Cincinnati), Marvin Isley (b. August 18, 1953, Cincinnati—d. June 6, 2010, Chicago, Illinois), and Chris Jasper (b. December 30, 1951, Cincinnati).
After performing gospel music with their mother in and around their native Cincinnati, Kelly, Rudolph, and Ronald Isley gained pop recognition in 1959 with their composition “Shout.” In 1962 the trio’s rollicking cover version of the Top Notes’ “Twist and Shout” remained on Billboard’s pop chart for 11 weeks.
The Isleys began their own record company, T-Neck Records, in 1964, shortly thereafter recruiting budding guitarist Jimi Hendrix for their band. They abandoned T-Neck and signed with Motown in 1965. The group had a hit a year later with “This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You).” The Isleys’ sound was rawer than standard-issue Motown, however, and they restarted T-Neck in 1969, developing an increasingly funky fusion of rock and soul, most notably on “It’s Your Thing” (1969). Joined by younger brothers Ernie and Marvin and brother-in-law Chris Jasper in 1973, the Isleys scored hits with “That Lady (Part 1)” (1973), “Fight the Power (Part 1)” (1975), and “For the Love of You (Part 1 and 2)” (1975).
The Isley Brothers continued to perform and to record well into the 21st century. The album Power of Peace, a collaboration with Santana, appeared in 2017. In 1992 the Isley Brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and they received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2014.
