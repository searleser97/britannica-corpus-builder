Record store owners Vivian Carter (“Vee”) and James Bracken (“Jay”), later husband and wife, formed Vee Jay Records in 1953. (At various times the company’s labels also read VJ or Vee-Jay.) With Carter’s brother Calvin as producer and Ewart Abner in charge of promotion, Vee Jay became the most successful black-owned record company of its period. Jimmy Reed made more commercial blues records than Chess managed to produce; without ever sounding like rock and roll, his simple, hypnotic grooves were jukebox staples through the early 1960s, when both he and John Lee Hooker became bedrock influences on the emerging British blues movement.
Vee Jay reached the pop charts mostly through vocal groups, starting in 1954 with “Goodnite, Sweetheart, Goodnite” by the Spaniels, continuing with “For Your Precious Love” by Jerry Butler and the Impressions in 1958, and reaching a pinnacle with a string of hits by the Four Seasons in the early 1960s. When Capitol refused its option to release several Beatles singles—as well as their first American album, Introducing . . . the Beatles (1964)—Vee Jay jumped at the opportunity, taking the album to number two and four singles to the Top Five.  Ironically, overexpansion in the wake of this success contributed to the bankruptcy that befell the company soon after.
