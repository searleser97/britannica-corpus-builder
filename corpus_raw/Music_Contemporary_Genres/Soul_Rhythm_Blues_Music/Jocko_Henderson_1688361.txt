For seven years beginning in the mid-1950s, Douglas  (“Jocko”) Henderson commuted daily between Philadelphia, where he broadcast on WDAS, and New York City, where his two-hour late-evening Rocket Ship Show on WLIB was a particularly wild ride. “Hey, mommio, hey, daddio,” he announced, “this is your spaceman Jocko . . . three, two, one: blast-off time!” At a time when many black rhythm-and-blues disc jockeys were urged by their station owners to rant and rave, Henderson delivered smooth, finger-snapping rhymes following the model of deejay Maurice (“Hot Rod”) Hulbert, who had done a stint in Henderson’s hometown of Baltimore, Maryland.
Henderson also staged rhythm-and-blues and rock-and-roll concerts at the Apollo Theatre and Loew’s State Theater—holding his own with Alan Freed, who promoted similar shows—and he became the first African-American host of a live TV show from New York City. Henderson, who also worked at stations WADO and WOV in New York City, continued his Philadelphia show into the 1970s, and he appeared on the New York City oldies station WCBS well into the ’90s.
