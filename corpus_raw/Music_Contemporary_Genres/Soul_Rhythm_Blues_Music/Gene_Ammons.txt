Gene Ammons, byname Jug, original name Eugene Ammons,  (born April 14, 1925, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died August 6, 1974, Chicago), American jazz tenor saxophonist, noted for his big sound and blues-inflected, “soulful” improvising.
The son of outstanding boogie-woogie pianist Albert Ammons, Gene Ammons grew up in Chicago and first became nationally known as a member of Billy Eckstine’s innovative bebop big band during 1944–47; he also played in Woody Herman’s big band (1949). He and versatile saxophonist Sonny Stitt then formed a touring band (1950–52) that featured their improvised “battles”; Ammons spent the rest of his career leading his own groups. At the height of his popularity, Ammons served a prison sentence (1962–69) for a narcotics violation.
Ammons’s 1950 recording “My Foolish Heart” was a rhythm-and-blues hit. For most of his career, he played straightforward lyrical jazz, at first in a style strongly influenced by Lester Young. As he developed a rich tone, he used rests and dynamic contrasts to create vivid phrasing in blues (“Blue Hymn”) and standard songs (“Exactly Like You,” “Angel Eyes”). He was among the first jazz saxophonists to work regularly in the popular tenor saxophone and organ “soul” idiom; his melodic variations and dramatic instincts lent character and musical integrity to otherwise sentimental material. He recorded a series of all-star albums with the likes of trumpeter Art Farmer and saxophonist John Coltrane in the 1950s, and later he performed frequently with fellow bebop saxophonists who included Stitt, James Moody, and Dexter Gordon.
