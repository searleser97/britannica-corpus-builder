Jimmy Rushing, byname of James Andrew Rushing,  (born August 26, 1903?, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, U.S.—died June 8, 1972, New York, New York), American blues and jazz singer who was best known for performing with the Count Basie Orchestra.
Rushing was born into a musical family in the early 1900s (sources differ on his birth year). He joined Count Basie’s first group in 1935, gaining exposure through many recordings, and remained until 1950. He thereafter led his own small groups or worked with the bands of Benny Goodman, Buck Clayton, and occasionally Basie. Rushing’s full tenor voice, although associated with the blues-based repertoire of the Basie period, was also well suited to popular songs and ballads.
