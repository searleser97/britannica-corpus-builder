The Four Tops,  American vocal group that was one of Motown’s most popular acts in the 1960s. The members were Renaldo (“Obie”) Benson (b. June 14, 1936, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.—d. July 1, 2005, Detroit), Abdul (“Duke”) Fakir (b. December 26, 1935, Detroit), Lawrence Payton (b. 1938, Detroit—d. June 20, 1997, Southfield, Michigan), and Levi Stubbs (byname of Levi Stubbles; b. June 6, 1936, Detroit—d. October 17, 2008, Detroit).
The Four Tops formed after singing together at a party in 1953, calling themselves until 1956 the Four Aims. They spent a decade performing primarily jazz-oriented material in clubs and releasing poorly received singles before signing with Motown Records. Under the stewardship of Motown’s premier songwriting and producing team, Holland-Dozier-Holland (Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland), the Four Tops became consistent hit makers, registering their first hit, “Baby I Need Your Loving,” in 1964. “I Can’t Help Myself” (number one on the pop and  rhythm-and-blues charts in the United States) and “It’s the Same Old Song” followed in 1965, establishing the group’s signature sound: Stubbs’s gruff, passionate lead vocals set against gentler background harmonies. The group reached a pinnacle of fame in 1966 with its second million-seller, “Reach Out I’ll Be There.” Splitting with Motown in 1972 when the label relocated to California but returning for another five-year stint with the company in the mid-1980s, the group’s original lineup continued to tour and record together throughout the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s. The Four Tops were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.
