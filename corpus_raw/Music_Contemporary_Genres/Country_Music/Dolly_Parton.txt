Dolly Parton, in full Dolly Rebecca Parton,  (born January 19, 1946, Locust Ridge, Tennessee, U.S.), American country music singer, guitarist, and actress best known for pioneering the interface between country and pop music styles.
Parton was born into a poor farming family, the fourth of 12 children. She displayed an aptitude and passion for music at an early age, and as a child she was a featured singer and guitarist on local radio and television shows in Knoxville, Tennessee. In 1964, immediately following her high school graduation, she set out for Nashville to pursue a career in music.
In Nashville Parton became the protégée of country music singer and Grand Ole Opry star Porter Wagoner. Through repeated appearances on Wagoner’s syndicated television show, Parton gained coast-to-coast recognition. She soon attracted the attention of the music industry moguls at RCA Records and subsequently recorded more than a dozen hit songs—together with Wagoner—on the RCA label. Owing much to her association with Wagoner, Parton rapidly emerged as one of country music’s most popular singers.
In 1974 Parton discontinued her work with Wagoner to launch a solo career, in which she enjoyed immediate success: in both 1975 and ’76 she was chosen female singer of the year by the Country Music Association (CMA) on the strength of such songs as “Jolene” and “Love Is Like a Butterfly” (both 1974). About the same time, Parton began to cross over to the pop music market, and in 1978 she won a Grammy Award for her song “Here You Come Again” and was named entertainer of the year by the CMA. As her career developed, Parton received more Grammys, both for her songs, including “9 to 5” (1980) and “Shine” (2001), and for her albums, including Trio (1987; with Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris) and The Grass Is Blue (1999). Parton was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1999, and she continued to release hit albums, including Blue Smoke (2014) and Pure & Simple (2016). In 2017 she released an album for children, I Believe in You.
In the 1980s Parton appeared in several successful films, most notably Nine to Five (1980; also known as 9 to 5) and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982), for which she revived one of her most popular songs, “I Will Always Love You” (1974). (Whitney Houston later recorded the song for the film The Bodyguard [1992], and it went on to sell millions of copies.) In 1989 Parton played a principal role in Steel Magnolias. In the 1990s and 2000s she guest-starred in many television series and appeared in several made-for-television movies. In 2009 Parton wrote the music and lyrics for a Broadway musical adaptation of the film 9 to 5. Three years later she starred in the film Joyful Noise. A TV movie about her early life, Dolly Parton’s Coat of Many Colors (2015), took its name from her 1971 song and was followed the next year by a Christmas-themed sequel, in which Parton appeared. She provided the music and was the guiding spirit behind the movie Dumplin’ (2018). Her music also inspired Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings, an anthology series that debuted on Netflix in 2019; she was featured in the program. She later portrayed an angel in Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square (2020), which also appeared on Netflix.
Aside from her stage and screen activities, Parton was involved in a broad array of other projects. In 1986 she opened Dollywood—a theme park centred on Appalachian traditions—in the Great Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee. Two years later she created the Dollywood Foundation, an organization with the aim of providing inspiration and educational resources to children. In 1994 Parton published her autobiography, Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business, which was a best seller in the United States.
Parton’s contributions to the arts and culture of the United States earned her numerous awards from organizations beyond the music and film industry. She was named a Living Legend by the Library of Congress in 2004 for her enrichment of the American cultural heritage. In 2005 she received the U.S. government’s National Medal of Arts, and in 2006 she was recognized at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., for her lifetime artistic achievement. The memoir Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics (cowritten by Robert K. Oermann) was published in 2020.
