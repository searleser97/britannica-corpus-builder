Lyle Lovett, in full Lyle Pierce Lovett,  (born November 1, 1957, Klein, Texas, U.S.), American singer and songwriter whose witty lyrics and use of diverse musical genres provided a unique take on country music.
Lovett spent his early years listening primarily to country music and the blues, and he was inspired by Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, Nat King Cole, and Ray Charles. After earning degrees in journalism and German from Texas A&M University in 1982, Lovett spent several years abroad. During a concert in Luxembourg he met the band that became the nucleus of his Large Band, and in 1984 they made a demo album that led to his first big record contract.
Lovett established a solid country following with his first album, Lyle Lovett (1986), and continued to acquire new fans with his many genre-bending deviations from traditional country themes and instrumentation. The records that followed—Pontiac (1988); Lyle Lovett and His Large Band (1989), which won a Grammy Award for best country vocal performance, male; Joshua Judges Ruth (1992); I Love Everybody (1994); and The Road to Ensenada (1996), which took the Grammy for best country album—collectively displayed a range of emotions and an intellectual depth not usually encountered in the music industry. Lovett consistently pushed the envelope by refusing to write music that could be easily categorized. His later albums included Step Inside This House (1998), in which he covered artists who had inspired him; My Baby Don’t Tolerate (2003); It’s Not Big It’s Large (2007); Natural Forces (2009); and Release Me (2012).
Lovett also acted in such films as The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Ready to Wear (1994), and The Open Road (2009). In 1996 he appeared in the made-for-television movie Bastard Out of Carolina, and he later had a recurring role on the TV series The Bridge (2013–14). Shy and unassuming by nature, Lovett was thrown into the media spotlight in 1993 when he married actress Julia Roberts after only a one-month courtship; the couple split amicably in 1995.
