Anne Murray, in full Morna Anne Murray,  (born June 20, 1945, Springhill, Nova Scotia, Canada), widely honoured Canadian country singer known for such popular songs as “Snowbird,” “A Little Good News,” and covers of songs by artists such as the Beatles and Kenny Loggins. She was the first female Canadian solo artist to reach number one on music charts in the United States and the first woman solo artist and Canadian singer to win Album of the Year (A Little Good News, 1984) at the Country Music Association Awards. She sold more than 50 million albums worldwide.
In her youth Murray studied piano for six years and started taking voice lessons at age 15. She attended the University of New Brunswick, where she took a degree in physical education in 1966. She pursued her singing career during that period as well, winning a spot on the television series Singalong Jubilee in 1966 and on Let’s Go in 1967. She released her debut album, What About Me, in 1968. The Canadian branch of Capitol Records gave her a contract the following year.
Murray struck it big with her hit “Snowbird” in 1970, which became a Top Ten crossover hit in pop, adult contemporary, and country. Murray suddenly became one of the most coveted singers in North America, appearing regularly on TV on such programs as The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, American Bandstand, and Saturday Night Live. She earned Grammy Awards for “Love Song” (1974), “You Needed Me” (1978), “Could I Have This Dance” (1980), and “A Little Good News” (1983) and countless Juno Awards in Canada.
After a dip in her career in the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, she made headlines once more with a successful duet with Bryan Adams ("What Would It Take," 1996), the album What a Wonderful World (1997, platinum in both Canada and the U.S.), and the hugely successful holiday album What a Wonderful Christmas (2001). In 2007 she released Duets: Friends and Legends, a compilation of her best-known songs recorded as duets with other female musicians, among them Céline Dion, k.d. lang, Carole King, and Emmylou Harris. Murray staged a final tour in 2008 and effectively retired from the music industry. She published her biography, All of Me (co-written with Michael Posner), in 2009.
