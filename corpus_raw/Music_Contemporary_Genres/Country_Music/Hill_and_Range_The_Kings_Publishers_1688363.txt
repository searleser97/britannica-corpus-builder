When Austrian immigrant brothers Jean and Julian Aberbach formed their Hill and Range publishing company in 1945, the name they chose made it clear which songwriters they were after—the country-and-western writers who had been long overlooked by the established publishers affiliated with the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). Offering a 75–25 percent split to writers instead of the customary 50–50, Hill and Range published several leading country singers, including Bob Wills, Ernest Tubb, Bill Monroe, and Hank Snow.  In 1955 Snow’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, took on a new protégé, Elvis Presley, and orchestrated a buyout of his contract with the Memphis-based label Sun Records by securing substantial payments not only from Presley’s new label, RCA Victor, but also from Hill and Range. Although he was not a songwriter, Presley was guaranteed half the publishers’ share of income from any Hill and Range song he recorded, plus one-third of the songwriting share.  With this arrangement with Presley in place, Hill and Range was for several years able to take its pick from songs written by some of the best writers of the era, including Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, and Otis Blackwell.
