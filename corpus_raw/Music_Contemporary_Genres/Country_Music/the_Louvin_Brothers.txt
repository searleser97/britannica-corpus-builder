The Louvin Brothers,  American country music vocal duo of the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s, remembered for their simple but pure gospel-tinged style and distinctive harmonies. The members were Ira Louvin (original name Ira Lonnie Loudermilk; b. April 21, 1924, Henagar, Alabama, U.S.—d. June 20, 1965, Williamsburg, Missouri) and Charlie Louvin (original name Charlie Elzer Loudermilk; b. July 7, 1927, Henagar, Alabama—d. January 26, 2011, Wartrace, Tennessee).
Growing up in rural northeastern Alabama, the Loudermilk brothers were exposed to a variety of early country music influences, including the Carter Family, Charlie and Bill Monroe, and the Blue Sky Boys, as well as to shape-note hymnal singing. From the early 1940s they sang devoutly Christian songs in an artless, heartfelt manner, their high-pitched harmonies accompanied only by Ira’s mandolin and Charlie’s guitar. During one of their regular stints as live performers on radio stations in the Southeast, they changed their name to the Louvin Brothers. Commercial success came when they adopted secular themes; among their hits were “When I Stop Dreaming,” released in 1955—the year they joined the Grand Ole Opry—and “I Don’t Believe You’ve Met My Baby” (1956). On later recordings their record companies imposed lush, elaborate accompaniments far removed from their original style. Each brother pursued a solo career after the partnership broke up in 1963, and Ira was killed in a 1965 car crash.
Often called the greatest duet act in country music, the Louvin Brothers influenced such artists as the Everly Brothers, Gram Parsons, and Emmylou Harris. The Louvin Brothers also were much-revered songwriters, and their compositions have been covered by many performers. In 2001 they were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and in 2015 the duo received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.
