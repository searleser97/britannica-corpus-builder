Rascal Flatts,  American country music trio that achieved success with a crossover sound that appealed to the pop market. The members were lead vocalist Gary LeVox (original name Gary Wayne Vernon, Jr.; b. July 10, 1970, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.), bassist Jay DeMarcus (in full Stanley Wayne DeMarcus, Jr.; b. April 26, 1971, Columbus), and guitarist Joe Don Rooney (b. September 13, 1975, Baxter Springs, Kansas).
Cousins LeVox and DeMarcus moved from Columbus, Ohio, to Nashville to pursue musical careers in the mid-1990s. DeMarcus played in the backing band of country vocalist Chely Wright, and he and LeVox performed regularly in the Nashville club scene. When their regular guitarist was unable to appear at a session, DeMarcus recruited Rooney, whom he knew from Wright’s band, to join them. The trio had an easy chemistry, and they decided to form Rascal Flatts in 1999. They signed to Disney’s Lyric Street Records imprint and released the self-titled Rascal Flatts in 2000. The album went platinum on the strength of the group’s breakout single “Prayin’ for Daylight,” which reached number three on the Billboard country chart and broke into the Top 40 on the mainstream pop chart.
The band followed with Melt (2002), a ballad-heavy collection that featured “These Days,” a single that dominated the country charts and gave the group its first number one hit. Melt fared equally well on the country album chart, reaching number one and spending two years in the top 100. This success was surpassed with the trio’s subsequent releases—Feels like Today (2004), Me and My Gang (2006), Still Feels Good (2007), and Unstoppable (2009)—each of which reached the top of Billboard’s all-genre album chart. The hit singles “What Hurts the Most” (2006), a rueful ballad, and “Life Is a Highway” (2006), a rollicking tune featured on the soundtrack to the animated film Cars, contributed to the act’s growing mainstream popularity. During this time, Rascal Flatts also won accolades from its peers, collecting the Country Music Association (CMA) award for best new artist in 2002 and dominating the vocal group category from 2003 to 2008.
After Disney shuttered the Lyric Street label, Rascal Flatts in July 2010 signed with Big Machine Records, best known as the home of country superstar Taylor Swift. The band then released the studio albums Nothing like This (2010), Changed (2012), and Rewind (2014), all of which debuted at number one on the Billboard country album chart. Back to Us (2017) was the group’s 12th album to reach the Top Ten on that chart.
