Tammy Wynette, original name Virginia Wynette Pugh,  (born May 5, 1942, Itawamba county, Mississippi, U.S.—died April 6, 1998, Nashville, Tennessee), American singer, who was revered as the “first lady of country music” from the 1950s to the ’80s, perhaps best known for her 1968 hit “Stand by Your Man.”
Wynette’s life personified the theme of a rags-to-riches country song. Her father, a musician, died when she was an infant, and her mother moved to Birmingham, Alabama, to work in an aircraft factory. The young Wynette was left to be raised by her grandparents on their cotton farm. Wynette, who married one month before her high school graduation in 1959, worked as a beautician, sang in nightclubs, and appeared on Porter Wagoner’s nationally syndicated country music television show. In 1966 she left her husband and moved with their three daughters to Nashville, Tennessee, where she signed a contract with Epic Records.
Renamed Tammy by producer Billy Sherrill, Wynette recorded her first hit in 1967, the single “Apartment Number Nine,” which was followed by “Your Good Girl’s Gonna Go Bad” (1967), “I Don’t Wanna Play House” (1967)—for which she won the first of three Grammy Awards—and “D-I-V-O-R-C-E” (1968). With Sherrill she cowrote her anthem, “Stand by Your Man” (1968), which quickly jumped to the top of the country music charts.
She married country music star George Jones in 1969. Known as “Mr. and Mrs. Country Music,” they recorded many duet hits. Despite their divorce in 1975, the two continued recording together, including on Wynette’s last album, One (1996).
Although plagued by personal problems—she was abducted from a shopping mall and beaten, filed for bankruptcy, and was treated for prescription-drug addiction and a series of health problems that resulted in some 30 operations—Wynette was one of the most successful female vocalists in the history of country music. Her recordings had sales of more than $100 million, and she had 20 number one hits throughout her career. She was a three-time winner of the Country Music Association’s female vocalist of the year award (1968–70), and in 1998 she was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame. Wynette’s autobiography, Stand by Your Man, was published in 1979 and filmed in 1982.
