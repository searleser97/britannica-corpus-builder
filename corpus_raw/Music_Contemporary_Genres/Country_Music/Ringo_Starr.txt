Ringo Starr, byname of Sir Richard Starkey,  (born July 7, 1940, Liverpool, Merseyside, England), British musician, singer, songwriter, and actor who was the drummer for the Beatles, one of the most influential bands in rock history. He also found success in a solo career.
Starkey was born in a working-class area of Liverpool. His parents, both bakery workers, divorced when he was a small child. Frequently ill, he spent a year in the hospital with complications from a burst appendix when he was six years old and a further two years in a sanatorium after he acquired pleurisy at the age of 13. During the latter episode he was introduced to the drums by a health worker who gave children musical instruments to amuse them. Starkey did not return to school after his release from the sanatorium but worked at various jobs, eventually becoming an apprentice joiner for an engineering company, where he and other employees formed a skiffle band. In 1959 he became the drummer for another skiffle band, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, and adopted his stage name. The band became quite popular, and it was during a shared 1960 engagement in Hamburg, West Germany, that Starr became acquainted with the Beatles (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Pete Best).
In 1962 Starr replaced Best as drummer for the Beatles. He underpinned the band with a straightforward steady beat and won over fans with his engaging personality. Though his vocal skills were limited, he did take the lead on a handful of songs, including “Boys” on the band’s 1963 debut album, Please Please Me, and its first American release, Introducing the Beatles (1964); “Honey Don’t” on Beatles for Sale in the United Kingdom and Beatles ’65 in the United States (both 1964); “Act Naturally” on Help! (1965); and “With a Little Help from My Friends” on Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). In the late 1960s Starr began songwriting, contributing “Octopus’s Garden” to Abbey Road (1969).
The members of the Beatles had all launched separate careers before the band officially broke up in 1970. Starr appeared in films, including The Magic Christian (1969), and his first two solo albums, Sentimental Journey, consisting of standards from the 1930s and ’40s, and Beaucoups of Blues, a collection of country music, were both released in 1970. He also had several hit singles during the 1970s, notably “It Don’t Come Easy” (1971), “Back Off Boogaloo” (1972), and “Photograph” and “You’re Sixteen” (both 1973). Starr continued to release albums and to play on solo records for Lennon and Harrison, but his successes became more modest as time went on.
Starr later played the Conductor in the children’s television series Shining Time Station (1989–93) and was nominated (1989) for an Emmy Award. He published two books of photography, Postcards from the Boys (2004) and Photograph (2015). He formed his first All-Starr Band in 1989 and embarked the following year on the first of a continuing series of tours with various incarnations of the All-Starr Band, enjoying a thriving if low-key career punctuated by appearances at Beatles retrospectives. Solo studio albums featuring tracks written and recorded by Starr and members of his All-Starr Band included Choose Love (2005), Postcards from Paradise (2015), Give More Love (2017), and What’s My Name (2019).
In 2015 Starr was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, receiving the Award for Musical Excellence; the Beatles were inducted in 1988. Starr was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1965, and he received a knighthood in the 2018 New Year Honours.
