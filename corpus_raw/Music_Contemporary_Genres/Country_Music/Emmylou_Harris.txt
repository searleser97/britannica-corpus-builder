Emmylou Harris,  (born April 2, 1947, Birmingham, Alabama, U.S.), American singer and songwriter who ranged effortlessly among folk, pop, rock, and country-and-western styles, added old-time sensibilities to popular music and sophistication to country music, and established herself as “the queen of country rock.”
After being discovered while singing folk songs in a club, Harris added her satin-smooth country-inflected soprano to former Flying Burrito Brother Gram Parsons’s two solo albums (1973–74), landmarks in country rock. After Parsons’s death, Harris carried his vision forward, first in Pieces of the Sky (1975), which included her tribute to Parsons (“From Boulder to Birmingham”). Following this major-label debut album, she issued a remarkable string of critically acclaimed and commercially successful recordings produced by her husband, Brian Ahern, which included Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town (1978), Roses in the Snow (1980), Cimarron (1981), Last Date (1982), and The Ballad of Sally Rose (1985).
Harris’s collaborations with other prominent artists or covers of their songs were legion and included Simon and Garfunkel, Linda Ronstadt, Hank Williams, the Band, Jule Styne, and Bruce Springsteen. Her 1995 release, Wrecking Ball, on which she performed songs written by Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and Jimi Hendrix, among others, was especially notable and earned the Grammy Award for best contemporary folk album. Red Dirt Girl (2000), on which she was accompanied by such singers as Kate McGarrigle and Dave Matthews, won the same award. Harris joined a host of folk and country artists on the Grammy Award-winning soundtrack for the Coen brothers’ film O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), and she later released the solo efforts Stumble into Grace (2003), All I Intended to Be (2008), and Hard Bargain (2011). She and Rodney Crowell recorded a pair of duet albums: Old Yellow Moon (2013), which took the Grammy for best Americana album, and The Traveling Kind (2015).
In 2008 the Country Music Association inducted Harris into the Country Music Hall of Fame, and in 2018 she received a Grammy lifetime achievement award.
