George Jones, in full George Glenn Jones,  (born September 12, 1931, Saratoga, Texas, U.S.—died April 26, 2013, Nashville, Tennessee), American honky-tonk performer and balladeer considered to be one of the greatest country singers of all time.
Jones’s early work was influenced by Roy Acuff and Hank Williams (both renowned for their genuine, often mournful songs) and the Texas honky-tonk vocal tradition. In 1953 Jones signed with Harold W. (“Pappy”) Daily’s new Starday label in Beaumont, Texas. With Daily as his producer, Jones had a remarkable run of Top Ten hits, such as “The Race Is On” (1964), on the country music charts over the next 15 years. The first to reach number one was “White Lightning” (1959), a raucous novelty song written by his friend the rock-and-roll deejay, songwriter, and recording artist known as the Big Bopper. Other chart-toppers were “Tender Years” (1961) and “She Thinks I Still Care” (1962).
Gradually Jones began to develop a smoother, more romantic and sensitive ballad style. He sang with a number of partners, especially his third wife, country music star Tammy Wynette, whom he married in 1969. In 1970 he moved to Wynette’s producer, Billy Sherrill, at Epic Records. Together and separately the couple, known as the “King and Queen of Country Music,” continued to record hits, including a series of songs that chronicled their stormy relationship (they divorced in 1975): the duets “The Ceremony” (1972), “We’re Gonna Hold On” (1973), “Golden Ring” (1976), and “Two Story House” (1980) and Jones’s “These Days (I Barely Get By)” (1975). His gut-wrenching “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” from the platinum album I Am What I Am, topped the charts and won him a Grammy and other awards in 1980. Jones also recorded with friends such as Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, and Ray Charles, as well as with rock musicians he had influenced, such as Elvis Costello and Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits.
Notwithstanding years of battling alcohol and cocaine abuse—he had become notorious for his drunken rampages and for missing concerts—Jones maintained his loyal following. He recorded more than 100 albums during his career, and more than 150 of his songs were hits. Jones was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1992, and in 2008 he was a recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime achievement.
