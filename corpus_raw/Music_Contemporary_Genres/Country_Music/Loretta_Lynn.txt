Loretta Lynn, née Loretta Webb,  (born April 14, 1932, Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, U.S.), American country music singer who was known as the “Queen of Country.”
Webb was born in a coal miner’s shack. (Although she claimed 1935 as her birth year, various official documents indicate that she was born in 1932.) She married Oliver Lynn in January 1948 and bore the first of six children the next year. In 1960 she released her first single, “Honky Tonk Girl,” which became a hit. In 1962 Lynn joined the Grand Ole Opry, and by the mid-1960s hits such as “Don’t Come Home A-Drinkin’ ” had made her one of country music’s biggest stars. In 1970 she released her signature song, “Coal Miner’s Daughter”; it provided the title of a best-selling autobiography and a popular film (1980).
Lynn retired from the music business in the 1990s but began recording again in 2000. In 2004 she joined forces with Jack White of the alternative rock group the White Stripes to produce the album Van Lear Rose, which garnered two Grammy Awards and a new audience for Lynn. She later recorded Full Circle (2016), an overview of her career that included new songs and remakes of some of her standards. After battling several health issues, including a stroke in 2017, Lynn released the album Wouldn’t It Be Great (2018). Her half sister, Crystal Gayle, also had a successful recording career. In 2013 Lynn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
