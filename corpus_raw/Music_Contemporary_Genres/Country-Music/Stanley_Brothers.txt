Stanley Brothers,  American bluegrass duo. The duo consisted of Ralph (Edmund) Stanley (b. February 25, 1927, Stratton, Virginia, U.S.—d. June 23, 2016, Sandy Ridge, Virginia) on banjo and Carter (Glen) Stanley (b. August 27, 1925, McClure, Virginia—d. December 1, 1966, Bristol, Virginia) on lead guitar. The brothers rose to fame performing traditional religious songs in an Appalachian bluegrass style marked by tight, high-pitched harmonies and strongly influenced by Bill Monroe. With their band, the Clinch Mountain Boys, they had several hit recordings. After Carter’s death, Ralph reorganized the band. He recorded some 185 albums. His career underwent a major resurgence in 2002 when he won a Grammy Award for best male country vocal performance for his a cappella rendering of the song “O Death” from the soundtrack album for the film O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000).  The Stanley Brothers were inducted into the Bluegrass Hall of Fame in 1992.
