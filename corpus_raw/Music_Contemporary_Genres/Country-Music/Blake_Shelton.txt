Blake Shelton, in full Blake Tollison Shelton,  (born June 18, 1976, Ada, Oklahoma, U.S.), American singer-songwriter and television personality who first garnered attention as a popular country musician and then found mainstream success as a coach on the TV series The Voice (2011– ).
Shelton was the son of a used-car dealer and the owner of a beauty salon. He began both performing and songwriting while he was still in high school. At one such performance, he caught the attention of established songwriter Mae Boren Axton, who gave him praise and encouragement. Two weeks after Shelton graduated from high school (1994), he relocated to Nashville, where Axton also lived. She got him a job painting houses and introduced him to people in the music industry. In 1997 Shelton came into contact with songwriter and producer Bobby Braddock, who helped Shelton land a recording contract with Giant Records. In 2001 Shelton recorded the song “Austin,” a love ballad written as a series of answering-machine messages, and Giant released it to country stations. It quickly rose to number one on Billboard’s country singles chart and to 18 on the Hot 100 listing. When Giant Records folded, Warner Brothers picked up Shelton’s contract and in July 2001 released his eponymous debut album; it became the number three country album.
Shelton’s second album, The Dreamer (2003), reached the number two spot on the country chart, and the song “The Baby” was the top country single. The more-assured Blake Shelton’s Barn & Grill (2004) contained the charming and humorous “Some Beach.” Pure BS (2007) spawned the hit country-rock songs “This Can’t Be Good” and “The More I Drink.” Startin’ Fires (2008) included the number one country single “She Wouldn’t Be Gone” as well as “Bare Skin Rug,” a duet sung and cowritten with Shelton’s then girlfriend, Miranda Lambert; the couple married in 2011 and divorced in 2015. In 2010 Shelton released two EPs, Hillbilly Bone and All About Tonight. The rollicking title track of Hillbilly Bone, featuring Trace Adkins, was nominated for a Grammy Award for best country collaboration with vocals.
By 2011 Shelton’s pleasing baritone was a staple on country music radio stations, but he reached a wider audience when The Voice, a reality television show, debuted that fall, with Shelton as one of the four coaches. His next two albums, Red River Blue (2011) and Based on a True Story… (2013), were both nominated for a Grammy for best country album. The songs “Honey Bee” (2011) and “Mine Would Be You” (2013) also received Grammy nods. His popularity continued, with his next three releases—Bringing Back the Sunshine (2014), If I’m Honest (2016), and Texoma Shore (2017)—all topping the country albums chart. In May 2021 he released Body Language, which featured “Happy Anyway,” a duet with pop singer Gwen Stefani, a fellow coach on The Voice whom he began dating in 2015. Shortly after the album’s release, the couple married.
