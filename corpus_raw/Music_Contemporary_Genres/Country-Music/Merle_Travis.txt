Merle Travis, in full Merle Robert Travis,  (born Nov. 29, 1917, Rosewood, Ky., U.S.—died Oct. 20, 1983, Tahlequah, Okla.), American country singer, songwriter, and guitarist who popularized the complex guitar-picking technique now known as the Travis style, or Travis picking, whereby the index finger plays the melody while the thumb plays rhythmic accompaniment. Travis was also a popular singer and writer of hits in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
The son of a Kentucky coal miner, Travis learned the banjo-derived picking style to which he gave his name from Mose Rager and Ike Everly (father of the Everly Brothers). He played with several bands, performed on WLW radio’s Boone County Jamboree, and recorded for King (with Grandpa Jones as the Sheppard Brothers) in Cincinnati, Ohio, before moving to California. There he worked first as a studio musician, then began a solo career in 1946 with a double-sided hit (“Cincinnati Lou” and “No Vacancy”). The next year he began a string of hits (with seven Top Ten songs) that lasted until the early 1950s. He also wrote huge hits for others, notably “Smoke! Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette)” for Tex Williams in 1947 and “Sixteen Tons” for Tennessee Ernie Ford in 1955. A sometime actor, Travis appeared in the film From Here to Eternity (1953). He continued recording with limited success in the 1960s, but in 1974 he and Chet Atkins, whose playing he greatly influenced, won a Grammy for their album The Atkins-Travis Traveling Show. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1977.
