Leonard Chess, orig.Lejzor Czyz,  (born March 12, 1917, Motule, Pol.—died Oct. 16, 1969, Chicago, Ill., U.S.),  Polish-born U.S. record producer. He immigrated to the U.S in 1928 with his mother, sister, and brother—and future partner—Fiszel (later Philip); they joined his father, who had preceded them, in Chicago. After working at several trades, Leonard Chess opened a lounge, and Phil joined him in the business. In 1947 Leonard joined the Aristocrat Record Company; in 1950 he bought the company and, with Phil as partner, renamed it Chess. As fans of the electric blues, a style being heard in Chicago after World War II, they signed such artists as Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Chuck Berry, Howlin’ Wolf, Etta James, Koko Taylor, and Bo Diddley and played a major role in introducing black music to a wider white audience.
