Arthur Crudup,  (born Aug. 24, 1905, Forest, Miss., U.S.—died  March 28, 1974, Nassawadox, Va.),  American blues singer-songwriter. Several of Crudup’s compositions became blues standards, and his song “That’s All Right” was transformed into a rockabilly classic by Elvis Presley at the start of his career.
Crudup moved to Chicago in 1939 and performed for spare change on street corners before becoming a favourite recording artist of the 1940s. He generated infectious charm and energy with his singing. One of the early electric guitarists in blues, Crudup provided himself with simple, rocking accompaniments. Among the songs written by him that became blues standards are “That’s All Right,” “Mean Old Frisco,” “Rock Me Mama,” and “So Glad You’re Mine.” Presley’s recordings of three Crudup songs sold millions of copies, but Crudup was not paid royalties. Disgusted with the recording business, he lived in Mississippi and Virginia and largely abandoned music apart from some blues revival appearances and the recording of at least three albums during a period from the late 1960s until his death.
