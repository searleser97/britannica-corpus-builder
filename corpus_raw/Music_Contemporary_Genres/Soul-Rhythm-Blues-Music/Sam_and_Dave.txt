Sam and Dave,  American vocal duo who were among the most popular performers of soul music in the late 1960s and whose gritty, gospel-drenched style typified the Memphis Sound.
Samuel Moore (b. October 12, 1935, Miami, Florida, U.S.) and David Prater (b. May 9, 1937, Ocilla, Georgia—d. April 9, 1988, near Sycamore, Georgia) were gospel group veterans when they joined forces in Miami in 1961. They recorded for Roulette Records before Atlantic Records producer Jerry Wexler signed them and sent them to Memphis, Tennessee, to record for Stax/Volt Records, for which Atlantic acted as distributor. There, backed by Stax’s extraordinary house band, Sam and Dave became the premier messengers of the songwriting-production duo of Isaac Hayes and David Porter. Among their hits were “You Don’t Know Like I Know” (1965), “Hold On! I’m a Comin’ ” (1966), and the ballad “When Something Is Wrong with My Baby” (1967). “Soul Man,” their biggest hit, reached number two on the pop chart in 1967. Nicknamed “Double Dynamite” as a result of their exciting stage shows, Prater and Moore reputedly came to greatly dislike each other and seldom spoke. They broke up in 1970 but re-formed a number of times in the next 10 years. Prater was killed in a car crash in 1988, four years before Sam and Dave were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Moore continued with a solo career as a performer into the 21st century. In 2019 Sam and Dave received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.
