Little Walter, byname of Marion Walter Jacobs,  (born May 1, 1930, Marksville, Louisiana, U.S.—died February 15, 1968, Chicago, Illinois), American blues singer and harmonica virtuoso who was one of the most influential harmonica improvisers of the late 20th century.
Raised on a Louisiana farm, Little Walter began playing harmonica in childhood, and by the time he was 12 he was playing for a living on New Orleans street corners and in clubs. In his teens he gradually worked northward, settling in Chicago about 1946; there he began recording in 1947 and played in Muddy Waters’s blues band (1948–52).
After Little Walter’s 1952 harmonica solo “Juke” became a popular song, he successfully led his own bands in Chicago and on tours. In the 1960s alcoholism curtailed his career, and he died following a street fight.
Little Walter was one of the major figures in postwar Chicago blues. Influenced by guitarists as well as by senior harmonica players, he brought a singular variety of phrasing to the blues harmonica. His solos were cunningly crafted, alternating riffs and flowing lines. He was a pioneer of playing a harmonica directly into a handheld microphone and developed expressive techniques to enhance his playing. Though his vocal range was small, his singing often emulated Waters’s style. His most popular song was “My Babe,” and his finest work included “Sad Hours,” “Off the Wall,” and “Can’t Hold Out Much Longer.” Little Walter was chosen for the inaugural class (1980) of the Blues Hall of Fame, and in 2008 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
