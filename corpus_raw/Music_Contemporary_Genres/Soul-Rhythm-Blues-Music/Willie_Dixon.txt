Willie Dixon, in full William James Dixon,  (born July 1, 1915, Vicksburg, Mississippi, U.S.—died January 29, 1992, Burbank, California), American blues musician who, as a record producer, bassist, and prolific songwriter, exerted a major influence on the post-World War II Chicago style.
Dixon’s mother wrote religious poetry, and he sang in a gospel quartet before moving to Chicago in 1936. The following year he won the Illinois Golden Glove amateur heavyweight boxing championship. He began playing the double bass in 1939 and worked extensively with the Big Three Trio (1946–52). When that group dissolved, he began working full-time for Chess Records, serving as a house bassist and arranger on recording sessions. Dixon’s upbeat blues compositions, which he sold for as little as $30, helped usher in the Chicago blues sound of the 1950s.
Among his best-known songs were “I’m Your Hoochie Coochie Man” and “I’m Ready,” written for Muddy Waters; “Little Red Rooster” and “Back Door Man,” for Howlin’ Wolf; “My Babe,” for Little Walter; “Bring It on Home,” for the second Sonny Boy Williamson (Alex “Rice” Miller); and “The Seventh Son” and “Wang Dang Doodle.” In the late 1950s he worked with the short-lived Cobra label. In the 1960s he toured Europe with the American Folk Blues Festival and formed the Chicago Blues All-Stars, which traveled widely throughout the United States and Europe. Rock performers such as the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley, and Led Zeppelin recorded his songs.
Dixon was the founder of the Blues Heaven Foundation, a nonprofit organization designed to benefit destitute blues performers and provide scholarships to young musicians. His autobiography is entitled I Am the Blues (1989). Dixon was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1980 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.
