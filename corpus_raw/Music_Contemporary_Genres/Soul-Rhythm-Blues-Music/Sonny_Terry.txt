Sonny Terry, original name Saunders Terrell,  (born October 24, 1911, Greensboro, Georgia, U.S.—died March 11, 1986, Mineola, New York), American blues singer and harmonica player who became the touring and recording partner of guitarist Brownie McGhee in 1941.
Blinded in childhood accidents, Terry was raised by musical parents and developed a harmonica style that imitated sounds ranging from moving trains to barnyard animals, often using his voice while playing these effects. He was influenced by the harmonica player DeFord Bailey, who broadcast nationally on the radio program Grand Ole Opry. Terry traveled as an itinerant musician from 1929 through the 1930s, working with Blind Boy Fuller and recording with him in 1937–40.
Terry first met McGhee in 1939 and in 1940 performed with him and the singer Paul Robeson in Washington, D.C. Terry and McGhee first recorded together in 1941. Subsequently they recorded extensively and toured internationally, becoming a popular nightclub, concert, and folk, blues, and heritage festival attraction. During his long career, Terry also performed and recorded with such bluesmen as Blind Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, and Big Bill Broonzy. Terry appeared in the Broadway musical Finian’s Rainbow (1947–48), the play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955–57), and the film The Color Purple (1985). He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1987.
