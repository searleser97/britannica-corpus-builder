Winthrop Sargeant,  (born Dec. 10, 1903, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.—died  Aug. 15, 1986, Salisbury, Conn.), influential American music critic noted for his fine writing and conservative tastes.
At age 18 Sargeant was the youngest player in the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, and he went on to play with the New York Symphony (1926–28) and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra (1928–30) before abandoning the violin for journalism in 1930. He wrote for Time magazine (1937–45) and then became a senior writer for Life magazine (1945–49). Meanwhile, he wrote Jazz: Hot and Hybrid (1938), the pioneering and highly influential analysis of the sources and structures of the jazz idiom.
It was as a strongly opinionated music critic for The New Yorker (1949–72) that Sargeant exerted his widest influence. He opposed atonality, maintaining that too many modern composers, beginning with the generation of Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky, had rejected the traditions of pre-20th-century music. Instead, he championed such harmonically conservative composers as Carlisle Floyd and Gian Carlo Menotti. Sargeant also wrote enthusiastically about the neglected compositions of Anton Brückner and little-known singers and performers.
Sargeant also interviewed many musicians and nonmusicians. In 1970 his painfully intimate, autobiographical In Spite of Myself was published; it had been written 20 years earlier, after a mental breakdown. A Sanskrit scholar, he translated the Bhagavadgītā (1979).
