Albert Mangelsdorff,  (born September 5, 1928, Frankfurt am Main, Germany—died July 25, 2005, Frankfurt am Main), German trombonist, who began playing bop and in time became an outstanding modal, free jazz, and jazz-rock improviser. He was among the first post-World War II European jazz musicians to create original music.
With his brother Emil (later known as an alto saxophonist), Albert attended secret meetings of the Hot Club of Frankfurt during the period when jazz was banned by the Nazis. He played trombone in a Frankfurt radio band that he led and with German bop groups in the 1950s. Mangelsdorff first played in the United States in 1958. A tour of Asia led to his recording with sitarist Ravi Shankar in 1964 and to his growing involvement with unusual structures, then with free jazz.
As was typical of many free jazz players, Mangelsdorff formed many associations over the years. From 1967 to the 1980s, for example, he was associated with German pianist Alex Schlippenbach’s Globe Unity Orchestra, a touring ensemble of major European free jazz improvisers. He also worked often with pianist Wolfgang Dauner and the United Jazz & Rock Ensemble. Mangelsdorff was most noted for his expressive virtuosity, especially evident in his unaccompanied solos (as in his 1976 Tromboneliness album), which featured long lines in multiphonics (simultaneously played notes). The Albert Mangelsdorff Prize, an annual award offered by the German Jazz Union, was introduced in 1994.
