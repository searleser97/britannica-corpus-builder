Cozy Cole, byname of William Randolph Cole,  (born October 17, 1909, East Orange, New Jersey, U.S.—died January 29, 1981, Columbus, Ohio), American jazz musician who was a versatile percussionist. A highlight of Cole’s drumming career was the 1958 hit “Topsy,” the only recording featuring a drum solo to sell more than one million copies.
After making his recording debut (1930) with Jelly Roll Morton, Cole performed with several major bands, including Stuff Smith’s comedy-jazz group. In 1938 he joined Cab Calloway’s band, and his drumming was featured on “Crescendo in Drums,” “Paradiddle,” and “Ratamacue.” Cole became one of the first African American musicians on a network musical staff when he was hired (1942) by CBS radio to play with Raymond Scott’s orchestra. In the next year he appeared in the Broadway musical Carmen Jones, performing “Beat Out Dat Rhythm on a Drum,” and he later played with the Benny Goodman Quintet in Seven Lively Arts (1945), another musical. From 1949 to 1953 he toured with Louis Armstrong’s All Stars, and in the late 1950s he was a regular at the Metropole Cafe in New York City. In 1962 the U.S. Department of State sent Cole and his band on a tour of Africa. After playing in the quintet of trumpeter Jonah Jones (1969–76), Cole became artist in residence and student lecturer at Capital University in Columbus, Ohio.
