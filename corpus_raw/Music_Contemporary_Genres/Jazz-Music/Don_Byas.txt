Don Byas, byname of Carlos Wesley Byas,  (born October 21, 1912, Muskogee, Oklahoma, U.S.—died August 24, 1972, Amsterdam, Netherlands), American jazz tenor saxophonist whose improvising was an important step in the transition from the late swing to the early bop eras.
During the late 1930s Byas played in several swing bands, including those of Don Redman and Andy Kirk, and in 1941 he became a tenor saxophone soloist with Count Basie on such songs as “Swinging the Blues,” “Royal Garden Blues,” and, most notably, “Harvard Blues.” He also became associated with bebop innovators such as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. In small groups (1943–46) led by himself and others, Byas experimented with the new concepts of bop harmony and rhythm. His 1945 duets with bassist Slam Stewart, “Indiana” and “I Got Rhythm,” show his fluent style with long lines founded in Coleman Hawkins’s rich tone and phrasing but including modern bop harmonic elements.
In 1946, with a Redman band, Byas went to Europe, and he remained there, living in France, the Netherlands, and Denmark for the rest of his life. He continued to pursue a freelance career, touring and recording often, but he revisited the United States only once, for a tour in 1970. Performances such as A Tribute to Cannonball (1961) reveal continuing swing and creative vigour in his later years.
