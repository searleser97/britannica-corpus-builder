Harry Howell Carney,  (born April 1, 1910, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died  Oct. 8, 1974, New York, N.Y.), American musician, featured soloist in Duke Ellington’s band and the first baritone saxophone soloist in jazz.
Carney learned to play the clarinet and alto saxophone from private teachers and worked with local Boston bands until Ellington heard and hired him in 1927. He became Ellington’s companion and driver on cross-country tours and, as a musician, provided a clear tone and big sound that added to the unique blend of Ellington’s saxophone section. Carney’s specialty arrangements included “La Plus Belle Africaine,” “A Chromatic Love Affair,” and “Sophisticated Lady.” Besides recording extensively with Ellington for more than 40 years, Carney recorded with bands led by Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Harry James, and Teddy Wilson. He also recorded with Gerry Mulligan, 17 years his junior and his successor in championing the baritone sax as a jazz instrument.
