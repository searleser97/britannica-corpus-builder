Rhapsody in Blue,  musical composition by George Gershwin, known for its integration of jazz rhythms with classical music, that premiered on February 12, 1924, as part of bandleader Paul Whiteman’s “An Experiment in Modern Music” concert at New York’s Aeolian Concert Hall. The composition, perhaps Gershwin’s most famous, is one of the most performed of all American concert works, and its opening clarinet glissando is one of the most recognized musical passages in the world. United Airlines’s use of the music in its advertisements since the 1980s greatly expanded its global popularity.
Legend has it that Gershwin completely forgot that Whiteman had commissioned a work from him for the upcoming concert in New York. According to the tale, George’s brother Ira, on January 3 or 4, read in a newspaper that Whiteman would soon lead his musicians in a concert of works by Victor Herbert, Irving Berlin, and George Gershwin, the Gershwin piece to be a jazz concerto. When Ira asked his brother about the new piece, George expressed astonishment. He remembered talking with Whiteman about a concerto, but he had not understood that it was expected by Whiteman for performance at that concert. Gershwin had only five weeks left before the premiere.
He began composing the new concerto immediately. Because he needed to travel to Boston for the opening of his newest musical, the main theme of Rhapsody in Blue was actually written on the train from New York. The composer later claimed,
Gershwin worked quickly, sketching out the ensemble parts of the piece at the piano, then handing over the score to Ferde Grofé, Whiteman’s arranger, who orchestrated it. Thanks to their team effort, the band’s parts were ready in time, but the solo piano part was not yet on paper. It existed only in the composer’s mind, and at the first performance Gershwin played it from memory. Regardless, the concert on February 12 was a triumph. An American classic was born.
