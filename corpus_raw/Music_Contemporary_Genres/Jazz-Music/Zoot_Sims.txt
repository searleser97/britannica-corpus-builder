Zoot Sims, byname of John Haley Sims,  (born Oct. 29, 1925, Inglewood, Calif., U.S.—died March 23, 1985, New York, N.Y.), American jazz tenor saxophonist known for his exuberance, mellow tone, and sense of swing.
Born into a family of vaudeville artists, Sims played drums and clarinet from an early age. He began learning tenor saxophone at age 13 and was initially influenced by the cool-toned, swinging style of Lester Young. Within two years Sims was a professional, and he played during his teenage years with several big bands. Working with Ken Baker, Sims got his nickname—others in the band were “Scoot” and “Voot.” In 1943 he began an occasional association with Benny Goodman that would last until 1979.
From 1947 to 1949 Sims was employed in Woody Herman’s Second Herd orchestra. Along with Stan Getz, Herbie Steward (soon replaced by Al Cohn), and Serge Chaloff, Sims was a member of Herman’s renowned “Four Brothers” saxophone section. After leaving Herman, Sims freelanced for most of the rest of his career, recording and touring with such jazz notables as Buddy Rich, Artie Shaw, Stan Kenton, and Gerry Mulligan.
Sims also directed (or codirected with Al Cohn) several small groups throughout his career. He began doubling on soprano saxophone in the 1970s. Highlights of the later part of his career include the albums from 1975 Zoot Sims and the Gershwin Brothers and Basie and Zoot.
