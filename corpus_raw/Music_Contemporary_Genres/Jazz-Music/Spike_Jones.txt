Spike Jones, orig.Lindley Armstrong Jones,  (born Dec. 14, 1911, Long Beach, Calif., U.S.—died May 1, 1965, Los Angeles, Calif.), U.S. bandleader known for his novelty recordings. Jones played drums in radio bands in the late 1930s and soon became known for adding anarchically comical sounds such as car horns, cowbells, and anvils to his percussion. In 1942 he formed Spike Jones and His City Slickers, and the band soon had a hit recording with “Der Fuehrer’s Face.” Jones’s comic hits continued into the 1950s, when he also had his own TV show. Later switching from comedy to Dixieland, the band continued to record into the 1960s.
