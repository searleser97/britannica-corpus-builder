Randy Weston, byname of Randolph E. Weston,  (born April 6, 1926, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died September 1, 2018, Brooklyn), American jazz pianist and composer, noted for his use of African rhythms.
Weston began playing piano in his youth and served in the U.S. Army before beginning a jazz career about age 23. He began leading his own small groups, in nightclubs and concerts, and started recording in the 1950s, when he introduced his best-known compositions, “Hi-Fly” and “Little Niles.” Always interested in African culture, he first traveled to the continent to play in 1961, in Nigeria; after two further journeys to Africa, he settled in Morocco, where he owned a nightclub in 1968–72. His solo piano performance at the 1974 Montreux (Switzerland) Jazz Festival began his steady rise to fame. He subsequently appeared most often as a leader of small groups that he named African Rhythms.
Weston’s piano style was founded on hearty swing and boldly stated melodies. Long rests and spaces in his lines provide room for his rhythm sections to be heard and also help dramatize his rich, blues-based harmonies. To a large extent his style originated in the piano music of Thelonious Monk and Duke Ellington. His groups almost always included one or more hand percussionists, and complex African rhythms are integrated into his music. His repertoire consisted largely of original music; with orchestrator Melba Liston, he also crafted scores for larger jazz ensembles, and his important recordings include 1990 solo piano albums of music by Ellington, Monk, and himself. Weston remained musically active well into his 80s; in 2010 he released The Storyteller, an album recorded live with his African Rhythms Sextet.
