Lee Konitz,  (born October 13, 1927, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died April 15, 2020, New York, New York), American jazz musician, a leading figure in cool jazz and one of the most distinctive alto saxophonists.
Konitz attended Roosevelt University in Chicago and played alto saxophone in the Claude Thornhill band (1947–48), before settling in New York City. Influenced by pianist Lennie Tristano, he developed his mature style and in 1948–50 played in the two seminal cool jazz projects, the Miles Davis “Birth of the Cool” nonet and the Lennie Tristano sextet. After spending a year in the Stan Kenton big band (1952–53), Konitz began a uniquely varied freelance career. He performed often with bop musicians and, in especially rewarding reunions, with Tristano and others of the Tristano circle, such as pianist Sal Mosca and tenor saxophonist Warne Marsh. Apart from appearing in conventional jazz ensembles, he played in duet and solo settings and in his own nonet, which he organized sporadically in the 1970s and 1980s.
Early in his career, Konitz played with an uninflected, vibratoless tone, in contrast to the dominant Charlie Parker alto saxophone style; in time his sound became more expressive without sacrificing its essential clarity. Above all else he was a melodic improviser, who originally played long, often even-noted lines with capricious accents, and who grew steadily to conceive in more varied phrasing. Noted for his frequent harmonic daring, he participated in rare free jazz events, including a free improvisation festival organized by guitarist Derek Bailey in London in 1987. He was an important influence on West Coast alto saxophonists, and he intermittently performed on other woodwinds as well.
