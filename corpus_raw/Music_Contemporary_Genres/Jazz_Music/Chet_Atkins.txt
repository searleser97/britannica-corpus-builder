Chet Atkins, in full Chester Burton Atkins,  (born June 20, 1924, Luttrell, Tennessee, U.S.—died June 30, 2001, Nashville, Tennessee), influential American country-and-western guitarist and record company executive who is often credited with developing the Nashville Sound.
Born into a musical family, Atkins began playing the guitar as a child and during his teen years performed professionally as a fiddler. By the late 1940s he had become a sought-after session guitarist. His signature finger-picking style (three fingers picking the melody while the thumb supplied bass rhythm) was largely derived from that of Merle Travis. From his first solo album, Chet Atkins’ Gallopin’ Guitar (1953), through more than 100 recordings in his own name and hundreds more as a backing musician, Atkins’s picking changed little, although his material and collaborators varied widely. His recordings range from old-time mountain music to contemporary rock and jazz.
Atkins also pursued a parallel career in the music industry as a nonperformer, acting as a talent scout, artists-and-repertoire man, and record producer and serving as vice president of the RCA Corporation (1968–79). In charge of RCA’s Nashville studios from 1957, Atkins helped introduce electric instruments and polished arrangements, broadening the popular appeal of the country music genre. Atkins won many Grammy Awards, and he was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1973.
