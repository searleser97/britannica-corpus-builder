Art Ensemble of Chicago,  American jazz group, innovators of sound, structure, and form in free jazz. They embraced a diversity of African and African American styles and sources in their creation of what they preferred to call “Great Black Music.”
In 1966 composer-woodwind player Roscoe Mitchell (b. August 3, 1940, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.) began forming small Chicago jazz units that he called “art ensembles,” which included bassist Malachi Favors (b. August 22, 1927, Lexington, Mississippi, U.S.—d. January 30, 2004, Chicago, Illinois) and trumpeter Lester Bowie (b. October 11, 1941, Frederick, Maryland, U.S.—d. November 9, 1999, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.). Often they were joined by composer-woodwind player Joseph Jarman (b. September 14, 1937, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, U.S.—d. January 9, 2019, Englewood, New Jersey, U.S.), who became a permanent member of the Art Ensemble in 1968, turning it into a cooperative quartet. Their international fame began in 1969–71, when they recorded and toured prolifically in Europe and added a percussionist, Don Moye (b. May 23, 1946, Rochester, New York, U.S.). Subsequently they toured almost annually as a quintet in Europe, Japan, and the United States.
At a time when the dominant trend in free jazz was intense, loud, very fast music, the Art Ensemble by contrast began featuring group and solo improvising in a wide range of freely changing tempos, dynamics, and textures. Its members played many instruments; their virtuosity included mastery of their instruments’ overtone and multiphonics ranges, and Bowie became especially noted for his expressive concepts. They all played percussion instruments, including bells, gourds, and gongs, and the addition of Moye broadened their use of exotic percussion. While the Art Ensemble incorporated traditional jazz, classical, and popular works, music composed by its members was the source of its improvising in recordings such as A Jackson in Your House (1969), People in Sorrow (1969), Bap-Tizum (1972), and Urban Bushmen (1980).
The five musicians also pursued independent careers; Bowie, for example, was a featured soloist with his Brass Fantasy band and the New York Organ Ensemble, and Mitchell composed extended works such as Nonaah (1976–77) and The Maze (1978).
In 1993 Jarman left the group to pursue his interests in Buddhism and aikido, and the ensemble continued as a quartet. Bowie’s death in 1999 left them as a trio, and they recorded Tribute to Lester (2003). Jarman’s return in 2003 led to The Meeting (2003). Sirius Calling (2004) was the final album before Favors’s death. The acclaimed Non-Cognitive Aspects of the City: Live at Iridium (2006) was recorded with trumpeter Corey Wilkes and bassist Jaribu Shahid. The Art Ensemble of Chicago celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017 with a series of concerts and the retrospective double album We Are on the Edge (2019).
