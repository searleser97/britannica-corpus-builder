Wild Bill Davison, byname of William Edward Davison,  (born Jan. 5, 1906, Defiance, Ohio, U.S.—died  Nov. 14, 1989, Santa Barbara, Calif.), American jazz cornet player who recorded some 800 songs and traveled extensively in his 70-year career.
After playing in Ohio with the Ohio Lucky Seven, Davison moved to Chicago in the late 1920s and performed in legendary gangster-run nightclubs. He worked with clarinettist Frank Teschemacher and was driving the car in which Teschemacher was killed in 1932. For the next several years, he worked in Milwaukee, Wis., before becoming a regular at Eddie Condon’s club in New York City, where he performed from 1945 to 1957. Davison played with over 100 bands and made more than 20 albums between 1965 and 1975. During his later years, he fronted his own band and toured often in the United States and in Europe.
