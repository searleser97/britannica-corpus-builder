Bennie Moten,  (born November 13, 1894, Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.—died April 2, 1935, Kansas City), American pianist, one of the earliest known organizers of bands in the Midwest in the emergent years of jazz.
Moten became a bandleader in and around his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri, in 1922 and remained so until his death. His recording debut was in 1923, and his early recordings are unremarkable. However, by 1931 he had absorbed into his orchestra most of the members of Walter Page’s Blue Devils, and his 1932 recording session, which included the songs “Toby” and “Moten Swing,” exemplified Kansas City orchestral jazz. Moten is regarded as a figure of great importance in the development of the larger jazz orchestra, his achievement being verified when, after his untimely death in 1935, the remnants of his group were taken up by his second pianist, Count Basie, and fashioned into a new, far more streamlined orchestra destined to become one of the outstanding orchestras in jazz history.
