Nat Adderley, in full Nathaniel Adderley,  (born November 25, 1931, Tampa, Florida, U.S.—died January 2, 2000, Lakeland, Florida), American cornetist and songwriter who starred in the popular “soul jazz” quintet headed (1959–75) by his older brother, Cannonball Adderley.
Although he began playing the trumpet in his teens, Nat Adderley switched in 1950 to the somewhat smaller cornet, playing it in the U.S. Army band led by his brother. After a year with Lionel Hampton’s big band (1954–55), he played in Cannonball’s first quintet (1956–57), then toured widely with J.J. Johnson’s group and the Woody Herman band. Formed at the height of the popularity of hard bop (which evolved from and incorporated elements of gospel music and rhythm and blues), Cannonball’s second quintet, the Cannonball Adderley Quintet, was a success from the beginning. It highlighted and contrasted Nat’s warm, lyric improvising with his brother’s flaring alto saxophone solos. Meanwhile, Nat introduced his best-known tune, “Work Song,” on one of his own albums in 1960; the song soon became a standard. Nat’s blues-drenched songs, such as “Jive Samba” and “Sermonette,” also became hits for Cannonball’s group. The brothers collaborated on a musical about John Henry, the mythical African American railroad man; it was originally recorded as Big Man (1975) and staged as Shout Up a Morning (1986).
After Cannonball’s death in 1975, Nat temporarily retired, but from 1976 he led his own groups, which usually included a Cannonball-styled altoist. A favourite of audiences, in part for his good-humoured presentation, and of fellow musicians, Nat played on nearly 100 albums as a leader and sideman. Diabetes led in 1997 to the amputation of a leg, which effectively ended his career.
