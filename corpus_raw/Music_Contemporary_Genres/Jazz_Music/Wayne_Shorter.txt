Wayne Shorter,  (born August 25, 1933, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.), American musician and composer, a major jazz saxophonist, among the most influential hard-bop and modal musicians and a pioneer of jazz-rock fusion music.
Shorter studied at New York University (B.M.E., 1956) and served in the U.S. Army (1956–58). He spent brief periods in the Horace Silver quintet (1956) and the Maynard Ferguson big band (1958) before his first major association, with Art Blakey’s hard-bop Jazz Messengers (1959–63). He joined Miles Davis’s modal jazz quintet as a tenor saxophonist in 1964 and stayed with him during Davis’s early fusion music experiments, leaving in 1970 as a soprano saxophonist.
Throughout the 1970s and much of the ’80s, Shorter and keyboard player Joe Zawinul together led Weather Report, a fusion band that explored an uncommon variety of sound colours. He returned frequently to the tenor saxophone and in later years led his own fusion music groups.
Shorter’s improvising was always notable for its great harmonic and rhythmic sophistication. His early tenor saxophone solos, inspired by Sonny Rollins, featured rare formal unity using thematic improvisation techniques, often with drama and humour (“Afrique,” “High Modes”). A growing concern with lyricism resulted in considerable stylistic revision and the use of more diffuse forms by the mid-1960s; much of his playing suggested a reinterpretation of John Coltrane’s style. His early soprano saxophone work, including the Super Nova album (1969), is especially notable for its melodic flow. A prolific composer, Shorter wrote many of his finest songs for the Blakey and Davis groups, including “Lester Left Town,” “Ping Pong,” “Children of the Night,” and “Footprints.”
Shorter continued to perform into the early 21st century, and his later albums included Atlantis (1985), High Life (1995), Without a Net (2013), and Emanon (2018); the last two were among several that featured the quartet of Shorter, Danilo Pérez (piano), John Patitucci (bass), and Brian Blade (drums). Shorter received more than 10 Grammy Awards, including a lifetime achievement award in 2015. He was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1998 and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2018.
