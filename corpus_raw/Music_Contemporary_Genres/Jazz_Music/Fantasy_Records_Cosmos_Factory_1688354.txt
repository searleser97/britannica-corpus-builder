Fantasy was founded as a jazz label in San Francisco in 1949 by brothers Sol and Max Weiss. Their artists included the pianist Dave Brubeck (whose Jazz at Oberlin was among the first live jazz albums) and controversial comedian Lenny Bruce.  After organizing a buyout in 1967, the label’s new owner Saul Zaentz relocated it to Oakland and committed the company’s resources to promoting Creedence Clearwater Revival,  a group led by a young man who worked in the firm’s stock room.
Nominally a four-piece band, Creedence was effectively a vehicle for the songs, sounds, and obsessions of writer-guitarist John Fogerty, whose raw, powerful voice and economical arrangements contrasted vividly with the indulgences being encouraged across the Bay. Fogerty’s records with Creedence distilled the essence of 1950s rock and roll and flavoured it with the rhythm of ’60s Memphis soul. The group had seven Top Five hits in two years (1969–70).  But idealistic notions of a symbiotic partnership between a visionary artist and a resourceful independent label were eventually dashed by recriminatory lawsuits between Fogerty and Zaentz.
Moving to Berkeley in 1970, Zaentz later bought out several catalogs—including those of Stax and Specialty—and several jazz labels while diversifying into film production. He won Academy Awards for best picture for  One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) and The English Patient (1997).
