Herbie Nichols, byname of Herbert Horatio Nichols,  (born January 3, 1919, New York City, New York, U.S.—died  April 12, 1963, New York City), American jazz pianist and composer whose advanced bop-era concepts of rhythm, harmony, and form predicted aspects of free jazz.
Nichols attended the City College of New York and served in the U.S. Army in 1941–43. He participated in the Harlem sessions that led to the development of bop, and Billie Holiday wrote lyrics to his song “Lady Sings the Blues.” Most of his career, however, he spent playing in Dixieland and swing groups or accompanying singers and nightclub acts, only occasionally working with stylistic contemporaries or performing his original music publicly. He composed about 170 songs, and in 1955–57 he recorded the four albums upon which his reputation is largely based—The Prophetic Herbie Nichols, Vol. 2 (1955), The Third World (1956), Herbie Nichols Trio (1956), and Love, Gloom, Cash, Love (1957). After his death, from leukemia, most of his unrecorded compositions were destroyed in an apartment flood; however, unissued recordings by Nichols, including eight “new” songs, were discovered and released in the 1980s.
As a pianist Nichols was at his best interpreting his own compositions; he also was his own best interpreter. Like early jazz composers, Nichols created portraits (“117th Street,” “Dance Line”) and dramas (“Love, Gloom, Cash, Love,” “The Spinning Song”) in his themes. The harmonic foundations of his songs were original and often daring; his structures frequently extended song form far beyond the customary four strain, 32 measure limits. His solos, which were variations on his themes, incorporated rhythmic displacements and reharmonizations and created open spaces in his melodic lines that inspired interplay with his drummers. The generous strain of humour in his work belied the difficulties he experienced in his career.
