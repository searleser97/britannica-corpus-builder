Eddie Lang, byname Blind Willie Dunn,  original name Salvatore Massaro,  (born Oct. 25, 1902, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  March 26, 1933, New York, N.Y.), American musician, among the first guitar soloists in jazz and an accompanist of rare sensitivity.
Lang began playing violin in boyhood; his father, who made fretted stringed instruments, taught him to play guitar. In the early 1920s he played with former schoolmate Joe Venuti in Atlantic City, N.J., and then toured with the Mound City Blue Blowers. He settled in New York City in 1924, where he played in dance bands. He quickly became a favourite in studios, making noted recordings with Frank Trumbauer and Bix Beiderbecke (including “Singin’ the Blues,” 1927), among others. Under the pseudonym Blind Willie Dunn, Lang played accompaniments to blues singers and guitar duets with Lonnie Johnson, and he led the band Gin Bottle Four, which included Johnson and King Oliver (“Jet Black Blues,” 1929).
Lang was perhaps most noted for his many recordings with Venuti (including “Stringing the Blues,” 1926) and for his guitar solo recordings. His technique was brilliant, and he was the most important of early jazz stylists to play single-string solos on guitar. His association with the Paul Whiteman band (1929–30) led to work as the guitar accompanist to Bing Crosby early in the singer’s solo career. Lang’s untimely death resulted from complications following a tonsillectomy.
