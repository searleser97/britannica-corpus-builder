Elvin Jones, in full Elvin Ray Jones,  (born September 9, 1927, Pontiac, Michigan, U.S.—died May 18, 2004, Englewood, New Jersey), American jazz drummer and bandleader who established a forceful polyrhythmic approach to the traps set, combining different metres played independently by the hands and feet into a propulsive flow of irregularly shifting accents.
Jones was mostly self-taught, though he came of a musical family that included siblings Hank and Thad, jazz pianist and trumpeter, respectively. Jones played drums in school and army bands before beginning his professional career in Detroit in 1949. In 1956 he moved to New York City, where he performed with Donald Byrd, Pepper Adams, and others, and in 1960 he joined saxophonist John Coltrane’s quartet with McCoy Tyner, pianist, and Jimmy Garrison, bassist. The highly acclaimed group became one of the most influential jazz combos of the 1960s. During this time Jones perfected his powerful polyrhythmic style, recording a series of albums with Coltrane that influenced jazz substantially, including My Favorite Things (1960) and A Love Supreme (1964). Rather than merely keeping time, the drummer, through Jones’s example, became an improviser of equal importance to the lead melodic instrumentalist. After the addition of a second drummer, Rashied Ali, to the Coltrane group, Jones left in 1966 to lead his own small bands, featuring such saxophonists as Joe Farrell, Frank Foster, Dave Liebman, and Pat LaBarbera. Jones’s recordings include The Ultimate Elvin Jones (1968) and It Don’t Mean a Thing (1993).
