Dexter Gordon, in full Dexter Keith Gordon,  (born Feb. 27, 1923, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.—died  April 25, 1990, Philadelphia, Pa.), American bop tenor saxophonist.
As a youth Gordon played the clarinet and alto saxophone, but the improvising of Lester Young inspired him to play the tenor saxophone exclusively. He gained early experience in bands led by Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, Billy Eckstine, and alto saxophonist Charlie Parker, who also influenced Gordon’s music. A big-toned, exultant, lyrical soloist, he became known for epic mock-battles with fellow tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray during the late 1940s. While serving a prison term for narcotics-related charges he made his acting debut in the film Unchained (1955).
After his release he composed for and played and acted in a Los Angeles production of Jack Gelber’s play The Connection (1960) in the early 1960s and recorded albums such as Go! and A Swingin’ Affair that are usually considered his major works. He then lived in Europe (1962–76), recording and touring frequently, though rarely to America. His acting role as a self-destructive bebop saxophonist in the 1986 film Round Midnight won him an Academy Award nomination; he also appeared in the film Awakenings (1990).
