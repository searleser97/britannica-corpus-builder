Gunther Schuller,  (born November 22, 1925, New York, New York, U.S.—died June 21, 2015, Boston, Massachusetts), American composer, performer, conductor, teacher, and writer noted for his wide range of activity in both jazz and classical music and for his works embracing both jazz and advanced 12-tone elements.
Schuller was born into a family of musicians. His grandfather was a conductor in Germany, and his father was a violinist with the New York Philharmonic for 41 years. Schuller, whose early education was in specialized music schools, began playing the French horn with the New York Philharmonic at age 15 and became principal hornist at the Cincinnati (Ohio) Symphony (1943) and Metropolitan Opera (1945) orchestras. His interest in jazz developed early when he became a fan of Duke Ellington; he made symphonic adaptations of several Ellington pieces and in 1955 composed Symphonic Tribute to Duke Ellington. He often collaborated with John Lewis, notably with the Modern Jazz Quartet and the Modern Jazz Society.
As a composer, Schuller began in the path of Anton Webern (known for writing concise 12-tone compositions), as illustrated by the Cello Concerto (1945). Later he used unusual combinations of instruments in chamber music such as the Fantasia concertante (1947) in versions for three oboes or three trombones and piano and the Quartet for four double basses (1947). By 1955 Schuller was well along in combining elements from disparate musical styles in works such as his Twelve by Eleven, for chamber orchestra with jazz improvisation. By 1957 he had coined the term third stream to describe the confluence of jazz and classical techniques. Many of his other compositions fused jazz elements with classical forms.
Other notable works by Schuller are Spectra (1958, first performed 1960), for sextuple orchestra; 7 Studies of Paul Klee (1959); Variants (1960), music for a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine; The Fisherman and His Wife (1970), an opera for children, with a libretto written by John Updike; Deaï (1978), written for two orchestras and symbolizing the merging of East and West; and Concerto for Contrabassoon (1978), the first concerto ever written for that instrument. His later works include Of Reminiscences and Reflections for orchestra (1993; Pulitzer Prize, 1994); The Black Warrior (1998), an oratorio based on Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “Letter from the Birmingham Jail”; and Refrains (2006), for 12 tubas, 10 euphoniums, and percussion.
Schuller taught at the Yale School of Music (1964–67) and was president of the New England Conservatory of music (1967–77). For 20 years he was affiliated with the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts. He also worked as a guest conductor or as conductor in residence for several orchestras and music festivals. In addition, Schuller formed the New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble, whose recording The Red Back Book, consisting of works of Scott Joplin, became a best seller and won a Grammy Award in 1973.
Schuller authored educational works such as Horn Technique, 2nd ed. (1992), and The Compleat Conductor (1997). He was also a leading scholar of jazz, and Early Jazz: Its Roots and Musical Development (1968, reissued 1986) and The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930–1945 (1989) are well-regarded histories. He also wrote the current Britannica article on jazz.
Schuller was awarded a Jazz Masters fellowship for advocacy in 2008 and received the 2015 Edward MacDowell Medal for outstanding contributions in his field.
