Fats Navarro, byname of Theodore Navarro,  (born September 24, 1923, Key West, Florida, U.S.—died  July 7, 1950, New York, New York), American jazz trumpet virtuoso, one of the founders of bebop, who was distinguished by the beauty and fertility of his melodic creations.
Navarro first performed as a tenor saxophonist in Miami, Florida, and went on to play trumpet in big bands, most notably Andy Kirk’s (1943–44) and the avant-garde Billy Eckstine band of 1945–46. He then worked and recorded with other well-known leaders, including Illinois Jacquet and Coleman Hawkins, before making the most important association of his career with composer-bandleader Tadd Dameron in 1948–49. By then, however, Navarro’s heroin addiction had made him undependable; in his last year, as he grew progressively more ill from tuberculosis, he performed less often.
To a large extent Navarro’s improvising was influenced by Dizzy Gillespie, though Navarro was the more fluent player, capable of subtle dynamic shadings. The fullness and vitality of Navarro’s tone extended through all ranges of his trumpet, and he executed complex phrases with rare grace. The variety of his phrasing added to the exuberant quality of his music, yet his solos were also notable for their organization. Apart from his works with Dameron, such as “Symphonette” and “Our Delight,” his most notable recordings included “Nostalgia,” “Ice Freezes Red,” and “Fat Girl”; the 1949 Bud Powell quintet session that produced “Dance of the Infidels” and “Bouncing with Bud”; and broadcast recordings with Charlie Parker, among which were ““Ornithology”” and “The Street Beat.”
