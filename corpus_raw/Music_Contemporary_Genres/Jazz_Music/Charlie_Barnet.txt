Charlie Barnet, byname of Charles Daly Barnet,  (born October 26, 1913, New York, New York, U.S.—died September 4, 1991, San Diego, California), American band leader and saxophonist of the swing jazz era.
Born into a wealthy family, Barnet rejected their urging that he become a corporate lawyer and instead turned to music. He led his first band at age 16, on a transatlantic liner, and eventually made 22 such crossings; he also visited the South Seas and Latin America. In 1932 he became leader of the band at the Paramount Hotel in Manhattan, New York City, and thereafter formed a succession of large and small bands. He achieved his greatest fame with the recording of “Cherokee” (1939), his signature song, and with “Skyliner” (1944).
Barnet, who was nicknamed “Mad Mab,” was one of the big band era’s most colourful figures; he was said to have been married at least 6 times (some sources say as many as 11 times). He was also one of the first white leaders to feature Black performers, among them Lena Horne, Roy Eldridge, Charlie Shavers, Benny Carter, and Frankie Newton. He was especially influenced by the style of the Duke Ellington orchestra. Barnet and his various ensembles appeared in such motion pictures as Syncopation (1942), The Fabulous Dorseys (1947), and Make Believe Ballroom (1949).
In later years, after the demise of the big bands, Barnet variously tried such careers as music publishing and the restaurant business but nevertheless continued to play occasionally. His autobiography, Those Swinging Years (1984), illuminated the jazz musician’s hectic life on the road.
