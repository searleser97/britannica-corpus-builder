Kansas City style,   music associated with jazz musicians who, though not all born there, were based around Kansas City, Mo., during the 1930s: pianists Pete Johnson and Mary Lou Williams; singer Big Joe Turner; trumpeter Oran “Hot Lips” Page; saxophonists Buster Smith, Ben Webster, and Lester Young; bassist-bandleader Walter Page; saxophonist-bandleader Andy Kirk; and pianist-bandleaders Bennie Moten, Jay McShann, and Count Basie.
Prominent characteristics of Kansas City style were the loose and relaxed rhythmic feeling (less stiff than Chicago and New York City counterparts) and a simplicity of arrangement that often took the form of syncopated, repeating phrases, called riffs, that were played by one section of the band antiphonally against another (saxes versus brass, for example). Saxophonists preferred a tone that was drier and had slower vibrato than was common on the East Coast.
The style received national attention when Count Basie broadcast and then toured with a band he formed from the remnants of Walter Page’s Blue Devils and the Bennie Moten band. This was the Kansas City sound with Lester Young as star soloist. Then, under the influence of Buster Smith, a highly respected saxophonist and teacher, saxophonist Charlie Parker developed and was heard soloing with the Jay McShann band, before he helped to launch the modern jazz style known as bebop.
Though usually thought of as principally a swing era big band style because of the bands led by Andy Kirk, Jay McShann, and Count Basie, Kansas City jazz from the 1920s to the ’40s developed much as it did in New York City and Chicago: first with New Orleans style combos, then larger combos (adding written and more elaborate arrangements), and finally culminating with the instrumentation of the swing era big band. Extended discussion, including speculation on the political and economic factors contributing to a fertile entertainment scene in 1930s Kansas City, is provided by Ross Russell’s Jazz Style in Kansas City and the Southwest (1971) and in Leroy Ostransky’s Jazz City (1978).
