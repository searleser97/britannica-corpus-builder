National Public Radio (NPR),  the public radio network of the United States. Based in Washington, D.C., NPR offers a broad range of high-quality news and cultural programming to hundreds of local public radio stations.
The 1967 Public Broadcasting Act created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which in 1970 established NPR to provide programming to the nation’s noncommercial and educational radio stations, most of them situated at the low end of the FM radio dial. NPR broadcast its first program—live coverage of U.S. Senate deliberations on the Vietnam War—on April 19, 1971. Two weeks later NPR’s daily evening news program All Things Considered was first broadcast; in 1979 it was joined by Morning Edition. During the early 1980s NPR broadcast original plays and adaptations of classic novels, jazz concerts and festivals, and classical music. Confronted with a $7 million debt in 1983, however, NPR abandoned virtually all of its nonnews programming. A financial restructuring in 1983 resulted in the direct allocation of CPB grants to NPR member stations, which used the money to pay for network programs. Gifts and grants from foundations, corporations, and individuals, together with member station fees and dues, provide essential funding for NPR.
Besides All Things Considered and Morning Edition, NPR’s most popular offerings have included Fresh Air (begun 1975), an interview program hosted by Terry Gross; Talk of the Nation (1991–2013), an interview and listener call-in program; and the weekly Car Talk (1977–2012). The network also syndicated such programs as NPR Playhouse (1981–2002), the environmentally focused Living on Earth (begun 1991), Latino USA (begun 1992), On the Media (begun 1995), and the current-events quiz show Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me! (begun 1998). Music programs have included Piano Jazz (1979–2011), which was hosted for many years by Marian McPartland; The Thistle & Shamrock (begun 1981); and Afropop Worldwide (begun 1988 as Afropop). NPR also provides live coverage of significant news events, including major congressional hearings or presidential addresses. In 1993 NPR began broadcasting overseas via satellite.
Separate public radio networks such as Pacifica, Public Radio International (PRI), and American Public Media also distribute programming to public radio stations.
