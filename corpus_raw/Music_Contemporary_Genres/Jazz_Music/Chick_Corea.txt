Chick Corea, byname of Armando Anthony Corea,  (born June 12, 1941, Chelsea, Massachusetts, U.S.—died February 9, 2021), classically trained American jazz pianist, composer, and bandleader whose piano style and tunes were extensively imitated.
During the mid-1960s Corea played with Blue Mitchell, Willie Bobo, Cal Tjader, and Herbie Mann and in the late 1960s with Stan Getz and Miles Davis. Corea led his own groups called Circle and Return to Forever during the 1970s. With a piano style developed from those of Bill Evans, Horace Silver, and McCoy Tyner (with a touch of Paul Hindemith), he became the principal model for most young jazz pianists of the 1970s. The interval of a fourth is prominent in his left-hand figures. A Spanish flavour is common in much of his composing and improvising, the pieces “Spain” and “La Fiesta” being especially popular. His “Windows” became a jazz standard.
Combining his light, playful melodies with the use of synthesizers and numerous electric keyboard instruments plus the incorporation of rock and Spanish rhythms, Corea appealed to an audience beyond the boundaries of the jazz market. In the 21st century he continued to expand his stable of musical partnerships, collaborating with banjo virtuoso Béla Fleck and recruiting Bobby McFerrin to provide scat backing to Corea classics. Additionally, he reunited with Return to Forever, ending a hiatus for the band that had lasted more than two decades. Hot House (2012), one of several albums since the 1970s that paired him with vibraphonist Gary Burton, earned Corea his 20th Grammy Award. He won another Grammy for Antidote (2019), which he recorded with his Spanish Heart Band. He also received multiple Latin Grammy Awards.
