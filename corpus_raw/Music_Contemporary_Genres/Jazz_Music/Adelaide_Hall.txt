Adelaide Hall,  (born October 20, 1901, New York, New York, U.S.—died November 7, 1993, London, England), American-born jazz improviser whose wordless rhythm vocalizing ushered in what became known as scat singing.
The daughter of a music teacher, Hall attended the Pratt Institute in New York City. In 1921 she made her professional debut as a chorus member in the benchmark revue Shuffle Along at the 63rd Street Theatre. Featuring Florence Mills, Josephine Baker, and Paul Robeson, the musical helped establish African American show business. Hall later appeared in Runnin’ Wild before launching a 1926 European tour as the star of Chocolate Kiddies. After returning to the United States, Hall toured in vaudeville and appeared on Broadway in Desires of 1927, Town Topics, Blackbirds of 1928, and Brown Buddies. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1957–59 in Jamaica. She also contributed her pioneering vocals to Duke Ellington’s classic recording “Creole Love Call” (1927).
In 1934 Hall and her husband, Wilbur Hicks, took up permanent residence in Europe, opening nightclubs in Paris and London, where they eventually settled. A major star abroad, she achieved that status in the United States only after her appearance in the 1979 concert Black Broadway, 1900–1945, which was coproduced by Bobby Short; the performance took place at Avery Fisher Hall in New York City and was part of the Newport Jazz Festival . She also staged a one-woman show at Carnegie Hall in 1988. Hall, who continued to perform into her 90s, was the subject of a television film, Sophisticated Lady (1989), and later her story was recounted on radio in a program entitled Sweet Adelaide.
