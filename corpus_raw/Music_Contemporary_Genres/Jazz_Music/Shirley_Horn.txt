Shirley Horn, in full Shirley Valerie Horn,  (born May 1, 1934, Washington, D.C., U.S.—died Oct. 20, 2005, Cheverly, Md.), American jazz artist whose ballads, sung in a breathy contralto to her own piano accompaniment, earned her both critical acclaim and popular renown.
Horn was raised in Washington, D.C., and attended the Junior School of Music at Howard University, where she studied classical piano. She sang in local jazz bars and rose to prominence when Miles Davis asked her to open for his act after listening to her first album, Embers and Ashes (1960). She recorded five albums in the 1960s, including several with producer Quincy Jones, while performing in jazz clubs in New York and in Europe. Upon the birth of her daughter, Horn settled in Washington, D.C., to concentrate on raising her family, performing only occasionally at local venues.
Horn returned to a more regular performing schedule with the release of her 1978 album, A Lazy Afternoon. She became popular through a series of albums released by Verve Records, including You Won’t Forget Me (1990), in which she was joined by trumpeters Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis, and Here’s to Life (1992). In 1998 she won a Grammy Award for I Remember Miles. Her later albums include You’re My Thrill (2001) and May the Music Never End (2003).
