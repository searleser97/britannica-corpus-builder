LaVern Baker, byname of Delores Williams,  (born Nov. 11, 1929, Chicago, Ill., U.S.—died March 10, 1997, New York, N.Y.), American rhythm-and-blues singer notable for her vocal power and rhythmic energy.
At age 17 she performed as Little Miss Sharecropper. Her 1955–65 tenure with Atlantic Records yielded 15 rhythm-and-blues hits, most notably “Tweedle Dee” (1955), “Jim Dandy” (1957), and “I Cried a Tear” (1959). Popular imitations of her recordings by white singers in the mid-1950s temporarily slowed her career. Typically her hits were novelty songs, but her only jazz album, LaVern Baker Sings Bessie Smith (1958), revealed her mastery of drama, expression, and soul. She retired to the Philippines in the 1970s and ’80s and returned to performing in concerts and clubs in the United States in the 1990s.
