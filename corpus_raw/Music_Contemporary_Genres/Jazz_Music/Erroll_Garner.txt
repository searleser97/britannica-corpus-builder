Erroll Garner, in full Erroll Louis Garner,  (born June 15, 1921, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died January 2, 1977, Los Angeles, California), American pianist and composer, one of the most virtuosic and popular pianists in jazz.
Garner was influenced by Fats Waller and was entirely self-taught. He substituted for Art Tatum in the latter’s trio in 1945 and subsequently formed his own three-piece group, achieving commercial success with Concert by the Sea (1958), one of the best-selling albums in jazz. Like Waller and Tatum, Garner was adept at performing both with a rhythm section and unaccompanied, often establishing great momentum with his sure sense of swing. His best-known composition is “Misty.”
