Kenny Clarke, byname of Kenneth Spearman Clarke,  also called Klook,  (born Jan. 9, 1914, Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S.—died  Jan. 25, 1985, Montreuil-sous-Bois, near Paris, Fr.), American drummer who was a major exponent of the modern jazz movement of the 1940s.
Clarke’s music studies in high school embraced vibraphone, piano, trombone, and theory, but it was as a drummer that he began his professional career in 1930. His experience included engagements with Roy Eldridge, Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins, Ella Fitzgerald, Benny Carter, and Henry Allen. In 1939 he joined Teddy Hill’s band, at that time a refuge for several embryo modernists, and in 1946 he formed an association with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. In April 1952 he helped found the Modern Jazz Quartet but left before the group became popular. He settled in France in 1956 and was coleader there of the Kenny Clarke–Francy Boland Band from 1960 until its dissolution in 1973.
Clarke was a chief element in the modernist movement in the 1940s, revolutionizing the drummer’s role by moving the principal timekeeping rhythms to the ride cymbal and by interjecting musical comments to the soloist by “dropping bombs” on the bass drum and snare drum with unexpected fills and underscorings.
