The Jam,  British rock group that emerged at the height of the punk rock movement but whose sound and image were greatly influenced by the British mod bands of the early 1960s. The principal members were Paul Weller (b. May 25, 1958, Woking, Surrey, Eng.), Rick Buckler (b. Dec. 6, 1955, Woking), and Bruce Foxton (b. Sept. 1, 1955, England).
Formed in 1973 in Woking, near London, the Jam gained popularity on the English club circuit. Their energetic shows and sound drew comparisons with the early Who, and that band’s influence is evident in the Jam’s first album, In the City (1977), which solidified the group’s guitar-bass-drums lineup. Later records, particularly All Mod Cons (1978) and Setting Sons (1979), reflected more influences, which eventually included those of the Kinks, the Beatles, Motown, and soul. Those albums also showcased the band’s growing social awareness, with politically charged songs such as “Down in the Tube Station at Midnight,” about xenophobic violence, and “Eton Rifles,” steeped in class conflict. Always a peculiarly English band in both their outlook and their lyrics, the Jam never gained international popularity to match their success in the United Kingdom, where they were huge stars and where songwriter and driving force Weller was, for a time, regarded as a spokesman for his generation. The Jam broke up in 1982 as Weller went on to form the Style Council and later embarked on a solo career.
