Bob Seger, byname of Robert Clark Seger,  (born May 6, 1945, Dearborn, Michigan, U.S.), American singer, songwriter, and guitarist who achieved great popularity in the 1970s and ’80s with an earthy sound and lyrical themes rooted in the American Midwest.
One of the Midwest’s most successful rock performers, Seger was musically influenced by soul and rhythm and blues that were created in his native Detroit, while his lyrics were largely inspired by the ups and downs in the lives of the working class in the American heartland. After playing with several bands as a teenager, Seger began releasing records under his own name in 1966, but for a number of years he failed to make an impression beyond the Detroit area. In 1974 he assembled the Silver Bullet Band, which would be his backing group for decades to come. On tour they quickly built a national following, which was soon reflected in Seger’s record sales, with Live Bullet (1976) staying on the Billboard charts for more than three years and commencing a string of seven consecutive Top Ten albums, including Night Moves (1976), Against the Wind (1980), and Like a Rock (1986).
In the 1980s the membership of the Silver Bullet Band began shifting, and Seger reduced his touring and recording profile, releasing only two albums in the 1990s. In 2004 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and followed with a new album, Face the Promise, in 2006, after which he returned to touring. He later released Ride Out (2014) and I Knew You When (2017). In 2018 Seger launched his farewell tour, and his last concert was held the following year. Even after his public activity had decreased, his music continued to be strongly associated with Midwestern working-class values, leading automobile maker General Motors to feature Seger’s “Like a Rock” in a prominent and long-running advertising campaign for Chevrolet.
