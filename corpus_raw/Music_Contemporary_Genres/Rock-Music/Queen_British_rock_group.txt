Queen,  British rock band whose fusion of heavy metal, glam rock, and camp theatrics made it one of the most popular groups of the 1970s. Although generally dismissed by critics, Queen crafted an elaborate blend of layered guitar work by virtuoso Brian May and overdubbed vocal harmonies enlivened by the flamboyant performance of front man and principal songwriter Freddie Mercury. The members were Freddie Mercury (original name Farrokh Bulsara; b. September 5, 1946, Stone Town, Zanzibar [now in Tanzania]—d. November 24, 1991, Kensington, London, England), Brian May (b. July 19, 1947, Twickenham, Middlesex, England), John Deacon (b. August 19, 1951, Leicester, Leicestershire, England), and Roger Taylor (original name Roger Meddows-Taylor; b. July 26, 1949, King’s Lynn, Norfolk, England).
Members of two bands composed of university and art-school students combined to form Queen in London in 1971. Aided by producer Roy Thomas Baker, Queen shot up the international charts with its third album, Sheer Heart Attack (1974). A Night at the Opera (1975), one of pop music’s most expensive productions, sold even better. Defiantly eschewing the use of synthesizers, the band constructed a sound that was part English music hall, part Led Zeppelin, epitomized by the mock-operatic “Bohemian Rhapsody,” Britain’s top single for nine weeks. Spectacular success followed in 1977 with “We Are the Champions” and “We Will Rock You”—which became ubiquitous anthems at sporting events in Britain and the United States. The Game (1980), featuring “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” and “Another One Bites the Dust,” was Queen’s first number one album in the United States. Their popularity waned for a period in the 1980s; however, a stellar performance at the charity concert Live Aid in 1985 reversed their fortunes commercially. Mercury died of AIDS in 1991, and the band issued its final album in 1995. Queen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. The band’s formation and its rise to stardom are the topics of the blockbuster film Bohemian Rhapsody (2018).
