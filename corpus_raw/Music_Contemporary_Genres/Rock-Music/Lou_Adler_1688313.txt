Although he lacked the signature sound of Phil Spector or Brian Wilson, Lou Adler was an important catalyst for the new folk-rock sound of California. After working with Herb Alpert as a songwriter, producer, and artist manager at Keen and Dore Records in the late 1950s, Adler became West Coast promotion man and song-plugger for Don Kirshner’s New York City-based Aldon Music. In that capacity he worked closely with Jan and Dean, and in 1964 he conceived and produced a very successful live album of “oldies” by Johnny Rivers.
In 1964 he formed Dunhill as a production outlet for songs by writers who included Steve Barri and P.F. Sloan. A year later Adler launched  Dunhill as a label and topped the chart with “Eve of Destruction,” a tongue-in-cheek catalog of reasons to be gloomy written by Sloan and sung by Barry McGuire in a pastiche of Bob Dylan’s style.  Three Dog Night and the Grass Roots were regular hit-makers, but the Mamas and the Papas became Dunhill’s flagship act on the strength of the hits “California Dreamin’ ” (1965) and “Monday, Monday” (1966). In 1967 the group’s leader, John Phillips, worked alongside Adler to celebrate the emergent West Coast music scene at the Monterey Pop Festival.  After selling Dunhill to ABC, Adler formed Ode Records and orchestrated a spectacular comeback for singer-songwriter Carole King, whose Tapestry (1971) became one of the best-selling albums of all time.
