The Ramones,  American band that influenced the rise of punk rock on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The original members were Joey Ramone (byname of Jeffrey Hyman; b. May 19, 1951, New York, New York, U.S.—d. April 15, 2001, New York), Johnny Ramone (byname of John Cummings; b. October 8, 1951, New York—d. September 15, 2004, Los Angeles, California), Dee Dee Ramone (byname of Douglas Colvin; b. September 18, 1952, Fort Lee, Virginia, U.S.—d. June 5, 2002, Los Angeles), and Tommy Ramone (byname of Erdelyi Tamas [later Thomas Erdelyi]; b. January 29, 1949, Budapest, Hungary—d. July 11, 2014, New York).
Founded in New York City in 1974, the Ramones cultivated a simple three-chord sound that became the foundation of punk rock. Played at a blistering tempo, frequently lasting little more than two minutes, and with catchy, often willfully inane lyrics (so stupid they were smart, according to some critics), Ramones songs such as “Blitzkrieg Bop,” “Sheena Is a Punk Rocker,” and “I Wanna Be Sedated” contrasted sharply with the complex, carefully orchestrated mainstream rock of the era. In ripped jeans and black leather jackets, the Ramones made their reputation with almost-nonstop touring and energetic live performances, notably at New York City’s CBGB club. Their tour of England in 1976 proved a major inspiration for the punk movement in Britain, where they enjoyed greater commercial success than at home. Influenced by the rebelliousness of their contemporaries the New York Dolls and by 1960s pop music (especially bubblegum and surf music), the Ramones brought their back-to-basics approach to such albums as their eponymous debut (1976) and Rocket to Russia (1977). With a shifting lineup, they continued to record and perform into the 1990s, disbanding in 1996. In 2002 the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2011 they received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.
