Aerosmith,  American heavy metal band. One of the biggest arena-rock attractions of the late 1970s, Aerosmith became even more popular with its career revival in the mid-1980s. Principal members were lead singer Steven Tyler (byname of Steven Tallarico; b. March 26, 1948, New York, New York, U.S.), lead guitarist Joe Perry (b. September 10, 1950, Boston, Massachusetts), guitarist Brad Whitford (b. February 23, 1952, Winchester, Massachusetts), bassist Tom Hamilton (b. December 31, 1951, Colorado Springs, Colorado), and drummer Joey Kramer (b. June 21, 1950, New York City).
Formed in 1970, the Boston-based band played bluesy, swaggering rock most reminiscent of the Rolling Stones. (Indeed, vocalist Tyler—the band’s driving force, along with guitarist Perry—resembled Mick Jagger.) Their later work also incorporated country music influences. Toys in the Attic (1975) and Rocks (1976) were multimillion sellers, but substance abuse and a dearth of creativity led to a period of inactivity for the band in the early 1980s. In 1986, two years after the return of Perry (who had left the band in 1979), Aerosmith returned to the limelight when Run-D.M.C. made a rap version of the band’s 1975 hit “Walk This Way.” Converted to sobriety, Aerosmith produced the multiplatinum-selling albums Permanent Vacation (1987) and Pump (1989). The latter featured the Grammy Award-winning “Janie’s Got a Gun,” and it marked a return to the hard rock success of Toys in the Attic. The band followed with Get a Grip (1993), an album that generated a pair of Grammys for the singles “Livin’ on the Edge” and “Crazy.” During this time, Aerosmith was a constant presence on MTV, and the group won numerous music video awards. The band’s next release, Nine Lives (1997), reached the top of the Billboard album chart, and the single “Pink” garnered a Grammy.
Later albums include Just Push Play (2001) and the blues tribute Honkin’ on Bobo (2004). In 2008 the band starred in the console video game Guitar Hero Aerosmith, in which players could perform some of the group’s greatest hits in a variety of virtual settings. A public feud between Tyler and Perry in 2009 fueled rumours of a possible breakup, with Perry suggesting that Aerosmith would find a replacement lead singer. Tyler underwent drug rehabilitation, returning to front the band for a summer 2010 tour, and he later served (2011–12) as a judge on the reality television show American Idol. Aerosmith released Music from Another Dimension! in 2012, and the band continued to tour thereafter. In 2001 Aerosmith was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
