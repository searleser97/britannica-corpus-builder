X,  American band whose tales of urban decay, corruption, and sleaze, delivered with skilled musicianship and unique vocal harmonies, marked them as important contributors to the punk movement. The original members were singer Exene Cervenka (original name Christine Cervenka; b. February 1, 1956, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.), bassist and singer John Doe (original name John Nommensen Duchac; b. February 25, 1953, Decatur, Illinois), guitarist Billy Zoom (original name Ty Kindell; b. February 20, 1948, Savanna, Illinois), and drummer D.J. Bonebrake (b. December 8, 1955, North Hollywood, California). Later members included Dave Alvin (b. November 11, 1955, Los Angeles, California) and Tony Gilkyson.
Formed in 1977, X released Los Angeles in 1980. That effort and the follow-up albums Wild Gift  (1981) and Under the Big Black Sun (1982) drew critical raves, as X broadened punk’s do-it-yourself ethos with excellent musicianship (Zoom, who had once played with rock-and-roll pioneer Gene Vincent, blazed through country, rockabilly, heavy metal, and punk licks with dispassionate aplomb, while Bonebrake added a background in jazz), the unusual harmonies and sophisticated songwriting of onetime husband and wife Doe and Cervenka (the latter an active poet), and careful production by Ray Manzarek, formerly of the Doors. In the process, X became prime movers of the Los Angeles punk scene chronicled in the documentary The Decline of Western Civilization (1981). Capable of matching the fury of other punk bands, X excelled at melancholy ballads and flirted with pop music throughout its career, though its efforts to reach a broader audience on a major label were largely unsuccessful.
The band toured and recorded sporadically throughout the 1980s and ’90s, but members were increasingly occupied by side projects and solo efforts. Doe, Cervenka, Alvin, and Bonebrake formed the Knitters in 1985. Intended as a one-time project, the Knitters performed a selection of folk and country tunes, along with acoustic versions of songs from the X catalog. Cervenka dedicated much of her time to poetry, publishing numerous collections and recording a series of solo albums. Doe turned to Hollywood, scoring small parts in films such as Road House (1989) and Boogie Nights (1997) and landing a recurring role in the supernatural television series Roswell (1999–2002). Alvin earned a Grammy Award for his traditional folk album Public Domain: Songs from the Wild Land (2000). The original X lineup reunited for a pair of concerts in 2004 (later collected in the album Live in Los Angeles [2005]), and the Knitters re-formed to record The Modern Sounds of the Knitters (2005). X continued to tour and perform well into the 21st century, but the band only returned to the studio after about 35 years to record Alphabetland (2020).
