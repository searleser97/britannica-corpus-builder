John Bonham, in full John Henry Bonham, byname Bonzo,  (born May 31, 1947, Redditch, Worcestershire, England—died September 25, 1980, Windsor), British rock musician and famed heavy-handed drummer of the Led Zeppelin rock band.
Bonham joined Led Zeppelin when it was formed in 1968. His aggressive drumming provided the rhythmical base for the group’s music and contributed largely to the success of the band, which gained an international reputation as pioneers of “acid rock.” During the late ’60s and early ’70s the group made many successful tours in Europe and the U.S. Bonham’s career started with the group Band of Joy, which also included Robert Plant, Led Zeppelin’s lead singer. Led Zeppelin made few public appearances after 1977, but it toured Europe shortly before Bonham’s accidental death, brought on by excessive drinking.
