ZZ Top,  American rock group famous for its rugged blues-driven guitar work, irreverent music videos, and embrace of its Texas roots, as well as for the musicians’ distinctive facial hair. The members are singer-guitarist Billy Gibbons (b. December 16, 1949, Houston, Texas, U.S.), bass player Dusty Hill (original name Joe Michael Hill, b. May 19, 1949, Dallas, Texas—d. July 27, 2021, Houston), and drummer Frank Beard (b. June 11, 1949, Frankston, Texas).
ZZ Top was formed in the Houston area when Gibbons, formerly of the blues-rock band Moving Sidewalks, united with Hill and Beard, who had previously performed together in the band American Blues. Taking its sonic cues from such blues artists as John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters, the band built a following with ZZ Top’s First Album (1970) and Rio Grande Mud (1971). Its breakthrough came in 1973 when the single “La Grange,” from Tres Hombres, became a radio hit. Two years later “Tush,” off the hit album Fandango, cracked the top 20 of the Billboard singles chart. The band’s Worldwide Texas Tour (1976)—during which they performed on a Texas-shaped stage littered with props that included cacti, snakes, and longhorn cattle—was one of the most successful concert tours of the 1970s.
Throughout the late 1970s and early ’80s, ZZ Top’s albums enjoyed consistent commercial success, and Eliminator (1983) turned them into international superstars. Incorporating electronic synthesizers and disco-influenced rhythms into their signature blues sound, the band projected a cartoonish public image in music videos in which Gibbons and Hill sported scraggly beards and flamboyant suits and which were punctuated by the threesome’s comic hand gestures. Buoyed by hits such as “Gimme All Your Lovin’,” “Sharp Dressed Man,” and “Legs,” Eliminator went on to sell more than 10 million copies. Afterburner (1985) yielded the additional hits “Rough Boy” and “Sleeping Bag.”
With Recycler (1990), ZZ Top scaled back the electronics. Though the massive following of the band’s 1980s commercial peak had dissipated, subsequent albums such as Antenna (1994) and La Futura (2012) still commanded a substantial audience, and XXX (1999), which commemorated 30 years of playing together, was a reminder of the group’s longevity. The trio remained a popular live act, notably performing at the inauguration of U.S. Pres. George W. Bush in 2001 and releasing the live album and DVD Live from Texas in 2008 and Live: Greatest Hits from Around the World in 2016. ZZ Top was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004.
