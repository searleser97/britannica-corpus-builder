Love,  American rock group formed in Los Angeles in the mid-1960s that was more popular with critics than with record buyers. The original members were Arthur Lee (b. 1945,  Memphis, Tenn., U.S.—d. Aug. 3, 2006, Memphis), Bryan MacLean (b. 1947, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.—d. Dec. 25, 1998), John Echols (b. 1945, Memphis), Ken Forssi (b. 1943, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.—d. Feb. 10, 1998), Don Conka, and Alban (“Snoopy”) Pfisterer (b. 1947, Switzerland). Later members included Jay Donnellan, Frank Fayad, George Suranovitch, and Tjay Cantrelli.
At the centre of the band was Lee, an enigmatic personality, soulful vocalist, and highly creative, if sometimes surreal, songwriter. He absorbed and transformed garage and Byrds-influenced folk rock styles on the band’s first three albums, incorporating jazz, blues, and psychedelic influences. Each of those albums generated a charting single, but the band’s otherwise moderate sales little indicate Love’s impact. Following the lush third album, Forever Changes (1968), a folk rock masterpiece, the band fragmented. Lee continued Love into the 1970s with new musicians, tending toward a heavier sound influenced by his friend Jimi Hendrix. An international cult of loyal fans supported Lee’s later resurfacings in the 1980s and ’90s. In 1996 Lee received a 12-year prison sentence for illegal gun possession. Released in 2001, he resumed touring with Love the following year.
