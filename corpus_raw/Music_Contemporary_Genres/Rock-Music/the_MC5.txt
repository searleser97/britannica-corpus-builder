The MC5,  American rock group, one of the most controversial and ultimately influential bands of the late 1960s. The principal members were vocalist Rob Tyner (original name Robert Derminer; b. December 12, 1944, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.—d. September 17, 1991, Royal Oak, Michigan), lead guitarist Wayne Kramer (original name Wayne Kambes; b. April 30, 1948, Detroit), rhythm guitarist Fred (“Sonic”) Smith (b. August 14, 1948, West Virginia—d. November 4, 1994, Detroit), drummer Dennis Thompson (original name Dennis Tomich; b. September 7, 1948), and bassist Michael Davis (b. June 5, 1943, Detroit—d. February 17, 2012, Chico, California).
Formed in suburban Detroit in 1965 as a bar band that played mostly cover versions of other performers’ songs, the MC5 (Motor City Five) developed a chaotic, heavy, explosive sound that borrowed from avant-garde jazz, rock, and rhythm and blues. Along with the music came a heavy dose of left-wing radical politics, largely through the influence of the band’s manager, John Sinclair. Sinclair was the founder of a political group patterned after the Black Panthers, the White Panther Party, for which the MC5 became the ministers of information. (In that capacity they performed outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.) Their first album, Kick Out the Jams (1969), a live recording named after their signature song, captures the loud, raw turbulence that characterized their powerful performances. Two more albums followed, including the Jon Landau-produced Back in the U.S.A. (1970), before the band broke up in 1972. Louder and brasher than the other political bands of their era, the MC5 were extremely influential despite their limited popularity, and their sound can be heard in heavy metal, punk rock, and grunge.
