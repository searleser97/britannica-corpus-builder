Richard Fariña,  (born April 30, 1937?, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died April 30, 1966, Carmel, Calif.), American folk singer and novelist who, with his wife, Mimi Fariña, played a significant role in the folk music revival of the 1960s.
Fariña studied engineering and literature at Cornell University and reputedly served with the Irish Republican Army in the mid-1950s and later briefly with Fidel Castro’s guerrillas in Cuba. While in Europe he met Mimi Baez (the younger sister of folksinger Joan Baez), and the two were married in 1963. A multi-instrumentalist (guitar, dulcimer, and zither) and gifted songwriter, Richard had released an album on which Bob Dylan had performed under the pseudonym “Blind Boy Grunt” before he and Mimi (who primarily played guitar) began performing together. Their highly regarded albums Celebrations for a Grey Day (1965) and Reflections in a Crystal Wind (1966) were early examples of folk rock, and the duo’s performance at the 1965 Newport (Rhode Island) Folk Festival seemed to promise great things to come.
Partially set at Cornell, Fariña’s first novel, Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me (1966; filmed 1971), was a comic work about the meaning of life, and it provided a portrait of the counterculture on the eve of the 1960s. His novel Long Time Coming and a Long Time Gone was published posthumously in 1969. Autobiographical and episodic, his fiction is humorous and irreverent, with a freewheeling quality reminiscent of the novels of the Beat writers of the 1950s.
