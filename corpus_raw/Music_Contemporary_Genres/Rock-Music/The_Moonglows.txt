The Moonglows,  American doo-wop vocal group that was one of the pioneering acts of rock and roll. The principal members were Bobby Lester (b. January 13, 1930, Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.—d. October 15, 1980, Louisville), Harvey Fuqua (b. July 27, 1929, Louisville—d. July 6, 2010, Detroit, Michigan), Alexander (“Pete”) Graves (b. April 17, 1930, Bessemer, Alabama?—d. October 15, 2006, New York, New York), and Prentiss Barnes (b. April 12, 1925, Magnolia, Mississippi—d. October 1, 2006, near Magnolia).
The Moonglows were discovered in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1952 by legendary disc jockey Alan Freed. Lester sang lead, Fuqua was the alternate lead, Graves the first tenor, and Barnes the bass. From 1953 to 1954 they had only minor success in the rhythm-and-blues market. They achieved national fame after signing with Chess Records in 1954. On such successful records as “Sincerely” (1954), “Most of All” (1955), “We Go Together” (1956), and “Ten Commandments of Love” (1958), the Moonglows perfected the distinctive rhythm-and-blues vocal technique called “blow harmony,” through which each singer’s blown breath becomes part of a deeply resonant harmonic sound. Freed helped make the group one of the most significant early rock-and-roll acts, including them in many of his stage shows and in his motion pictures Rock, Rock, Rock (1956) and Mr. Rock and Roll (1957). Fuqua, the group’s leader and songwriter (and later a producer, label owner, and promoter), broke up the ensemble in 1958 and formed a new Moonglows group, whose members included Marvin Gaye. The group disbanded in 1960 but reorganized in 1972. Later albums include The Return of the Moonglows (1972) and Sincerely (1991). The Moonglows were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.
