Chris Blackwell grew up in Jamaica but was educated in England. He founded Island Records in 1959 in Jamaica, then three years later relocated to the United Kingdom, where Island became an outlet for Jamaican records, initially aimed at immigrant communities throughout Britain. In 1964, still without the distribution capability to hit the pop charts, Blackwell licensed his more commercial projects to Philips Records, including his production of “My Boy Lollipop” by Millie Small, which became the first international hit with the distinctive back-to-front beat of Jamaican ska music, and a string of hits by the Spencer Davis Group, the Birmingham band whose teenage organ player, Stevie Winwood, had one of the most distinctive voices of the era.
In 1967 Blackwell and his partner David Betteridge relocated Island to the bohemian surroundings of London’s Notting Hill and redirected the company’s focus toward the emerging rock audience, signing album-oriented acts with a college-based market. Winwood’s new group, Traffic, became the flagship artist on Island’s new pink label, and the American producer Joe Boyd helped to create a new genre of British folk rock with his productions of Fairport Convention and Nick Drake. In order to make Island’s new direction clear, most Jamaican acts were released on various labels marketed by Trojan Records, run from separate premises under the supervision of Lee Gopthal. During the early 1970s Free and Roxy Music confirmed Island’s position as the preeminent British independent label, and this gave Blackwell the confidence to support Bob Marley and the Wailers as album artists and to carry the music of Jamaica to a worldwide rock audience.
