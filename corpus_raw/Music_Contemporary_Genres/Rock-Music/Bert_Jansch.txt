Bert Jansch,  (born November 3, 1943, Glasgow, Scotland—died October 5, 2011, Hampstead, London, England), Scottish-born guitarist, singer, and songwriter whose innovative and influential guitar technique made him one of the leading figures in British folk music in the 1960s and early 1970s, both as a solo artist and as a member of the folk-rock group Pentangle.
Influenced by American folk-blues performers such as Big Bill Broonzy, Jansch was part of the folk scene in Edinburgh, where he honed his skills as a guitarist before moving to London. Investing his playing style with baroque flourishes, he released several solo albums that featured both traditional material and original songs, including the highly regarded Jack Orion (1966). In 1967 he cofounded Pentangle, a folk-rock quintet that included another gifted guitarist, John Renbourn (with whom Jansch also collaborated outside the group), along with vocalist Jacqui McShee, bassist Danny Thompson, and drummer Terry Cox. Incorporating elements of jazz, blues, art rock, and traditional folk music (some dating to the Middle Ages), the band gained a cult following with the albums Basket of Light (1969) and Cruel Sister (1970), on the latter of which they briefly experimented with electric guitar.
Pentangle drifted apart in 1973 but re-formed with various lineups throughout the 1980s and ’90s. In 2007 the original quintet took to the stage for the first time in more than 30 years when Pentangle was honoured with the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards lifetime achievement award. The reunited band launched a successful tour of the United Kingdom and North America, and a boxed set of Pentangle’s early recordings sold well on the strength of positive reviews. Among the guitarists influenced by Jansch was Neil Young.
