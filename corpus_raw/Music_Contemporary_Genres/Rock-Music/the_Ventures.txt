The Ventures,  American musical group that gained fame with its instrumental interpretations of pop hits and that served as a prototype for guitar-based rock groups. The principal members were rhythm guitarist Don Wilson (b. February 10, 1933, Tacoma, Washington, U.S.), bassist Bob Bogle (b. January 16, 1934, Portland, Oregon—d. June 14, 2009, Vancouver, Washington), guitarist Nokie Edwards (b. May 9, 1935, Lahoma, Oklahoma—d. March 12, 2018, Yuma, Arizona), drummer Mel Taylor (b. September 24, 1933, New York, New York—d. August 11, 1996, Tarzana, California), and drummers Howie Johnson and Skip Moore.
Most instrumental groups of the 1950s and ’60s disappeared after one hit, but the longevity of the Ventures, the best-selling instrumental group of all time, demonstrated the enduring appeal of the genre as well as the band’s skill in choosing recording material. Formed in the Seattle, Washington, area in 1958, the Ventures established their own label to market their recordings, and their efforts paid off in 1960 when the single “Walk—Don’t Run” became a hit.  In 1964 the song was reworked with a more distinct “surf” sound and again was a success. Although the Ventures became identified as a surf band by featuring tremolo guitar and driving drums and bass, the band also adapted to musical trends and shifted their focus from the creation of singles to albums, which were often structured around themes and mixed cover versions with originals. One of their biggest hits, the theme for the television series Hawaii Five-O, came in 1969. In the 1970s the band became immensely popular in Japan. Despite numerous personnel changes, including the addition of Leon Taylor on drums after the death of his father Mel in 1996, the Ventures continued to produce records and perform in the 21st century. In 2008 they celebrated two milestones: their 50th anniversary as a band and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
