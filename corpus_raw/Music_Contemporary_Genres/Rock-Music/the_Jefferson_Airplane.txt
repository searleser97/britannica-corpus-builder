The Jefferson Airplane, later known as Jefferson Starship and Starship,  American psychedelic rock band best known for its biting political lyrics, soaring harmonies, and hallucinogenic titles, such as Surrealistic Pillow and “White Rabbit.” The Jefferson Airplane was an important standard-bearer for the counterculture in the 1960s, but in its later incarnations it had hits with more mainstream material in the 1970s and ’80s. The original members were Marty Balin (original name Martyn Jerel Buchwald; b. January 30, 1942, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.—d. September 27, 2018, Tampa, Florida), Paul Kantner (b. March 17, 1941, San Francisco, California, U.S.—d. January 28, 2016, San Francisco), Jorma Kaukonen (b. December 23, 1940,  Washington, D.C., U.S.), Signe Anderson (b. September 15, 1941, Seattle, Washington, U.S.—d. January 28, 2016, Beaverton, Oregon), Skip Spence (b. April 18, 1946, Ontario, Canada—d. April 16, 1999, Santa Cruz, California), Jack Casady (b. April 13, 1944, Washington, D.C.), and Bob Harvey. Later members included Grace Slick (original name Grace Barnett Wing; b. October 30, 1939, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.), Spencer Dryden (b. April 7, 1938, New York, New York, U.S.—d. January 10, 2005, Penngrove, California), Papa John Creach (b. May 28, 1917, Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, U.S.—d. February 22, 1994, Los Angeles, California), David Freiberg (b. August 24, 1938, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.), Craig Chaquico (b. September 26, 1954, Sacramento, California), and Aynsley Dunbar (b. January 10, 1946, Liverpool, Merseyside, England).
The band was started in the mid-1960s by former folk musicians; in late 1966, however, edgy-voiced ex-model Slick and the harder, rumbling rhythms pouring from bassist Casady and drummer Dryden transformed the Jefferson Airplane into a dance band with a social conscience. The Airplane was the first San Francisco-based band to land a major label contract. Their second album, Surrealistic Pillow (1967), produced two Top Ten singles, “White Rabbit” and “Somebody to Love,” both cowritten by Slick for her previous band, the Great Society, and drew hordes of fans to San Francisco’s Summer of Love pageantry. The city’s Haight-Ashbury neighbourhood had become the centre of the burgeoning hippie counterculture, but the commercialism and crime that rapidly overtook that bohemian enclave in the love fest’s wake were reflected in the bittersweet brilliance of the Airplane’s fourth album, Crown of Creation (1968).
Playing live at venues such as the Fillmore Auditorium, the band developed its crowd-pleasing version of the improvisational jamming that became the hallmark of the San Francisco sound pioneered by the Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company (featuring Janis Joplin), and Santana, among others. Casady, Dryden, and guitarist Kaukonen slashed and soared through extended psychedelic blues while songwriters Kantner, Slick, and Balin did not so much harmonize on as cohabit melodies and lyrics. The best onstage document of their approach, Bless Its Pointed Little Head, was one of two album releases in 1969; the other, Volunteers, was a call for youth revolt, a reaction to the police riots of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In addition to its agitprop title song, the album included the postapocalyptic “Wooden Ships,” cowritten by Kantner, David Crosby, and Stephen Stills. Volunteers was the Airplane’s final creative peak.
The band, its membership constantly shifting, released albums for 20 years as the Jefferson Airplane, Jefferson Starship, and Starship. Although it experienced commercial success—most notably with 1975’s chart-topping Red Octopus and its Top Ten single “Miracles”—the band never recaptured the moment when its music stood for something more, when the Airplane spoke for change on behalf of the culture that produced it. The Jefferson Airplane was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996.
