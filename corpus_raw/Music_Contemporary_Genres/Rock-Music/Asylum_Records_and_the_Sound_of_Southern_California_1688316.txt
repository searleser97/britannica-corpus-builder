The driving force behind Asylum Records, the musical embodiment of the “Me Decade” (writer Tom Wolfe’s characterization of the 1970s), was New York City-born David Geffen, who nurtured most of the major figures in the wave of singer-songwriters who followed Bob Dylan’s lead. Having learned the ropes with the William Morris Agency, Geffen and Elliot Roberts left that company to form a management partnership whose roster included Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. Although few of these stars were native Californians, let alone Angelenos, they became Los Angeles archetypes: white, long-haired, and self-interested, they made acoustic-based music that was as drenched in the California sun as the paintings of British expatriate David Hockney.
Geffen founded Asylum in 1970, sold out roughly two years later to Warner Brothers, and became president of the new Elektra-Asylum merger in 1973. By the time temporary ill health forced him into early retirement, the spirit of Asylum was typified by the Eagles. At one time Ronstadt’s backing group, they started out as a country rock outfit but mutated into the definitive guitar-based soft rock group whose songs mostly celebrated “takin’ it easy” but occasionally dug deeper—Hotel California (1976) was an unexpectedly sardonic take on the hedonistic lifestyle of Los Angeles in the 1970s. Those lampooned by the album’s title song were sometimes its most ardent admirers, unaware of the irony that it was recorded on the opposite coast in Miami’s Criteria Studios.
