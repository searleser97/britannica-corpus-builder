Captain Beefheart, byname of Don Van Vliet,  (born January 15, 1941, Glendale, California, U.S.—died December 17, 2010, Arcata, California),   innovative American avant-garde rock and blues singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist. Performing with the shifting lineup of musicians known as His Magic Band, Captain Beefheart produced a series of albums from the 1960s to the ’80s that had limited commercial appeal but were a major influence on punk and experimental rock.
A child prodigy as a sculptor, Beefheart grew up in the Mojave Desert region of California, where he and Frank Zappa met as teenagers. Having learned to play the harmonica and saxophone, Beefheart formed the first Magic Band in 1964, and the group (which briefly included Ry Cooder) had moderate success with the albums Safe as Milk (1967) and Strictly Personal (1968). Beefheart’s most famous recording, Trout Mask Replica (1969), produced by Zappa, proved an astonishing departure from previous rock conventions, combining eerie slide guitars, unpredictable rhythms, and surrealistic lyrics that Beefheart (who possessed a five-octave range) wailed with fierce intensity. His songs conveyed a deep distrust of modern civilization, a yearning for ecological balance, and the belief that animals in the wild are far superior to human beings. Although he won critical acclaim with Clear Spot (1972), Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) (1978), Ice Cream for Crow (1982), and other albums, Beefheart never won a wide popular following; however, his music greatly influenced such groups as the Clash and Devo. In the early 1980s Beefheart, again using the name Don Van Vliet, left the music business altogether and devoted himself to painting. He died in December 2010 of complications from multiple sclerosis.
