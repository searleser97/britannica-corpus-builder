Black Sabbath,  British band whose bludgeoning brand of rock defined heavy metal in the 1970s. The principal members were Ozzy Osbourne (byname of John Osbourne; b. December 3, 1948, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England), Terry (“Geezer”) Butler (b. July 17, 1949, Birmingham), Tony Iommi (b. February 19, 1948, Birmingham), and Bill Ward (b. May 5, 1948,  Birmingham).
Osbourne, Butler, Iommi, and Ward, schoolmates in Birmingham in the late 1960s, formed the blues bands Polka Tulk and Earth. These evolved into Black Sabbath, which was named after a Butler song inspired by a Boris Karloff movie. The band cultivated a dark and foreboding image with ominous guitar riffs, slow-churn tempos, and Osbourne’s sullen vocals. Black Sabbath’s lyrics, soaked in occult imagery, and coarse musicianship were reviled by critics and shunned by radio programmers, but constant touring turned them into stars, and songs such as “Paranoid,” “Iron Man,” and “War Pigs” became metal classics. By the end of the 1970s they had sold millions of records and had become the standard by which virtually every heavy metal band had to measure itself. Osbourne left the band in the late 1970s, and Ward and Butler later followed him out. Iommi kept the Black Sabbath name alive throughout the 1980s with a variety of musicians, and Osbourne forged a solo career marked by outrageous drug-fueled antics, best-selling albums, and the hugely popular MTV reality show The Osbournes (2002–05), which followed Osbourne and his family. In the 1990s the original lineup reunited on several occasions and released the live album Reunion (1998). It featured the single “Iron Man,” which earned the group its first Grammy Award, for best metal performance. Black Sabbath was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.
In 2013 the Rick Rubin-produced 13—the first Black Sabbath studio recording in 25 years on which Osbourne, Butler, and Iommi played together—topped charts around the world. The band won its second Grammy for the single “God Is Dead?” Black Sabbath embarked upon a farewell tour in 2015, with a final performance two years later; a live album and film, The End: Live in Birmingham, commemorated the show. The band received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement in 2019.
