Harry Chapin, in full Harry Foster Chapin,  (born Dec. 7, 1942, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died July 16, 1981,  Jericho, N.Y.),  American singer-guitarist who became as well known for his humanitarian efforts—particularly his antihunger crusade—as for his music.
Born into a musical family from the Brooklyn Heights section of New York City, Chapin played in bands with his brothers and made documentary films before debuting as a recording artist when he was nearly 30 years old. Success came quickly; his first album, Heads and Tales (1972), stayed in the Top 100 for more than six months, buoyed by the success of the hit single “Taxi.” Two other albums, Short Stories (1973) and Verities and Balderdash (1974), also produced hits—“W.O.L.D.” and the chart-topping “Cat’s in the Cradle,” respectively. Critics, however, charged that his narrative lyrics—as well as his grainy vocals and folkish arrangements—were masks for the sentimentality of musical theatre, a judgment some would say was borne out when Chapin produced a Broadway revue called The Night That Made America Famous (1975).
But if Chapin wore his heart on his sleeve, he also was a man of action. Asked to organize a benefit concert to fight world hunger, he embraced the cause, cofounding World Hunger Year in 1975 and making numerous trips to Capitol Hill and other forums. His tireless efforts garnered high praise from politicians and the press. Chapin’s music funded his activism in the second half of the decade, with every other concert a benefit. When he died in an auto accident in 1981, eulogies poured forth from all over the country, and Chapin’s widow accepted a Special Congressional Gold Medal on his behalf at a Carnegie Hall tribute concert in 1987. An album documenting the event, Harry Chapin Tribute, was released in 1990.
