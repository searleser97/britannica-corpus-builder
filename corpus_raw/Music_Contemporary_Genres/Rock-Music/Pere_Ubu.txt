Pere Ubu,  American avant-garde art rock band generally considered to be a major force and influence in postpunk music. The original members were David Thomas (b. June 14, 1953), Peter Laughner (b. c. 1953—d. June 22, 1977), Tom Herman (b. April 19, 1949), Allen Ravenstine (b. May 9, 1950), Scott Krauss (b. November 19, 1950), and Tim Wright (b. 1952, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.—d. August 4, 2013). Later members included Tony Maimone (b. September 27, 1952, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.), Jim Jones (b. March 12, 1950—d. February 18, 2008), Chris Cutler (b. January 4, 1947), Mayo Thompson (b. February 26, 1944), Anton Fier (b. June 20, 1956, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.), and Eric Drew Feldman (b. April 16, 1955). 
Formed in Cleveland in 1975 by music critics Thomas and Laughner (both former members of Rocket from the Tombs), Pere Ubu took its name from the principal character in Ubu roi (1896; “King Ubu”), a farce by French writer Alfred Jarry. The band’s combination of absurdist lyrics and often noisy and dissonant music endeared them to critics but did not lead to particularly impressive record sales. Their debut album, The Modern Dance (1978), nonetheless came to be regarded as notably influential. An almost endless stream of personnel and record-label changes further contributed to their relative obscurity, but it did not prevent Pere Ubu from producing consistently challenging work characterized by constant experimentation and innovation.
The group broke up in 1982, but many members quickly reconvened, recording as David Thomas and, sequentially, the Pedestrians, His Legs, and the Wooden Birds. As with the first incarnation of Pere Ubu, the inimitable Thomas (a Jehovah’s Witness who formerly called himself Crocus Behemoth) was the quirky and highly intellectual leader of the many different musical projects that once again congealed into Pere Ubu in 1987. Tales of alienation and fear and patterns of noise and sound eventually gave way to a more pop-oriented music on well-received recordings such as The Tenement Year (1988), Cloudland (1989), and Worlds in Collision (1991).
Pere Ubu’s music exploited new technology, and in the 1990s the band released hybrid CD-ROMs that blended music, video, and text. Signing with smaller record labels seemed to inspire the group, and Ray Gun Suitcase (1995) and Pennsylvania (1998) were viewed by many as worthy additions to the band’s critically acclaimed oeuvre. Later albums included St. Arkansas (2002); Long Live Père Ubu! (2009), from Thomas’s musical adaptation of Ubu roi, with the actress Sarah Jane Morris singing the part of Mère Ubu; Carnival of Souls (2014); 20 Years in a Montana Missile Silo (2017); and The Long Goodbye (2019).
