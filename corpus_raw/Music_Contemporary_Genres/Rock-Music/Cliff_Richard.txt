Cliff Richard, in full Sir Cliff Richard, original name Harry Roger Webb,  (born October 14, 1940, Lucknow, India), British singer whose “Move It” (1958) was the first great British rock-and-roll song.
Having played in skiffle bands during his youth in northern London, Richard, backed by a band that eventually became known as the Shadows, moved on to rock and roll. Dubbed the British Elvis Presley, he quickly found greater success as an all-around entertainer with pop hits such as “Living Doll” (1959) and as an actor in “clean teen” films such as The Young Ones (1961) and Summer Holiday (1962). Supplanted by the Beatles as British pop’s prime mover, Richard became a born-again Christian in 1965. Eternally youthful, he went on to produce more than 100 hits en route to becoming a national figure in Britain, though he remained little known in the United States. He continued to perform and record into the early 21st century. Richard was knighted in 1995.
