The Replacements,  American rock band that combined the intensity of punk with melodic hooks and heartfelt lyrics, in the process providing an important bridge from the punk movement of the late 1970s to the alternative rock of the late 1980s. The principal members were guitarist-vocalist Paul Westerberg (b. December 31, 1960, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.), drummer Chris Mars (b. April 26, 1961, Minneapolis), guitarist Bob Stinson (b. December 17, 1959,  Mound, Minnesota—d. February 15, 1995, Minneapolis), and bassist Tommy Stinson (b. October 6, 1966, San Diego, California).
Formed in 1979 by Westerberg, Mars, and Bob Stinson—all in their teens—and Stinson’s 12-year-old brother, Tommy, the Replacements emerged from the thriving Minneapolis music scene of the early 1980s that also produced Prince and the influential hardcore band Hüsker Dü, with whom the Replacements were compared by virtue of the straight-ahead punk sound of their debut album, Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash (1981). With an attitude as petulant as that of their early songs, the Replacements were renowned for erratic live performances that ranged from inspired anarchy to drunken chaos.
On their third recording, Hootenanny (1983), they began to include country and blues influences, which set the stage for three eclectic, critically acclaimed albums: Let it Be (1984), Tim (1985), and Pleased to Meet Me (1987). The albums document Westerberg’s growing sophistication as a pop tunesmith, but they promised a commercial breakthrough that never came. An unstable blend of personalities, the Replacements dissolved after All Shook Down (1990), which was essentially a solo album by Westerberg, whose solo career was the most successful of those of the ex-Replacements. A lineup of the Replacements that included Westerberg and Tommy Stinson played several high-profile concerts in 2013–15 before breaking up again.
