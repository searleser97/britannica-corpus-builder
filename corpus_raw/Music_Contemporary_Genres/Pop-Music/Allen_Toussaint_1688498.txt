During the 1960s Allen Toussaint took over the mantle of the Crescent City’s musical master chef from Dave Bartholomew. Acting as songwriter, pianist, and producer, Toussaint was responsible for national hits by Ernie K-Doe, Chris Kenner, Jessie Hill, Aaron Neville, Irma Thomas, and the Showmen, all recorded for local entrepreneur Joe Banashak’s Minit label. Many of the songs were written at informal rehearsals with the singers in the front room of Toussaint’s parents’ home and then recorded at J&M Studio with many of the session musicians who had played on Fats Domino’s hits in the 1950s.
When Toussaint and promotion man Marshall Sehorn set up Sea-Saint Studios in the mid-1960s, a new group of session musicians emerged, including Art Neville on organ, Leo Nocentelli on guitar, George Porter on bass, and Joseph Modeliste on drums. These musicians evolved a new variation of New Orleans’s famous “second line” rhythm (distinctive accents on the second and fourth beats that fell later than standard practice) on Lee Dorsey’s international hits “Working in a Coal Mine” and “Holy Cow” (both released in 1966 on Bell Records’s Amy label). The rhythm section subsequently recorded their own string of hits as the Meters, including “Cissy Strut” (1969), pioneering the syncopations that came to be called funk. One of the major figures of his era, Toussaint continued to be in demand into the early 1970s, producing Dr. John’s only Top Ten hit, “Right Place, Wrong Time” (1973), and Labelle’s “Lady Marmalade” (1974) at Sea-Saint Studios.  Art and Aaron Neville joined forces with their brothers Charles and Cyril in 1977 to form the Neville Brothers and became ambassadors for the sound of New Orleans. Despite their success, the city lost its place as a primary recording centre until the late 1990s when rap performers doubling as entrepreneurs, including Master P, gave New Orleans a new lease on life.
