Natalie Cole, in full Natalie Maria Cole,  (born February 6, 1950, Los Angeles, California, U.S.—died December 31, 2015, Los Angeles), American singer who forged a successful career performing rhythm and blues and jazz-based pop music.
The daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole, she earned a degree in child psychology from the University of Massachusetts in 1972. Although uncertain about pursuing a career in entertainment, she accepted a summer job singing with a band and was soon performing regularly. In 1974 she met Chuck Jackson and Marvin Yancy, songwriters and record producers who became frequent collaborators and helped her sign with Capitol Records. A string of rhythm-and-blues albums followed, beginning with her debut album, Inseparable (1975), which earned Cole two Grammy Awards, including one for best new artist. The following year Natalie was released, which went gold and received a Grammy for the hit single “Sophisticated Lady.” Her success continued with Unpredictable (1977) and Thankful (1977), both of which went platinum.
In the early 1980s Cole’s career stalled because of drug problems and a serious throat ailment. She eventually overcame her difficulties, and by the end of the decade she had begun singing more jazz-inspired pop. Her comeback was completed in 1991 with the release of Unforgettable with Love, a double album that featured her father’s classics, including “Smile,” “The Very Thought of You,” and “Mona Lisa.” A commercial and critical success, it was Cole’s first album to reach number one and earned three Grammy Awards. The title track was digitally engineered to simulate a father-and-daughter duet. Later albums include Take a Look (1993), Snowfall on the Sahara (1999), and Ask a Woman Who Knows (2002). She returned to her father’s songbook for Still Unforgettable (2008), a collection of romantic standards that won the Grammy Award for best traditional pop vocal album in 2009. In 2000 her autobiography, Angel on My Shoulder (written with Digby Diehl), was published.
