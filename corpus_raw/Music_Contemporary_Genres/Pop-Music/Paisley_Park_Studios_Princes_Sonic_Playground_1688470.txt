Although Prince had moved to New York City in 1976, signed to Warner Brothers in 1978, and established his revolutionary working practices by 1980, it was not until his heyday in the mid-1980s that his impact was fully felt. Many of Prince’s riffs and rhythms drew from funk’s rich history—notably from James Brown and George Clinton—but what was entirely novel was the way he made his music alone in the studio, a development made possible by the rapid development of the microprocessor. While Europeans working in the same manner chose to emphasize the mechanical nature of computer-generated music, Prince grabbed the opportunity it offered for control. A formidable guitarist, he sometimes used a backing group, but his music was always essentially a solo creation, entirely envisaged and produced by Prince. Removing himself from established industry centres, he opened his own studio in suburban Minneapolis in 1982 and by 1987 had his own label and recording complex, both named Paisley Park—as advertised in his 1985 single of the same name. From this isolated base, he helped rejuvenate pop music not only with his own records but also with songs and productions of other artists, particularly female singers such as Chaka Khan, Cyndi Lauper, and Sheena Easton.
