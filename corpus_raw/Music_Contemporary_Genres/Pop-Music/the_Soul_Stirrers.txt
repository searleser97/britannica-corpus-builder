The Soul Stirrers,  American gospel singers who were one of the first male quintets and one of the most enduring male groups. Several singers emerged from the group’s ranks to become influential rhythm-and-blues and soul singers, most notably Sam Cooke. The members included S.R. Crain (in full Senior Roy Crain), J.J. Farley, R.H. Harris (Robert H. Harris), Sam Cooke (b. January 22, 1931, Clarksdale, Mississippi, U.S.—d. December 11, 1964, Los Angeles, California), and Johnnie Taylor (b. May 5, 1938, Crawfordsville, Arkansas—d. May 31, 2000, Dallas, Texas).
The Soul Stirrers began singing together in Trinity, Texas, about 1932, recorded for the U.S. Library of Congress in 1936, and added Harris the next year. Influenced by blues singers, Harris demonstrated wide emotional range and became a major influence on other lead singers. The Soul Stirrers sang at the White House for President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill before Harris left in 1950. His young replacement, Cooke, sang sensual tenor lines with unusual rhythmic freedom and composed songs such as “Nearer to Thee” (1955) and “Touch the Hem of His Garment” (1956) before leaving the group in 1957 to pursue a career in pop music. His replacement, Taylor, sang with Cooke-like melisma before becoming a rhythm-and-blues star. The Soul Stirrers, with further personnel changes, remained active into the 21st century. The pre-Cooke lineup of the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989.
