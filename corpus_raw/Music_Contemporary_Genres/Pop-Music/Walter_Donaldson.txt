Walter Donaldson,  (born Feb. 15, 1893, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died  July 15, 1947, Santa Monica, Calif., U.S.), U.S. lyricist, arranger, pianist, and prolific composer of popular songs for stage productions and films.
Donaldson began his career as a pianist for a music publisher. After 19 months spent entertaining troops at Camp Upton, New York, during World War I, he joined the new publishing firm of composer Irving Berlin. In 1928 he established his own music publishing company, Donaldson, Douglas and Gumble.
Donaldson’s first success on Broadway was with “My Mammy,” introduced by Al Jolson in the show Sinbad (1918), and he continued writing for Broadway revues for more than 25 years. The period 1925–28 was his most productive and lucrative. His most popular compositions include “My Buddy,” “My Blue Heaven,” “Yes Sir, That’s My Baby,” “Love Me or Leave Me,” “Carolina in the Morning,” “You’re Driving Me Crazy,” and his score for Whoopee (1928). He collaborated with many of the best known lyricists of his day, among them Gus Kahn, Sam M. Lewis, Joe Young, Edgar Leslie, Harold Adamson, and Johnny Mercer. Donaldson first contributed songs, incidental music, and arrangements to films in 1934 and worked on The Great Ziegfeld (1936), Sinner Take All (1936), After the Thin Man (1936), and Saratoga (1937), among others. His work was characteristically lighthearted or sentimental, and his lyrics frequently made use of the vernacular, as in his 1943 song “What’s Buzzin’, Cousin?”
