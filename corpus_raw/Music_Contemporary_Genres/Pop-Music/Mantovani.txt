Mantovani, in full Annunzio Paolo Mantovani,  (born November 15, 1905, Venice, Italy—died March 29, 1980, Royal Tunbridge Wells, England), Italian-born British conductor and musician who favoured a technique that came to be known as “cascading strings,” a lush musical effect that became the hallmark of his style.
The son of a violinist at the Covent Garden Opera, Mantovani showed an early talent for the violin and was giving recitals of classical music by age 16. Eventually, however, Mantovani found that his real talent lay in popular music, and, after a successful period with the Hotel Metropole orchestra, he formed his own band. The band prospered, but it was not until, with the help of arranger Ronnie Binge, Mantovani developed its distinctive strings that he achieved great popularity. From then on, huge international record sales and a weekly radio program installed the undemanding Mantovani sound into millions of homes. Mantovani’s popularity endured while many other pops orchestras were being driven out of business by rock and roll and succeeding trends in popular music. Among the more than 100 million Mantovani records sold were such gold disc titles as “Charmaine,” “Wyoming,” and “Lovely Lady.”
