Industrial music,  dissonant electronic music that arose in the late 1970s in response to punk rock. Coined by British postpunk experimentalists Throbbing Gristle, the term industrial simultaneously evoked the genre’s bleak, dystopian worldview and its harsh, assaultive sound (“muzak for the death factories,” as Throbbing Gristle put it). Believing that punk’s revolution could be realized only by severing its roots in traditional rock, industrial bands deployed noise, electronics, hypnotic machine rhythms, and tape loops. Instead of rallying youth behind political slogans, industrial artists preferred to “decondition” the individual listener by confronting taboos. Key literary influences were J.G. Ballard’s anatomies of aberrant sexuality and the paranoid visions and “cut-up” collage techniques of William S. Burroughs.
By the early 1980s Throbbing Gristle and its allies—Nurse with Wound, Current 93, Coil, 23 Skidoo—had shifted from fetishizing horror to a neo-pagan fascination with occult magic and mystical arcana. Throbbing Gristle’s leader, Genesis P-Orridge, formed the less abrasive Psychic TV and a cultlike “fan club” called Temple Ov Psychick Youth. However, many of Orridge’s acolytes were alienated when their guru abandoned the “dark side” for the ecstatic trance dancing and “positivity” of the acid house scene in 1988. The industrial legacy was reaching the dance floor by another route, too—the regimented rhythms of electronic body music (Front 242, Nitzer Ebb), Canada’s Front Line Assembly and Skinny Puppy, and Chicago’s Wax Trax! label. In the 1990s industrial invaded the U.S. mainstream, with Ministry and Nine Inch Nails offering a kind of cyber-grunge counterpart to the raging guitars of post-Nirvana alternative rock.
