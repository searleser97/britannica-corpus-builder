Pet Shop Boys,  British pop music duo that produced a string of international hits beginning in the 1980s. The band comprised Neil Tennant (b. July 10, 1954, North Shields, Tyne and Wear, England) and Chris Lowe (b. October 4, 1959, Blackpool, Lancashire).
Formed in London in 1981 by vocalist Tennant (then a writer for the music magazine Smash Hits) and keyboardist Lowe, the Pet Shop Boys arrived at a clever pairing of ironic, coolly delivered lyrics and catchy synthesizer-based dance music, underlain by emotional tension. Influenced by the music of gay nightclubs, the duo—who maintained an air of sexual ambiguity even after Tennant came out as gay in 1994—incorporated the sounds of disco, the frenetic style known as Hi-NRG, house, and techno. Their first single, “West End Girls,” recorded with American producer Bobby Orlando, became a hit in France and Belgium in 1984, but it was not until two years later that a rerecorded version of the song shot to number one in Britain, the United States, and several other countries. Subsequent hits included “Opportunities (Let’s Make Lots of Money)” from the duo’s first album, Please (1986), and “It’s a Sin,” “Rent,” “Heart,” and “What Have I Done to Deserve This?” (a collaboration with Dusty Springfield) from Actually (1987).
In 1988 the Pet Shop Boys starred in their own film, It Couldn’t Happen Here, a surreal cross-country journey scored with the duo’s hits, including their remake of Elvis Presley’s “Always on My Mind.” In 1989 the pair, which until then had rarely performed live, undertook a tour that was elaborately staged by the painter and film director Derek Jarman; later tours also featured lavish sets, including one designed by architect Zaha Hadid. Pet Shop Boys songs continued to place high on the British singles chart in the 1990s, and their 1993 album, Very, made the top 20 in the United States and reached number one in Britain. Thereafter their commercial fortunes somewhat waned, although such recordings as Bilingual (1996), Release (2002), Elysium (2012), Electric (2013), Super (2016), and Hotspot (2020) demonstrated the durability of their appeal.
In the early 21st century the Pet Shop Boys engaged in further interdisciplinary projects, notably creating the musical Closer to Heaven (2001), a soundtrack (first performed 2004) to the 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin, and the score to the ballet The Most Incredible Thing (2011). In addition, they wrote A Man from the Future, an eight-part orchestral piece based on the life of British mathematician Alan Turing that debuted in 2014. In 2009 the duo received a Brit Award (the British equivalent of a Grammy) for its outstanding contribution to British music.
