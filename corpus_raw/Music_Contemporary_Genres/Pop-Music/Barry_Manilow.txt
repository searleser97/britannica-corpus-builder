Barry Manilow, original name Barry Alan Pincus,  (born June 17, 1943, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.), American pop singer and songwriter who specialized in elaborately orchestrated romantic ballads, which first won him a wide audience in the 1970s.
Barry Pincus grew up in a lower-class neighbourhood in Brooklyn. When he was two years old, his father left the family, and several years later Barry assumed his mother’s maiden name, Manilow. In his youth he took up the accordion and the piano, becoming an accomplished musician, and through his stepfather he acquired a taste for jazz and Broadway show tunes. After briefly studying advertising at City College of the City University of New York, Manilow took classes at the New York College of Music (now part of New York University) and later at Juilliard School of Music.
To support his education, Manilow worked in the mail room at CBS, which eventually led to jobs for the network’s local television affiliate, first as a film editor and then, in 1967, as the music director for a talent show. By the early 1970s he had composed and arranged songs for an Off-Broadway theatrical production and had written a number of jingles for nationally broadcast television commercials. While working as a piano accompanist in nightclubs, he met the singer Bette Midler and soon became her music director, accompanying her on tour and coproducing her first two albums.
About the same time, Manilow recorded his own debut album, Barry Manilow (1973; later released as Barry Manilow I), a stylistically diverse collection of songs that initially sold tepidly. He found greater success with Barry Manilow II (1974), mostly owing to “Mandy,” a florid ballad that rose to the top of the Billboard singles chart. A string of other popular albums soon followed, featuring such hits as “I Write the Songs” (1975), which, ironically, he did not write; the sentimental “Looks Like We Made It” (1976); and the disco-inspired “Copacabana (At the Copa)” (1978), which won a Grammy Award for best male pop vocal performance. A skilled entertainer, Manilow also regularly performed during this time. A concert that he presented on Broadway in 1976–77 earned him a special Tony Award and yielded a live album (1977) that eventually sold more than three million copies. In addition, beginning in the late 1970s Manilow starred in a number of television specials, for which he won two Emmy Awards (1977, 2006).
In 1984 Manilow moved away from mainstream pop with the jazz album 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe (1984), which featured appearances from Sarah Vaughan and Gerry Mulligan, among others. Subsequent albums—including Swing Street (1987), Showstoppers (1991), and Singin’ with the Big Bands (1994)—found Manilow seeking further inspiration from the pre-rock era. As his career progressed, he continued to work on projects beyond the recording studio. In 1985 Manilow starred in Copacabana, a television movie that he had also helped create; it was later adapted for the stage. After composing the soundtracks to the animated films Thumbelina (1994) and The Pebble and the Penguin (1995), Manilow cowrote (with Bruce Sussman) the musical Harmony, which was performed in La Jolla, California, in 1997.
Although Manilow’s album sales had declined in the 1980s and ’90s, his recording career experienced a resurgence in the 21st century. The Greatest Songs of the Fifties (2006) was his first number-one album in nearly 30 years, and later albums in which Manilow covered songs of the past also proved popular. His later releases included 15 Minutes: Fame…Can You Take It? (2011), a collection of original pop songs; My Dream Duets (2014), on which he accompanied vocal tracks by such deceased performers as Whitney Houston, Judy Garland, and Louis Armstrong; and This Is My Town: Songs of New York (2017). He also recorded two albums of standards, Night Songs (2014) and Night Songs II (2020). During this time he also starred in the stage production Manilow on Broadway (2013). While his adeptly crafted, heartfelt music attracted legions of fans throughout his career, Manilow was not without his critics, who derided his style as schmaltzy and bombastic. An autobiography, Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise, was released in 1987.
