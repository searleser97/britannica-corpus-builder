The Shangri-Las,  American girl group whose string of hits in the mid-1960s included the bad-boy anthem “Leader of the Pack” (1964). The group was formed in 1963 by two pairs of sisters: Mary Weiss (b. December 28, 1948, Queens, New York, U.S.) and Betty Weiss (byname of Elizabeth Weiss; b. November 27, 1946, Queens) and twins Margie Ganser (byname of Marguerite Ganser; b. February 4, 1948, Queens—d. July 28, 1996, Valley Stream, New York) and Mary-Ann Ganser (b. February 4, 1948, Queens—d. March 14, 1970, Queens).
The quartet, who all attended the same high school in Queens, began performing at area nightclubs in 1963 and had achieved some local success when they were noticed by producer George (“Shadow”) Morton. Morton, who was auditioning for work with the newly formed Red Bird label, recruited the Shangri-Las to perform his song “Remember (Walking in the Sand).” The label promptly hired Morton and signed the Shangri-Las to a recording contract. With Mary in the lead, and the others providing backing vocals, a reworked version of “Remember (Walking in the Sand)” reached the Top Five in the summer of 1964. Morton then enlisted songwriting veterans at the Brill Building to provide the group with material. The Shangri-Las’ next single proved to be their defining hit. “Leader of the Pack,” which topped the charts in 1964, was a tale of rebellion punctuated by the crack of a motorcycle engine. About that time, Betty left the band, but the Shangri-Las continued as a trio, touring throughout 1965–66 and scoring a Top Ten hit with “I Can Never Go Home Anymore” (1965). Red Bird folded in 1966, and the Shangri-Las, unable to find success at another label, disbanded two years later.
