Peter Tosh, original name Winston Hubert McIntosh,  (born October 19, 1944, Grange Hill, Jamaica—died September 11, 1987, Kingston), Jamaican singer-songwriter and a founding member of the Wailers, a popular reggae band of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Tosh, Bob Marley, and Bunny Wailer formed the Wailers in 1963 in the Kingston ghetto of Trench Town. In addition to his rich baritone, Tosh brought to the Wailers his versatile musicianship and songs such as “Get Up, Stand Up” (written with Marley) and “Stop That Train.” An aggressive defender of the principals of Rastafari (Rastafarianism) and a militant opponent of the political establishment, Tosh carried himself with bravado and was long associated with the dignity-demanding song “Stepping Razor.” By 1974, jealous of the attention focused on Marley as the Wailers’ popularity grew, Tosh, like Wailer before him, left the group to pursue a solo career. His albums—most notably Legalize It (1976), Equal Rights (1977), and No Nuclear War (1987)—featured uncompromising political messages about subjects ranging from the legalization of marijuana to the abuse of power. His work earned the respect of fans and fellow musicians—he was a favourite of the Rolling Stones and recorded a duet with Mick Jagger, “(You Gotta Walk) Don’t Look Back” (1978)—but incurred the enmity of the authorities he criticized. He was badly beaten by police during his arrest for possession of marijuana in 1978. Nine years later Tosh was murdered in his home. He posthumously received the Jamaican Order of Merit in 2012.
