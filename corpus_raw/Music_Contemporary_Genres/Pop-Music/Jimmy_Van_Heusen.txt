Jimmy Van Heusen, byname of Edward Chester Babcock,  (born Jan. 26, 1913, Syracuse, N.Y., U.S.—died  Feb. 7, 1990, Rancho Mirage, Calif.), U.S. songwriter who composed for films, stage musicals, and recordings that most often featured singers Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra.
Van Heusen worked as a staff pianist at music publishing companies in New York City before collaborating with lyricist Eddie de Lange to write songs, including the popular “Darn That Dream,” for a Broadway show Swingin’ the Dream. The next year “Polka Dots and Moonbeams,” “All This and Heaven Too,” “Shake Down the Stars,” and “Imagination” helped to establish him as one of the most successful and prolific composers; indeed, in one season he released 60 songs. With his lyricist partner (1940–53) Johnny Burke he wrote the songs for 23 Crosby films; in 1954 he began collaborating with lyricist Sammy Cahn.
Altogether he was credited with composing 76 songs for his friend Sinatra, including “The Tender Trap” and “Come Fly with Me.” Van Heusen won Oscars for composing “Swinging on a Star” (1944), “All the Way” (1957), “High Hopes” (1959), and “Call Me Irresponsible” (1963), and an Emmy for “Love and Marriage” (1956).
