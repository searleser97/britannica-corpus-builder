Nora Bayes, original name Dora Goldberg,  (born 1880, Joliet, Ill., U.S.—died March 19, 1928, Brooklyn, N.Y.), American singer in vogue in the early 1900s in musical revues, notably the Ziegfeld Follies.
Bayes began her career in Chicago in 1899 and made her Broadway debut in 1901. She was identified with the songs “Down Where the Wurzburger Flows” (1902) and “Shine on, Harvest Moon” (1908), which were written by her husband, Jack Norworth, who was her singing partner during their marriage (1908–13). During World War I Bayes introduced George M. Cohan’s famous “Over There.” In 1919 a New York theatre was named for her.
