Sammy Cahn, byname of Samuel Cohen,  (born June 18, 1913, New York, N. Y., U.S.—died Jan. 15, 1993, Los Angeles), American lyricist who, in collaboration with such composers as Saul Chaplin, Jule Styne, and Jimmy Van Heusen, wrote songs that won four Academy Awards and became number one hits for many performers, notably Frank Sinatra.
After dropping out of high school, Cahn published his first song, “Shake Your Head From Side to Side” (1933), the only song for which he wrote both the words and music. The songwriting team of Cahn and Chaplin had their first hit with “Rhythm Is Our Business” (1935), written for bandleader Jimmie Lunceford. Cahn wrote English lyrics for the Yiddish song “Bei Mir Bist du Schoen” (1933), which became a number one hit for the Andrews Sisters in 1938. For the next decade and a half, Cahn collaborated with Styne to write songs for many motion pictures, Broadway musicals, and hit recordings, including the Academy Award-winning “Three Coins in the Fountain,” from the 1954 film of the same name. In 1955 Cahn and Van Heusen formed a partnership and wrote material for Sinatra, whose recordings won them Oscars for “All the Way” (1957), “High Hopes” (1959), and “Call Me Irresponsible” (1963). In 1974 Cahn published I Should Care: The Sammy Cahn Story and performed “Words and Music,” his own one-man Broadway show.
