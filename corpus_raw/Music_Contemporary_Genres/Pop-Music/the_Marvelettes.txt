The Marvelettes,  American girl group formed in 1961 whose principal members were Gladys Horton (b. May 30, 1945, Gainesville, Florida, U.S.—d. January 26, 2011, Sherman Oaks, California), Wanda Young (b. 1944, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), Georgeanna Tillman (b. February 6, 1943, Detroit—d. January 6, 1980, Detroit), Katherine Anderson (b. January 16, 1944, Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.), and Wyanetta Cowart (b. 1944, Detroit).
Originally billed as the Casinyets (a name derived from the phrase can’t sing yet) and later called the Marvels, the Marvelettes were a collection of high-school friends from the Detroit suburb of Inkster. The quintet was organized by Horton to perform at a talent show that offered as its top prize an audition with a scout from Motown Records. Although the group failed to win, they were allowed to attend the audition. The Motown representative advised the group to work on some original material, and the result was the song “Please Mr. Postman.” Motown founder Berry Gordy, Jr., signed the singers, and a reworked “Please Mr. Postman,” featuring a young Marvin Gaye on drums, was released as their debut single. The song went to the top of the pop charts, and it provided Motown with its first number one pop single.
Other successful singles by the Marvelettes followed, including “Playboy” (1962), “Beechwood 4-5789” (1962), “Too Many Fish in the Sea” (1964), and “Don’t Mess with Bill” (1965). Perhaps most notable during the group’s later career was the song that they chose not to record—the Holland-Dozier-Holland-written track “Where Did Our Love Go?” (1964), which proved to be a huge hit for the then-struggling Supremes. As Motown’s business objectives changed, support for the Marvelettes waned, and the group drifted apart in the late 1960s.
