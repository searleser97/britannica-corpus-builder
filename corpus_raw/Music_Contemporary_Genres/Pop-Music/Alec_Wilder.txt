Alec Wilder, in full Alexander Lafayette Chew Wilder,  (born February 16, 1907, Rochester, New York, U.S.—died December 24, 1980, Gainesville, Florida), American composer best known for his collaboration with singers Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby.
Wilder had an eclectic musical career as the composer of popular music during the 1930s and ’40s, a blend of popular and classical music during the 1940s, and chamber music during the 1950s. Although Wilder produced hundreds of popular songs, his most memorable compositions were for Sinatra and Crosby, including “I’ll Be Around,” “It’s So Peaceful in the Country,” and “While We’re Young.” His conviction that “the best of popular music is really great melody writing” was explored in his 1972 book American Popular Song (cowritten with James T. Maher), but his uniqueness was downgraded by contemporary critics who regarded his music as “frivolous.”
