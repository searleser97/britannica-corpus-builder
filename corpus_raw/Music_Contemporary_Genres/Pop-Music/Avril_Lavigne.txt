Avril Lavigne, in full Avril Ramona Lavigne,  (born September 27, 1984, Belleville, Ontario, Canada), Canadian singer and songwriter who achieved great success as a teenager. She was known for a grungy pop-rock sound.
Lavigne grew up in Napanee, Ontario. Her natural singing ability was evident by age two, and she began singing at church and at local events. Christian tunes and country songs dominated her early singing, and her parents, in line with their strict Christian faith, carefully monitored her choice of music. Her singing ability and precocious confidence caught the attention of her first manager, who spotted her at a 1999 performance in a bookstore, when she was 14 years old. That same year she won a contest to perform a duet with Canadian icon Shania Twain before an audience of 20,000. In 1999–2000 Lavigne contributed vocals on the albums of local folksinger Stephen Medd.
With her parents’ permission, Lavigne then quit school and moved to New York City with her brother. There she worked with a professional music producer and signed, at age 16, a two-album contract worth approximately $1.25 million. After she relocated to Los Angeles to fine-tune her songs and her sound, her first album, Let Go, debuted in 2002 and went 6× platinum. It featured the hits “Complicated,” “Sk8er Boi,” “I’m with You,” and “Losing Grip.” Her popularity and fame continued with the albums Under My Skin (2004), The Best Damn Thing (2007), Goodbye Lullaby (2011), and Avril Lavigne (2013). Lavigne was diagnosed with a severe case of Lyme disease in 2014 and took a break from performing and recording to recuperate. Her medical struggles informed her sixth studio album, Head Above Water (2019).
Lavigne’s songs were featured in several films, including Sweet Home Alabama (2002), Bruce Almighty (2003), Legally Blonde 2 (2003), The Princess Diaries 2 (2004), and The House Bunny (2008). She had a voice role in the animated film Over the Hedge (2006) and appeared in such movies as Fast Food Nation (2006) and The Flock (2007). She wrote the song “Alice” for Tim Burton’s film Alice in Wonderland (2010). In 2007 two songwriters sued Lavigne over her hit song “Girlfriend,” which they claimed had been plagiarized from their 1979 song “I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend.” The case was settled out of court.
In her early years of performing, Lavigne received the nickname “Punk Princess” for her punk outfits and multicoloured hair. Teen girls the world over imitated her signature clothing style, notably tank tops and T-shirts with neckties. She was perceived as a tomboy/skater-girl contrast to fellow pop star Britney Spears, but her persona softened as she matured. She launched multiple perfume brands and her own fashion line, Abbey Dawn. Her music earned her multiple Grammy Award nominations and Canadian Juno Awards.
