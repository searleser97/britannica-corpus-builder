Nelson Riddle,  (born June 1, 1921, Oradell, N.J., U.S.—died Oct. 6, 1985, Los Angeles, Calif.),  American popular-music arranger, conductor, and composer, regarded as the premier 20th-century arranger for popular singers.
Riddle began his career in the 1940s as a trombonist-arranger for the orchestras of Tommy Dorsey, Bob Crosby, Charlie Spivak, and Jerry Wald. His first noted arrangements for a popular singer were the songs “Mona Lisa” and “Too Young,” recorded in 1950 by Nat King Cole, with whom Riddle would work frequently during the next 15 years. During the 1950s Riddle was a staff arranger for Capitol Records and arranged songs for several of the top singers of the day, including Dean Martin, Judy Garland, Rosemary Clooney, Peggy Lee, Margaret Whiting, and Johnny Mathis. He made recordings with Ella Fitzgerald during the late 1950s and early ’60s; Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook (1959), with arrangements by Riddle, is often cited as the best of Fitzgerald’s “songbook” albums.
Riddle collaborated with Frank Sinatra over the course of more than 25 years. In one of the most-acclaimed musical partnerships of the 20th century, Sinatra and Riddle released classic albums of swing (Songs for Swingin’ Lovers! [1956], A Swingin’ Affair! [1957]) and ballads (In the Wee Small Hours [1955], Only the Lonely [1958]) that were regarded as benchmark achievements in the careers of both men. Riddle’s up-tempo arrangements were characterized by his “heartbeat rhythm,” which he explained as “the tempo that strikes people the easiest because, without their knowing it, they move to that pace all their waking hours.” His ballad arrangements were noted for their contrapuntal melodies, complex harmonies, and recurring musical motifs.
Riddle had a few instrumental hits of his own, including “Lisbon Antigua” (1956) and the theme from the television series Route 66 (1960). He also wrote the theme to TV’s The Untouchables (1959) and did the musical scoring and conducting for such series as Naked City (1958–64), Batman (1966–68), and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (1967–70). In the late 1970s Riddle arranged three best-selling albums of standards for singer Linda Ronstadt; these were regarded as a catalyst for the revival of classic American popular music. Riddle also arranged and conducted the orchestras for the inaugural balls of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.
