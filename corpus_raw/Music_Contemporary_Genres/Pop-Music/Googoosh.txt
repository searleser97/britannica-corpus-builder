Googoosh, original name Faegheh Atashin,  (born May 5, 1950, Tehrān, Iran), Iranian singer and actress who was one of Iran’s most popular and enduring entertainers despite being banned from performing for some 20 years following the Iranian Revolution (1978–79).
Called “Googoosh” from birth, she began singing and acting at a young age, performing with her father, an entertainer, when she was a toddler and making her first film at age seven. She later appeared in such movies as Partgahe makhouf (1963; Cliff of Fear), Sheitune bala (1965; The Naughty One), Panjereh (1970; “The Window”), and Bītā (1972). In the 1970s Googoosh was at the height of her film and music career and was widely emulated by Iranian women; in addition to listening to her music, they copied her clothing (miniskirts) and her short haircut (known as the “Googooshy”). In 1979, however, Iran was declared an Islamic republic, and a number of cultural restrictions were introduced; women were no longer allowed to sing in public, and pop music was banned. Although most Iranian performers chose to leave the country, Googoosh, who was visiting the United States at the time of the revolution, returned home. She was jailed briefly and thereafter led a reclusive life.
Bootleg recordings and videos remained readily available in Iran, however, and Googoosh continued to acquire fans. Following the election of President Mohammad Khatami in 1997, many restrictions began to be lifted. Some women (Googoosh was not among them) were allowed to sing in public to all-female audiences, and, while distributing pop music was still officially illegal, possession of it was permitted. In 2000 Googoosh finally was granted a passport and allowed to leave the country for the first time since the revolution. That year she staged her first world tour, which began in Toronto, where she settled for a time before moving to Los Angeles. Googoosh’s later recordings include Zoroaster (2000), Last News (2004), Manifest (2006), Shab-e Sepīd (2008), Ḥajm-e Sabz (2010), Eʿjāz (2012), and ʿAks-e Khoṣūṣī (2015). She continued to perform throughout the world, undertaking a tour (2015–16) related to her 2015 album release that took her to Canada, Turkey, Australia, Germany, and across the United States.
