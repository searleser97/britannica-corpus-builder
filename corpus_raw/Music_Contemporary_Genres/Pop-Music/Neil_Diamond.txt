Neil Diamond, in full Neil Leslie Diamond,  (born January 24, 1941, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.), American singer-songwriter. He began his career writing pop songs for other musicians and then launched a solo recording career that spanned more than five decades.
Diamond’s interest in music began at age 16, when he obtained his first guitar. After graduating from high school, Diamond attended New York University with the intention of entering medical school. However, he left college during his final year to take a job as a staff songwriter for the Sunbeam Music Company. His tenure at Sunbeam was short, and he became one of a stable of songwriters who worked out of New York’s famed Brill Building.
In 1965 Diamond signed a recording contract with Bang Records, and one year later his debut album, The Feel of Neil, was released. Shortly thereafter he wrote the song “I’m a Believer” (1966), recorded and made famous by the Monkees. In 1967 Diamond signed a new recording contract with Uni Records, with whom he recorded such hits as “Brother Love’s Traveling Salvation Show” (1969), “Sweet Caroline” (1969), “Cracklin’ Rosie” (1970), “I Am…I Said” (1971), and “Song Sung Blue” (1972).
After leaving Uni for Columbia Records, Diamond recorded the sound track for the film Jonathan Livingston Seagull (1973), which earned him a Grammy Award. He went on to release a string of successful albums during the 1970s, including Serenade (1974), Beautiful Noise (1976), Love at the Greek (1977), You Don’t Bring Me Flowers (1978; featuring a duet with Barbra Streisand on the title track), and September Morn (1979).
In 1980 Diamond made his motion picture debut: he starred in a remake of the film The Jazz Singer, for which he also wrote and performed the sound track. Notable later albums include Heartlight (1982), Live in America (1994), In My Lifetime (1996), and The Neil Diamond Collection (1999). In the early 21st century Diamond released, among other albums, The Essential Neil Diamond (2001), Stages (2003), 12 Songs (2005), Home Before Dark (2008), and Melody Road (2014). He also made a cameo appearance as himself in the film Saving Silverman (2001). In January 2018, following a diagnosis of Parkinson disease, Diamond announced his retirement from touring.
Diamond was honoured twice by the Songwriters’ Hall of Fame—first upon his induction in 1984 and later in 2000, when he was presented with the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. Diamond also received a Kennedy Center Honor (2011) and  a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement (2018).
