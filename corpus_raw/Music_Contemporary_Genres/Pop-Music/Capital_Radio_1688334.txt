The launch of London’s Capital Radio in October 1973 came some 16 years after the British government had outlawed the previous batch of commercial stations, the so-called pirates, whose staff and style had been recruited and diluted to shape Radio 1, the British Broadcasting Corporation’s new outlet. However, if those who had campaigned for a legitimate commercial radio network in the United Kingdom were expecting the flagship of Independent Local Radio to rehoist the Jolly Roger, they were soon disabused by the slick, seamless—and advertiser-friendly—format of daytime programming that relegated non-Top 40 musical “specialisms” to the evenings and weekends, alongside current affairs, drama, and the weekly concert of classical music that the station’s license demanded.
Capital nevertheless made rapid inroads into Radio 1’s listenership and created the breakfast-show (a morning drive-time program) blueprint—first with Kenny Everett and then with Chris Tarrant—that all British stations have followed. The station also nurtured such talent as Richard Allinson, Nicky Campbell, Roger Scott, and Mike Smith. The splitting of FM and AM frequencies in the late 1980s introduced two separate stations, Capital FM (contemporary hits) and AM’s Capital Gold (oldies), and the reach of the Capital Radio Group was later extended by the acquisition of stations in southern England, the Midlands, and Wales.
