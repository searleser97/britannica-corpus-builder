Johnny Otis, original name John Alexander Veliotes,  (born December 28, 1921, Vallejo, California, U.S.—died January 17, 2012, Altadena, California), American bandleader, drummer, vibraphonist, singer, producer, and promoter of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Otis was instrumental in furthering the careers of a number of important rhythm-and-blues performers.
While growing up as part of a Greek immigrant family in Berkeley, California, Otis began a lifelong attraction and commitment to African American culture. He celebrated the vibrancy of African American music and its power to unite people across racial boundaries, coming to think of himself as “black by persuasion.” Otis dropped out of school to play with bands throughout the Midwest and settled in Los Angeles in 1943. He performed with Charlie Parker, Lester Young, Count Basie, and Art Tatum, but his main impact was in rhythm and blues. He discovered and promoted Big Mama Thornton (on whose “Hound Dog” record [1952] he played drums), Little Willie John, and Little Esther Phillips; he also had a hand in developing the careers of Hank Ballard and Jackie Wilson. As leader of his own band, Otis had 15 Top 40 rhythm-and-blues hits from 1950 to 1952; his biggest success was with “Willie and the Hand Jive” in 1958. An artist, pastor, civil rights activist, and author, Otis wrote Listen to the Lambs (1968), an insightful account of the 1965 Watts riots, and Upside Your Head! Rhythm and Blues on Central Avenue (1993). In 1994 Otis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
