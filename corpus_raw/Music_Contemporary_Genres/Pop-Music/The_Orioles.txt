The Orioles,  American vocal group of the late 1940s and early ’50s. The members were Sonny Til (byname of Earlington Carl Tilghman; b. August 18, 1925, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.—d. December 9, 1981, Washington, D.C.), Alexander Sharp (b. December 1919, Baltimore—d. January 1970),  George Nelson (b. 1925, Baltimore—d. 1959), Johnny Reed (b. c. 1929, Baltimore—d. June 18, 2005, Lakewood, New Jersey), and Tommy Gaither (b. c. 1919, Baltimore—d. November 5, 1950, Baltimore).
Formed in Baltimore in 1947, the Orioles are often cited as the first vocal group to sing in the rhythm-and-blues (R&B) style, which they accomplished by taking the prevailing vocal pop style of the Ink Spots and adding a more rhythmic and rocking approach. Following their success, vocal groups with ornithological names became a staple of rhythm and blues.
An appearance on Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts television show in 1948 led to a recording contract for the Orioles. Their first recording, “It’s Too Soon to Know,” a slow romantic ballad, launched their career spectacularly by going to number one on the rhythm-and-blues chart. Most of the group’s records also were quiet ballads that featured Til’s heartfelt lead vocal supported by soft choruses sung by the rest of the group and almost imperceptible instrumental accompaniment. Their most notable records were “Tell Me So” (1949), “Crying in the Chapel” (1953), and “In the Mission of St. Augustine” (1953). The group disbanded in 1955, by which time they had been all but forgotten as pioneers. Later generations, however, would recognize the group not only as pioneers in rhythm and blues but also as roots artists of rock and roll whose influence on the doo-wop vocal groups of the 1950s and ’60s was considerable. The Orioles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.
