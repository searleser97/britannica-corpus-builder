Del Shannon, original name Charles Weedon Westover,  (born Dec. 30, 1934, Coopersville, Mich., U.S.—died Feb. 8, 1990, Santa Clarita, Calif.), American singer, songwriter, and guitarist who was one of the first white rock and rollers to write his own songs. He is best known for the pop music classic “Runaway” (1961).
After playing in bands as a teenager in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Shannon released his first single, “Runaway,” in 1961. Punctuated by his trademark falsetto cries, this ode to lost love (a common theme in Shannon’s songs) topped the charts. A series of hits quickly followed: “Hats Off to Larry,” “So Long Baby,” “Hey! Little Girl” (all 1961), “Little Town Flirt” (1963), “Keep Searchin’ (We’ll Follow the Sun)” (1964), and “Stranger in Town” (1965). All were marked by simple, ringing chord changes and Shannon’s gravelly, vibrant baritone, always ready to ascend into higher registers of longing and hurt. Shannon also wrote “I Go to Pieces,” a 1965 hit for the British duo Peter and Gordon, and endured a misguided attempt by producer Snuff Garrett and arranger Leon Russell to make him into a teen idol. Between battles with alcoholism in the 1970s, he recorded with Electric Light Orchestra and Dave Edmunds. Drop Down and Get Me (1982), a strong album and a modest chart success, was produced by Tom Petty and featured his band, the Heartbreakers.
Following the death of Roy Orbison in 1988, it was rumoured that Shannon would be asked to replace Orbison in the Traveling Wilburys; however, Shannon—always something of a haunted figure—committed suicide in 1990. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999.
