Donovan, in full Donovan Phillip Leitch,  (born May 10, 1946, Glasgow, Scotland), Scottish singer-songwriter who had consistent commercial success with his playful pop songs in the mid- to late 1960s.
Looking and sounding like Bob Dylan, Donovan emerged in 1965 as a folksinger with “Catch the Wind.” As the musical landscape became more kaleidoscopic, Donovan adapted his approach and helped define the era with odes to the hippie lifestyle such as “Sunshine Superman” (1966), “Mellow Yellow” (1967), and “Hurdy Gurdy Man” (1968). His obscure lyrics, often laced with drug references, were sung in a soft and sometimes soulful voice over melodies influenced by folk, blues, jazz, and Indian music. In the 1970s Donovan recorded several film sound tracks and continued to release albums sporadically into the 21st century. Notable recordings during this period were Sutras (1996), a folk album produced by Rick Rubin that recalled Donovan’s earliest work, and Beat Cafe (2004), a lyrically clever collection that evoked the coffeehouse atmosphere of the Beat era. In 2012 Donovan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
