Judy Collins, in full Judy Marjorie Collins,  (born May 1, 1939, Seattle, Wash., U.S.), American folk and pop singer-songwriter known for her soaring soprano, eclectic repertoire, and political activism.
A classically trained pianist and self-taught guitarist, Collins performed in folk clubs and coffeehouses from 1959, popularizing works by such songwriters as Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, and Joni Mitchell. She also had great success with cabaret and theatrical songs by Jacques Brel, Kurt Weill, Stephen Sondheim, and Randy Newman. Her biggest hits included Mitchell’s “Both Sides Now,” Sondheim’s “Send in the Clowns,” a haunting a cappella version of the spiritual “Amazing Grace,” and “Farewell to Tarwathie,” a Scottish whaling song accompanied by recordings of humpback whales. Noted for her beauty, especially her startling blue eyes, Collins was reportedly the inspiration for “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,” a hit song by Crosby, Stills, and Nash.
