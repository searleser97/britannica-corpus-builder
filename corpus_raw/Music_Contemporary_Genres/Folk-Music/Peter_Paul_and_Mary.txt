Peter, Paul and Mary,  American folksingers at the forefront of the folk music revival of the 1960s who created a bridge between traditional folk music and later folk rock. The group comprised Peter Yarrow (b. May 31, 1938, New York, New York, U.S.), Paul (in full Noel Paul) Stookey (b. November 30, 1937, Baltimore, Maryland), and Mary Allin Travers (b. November 9, 1936, Louisville, Kentucky—d. September 16, 2009, Danbury, Connecticut).
After meeting in New York City’s Greenwich Village, Yarrow, Stookey, and Travers formed a group in 1961. Playing in folk clubs and on college campuses, they built a youthful following with their lyricism, tight harmonies, and spare sound, usually accompanied only by Yarrow and Stookey on acoustic guitars. With their records and television appearances, they popularized both new and traditional folk songs by such songwriters as Woody Guthrie (“This Land Is Your Land”), the Weavers (“If I Had a Hammer”), Bob Dylan (“Blowin’ in the Wind”), and Laura Nyro (“And When I Die”).
Prominent in the civil rights movement and the struggle against the Vietnam War, Peter, Paul and Mary included protest songs in a repertoire that also featured plaintive ballads and children’s songs such as Yarrow’s “Puff (the Magic Dragon),” which often is mistakenly interpreted as drug-related. After splitting up in 1970 to pursue solo careers, the trio re-formed to release the album Reunion in 1978. In 1986 they celebrated their 25th anniversary with a series of concerts and released the album No Easy Walk to Freedom. During the course of their career, Peter, Paul and Mary received five Grammy Awards, with multiple wins for “If I Had a Hammer” (1962) and “Blowin’ in the Wind” (1963). They also earned a Grammy for the children’s recording Peter, Paul and Mommy (1969). Their final studio album, In These Times, appeared in 2003.
