Richard Dyer-Bennet,  (born October 6, 1913, Leicester, Leicestershire, England—died December 14, 1991, Monterey, Massachusetts, U.S.), British-born American tenor and guitarist who helped to revive the popularity of folk music through his concert performances, recordings, compositions, and teaching.
Though born in England, Dyer-Bennet grew up in Canada and California and attended the University of California at Berkeley (1932–35), where he studied English and music. (He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1935.) After visiting Swedish folklorist Sven Scholander in 1935, Dyer-Bennet adopted Scholander’s trinity of song interpretation—poetry, melody, and lute accompaniment. In 1944, though, he switched to the Spanish guitar and gave the first of what would become annual solo concerts at New York City’s Town Hall; the impresario Sol Hurok signed him for national and foreign tours for many years. He gained a cult following with his approximately 800 songs (including about 100 of his own composition) that ranged through British and French ballads, European medieval songs, Swedish shepherd tunes, and American cowboy songs. Curiously, though identified as a folk singer, he preferred the label minstrel or troubadour.
Dyer-Bennet stopped giving concerts after a stroke in 1972 limited use of his left hand. From 1970 to 1983 he taught at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
