Etta Baker, née Etta Lucille Reid,  (born March 31, 1913, Caldwell county, N.C., U.S.—died Sept. 23, 2006, Fairfax, Va.), American folk musician who influenced the folk music revival of the 1950s and ’60s with her mastery of East Coast Piedmont blues, a unique fingerpicking style of guitar-playing that is common to the Appalachian Mountains, especially areas of Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia.
Baker, a textile worker from a musical family, became known to a wider audience chiefly for her contributions to the folk music compilation album Instrumental Music of the Southern Appalachians (1956). Although her performance on that album widely influenced musicians such as Bob Dylan and Taj Mahal, not until after her husband’s death and her retirement from the textile mill did she begin to appear at folk festivals and concerts. In 1991 she was awarded a folk heritage fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, and she released her first studio album, One-Dime Blues, that year. It was named for and featured the song she made famous on the 1956 album. She followed that album with Railroad Bill (1999) and a collaborative recording, Etta Baker with Taj Mahal (2004). Baker continued performing live well past her 90th birthday.
