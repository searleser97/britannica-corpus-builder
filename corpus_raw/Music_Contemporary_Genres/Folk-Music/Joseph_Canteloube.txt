Joseph Canteloube,  (born October 21, 1879, Annonay, France—died November 4, 1957, Paris), French composer, pianist, and folk-song collector best known for his compositions that evoke the landscape of his native region.
Cantaloube studied with Vincent d’Indy from 1901; under this influence he traveled through France collecting folk songs, making arrangements of many of them for voice and instrumental accompaniment, and publishing them. Of these arrangements the most widely admired are the Chants d’Auvergne (1923–30), scored for voice with orchestra.
Although his folk-song settings have won a degree of popularity, Canteloube’s original works, which include the operas Le Mas and Vercingétorix (performed at the Paris Opéra in 1929 and 1933, respectively), have been neglected. He also edited the Anthologie des chants populaires français (1939–44).
