Joan Baez, in full Joan Chandos Baez,  (born January 9, 1941, Staten Island, New York, U.S.), American folksinger and political activist who interested young audiences in folk music during the 1960s. Despite the inevitable fading of the folk music revival, Baez continued to be a popular performer into the 21st century. By touring with younger performers throughout the world and staying politically engaged, she reached a new audience both in the United States and abroad. Her sense of commitment and unmistakable voice continued to win acclaim.
The daughter of a physicist of Mexican descent whose teaching and research took him to various communities in New York, California, and elsewhere, Baez moved often and acquired little formal musical training. Her first instrument was the ukulele, but she soon learned to accompany her clear soprano voice on the guitar. Her first solo album, Joan Baez, was released in 1960. Although some considered her voice too pretty, her youthful attractiveness and activist energy put her in the forefront of the 1960s folk music revival, popularizing traditional songs through her performances in coffeehouses, at music festivals, and on television and through her record albums, which were best sellers from 1960 through 1964 and remained popular. She was instrumental in the early career of Bob Dylan, with whom she was romantically involved for several years. (Her relationship with Dylan and with her sister and brother-in-law, the folksinging duo Mimi and Richard Fariña, is chronicled in David Hajdu’s Positively 4th Street [2001].) Two of the songs with which she is most identified are her 1971 cover of the Band’s “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” and her own “Diamonds and Rust,” which she recorded on her acclaimed album of the same name, issued in 1975.
An active participant in the 1960s protest movement, Baez made free concert appearances for UNESCO, civil rights organizations, and anti-Vietnam War rallies. In 1964 she refused to pay federal taxes that went toward war expenses, and she was jailed twice in 1967. The following year she married David Harris, a leader in the national movement to oppose the draft who served nearly two years in prison for refusing to comply with his draft summons (they divorced in 1973). Baez was in Hanoi in December 1972, delivering Christmas presents and mail to American prisoners of war, when the United States targeted the North Vietnamese capital with the most intense bombing campaign of the war. The title track of her 1973 album Where Are You Now, My Son? chronicles the experience; it is a 23-minute spoken-word piece punctuated with sound clips that Baez recorded during the bombing.
Throughout the years, Baez remained deeply committed to social and political matters, lending her voice to many concerts for a variety of causes. Among her later noteworthy recordings are Very Early Joan (1982), Speaking of Dreams (1989), Play Me Backwards (1992), Gone from Danger (1997), Bowery Songs (2005), Day After Tomorrow (2008), and Whistle Down the Wind (2018). A CD/DVD set of her 75th Birthday Celebration concert was released in 2016, and she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017. Baez later received a Kennedy Center Honor (2021). She wrote Daybreak (1968), an autobiography, and a memoir titled And a Voice to Sing With (1987).
