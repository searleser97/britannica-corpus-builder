Phil Ochs,  (born December 19, 1940, El Paso, Texas, U.S.—died April 9, 1976, Far Rockaway, New York), American folksinger and songwriter best remembered for the protest songs he wrote in the 1960s on topics ranging from the Vietnam War to civil rights.
While studying journalism at the Ohio State University, Ochs became interested in the folk music of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. In 1961 he moved to New York City to pursue songwriting and performing in the hothouse environment of Greenwich Village’s folk scene. His first album, All the News That’s Fit to Sing (1964), reflected his aspirations as a “singing journalist.” A wavery tenor, Ochs employed melodic lyricism, strident leftist views, and dry wit to engage listeners. For a time he was seen as the most serious challenger to Bob Dylan as the era’s preeminent folksinger. After releasing the successful Phil Ochs in Concert album in 1966, he ventured into electric rock and nonpolitical subjects. Despite his highly regarded love song “Changes,” Ochs never gained the wide popularity he sought. Acutely depressed and creatively spent, he took his own life.
