The Kingston Trio,   American folk group that helped spark the folk music revival of the 1960s. The original members were Dave Guard (b. October 19, 1934, San Francisco, California, U.S.—d. March 22, 1991, Rollinsford, New Hampshire), Bob Shane (b. February 1, 1934, Hilo, Hawaii—d. January 26, 2020, Phoenix, Arizona), and Nick Reynolds (b. July 27, 1933, San Diego, California—d. October 1, 2008, San Diego). John Stewart (b. September 5, 1939, San Diego—d. January 19, 2008, San Diego) later replaced Guard.
Formed in San Francisco in 1957, the trio was debunked by “serious” folk musicians, but their commercial success paved the way for record-industry and audience acceptance of folk performers such as Peter, Paul and Mary and Bob Dylan. With a repertoire that drew on traditional folk material but eschewed the left-wing sympathies typical of many American folk performers in the first half of the 20th century, the trio conveyed the lighthearted optimism of mainstream Americans at the onset of the 1960s. As the social and political landscape changed, the trio’s popularity waned. Often associated with their breakthrough hit song “Tom Dooley” (1958), the group had a series of chart-topping albums—including Kingston Trio at Large (1959), Here We Go Again (1959), and String Along (1960)—before breaking up in 1967.
