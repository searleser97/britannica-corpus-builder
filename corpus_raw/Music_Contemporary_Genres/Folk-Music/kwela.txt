Kwela, (Zulu: “get up” or “climb”)  popular upbeat urban dance music of South Africa. Coined by Elkin Sithole in the 1940s to refer to choral response in Zulu vocal music, the term kwela had been broadened by the 1950s to refer to the music of street bands featuring the pennywhistle, who also performed at township dances. Subsequently one or two acoustic guitars and a string bass (and sometimes other instruments) were added. The kwela repertoire came to include North American swing music, standard from the 1950s on. In the 1950s “Spokes” Mashiyane and Lemmy (“Special”) Mabaso were well-known kwela flute and saxophone players, and the style spread to what are now Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. In 1958 the kwela song “Tom Hark” as played by Elias & His Zig Zag Jive Flutes achieved international success. During the 1960s the Malawi musicians Donald and Daniel Kachamba became prominent. Other noted kwela flute players were “Big Voice” Jack Lerole, “Sparks” Nyembe, Jerry Mlotshwa, and Abia Themba. In the late 1960s kwela was overshadowed by the urban sound known as mbaqanga, but, with the rapid expansion of interest in world music at the turn of the 21st century, kwela experienced something of a resurgence.
