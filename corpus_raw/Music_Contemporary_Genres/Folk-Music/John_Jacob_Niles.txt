John Jacob Niles,  (born April 28, 1892, Louisville, Ky., U.S.—died  March 1, 1980, Boothill Farm, near Lexington, Ky.), American folksinger, folklorist, and composer of solo and choral songs.
Niles came from a musical family. His great-grandfather was a composer, organist, and cello manufacturer; his mother, Lula Sarah Niles, taught him music theory. He was attracted to folk songs while working as a surveyor in the Appalachians, and after he served in World War I he was educated at the music conservatories in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Lyon, Fr., and at the Schola Cantorum of Paris.
In 1921 in New York City, Niles became master of ceremonies at the Silver Slipper nightclub before teaming up with Marion Kerby, with whom he toured widely in the United States and Europe as a folksinger. He made his own lutes and Appalachian dulcimers and specialized in the songs of the Appalachian Mountain region. His ballad collections frequently included material that he composed, such as “I Wonder As I Wander” and “Black Is the Color of My True Love’s Hair,” or arranged, as well as ballads transcribed directly from oral sources. His published works include Songs My Mother Never Taught Me (1929; with Douglas Moore), Songs of the Hill Folk (1934), The Shape Note Study Book (1950), and The Ballad Book of John Jacob Niles (1961). His last work (1972) was the Niles-Merton song cycles, settings of poems of the Trappist monk Thomas Merton.
