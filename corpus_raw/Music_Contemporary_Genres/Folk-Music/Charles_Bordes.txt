Charles Bordes,  (born May 12, 1863, Rochecorbon, near Vouvray, France—died  Nov. 8, 1909, Toulon), French composer, choirmaster, and musicologist who was important in reviving Renaissance polyphonic choral music.
Bordes was a pupil of the composer César Franck. In 1890 he became chapelmaster of St. Gervais in Paris, which he made a centre of the study and practice of 15th-, 16th-, and 17th-century vocal music. In 1894 Bordes, along with the organist Alexandre Guilmant and the composer Vincent d’Indy, founded in Paris the Schola Cantorum, a society that in 1896 became a school for church music with Bordes as professor. Its publication, La Tribune de St. Gervais (1895), became the main organ of French musicology. He also began publication of the Anthologie des maîtres religieux primitifs, which provided choral societies with invaluable material. By 1905 he had moved to Montpellier, where he started a provincial branch of the Schola Cantorum.
Also interested in folk song, Bordes toured the Basque country of northern Spain to collect traditional melodies, 100 of which were published in Archives de la tradition basque (1889–90). As a composer he achieved particular success with his songs. He also wrote piano music, sacred and secular choral works, a Suite basque for flute and string quartet (1887), many sacred and secular songs, and a symphonic poem for orchestra.
