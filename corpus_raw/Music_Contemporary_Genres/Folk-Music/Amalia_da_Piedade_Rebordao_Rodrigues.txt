Amália da Piedade Rebordão Rodrigues,  (born July 23, 1920, Lisbon, Port.—died Oct. 6, 1999, Lisbon), Portuguese singer whose haunting and passionate renditions of her homeland’s melancholic traditional form of music known as fado brought her international fame.
Amália, as she was known to her fans, debuted as a fadista while still a teenager. By the time she was 25, she had already launched her first international tour in Brazil and had recorded the first of an estimated 170 albums. In 1947 she starred in her first film, Capas Negras (“Black Capes”). As her fame increased, she began to stretch the traditional boundaries of fado. She incorporated Spanish and Mexican rhythms into her songs and used contemporary poets as a source for her lyrics.
Amália’s impact on Portuguese culture and contemporary artists was incalculable, although her image was somewhat tarnished after the Revolution of the Carnations (1974), when accusations arose that she had collaborated with the recently toppled dictatorship. However, news that she had secretly funded the Portuguese Communist Party during the repressive rule of António de Oliveira Salazar (1932–68) helped to restore her status as the queen of fado. In 1990 she received the Grand Cross of the Order of Santiago, Portugal’s highest honour. Amália’s death in 1999 triggered three days of official mourning in Portugal and a temporary suspension of campaigning in the country’s general elections.
