Whiskey Ring,   in U.S. history, group of whiskey distillers (dissolved in 1875) who conspired to defraud the federal government of taxes. Operating mainly in St. Louis, Mo., Milwaukee, Wis., and Chicago, Ill., the Whiskey Ring bribed Internal Revenue officials and accomplices in Washington in order to keep liquor taxes for themselves. Benjamin H. Bristow, secretary of the Treasury, organized a secret investigation that exposed the ring and resulted in 238 indictments and 110 convictions. Allegations that the illegally held tax money was to be used in the Republican Partyâ€™s national campaign for the reelection of President Ulysses S. Grant aroused the public. Though Grant was not suspected, his private secretary, Orville E. Babcock, was indicted in the conspiracy but was acquitted after Grant testified to his innocence.
