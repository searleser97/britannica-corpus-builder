Tribonian, Latin Tribonianus,  (born c. ad 475, Pamphylia?—died 545), legal authority and public official in the Byzantine Empire (eastern Roman Empire), who was the chief compiler and perhaps the initiator of the Code of Justinian, the comprehensive codification of Roman law sponsored by and named for the emperor Justinian I (reigned ad 527–565).
From 530 to 532, and from 534 until his death, Tribonian served as Justinian’s quaestor sacri palatii, a minister comparable to the late medieval English chancellor. Perhaps untruthfully, he was accused of venality in office and of religious unorthodoxy, a charge possibly based on his interest in secular philosophy and in astronomy.
A member of the imperial commission that produced the first Codex constitutionum of imperial legislation (529), Tribonian was later president of commissions that prepared the Digesta (“Digest,” also called Pandects or Pandectae; 533) and a second Codex (534). In addition, he supervised the writing of the Institutiones (“Institutes”; 533) by the law teachers Dorotheus and Theophilus. As Justinian’s legal adviser, he was doubtless responsible for the earlier Novellae constitutiones post codicum (“Novels”; 534–565), containing enactments from 534 until Justinian’s death in 565.
