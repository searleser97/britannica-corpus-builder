Thomas Todd,  (born Jan. 23, 1765, King and Queen county, Va. [U.S.]—died  Feb. 7, 1826, Frankfort, Ky.), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1807–26).
Todd was admitted to the bar in 1786 and gained his first legal and political experience as a clerk for several citizens’ conventions called by the movement to separate Kentucky from its parent state, Virginia. After Kentucky achieved statehood, Todd served as the clerk of the state Court of Appeals until being named justice of the court in 1801. In 1806 he became chief justice. Much of the caseload before the Kentucky courts concerned land titles, and Todd’s decisions served as the basis of the state’s subsequent land policies.
In 1807 President Thomas Jefferson appointed Todd to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he became a follower of Chief Justice John Marshall in constitutional construction, although he was politically a supporter of Jefferson. He rendered few opinions on the court but was an invaluable resource to it on the land laws, a major national issue during his tenure on the bench.
