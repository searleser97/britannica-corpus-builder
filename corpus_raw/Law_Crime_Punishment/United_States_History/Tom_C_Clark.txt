Tom C. Clark, in full Thomas Campbell Clark,  (born September 23, 1899, Dallas, Texas, U.S.—died June 13, 1977, New York, New York), U.S. attorney general (1945–49) and associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1949–67).
Clark studied law after serving in the U.S. Army during World War I and graduated from the University of Texas law school in 1922 to enter private practice in Dallas. He served as civil district attorney for the county and became heavily involved in Democratic Party politics. In 1937 he joined the U.S. Department of Justice as a special assistant and remained with the department for eight years, working primarily on antitrust and war-fraud cases. In 1945 President Harry S. Truman appointed him attorney general, in which capacity he gained a reputation for vigorous antisubversive programs and the broadening of FBI powers. In 1949 he was appointed to the Supreme Court by Truman. On the court he maintained his strong views on the question of subversive activities, evident in Irvine v. California (1954) and Breithaupt v. Abram (1957) as well as in his dissents in the 1960s.
Although often at odds with the liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren, Clark was nonetheless a frequent supporter of civil liberties. In the famous Mapp v. Ohio (1961) decision, Clark wrote the majority opinion that evidence obtained by illegal seizure could not be used in state courts, thereby greatly broadening the constitutional protection available to defendants. In School District of Abington v. Schempp (1963), Clark wrote the majority opinion that prohibited the reading of the Bible in public schools. His three 1964 civil rights opinions, Anderson v. Martin, Heart of Alabama Motel, Inc. v. United States, and Hamm v. Rock Hill, provided the foundation for many subsequent civil rights legal battles. Clark resigned from the court in 1967 upon the appointment of his son, Ramsey Clark, as attorney general.
