John Blair,  (born 1732, Williamsburg, Virginia [U.S.]—died August 31, 1800, Williamsburg, Virginia, U.S.), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1790–96).
A member of one of Virginia’s most prominent landed families and a close friend of George Washington, Blair studied law at the Middle Temple in London and in 1766 was elected to represent William and Mary College in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He served in the Burgesses until 1770, and then for five years he was clerk of the royal governor’s Council.
In 1776 he took part in the convention to frame a constitution and plan of government for the new commonwealth of Virginia and was elected to the state Privy Council. In 1778 he was elected one of the judges of the state General Court and later became its chief justice. He subsequently served as a judge of the High Court of Chancery and was a judge of the Court of Appeals when it heard the case of Commonwealth of Virginia v. Caton in 1782. He sided with the majority when it laid down the principle that a court can annul a law deemed to conflict with the constitution. Blair took part in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, and in 1789 he was appointed by President Washington to the U.S. Supreme Court (taking his oath of office the following year). He was a judicial conservative and served on the court until his retirement in 1796.
