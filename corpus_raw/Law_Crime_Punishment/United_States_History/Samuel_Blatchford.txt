Samuel Blatchford,  (born March 9, 1820, New York City—died  July 7, 1893, Newport, R.I., U.S.), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1882–93).
Blatchford graduated from Columbia College (later Columbia University) in 1837 and served as private secretary to William H. Seward until attaining his majority. In 1842 he was admitted to the bar and began to practice with his father. He later practiced with Seward and subsequently started his own firm in New York City, becoming a noted authority on international and maritime law.
In 1867 he was appointed district judge of the southern district in New York and five years later was made a circuit judge for the second judicial district. He was elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court by Pres. Chester A. Arthur in 1882 and gained a reputation as one of the most hardworking justices, giving opinions in 430 cases. He notably gave the opinion of the majority in Cunningham v. Neagle, a case that extended federal authority. Moreover, Blatchford’s decisions on the status of design patents and his rulings regarding the infringement of design formed the basis for legislation passed by Congress in 1887 to provide remedies for patent infringement.
