Ward Hunt,  (born June 14, 1810, Utica, N.Y., U.S.—died  March 24, 1886, Washington, D.C.), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1873–82).
Admitted to the bar in 1831, Ward quickly developed a successful practice. He was elected to the state legislature as a Jacksonian Democrat in 1838 and served as mayor of Utica in 1844. His opposition to the annexation of Texas and the extension of slavery led to his support of the Free-Soil ticket in 1848. In 1856 he helped organize the Republican Party in New York state.
He was elected in 1865 as a Republican to the state Court of Appeals. He served as chief judge of that court and then, after the judicial reorganization of 1869, as commissioner of appeals. In 1872 he was named by President Ulysses S. Grant to the U.S. Supreme Court. He served without special distinction until incapacitated by a stroke in 1879, but he refused to retire until he was granted full retirement pay by a special act of Congress in 1882.
