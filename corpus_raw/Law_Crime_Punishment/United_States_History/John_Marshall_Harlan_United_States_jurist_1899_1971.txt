John Marshall Harlan,  (born May 20, 1899, Chicago—died  Dec. 29, 1971, Washington, D.C.), U.S. Supreme Court justice from 1955 to 1971.
He was the grandson of John Marshall Harlan, who sat on the Supreme Court from 1877 to 1911. The younger John Marshall graduated from Princeton University in 1920, took his master’s degree from the University of Oxford in 1923, and received his law degree from the New York Law School in 1924, being admitted to the bar the following year. He then practiced law and held several public posts, served in the Army Air Forces during World War II, and resumed his prestigious law practice after the war. In 1954 he was appointed judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and a few months later Eisenhower appointed him to the Supreme Court.
Harlan proved to be a conscientious and firmly independent member of the Court who was noted for his lucid, closely reasoned opinions. He believed in maintaining a strict dividing line between federal and state authority and opposed the tendency of the Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren to intrude into what Harlan considered matters not under its strictly constitutional purview. This stance earned him the reputation of a conservative, despite the moderate cast of some of his opinions.
