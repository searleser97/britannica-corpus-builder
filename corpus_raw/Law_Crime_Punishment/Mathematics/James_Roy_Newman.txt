James Roy Newman,  (born 1907, New York City, N.Y., U.S.—died 1966, Washington, D.C.), American lawyer, best known for his monumental four-volume historical survey of mathematics, The World of Mathematics (1956).
Newman earned a law degree from Columbia University in New York City and served with various U.S. government agencies. He helped to write the bill that placed atomic development under civilian control.
In 1946 Newman was awarded a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation, which enabled him to devote more time to producing The World of Mathematics. The volumes contain historical research papers and essays, as well as commentaries by Newman. His other publications include Mathematics and the Imagination (1940), with American mathematician Edward Kasner; What Is Science? (1955); Gödel’s Proof (1958), with American philosopher Ernest Nagel; and Science and Sensibility (1961). Two chapters from Mathematics and the Imagination, “New Names for Old” and “Beyond the Googol,” are included in Encyclopædia Britannica’s Gateway to the Great Books (1963).
