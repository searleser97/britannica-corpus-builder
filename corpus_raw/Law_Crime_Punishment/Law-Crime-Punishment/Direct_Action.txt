Direct Action, French Action Directe,  French clandestine extremist group that emerged in 1979 and is believed to have been an amalgam of earlier groups. Sometimes compared with older radical and militant groups such as the Italian Red Brigades and the German Red Army Faction, Direct Action was said to subscribe to an ideology described variously as communist, anarchist, or Maoist, with strong sympathies for Third World aspirations. Among its founders are thought to be Jean-Marc Rouillan, Nathalie Menigon, Régis Schleicher, and André Oliver. These four were among 20 Direct Action members arrested in 1986–87. Eighteen members of the group were convicted in 1988 on charges of criminal conspiracy.
Under official ban by the French government since 1982, Direct Action made bomb or gunfire attacks on various “capitalist” targets, such as employers’ association offices and factories, and various public targets, such as police stations, magistrate courts, and military sites. In addition to carrying out more than 80 bombings, the group assassinated such public figures as Georges Besse, chairman of the Renault automobile company (1986), and René Audran, an official of the French Defense Ministry (1985). It engaged in a number of anti-Jewish raids, including a machine-gun and grenade attack against a Jewish restaurant.
