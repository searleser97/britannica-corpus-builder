Brownsville Affair,  (1906), racial incident that grew out of tensions between whites in Brownsville, Texas, U.S., and Black infantrymen stationed at nearby Fort Brown. About midnight, August 13–14, 1906, rifle shots on a street in Brownsville killed one white man and wounded another. White commanders at Fort Brown believed all the Black soldiers were in their barracks at the time of the shooting; but the city’s mayor and other whites asserted that they had seen Black soldiers on the street firing indiscriminately, and they produced spent shells from army rifles to support their statements. Despite evidence that the shells had been planted as part of a frame-up, investigators accepted the statements of the mayor and the white citizens.
When the Black soldiers insisted that they had no knowledge of the shooting, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered 167 Black infantrymen discharged without honour because of their conspiracy of silence. His action caused much resentment among Blacks and drew some criticism from whites, but a U.S. Senate committee, which investigated the episode in 1907–08, upheld Roosevelt’s action.
The Brownsville Affair has ever since been a matter of controversy, and with the rise of the civil rights movement it became a matter of embarrassment to the army. After the publication in 1970 of John D. Weaver’s The Brownsville Raid, which argued that the discharged soldiers had been innocent, the army conducted a new investigation and, in 1972, reversed the order of 1906.
