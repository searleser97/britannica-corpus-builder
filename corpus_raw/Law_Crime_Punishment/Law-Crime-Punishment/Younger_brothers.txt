Younger Brothers,  four Midwestern American outlaws of the post-Civil War era—Thomas Coleman (“Cole”; 1844–1916), John (1846–74); James (“Jim”; 1850–1902), and Robert (“Bob”; 1853–89)—who were often allied with Jesse James.
As youngsters in Lee’s Summit, Mo., the Youngers were witness to the bloody Kansas–Missouri border skirmishes and then the strife of the Civil War. Cole Younger joined William C. Quantrill’s raiders, Confederate guerrillas and near-outlaws, and met Frank James, another member. After the war, in 1866, Cole joined Jesse and Frank James and other outlaws in a gang robbing banks in Missouri and in surrounding states. Jim Younger joined them in 1868, John Younger about a year later, and Bob Younger about 1872. The next summer the gang added train robberies to their derring-do.
By this time, Pinkerton agents and Missouri sheriffs had been long in pursuit. In March 1874 three of them found John and Jim Younger and killed John in a shootout.
The three remaining Youngers reached the end of their career on Sept. 7, 1876, when, with Frank and Jesse James and three others, they attempted to rob the First National Bank of Northfield, Minn. Leaving the bank, they were met by the gunfire of a mob of citizens, who pursued them as they fled into nearby swamps. Three of the gang (Clell Miller, Bill Chadwell, and Charlie Pitts) were killed. Frank and Jesse James escaped; and the Youngers, with Jim badly wounded, were captured. The three Youngers pleaded guilty to robbery and murder and were sentenced to life imprisonment. Bob died in prison of tuberculosis. Cole and Jim were granted pardons in 1901. Jim, in ill health, put a bullet through his head the following year. Cole wrote The Story of Cole Younger, by Himself (1903), played in Wild West shows and carnivals for a few years, and then retired to his hometown of Lee’s Summit, Mo., where he died of a heart attack.
