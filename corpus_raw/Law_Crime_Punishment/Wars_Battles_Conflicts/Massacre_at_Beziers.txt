Massacre at Béziers,  (21–22 July 1209). This brutal massacre was the first major battle in the Albigensian Crusade called by Pope Innocent III against the Cathars, a religious sect. The French city of Béziers, a Cathar stronghold, was burned down and 20,000 residents killed after a papal legate, the Abbot of Cîteaux, declared, "Slaughter them all!"
The Cathars—also known as "Albigensians" after the French town of Albi, sometimes identified as their headquarters—were "dualists," meaning that they believed in two gods: a greater embodiment of goodness and a less powerful evil deity that created the world. Emerging in 1000–50, they established their own church in c. 1140 and by the late twelfth century had eleven bishops in France and Italy with a large number of followers in the Languedoc region of southern France. Cathars denied the divinity of Christ and the authority of the pope; the Roman Catholic Church declared them heretics in 1176.
Pope Innocent III sent preachers to convert the Cathars, but called a crusade after his legate, Pierre of Castelnau, was killed in January 1208. Many were attracted to the crusade by Innocent’s declaration that they would be entitled to keep any land seized from heretics. In 1209 the 10,000-strong crusade army gathered in Lyon and marched south under command of another papal legate, Arnaud Amalric, Abbot of Cîteaux. Arriving at Béziers, the crusaders called for the surrender of the Cathars and local Catholics. The defenders of the city made a sortie to attack the besieging army, but were overwhelmed and the crusaders poured through the open gates of the city. The abbot wrote to the pope, "The city was put to the sword. So did God’s vengeance give vent to its wondrous rage." Nevertheless, Cathar resistance remained strong elsewhere and the crusade lasted twenty years.
Losses: Albigensian, and citizens, 20,000; Crusader, minimal of 10,000.
