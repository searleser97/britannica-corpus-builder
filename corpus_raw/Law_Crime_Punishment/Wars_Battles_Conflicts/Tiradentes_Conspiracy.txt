Tiradentes Conspiracy,  (1789), plot organized in the captaincy of Minas Gerais, Brazil, against the Portuguese colonial regime by the Brazilian patriot Joaquim José da Silva Xavier, nicknamed Tiradentes (“Tooth Puller”), because one of his occupations was dentistry. The uprising, which was a precursor of the Brazilian independence movement, was foiled when he was captured the next year; in 1792 he was executed. Silva Xavier is revered as a martyr of Brazilian independence. Tiradentes Day (April 21), a national holiday in Brazil, is observed in his honour.
