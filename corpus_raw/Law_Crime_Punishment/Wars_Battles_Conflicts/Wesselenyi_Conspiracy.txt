Wesselényi Conspiracy,   (c. 1664–71), group of Hungarians, organized by Ferenc Wesselényi, that unsuccessfully plotted to overthrow the Habsburg dynasty in Hungary; its efforts resulted in the establishment of an absolutist, repressive regime in Hungary.
When the Habsburg emperor Leopold I (reigned 1658–1705) ceded a large portion of Hungarian land to the Ottoman Turks (1664; Treaty of Vasvár), he provoked the opposition of many previously pro-Habsburg Hungarian Roman Catholic magnates, including the palatine administrator Ferenc Wesselényi; the bán (governor) of Croatia, Péter Zrínyi; the chief justice of Hungary, Ferenc Nádasdy; and Ferenc Rákóczi. They formed a conspiracy to free Hungary from Habsburg rule and secretly negotiated for assistance from France and Turkey.
Finally in 1670 Zrínyi received some encouragement from the sultan and prepared to march into Styria. Rákóczi, believing rumours that a formal alliance had been concluded, also assembled his forces and arrested Count Rüdiger von Starhemberg, the imperial commander in the northern Hungarian city of Tokay. The Turks’ chief interpreter, however, had revealed the plot to Habsburg officials in Vienna. Imperial troops rescued Starhemberg and easily dispersed the rebels. Several leaders were tried for high treason by an Austrian court, and Zrínyi, Nádasdy, and two others were executed (April 30, 1671). Wesselényi had earlier died of natural causes, and Rákóczi was fined.
Special commissions, set up throughout Habsburg Hungary, arrested about 2,000 nobles, accused them of participating in the conspiracy, and confiscated their estates. In addition, Leopold’s advisers concluded that, by conspiring against the regime, the Hungarian nation had forfeited its special rights and privileges and had become subject to the emperor’s absolute rule.
