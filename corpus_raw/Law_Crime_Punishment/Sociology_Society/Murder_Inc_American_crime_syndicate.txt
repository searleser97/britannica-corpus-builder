Murder, Inc.,,   in popular usage, an arm of the American national crime syndicate, founded in the 1930s to threaten, maim, or murder designated victims for a price; the organization lacked an official name. Murder, Inc., was headed by Louis “Lepke” Buchalter and later by Albert Anastasia, and its services were available to any syndicate member anywhere in the country. Most victims of Murder, Inc., were themselves syndicate members or persons otherwise associated with criminal activities who were killed for “business reasons.”
In 1940–41 the organization was exposed by a former member, Abe “Kid Twist” Reles, who turned police informer and described, in detail, some 70 murders and suggested hundreds more. He also offered information on scores of hoodlums who specialized in murder, assault, and intimidation. As a result, Buchalter and several of the most important assassins were convicted and executed. The organization continued, however, under the direction of Anastasia.
The business involved a special argot: the assignment to murder was a “contract,” the killing a “hit,” and the victim a “bum,” or a “mark.”
In the 1920s and early 1930s, Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel dealt in murder-for-hire in the New York area; the nationwide Murder, Inc., may have been a continuation of this earlier organization. Siegel was a leading hit man in Murder, Inc.
