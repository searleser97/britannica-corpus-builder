Albert Cohen,  (born June 15, 1918, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.â€”died November 25, 2014, Chelsea, Massachusetts), American criminologist best known for his subcultural theory of delinquent gangs. In 1993 Cohen received the Edwin H. Sutherland Award from the American Society of Criminology for his outstanding contributions to criminological theory and research.
Cohen earned an M.A. in sociology from Indiana University (1942) and a Ph.D. in sociology from Harvard University (1951). In 1965, after having taught at Indiana University for 18 years, he joined the faculty of the University of Connecticut, where he served as professor of sociology until his retirement in 1988.
As a graduate student, Cohen studied under Edwin H. Sutherland and Robert K. Merton, who had developed the two leading theories in criminology, on normal learning and social structure, respectively. In Delinquent Boys: The Culture of the Gang (1955), Cohen tied these divergent approaches together in a single theory. Proposing a general theory of subcultures, Cohen argued that similar ideas tend to arise among people who experience similar social circumstances. He maintained that delinquent youths generally lack the means to achieve social status along conventional lines, and in response they form groups (gangs) that invert the conventional expectations in terms of which status is achieved. For example, whereas conventional society confers status for academic achievement, gangs confer status for academic failure.
