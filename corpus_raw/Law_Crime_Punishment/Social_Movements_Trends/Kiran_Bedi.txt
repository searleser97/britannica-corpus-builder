Kiran Bedi,  (born June 9, 1949, Amritsar, India),  Indian social activist who was the first woman to join the Indian Police Service (IPS) and who was instrumental in introducing prison reform in India.
Bedi was the second of four daughters. Her education included an undergraduate degree in English (1968), a master’s degree in political science (1970), a law degree (1988), and a Ph.D. in social science (1993) with a focus on drug abuse and domestic violence. She joined the IPS in 1972 and went on to serve a variety of roles, including narcotics officer, antiterrorist specialist, and administrator.
Bedi earned recognition for the work she did as inspector general of prisons, beginning in 1994. In that capacity she reshaped one of the largest prisons in the world—the Tihar prison complex, in Delhi—by addressing the corruption and human rights abuses she found there. She targeted sanitation and nutrition problems at Tihar and also implemented new literacy and drug treatment programs there.
In 2003 Bedi became the first woman and the first Indian to be appointed United Nations civilian police adviser. She also founded two voluntary nongovernmental organizations, Navjyoti (1988) and India Vision Foundation (1994), both of which were established to operate primary education and adult literacy programs and to offer vocational training and counseling services for women, as well as to provide drug rehabilitation for prisoners. She was the recipient of numerous awards in India and abroad. She was also an accomplished tennis player and won several Asian championships.
In 2016 Bedi was appointed lieutenant governor of Puducherry union territory.
