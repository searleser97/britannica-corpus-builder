Phoenix Park murders,   (May 6, 1882), an assassination in Dublin that involved the stabbing of the British chief secretary of Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish, and his under secretary, T.H. Burke. The chief secretary had arrived in Dublin only that day and was walking in the cityâ€™s Phoenix Park in the evening when set upon by members of a nationalist secret society, the Invincibles.
The event occurred just after Charles Stewart Parnell, leader of the Irish Home Rule Party in the British House of Commons, was released from Kilmainham jail, Dublin, where he had been confined for his violent speeches against the Land Act (1881), which he considered insufficient land-reform legislation. The result of the assassinations was a revulsion against terrorism. Parnell, who had just compromised with the British government over the land question, was consequently able to subordinate the Irish National League, a nationalist organization, to the more moderate Home Rule Party in Parliament.
