Sir Samuel Romilly,   (born March 1, 1757, London, Eng.—died  Nov. 2, 1818, London), English legal reformer whose chief efforts were devoted to lessening the severity of English criminal law. His attacks on the laws authorizing capital punishment for a host of minor felonies and misdemeanours, such as begging by soldiers and sailors without a permit, were partly successful during his lifetime and contributed to reforms carried out after his death.
Called to the bar in 1783, Romilly became known as the outstanding chancery lawyer in England and served as chancellor of Durham from 1805 to 1815. In 1806 he was appointed solicitor general, entered the House of Commons, and was knighted. Influenced by the libertarianism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, he supported the French Revolution in its early stages, though conservative reaction in England to that revolution’s excesses subsequently hindered his work. His program for the mitigation of punishment in criminal law was based in part on the criminology of Cesare Beccaria and the utilitarian philosophy of Jeremy Bentham. Distressed by the death of his wife, Romilly committed suicide in 1818. His Memoirs appeared in 1840.
