Salmon Oliver Levinson,  (born Dec. 29, 1865, Noblesville, Ind., U.S.—died  Feb. 2, 1941, Chicago, Ill.), lawyer who originated and publicized the “outlawry of war” movement in the United States.
Levinson practiced law in Chicago from 1891 and became noted for his skill in reorganizing the finances of distressed corporations. In an article in the New Republic, March 9, 1918, he argued that violence by nation-states should be declared illegal. During the waning months of World War I he was able to win leaders in many fields to his cause. Levinson later assisted in drafting the Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928), which “outlawed” war in a legal sense.
