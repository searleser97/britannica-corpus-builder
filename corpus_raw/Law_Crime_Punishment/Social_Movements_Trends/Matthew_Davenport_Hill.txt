Matthew Davenport Hill,  (born Aug. 6, 1792, Birmingham, Warwickshire, Eng.—died  June 7, 1872, Stapleton, near Bristol, Gloucestershire), British lawyer and penologist, many of whose suggested reforms in the treatment of criminals were enacted into law in England.
Hill studied law at Lincoln’s Inn, London, and was called to the bar in 1819. After a term in the House of Commons (1832–35), he was recorder (judge) of Birmingham (1839–65) and bankruptcy commissioner for the Bristol district (1851–69). He believed that crime could be prevented by reformation in prison, ending in the convict’s release on a showing of good behaviour throughout his prison term, and by life imprisonment of incorrigibles, without the possibility of parole. The 1853 and 1864 Penal Servitude Acts passed by Parliament were based on these principles. Among Hill’s books was Suggestions for the Repression of Crime (1857). His work was complemented by that of his brother Frederic Hill (1803–96), whose Crime: Its Amount, Causes, and Remedies (1853), reflected his experience as inspector of Scottish prisons.
