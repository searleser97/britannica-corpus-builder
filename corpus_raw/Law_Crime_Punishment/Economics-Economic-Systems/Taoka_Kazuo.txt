Taoka Kazuo, byname Kuma (Japanese: Bear),  (born March 28, 1912, Sanshōmura, Japan—died  July 30, 1981, Amagasaki), Japan’s major crime boss (oyabun), who, after World War II, rose to head a giant crime organization, the Yamaguchi-gumi. Though centred in Kōbe, it had interests and affiliates nationwide and consisted of more than 10,000 members (known as yakuza) divided into more than 500 bands.
Taoka was born to a poor farm family in a village on the island of Shikoku; his father died before Taoka was born, and his mother died when he was four years old. Raised by relatives, he left school in his early teens and in 1929 began associating with yakuza gangs in Kōbe; in the early 1930s he became an apprentice and then a member of Yamaguchi-gumi. During World War II the organization fell apart; Taoka restored it in the postwar years and made it into a giant cartel, dealing in extortion, labour racketeering, gambling, prostitution, loansharking, smuggling, show business, and other enterprises both legal and illegal. Ideologically he was ultrarightist and ultranationalistic.
In 1963 the National Police Agency began to regulate the Yamaguchi-gumi, and in 1966 Taoka was indicted on five counts, including blackmail. After a long legal battle, he died of a heart attack just a month before he was to be sentenced by a Kōbe district court. Earlier, in July 1978, he had survived an assassination attempt when a member of a rival gang shot him in the neck in a Kyōto nightclub.
