John Archibald Campbell,  (born June 24, 1811, Washington, Ga., U.S.—died  March 12, 1889, Baltimore, Md.), American jurist and Supreme Court justice (1853–61). He also was assistant secretary of war for the Confederacy.
At age 11 Campbell entered Franklin College (now the University of Georgia), and after graduating at age 14 he entered the U.S. Military Academy. Called home upon the death of his father, Campbell then began to study law. He was admitted to the bar at age 18 (by a special act of the legislature) and soon moved to Alabama, where he married. In addition to maintaining a large private practice, Campbell served two terms in the Alabama legislature.
At age 41 Campbell was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. He was known as a strict constructionist, and his views on states’ rights were decidedly Jeffersonian. His tenure was also notable for his concurring opinion in the Dred Scott decision, which made slavery legal in all the territories and fanned the flames of sectional controversy that led to the American Civil War. Though he opposed as imprudent the Southern states’ secession from the Union, Campbell resigned his Supreme Court appointment in 1861 and cast his lot with the South. In 1862 the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, appointed him assistant secretary of war for the Confederacy, a position that he held until the South was defeated. When he was released from Fort Pulaski, where he had been held for four months on false charges, Campbell—who had lost his possessions in the war—moved to New Orleans, La., and established a law practice there. He made his home in New Orleans for the remainder of his life, arguing a number of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.
