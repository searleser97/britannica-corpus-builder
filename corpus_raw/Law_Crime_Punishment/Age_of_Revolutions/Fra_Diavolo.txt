Fra Diavolo, byname of Michele Pezza,  (born April 7, 1771, Itri, near Formia, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies—died  Nov. 11, 1806, Naples), Italian brigand chief who repeatedly fought against the French occupation of Naples; he is celebrated as a popular guerrilla leader in folk legends and in the novels of the French writer Alexandre Dumas père.
After committing various crimes, the young Pezza joined the mountain bandits then plundering the Italian countryside. His ferocity earned him the name Fra Diavolo, or Brother Devil, among the victimized peasants. In 1798 Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, chief adviser to King Ferdinand IV of Naples, pardoned Diavolo for two murders and hired him to fight the French. Diavolo’s men disrupted the French communications but could not prevent the French capture of Naples (January 1799), which was declared the Parthenopean Republic.
Ruffo and Diavolo then went to Calabria, recruiting for their army while pillaging several towns. With the departure of the French, Ruffo, aided by Diavolo, recaptured Naples (June 1799). Encouraged by Queen Maria Carolina and the royal family’s British ally Admiral Lord Nelson, Diavolo led the barbarous reprisals against collaborators with the French. Arrested for having sacked Albano Laziale, Diavolo was pardoned by Ferdinand, who made him a colonel. After receiving a generous pension and a fief from the Queen, he lived under court protection until 1806.
Diavolo then tried to organize resistance against Napoleon’s troops, which had once again taken Naples (January 1806). When a price was put on his head, Diavolo was captured and hanged in the public marketplace.
