Antoine-Quentin Fouquier-Tinville,  (born June 10, 1746, Hérouel, Picardy, Fr.—died  May 7, 1795, Paris), French Revolutionary lawyer who was public prosecutor of the Revolutionary Tribunal during the Reign of Terror.
A friend and relative of the journalist Camille Desmoulins, Fouquier-Tinville early supported the Revolution and rose from minor legal offices to the rank of assistant public prosecutor of the criminal tribunal in Paris (1793). In March 1793 he was appointed public prosecutor of the Revolutionary Tribunal, and he became a dominant figure during the Reign of Terror. Hardworking and ruthless, he claimed to have prosecuted more than 2,400 counterrevolutionaries, including Marie-Antoinette, Desmoulins, the Girondins, and the Hébertists. After Robespierre’s fall from power, the Thermidorians tried Fouquier-Tinville and sentenced him to the guillotine. In his unsuccessful trial defense, Fouquier-Tinville denied any personal acts of violence and claimed that he had merely obeyed the orders of the Revolutionary government’s committees.
