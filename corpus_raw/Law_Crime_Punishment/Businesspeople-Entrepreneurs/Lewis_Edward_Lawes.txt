Lewis Edward Lawes,  (born Sept. 13, 1883, Elmira, N.Y., U.S.â€”died  April 23, 1947, Garrison, N.Y.), U.S. penologist whose introduction of novel penal administrative policies helped to emphasize a rehabilitative role for prisons.
Assuming the office of warden of Sing Sing State Prison (now Ossining Correctional Facility), Ossining, N.Y., in 1920, Lawes instituted such reforms as the establishment of theatricals, film showings, and athletics; the installation of workshop safety devices; and provision of radio earphones for each cell. He also required all inmates to wear the same kind of uniform in order to destroy distinctions of wealth and outside status. An unyielding foe of capital punishment, Lawes nevertheless supervised hundreds of executions. Among his books, Twenty Thousand Years in Sing Sing (1932) is the best known.
