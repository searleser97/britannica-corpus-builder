Tianjin Massacre,  (June 21, 1870), in Tianjin (Tientsin), China, violent outbreak of Chinese xenophobic sentiment that nearly precipitated international warfare and signaled the end of the “cooperative policy” between China and the Western treaty powers. Before the incident, rumours circulated in Tianjin that the French Sisters of Charity were kidnapping and mutilating Chinese children. Hostility mounted, and on June 21 the French consul, Henri Fontanier, fired into a crowd of locally prominent representatives, missing the district magistrate but killing his servant; immediately the consul and some 20 others, mostly French, were killed and mutilated by the mob.
Demands for harsh punishment issued from Paris and Rome. European warships were sent to Tianjin, and Chinese troops were activated at battle stations. Hostilities were averted only after the execution, under pressure from the Western powers, of 16 Chinese and the dispatch of an official mission to convey China’s apologies to France.
