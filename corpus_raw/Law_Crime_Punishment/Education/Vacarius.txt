Vacarius,   (born c. 1115, –20, Lombardy [Italy]—died  after 1198, England), scholar of Roman (civil) and canon law, who was, at the nascent University of Oxford and elsewhere, the first known teacher of Roman law in England. 
Educated at Bologna, Vacarius went to England to act as counsel to Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, in his successful struggle (ending in 1146) to have the papal legateship transferred from the bishop of Winchester to himself. By 1149 Vacarius had become a popular lecturer on civil law. For those of his listeners who could not afford legal training, he is said to have prepared a treatise (nine books) on the Digest, or Pandects, and Codex of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I. Known as Liber pauperum, this work became one of the chief legal texts at Oxford, where, at an uncertain date, Vacarius began to teach. Oxford students of law soon were called pauperistae, in reference to his book.
King Stephen (reigned 1135–54) tried ineffectually to suppress Vacarius’ teaching and to destroy civil and canon law books in England. After the accession of Henry II to the throne, however, Vacarius served his friend Roger of Pont l’Évêque, archbishop of York, as legal adviser, ecclesiastical judge, and envoy to the papal court. Apparently he shared Roger’s antagonism to Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury. Nothing is known of him after 1198 or 1199, when Pope Innocent III wrote to him concerning the Fourth Crusade.
