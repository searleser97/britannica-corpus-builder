Constance Mayfield Rourke,  (born Nov. 14, 1885, Cleveland—died  March 23, 1941, Grand Rapids, Mich., U.S.), U.S. historian who pioneered in the study of American character and culture.
After earning an A.B. from Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., (1907) and studying at the Sorbonne in Paris, Rourke taught English at Vassar. In 1915 she resigned, thereafter working as a research historian and free-lance writer devoted to defining the historical aspects of the American character through the interpretation of popular culture.
She is best known for American Humor: A Study of the National Character (1931). Considered a classic work of scholarship, American Humor examined both popular and elite culture and argued that American culture reflected a vital and rich tradition distinct from the European experience.
Rourke’s works include numerous magazine articles, as well as five monographs on American cultural history. Van Wyck Brooks edited her unpublished manuscripts to bring out The Roots of American Culture (1942). A biography by Joan Shelley Rubin, Constance Rourke and American Culture, was published in 1980.
