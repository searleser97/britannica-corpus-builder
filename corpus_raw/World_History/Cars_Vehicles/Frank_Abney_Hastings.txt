Frank Abney Hastings,  (born 1794—died June 1, 1828, Zacynthus, Ionian Islands [Greece]), British naval officer who fought in the War of Greek Independence and was the first commander to use a ship with auxiliary steam power in naval action.
The son of Lieutenant General Sir Charles Hastings, Frank Hastings was cashiered from the Royal Navy for a breach of discipline in 1820 and then joined the Greeks in their rebellion against Turkish rule.
To remedy the shortcomings of the outmoded Greek navy, he obtained the financial backing of Lord Byron and the London Greek Committee to buy six steam-powered warships in 1824; but only one was completed, the Karteria, which was the fastest and most modern ship in the Mediterranean at the time, with two small steam engines and an armament of four 68-pound guns featuring a method of heating and firing red-hot shells that Hastings himself had invented.
Hastings sank seven Turkish ships in the Bay of Salona, off the Gulf of Corinth, an act that forced the Egyptian-Turkish fleet to break through the allied naval blockade and suffer the defeat of Navarino on Oct. 20, 1827, resulting in Egypt’s withdrawal from the war. After Navarino, Hastings’ operations in the islands and along the coastline of the Greek mainland enabled the Greeks to expand their territory and gain important strategic points. He died as a result of wounds suffered at Anatolikón in an attempt to capture Missolonghi.
