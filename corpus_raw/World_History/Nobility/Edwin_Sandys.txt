Sir Edwin Sandys,  (born Dec. 9, 1561, Worcestershire, Eng.—died  October 1629, Kent), a leading Parliamentary opponent of King James I of England and a founder of the colony of Virginia. His activities in Parliament prepared the way for the Parliamentarian movement that eventually deposed and executed James’s successor, Charles I.
Sandys was the son of Edwin Sandys, bishop of Worcester and later archbishop of York, and the brother of the poet George Sandys. Trained in law, he entered Parliament in 1586. While traveling on the Continent from 1593 to 1599, he wrote A Relation of the State of Religion (1605), a conciliatoryanalysis of contemporary creeds. He was knighted shortly after the accession of James I, and in 1604 he was reelected to Parliament, where he unexpectedly emerged as a critic of the king, especially in opposition to royal plans for the union of England and Scotland. He earned James’s enmity by boldly expressing his belief in constitutional monarchy and rejecting the doctrine of the divine right of kings.
Sandys’ interest in overseas expansion caused him to join the Virginia Company (1607) and several other joint-stock enterprises, including the East India Company. Upon gaining control of the Virginia Company in 1619, he had a representative assembly established in Virginia—the first representative body in the North American colonies. Nevertheless, in 1624 James’s government dissolved the company.
In the 1621 Parliament, Sandys actively opposed monopolies, Roman Catholics, and the royal minister Sir Lionel Cranfield, whom he helped to impeach in the 1624 Parliament.
