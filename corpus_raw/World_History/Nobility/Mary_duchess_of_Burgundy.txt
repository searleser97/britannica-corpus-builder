Mary, also called Mary Of Burgundy,  French Marie De Bourgogne,  (born Feb. 13, 1457, Brussels—died  March 27, 1482, Brugge [Bruges], Flanders), duchess of Burgundy (1477–82), daughter and heiress of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy; her crucial marriage to the archduke Maximilian (later Maximilian I), son of the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III, resulted in Habsburg control of the Netherlands.
Betrothed to Maximilian in 1476, Mary found herself faced with French invasion when she became duchess of Burgundy on her father’s death at Nancy early in 1477. She resisted French pressure to marry the future Charles VIII and became Maximilian’s wife on August 18, 1477. Through her own marriage and the subsequent match that was made between her son, Philip the Handsome, and Joanna the Mad of Spain, daughter of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, the Netherlands came to be joined with Spain and with the Habsburg’s own Austrian possessions in the hands of her famous grandson, the emperor Charles V.
