Daniel Romanovich, byname Daniel of Galicia, Ukrainian Danylo Romanovych, Russian Danilo, or Daniil, Romanovich, or Danilo Galitsky,  (born 1201—died  1264), ruler of the principalities of Galicia and Volhynia (now in Poland and Ukraine, respectively), who became one of the most powerful princes in east-central Europe.
Son of Prince Roman Mstislavich, Daniel was only four years old when his father, who had united Galicia and Volhynia, died in a battle against the Poles (1205). Not until 1221 did Daniel begin to overthrow other pretenders to Roman’s succession and assert his authority over Volhynia; and only in 1238 did he finally gain control of Galicia. He then directed his efforts toward enriching his domain, encouraging migrants to settle there, building cities, including Lviv and Chełm, and promoting the development of a flourishing trade through his lands.
After the Mongol invasions (1240–41), however, Daniel was compelled to recognize the khan’s suzerainty. Despite his acknowledged allegiance to the khan, he developed close relations with his western neighbours, hoping thus to secure allies who would support his attempt to overthrow the Mongol overlords. To further this plan, he married his sons into the ruling houses of Hungary, Austria, and Lithuania and promised to acknowledge the pope as head of the church in his realm.
No military aid was forthcoming, however, and in 1256 Daniel launched his own campaign and drove the Mongols out of Volhynia (c. 1257). But in 1260 another Mongol force entered Volhynia and forced Daniel to destroy the fortifications he had constructed in his major cities. The invaders withdrew but asserted the permanency of their authority by leaving administrative agents to collect taxes and recruit soldiers. Daniel, giving up plans of resistance, lived the rest of his life as an obedient, if a reluctant, vassal of the khan.
