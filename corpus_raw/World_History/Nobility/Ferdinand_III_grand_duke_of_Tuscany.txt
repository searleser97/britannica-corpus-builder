Ferdinand III,   (born May 6, 1769, Florence—died  June 18, 1824, Florence), grand duke of Tuscany whose moderate, enlightened rule distinguished him from other Italian princes of his time.
He became grand duke on July 21, 1790, when his father, Leopold II, succeeded as Holy Roman emperor. He continued the liberal reforms of his father and sought to maintain a neutral position toward the French Revolution. After he had established diplomatic relations with the French Republic (1793), however, he was constrained by England to join the coalition against France. Chased from his lands by the French in 1799, he took a command in the Austrian Army and soon returned to Florence. By the Treaty of Lunéville (Feb. 9, 1801), however, the French gained Tuscany; and, as compensation, he received the principality of Salzburg, with the title of elector. He later exchanged this principality for the duchy of Würzburg (Dec. 26, 1805) and joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806.
With the defeat of Napoleon, Ferdinand recovered Tuscany (1814) but shunned the reactionary violence associated with the restoration of princely power in Italy. Instead, he concentrated on the economic, social, and cultural redevelopment of his country. Having won the confidence of his people, he succeeded in maintaining a degree of independence from Austria.
