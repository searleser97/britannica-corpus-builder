Gabrielle d’Estrées, duchess de Beaufort,  (born 1573—died  April 10, 1599, Paris), mistress of King Henry IV of France and, with him, founder of the Vendôme branch of the House of Bourbon.
The daughter of the Marquis de Coeuvres, Gabrielle met Roger de Saint-Lary, later Duke de Bellegarde, at the court of Henry III and became his mistress. Saint-Lary in turn introduced her to Henry IV, who fell in love with her; it was probably during Henry’s siege of Chartres (1591) that she became his mistress. Henry arranged a purely formal marriage for her with Nicolas d’Amerval (June 1592; annulled 1594), but this formality did not prevent him from publicly acknowledging her as his mistress in December 1592. Indeed, Henry was often accused of compromising his victories in order to visit her. She had his entire confidence and influenced him in his decision to become a Roman Catholic in the expectation that the pope would then annul his marriage to Queen Margaret.
Surrounded by a rapacious entourage, Gabrielle showed herself neither disinterested nor faithful. She bore the king three children, who were legitimized: César, Duke de Vendôme; Catherine-Henriette, Duchess d’Elbeuf; and Alexandre, Chevalier de Vendôme, later grand prior of France. In 1595, when César was legitimized, Gabrielle was made Marquise de Monceaux; later she was made Duchess de Beaufort (1597) and Duchess d’Étampes (1598). By this time Henry was master of all France. He seriously considered marrying her, despite the opposition of the Holy See and the Duke de Sully, whose protector she had been. Henry considered her to be his wife, and she looked on herself as queen of France, but she died suddenly, before any definite steps toward marriage were taken.
