Owain Cyfeiliog,   (born c. 1130—died c. 1197), Welsh warrior-prince of Powys and poet of distinct originality among the gogynfeirdd (court poets).
After ruling over the people of southern Powys from 1160 to 1195, Owain retired to the Cistercian monastery of Strata Marcella (Ystrad Marchell), which he had established in 1170. He died and was buried there, despite his previous excommunication (1188) for failing to support the Third Crusade. As prince of Powys he was known for his support for the king of England.
The poem Hirlas Owain (“The Drinking Horn of Owain”) is noteworthy for its dramatic presentation. It is set at court, where Owain’s warriors, weary from battle, are gathered at the banquet table. Each stanza begins with instructions to the cupbearer to pour a drink for a hero; he then bestows praise on the man as the drink is poured. At the beginning of the 21st century, scholars argued that this and the other poem attributed to him are in fact the work of his court poet, Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr.
