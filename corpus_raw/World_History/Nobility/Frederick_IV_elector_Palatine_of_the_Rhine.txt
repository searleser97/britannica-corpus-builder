Frederick IV, byname Frederick The Righteous,  German Friedrich Der Aufrichtige,  (born March 5, 1574, Amberg, Palatinate—died  Sept. 19, 1610, Heidelberg), elector Palatine of the Rhine, only surviving son of the elector Louis VI.
Frederick’s father died in October 1583, when the young elector came under the guardianship of his uncle John Casimir, an ardent Calvinist. In January 1592, on the death of John Casimir, Frederick undertook the government of the Palatinate and continued his uncle’s policies of hostility to the Catholic Church and the Habsburgs and cooperation with foreign Protestants. He was often in communication with Henry of Navarre, afterward Henry IV of France, and like him was unremitting in his efforts to conclude a league among the German Protestants. After many delays the Union of Evangelical Estates was actually formed in May 1608, under the leadership of the elector, and he took a prominent part in directing the operations of the union until his death. Frederick was very extravagant, and liked to surround himself with pomp and luxury.
