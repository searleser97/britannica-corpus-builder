William Parr, Marquess Northampton,  (born Aug. 14, 1513, Kendal Castle?, Westmorland, Eng.—died  Oct. 28, 1571, Warwick, Warwickshire), brother of Henry VIII’s queen Catherine Parr, and Protestant supporter of Lady Jane Grey and Queen Elizabeth I.
He took part in suppressing the uprising in the north of England in 1537 and, after serving as member of Parliament for Northamptonshire, was made Baron Parr in 1539. In December 1543, just after his sister had married the king, he was created Earl of Essex, a title formerly held by his father-in-law, Henry Bourchier, who had died in March 1540. Under Edward VI, who called him his “honest uncle,” Parr was equally prominent, being created Marquess of Northampton in 1547 and becoming lord-lieutenant of five of the eastern counties and being great chamberlain from 1550 to 1553. He favoured the claim of Lady Jane Grey to the English throne, and consequently the accession of Queen Mary I was quickly followed by his attainder (1553), with loss of his titles. Although sentenced to death he was pardoned and released from prison at the end of 1553. After enjoying the favour of Queen Elizabeth I, he was re-created Marquess of Northampton in 1559. The title became extinct upon his death, he having been childless through three marriages.
