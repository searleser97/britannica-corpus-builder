Charles Fitzroy, 1st duke of Southampton, in full Charles Fitzroy, 1st duke of Southampton, duke of Cleveland, earl of Southampton, earl of Chichester, Baron Nonsuch of Nonsuch Park, Baron Newbury, original name Charles Palmer, Lord Limerick,  (baptized June 18, 1662—died September 9, 1730), the natural son of Charles II by Barbara Villiers, countess of Castlemaine. When his mother became duchess of Cleveland and countess of Southampton in 1670, he was allowed to assume the name of Fitzroy and the courtesy title of earl of Southampton. In 1675 he was created duke of Southampton and earl of Chichester in his own right and became duke of Cleveland on his mother’s death in 1709, succeeding to her titles.
His life was fairly uneventful, but he was suspected of intriguing to restore James II to the throne in 1691. From 1710 he sat in the House of Lords—but infrequently. Upon his death the titles went to his eldest son, William Fitzroy, who died without surviving issue in 1774; the titles then became extinct.
