Charles-Emmanuel de Savoie, duke de Nemours,  (born 1567—died  July 1595), eldest son of the former duke, Jacques de Savoie.
A supporter of the Holy League sponsored by the Roman Catholic Guises, he was appointed governor of Lyonnais just before he was arrested at Blois in King Henry III’s coup against the Guises (1588), when the Duc de Guise was assassinated. Escaping to Paris, Nemours quarrelled with the Duc de Mayenne, withdrew to Lyonnais, took Vienne for the League, but was taken prisoner (1593) by the archbishop of Lyon, Pierre d’Epinac. He escaped again but died while preparing a new expedition against Lyon.
