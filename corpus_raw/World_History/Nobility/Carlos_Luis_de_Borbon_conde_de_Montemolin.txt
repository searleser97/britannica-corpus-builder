Carlos Luis de Borbón, count de Montemolín, byname Don Carlos,  (born Jan. 31, 1818, Madrid, Spain—died  Jan. 13, 1861, Trieste, Austrian Empire [now in Italy]), the second Carlist, or Bourbon traditionalist, Spanish pretender (as Charles VI) who twice attempted unsuccessfully to seize the throne and who by perpetuating the breach within the Bourbon royal family helped weaken support for the monarchy.
Montemolín, grandson of Charles IV (reigned 1788–1808), was given the Carlist mantle by his father, Don Carlos, Count de Molina, in 1845. In 1846–48 Montemolín’s Carlist partisans fought a hopeless war in Catalonia against his Bourbon cousin Queen Isabella II. In 1860 he again tried to wrest the throne from Isabella but was unsuccessful. He was captured and signed an abject renunciation of his claims, which he repudiated once safely in exile. When he died childless shortly thereafter, Carlist leadership passed to his brother Don Juan.
