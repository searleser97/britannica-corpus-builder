Robert I, byname Robert the Magnificent or the Devil,  French Robert le Magnifique or le Diable,  (died between July 1 and 3, 1035, Nicaea [now İznik, Tur.]), duke of Normandy (1027–35), the younger son of Richard II of Normandy and the father, by his mistress Arlette, of William the Conqueror of England. On the death of his father (1026), Robert contested the duchy with his elder brother Richard III, legally the heir, until the latter’s opportune death a few years later. A strong ruler, Robert succeeded in exacting the obedience of his vassals even as he expanded concessions of fiefs from his ducal estates and from usurped church property to new and lower ranks of restless aristocrats. On the death of Robert II the Pious, king of France (1031), a crisis arose over the succession to the French throne. The duke gave his support to Henry I against the party favouring his younger brother; in reward for his services, he demanded and received the Vexin Français, a territory not far north of Paris, supposedly with Henry’s approval. A patron of the monastic reform movement, he died while returning from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
