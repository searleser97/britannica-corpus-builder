John George IV,   (born Oct. 18, 1668, Dresden, Saxony—died  April 27, 1694, Dresden), elector of Saxony (1691–94).
At the beginning of his reign his chief adviser was Hans Adam von Schöning (1641–96), who counselled a union between Saxony and Brandenburg and a more independent attitude toward the emperor Leopold I. In accordance with this advice certain proposals were put before Leopold to which he refused to agree; consequently the Saxon troops withdrew from the imperial army, a proceeding that led the chagrined emperor to seize and imprison Schöning in July 1692. Although John George was unable to procure his minister’s release, Leopold managed to allay the elector’s anger, and early in 1693 the Saxon soldiers rejoined the imperialists. John George IV is chiefly celebrated for his passion for Magdalene Sibylle von Neidschütz (d. 1694), created in 1693 countess of Rochlitz, whom on his accession he publicly established as his mistress. John George left no legitimate issue, and the electorship passed to his brother Frederick Augustus (Augustus II of Poland).
