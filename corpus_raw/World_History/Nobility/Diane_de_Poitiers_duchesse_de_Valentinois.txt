Diane De Poitiers,  (born Sept. 3, 1499—died  April 22, 1566, Anet, France), mistress of Henry II of France. Throughout his reign she held court as queen of France in all but name, while the real queen, Catherine de Médicis, was forced to live in comparative obscurity. Diane seems to have concerned herself with augmenting her income and with making provisions for her family and protégés rather than with public affairs. A beautiful woman with a lively, cultivated mind, she was a friend and patron of poets, including Pierre de Ronsard, and of many artists. The great Renaissance architect Philibert Delorme built her château at Anet, and the Mannerist sculptor Jean Goujon adorned it with his works.
Diane came to court as a lady-in-waiting first to the mother of Francis I, Louise of Savoy, then to Queen Claude. Shortly after the death of her husband, Louis de Brézé, comte de Maulevrier, in 1531, the prince Henry, then duc d’Orléans and 20 years her junior, fell violently in love with her, and she became his mistress. Even in their own time legends grew up around them. On Henry’s death (1559), his wife, Catherine, forced Diane to restore those of the crown jewels Henry had given her and to accept the fortress-like château of Chaumont in exchange for Chenonceaux. Diane retired to Anet. The Lettres inédites de Diane de Poitiers were published by G. Guiffrey (1866).
