Lady Penelope Rich, née Penelope Devereux,  (born 1562?—died  1607), English noblewoman who was the “Stella” of Sir Philip Sidney’s love poems Astrophel and Stella (1591).
She was the daughter of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex. From an early age she was expected to be a likely wife for Sidney, but after her father’s death her guardian, Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, arranged her marriage in 1581 to Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich (afterward Earl of Warwick). The marriage was unhappy from the start, and Sidney continued to have an emotional attachment to her until his death in 1586. Sidney celebrated her charms and his affection for her in the series of sonnets collected in Astrophel and Stella.
Though married and the mother of seven children, she became the mistress of Charles Blount, 8th Lord Mountjoy, in about 1590; they had five children. Her husband abandoned her in 1601 after her brother, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, was executed for plotting a revolt against Queen Elizabeth, and she thenceforth lived openly with Mountjoy (afterward Earl of Devonshire), marrying him in 1605 after having obtained a divorce from her first husband.
