Alexander I,   (born April 5, 1857, Verona, Venice [Italy]—died  Nov. 17, 1893, Graz, Austria), the first prince of modern autonomous Bulgaria.
The son of Prince Alexander of Hesse (previously created prince of Battenberg upon his morganatic marriage) and a favourite nephew of Alexander II of Russia, Alexander served during 1877 with the Russian forces in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), which resulted in the autonomy of Bulgaria. In accordance with the provisions of the Congress of Berlin (1878), Alexander was elected constitutional prince of the newly autonomous Bulgarian state on April 29, 1879, but he had to deal with a strong Russian interference in domestic affairs. Saddled with what he regarded as an absurd liberal constitution, however, he set himself to undermining the state’s constitutional bases, first dissolving the national assembly (1880) and then suspending the constitution and assuming for himself plenary powers (1881). With the deterioration of his relations with Russia after the accession of Alexander III, however, he restored the constitution (1883) and accepted a new liberal–conservative coalition government to combat Russian influence.
When the annexation of Eastern Rumelia by Bulgaria (September 1885) further exacerbated Russo-Bulgarian relations, the Tsar was determined to drive Prince Alexander from his throne. In Serbia passions were also aroused, and war resulted (November 1885). Alexander successfully led Bulgarian troops against the Serbs and by late November 1885 had pushed into Serbian territory. Under Austrian pressure, however, he was forced to accept an armistice and a peace confirming the status quo (Treaty of Bucharest, March 1886), though he later won the recognition of the Great Powers for Eastern Rumelia’s union with Bulgaria (April 1886). Finally, a pro-Russian officers’ coup on Aug. 21, 1886, forced him to abdicate, and under heavy guard he was conducted out of the country. He returned shortly to reclaim his crown but, after failing to win the support of Russia, formally abdicated on Sept. 7, 1886. He later assumed the title Graf von Hartenau and served as a general in the Austrian Army.
