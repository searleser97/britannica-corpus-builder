Leopold II,   (born Oct. 3, 1797, Florence—died  Jan. 29, 1870, Rome), last reigning grand duke of Tuscany (ruled 1824–59).
Succeeding his father, Ferdinand III, on June 18, 1824, Leopold continued liberal administrative, judicial, and educational reforms and improved the transportation system. After the election (1846) of the popular and democratic Pope Pius IX, whose reforms and policies unloosed liberal enthusiasm throughout Italy, Leopold became one of the first Italian rulers to grant a constitution for representative government (Feb. 17, 1848). Popular pressure forced him to send Tuscan troops to fight against the Austrians in Lombardy. As radical agitation grew, however, he left Tuscany (Jan. 30, 1849), stating that he could not agree to the planned constituent assembly, and on February 21 joined the pope at the fortified port of Gaeta south of Rome; Pius IX had fled the radical extremists in Rome.
After the Austrian victory over the Piedmontese at Novara (March 23), the Tuscan Assembly installed a dictator whose brief rule proved unsuccessful; the Assembly then invited Leopold to return (April 12). He accepted but secretly arranged for Austrian troops to march in first (May 25, 1849). Leopold himself did not return until July 28; the Austrians remained until 1855. Leopold prorogued the parliament in September 1850, finally revoked the constitution on May 5, 1852, and imprisoned the Tuscan revolutionaries.
Despite the end of Austrian occupation in 1855, Leopold’s prestige remained low. He refused the popular demand to join the French and Sardinians in their war against Austria in 1859, and, in the face of mounting opposition, he quietly left Tuscany (April 27) to abdicate in favour of his son Ferdinand IV (July), who never reigned.
