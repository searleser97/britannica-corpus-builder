Louis-Joseph, 8e prince de Condé,  (born Aug. 9, 1736, Paris—died  May 13, 1818, Paris), one of the princely émigrés during the French Revolution.
He was the only son of the Duc de Bourbon and Charlotte of Hesse and assumed the Condé title on his father’s death (1740). In 1753 he married Godefride de Rohan-Soubise (d. 1760). Brought up for the army, he did good service in the Seven Years’ War. On the fall of the Bastille (1789), he was one of the first princes to emigrate. Establishing himself at Worms in 1791, he set about raising the émigré “army of Condé,” which took part, not very effectively, in the antirevolutionary campaigns of 1792–96. After the Franco-Austrian peace of 1797, Condé went to Russia, served with the Russians in 1799, then passed to Austria in 1800 and to England in 1801. Returning to France in 1814, he died in Paris four years later.
