Armand I de Bourbon, prince de Conti,  (born Oct. 11, 1629, Paris—died  Feb. 21, 1666, Pézénas, Fr.), second son of Henry II de Bourbon, 3rd prince of Condé, and younger brother of Louis II, the Great Condé, and of the duchess of Longueville. The title of prince of Conti was revived in his favour in 1629.
Destined for the church, Armand de Bourbon was the French crown’s immediate nominee for a cardinal’s hat; this gave rise to intrigues aimed at securing the nomination for another candidate if he should renounce it. On the outbreak of the Fronde in 1649, when his brother was supporting the government, his sister took Conti to join the Parisians, whereupon he was made generalissimo of the Fronde—to be the puppet of his supporters. Arrested with Condé and his sister’s husband in 1650, he was released with them in 1651 as a result of the coalition between their faction and the Frondeurs, one of the terms of which was that he should marry Charlotte de Lorraine, daughter of the duchesse de Chevreuse. He accordingly renounced his ecclesiastical prospects, but the bargain was set aside by Condé. In 1652 he was left by Condé in command in Bordeaux, whence government forces expelled him in July 1653. He then made his peace with Cardinal Mazarin, marrying his niece Anne-Marie Martinozzi (1637–72) in 1654 and being sent to command in Catalonia (1654) and in Italy (1657). After figuring as a patron of literature, he fell like his sister under the influence of Jansenism. He died in Languedoc, of which he was governor.
