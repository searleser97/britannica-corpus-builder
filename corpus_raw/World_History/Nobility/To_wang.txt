To-wang, orTogtokhtör,  (flourished 19th century), Mongolian prince who opposed Manchu rule and supported Mongolia’s independence from China. Concerned with education, he set up a primary school open to commoners, had Buddhist scriptures translated into Mongol, and codified practical advice for herdspeople in a book he circulated among them. To diversify the economy, he encouraged agriculture and the production of textiles and woolen goods. His plan to build a central temple to replace 11 local temples turned his people against him; higher authorities decided in his favour, but the temple project was canceled.
