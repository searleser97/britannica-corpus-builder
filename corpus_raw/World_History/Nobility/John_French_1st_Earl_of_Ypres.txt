John French, 1st earl of Ypres, in full John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st earl of Ypres, Viscount French of Ypres and of High Lake,  (born September 28, 1852, Ripple, Kent, England—died May 22, 1925, Deal, Kent), field marshal who commanded the British army on the Western Front between August 1914, when World War I began, and December 17, 1915, when he resigned under pressure and was succeeded by Gen. (afterward Field Marshal) Douglas Haig.
The battles fought under his direction at Ypres, Belgium, and elsewhere were noteworthy in Britain for high numbers of British losses—e.g., more than 117,000 casualties in the first two battles of Ypres. He was considered unable to adapt himself to unfamiliar conditions of war or to work harmoniously with the British government, his own subordinates, or the French and Belgian generals with whom he was supposed to cooperate.
A soldier from 1874, French became a public figure with his successful leadership of British cavalry against the Boers in the South African War (1899–1902). He was appointed inspector general in 1907 and chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1913.
On August 23, 1914, near Mons, Belgium, French directed the first major engagement of British troops in the war. Although superior German strength forced him to retreat, he had intended merely to cover the withdrawal of the French Fifth Army, and, as a delaying action, the battle was a success. He was criticized, however, for his failure to coordinate the movement of his two corps or even to remain in touch with their commanders. After a costly battle at Le Cateau, France, on August 26, he seemed to lose his nerve and planned to withdraw south of the Seine River and perhaps from France altogether. Lord Kitchener, the British secretary of state for war, induced him to remain in action and to work more closely with the French and Belgian armies.
On October 19, 1914, French ordered his force, increased by that time to three corps, to start a two-branched offensive eastward from Ypres. The British collided with German armies that began an offensive of their own the next day. The bitter resistance of French’s army helped prevent the German forces from advancing, but no movement was made by the Allies either. By November 22 the battle had ended in a stalemate. In 1915 the battles of Neuve-Chapelle (from March 10), Ypres again (from April 22), and Loos (from September 25) also produced no Allied advance. French’s indecisive use of his reserves at Loos led to his removal.
French was created a viscount in 1916 and an earl in 1922. He was commander in chief in the United Kingdom and then (1918–21) lord lieutenant of Ireland. In 1919 he published 1914, his own account of the war.
