Richard Fitzalan, 4th earl of Arundel,  (born 1346—died Sept. 21, 1397, London, Eng.), one of the chief opponents of Richard II.
He began as a member of the royal council during the minority of Richard II and about 1381 was made one of the young king’s governors. About 1385 he joined the baronial party led by the King’s uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester, and in 1386 was a member of the commission appointed to regulate the kingdom and the royal household. As admiral of the west and south he gained a victory over the French and their allies off Margate in 1387.
Then came the King’s futile attempt to arrest Arundel, which was the signal for the outbreak of hostilities. The Gloucester faction quickly gained the upper hand, and Arundel was again a member of the royal council. After a personal altercation with the King at Westminster in 1394, Arundel underwent a short imprisonment. In 1397 he was involved in a conspiracy against Richard II and was beheaded on Tower Hill.
