Bolesław III, byname Bolesław the Wry-Mouthed, Polish Bolesław Krzywousty,  (born Aug. 20, 1085—died  Oct. 28, 1138), prince of Poland who introduced into his country the senioriate system, by which the eldest son received the major part of the royal inheritance. He converted the people of Pomerania to Christianity.
Son of Władysław I Herman, ruler of Poland, and Judith of Bohemia, Bolesław III and his illegitimate elder half brother, Zbigniew, each ruled a Polish province during their father’s lifetime. Bolesław III succeeded to his father’s princely title (no Polish ruler assumed the title of king from 1082 to 1296) in 1102 and spent the next several years fighting Zbigniew for control of the country. Not long after repelling an invasion of Silesia (1109) by the German king Henry V, Bolesław, who had exiled Zbigniew in 1107, allowed his half brother to return; soon, however, he accused Zbigniew of treason and had him blinded. Zbigniew died shortly thereafter.
For the next 22 years (1113–35) Bolesław sought control of Poland’s former province of Pomerania; he conquered Eastern Pomerania in 1122 but did not secure Western Pomerania until he had sworn fealty to the Holy Roman emperor Lothar II in 1135. Bolesław sent missionaries into Pomerania, converted the pagan tribes there to Christianity, and integrated the people into the Polish state. He then enacted legislation to secure Pomerania and Silesia for his eldest son and lesser provinces for his younger sons. The senioriate system, a halfway measure between primogeniture and equal distribution among all male heirs, was devised to satisfy all princely heirs; yet it caused dissension and eventually led to the disintegration of the state.
