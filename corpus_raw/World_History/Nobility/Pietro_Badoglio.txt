Pietro Badoglio,  (born Sept. 28, 1871, Grazzano Monferrato, Italy—died Nov. 1, 1956, Grazzano Badoglio [formerly Grazzano Monferrato]), general and statesman during the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini (1922–43). In September 1943 he extricated Italy from World War II by arranging an armistice with the Allies.
Badoglio entered the Italian army in 1890 as an artillery officer and fought in the Ethiopian campaign of 1896 and in the Italo-Turkish War (1911–12). In World War I he distinguished himself by planning and directing the capture of Monte Sabotino on Aug. 6, 1916. Although his forces suffered defeat in the Battle of Caporetto on Oct. 24, 1917, he emerged from the war a high-ranking general and conducted the armistice talks for the Italians. He was chief of the Italian general staff from 1919 to 1921. Initially lukewarm to Mussolini, Badoglio remained outside of politics for one year after the March on Rome (1922). He then served briefly as ambassador to Brazil before Mussolini named him chief of staff once again on May 4, 1925. He was made a field marshal on May 26, 1926.
He governed Libya from 1928 to 1934 with the title of marquis of Sabotino. He assumed command of the Italian forces in Ethiopia in 1935 and captured Addis Ababa, the capital, where he remained for a short time in 1936 as viceroy of Ethiopia. He later received the title of duke of Addis Ababa.
In 1940 he differed with Mussolini over Italy’s preparations for entering World War II. On Dec. 4, 1940, in the midst of Italy’s disastrous campaign in Greece, he resigned as chief of staff and disavowed responsibility for Mussolini’s acts. It is not clear, however, whether his objections were tied to concerns over morals or military strategy. In any case, upon the downfall of Mussolini (July 25, 1943), which he had been instrumental in organizing, Badoglio became prime minister; he arranged for an armistice with the Allies on September 3. On September 8 Italy’s unconditional surrender to the Allies was announced. Badoglio dissolved the Fascist Party, and on October 13 Italy declared war on Nazi Germany. In June 1944 he resigned to allow the formation of a new cabinet in liberated Rome and retired to his familial home in Grazzano Badoglio.
