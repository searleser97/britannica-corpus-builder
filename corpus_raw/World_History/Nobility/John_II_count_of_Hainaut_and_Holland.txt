John II, also called John of Avesnes, Dutch Jan Van Avesnes,  (born c. 1247—died September 11?, 1304, Hainaut), count of Hainaut (1280–1304) and of the Dutch provinces of Holland and Zeeland (1299–1304), who united the counties and prevented the northward expansion of the house of Dampierre, the counts of Flanders.
Eldest son of John of Avesnes, count of Hainaut, and Alida, sister of Count William II of Holland, John secured the title count of Hainaut in 1280 as John I. Long a friend of King Philip IV the Fair of France, the count influenced his cousin, Count Floris V of Holland, to end his long, friendly relations with King Edward I of England and make an alliance with France, an action that was violently opposed by several Dutch nobles, who seized and murdered Floris (June 27, 1296).
John was then named governor of Holland and guardian of Floris’s 15-year-old son, after whose death (1299), he became count of Holland as John II. Though the people of Holland accepted his leadership, he had to ward off a challenge by King Albert I of Germany (1300), repel an invasion by English forces (1300?), subdue a rebellion in Zeeland (1301), and fight the army of the Dampierres for two years before driving the Flemish from Holland and Zeeland in 1304.
