Edward Stanley, 3rd earl of Derby,  (born 1508/09—died  Oct. 24, 1572, Lathom House, near Ormskirk, Lancashire, Eng.), second son of the 2nd earl, succeeding to the earldom on his father’s death in May 1521. During his minority Cardinal Wolsey was his guardian, and as soon as he came of age he began to take part in public life. He helped to quell the rising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536, but, remaining true to the Roman Catholic faith, he disliked and opposed the religious changes made under Edward VI. Under Elizabeth his younger sons, Sir Thomas (d. 1576) and Sir Edward Stanley (d. 1609), were concerned in a plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots, and he himself was suspected of disloyalty.
