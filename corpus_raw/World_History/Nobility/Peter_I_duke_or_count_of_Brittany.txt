Peter I, also called Peter Of Dreux, byname Peter Mauclerc, French Pierre De Dreux, or Pierre Mauclerc,  (born 1190—died  1250, at sea en route to France), duke or count of Brittany from 1213 to 1237, French prince of the Capetian dynasty, founder of a line of French dukes of Brittany who ruled until the mid-14th century.
Married by his cousin King Philip II Augustus of France to Alix, heiress to Brittany, Peter did homage for the province in 1213 and assumed the title of duke, though he was considered merely a count by the French. He energetically asserted his authority over the Breton lands, annexing new fiefs to the ducal domain, granting privileges to the towns, and regularizing the administration.
As guardian for his son, John I the Red, after Alix’s death in 1221, Peter attempted to build up his own power against the day of his son’s majority; he extorted concessions from the French regency in 1227 by means of rebellion. He transferred his allegiance from the French to the English king from 1229 until 1234, even though his predecessor, Arthur I, had been murdered by the English. But when John came of age (1237), Peter had to renounce Brittany and henceforth was merely count of Braine.
Called Mauclerc (“Bad Clerk”) either because his early training for the church was abortive or because he quarreled continually with the episcopate, Peter spent much of his life under excommunication and was persuaded to go on a crusade (1239–40) in penance. In 1248 he went to Egypt on another crusade. Wounded in battle, he died on his way home.
