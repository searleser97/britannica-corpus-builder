Ernest I,   (born Jan. 2, 1784, Coburg, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld [Germany]—died  Jan. 29, 1844, Gotha, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha), duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (as Ernest III) from 1806 and then, from 1826, duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. He was the uncle of Queen Victoria and the father of her husband, Prince Albert.
When Ernest succeeded to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld on the death of his father (Francis) in 1806, the duchy was occupied by Napoleon, and Ernest did not recover it until the peace of Tilsit (July 1807). He commanded the Saxon V army corps in 1813–14 and reduced Mainz by blockade; he also took part in the campaign of 1815. At the Congress of Vienna he received the principality of Lichtenberg, which he sold to Prussia in 1834.
In 1826, after the death of his brother-in-law Frederick, the last duke of Saxe-Gotha (1825), Ernest gave up Saalfeld and received Gotha, becoming Ernest I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. In 1821 he had given a constitution to Coburg, but he did not change the traditional system of estates in Gotha. He married twice: (1) in 1817, Louise of Saxe-Gotha, whom he divorced in 1826; (2) in 1832, Mary of Württemberg. Of his sons, Ernest (b. 1818) succeeded him, and Albert (b. 1819) married Queen Victoria of Great Britain. His brother Leopold (1790–1865) became king of the Belgians and his sister Victoria (1786–1861) was Queen Victoria’s mother.
