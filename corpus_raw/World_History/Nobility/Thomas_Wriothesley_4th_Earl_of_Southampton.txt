Thomas Wriothesley, 4th earl of Southampton,  (born 1607—died  May 16, 1667, London, Eng.), major supporter of both Charles I and Charles II of England.
The only surviving son of the 3rd Earl, Thomas attended St. John’s College, Cambridge. When the dispute began between Charles I and Parliament, he took the side of the latter, but soon the violence of its leaders drove him to support Charles, one of whose most loyal advisers he remained thereafter. He was, however, eager for peace and negotiated with the representatives of Parliament in 1643 and again at Uxbridge in 1645. Having paid more than £6,000 to the state, Southampton was allowed to live unmolested in England during the Commonwealth period, and on the restoration of Charles II he was made lord high treasurer. As treasurer he was remarkable for his freedom from any taint of corruption and for his efforts in the interests of economy and financial order. He died without surviving sons, and his titles became extinct. The name of the 4th Earl is perpetuated in London in Southampton Row and Southampton Street, Holborn, where his London residence stood.
