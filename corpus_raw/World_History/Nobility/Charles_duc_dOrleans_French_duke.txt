Charles, duc d’Orléans, also called duc d’Angoulême,  (born January 22, 1522—died September 9, 1545, Forêtmoutiers, France), King Francis I’s favourite son and a noted campaigner, who twice took Luxembourg from the Holy Roman emperor Charles V’s forces (1542 and 1543). There were plans for marrying him to a Habsburg princess who would bring him either Milan or part of the Netherlands as a dowry, but he died suddenly, after exposing himself to infection from the plague.
