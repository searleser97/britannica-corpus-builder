Danilo I, in full Danilo Nikola Petrović,  (born c. 1670, Njeguši, Montenegro—died January 11, 1735), the first ruler of Montenegro of the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty, which lasted from 1697 to 1918, when Montenegro was absorbed into the new Yugoslav state.
In 1696 Danilo was nominated vladika, or prince-bishop, with power to select his successor from among his relatives—thus confirming the hereditary principle in the nation’s theocratic system. The succession was henceforth regularly from uncle to nephew, owing to the rule of celibacy imposed on the ruling monastic order.
The reign of Danilo I was characterized by the massacre of the Muslims settled in the principality (the “Montenegrin Vespers”) on Christmas Eve, 1702; the great defeat of the Turkish invaders at Tzarevlatz (1712); the capture of Cetinje by the Turks and the destruction for the third time of its monastery (1714); and the inauguration of intimate relations with Russia when Danilo visited Peter the Great in 1715. With Russian aid, Danilo was enabled in some degree to repair the ruin that had overtaken his little realm. He was succeeded by his nephew Sava Petrović (reigned 1735–67).
