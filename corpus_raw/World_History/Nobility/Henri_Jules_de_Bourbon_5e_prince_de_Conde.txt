Henri-Jules de Bourbon, 5e prince de Condé, also called (1646–86) Duc (duke) d’Enghien,  (born July 29, 1643, Paris—died April 1, 1709, Paris), the eldest son of the Great Condé (the 4th prince), whom he accompanied on military campaigns.
Known from 1646 as the Duc d’Enghien, he was taken to and fro by his mother during the Fronde and eventually into exile with his father, returning to France in 1659. He was married in 1663 to Anne of Bavaria, daughter of Edward, Prince Palatine. At this time he was proposed as a candidate for the Polish throne. His father tried to embark him on a military career, but Henri-Jules showed no aptitude, though he served in campaign after campaign between 1666 and 1693.
On his father’s death (1686), he devoted himself chiefly to expanding and improving Chantilly, the principal country seat of the Condés. A little man, interested in the arts, the sciences, and technology, an able courtier and a magnificent host, he was eccentric, given to malicious practical jokes, and a terror to his wife and children. In his last years he was mentally quite deranged. Of his nine children by his wife, one son and three daughters survived him, the most notable being Anne-Louise Bénédicte (1676–1753), duchesse du Maine.
