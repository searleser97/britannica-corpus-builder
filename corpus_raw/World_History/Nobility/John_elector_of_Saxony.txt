John, byname John The Steadfast,  German Johann Der Beständige,  (born June 30, 1468, Meissen, near Dresden, Saxony—died  Aug. 16, 1532, Schweinitz, near Wittenberg, Wittenberg), elector of Saxony and a fervent supporter of Martin Luther; he took a leading part in forming alliances among Germany’s Protestant princes against the Habsburg emperors’ attempts at forced reconversion.
After his father’s death in 1486, John ruled the lands of the Ernestine branch of the Wettin dynasty of Saxony jointly with his older brother Frederick III the Wise, succeeding his brother as elector in 1525. A firm Lutheran, John immediately created the League of Gotha with Philip the Magnanimous, landgrave of Hesse, and shortly thereafter, the Torgau League with Germany’s northern princes. For the first time, German Lutheran rulers were united in a firm alliance. He was leader of the church reformers at the Diet of Speyer (1526) and obtained concessions on the religious question from the emperor Charles V. When these concessions were rescinded at the next diet in 1529, John became one of the original Protestants by signing the minority protest. He accepted the Lutheran Augsburg Confession (1530) and in the winter of 1530–31 was one of the key figures in the formation of the Schmalkaldic League to protect Protestant interests. Charles V, who needed the reformers’ aid against the Turks, consequently agreed to the religious Peace of Nürnberg (1532). At the time of John’s death, electoral Saxony, staunchly Lutheran, had become the leading Protestant state in Germany.
