Ranulf de Gernons, 4th earl of Chester,  Ranulf also spelled Randulf, or Ralph,  (born c. 1100—died  Dec. 16, 1153), a key participant in the English civil war (from 1139) between King Stephen and the Holy Roman empress Matilda (also a claimant to the throne of England). Initially taking Matilda’s part, he fought for her in the Battle of Lincoln (1141), capturing and briefly imprisoning Stephen. Later (1149) he transferred his allegiance to the king in return for a grant of the city and castle of Lincoln. Coventry received its original charter from him.
