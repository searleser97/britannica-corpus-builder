Geoffrey IV, also called Geoffrey Plantagenet, byname Geoffrey The Fair, French Geoffroi Plantagenet, or Geoffroi Le Bel,  (born Aug. 24, 1113—died  Sept. 7, 1151, Le Mans, Maine [France]), count of Anjou (1131–51), Maine, and Touraine and ancestor of the Plantagenet kings of England through his marriage, in June 1128, to Matilda (q.v.), daughter of Henry I of England. On Henry’s death (1135), Geoffrey claimed the duchy of Normandy; he finally conquered it in 1144 and ruled there as duke until he gave it to his son Henry (later King Henry II of England) in 1150.
Geoffrey was popular with the Normans, but he had to suppress a rebellion of malcontent Angevin nobles. After a short war with Louis VII of France, Geoffrey signed a treaty (August 1151) by which he surrendered the whole of Norman Vexin (the border area between Normandy and Île-de-France) to Louis.
