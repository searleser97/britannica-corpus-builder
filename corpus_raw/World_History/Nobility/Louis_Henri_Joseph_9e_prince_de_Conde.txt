Louis-Henri-Joseph, 9e prince de Condé,  (born April 13, 1756, Paris—died  Aug. 27, 1830, Saint-Leu, Fr.), last of the princes of Condé, whose unfortunate son and sole heir, the Duc d’Enghien, was tried and shot for treason on Napoleon’s orders in 1804, ending the princely line.
The 9th Prince of Condé was married in 1770 to Louise-Marie-Thérèse d’Orléans (1750–1822), who bore him a son, Louis-Antoine, duc d’Enghien, in 1772, but from whom he parted in 1780. Emigrating with his father and son in 1789 at the outbreak of the Revolution, he went in 1795 to England to prepare the abortive expedition of the Comte d’Artois (the future Charles X) to the Vendée. Returning to France in 1814, he tried to organize resistance in Anjou during the Hundred Days, then escaped to Spain until the Second Restoration.
On his father’s death in 1818 he inherited but did not assume the Condé title. As he had no heirs, he left the residue of the Condé inheritance (after splendid bequests to his mistress) to Henri d’Orléans, duc d’Aumale. Within a few months he was found hanging from a window fastening in his bedroom at Saint-Leu, the magnificent estate that he had bought six years earlier.
