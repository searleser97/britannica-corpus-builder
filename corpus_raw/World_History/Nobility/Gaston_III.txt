Gaston III, byname Gaston Phoebus, orPhēbus,  (born 1331—died  August 1391), count of Foix from 1343, who made Foix one of the most influential and powerful domains in France. A handsome man (hence the surname Phoebus), his court in southern France was famous for its luxury. His passion for hunting led him to write the treatise Livre de la chasse (“Book of the Hunt”). It was translated into English by Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York, as the bulk of the first English book on hunting, The Master of Game.
In 1345, early in the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453), Gaston fought against the English and in 1347 was named special lieutenant general in southern France. Suspected of conspiring with his brother-in-law Charles II the Bad, king of Navarre, against France, he was imprisoned in 1356. When he was released, he went to fight the pagans in Prussia.
In 1358, after his return to France, he saved some members of the royal family as they were besieged in the marketplace of Meaux during the peasant revolt called the Jacquerie. He was forced to depart immediately to combat the Count d’Armagnac in an old family rivalry over the countship of Bigorre. Having defeated him in 1372, Gaston arranged a truce that was sealed by the marriage of his son to one of the daughters of the Count d’Armagnac.
In 1380 Gaston Phoebus was named lieutenant general of Languedoc by Charles V of France but upon the latter’s death that same year he lost the position to the Duke de Berry. Enraged, Gaston defeated the duke in combat and then retired to his mountain estates.
Suspecting his only son (also named Gaston) of plotting to poison him, Gaston had the youth put in prison, where he died.
