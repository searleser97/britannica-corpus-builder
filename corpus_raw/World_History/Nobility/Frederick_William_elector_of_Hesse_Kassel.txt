Frederick William,   (born Aug. 20, 1802—died  Jan. 6, 1875, Prague), elector of Hesse-Kassel from 1847 after 16 years’ co-regency with his father; he was noted for his reactionary stand against liberalizing trends manifested during the revolutionary events of 1848. In 1850 he re-instated an unpopular adviser, Hans Daniel Hassenpflug, who called on the German Confederation to restore by force the authority of the elector. At the end of the Seven Weeks’ War (1866), in which he sided with Austria, he was deposed, and his lands were seized by the victorious Prussians.
