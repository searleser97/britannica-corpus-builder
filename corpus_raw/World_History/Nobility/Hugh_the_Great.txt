Hugh the Great, also called Hugh the White, French Hugues le Grand or Hugues le Blanc,  (died June 16/17, 956), duke of the Franks, count of Paris, and progenitor of the Capetian kings of France. He was the most powerful man in the kingdom of France (West Francia) during the reign of Louis IV d’Outremer and the early years of King Lothar.
Son of a king (Robert I), father of another (Hugh Capet), and brother-in-law of three more (Rudolf of France, Athelstan of England, and Otto of Germany), Hugh possessed such vast territories that he could easily have assumed the crown on the death of Rudolf in 936, though perhaps at the cost of giving up his numerous counties and abbeys. Preferring to work from behind the throne, he instead suggested the accession of Louis IV, son of the deposed Charles III the Simple, who named him, in return, “duke of the Franks.” Louis proved no puppet, however, and his reign saw an almost constant struggle between king and duke in which all the great magnates of France, Otto I of Germany, and the dukes of Lorraine were at one time or another involved. In 945 Louis fell into Hugh’s hands and was incarcerated for a year before pressure from abroad and public opinion at home brought his release. Excommunicated by French and German councils and by the pope, Hugh finally submitted to Louis in 951.
On the death of the king three years later, Hugh again turned down the opportunity to become king, plumping instead for Louis’s young son, Lothar; but for his last two years Hugh was effectively the ruler of France.
