Abraham de Fabert,  (born Oct. 11, 1599, Metz, France—died  May 17, 1662, Sedan), marshal of France, a leading French commander during the reigns of Louis XIII and Louis XIV.
Fabert’s grandfather had been ennobled by Charles III, and his father had served Henry IV. At the age of 14 he entered the French Guard and from 1618 was almost constantly in service. His genius at engineering enabled him to play a key role in the sieges by which Louis XIII’s troops forced the surrender of the Huguenot strongholds of southern France during the 1620s. He further distinguished himself in the Battle of Veillane in the Alps in 1630.
Appointed governor of Sedan when that town came under French rule in 1642, he remained loyal to the government of Jules Mazarin, first minister to young King Louis XIV, during the aristocratic uprising known as the Fronde (1648–53). Fabert was made a marquis in 1650 and a lieutenant general in 1651. The small force that he organized in Sedan in 1651–52 became the core of the army that defeated the rebel princes and restored Mazarin to power. In 1654 Fabert besieged and captured the rebel base at Stenay, surrendered by its governor, the prince de Condé. He was created marshal of France in June 1658.
