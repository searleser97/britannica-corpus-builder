Ranulf de Blundeville, 6th earl of Chester, also called Duke Of Brittany, Ranulf  also spelled Randulf, or Ralph,  (born c. 1172, Oswestry, Powys, Wales—died  Oct. 28, 1232, Wallingford, Oxfordshire, Eng.), most celebrated of the early earls of Chester, with whom the family fortunes reached their peak.
Ranulf succeeded his father Hugh de Kevelioc (1147–81), son of Ranulf, the 4th earl, in 1181 and was created Earl of Lincoln in 1217. He married Constance, widow of King Henry II’s son, Geoffrey of Brittany, and was thus wont to style himself the Duke of Brittany and Earl of Richmond. He fought in Wales, was on the side of King John during his struggle with the barons over Magna Carta, and was one of this king’s executors; he also fought for the young King Henry III against the French invaders and their allies. In 1218–19 he went on the Fifth Crusade to the Holy Land and took part in the capture of Damietta, Egypt; then returning to England he died in 1232.
He has been described as the last relic of the great feudal aristocracy of the Norman Conquest. Although twice married, he left no children, and his immense possessions passed to his four sisters. The earl’s memory remained noted for a long time, and in the Vision of Piers Plowman his name was linked with that of Robin Hood. In November 1232 the earldom of Chester was granted to his nephew John the Scot, Earl of Huntingdon (c. 1207–1237), and in 1246, nine years after John had died childless, the title was annexed to the English crown.
