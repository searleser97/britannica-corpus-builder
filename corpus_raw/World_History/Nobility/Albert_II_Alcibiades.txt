Albert II Alcibiades,   (born March 28, 1522, Ansbach [Germany]—died  Jan. 8, 1557, Baden), margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, member of the Franconian branch of the Hohenzollern family, and a soldier of fortune in the wars between the Habsburgs and the Valois dynasty of France.
Albert served the Holy Roman emperor Charles V until January 1552, when he joined his friend Maurice, elector of Saxony, in a league with Charles’s enemy, Henry II of France. The allied forces drove Charles out of Innsbruck, and the Emperor’s brother Ferdinand negotiated the Treaty of Passau (August 1552) with Maurice, thereby achieving a truce in the religious disputes within Germany. Albert, however, rejected the treaty and again offered his services to Charles, who was attempting to retake Metz from the French. In return, Charles ratified Albert’s seizure of large German territories. By early 1553, however, Charles had handed over control of German affairs to Ferdinand. Maurice, who had allied himself with Ferdinand, then led a coalition against Albert, who was defeated at Sievershausen (July 9, 1553). Not long after, (December 1), the Imperial Chamber at Speyer outlawed Albert, and he sought asylum in France (June 1554). In 1556 Albert returned to Germany with plans of revenge but died before he could carry them out.
