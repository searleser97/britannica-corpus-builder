John Neville, earl of Northumberland, also called (1470–71) 1st Marquess Of Montagu,  (born between 1428 and 1435—died  April 14, 1471, Barnet, Hertfordshire, Eng.), leading partisan in the English Wars of the Roses. He was the son of Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, and the brother of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, the “Kingmaker.”
John Neville was a ringleader in the conflict between the Nevilles and Percys in 1453, which was the real beginning of the civil war called the Wars of the Roses. This rivalry, involving an ambition to control the Scottish march, dominated Neville’s career. Despite close personal ties with Henry VI, Neville supported Edward IV and, as warden of the east march, beat down the last traces of Lancastrian resistance in 1464, notably at Hedgeley Moor (April) and Hexham (May). For this he was created, in May 1464, Earl of Northumberland, a title heretofore held by the Percy family.
A hesitant man, he held aloof from Warwick’s intrigues against Edward IV in the summer of 1470. But the king, suspicious of Neville, restored the earldom of Northumberland to Henry Percy (March 1470), creating Neville Marquess of Montagu, a title without lands. Neville joined the rebels, which was the immediate cause of Edward’s flight abroad (October 1470), but did not attack him on his landing in Yorkshire in March 1471. However, he finally joined his brother at Coventry and was killed with him in battle at Barnet.
