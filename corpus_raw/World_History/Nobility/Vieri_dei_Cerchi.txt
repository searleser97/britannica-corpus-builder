Vieri dei Cerchi,  (flourished 1300, Florence [Italy]), Florentine noble and banker who became the leader of the faction known as the Whites in the civil strife of the late 13th century.
A knight who fought in the Guelf (pro-papal) army at Campaldino (June 11, 1289) against the city of Arezzo, Vieri dei Cerchi became in the 1290s the rival of another noble, Corso Donati, for the leadership of the Florentine “magnate” class of established wealth. Cerchi adopted a compromise position toward the democratic Ordinances of Justice passed in 1293, leaning toward their acceptance, while Donati wanted them repealed. Creating a schism in the Guelf party, they became heads of parties that took their names from factions in neighbouring Pistoia, where Florence was enforcing a five-year truce, the Cerchi becoming the Whites, the Donati the Blacks. In 1300 a clash between the Cerchi and the Donati brought about the exile of the leaders of both factions.
In May 1301 Vieri dei Cerchi led his partisans to the aid of the Whites of Pistoia, driving out the Blacks, who appealed to Donati for help. The following November a papal army led by the French prince Charles of Valois marched on Florence, occupying the city and delivering it to Corso Donati, who established a Black government.
