Renée of France,  French Renée de France, Italian in full Renata di Francia, Duchessa (duchess) di Ferrara,  (born Oct. 25, 1510, Blois, Fr.—died  June 12, 1574, Montargis), duchess of Ferrara (from 1534), an important figure in the history of the Protestant Reformation both in Italy and in France.
The second daughter of Louis XII of France and Anne of Brittany, Renée was married in 1528 to Ercole d’Este, who became duke of Ferrara in 1534. In return for renouncing her claims on Brittany, she was granted the duchy of Chartres by Francis I of France.
Renée’s court at Ferrara became a meeting place for liberal thinkers and a refuge for French Protestants. The humanist Olympia Morata was brought up there; the French poet Clément Marot found shelter there in 1535; and John Calvin himself visited Renée in 1536. Under his influence she ceased practicing Roman Catholicism in 1540. Although she received certain exemptions from Pope Paul III in 1543, her husband took her children away from her and allowed her to be sentenced to imprisonment for heresy (1554). Within a few days, however, she was released after signing a form of recantation.
A widow from 1559 and on bad terms with her son Alfonso II of Ferrara, Renée returned to France in 1560 and settled in Montargis, which she made a centre of Protestant propaganda. During the Wars of Religion (1562–98), her château was besieged by her son-in-law François, duke de Guise (1562), and she was harassed by Roman Catholic troops.
