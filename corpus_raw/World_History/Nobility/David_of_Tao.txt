David of Tao,  (died 1000), prince of the Bagratid family of Tao (Armenian: Tayk), a region between Georgia and Armenia. A just ruler and a friend of the church, he allied with Basil II to defeat the rebel Bardas Sclerus (976–979) and was rewarded with extensive lands that made him the most important ruler in Caucasia. In 987–989 he supported Bardas Phocas against Basil but was defeated and agreed to cede his lands to Basil on his death. Despite this setback, David’s heir, Bagrat III (978–1014), was able to become the first ruler of a unified Georgian kingdom.
