John Erskine, 6th earl of Mar,  (born February 1675, Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scot.—died  May 1732, Aachen [Germany]), Scottish noble who led the Jacobite rebellion of 1715, an unsuccessful attempt to gain the British crown for James Edward, the Old Pretender, son of the deposed Stuart monarch James II. Because Mar shifted his political allegiances frequently, he earned the nickname “Bobbing John.”
Mar inherited his father’s earldom in 1689 and was secretary of state for Scotland and keeper of the signet under Queen Anne (reigned 1702–14). He turned to Jacobitism after he was dismissed from office on the accession of King George I in 1714. In August 1715 he traveled secretly to Scotland and organized an uprising in the Highlands. He proclaimed James king of Great Britain at Braemar on September 6 and promised that James would restore the traditional constitution of Scotland. Although some 10,000–12,000 men rallied to the pretender’s cause, Mar, who had assumed the role of James’s commander in chief, was defeated by a smaller army under John Campbell, 2nd duke of Argyll, at Sheriffmuir, in Perth county, on November 13. Although the pretender arrived in Scotland on December 22, the rebellion soon collapsed. In February 1716 Mar fled to France and then on to Rome with James Edward, who lavished him with titles, including that of duke of Mar (unrecognized in Britain). Despite these considerable attentions, Mar intrigued against James, and by 1725 he was no longer welcome at James’s court in exile.
