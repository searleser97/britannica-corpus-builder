Henry Grey, duke of Suffolk,  (born c. 1517—died  Feb. 23, 1554, London), father of Lady Jane Grey; his opposition to Queen Mary I of England and his role in Sir Thomas Wyatt’s rebellion led to his execution.
The son of Thomas Grey, 2nd marquess of Dorset, he succeeded to the marquessate in 1530 and, in 1534, with the approval of King Henry VIII, married Frances Brandon, who would be the sole surviving heiress of the 1st duke of Suffolk in the Brandon line. Though well-educated and a committed Protestant, Dorset was a weak and ambitious man. He belonged to the party of John Dudley, duke of Northumberland, and was created duke of Suffolk on Oct. 11, 1551. He supported Northumberland’s attempt to make his daughter Lady Jane Grey queen in July 1553, but he was quick to abandon her cause when the plot failed, and he was pardoned by Queen Mary. His opposition to the queen’s plans for her Spanish marriage involved him in Wyatt’s rebellion in 1554; the dukedom again became extinct after his trial for treason and his execution on Tower Hill.
