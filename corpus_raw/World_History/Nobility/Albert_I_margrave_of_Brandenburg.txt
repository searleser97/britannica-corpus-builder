Albert I, also called Albert the Bear, German Albrecht der Bär,  (born c. 1100—died  Nov. 18, 1170), the first margrave of Brandenburg and founder of the Ascanian dynasties. He was one of the main leaders of 12th-century German expansion into eastern Europe.
In 1123 Albert inherited Saxon estates between the Harz Mountains and the middle reaches of the Elbe River from his father, Otto the Rich. After his mother’s death in 1142, he received the central German possessions of the Billung dynasty, but he was unsuccessful in his attempts to win the Saxon duchy.
His greatest achievement was in the east, where, in return for his services to the Holy Roman emperor Lothar II, in Italy (1132), he received the North Mark, east of the junction of the Elbe and Havel rivers (1134). He spent three years campaigning against the Wends and, by an arrangement made with Pribislav, prince of the Havelland, he obtained that district after the prince’s death in 1150. Taking the title margrave of Brandenburg, Albert pressed the warfare against the Wends, extended the area of his mark, and increased its population and prosperity by introducing Frisian and Saxon settlers. Albert had the help of the Premonstratensians and Cistercians in forest clearance and drainage of swamps. He coupled colonization with missionary work among the Slavs and revived the bishoprics of Havelberg and Brandenburg.
Lothar’s successor, Frederick I Barbarossa, may have made Albert archchamberlain of the empire, an office that later gave the margraves of Brandenburg the rights of an elector.
