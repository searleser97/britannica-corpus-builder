Richard Bedford Bennett, in full Richard Bedford Bennett, viscount of Mickleham and of Calgary and Hopewell,  (born July 3, 1870, Hopewell, New Brunswick, Canada—died June 27, 1947, Mickleham, Surrey, England), statesman and prime minister of Canada (1930–35) during the Great Depression.
Bennett graduated from Dalhousie University with a degree in law in 1893 and practiced in his native province of New Brunswick. In 1897 he moved westward and entered politics, serving in the legislative assemblies of the Northwest Territories and Alberta. In 1911 he entered the Canadian House of Commons, representing Calgary, Alberta, and later became director general of national service (1916) and minister of justice (1921).
Bennett became the leader of the Conservative Party in 1927 and prime minister after the 1930 election, having promised the voters to vigorously combat the effects of the Great Depression. But Bennett underestimated the severity and longevity of the Depression, and his measures to combat the country’s widespread unemployment amounted merely to slightly strengthened tariffs and some measures for unemployment relief. After the Canadian economy had languished for four years, he proposed a bold legislative program in January 1935 that in some respects resembled the New Deal put forth in the United States by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. But Bennett’s reform measures aroused distrust in his own party and failed either to revive the public’s enthusiasm or to counter its resentment over his previous laissez-faire policies, and in the October 1935 election he was overwhelmingly defeated by W.L. Mackenzie King and the Liberals. He remained as leader of the opposition until 1938, and in 1939 he retired to England, where he was made a viscount in 1941 (the peerage became extinct when he died, unmarried).
