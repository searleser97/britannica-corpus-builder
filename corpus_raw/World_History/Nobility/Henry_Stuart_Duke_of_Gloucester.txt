Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester, byname Henry of Oatlands,  (born July 8, 1639, Oatlands, Surrey, Eng.â€”died  Sept. 13, 1660, London), Protestant brother of Charles II of England.
The third son of Charles I, he visited his father the night before his execution and for three years thereafter was confined by the Commonwealth regime. In 1652 Oliver Cromwell gave him permission to go abroad, and he joined his mother and brothers in Paris. His firm adherence to the Protestant religion, however, incensed his Roman Catholic mother, Queen Henrietta Maria; and after she turned him out, he joined the Spaniards at Dunkirk, fighting alongside his brother the Duke of York (afterward James II) in 1658. Having returned to England on the restoration of Charles II, he died a few months later of smallpox, which was then ravaging London.
