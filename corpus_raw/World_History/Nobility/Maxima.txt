Máxima, née Máxima Zorreguieta Cerruti,  (born May 17, 1971, Buenos Aires, Argentina), Argentine-born Dutch queen consort of Willem-Alexander, king of the Netherlands from 2013.
Máxima was the daughter of Jorge Horacio Zorreguieta, a former minister of agriculture under the Argentine military dictatorship of Jorge Videla, and María del Carmen Cerruti de Zorreguieta. She earned a degree in economics from the Universidad Católica Argentina in 1995 and later worked for international companies in Buenos Aires, New York City, and Brussels. The announcement of her engagement to the crown prince was made on March 30, 2001. She received Dutch nationality on May 17 of that year, and the Plenary Session of the States-General granted consent for the marriage in July.
On February 2, 2002, she and Willem-Alexander were married in Amsterdam among guests that included foreign royals, other friends and family members, and some Dutch political leaders. Due to concerns in the Netherlands about his association with Videla’s military dictatorship, however, the bride’s father was absent from the festivities.
Princess Máxima made mastering the Dutch language and the history and constitutional law of the Netherlands a high priority. In October 2004 she took up a seat in the Council of State and joined her husband in performing other official duties, including acting as a representative of the royal family. The couple’s first child, Princess Catharina-Amalia, was born in December 2003; Princess Alexia and Princess Ariane were born in June 2005 and April 2007, respectively. On April 30, 2013, Willem-Alexander’s mother, Queen Beatrix, formally abdicated, and he became king of the Netherlands. Upon his accession to the throne, Máxima became queen consort, and Catharina-Amalia became princess of Orange and heir apparent.
