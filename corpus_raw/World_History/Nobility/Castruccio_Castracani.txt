Castruccio Castracani,  (born 1281, Castruccio, Tuscany [Italy]—died September 3, 1328, Lucca), condottiere, or captain of mercenaries, who ruled Lucca from 1316 to 1328.
When the Guelfs gained power in Lucca in 1300, Castruccio’s family, the wealthy Antelminelli, were exiled from Lucca. Castruccio served successively as condottiere for the French, the English, and the Lombards. When the German king Henry VII entered Italy to be crowned Holy Roman emperor, Castruccio supported him by allying himself with the powerful Uguccione della Faggiuola, lord of Pisa, and led the pro-imperial Ghibelline forces back to Lucca (1314), over which Uguccione was given power. The rivalry between the two leaders was settled when Uguccione was overthrown in 1316, and the victorious Castruccio was made lord and protector of Lucca.
In 1320 the emperor Frederick III appointed Castruccio imperial vicar of Lucca, Versilia, and Lunigiana. When the emperor Louis IV entered Italy to be crowned in Rome, Castruccio became one of his most active counselors. In 1324 Louis appointed him count of Latran, duke of Lucca, with rights of succession for his heirs, and senator—i.e., governor—of Rome. His victory over the Florentines at Altopascio in 1325 brought almost all Tuscany under his sway, and he became one of the most powerful men in Italy.
Castruccio’s long fight against the papalist Guelfs brought him, however, into conflict with the papacy, and he was twice excommunicated by John XXII (pope from 1316 to 1334). Castruccio’s sudden death, in 1328, left his empire disorganized, an easy prey for the Florentines, who soon recaptured most of his holdings.
