William IV, German in full Wilhelm Alexander,  (born April 22, 1852, Biebrich, Nassau, Germany—died February 25, 1912, Schloss Berg, near Luxembourg), grand duke of Luxembourg (1905–12), eldest son of grand duke Adolf of Nassau. Falling severely ill soon after his accession, he eventually on March 19, 1908, had his consort Maria Anna of Braganza named regent, or governor (Statthalterin). Also, having no sons and wishing to secure the succession of his daughters Marie-Adélaide and Charlotte, he had the Luxembourg Parliament allow succession in the female line.
