Bohemond VII,   (died Oct. 19, 1287), count of Tripoli from 1275 to 1287.
The son of Bohemond VI by Sibyl, sister of Leo III of Armenia, he succeeded to the county of Tripoli in 1275, with his mother as regent. He had trouble with the Templars, who were established in Tripoli; and in the very year of his death he lost Laodicea to the sultan of Egypt. He died without issue, and within two years Tripoli was captured by the Egyptians (1289).
