Robert Fitzwalter,  (died Nov. 9, 1235), English baronial leader against King John.
He first came into prominence as joint constable, with his cousin Saher de Quency (later earl of Winchester), of the castle of Vaudreuil, which, in mysterious circumstances, they surrendered to the French king Philip II in 1203. They were popularly accused of cowardice; but John issued a written statement that they had acted under his instructions. By 1212, however, Robert was in opposition to John and fled to France. Sentenced to outlawry, his lands were seized and his castles razed. As part of the king’s reconciliation settlement with the papacy, Robert’s estates were restored in the following year. But he remained active in his opposition to the King, his animosity quickened by John’s designs upon Fitzwalter’s daughter Maud (Geoffrey de Mandeville’s wife). Robert took part in the demonstrations of baronial strength and the negotiations which led to the sealing of Magna Carta in June 1215 and was one of the 25 barons named to see that the King obeyed its provisions. On the outbreak of war, Robert was placed in command of the baronial forces. Again acting with Saher de Quency, he negotiated the intervention of Philip II’s son Louis, to whom the barons offered the English throne. At the Battle of Lincoln (May 20, 1217) Robert was taken prisoner but was released in October after the conclusion of peace. In 1219, in company with Saher de Quency, he departed on crusade, returning sick, apparently early in 1221.
His memory long survived in the legend of King John and the fair Matilda (Maud), which became a popular subject of romance.
