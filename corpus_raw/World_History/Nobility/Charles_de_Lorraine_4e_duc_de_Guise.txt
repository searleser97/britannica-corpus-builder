Charles de Lorraine, 4e duke de Guise,  (born Aug. 20, 1571—died Sept. 30, 1640, Cuna, Italy), duke of Guise who lived through the rapid decline in the family’s power.
On the day of the assassination of his father, Henri, the 3rd duke (Dec. 23, 1588), Charles was arrested and transferred to the Château of Tours, in which he was imprisoned for three years, escaping in 1591. He was welcomed with enthusiasm by the Paris mob, which hoped he would wed the infanta of Spain and, with the help of Philip II, secure for himself the throne of France. But the opposition of his uncle Charles de Lorraine, duc de Mayenne, proved fatal to the scheme. At the end of the struggle, both he and Mayenne submitted to Henry IV, helped him to reduce the nobles in Languedoc, and received the government of Provence. In Cardinal de Richelieu’s days he sided with the queen mother, Marie de Médicis, and was compelled to withdraw in 1631 to Italy, where he died in 1640.
