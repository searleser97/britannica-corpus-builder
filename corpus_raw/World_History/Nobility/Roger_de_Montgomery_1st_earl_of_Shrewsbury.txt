Roger de Montgomery, 1st earl of Shrewsbury,  (born c. 1030—died  1094), Norman lord and supporter of William I the Conqueror of England.
Roger de Montgomery, son of another Roger de Montgomery, known as “the Great,” was a councillor of William, duke of Normandy, before his invasion of England and was probably entrusted by William with the government of Normandy during the expedition of 1066. Roger came to England in the following year and received extensive grants of land in different parts of the kingdom. He was created earl of Shropshire in December 1074, a position which gave him palatine control of that county and placed him among the greatest of the Marcher lords; but he and his successors were usually styled earls of Shrewsbury. A great patron of monasticism, he became a monk in his newly founded Abbey of Shrewsbury just before he died in 1094. His Norman inheritance passed to his eldest surviving son, Robert of Bellême (q.v.), and the title and the English lands went to Robert’s younger brother, Hugh. Upon the latter’s death in 1098, the title went to Robert.
