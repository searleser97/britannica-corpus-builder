Philip I, also called Philip Of Rouvres,  French Philippe De Rouvres,  (born 1345, Rouvres, Burgundy—died  November 1361, Rouvres), last Capetian duke of Burgundy (1349–61) and count of Boulogne and Artois.
Son of Philip of Burgundy, he inherited the duchy upon the death of his grandfather, Eudes IV, and inherited the countships upon the death of his grandmother, Joan of France. His mother, Joan of Boulogne, who subsequently married the king of France, John II, ruled Philip’s lands during his minority, but after her death in 1360 he was declared of age. Though he married at the age of 12, he died without heirs, and his domains were dismembered. King John granted the duchy of Burgundy to his own son, Philip II the Bold (1363).
