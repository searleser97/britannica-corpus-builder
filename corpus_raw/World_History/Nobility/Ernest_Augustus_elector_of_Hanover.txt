Ernest Augustus,   (born Nov. 20, 1629, Herzberg am Harz Castle, Hanover [Germany]—died  Jan. 23, 1698, Herrenhausen Castle), duke (from 1679) and elector (from 1692) of Hanover, father of George Louis, who became George I, king of Great Britain.
The Protestant bishop of Osnabrück from 1661, Ernest Augustus succeeded his elder brother as ruler of the duchy of Lüneburg-Calenburg (which became known as the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg or, more popularly, because of its capital city, the duchy of Hanover). In 1692, in return for lavish promises of assistance to the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburgs, the emperor Leopold I granted him the rank and title of elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg (i.e., Hanover), which became the ninth electorate of the empire. Indignant protests followed this proceeding. A league was formed to prevent any addition to the electoral college; France and Sweden were called upon for assistance. This agitation, however, soon died away, and his son was confirmed as elector by the imperial diet.
Ernest Augustus took a step of great importance in the history of Hanover and Great Britain when, in 1658, he married Sophia, daughter of the elector palatine Frederick V and granddaughter of James I of Great Britain; for their son became, by the terms of the Act of Settlement of 1701, king of Great Britain and Ireland in 1714.
