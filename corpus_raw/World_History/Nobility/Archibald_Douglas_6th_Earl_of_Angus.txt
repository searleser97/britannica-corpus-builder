Archibald Douglas, 6th earl of Angus,  (born c. 1489—died  January 1557, Tantallon Castle, East Lothian, Scot.), powerful Scottish lord during the reigns of King James V and Mary, Queen of Scots. He was the grandson of the 5th earl, Archibald Douglas (c. 1449–c. 1514).
By his second marriage in 1514 to the queen dowager Margaret Tudor, Angus aroused the jealousy of the nobles. Margaret was supplanted in 1515 as regent and guardian of the infant James V by the Duke of Albany and fled to England. On her return she found that Angus had formed a liaison with a daughter of the laird of Traquair, and she therefore allied with Albany against her husband. He was charged with high treason in 1522 and sent to France. But he returned two years later with the support of Henry VIII of England, entered Edinburgh in 1525, and called a parliament. He and the Douglases then wielded supreme power until Margaret obtained a divorce and James V escaped from his stepfather’s tutelage (1528), issuing a decree of forfeiture against him. Angus took refuge in England, and James took vengeance on his relations, burning at the stake (July 17, 1537) Angus’ sister Janet, Lady Glamis.
After the death of James V in 1542, Angus returned to Scotland, and the act of forfeiture was annulled. He was commissioned to arrange a marriage between Mary Stuart and Prince Edward (afterward Edward VI of England), but his English sympathies were disappearing. He was appointed lieutenant of southern Scotland, defeated the English at Ancrum moor on Feb. 27, 1545, and led the vanguard when the Scots were defeated at Pinkie in 1547.
His was a career in which national interests were completely subordinated to those of his family. His only surviving legitimate child, by Margaret Tudor, was Margaret, who married Matthew, 4th Earl of Lennox, and became the mother of Lord Darnley, husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. He was succeeded by his nephew David Douglas (c. 1515–57).
