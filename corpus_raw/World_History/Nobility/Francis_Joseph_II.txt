Francis Joseph II, prince of Liechtenstein, German Franz Josef, Fürst von Liechtenstein, in full Maria Aloys Alfred Karl Johannes Heinrich Michael Georg Ignatius Benediktus Gerhardus Majella von und zu Liechtenstein,  (born Aug. 16, 1906, Frauenthal Castle, near Deutschlandsberg, Austria—died Nov. 13, 1989, Grabs, Switz.), Liechtenstein prince who built the impoverished country into one of the wealthiest in Europe during his reign (1938–89).
Francis Joseph II studied forestry engineering at the Forestry and Agricultural University in Vienna. Soon after he was appointed to the throne by his great uncle Francis I (July 26, 1938), Germany annexed Austria. Francis Joseph II oversaw the formation of a national coalition government that kept Europe’s fourth-smallest nation neutral during World War II. In 1945 Liechtenstein refused Soviet demands to extradite some 500 Soviet citizens who had sought refuge there.
The production of high-technology goods in association with Switzerland built a strong industrial base. The family–owned bank in Liechtenstein—with branches in London; Zürich, Switz.; New York; and Frankfurt, Ger.—made the principality a desirable tax haven for wealthy individuals and an estimated 30,000 to 80,000 foreign companies. Among family holdings were forests in Austria, real estate in Vienna, and an estimated 1,400 paintings by such old masters as Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, and Anthony Van Dyck. In 1984 women earned voting rights in the country, and Francis Joseph II transferred much of his executive power to his son and successor, Hans Adam II.
