Frederick II, byname Frederick The Gentle, or Mild,  German Friedrich Der Sanftmütige,  (born Aug. 22, 1411, Leipzig—died  Sept. 7, 1464, Leipzig), Saxon elector (1428–64) and eldest son of Frederick the Warlike; he successfully defended his electorship against the Ascanian Saxe-Lauenburg line and instituted regular diets in his territories.
Frederick settled his disputes with the Bohemian followers of Jan Hus, church reformer and condemned heretic, in 1432, and relations were cemented in 1464, when his son Albert married the daughter of the Bohemian leader George of Poděbrady. The burgravate of Meissen, acquired in 1439, added considerable land and income. From 1446 to 1451 Frederick fought the Bruderkrieg (Brothers’ War) against his brother William over territorial claims.
