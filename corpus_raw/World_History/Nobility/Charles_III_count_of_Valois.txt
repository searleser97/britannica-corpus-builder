Charles III, also called Charles Of Valois,  (born March 12, 1270—died  Dec. 16, 1325, Le Perray, near Rambouillet, Fr.), count of Valois from 1285 and of Anjou and Maine from 1290. He was son of a king, brother of a king, uncle of three kings, and a father of a king. Though he himself never gained a crown, he sought at various times those of Aragon, France, Constantinople, and the Holy Roman Empire.
In 1285 Charles received the Valois countship from his father, Philip III of France, and in 1290 the countships of Anjou and Maine by his marriage to Margaret, daughter of Charles II of Naples; to these were added in 1291 and 1293 the countships of Alençon and Chartres, granted by his brother, Philip IV, in compensation for their father’s failure to win the crown of Aragon for Charles by a so-called crusade in 1285.
In 1301 Charles, regarding Italy as a stepping-stone toward his eastern ambitions, readily accepted Pope Boniface VIII’s invitation to aid the papal cause. After subduing Florence for the pope, Charles led an unsuccessful military campaign into Sicily before he was recalled by his brother, Philip IV, to France. In 1308 he vainly sought the title of Holy Roman emperor to ensure additional French control over Italy and the papal possessions.
As chief councillor during the reign of his nephew Louis X, Charles brought about the fall of the famous financial adviser Enguerrand de Marigny. After Louis’s death in June 1316, Charles desired the throne, but he gave way to another nephew, Philip V, who died in 1322. Charles had considerable influence with his nephew Charles IV, the new king, and was sent by him on a successful campaign into Guyenne in 1324. He had previously commanded French armies in Guyenne in 1295 and led them in Flanders in 1297, 1299, 1300, 1303, and 1314. His son, Philip VI (king from 1328 to 1350), was the first of the Valois line.
