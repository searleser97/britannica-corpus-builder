Robert II, byname Robert Curthose, French Robert Courteheuse,  (born c. 1054—died February 1134, Cardiff, Wales), duke of Normandy (1087–1106), a weak-willed and incompetent ruler whose poor record as an administrator of his domain was partly redeemed by his contribution to the First Crusade (1096–99).
The eldest son of William I the Conqueror, Robert was recognized in boyhood as his father’s successor in Normandy. Nevertheless, he twice rebelled against his father (1077/78 and c. 1082–83) and was in exile in Italy until he returned as duke on his father’s death in 1087. He was totally unable to control his rebellious vassals or to establish a central authority in Normandy.
In 1091 Robert’s younger brother, King William II of England, invaded Normandy and compelled Robert to yield two counties. William attacked again in 1094, and when a peace was made that gave him control of Normandy in return for money, Robert joined the First Crusade. He fought at Dorylaeum (1097) and was at the capture of Jerusalem (1099). His courageous leadership contributed to the victory at Ascalon (1099).
When Robert’s youngest brother, Henry I, succeeded William as king of England (1100), Robert was in Italy. He hastened back to invade England, with ignominious results, and Henry in turn invaded Normandy (1105 and 1106). Captured in the Battle of Tinchebrai (September 28, 1106), Robert spent the rest of his life as a prisoner, dying in Cardiff castle.
