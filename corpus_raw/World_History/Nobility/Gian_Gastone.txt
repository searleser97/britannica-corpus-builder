Gian Gastone, in full Gian Gastone de’ Medici,  (born 1671—died July 9, 1737), the last Medicean grand duke of Tuscany (1723–37).
His father, Cosimo III, had passed his 80th year at the time of his death, and thus Gian Gastone succeeded at a late age, 53—in bad health, worn out by dissipation, and possessing neither ambition nor aptitude for rule. The European great powers had already determined, in 1718, that the grand duchy should pass to Charles of Bourbon (the future Charles III of Spain) when the Medici line ran out, without male heirs. Charles, however, led a Spanish army in the conquest of Naples, and the resultant peace treaty of 1735 transferred the Tuscan succession to Francis II, duke of Lorraine and husband of Maria Theresa of Austria. Gian Gastone was finally obliged to submit to this. Spain withdrew its garrisons from Tuscany, and Austrian soldiers took their place and swore fealty to the grand duke on Feb. 5, 1737.
Gian Gastone died five months later, bringing the Medicean dynasty to an end.
