William Russell, 1st duke and 5th earl of Bedford,  (born 1613—died September 7, 1700), eldest son of the 4th earl, who fought first on the side of Parliament and then on the side of Charles I during the English Civil War.
In general, he played a minor part in politics. His son Lord William Russell (1639–83) was involved in the opposition to Charles II, led by Lord Shaftesbury, and was executed for treason in 1683. It was partly because of his son’s fame as patriot-martyr that the 5th earl was granted a dukedom in 1694. He was succeeded by his grandson Wriothesley Russell (1680–1711), 2nd duke, who was succeeded by his son Wriothesley Russell, (1708–32), 3rd duke.
