Philipp Christoph, count von Königsmark,   (born March 14, 1665, Stade, Bremen [Germany]—died  July 1, 1694, Hannover, Hanover), alleged German lover of Sophia Dorothea, who was consort to the Hanoverian electoral prince George (later King George I of England). Their supposed relationship led to Königsmark’s death and to Sophia Dorothea’s lifelong imprisonment.
Born of a noble German family in Swedish service, Königsmark, whose sister Maria Aurora became the mistress of the elector Frederick Augustus I of Saxony (later Augustus II the Strong, king of Poland), was a colonel in the Hanoverian service. Twice he aided the dissatisfied Sophia Dorothea in unsuccessful attempts to escape from her husband’s household in Hanover. In 1694, before he could take up a new commission in electoral Saxony, he disappeared, probably having been murdered. George divorced Sophia Dorothea and imprisoned her.
