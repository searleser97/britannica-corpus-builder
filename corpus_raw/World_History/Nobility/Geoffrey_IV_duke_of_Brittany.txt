Geoffrey IV, also called Geoffrey Plantagenet, French Geoffroi Plantagenet,  (born September 23, 1158—died August 19?, 1186, Paris [France]), duke of Brittany and earl of Richmond, the fourth, but third surviving, son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine.
In 1166, in furtherance of his father’s policy of extending and consolidating Angevin power in France, Geoffrey was betrothed to Constance, daughter and heir of Conan IV, duke of Brittany. At the same time, Duke Conan was forced to surrender to Henry II for Geoffrey’s use the whole duchy of Brittany except the county of Guingamp. Geoffrey received the homage of the Breton nobles in 1169, and in 1173 he joined the rebellion against Henry II led by his eldest brother, Henry, the “Young King,” and supported by the rulers of France, Scotland, and Flanders. He submitted to his father at Michaelmas, 1174, and was sent back to Brittany, where he proceeded to recover lost ducal estates and subdue rebellious barons. He and Constance were married in 1181.
From then until his death he fought against both his brother Richard the Lionheart and his father (toward whom he behaved atrociously), largely for possession of Anjou. In 1185 he issued an “assize” at Rennes regularizing the succession to military fiefs in Brittany. He died at Paris, either of illness or in a tournament, leaving a daughter, Eleanor, and a posthumous son, Arthur I.
