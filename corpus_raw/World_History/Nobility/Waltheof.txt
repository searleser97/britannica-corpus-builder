Waltheof,  (died May 31, 1076, Winchester), earl of Northumbria and ancestor of the Scottish kings through the marriage of his daughter Matilda to King David I.
Son of Siward, the Danish earl of Northumbria (1041–55), and Aelflaed, daughter of Aldred, earl of Northumbria, he received an earldom consisting of the shires of Huntingdon, Northampton, Bedford, Rutland, and Cambridge in 1065. He submitted to King William I the Conqueror in 1067 and, though he joined northern rebels in 1069, was restored to favour and allowed to marry William’s niece Judith. Later he was drawn into a rebellion against William (1075), for which he was condemned for treason and executed.
