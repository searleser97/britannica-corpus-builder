Thomas Percy served with distinction in France during the reign of Edward III; he also held an official position on the Scottish borders, and under Richard II he was the admiral of a fleet. He deserted Richard II in 1399 and was employed and trusted by Henry IV, but in 1403 he joined the other Percys in their revolt; he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Shrewsbury (July 21, 1403) and subsequently beheaded, the earldom becoming extinct.
