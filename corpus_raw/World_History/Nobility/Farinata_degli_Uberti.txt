Farinata degli Uberti,  (died Nov. 11, 1264), Florentine nobleman who became the leader of the Florentine Ghibellines, the proimperial party. According to Dante (Inferno, canto X), Uberti alone dissuaded the members of the Ghibelline coalition from razing the city of Florence, which they had just captured.
Uberti became chief of the Ghibellines in 1239, but he was exiled from Florence along with his party after the death of the Holy Roman emperor Frederick II in 1250. He allied himself with Frederickâ€™s natural son, Manfred, the Ghibelline claimant to the throne of Sicily (1258). In September 1260, despite lack of support from his allies in Naples and Siena and thanks to his own superior tactical skill, Uberti led the Ghibelline forces to victory over the rival propapalist Guelf party at Montaperti. He followed up this victory by capturing Florence. Uberti was condemned posthumously as a heretic by the Inquisition (1283).
