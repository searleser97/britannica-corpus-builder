Edward of Norwich, 2nd duke of York,  (born c. 1373, Norwich?, Norfolk, Eng.—died  Oct. 25, 1415, Agincourt, Fr.), Yorkist who led a checkered career in the reigns of Richard II of England and the usurper Henry IV.
Son of the 1st Duke of York, he was prominent among Richard II’s favourites and was made earl of Rutland in 1390 and earl of Cork in 1394 and given many important offices. After Richard II’s coup d’etat of 1397, he succeeded his uncle, Thomas, duke of Gloucester, as constable of England, obtaining also Gloucester’s lordship of Holderness in Yorkshire, and was created duke of Aumarle (Albemarle) in September 1397. He deserted Richard II in August 1399 but was denounced as Gloucester’s murderer in Henry IV’s first Parliament and was lucky to lose only his recent gains, including his ducal title.
He was royal lieutenant in Aquitaine in 1402 when his father’s death made him duke of York, and later he served against the rebels in South Wales. Accused by his sister, Constance, Lady Despenser, of being involved in her conspiracy against King Henry IV in 1405, York was imprisoned in the Tower of London and later in Pevensey Castle, but was soon pardoned. After joining the French expedition of Thomas, duke of Clarence, in 1412, he remained in Aquitaine until August 1413. Edward was killed at the Battle of Agincourt. He died childless, and his heir was his nephew, Richard, 3rd duke of York.
Edward was the author of The Master of Game, the oldest English book on hunting; this work was based on a translation of the Livre de la Chasse of Gaston III Phoebus, comte de Foix, with an added five chapters on the conditions and practice of hunting and of game management in England. Long copied and circulated, the work was not printed until 1904.
