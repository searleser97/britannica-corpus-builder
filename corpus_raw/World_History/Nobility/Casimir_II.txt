Casimir II, byname Casimir the Just, Polish Kazimierz Sprawiedliwy,  (born 1138—died  May 5, 1194), duke of Kraków and of Sandomierz from 1177 to 1194. A member of the Piast dynasty, he drove his brother Mieszko III from the throne and spent much of his reign fighting him. Mieszko actually regained power briefly in 1190–91, retaking Kraków. Casimir became Poland’s most powerful ruler and, at the Congress of Lenczyca (1180) was so recognized by the nobility and clergy, who, in exchange for privileges, vested hereditary rights in his descendants. He was succeeded by his son Leszek I, who spent years in battle against other claimants.
