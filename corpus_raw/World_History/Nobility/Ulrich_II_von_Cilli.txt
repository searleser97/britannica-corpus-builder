Ulrich II von Cilli,  (born c. 1406—died  Nov. 9, 1456, Belgrade, Serbia), count, later prince, and member of one of the most distinguished magnate families of Austria, who became Bohemian regent (1438–39) and virtual ruler of Hungary (1453–56).
Made a prince of the empire in 1436, Cilli nevertheless feuded with the Austrian Habsburgs until forced to recognize their suzerainty in 1443. The Habsburg German king Albert II installed him as Bohemian regent in 1438 but soon dismissed him. After securing the coronation of Albert’s posthumous son as Hungarian king Ladislas V, Cilli gained control over the boy and ruled Hungary after the defeat of János Hunyadi, the governor of Hungary and Cilli’s most persistent enemy. Cilli was murdered by János Hunyadi’s son. Cilli had no heirs, and his house died with him.
