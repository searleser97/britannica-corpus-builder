Henry Fitzroy, 1st duke of Grafton,  (born September 1663—died  Oct. 9, 1690, Cork, County Cork, Ire.), the second illegitimate son of Charles II of England by Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. After some initial hesitation he was officially recognized and became “the most popular and most able of the sons of Charles II.”
He was provided for by a rich marriage in 1672 to Isabella, daughter and heiress of Henry Bennet, Earl of Arlington, and at that time was created Earl of Euston; in 1675 he was created Duke of Grafton. He was brought up as a sailor and saw military service on the European continent and in the Barbary states. At James II’s coronation he was lord high constable. During the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth he commanded the royal troops in Somerset, but in 1688, with John Churchill (afterward Duke of Marlborough), he seceded to William of Orange, in whose service he died after receiving a wound at the siege of Cork in Ireland. He was succeeded as 2nd duke by his son Charles (1682–1757).
