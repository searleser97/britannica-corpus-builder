Louis II, 3e duc de Bourbon, byname Louis the Good, French Louis le Bon,  (born 1337—died August 19, 1410), duke of Bourbon (from 1356), count of Clermont and of Forez. He was an ally of Bertrand du Guesclin, the Breton-French hero, and a staunch supporter of John II of France; when John was taken prisoner by the English at Poitiers, Bourbon became one of the hostages delivered to the English as a guarantee of the payment of the ransom. He returned to France in 1367 and again fought the English in Poitou and Guyenne (1368–70).
