Augustus,  (born July 31, 1526, Freiberg, Saxony—died February 12, 1586, Dresden, Saxony), elector of Saxony and leader of Protestant Germany who, by reconciling his fellow Lutherans with the Roman Catholic Habsburg Holy Roman emperors, helped bring the initial belligerency of the Reformation in Germany to an end. Under his administration Saxony enjoyed economic and commercial prosperity at a time when commerce in Germany as a whole was decaying.
Augustus succeeded to the electorate of Saxony and the leadership of Germany’s Protestant princes on the death of his brother Maurice in 1553. Almost immediately a change in Saxon policy took place. While his brother had been an active opponent of the Habsburgs in the Schmalkaldic League and sought to make his house (the Albertine branch of the Wettin dynasty) a great power in central Germany, Augustus was content to consolidate and develop his holdings. By so doing, he split the Protestant leadership. In 1555 he accepted the Peace of Augsburg, which stopped hostilities on religious grounds between Roman Catholic and Lutheran princes in Germany.
Augustus originally followed the religious doctrines of the Lutheran reformer Philipp Melanchthon. When he began to suspect several of his advisers of Calvinist leanings, however, he reacted with harsh and swift punishment. His hatred of Calvinism was strong, and from 1574 Saxony followed an orthodox form of Lutheranism. He waged a constant struggle for Glaubensreinheit (purity of religious belief) in his territories.
With the active encouragement and assistance of his wife, Princess Anna of Denmark (1532–85), Augustus transformed Saxony into a model state. His reorganization of the tax structure and reform of justice increased the state’s efficiency and solvency. Saxon wealth was further enhanced by his encouragement of production and trade. The development of mining and the manufacturing skills of Dutch Protestant immigrants did much to promote the state’s economic well-being.
