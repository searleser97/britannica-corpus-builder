Milan III (or I), in full Milan Obrenović,  (born Oct. 21, 1819, Kragujevac, Serbia—died  July 8, 1839, Belgrade), prince of Serbia in 1839.
On June 13, 1839, at age 19, Milan succeeded to the Serbian throne on the abdication of his father, Prince Miloš. Severely ill with tuberculosis, he took no part in government, which was managed by a three-man regency. After Milan died 25 days later, the regency continued to administer the country for nine months until his brother and successor, Michael III, arrived in Belgrade in March 1840.
