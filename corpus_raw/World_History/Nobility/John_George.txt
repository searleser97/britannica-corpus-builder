John George,   (born Sept. 11, 1525, Kölln an der Spree, Brandenburg—died  Jan. 18, 1598, new style, Kölln an der Spree), elector of Brandenburg who in 1571 succeeded his father, Joachim II. Under his rule the divided electorate was reunited. His economies earned him the surname Oekonom (Steward) and made him popular with the nobility, to whom he granted concessions at the expense of the peasant class. A Lutheran, John George welcomed Protestant refugees from France and the Netherlands, but refused to become involved in the religious wars of either country.
