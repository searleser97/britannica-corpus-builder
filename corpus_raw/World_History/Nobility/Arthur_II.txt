Arthur II,  (born 1262—died  1312, Château de l’Isle, near La Roche-Bernard, Brittany), duke of Brittany (1305–12), son of John II and Beatrice of England.
By successive marriages before his accession, he acquired the viscounty of Limoges (1275) and the county of Montfort-l’Amaury (1292). During his short reign, the war between Edward I of England and Philip IV of France was ended by treaty, whereby France ceded Brittany to England; but Arthur, with the vigorous support of the Bretons, defied and aborted the transfer. Arthur was succeeded by his son, John III the Good.
