Emanuel Shinwell, Baron Shinwell of Easington,  (born Oct. 18, 1884, London, Eng.—died  May 8, 1986, London), Labour politician who served in the British Parliament for over half a century, battling both Conservatives and his own party for socialist principles.
Shinwell left school at the age of 11 to become an apprentice tailor. In Glasgow, Scot., he first became active in trade-union work, and there, in 1919, he was jailed for five months for inciting dock workers to riot during a strike. He first served in the House of Commons in 1922–24 and 1928–31, representing a Scottish district; in 1935, enraged at Labour Party leader Ramsey MacDonald, he challenged the former prime minister in his own Durham district, winning election to Commons again. Among members of Parliament Shinwell became particularly well known for his savage wit, and he was a continually harsh critic of Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s conduct of World War II.
During Clement Attlee’s Labour government Shinwell served as minister of fuel and power (1945–47), beginning the nationalization of British mines and giving miners a five-day workweek; he later served as Attlee’s minister of defense (1950-51). During Harold Wilson’s 1964-70 Labour administration, Shinwell, in his 80s, was three times elected chairman of the parliamentary Labour Party. Though he strenuously enforced party discipline in support of Wilson, he bitterly fought British membership in the European Economic Community. Shinwell was made a life peer in 1970 and served actively in the House of Lords, where beginning in 1982 he sat with the independents, though remaining a Labourite, in protest against what he considered left-wing militancy. He continued to serve in Parliament until his death, at the age of 101.
