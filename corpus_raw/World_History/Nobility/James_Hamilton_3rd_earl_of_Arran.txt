James Hamilton, 3rd earl of Arran,  (born 1537?—died  March 1609), earl of Arran who was twice considered as a husband both for Mary Stuart and for Henry VIII’s daughter Elizabeth (afterward Elizabeth I). During his childhood these projects arose from his father’s ambitions; later, when he had returned from commanding the Scots guards in France (1554–59) and had joined the lords of the congregation, the Protestants proposed him as suitor first for the hand of Elizabeth, and then, after December 1560, for that of Mary. He showed signs of insanity in 1562, and the rest of his life was spent in confinement.
