Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart, also called (1916–22) Sir Gordon Hewart, or (1922–40) Baron Hewart of Bury,  (born Jan. 7, 1870, Bury, Lancashire, Eng.—died  May 5, 1943, Totteridge, Hertfordshire), lord chief justice of England from 1922 to 1940.
A scholar of University College, Oxford, Hewart was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1902 and practiced on the northern circuit. After an unsuccessful contest for a seat in Parliament in northwest Manchester in 1912, he was elected as a liberal for Leicester in 1913 and later represented the eastern division of that city. In December 1916 he was appointed solicitor general in David Lloyd George’s coalition government. He was made attorney general in January 1919 and was admitted to the cabinet in 1921. As law officer, Hewart played a leading part in a great deal of litigation arising under the Defence of the Realm Acts; while in the House of Commons he proved himself a powerful debater. He took an active part in the final phase of the negotiations with Sinn Feiners. He acted as president of the War Compensation Court from 1922.
Hewart was knighted in 1916; on Jan. 16, 1918, he was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council and, on March 24, 1922, was appointed lord chief justice; at the same time, he was created Baron Hewart of Bury. He resigned as chief justice in 1940 and in that year was created Viscount Hewart of Bury. As a judge, Hewart was prone to reach a decision too soon and on insufficient material and so seemed to take sides. His book The New Despotism (1929) was a powerful but not always temperate indictment of the quasijudicial powers granted to the executive and of the use made of them. On the other hand, champions of civil liberties approved of his opposition to governmental encroachments and bureaucratic restrictions.
