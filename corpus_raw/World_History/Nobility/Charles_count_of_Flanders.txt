Charles, byname Charles The Good,  French Charles Le Bon, Dutch Karel De Goede,  (born c. 1084—died  March 2, 1127, Bruges, Flanders), count of Flanders (1119–27), only son of St. Canute, or Canute IV of Denmark, by Adela, daughter of Robert I the Frisian, count of Flanders. After the assassination of Canute in 1086, his widow took refuge in Flanders, taking with her her son. Charles was brought up by his mother and grandfather, Robert the Frisian, on whose death he did great services to his uncle, Robert II, and his cousin, Baldwin VII, counts of Flanders. Baldwin died of a wound received in battle in 1119 and, having no issue, left by will the succession to his countship to Charles. Charles did not secure his heritage without a civil war, but he was speedily victorious and made his position secure by treating his opponents with great clemency. He now devoted himself to promoting the welfare of his subjects and did his utmost to support the cause of Christianity, both by his bounty and by his example. He refused the offer of the crown of Jerusalem on the death of Baldwin I and declined to be nominated as a candidate for the imperial crown in succession to the Holy Roman emperor Henry V. He was murdered on Ash Wednesday, 1127, in the church of St. Donat at Bruges.
