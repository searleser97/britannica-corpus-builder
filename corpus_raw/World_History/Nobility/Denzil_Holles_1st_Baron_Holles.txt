Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles, in full Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles of Ifield,  (born October 18, 1598, Haughton, Nottinghamshire, England—died February 17, 1680), English Presbyterian who was a leading but moderate parliamentary opponent of King Charles I. Later in his career he served in the government of Charles’s son King Charles II.
Elected to the House of Commons in 1624, Holles joined the critics of the crown. In the Parliament of 1628–29 he was one of the three members who—after the king had ordered adjournment—held the speaker of the House in his chair while three resolutions critical of Charles’s religious and economic policies were passed. In retaliation the king arrested Holles and imprisoned him until he paid (1630) a security pledging good behaviour.
During the 1630s Holles took no part in public life. He gained a seat in the Short and Long Parliaments that convened in 1640, and he provoked the king’s anger by his vigorous support for a bill to abolish bishops. On January 4, 1642, Charles attempted to arrest Holles and four other prominent Parliamentarians, but they evaded capture and returned in triumph to Parliament on January 11. Upon the outbreak (August 1642) of the Civil War between Parliament and the king, Holles raised his own infantry regiment. He fought with distinction at the Battle of Edgehill (October 23, 1642) but was badly defeated at the Battle of Brentford (November 11). In 1643 he became a leader of the peace party that sought a negotiated peace based on a limited monarchy and a presbyterian form of church government. After the split developed between the Presbyterian-controlled Parliament and the army, dominated by Independents, Holles fled to France in December 1648 to escape arrest by the army. Nevertheless, he was allowed to live in England during the Protectorate (1653–59).
When the Royalists again gained the upper hand in 1659, Holles became a member of the Council of State, and he played a leading role in the restoration of Charles II in 1660. He was admitted to Charles’s Privy Council in June 1660 and was created Baron Holles of Ifield in April 1661. Although Holles served Charles in ambassadorial missions in the 1660s, he supported the opposition party—soon to be known as the Whig Party—in Parliament during the 1670s. He was removed from the Privy Council in 1676 and subsequently supported the earl of Shaftesbury.
