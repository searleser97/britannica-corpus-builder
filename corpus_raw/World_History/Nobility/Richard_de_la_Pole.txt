Richard de la Pole,  (died Feb. 24, 1525, Pavia, Duchy of Milan), last Yorkist claimant to the English throne.
Pole was the youngest son of John de la Pole, 2nd duke of Suffolk (died 1491/92), and Elizabeth, sister to the Yorkist king Edward IV (ruled 1461–70, 1471–83). Since Edward IV’s brother and successor, Richard III, died childless and since Edward’s own sons disappeared in the Tower of London, the de la Poles inherited the Yorkist claim to the throne, a claim strengthened when Richard III named Suffolk’s eldest son John, earl of Lincoln (d. 1487), as his successor. After the accession in 1485 of the first Tudor, Henry VII, the family therefore lived under suspicion; nor did it help that Lincoln joined Lambert Simnel’s rebellion (1487), which cost him his life. The claim thus devolved upon the second brother, Edmund de la Pole, earl of Suffolk (1472?–1513). After years of waiting, Suffolk fled abroad in 1499; and though he returned briefly he fled again in 1501, this time accompanied by his brother Richard. The brothers tried to interest the emperor Maximilian in their cause, but in 1502 Maximilian agreed with Henry VII on terms that included dropping the Yorkist claimants. Suffolk, accused as a traitor in 1504, was imprisoned in Burgundy in that year and surrendered to Prince Henry (later Henry VIII) in 1506, on condition that his life be spared. He lived a prisoner in the Tower of London until Henry VIII carried out the old sentence against him in 1513.
Meanwhile, Richard had led an adventurous life, escaping (1504) the pressing attentions of his brother’s creditors at Aachen, taking service with King Vladislas (Ulászló) II of Hungary, and establishing something of a reputation as a condottiere. After Edmund’s death he took over the claim to the crown, calling himself duke of Suffolk. Although treated equivocally by Louis XII of France, he did find service with Louis’s successor, Francis I, who saw fit to use him as a weapon in his complex diplomacy. In 1523 he encouraged an intrigue that was meant to restore the Yorkist claimant to England with the help of an exiled claimant to the Scottish throne. Though nothing came of this, Richard de la Pole remained in Francis’ service, accompanied him to the war in Italy, and was killed in the Battle of Pavia (1525). His death terminated the claims of the main Yorkist line and ended a threat to the Tudor throne.
