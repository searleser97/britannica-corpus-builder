Henry Stafford, 2nd duke of Buckingham,  (born c. 1454—died  Nov. 2, 1483, Salisbury, Wiltshire, Eng.), a leading supporter, and later opponent, of King Richard III. He was a Lancastrian descendant of King Edward III, and a number of his forebears had been killed fighting the Yorkists in the Wars of the Roses (1455–85).
In 1460 he succeeded his grandfather as Duke of Buckingham, and six years later he was married to Catherine Woodville, sister-in-law of the Yorkist king Edward IV. Nevertheless, as a Lancastrian, Buckingham was excluded from almost all public activity during Edward IV’s reign. Upon Edward’s death on April 9, 1483, Buckingham moved to help Richard, duke of Gloucester, usurp the throne of the dead king’s son and successor, the 12-year-old king Edward V. Buckingham arrested several members of Edward V’s party and arranged for the seizure of Edward and his younger brother. He then publicly denied the legitimacy of Edward IV’s heirs and exhorted the people to make Gloucester their ruler. After the coronation of Gloucester as King Richard III on July 6, the duke was showered with honours and titles.
Within two months, however, Buckingham had begun plotting with the Lancastrians to overthrow Richard. The plan called for the elevation of the exiled Lancastrian Henry Tudor, earl of Richmond, to the kingship, but Buckingham may have intended ultimately to seize the crown for himself. He was possibly responsible at this time for the mysterious disappearance—and presumed murder—of Edward V and his brother. If so, he probably intended to eliminate two claimants to the throne and blame Richard for the crime. At any rate, in mid-October Buckingham moved with his troops into Herefordshire, but floods barred his passage to London, and in a few days his demoralized army broke up. Buckingham fled but was captured and beheaded.
