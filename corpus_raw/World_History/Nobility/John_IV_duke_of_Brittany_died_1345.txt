John (IV), byname John Of Montfort,  French Jean De Montfort,  (died 1345), claimant to the duchy of Brittany upon the death of his childless half brother, John III. He was the only surviving son of Arthur II. 
At first, John of Montfort had recognized John III’s designation of Charles of Blois (nephew of King Philip VI of France) as the successor; but then John of Montfort reneged, had himself crowned at a convocation of bishops and lords at Nantes, and thus started the War of the Breton Succession. John was supported by Edward III of England (who claimed suzerainty over Brittany), but Philip VI favoured his own nephew and captured John at Nantes (1341). John, however, escaped from prison and defeated Charles’s partisans at Cadoret (1345). When John himself died the same year, his widow, Joan of Flanders, defended the claims of his son, John IV.
Certain authorities count John of Montfort among the dukes of Brittany; he then becomes John IV, and his successors John V and John VI.
