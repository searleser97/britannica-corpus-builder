Henry II Jasomirgott,  (born c. 1114—died  Jan. 13, 1177, Vienna), the first duke of Austria, a member of the House of Babenberg who increased the dynasty’s power in Austria by obtaining the Privilegium Minus (a grant of special privileges and a reduction of obligations toward the empire) from the Holy Roman emperor Frederick I Barbarossa when Austria was raised to a duchy.
Henry received the rank of count palatine from the German king Conrad III, his half brother, in 1140, and, after the death of his brother Leopold IV in 1141, he was granted the margravate of Austria in fief. In 1142 Conrad negotiated Henry’s marriage with Gertrude, widow of Henry the Proud, the Welf duke of Bavaria and Saxony, and in 1143 Henry was granted the duchy of Bavaria.
On Gertrude’s death in April of that year, Henry the Lion, son of Henry the Proud, resumed the Welf claim to Bavaria. Conrad III supported Henry Jasomirgott’s cause, but Frederick I Barbarossa, who became German king in 1152, sided with Henry the Lion and in 1154 awarded Bavaria to him. Henry Jasomirgott (who, in the meantime, had married the Byzantine princess Theodora) refused to cede the duchy.
A compromise was reached in 1156, when, in return for the surrender of Henry Jasomirgott’s claim to Bavaria, Austria was raised to the status of a duchy, and, in addition, the ducal house of Austria (by the terms of the Privilegium Minus) was granted a number of special privileges. These included succession in either the male or the female line and the right of the duke to appoint his own successor if there was no heir. In addition, the Austrian duke was obliged to attend diets only when they were held in Bavaria and was liable for military service only in campaigns against Austria’s neighbours.
