Charles I, 5th duke de Bourbon,  (born 1401—died December 4, 1456), duke of Bourbon (from 1434) and count of Clermont. After having rendered notable services to Charles VII of France, he turned about and became—with Jean II, duke of Alençon—the leader of the short-lived Praguerie (1440), a revolt of nobles nominally led by the Dauphin (the future Louis XI). The nobles were cornered in the territory of Bourbon and made peace, given generous terms.
