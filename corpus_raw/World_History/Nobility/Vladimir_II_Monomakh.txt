Vladimir II Monomakh, in full Vladimir Vsevolodovich Monomakh,  (born 1053—died  May 19, 1125, near Kiev [now in Ukraine]), grand prince of Kiev from 1113 to 1125.
Vladimir was the son of Grand Prince Vsevolod I Yaroslavich (ruled Kiev 1078–93) and Irina, the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachus. He became active in the politics of Kievan Rus, helping his father and uncle Izyaslav I (ruled at Kiev intermittently 1054–78) defeat his cousins Oleg Svyatoslavich and Boris Vyacheslavich at Chernigov (1078; modern Chernihiv, Ukraine) and succeeding his father as prince of Chernigov when Vsevolod became grand prince of Kiev. Vladimir ruled Chernigov from 1078 to 1094, restoring order among his cousins in Volhynia (1084–86) and assuming a leading role among princes of Rus at the conferences held to avert perpetual warfare among themselves (1097 and 1100). When his cousin Grand Prince Svyatopolk II (ruled Kiev 1093–1113) died, the veche (city council) of Kiev named him successor.
During his reign, as prior to it, Vladimir was almost constantly involved in wars, fighting primarily the Polovtsy, who had settled in the steppe region southeast of the Kievan state and had been raiding the lands of Rus since 1061. In his “Testament,” which he wrote for his sons and which constitutes the earliest known example of Old Russian literature written by a layman, Vladimir recounted participating in 83 noteworthy military campaigns and recorded killing 200 Polovtsy princes. In addition to his martial qualities, Vladimir Monomakh was known as an adept administrator, whose ability to curtail the internecine warfare among his princely relatives revived, if only temporarily, the declining strength of Kievan Rus. He was also noted as a builder; he founded the city of Vladimir on the Klyazma River in northeastern Russia, which by the end of the 12th century replaced Kiev as the seat of the grand prince.
