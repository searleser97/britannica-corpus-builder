Ramon Berenguer I, byname Ramon Berenguer The Elder, Catalan Ramon Berenguer El Vell,  (born 1023/24—died  May 26, 1076, Barcelona? [Spain]), count of Barcelona from 1035 to 1076.
His father, Berenguer Ramon I (reigned 1018–35), divided and bequeathed his lands among his three sons. However, Sanç (or Sancho) in 1049 and Guillem (or William) in 1054 renounced their inheritances in their eldest brother’s favour, thus reuniting the lands. Ramon Berenguer I also expanded his domain by securing control over the adjacent counties of Ampurias and Pallars. His most noted achievement was convoking the local Cortes (assembly) and having it deliberate on a choice of Roman and medieval laws for Catalonia. The result was the promulgation of the celebrated legal code known as the Usatges de Barcelona (1064–68).
