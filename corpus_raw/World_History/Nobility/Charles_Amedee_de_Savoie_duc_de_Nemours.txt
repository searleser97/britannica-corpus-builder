Charles-Amédée de Savoie, duke de Nemours,  (born April 1624—died  July 30, 1652, Paris, France), son of Henri I de Savoie and ducal successor to his short-lived brother, Louis de Savoie.
Charles-Amédée married Elisabeth de Bourbon, daughter of the Duke de Vendome, in 1643. He commanded troops in the wars against the Spaniards in Flanders in 1645–46, fighting in many battles and being wounded in the leg at the Battle of Mardick. During the second phase (1650–53) of the Fronde, he took the side of the aristocratic rebels. He caused dissension among his coconspirators by flirting with the Duchess de Longueville and with Mme de Chatillon (Isabelle Angelique de Montmorency) and by quarreling with his brother-in-law, François, Duke de Beaufort, who shot him fatally in a duel.
