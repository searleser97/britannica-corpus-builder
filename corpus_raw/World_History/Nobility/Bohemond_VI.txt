Bohemond VI,  (born 1237—died 1275), prince of Antioch (1252–68) and count of Tripoli (1252–75).
The son of Bohemond V by Luciana, he succeeded his father in 1252. In 1250 his sister Plaisance had married Henry I of Cyprus, the son of Hugh I, and the Cypriot connection of Antioch was thus maintained. In 1252 Bohemond VI established himself in Antioch, leaving Tripoli to itself, and in February 1258 he procured the recognition of his nephew, Hugh II of Cyprus, as king of Jerusalem. In 1268 he lost Antioch to the Mamlūks. Thus fell the richest and oldest of the Crusader states.
