Boleslav III, byname Boleslav the Red or Boleslav the Blind, Czech Boleslav Ryšavý, or Boleslav Slepý,  (died 1037), prince of Bohemia 999 to 1002 and again in 1003, the eldest son and successor of Boleslav II. His incompetence bred troubles in Bohemia, and he was forced to flee in 1002 first to Germany and then to Poland. He made a brief return in 1003 with Polish help, murdered his enemies, and was again expelled. Falling into the hands of Bolesław I of Poland, he was blinded and kept in prison until his death.
