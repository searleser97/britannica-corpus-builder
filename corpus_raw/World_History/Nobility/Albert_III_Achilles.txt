Albert III Achilles,  (born November 24, 1414, Tangermünde, Brandenburg [now in Germany]—died  March 11, 1486, Frankfurt am Main), elector of Brandenburg, soldier, and administrative innovator who established the principle by which the mark of Brandenburg was to pass intact to the eldest son.
The third son of Frederick of Hohenzollern, elector of Brandenburg, Albert received his family’s Ansbach lands upon Frederick’s death in 1440. He added Bayreuth at his brother John’s death (1464), and when his brother Frederick II abdicated in 1470 he became elector of the mark of Brandenburg.
Throughout much of his life, Albert was engaged in warfare, harbouring a strong antipathy toward the relative autonomy of cities and towns, especially Nürnberg, which he tried to subdue several times. His administrative policy was more effective than his campaigns, however. On February 24, 1473, he proclaimed the Dispositio Achillea (“Disposition of Achilles”), which was to preserve Brandenburg as a united whole and keep his dynastic inheritance intact. This settlement gave the mark of Brandenburg to his eldest son and the Hohenzollerns’s then more lucrative Franconian possessions to younger sons. While not establishing primogeniture as such, he made a significant step in that direction.
Albert effectively administered his lands, combating aristocratic banditry, paying his officials salaries, tightening controls over them, and instituting an accounting system in his territories. In the German political sphere, he sided with the Habsburgs for most of his life. At the Frankfurt Reichstag (1486) he supported Maximilian I’s election as German king. He also worked for currency and judicial reform and Landesfrieden (“peace throughout the land”) for all of Germany.
