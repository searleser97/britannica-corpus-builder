Lucy Hay, countess of Carlisle, née Percy,  (born 1599—died November 5, 1660), intriguer and conspirator during the English Civil Wars, celebrated by many poets of the day, including Thomas Carew, William Cartwright, Robert Herrick, and Sir John Suckling.
The second daughter of Henry Percy, 9th earl of Northumberland, she married James Hay (the earl of Carlisle from 1622) and became a conspicuous figure at the court of Charles I. The king’s leading adviser, the earl of Strafford, valued highly her sincerity and services; but after his execution (1641), possibly in consequence of a revulsion of feeling at his abandonment by the court, she devoted herself to the interests of the Parliamentary leaders, to whom she communicated the king’s most secret plans and counsels. Her greatest achievement was the timely disclosure to Lord Essex of the king’s intended arrest of five members of Parliament, which enabled them to escape. But she may have served both parties simultaneously, betraying communications on both sides, and doing considerable mischief in inflaming political animosities.
In 1647 she attached herself to the interests of the moderate, or Presbyterian, party, which assembled at her house, and in the second Civil War she demonstrated great zeal and activity in the royal cause, pawned a pearl necklace for £1,500 in order to raise money for Lord Holland’s troops, established communications with Prince Charles during his blockade of the River Thames, and made herself the intermediary between the scattered bands of Royalists and the queen. In consequence, after the king’s execution her arrest was ordered on March 21, 1649, and she was imprisoned in the Tower, whence she maintained a correspondence in cipher with Charles through her brother, Lord Percy, until Charles went to Scotland. According to a Royalist newsletter, while in the Tower she was threatened with the rack in order to extort information. She was released on bail on September 25, 1650, but she appears never to have regained her former influence in the Royalist counsels and died, soon after the Restoration, of apoplexy.
