Adam Kazimierz, Prince Czartoryski,  (born December 1, 1734, Gdańsk, Poland—died March 19, 1823, Sieniawa [Poland]), a leading member of the princely Czartoryski family and a patron of the arts, education, and culture.
The son of Aleksander August Czartoryski, governor of Ruthenia, who gathered a great estate and founded prosperous workshops, Adam Kazimierz was educated in England and prepared to take over the Polish throne. But in the period when Poland was left without an elected king, Adam Kazimierz refused the crown (1763), which was accepted by his first cousin Stanisław August Poniatowski.
The interests of Adam Kazimierz were mainly literary and pedagogical. He founded periodicals and schools and became the first minister of education in a European country. By his efforts and those of his ambitious wife, Izabella Elzbieta, née Countess Flemming (1746–1835), their palace at Puławy became an important centre of culture competing with royal patronage in the support of Neoclassical architecture and Polish literature; this provided an excellent school for their sons and those of the local gentry. The economist P.-S. du Pont de Nemours taught there. After the downfall of Poland in 1795, Puławy, ruined in 1792–94 and rebuilt, became the shrine of the country’s past, mainly through Princess Izabella’s efforts.
