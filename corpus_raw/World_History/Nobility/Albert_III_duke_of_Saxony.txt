Albert III, also called Albert Animosus, or The Courageous, German Albrecht Der Beherzte,  (born July 27/31, 1443, Grimma, Saxony—died  Sept. 12, 1500, Emden, East Frisia), duke of Saxony, founder of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin, and marshal of the Holy Roman Empire.
Albert was the son of Frederick II, elector of Saxony. When he was 12 years of age, he and his brother Ernest were abducted by their father’s enemy, the Saxon noble Kunz von Kaufungen, who was quickly thwarted and executed. The incident is known as the Prinzenraub, and it became a popular subject for legend and literature, particularly for 16th-century German dramatists. On the death of their father, the brothers ruled their Saxon territories jointly until the Leipzig partition of 1485, when the lands were split between them.
In 1471 Albert’s candidature for the Bohemian throne had failed. Governor of the Netherlands for the Holy Roman emperors from 1488 to 1493, he was rewarded for this service in 1498 with the hereditary governorship of Friesland.
