Alonso de la Cueva, marqués de Bedmar,  (born 1572, Granada, Spain—died 1655, Oviedo), Spanish diplomat who was allegedly responsible for the “conspiracy of Venice” in 1618.
Nominated by Philip III of Spain as ambassador to the Venetian Republic (1607), he was made marqués de Bedmar in 1614. He used his diplomatic privileges to promote the plans of the Spanish viceroys of Naples and Milan and to increase Spanish power in Italy. Resolutely opposed to Bedmar’s activities, Venice fabricated an alleged conspiracy to seize the republic as a pretext for expelling him.
Philip then sent Bedmar to the Spanish Netherlands, where he served as first minister. In 1622 he was made a Roman Catholic cardinal, resigning the marquessate to his brother Juan. Thereafter he spent much of his career in Rome assisting in Spanish diplomatic representation to the Vatican. Late in his life he was made bishop of Málaga and of Oviedo.
