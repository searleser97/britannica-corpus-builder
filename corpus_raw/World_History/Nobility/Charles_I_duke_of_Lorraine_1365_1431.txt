Charles I (or II), byname Charles The Bold,  French Charles Le Hardi,  (born 1365—died  Jan. 25, 1431, Nancy, Lorraine [Germany; now in France]), duke of Lorraine and an ally of the Burgundian faction in the internal strife that divided France during the Hundred Years’ War. He succeeded in uniting Lorraine with the duchy of Bar.
Becoming duke in 1391, he followed his father’s example in allying Lorraine with the Burgundians. Thus he defeated Louis, Duke d’Orléans, at Champigneulles in 1407, acted as the duke of Burgundy’s representative at the Council of Constance in 1414, and entered Paris with the duke on July 24, 1418, bearing the title of constable of France. Because of disputes with the French king, Charles, in one of his wills, had forbidden his daughters to marry French subjects. In 1420, however, he married his daughter Isabella to René d’Anjou, heir to the duchy of Bar; and in 1425 he ensured the union of Bar and Lorraine by disinheriting his nephew and proclaiming female succession of the duchy of Lorraine.
