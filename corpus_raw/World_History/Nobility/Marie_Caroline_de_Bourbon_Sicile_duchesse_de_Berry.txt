Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchesse de Berry,  (born November 5, 1798, Caserta [Italy]—died April 16, 1870, Brunnsee, Austria), daughter of Francis I of the Two Sicilies, who in 1832 staged a brief rebellion in western France against the king, Louis-Philippe, in a vain attempt to gain the crown for her son, Henri Dieudonné, comte de Chambord. Her husband, the duc de Berry, a son of Charles X of France, had been assassinated in 1820. When Charles was overthrown in 1830, she tried to secure the succession for her son but was forced into exile. In 1832, disguised as a peasant, she crossed the French border from Italy and made her way to the Vendée, where she succeeded in instigating a brief but abortive insurrection (June 1832). She was arrested in Nantes November 7 and imprisoned at Blaye but was freed in July 1833 with the discovery of her recent marriage to an obscure Italian nobleman, Count Ettore Lucchesi-Palli, an act that exempted her from the French throne. She lived in Austria and Italy until her death.
