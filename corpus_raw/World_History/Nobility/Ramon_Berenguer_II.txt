Ramon Berenguer II, byname Ramon Berenguer the Towhead, Catalan Ramon Berenguer Cap d’Estopes,  (born c. 1053—died Dec. 5, 1082, between Barcelona and Gerona, Catalonia [Spain]), count of Barcelona who reigned jointly with his twin brother, Berenguer Ramon II, from 1076 to 1082.
Following up on the policies of their father, Ramon Berenguer I, they proceeded to build the defenses and repopulate the lands that he had conquered. In 1082, in a forest en route to Gerona, Ramon Berenguer II was murdered, probably by his brother, who was thereafter nicknamed “the Fratricide” (“el Fratricida”). Berenguer Ramon II, now sole master, took part in the civil wars of the Spanish Muslims and reconquered the Tarragona area (1091). He reigned until 1097, when, having lost a trial by combat that was intended to decide the question of his guilt in the crime attributed to him, he went on crusade to Jerusalem, where he died, probably in either 1097 or 1099.
