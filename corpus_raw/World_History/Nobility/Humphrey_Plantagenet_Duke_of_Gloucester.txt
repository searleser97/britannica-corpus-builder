Humphrey Plantagenet, duke of Gloucester,  (born 1391—died  Feb. 23, 1447, London, Eng.), English nobleman who was the first notable patron of England’s humanists. He became known as the “good Duke Humphrey,” but many historians, pointing to his unprincipled and inept political dealings, have questioned the appropriateness of the title.
The fourth son of King Henry IV, Humphrey was made Duke of Gloucester in 1414 by his brother King Henry V (ruled 1413–22), and from 1415 to 1420 he served in a series of campaigns in the Hundred Years’ War against France.
Upon the death of Henry V in 1422, Parliament decreed that Gloucester should serve as acting regent for the infant king Henry VI while the official regent, John, Duke of Bedford, was leading the troops in France. By 1425 Gloucester was embroiled in a bitter power struggle with his uncle, Henry Beaufort, chancellor and chief minister of the realm. This feud continued until, in the mid-1430s, Beaufort gained firm control over the government. On Feb. 18, 1447, Beaufort’s successor as first minister, William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, had Gloucester arrested. Five days later the duke died, probably of natural causes. The popular belief that he had been murdered led to widespread uprisings in 1450.
Gloucester was one of the first Englishmen to appreciate classical Greek and Roman literature. He provided extensive patronage to English and Italian humanists and presented a large part of his library to the University of Oxford.
