Amadeus VII, byname Amadeus The Red Count,  Italian Amedeo Il Conte Rosso, French Amédée Le Comte Rouge,  (born 1360, Chambéry, Savoy [now in France]—died  Nov. 1, 1391, Ripaille), count of Savoy (1383–91), during whose short rule the county of Savoy acquired Nice and other Provençal towns.
Son of Amadeus VI and Bonne of Bourbon, Amadeus married (1377) the daughter of Jean, duc de Berry, brother of the king of France. His father, the “Green Count,” wore his customary emerald-green livery at the wedding, and the groom earned his own sobriquet by wearing bright red. Invested with the traditional fief of Savoyard heirs apparent, the seigneury of Bresse (west of Geneva), he was soon embroiled in an intermittent six-year war against a vassal, Edward of Beaujeu, who refused him homage. In 1382 he led Savoyard troops against Flemish rebels at the Battle of Rozebeke.
Amadeus died suddenly at the castle of Ripaille, south of Lake Geneva, at the age of 31, apparently as a result of a doctor’s blunder.
