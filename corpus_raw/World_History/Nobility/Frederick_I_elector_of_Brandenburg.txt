Frederick I,  (born between August and November 1371, Nürnberg [Germany]—died Sept. 20, 1440, Cadolzburg, near Nürnberg), elector of Brandenburg from 1417, founder of the Brandenburg line of Hohenzollern.
He was the second son of Frederick V, burgrave of Nürnberg. After his father’s death, in 1398, he obtained Ansbach and, in 1420, on the death of his elder brother John, the principality of Bayreuth. In 1410 Sigismund, younger son of the Holy Roman emperor Charles IV, had appointed Frederick his representative in the election for the German throne, authorizing him to cast the Brandenburg vote. Frederick succeeded in having Sigismund elected German king and as a reward was appointed a governor of Brandenburg (July 8, 1411). He was formally given the electorate and margravate by Sigismund in 1417. In 1425 Frederick handed over the control of Brandenburg to his eldest son, John the Alchemist, returned to Franconia, and devoted the rest of his life to imperial affairs. Active in the negotiations with the Hussites as a champion of religious moderation, he helped bring about the pacts of Prague (1433) and Iglau (1436). He took part in the election of Frederick III as German king in 1440.
