Maximilian II Emanuel,   (born July 11, 1662, Munich—died  Feb. 26, 1726, Munich), elector of Bavaria from 1679 and an able soldier whose quest for dynastic aggrandizement led him into a series of wars, first as an ally of the House of Habsburg, later against it, an enmity that nearly cost him his holdings.
Maximilian Emanuel, the son of the elector Ferdinand Maria, came of age in 1680 and three years later joined Austria in its war against the Turks. The capture of Belgrade (1688) made his reputation. During the War of the Grand Alliance (1689–97), a coalition of most European powers against Louis XIV of France, he once again ranged himself on the Habsburgs’ side, and was appointed governor of the Spanish Netherlands (1692). Through his marriage to Maria Antonia (died 1692), a daughter of the emperor Leopold I, Maximilian Emanuel exercised some claim to the Habsburg succession; and his son, Joseph Ferdinand, was expected to inherit most of the Spanish possessions. After Joseph Ferdinand’s death in 1699 destroyed such hopes, Maximilian Emanuel for a number of years still hoped to retain the Spanish Netherlands, but his efforts were to remain futile. Although his marriage to Teresa Kunigunda Sobieska (1694) opened the possibility of the Polish succession after the death of John III (Jan Sobieski) in 1696, Maximilian Emanuel decided to remain in western Europe.
The War of the Spanish Succession (1701–13) found the elector on the French side in the hope that his dynasty, the Wittelsbachs, could supplant the Habsburgs on the imperial throne. After defeat of the French and Bavarians at Blenheim (1704), Maximilian Emanuel was driven from his country, and, after the Battle of Ramillies (1706), he also lost the Netherlands and became a refugee at the French court. Restored to Bavaria after the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), he returned to Munich in 1715. In 1724 he organized the Wittelsbach House Union to coordinate actions in German affairs. His eldest son, Charles Albert, finally realized Maximilian Emanuel’s dreams and became emperor in 1742.
