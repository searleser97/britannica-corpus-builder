Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen,  (born Sept. 22, 1835, Krauchenweis, Prussia—died June 8, 1905, Berlin, Ger.), Prussian candidate for the Spanish throne. He was a member of the Swabian line of the Hohenzollern dynasty and the brother of Carol I of Romania. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and Spain’s de facto leader, Juan Prim (1814–70), persuaded the reluctant Leopold to accept the Spanish throne, left vacant in 1868. Under French diplomatic pressure, Leopold’s candidacy was withdrawn, but Prussia refused to bow to French demands that it never be renewed. The Ems Telegram provoked the French into declaring war (see Franco-Prussian War).
