Louis-Armand I de Bourbon, prince de Conti,  (born April 4, 1661, Paris, France—died November 9, 1685, Fontainebleau), eldest surviving son of Armand I de Bourbon, prince of Conti; he succeeded his father in 1666. His marriage (1680) to Marie-Anne de Bourbon (1666–1739), daughter of Louis XIV and Louise de La Vallière, was the first union between a prince of the blood and one of the king’s natural children. He served with distinction in Flanders in 1683 and, against the wish of the king, went to Hungary, where he assisted the Imperialists to defeat the Turks at Gran in 1683. After a dissolute life he died at Fontainebleau from smallpox.
