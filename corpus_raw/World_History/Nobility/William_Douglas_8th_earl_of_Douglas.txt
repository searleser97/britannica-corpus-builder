William Douglas, 8th earl of Douglas,  (born c. 1425—died  Feb. 22, 1452, Stirling, Stirling, Scot.), prominent Scottish lord during the reign of James II of Scotland.
The so-called Black Douglases, of whom the 8th earl was a member, had lost their lands through accusations of treason; but the Earl recovered Galloway and Wigtown by marriage with his cousin, the heiress Margaret Douglas, the “Fair Maid of Galloway.” The estate of Bothwell was granted to him by James II, with whom he at first stood in high favour.
In 1450, however, James II raided the Earl’s lands during his absence on a pilgrimage to Rome; their relations seemed outwardly friendly, however, until 1452, when the King invited Douglas to Stirling Castle under a safe-conduct—in itself, however, a proof of strained relations. There James demanded the dissolution of a league into which Douglas had entered with Alexander Lindsay, the “Tiger,” 4th earl of Crawford. On Douglas’ refusal the King murdered him with his own hands, the courtiers helping to dispatch him.
