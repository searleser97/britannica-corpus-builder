Bohemond V,   (born c. 1198â€”died  January 1252), prince of Antioch and count of Tripoli from 1233 to 1252.
The son of Bohemond IV by his wife Plaisance, he succeeded his father in 1233 and carried on the struggle with Armenia until 1251, when the marriage of the future Bohemond VI to the sister of the Armenian king finally brought peace. By his first marriage (1225) with Alice, the widow of Hugh I of Cyprus, Bohemond V connected the history of Antioch for a time with that of Cyprus. He had resided chiefly at Tripoli, and under him Antioch was left to be governed by its commune, or town council.
