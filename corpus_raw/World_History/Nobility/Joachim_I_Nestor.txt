Joachim I Nestor,   (born Feb. 24, 1484—died  July 11, 1535, Kölln an der Spree, Brandenburg), elector of Brandenburg, an opponent of the Habsburg emperors, yet a devout Roman Catholic who prevented the spread of Protestantism in his lands during his lifetime.
Joachim at first supported Francis I of France at the imperial election of 1519 and at one point even hoped to attain the title himself, but he finally backed Charles I of Spain, who became Charles V. Relations between the Emperor and the Elector were never cordial, however, for Joachim remained a French sympathizer. In domestic affairs, he reformed the legal code and settled his warlike nobles by granting them lands and positions. Interested in humanistic studies, he founded a university at Frankfurt an der Oder in 1506. Joachim remained an implacable enemy of the Reformation and even forced his sons, who sympathized with the reformers, to pledge that Brandenburg would remain Catholic after his death. In his will, he divided Brandenburg between his two sons.
