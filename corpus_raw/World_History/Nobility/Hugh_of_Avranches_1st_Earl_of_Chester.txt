Hugh of Avranches, 1st earl of Chester, also called Hugh The Fat, or Hugh The Wolf,  French Hugues Le Gros, French-Latin Hugues Lupus,  (born c. 1047—died  July 27, 1101), son of Richard, Viscount d’Avranches, and probable companion of William the Conqueror, who made him Earl of Chester in 1071. (He inherited his father’s viscountship sometime after 1082.) He had special privileges in his earldom, and he held land in 20 counties. Hugh was called Le Gros because of his great bulk and Lupus because of his ferocity. He regarded Saint Anselm as his friend, and he showed the customary liberality to religious houses. His life was mainly spent fighting in Wales and in Normandy. Hugh’s only son Richard, who was childless, drowned in the White Ship (see William the Aetheling) in November 1120.
