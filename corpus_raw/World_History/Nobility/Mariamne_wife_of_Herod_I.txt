Mariamne,  (born c. 57—died 29 bc), Jewish princess, a popular heroine in both Jewish and Christian traditions, whose marriage (37 bc) to the Judean king Herod the Great united his family with the deposed Hasmonean royal family (Maccabees) and helped legitimize his position. At the instigation of his sister Salome and Mariamne’s mother, Alexandra, however, Herod had her put to death for adultery. Later, he also executed her two sons, Alexander and Aristobulus.
