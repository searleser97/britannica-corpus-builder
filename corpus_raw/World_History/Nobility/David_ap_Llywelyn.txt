David Ap Llywelyn,   (born c. 1208—died  Feb. 25, 1246, Aber, Gwynedd, Wales), Welsh prince, ruler of the state of Gwynedd in northern Wales from 1240 to 1246.
His father, Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, had made Gwynedd the centre of Welsh power, and his mother, Joan, was the illegitimate daughter of King John of England (ruled 1199–1216). Although Llywelyn designated David as his successor, his half brother Gruffudd opposed him. While the aged Llywelyn lay ill, David seized Gruffudd and imprisoned him (1239). Llywelyn died in April 1240, and in August 1241 David was forced by England’s King Henry III to cede part of his territory and surrender Gruffudd to the English. Henry planned to turn Gruffudd loose against David should the need arise, but in 1244 Gruffudd broke his neck and died while attempting to escape from the Tower of London. Freed of the threat from his rival, David went to war against Henry, declaring himself prince of Wales—the first Welsh ruler to adopt this title. David fell ill and died while the fighting was in progress. Because he left no heirs, the sons of Gruffudd ruled Gwynedd until Wales fell to the English in 1283.
