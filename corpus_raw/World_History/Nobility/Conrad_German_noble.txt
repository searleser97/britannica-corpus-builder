Conrad, also called Conrad The Red,  German Konrad Der Rote,  (died Aug. 10, 955, near Augsburg, Ger.), duke of Lotharingia (Lorraine) from 944 to 953 and ancestor of the Salian dynasty of German kings.
Conrad belonged to a family of Franconian counts with rich lands in the country around Speyer and Worms. After helping King (later Emperor) Otto I suppress a rebellion of his vassals (937–939), he was given the duchy of Lotharingia (944) and Otto’s daughter Liudgard in marriage. Later he fell out with the king and joined Otto’s son Liudolf of Swabia in a rebellion (953–954). Forced to submit, Conrad lost his duchy but not his lands in Franconia or his vassals. Later reunited with the king, he fought and was killed in the Battle of Lechfeld, when the largest Hungarian army to invade German lands was destroyed. His services seem to have been decisive in securing this victory for Otto.
