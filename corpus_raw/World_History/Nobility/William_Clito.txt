William Clito, French Guillaume Cliton,  (born c. 1101—died  July 28, 1128, Aalst, Flanders [now in Belgium]), count of Flanders and titular duke of Normandy (as William IV, or as William III if England’s William Rufus’ earlier claim to the duchy is not acknowledged).
Son of Duke Robert II Curthose (and grandson of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders), William Clito was supported by Louis VI of France in claiming the duchy when his father was imprisoned (1106) by the English. Henry I of England, however, had his own son William the Aetheling recognized as heir to Normandy and, in 1119, decisively defeated Louis VI and Clito at Bremule. When the Aetheling was drowned (1120), Clito made further trouble in Normandy. Although Clito was Louis VI’s candidate for the countship of Flanders in 1127, he died in 1128.
