Baldwin I, byname Baldwin Iron-arm, French Baudouin Bras-de-fer, Flemish Boudewijn De Ijzere Arm,  (died 879), the first ruler of Flanders. A daring warrior under Charles II the Bald of France, he fell in love with the kingâ€™s daughter Judith, the youthful widow of two English kings, married her (862), and fled with his bride to Lorraine. Charles, though at first angry, was at last conciliated, and made his son-in-law margrave (Marchio Flandriae) of Flanders (864), which he held as a hereditary fief. The Norsemen were at this time continually devastating the coastlands, and Baldwin was entrusted with this outlying borderland in order to defend it. He was the first of a line of strong rulers of Flanders, who early in the 10th century exchanged the title of margrave for that of count.
