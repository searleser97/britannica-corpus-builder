Igor Svyatoslavich,  (born 1150—died  1202), prince of the Russian lands of Novgorod-Seversky (modern Novhorod-Siverskyy, Ukraine) after 1178 and of Chernigovsky (1198–1202; modern Chernihiv, Ukraine), who led an unsuccessful campaign against the Cumans (Polovtsy) in 1185.
During the 12th century the southern and western Russian principalities were continually invaded and devastated by the nomadic Cumans. Svyatoslav III, cousin of Igor and prince of Kiev, inflicted a severe defeat upon them in 1183. But two years later Igor, the son of Svyatoslav, prince of Chernigovsky (d. 1164), led his son Vladimir of Putivl, his brother Vsevolod of Trubchevsk, and their nephew Svyatoslav Olgovich of Rylsk on another expedition against the nomads. After traveling from Novgorod-Seversky to the Donets River, they continued into the steppes, where they engaged the Cumans in a three-day battle (May 1185). Igor’s forces were completely defeated; all four princes were captured, and the Cumans were able to resume their raids upon Russian territory.
In 1186 Igor escaped from captivity and returned to Novgorod-Seversky, where he resumed his rule but drifted into relative insignificance. His campaign was not only described in the Russian chronicle but also became the subject of a major epic poem of old Russian literature, Slovo o polku Igoreve (“The Song of Igor’s Campaign”), presumably written by a member of Igor’s force.
