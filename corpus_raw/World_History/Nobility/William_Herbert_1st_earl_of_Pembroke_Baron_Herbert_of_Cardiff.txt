William Herbert, 1st earl of Pembroke, also called (until 1551) Sir William Herbert,  (born c. 1506—died March 17, 1570, Hampton Court, near London, Eng.), the earl of Pembroke of the second Herbert creation, a leading figure in the reigns of Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I of England. His father, Sir Richard Herbert, was an illegitimate son of William, the 1st earl of Pembroke of the first creation. Sir William’s first wife, Anne Parr, was a sister of Catherine Parr, who married Henry VIII in 1543.
In January 1544 Sir William was granted the rich estates formerly belonging to Wilton Abbey. Appointed a governor to the young king Edward VI, Sir William helped to suppress the rebellion in Wiltshire, Devon, and Cornwall in 1549. In October 1551 he was created Baron Herbert of Cardiff and earl of Pembroke. After Edward VI’s death he did homage to Lady Jane Grey but withdrew his allegiance in time to attend the proclamation of Mary I in London. Mary made him a privy councillor, and he led her troops against the rebel Sir Thomas Wyatt early in 1554.
On the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, Pembroke continued as a member of the privy council, and, from 1568 until his death, he served as steward of the royal household. Imprisoned in September 1569 for having favoured a proposed marriage between Mary Stuart and Thomas Howard, 4th duke of Norfolk, he was released shortly afterward. He was succeeded by his son Henry, the 2nd earl (c. 1538–1601).
