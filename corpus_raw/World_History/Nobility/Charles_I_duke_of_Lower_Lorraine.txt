Charles I,  (born 953—died  May 21, 992?, Orléans, Fr.), duke of Lower Lorraine, head of the only surviving legitimate line of the Carolingian dynasty by 987, and an unsuccessful claimant for the French throne.
Son of Louis IV of France and Gerberga, sister of Otto I of Germany, Charles was banished by his brother, King Lothar, in 977. Receiving the duchy of Lower Lorraine from Otto II of Germany in the same year, he conspired unsuccessfully with Otto to dethrone Lothar but then reversed his policy, made peace with Lothar, and plotted against the new German king, Otto III. After the deaths of Lothar (986) and Lothar’s son and successor Louis V (987), Charles asserted his claim to the French throne. But Adalbero, archbishop of Reims, convinced the assembly of Frankish nobles that the Frankish crown was elective rather than hereditary and that Charles was unworthy of the kingship. The assembly then proclaimed Hugh Capet king of France.
Charles did not abandon his claim but, in 991, was seized and handed over to Hugh, who kept him in prison until his death. One son, Otto, succeeded him as duke of Lower Lorraine, dying about 1012; two other sons died obscurely. With them the legitimate male line of the Carolingians came to an end.
