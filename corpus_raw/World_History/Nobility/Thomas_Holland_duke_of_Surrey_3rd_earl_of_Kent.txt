Thomas Holland, duke of Surrey, also called Thomas De Holand,  (born 1374—died  Jan. 7/8, 1400, Cirencester, Gloucestershire, Eng.), prominent English noble in the reign of Richard II.
Son of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent (1350–97), he aided in the arrest and destruction of Richard II’s enemies and was awarded with the dukedom of Surrey in 1397. In 1398 he was created marshal of England and given large estates, and, later in the same year, he was made the king’s lieutenant in Ireland.
After Henry IV seized power in September 1399, Surrey, along with other advisers of the former king, was temporarily arrested. On November 6 he was deprived of his dukedom. He then joined in a conspiracy against Henry but was betrayed and, while in flight, was seized by a mob and beheaded.
