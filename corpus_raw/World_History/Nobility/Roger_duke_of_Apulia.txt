Roger, byname Roger Borsa,  Italian Ruggiero Borsa,  (born c. 1060—died  1111), Norman duke of Apulia from 1085 to 1111, son of Robert Guiscard. His succession to his father’s lands and title in 1085 led to a conflict with his half brother Bohemond de Hauteville. (See Bohemond I).
Roger was the son of Robert Guiscard by Robert’s second marriage—to Sigelgaita, sister of the Lombard prince Gisulf of Salerno. Roger was called Borsa (“Purse”), to distinguish him from his uncle, Count Roger I of Sicily. With his brother Guy and his half brother Bohemond, Roger participated in Robert Guiscard’s capture of Byzantine Corfu, off the coast of Greece, in 1083. At Sigelgaita’s instigation, Robert named Roger Borsa as his heir rather than Bohemond, the son of his Norman first wife; and, when Robert died suddenly in 1085, Roger Borsa succeeded to the dukedom. His position was contested by Bohemond, who revolted and seized part of his father’s territory. The quarrel continued until 1095, when Bohemond left on crusade.
Roger Borsa was a weak ruler who, in spite of the support of the pope and of Count Roger, presided over the gradual disintegration of the duchy of Apulia.
