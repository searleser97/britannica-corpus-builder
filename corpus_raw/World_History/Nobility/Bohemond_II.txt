Bohemond II,  (born 1107â€”died February 1130), prince of Antioch from 1119 to 1130.
The son of Bohemond I and Constance of France, he went from Apulia to Antioch in 1126. Antioch had been under the regency of Baldwin II of Jerusalem since 1119, when the previous prince, Roger, had been killed. Soon after his arrival in Antioch, Bohemond married Alice, the younger daughter of Baldwin. After joining with Baldwin in an attack on Damascus (1129), he was slain in Cilicia by a Muslim army. The local emir had his severed head embalmed and sent as a gift to the caliph.
