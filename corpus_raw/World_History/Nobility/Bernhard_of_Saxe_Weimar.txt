Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar,  (born Aug. 16, 1604, Weimar, Saxe-Weimar—died July 18, 1639, Neuenburg, Breisgau), duke of Saxe-Weimar (Sachsen-Weimar), a politically ambitious Protestant general during the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48). One of the most successful field commanders of his age, he won a number of important victories over the forces of the Austrian Habsburgs.
Having served in the armies of the Rhenish Palatinate, Baden, and Denmark (1622–31), Bernhard joined Gustavus II Adolphus, the Swedish king, in 1631. An able officer, he had progressed from colonel of the King’s guards to general by 1632, and, on Gustavus’ death at the Battle of Lützen (Nov. 16, 1632), he took command and decided the battle against the forces of the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand II. He and the Swedish general Gustav Horn then invaded southern Germany. He was awarded the duchy of Franconia for victories that helped bring about the downfall of the Emperor’s general Albrecht Wenzel von Wallenstein.
Quarrelling with Horn and Swedish chancellor Count Axel Oxenstierna, both of whom advocated a defensive strategy, Bernhard lost his newly acquired territories after his and Horn’s defeat at the decisive Battle of Nördlingen (Sept. 5–6, 1634). In 1635 he pledged himself to the French crown in return for the landgraviate of Alsace and the bailiwick of Hagenau. Operating in southwestern Germany, he captured Rheinfelden, Freiburg, and the key fortress of Breisach (Dec. 17, 1638), effectively breaking the Austrian and Spanish stranglehold around France. When he died suddenly of smallpox or typhoid, Cardinal de Richelieu took over his army and territories for France.
