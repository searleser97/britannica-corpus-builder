Maximilian III Joseph,  (born March 28, 1727, Munich [Germany]—died December 30, 1777, Munich), elector of Bavaria (1745–77), son of the Holy Roman emperor Charles VII. By the Peace of Füssen signed on April 22, 1745, he obtained restitution of his dominions lost by his father—on condition, however, that he formally acknowledge the Pragmatic Sanction and not seek the imperial title. He was a man of the Enlightenment, did much to encourage agriculture, industries, and the exploitation of minerals, founded the Academy of Sciences at Munich, and abolished the Jesuit censorship of the press. At his death, without issue, the Bavarian line of the Wittelsbachs became extinct, and the succession passed to Charles Theodore, the elector Palatine.
