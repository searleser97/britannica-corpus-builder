Leofric,  (died Aug. 31, 1057, Bromley, Eng.), Anglo-Saxon earl of Mercia (from 1023 or soon thereafter), one of the three great earls of 11th-century England, who took a leading part in public affairs. On the death of King Canute in 1035, Leofric supported the claim of Canuteâ€™s son Harold to the throne against that of Hardecanute; and, during the quarrel between Edward the Confessor and Earl Godwine in 1051, he played the part of a mediator. Through his efforts civil war was averted, and in accordance with his advice the settlement of the dispute was referred to the Witan.
Because Chester was his principal residence and the seat of his government, he is sometimes called Earl of Chester. His wife was Godgifu, famous in legend as Lady Godiva (q.v.). Both husband and wife were noted as liberal benefactors to the church, among their foundations being the famous Benedictine monastery at Coventry.
