Henri I de Savoie, duc de Nemours, also called (until 1595) marquis de Saint-Sorlin,  (born November 2, 1572, Paris, France—died July 10, 1632, Paris), brother and successor of the former duke, Charles-Emmanuel.
Henri had helped the Roman Catholic Savoyards to capture Saluzzo (1588) and had fought for the Holy League in Daupiné, of which he became governor in 1591. Becoming duc de Nemours in 1595, he submitted the following year to King Henry IV. After taking part in campaigns at Rouen and Amiens, he retired to his estates at Annecy. When the Spanish went to war against Savoy in 1615, however, Nemours raised an army to cooperate with them, but he had to make peace in 1616. In 1618 he married Anne de Lorraine-Aumale, the only child of the duc d’Aumale. He passed the rest of his life in Paris, brilliant at court as a patron of ballet and the arts.
