Louis-Armand II de Bourbon, prince de Conti,  (born Nov. 10, 1695, Paris—died  May 4, 1727, Paris), only surviving son of François-Louis, the Great Conti. He was treated with great liberality by Louis XIV and also by the regent, Philippe, duc d’Orléans. He served under Marshal Villars in the War of the Spanish Succession, but he lacked the soldierly qualities of his father. In 1713 he married Louise-Élisabeth (1693–1775), daughter of Louis-Henri de Bourbon, 7th prince of Condé, and granddaughter of Louis XIV. He was a prominent supporter of the financial schemes of John Law, by which he made large sums of money.
