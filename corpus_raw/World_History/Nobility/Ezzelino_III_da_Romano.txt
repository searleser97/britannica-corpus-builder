Ezzelino III da Romano,  Ezzelino also spelled Eccelino,  (born April 25, 1194—died  Oct. 1, 1259, Soncino, Lombardy), Italian noble and soldier who was podestà (chief governing officer) of Verona (1226–30, 1232–59), Vicenza (1236–59), and Padua (1237–56). A skilled commander and successful intriguer, he expanded and consolidated his power over almost all northeast Italy by aiding the Holy Roman emperor Frederick II and the pro-imperial Ghibellines in their struggle against the papalist party, the Guelfs. His legendary cruelty is dealt with in Dante’s Inferno.
Given Trevignano by his father in 1223, Ezzelino allied himself with other local nobles and seized Verona two years later. After becoming podestà of the city in 1226, he at first favoured the Lombard League in its struggle with the emperor Frederick II. As the result of the league’s endeavours to reconcile various factions, Ezzelino resigned as podestà (1230). When political considerations persuaded him to join Frederick, he recaptured Verona in 1232. His position was constantly menaced by the neighbouring cities of Mantua, Padua, and Brescia, but the arrival of imperial troops in May 1236 and of Frederick himself in August assured the despot’s suzerainty.
Thereafter Ezzelino rapidly expanded his power. In November 1236 he aided the Emperor in subduing Vicenza, which was mercilessly pillaged. A few months later he took Padua himself. Having helped Frederick gain the important victory over the Lombards at Cortenuova (1237), he was the next year given the hand of Frederick’s illegitimate daughter Selvaggia. In the name of the Emperor, Ezzelino began the elimination of his own enemies, some of whom were loyal to Frederick.
When Frederick died in 1250, Ezzelino was sufficiently powerful to maintain his territories. After excommunicating him as a heretic, Pope Innocent IV mounted a crusade against him. Supported by Venice, the pro-papal Guelfs took Padua in 1256. Although Ezzelino captured Brescia in 1258, two powerful allies subsequently defected to the Guelfs. Ezzelino failed to seize Milan and was wounded and captured in battle at Cassano in September 1259. Refusing food or medical aid, he died four days later. He is the subject of the Latin tragedy Ecerinis by the Paduan poet Albertino Mussato.
