Richard I, byname Richard the Fearless, French Richard sans Peur,  (born c. 932—died 996), duke of Normandy (942–996), son of William I Longsword.
Louis IV of France took the boy-duke into his protective custody, apparently intent upon reuniting Normandy to the crown’s domains, but in 945 Louis was captured by the Normans, and Richard was returned to his people. Richard withstood further Carolingian attempts to subdue his duchy and, in 987, was instrumental in securing the French crown for his brother-in-law, the Robertian Hugh Capet.
