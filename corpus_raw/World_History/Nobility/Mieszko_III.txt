Mieszko III, byname Mieszko the Old, Polish Mieszko Stary,  (born 1126/27—died  March 13, 1202), prince of Great Poland from 1173 to 1177 and, during a period of civil war, in 1190/91 and 1194. The brother and successor of Bolesław IV, he was so brutal and despotic that he provoked a revolt of the magnates, who drove him out and tried, with mixed success, to replace him with his brother Casimir II.
