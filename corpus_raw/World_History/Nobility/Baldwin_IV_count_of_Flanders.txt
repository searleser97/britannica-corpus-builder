Baldwin IV, byname Baldwin the Bearded, French Baudouin le Barbu, Flemish Boudewijn met de Baard,  (born c. 980—died  May 30, 1035), count of Flanders (988–1035) who greatly expanded the Flemish dominions. He fought successfully both against the Capetian king of France, Robert II, and the Holy Roman emperor Henry II. Henry found himself obliged to grant to Baldwin IV in fief Valenciennes, the burgraveship of Ghent, the land of Waes, and Zeeland. The count of Flanders thus became a feudatory of the empire as well as of the French crown. The French fiefs are known in Flemish history as Crown Flanders (Kroon-Vlaanderen), the German fiefs as Imperial Flanders (Rijks-Vlaanderen). Baldwin’s son—afterward Baldwin V—rebelled in 1028 against his father at the instigation of his wife, Adela, daughter of Robert II of France; two years later peace was sworn at Oudenaarde, and the old count continued to reign until his death.
