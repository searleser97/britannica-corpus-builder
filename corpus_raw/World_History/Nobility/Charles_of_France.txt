Charles Of France,   (born Dec. 28, 1446—died  May 28, 1472), duke of Berry, of Normandy, and of Guyenne, who fought in the coalitions against his brother King Louis XI of France.
The last son of King Charles VII, Charles of France was given the duchy of Berry on his father’s death in 1461. Pressed by councillors, however, the young prince allied himself with Charles the Bold of Burgundy, the dukes of Brittany and Bourbon, and other nobles in the League of the Public Weal (1465), all of whom sought to resist King Louis’s severe and arbitrary attempts to reduce their power. After chasing Charles of France from Normandy (1466), the King gave him the duchy of Guyenne (1469). Charles died as another coalition was being formed (1472); Louis XI was accused of having had him poisoned, but no proof ever developed.
