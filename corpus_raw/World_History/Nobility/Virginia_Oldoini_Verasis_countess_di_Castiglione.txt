Virginia Oldoini Verasis, countess di Castiglione,  (born March 22, 1835, Florence, duchy of Tuscany [Italy]—died  Nov. 28, 1899, Paris, France), Tuscan noblewoman who occupied a predominant position in the courts of both Turin and Paris and influenced Franco-Italian political relations.
Married in 1854 to Count Francesco Verasis di Castiglione, who was attached to the court of King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia-Piedmont (later of Italy), she possessed a charm that, along with her sharp wit, gained her an influential position in the society of Turin, which called her “la divina contessa.” The Italian prime minister Count di Cavour, understanding the political possibilities of such a captivating woman, sent her to Paris in February 1856.
The countess quickly won the heart of the French court of Napoleon III, upon whom she exercised considerable influence. She is said to have contributed to the Franco-Sardinian alliance, although her precise political impact remains obscure. Her diplomatic correspondence is believed to have been destroyed by the Italian government.
Having fallen into disfavour in 1860, for unclear reasons, she withdrew from Paris. She returned a year later but had lost much of her influence. The Parisian society she had known fell in 1870 along with the French Empire, and the countess lived in retreat in Paris until her death.
During the last four decades of her life, the countess commissioned photographic portraits of herself from photographer Pierre-Louis Pierson of the fashionable Paris studio Mayer & Pierson. The photographs were later collected in La Divine Comtesse: Photographs of the Countess de Castiglione (2000).
