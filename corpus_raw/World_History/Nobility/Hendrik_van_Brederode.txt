Hendrik van Brederode,  (born Dec. 20, 1531, Brussels, Spanish Netherlands [now in Belgium]—died  Feb. 15, 1568, Harenburg Castle near Recklinghausen, Westphalia [Ger.]), Dutch nobleman and a leader in the early phases (1564–68) of the revolt of the Netherlands against Spanish rule.
The scion of an ancient Dutch family, which from 1418 had held the lordship of Vianen south of Utrecht, Brederode became known as a spirited soldier and succeeded to the family titles in 1556. In 1564 he joined the league of great nobles that successfully petitioned Philip II of Spain to remove Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, virtual head of the government, from the Netherlands.
Angered at monarchical infringement on his traditional noble privileges, Brederode in December 1565 became a leader of the league of lesser nobles (Geuzen), who had taken the initiative from the divided higher nobility. He led a delegation to the regent Margaret of Parma in April 1566 to petition for relaxation of edicts against Protestants. Although an accord was reached, the Calvinist attacks on Roman Catholic churches in August 1566 provoked Margaret to organize a military repression of dissident Calvinists and to demand an oath of allegiance from the nobility.
Brederode, who had already introduced the Reformed religion into his town of Vianen, refused the oath and began recruiting troops in Vianen and Antwerp. He became the chief military leader of the rebels when William, Prince of Orange (William I the Silent), wavered. The rebel movement was then temporarily halted when William and several other stadtholders held Calvinist uprisings in check and when Margaret’s armies gained key victories. Forced into exile in April 1567, Brederode went to Cleves and traveled elsewhere in northern Germany trying to assemble an army. He died before he could raise the necessary funds.
