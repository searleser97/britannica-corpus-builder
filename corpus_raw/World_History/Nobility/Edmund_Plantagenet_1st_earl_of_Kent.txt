Edmund Plantagenet, 1st earl of Kent, byname Edmund Of Woodstock,  (born Aug. 5, 1301, Woodstock, Oxfordshire, Eng.—died  March 19, 1330, Winchester, Hampshire), youngest brother of England’s King Edward II, whom he supported to the forfeit of his own life.
He received many marks of favour from his brother, whom he steadily supported until the last act in Edward’s life opened in 1326. He fought in Scotland and then in France and was a member of the council when Edward III became king in 1327. Soon at variance with Queen Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer, Edmund was involved in a conspiracy to restore Edward II, who he was led to believe was still alive (he had been murdered in September 1327); Edmund was arrested and beheaded. Although he had been condemned as a traitor, his elder son Edmund (c. 1327–33) was recognized as earl of Kent in December 1330, the title passing on his death to his brother John (c. 1330–52).
