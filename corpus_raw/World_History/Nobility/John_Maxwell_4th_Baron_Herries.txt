John Maxwell, 4th Baron Herries, also called (until 1566) Sir John Maxwell Of Terregles, Master Of Maxwell,  (born c. 1512—died  Jan. 20, 1583, Edinburgh, Scot.), a leading supporter of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, respected for his loyalty to the Scottish crown.
Herries was known as Maxwell of Terregles until he acquired his title in 1566. By that time he was a staunch adherent of the Roman Catholic queen, although he had previously supported Protestantism for political reasons. He led Mary’s cavalry against the Scottish rebels in the Battle of Langside (May 13, 1568) and, after her defeat, gave her temporary refuge. Herries is sometimes considered a dupe of Mary’s English enemies for his part in persuading her to submit her case (in the matter of the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley) to the judgment of Elizabeth I of England. The inability to reach agreement with her half-brother, James Stewart, Earl of Moray, over a political settlement led to Mary’s detention in England for the rest of her life. In 1578 Herries helped to force the resignation of James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, regent of Scotland during Mary’s captivity.
