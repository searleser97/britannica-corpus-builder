Corso Donati,  (died Oct. 6, 1308, Florence [Italy]), Florentine nobleman and soldier who formed and led the political faction known as the Blacks (Neri). He was master of Florence from 1301 to 1308.
Of a prominent Guelf (pro-papal) family, Donati acquired much influence in the Florentine government, especially after his victory over the citizens of Arezzo at Campaldino (1289). He then formed the party of the Blacks, supported by the aristocracy, against the party of the Whites (Bianchi), which wished to exclude the nobles from office. In 1300, however, the signoria, the ruling body of Florence, seeking to bring peace to the city, exiled both Donati and Vieri dei Cerchi, chief of the Whites. Donati fled to Rome under the protection of Pope Boniface VIII. Securing the aid of Charles of Valois (1270â€“1325), he returned in triumph to Florence in 1301 and controlled it until 1308. Although he twice banished the Whites (1304 and 1308), his enemies were not yet routed. When he plotted for a second time to become signore (lord) of Florence, a popular uprising resulted, and he died attempting escape.
