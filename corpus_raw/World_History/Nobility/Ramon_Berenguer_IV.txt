Ramon Berenguer IV, byname Ramon Berenguer the Holy, Catalan Ramon Berenguer el Sant,  (born c. 1113—died  Aug. 6, 1162, Borgo San Dalmazzo, Piedmont [Italy]), count of Barcelona from 1131 to 1162, regent of Provence from 1144 to 1157, and ruling prince of Aragon from 1137 to 1162.
The elder son of Ramon Berenguer III, he continued his father’s crusading wars against the Almoravid Muslims. The kingdom of Aragon soon sought Ramon Berenguer IV’s aid against Castile. In the course of their negotiations, he was promised the hand of the Aragonese king Ramiro II’s daughter and heir, Petronila (Peronella); they were married on Aug. 11, 1137, and a few months later (November 13), Ramiro II abdicated in favour of his daughter and son-in-law. Ramon Berenguer IV thus became the last count of Barcelona to take this as his principal title, for, from 1137, he was also ruler of Aragon (though he himself never assumed the title of king). From the reign of his son, who in 1162 succeeded him with the title of Alfonso II, the counts of Barcelona styled themselves, in the first place, kings of Aragon.
When Ramon Berenguer IV’s father had died, he had left the county of Provence to a younger son. When this son died, his brother Ramon Berenguer IV acted as regent (conventionally with the title Ramon Berenguer II of Provence) until the legitimate heir, his young nephew, reached majority in 1157, as Ramon Berenguer III of Provence. When this count of Provence died in 1166 without a male heir, he was succeeded by Ramon Berenguer IV’s son Alfonso II, king of Aragon. By his wars and conquests from the Moors—Tortosa (1148), Lerida, Mequinenza, and Fraga (1149), and Prades and Siurana (1153)—Ramon Berenguer IV definitively established the boundaries of the principality of Catalonia.
