Peter I, Montenegrin in full Petar Petrović Njegoš,  (born c. 1747, Njeguši, Montenegro—died October 18 [October 30, New Style], 1830, Cetinje), the great vladika, or prince-bishop, of Montenegro from 1782 to 1830, who won full independence of his country from the Turks.
As successor to his saintly but inept uncle Sava, Peter became the reigning prince in theocratic Montenegro in 1782 and was consecrated bishop two years later. To cement relations with Russia, always a potential ally against the Turks, he visited Russia that same year. On his return he found his land was being overrun by the forces of the pasha of Scutari. Uniting his warlike clans, he drove the invaders out. War with the Turks flared up periodically, sometimes with, and sometimes without, a powerful ally such as Russia or Austria. In 1796 a second invasion by the pasha of Scutari led to a series of brilliant victories over the Turks, with Peter leading his men. The pasha was captured and beheaded, and by a treaty in 1799 Sultan Selim III was forced to recognize the independence of Montenegro. New territories were added, including Brda, recently settled by Serbs from Hercegovina, which was to double the size of Montenegro during Peter’s reign.
During the Napoleonic Wars, Montenegro became involved in the struggle between the great powers. When by the Treaty of Pressburg with Austria (1805) the French took over Dalmatia, Peter allied himself first with the Russians until 1807 and then with the British in 1813 to maintain Montenegrin occupation of the town and Gulf of Kotor. After the French left in 1813, the territory was annexed by Peter (October 1813), and Kotor became his capital for a year. At the Congress of Vienna (1815), however, the land was returned to Austria. In Peter’s last years as ruler, he was involved in more wars with the Turks (1819 and 1821) and in settling blood feuds among his mountaineers; his efforts further enhanced his reputation as a just prince.
