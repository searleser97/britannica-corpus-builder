Alexander Stewart, duke of Albany, also called (1455–c. 1458) Earl Of March,  (born c. 1454—died  1485, France), second son of James II of Scotland, created duke of Albany in or before 1458. Both he and John, earl of Mar, quarrelled with their brother James III, who imprisoned them in 1479. Mar died, but Albany escaped to carry on a series of intrigues with the English, who supported his pretensions to the Scottish crown. Although he returned to favour and was lieutenant general of the realm during the winter of 1482–83, he was attainted in 1483 and defeated in another rising in 1484. Escaping to France, he died there the following year.
