Christian of Brunswick, byname Christian the Younger, German Christian der Jüngere,  (born Sept. 20, 1599, Gröningen, Bishopric of Halberstadt [Germany]—died June 16, 1626, Wolfenbüttel, Lower Saxony), duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Wolfenbüttel, Protestant military commander, and soldier of fortune during the early part of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), who made his reputation predominantly through his wholesale plundering and burning.
“The mad Halberstadter” (der tolle Halberstadter), or “the mad Christian,” as his contemporaries called him because of his unruly disposition, disliked his sedate position as administrator of the bishopric of Halberstadt, which he had assumed in 1616, and soon pursued the more exciting military life. After fighting under Maurice of Orange against the Spaniards in the Netherlands (1621), he raised an army for the Palatine elector Frederick V, and for five years he ranged across western Germany, eastern France, and the Netherlands, being twice defeated by the imperial marshal Johann Tserclaes, Count von Tilly. After renouncing his administrative role for the bishopric, Christian subsisted on the plunder he had taken and on French, Dutch, and English subsidies.
