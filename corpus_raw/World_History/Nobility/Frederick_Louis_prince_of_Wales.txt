Frederick Louis, prince of Wales, German Friedrich Ludwig,  (born Jan. 6, 1707, Hannover, Hanover—died  March 20, 1751, London), eldest son of King George II of Great Britain (reigned 1727–60) and father of King George III (reigned 1760–1820); his bitter quarrel with his father helped bring about the downfall of the King’s prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, in 1742.
After his grandfather became king of Great Britain as George I in 1714, Frederick was betrothed to Wilhelmina Sophia Dorothea, daughter of Frederick William I, king of Prussia, but the match was prevented by the ill will between the parents. On the accession of George II (1727) Frederick returned to England, was created duke of Cornwall, and in 1729 became prince of Wales.
The relations between father and son deteriorated rapidly, the chief bone of contention being the King’s refusal to make Frederick an adequate allowance. In 1735 the Prince wrote or inspired the Histoire du Prince Titi, which contained offensive caricatures of both the King and Queen. After Frederick married Augusta, daughter of Frederick II, duke of Saxe-Gotha, in April 1736, George II proposed to give his son an allowance of £50,000 a year, but this Frederick considered inadequate. The breach became irreparable when Frederick allowed his opposition friends to raise the matter, unsuccessfully, in Parliament (1737). He went to the length of refusing to allow his first child to be born under the parental roof, carrying off his wife, almost in labour, from Hampton Court.
After this insult, Frederick was banned from the court, and foreign ambassadors were told not to visit him. His new home, Leicester House, became a centre for political opposition. Frederick hated Sir Robert Walpole in particular; after Walpole’s downfall he was formally reconciled with his father but continued until his death to intrigue against all George’s ministers. In 1745 George refused to allow him to command the army against the Jacobites.
Frederick having died in 1751, his eldest son, George, succeeded to the throne as George III in 1760.
