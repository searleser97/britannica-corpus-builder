David ap Gruffudd,  (died October 1283, Shrewsbury, Salop [now Shropshire], England), the last native prince of Gwynedd in northern Wales; he initiated a major rebellion against the English in Wales, and upon his death Wales fell completely under English rule.
David’s grandfather, Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, had made Gwynedd the centre of Welsh power. After failing to prevent his brother, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, from becoming sole prince of Gwynedd in 1255, David continued to oppose him during his brother’s wars against the English kings Henry III (ruled 1216–72) and Edward I (ruled 1272–1307). In 1277 Edward I rewarded David with lands in northeast Wales. Nevertheless, David was so angered by the oppressive administration of English officials in adjoining territories that on March 22, 1282, he attacked the English garrison at Hawarden, Clwyd, thereby precipitating the final struggle for national independence. After Llywelyn was killed by English forces in December 1282, David became prince of Gwynedd. He continued to resist the English until June 1283, when he was betrayed and captured. He was drawn, hanged, and quartered in October. David was the last native Welsh prince to claim the title prince of Wales.
