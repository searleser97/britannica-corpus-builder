John III, byname John The Good,  French Jean Le Bon,  (born 1286—died  1341), duke of Brittany (from 1312), son of Arthur II. His death without heirs resulted in the War of the Breton Succession, pitting two indirect heirs, John of Montfort and Charles of Blois. Despite three marriages—to Isabella of Valois (d. 1309), Isabella of Castile (d. 1328), and Joan of Savoy (1334)—he was left childless and designated Charles of Blois his successor, to whom he espoused his niece (1338).
