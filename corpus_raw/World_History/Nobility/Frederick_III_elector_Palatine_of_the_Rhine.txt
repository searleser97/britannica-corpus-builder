Frederick III, byname Frederick the Pious, German Friedrich der Fromme,  (born Feb. 14, 1515, Simmern, Ger.—died  Oct. 26, 1576, Heidelberg, Rhenish Palatinate), elector Palatine of the Rhine (1559–76) and a leader of the German Protestant princes who worked for a Protestant victory in Germany, France, and the Netherlands.
Frederick adopted Lutheranism in 1546 and Calvinism somewhat later. His Calvinism and his opposition to the Habsburg emperors made his electoral position insecure, because the Peace of Augsburg (1555) covered relations only between Catholics and Lutherans, and the German Protestant princes were unwilling to venture an attack on the emperor. Frustrated in Germany, Frederick sent his sons to aid foreign Protestants, John Casimir to the French Huguenots and Christopher to Holland. By the time Frederick died, the Palatinate had become the centre of German Calvinism.
