Hermann I,   (born c. 1156—died  April 25, 1217, Gotha, Thuringia [Germany]), landgrave of Thuringia and count palatine of Saxony who helped defeat the Hohenstaufen emperor Henry VI’s attempt to transform the German kingdom from an elective into a hereditary monarchy.
Hermann received the Saxon palatinate about 1180 from his brother Louis III. On Louis III’s death (1190), the emperor Henry VI (who had wanted to seize Thuringia as a vacant fief) was forced by the German princes to grant it to Hermann. At the diet of Erfurt (October 1196) Hermann’s opposition was decisive in forcing Henry to abandon his plan of making the German monarchy hereditary.
In the conflict between the Welf (Guelf) Otto IV and his Hohenstaufen opponents following the death of Henry VI, Hermann influenced the course of events by frequently changing sides. In 1198, when the Hohenstaufen Philip of Swabia and Otto IV were rival pretenders to the German crown, Otto secured Hermann’s support by offering him more than Philip did. In 1204, however, Philip invaded Thuringia and compelled Hermann not only to change sides but also to surrender the acquisitions he had gained by siding with Otto in 1198. Hermann deserted the Hohenstaufen cause in 1208 but rejoined it in 1210, and in 1211 he was among the princes who invited Frederick of Hohenstaufen (later the emperor Frederick II) to come to Germany and assume the crown. When, as a result, Otto’s forces attacked Thuringia, Hermann was saved by Frederick II’s arrival in Germany in 1212.
