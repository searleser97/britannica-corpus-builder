Danilo II, in full Danilo Petrović Njegoš,  (born May 25, 1826, Njeguši, Montenegro—died August 13, 1860, Kotor), prince-bishop (1851–52) and then prince (1852–60) of Montenegro, who elevated Montenegro to a hereditary principality.
He became ruler of Montenegro upon the death of his uncle, Peter II Petrović Njegoš, the elective prince-bishop, and assumed the title of prince the following year (1852). He defeated the Turks near Ostrog in 1853 but refrained from attacking them during the Crimean War. His pacific policy produced much discontent among the warlike mountaineers, which culminated in an open revolt. His demand for the recognition of Montenegrin independence and other claims were set aside by the Congress of Paris. In 1858 his brother Mirko, “the Sword of Montenegro,” routed the Turks with great slaughter at Grahovo. Committed to the modernization of his country, Danilo II in 1855 promulgated a new code assuring civil and religious liberty to his subjects. He also reorganized the army and introduced the first modern system of taxation to Montenegro.
On August 11, 1860, he was shot at Persano on the Bocche de Cattaro by a Montenegrin whom he had exiled after the revolt, and he died two days afterward. He left no male offspring and was succeeded by Nicholas, the son of his brother Mirko.
