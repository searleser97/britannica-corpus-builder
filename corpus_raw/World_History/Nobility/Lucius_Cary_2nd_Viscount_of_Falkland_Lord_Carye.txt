Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount of Falkland, Cary also spelled Carey,  (born c. 1610, Burford Priory, Oxfordshire, England—died September 20, 1643, Newbury, Berkshire), English royalist who attempted to exercise a moderating influence in the struggles that preceded the English Civil Wars (1642–51) between the royalists and the Parliamentarians. He is remembered chiefly as a prominent figure in the History of the Rebellion by his close friend Edward Hyde (afterward Earl of Clarendon).
The son of Sir Henry Cary, lord deputy of Ireland from 1622 to 1629, Cary succeeded his father as Viscount Falkland in 1633. At his manor at Great Tew, near Burford Priory, Falkland surrounded himself with some of the most learned men of his age.
As a member of the Long Parliament, which convened in November 1640, Falkland at first took an active part in the opposition to the policies of King Charles I, going so far as to support the impeachment of the king’s chief minister, Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford. At the same time, he sought a compromise between the Anglican, or royalist, and the Puritan factions in Parliament. When the Puritans obtained control of the House of Commons, he broke with Parliament and on Jan. 1, 1642, became Charles I’s secretary of state. He saw limited action in the Civil Wars but fell into despair when it became evident the conflict would not end quickly. According to Hyde, Falkland then welcomed death on the battlefield. He was killed in the Battle of Newbury in September 1643.
