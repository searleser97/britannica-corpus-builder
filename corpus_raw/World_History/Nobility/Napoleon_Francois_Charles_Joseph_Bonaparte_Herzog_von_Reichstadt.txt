Napoléon-François-Charles-Joseph Bonaparte, duke von Reichstadt, also called king of Rome, orNapoleon II, byname L’Aiglon (French: “The Eaglet”),  (born March 20, 1811, Paris, France—died  July 22, 1832, Schönbrunn, Austria), only son of Emperor Napoleon I and Empress Marie-Louise; at birth he was styled king of Rome.
Three years after his birth, the French empire to which he was heir collapsed, and he was taken by the empress to Blois (April 1814). Upon Napoleon’s abdication in his son’s name as well as his own, Marie-Louise rejected appeals by his uncles Jérôme and Joseph Bonaparte to leave her son in France as figurehead for resistance (as Napoleon II) and took him to the court of her father, the Austrian emperor Francis I. Excluded from succession to his mother’s Italian dominions by the Treaty of Paris (1817), he received the Austrian title of duke of Reichstadt (1818). Allowed no active political role, he was instead used by Metternich, the Austrian statesman, in bargaining with France; and his name was also used by Bonapartist insurgents. In 1830, when Charles X of France was overthrown, Reichstadt was already ill with tuberculosis and was unable to take advantage of events.
