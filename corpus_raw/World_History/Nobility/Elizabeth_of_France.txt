Elizabeth Of France, French Élisabeth De France,  in full Élisabeth-philippine-marie-hélène, byname Madame Élisabeth,  (born May 3, 1764, Versailles, France—died  May 10, 1794, Paris), French princess, sister of King Louis XVI, noted for her courage and fidelity during the French Revolution, which sacrificed her to the guillotine.
She was the youngest daughter of the dauphin Louis (d. 1765) and Maria Josepha of Saxony. Whereas her aunt and two of her brothers (the future Louis XVIII and Charles X) emigrated, Madame Élisabeth refused to leave Louis XVI and queen consort Marie-Antoinette at grips with the Revolution. She was imprisoned with them in the Temple after the suspension of the monarchy on Aug. 10, 1792, and shared all the hardships that this involved. She was sentenced to death by the Revolutionary tribunal. The fortitude and patience with which she bore her trials won lasting respect, especially in Catholic and royalist circles.
The Mémoires de Madame Élisabeth, edited by F. de Barghon Fort-Rion (1858), are of doubtful authenticity, as are the Correspondance de Madame Élisabeth de France, edited by F. Feuillet de Conches (1868). The Life and Letters of Madame Élisabeth de France (1902) was translated by K.P. Wormeley.
