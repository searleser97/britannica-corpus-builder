Alessandro, in full Alessandro de’ Medici,  (born 1510/11, Florence [Italy]—died January 5–6, 1537, Florence), the first duke of Florence (1532–37).
Alessandro was born to unmarried parents. His paternity is ascribed either to Lorenzo de’ Medici (1492–1519), duke of Urbino, or, with more likelihood, to Giulio de’ Medici, nephew of Lorenzo the Magnificent. Giulio became a cardinal and in 1519 received the lordship of Florence, but, upon being elected pope (Clement VII) in 1523, he made Silvio Cardinal Passerini regent in Florence for Alessandro and another heir, Ippolito de’ Medici. Alessandro had meanwhile been created duke of Penna by the Holy Roman emperor Charles V (1522).
Republican sentiments and Savonarolan ideas were still strong in Florence, and Cardinal Passerini’s regency was unpopular. When imperial forces sacked Rome (May 1527), revolution broke out in Florence, and Passerini and the Medici fled. The Piagnoni family then came to power in Florence and restored the old regime of the republic. The indignation of the pope counted for little so long as he was at variance with Charles V, but in June 1529 pope and emperor came to terms. Charles agreed to restore the Medici in Florence and sent an army against the city, which capitulated after a siege of 11 months (October 1529–August 1530). Reprisals were taken against the opponents of the Medici. Alessandro, whom Charles had nominated head of state for Florence in October 1530, returned in June 1531. Ippolito had been created cardinal (January 1529).
The new Florentine constitution of April 1532 declared Alessandro to be hereditary duke and perpetual gonfalonier of the republic. Though his common sense and his feeling for justice won his subjects’ affection, Alessandro was rough and uncultured, a lover of sensual pleasures who enriched himself personally through taxes and duties and was determined to make his authority absolute beyond all question. After Clement VII’s death (1534) the exiled opposition sought to oust the duke from Florence and persuaded Ippolito to submit its case to Charles V. Ippolito, however, died suddenly at Itri (August 10, 1535), on his way from Rome to Tunis, where Charles then was, and Charles, returning from Tunis, received Alessandro at Naples and decided to uphold him. Married in 1536 to the emperor’s natural daughter Margaret, the duke now felt altogether secure, but in the night of January 5–6, 1537, his distant cousin Lorenzino, or Lorenzaccio, de’ Medici (1514–48), the companion and procurer of his licentious amusements, took advantage of his confidence in order to murder him. Disappointed at the Florentines’ failure to rise against tyrannical government, Lorenzino fled and was himself murdered in 1548.
