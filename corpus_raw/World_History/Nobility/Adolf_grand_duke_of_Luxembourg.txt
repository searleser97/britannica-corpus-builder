Adolf, also called Adolf, Duke (Herzog) von Nassau, in full Adolf Wilhelm August Karl Friedrich,  (born July 24, 1817, Biebrich, Nassau [Germany]—died Nov. 17, 1905, Hohenberg, Württemberg, Ger.), duke of Nassau from 1839 to 1867, who, as grand duke of Luxembourg from 1890 to 1905, was the first ruler of that autonomous duchy.
The son of Duke William of Nassau-Weilburg and Charlotte of Saxony, Adolf became duke of Nassau upon his father’s death (1839). Educated in Vienna and a military supporter of the Habsburgs, he sided with Austria against Prussia in the Seven Weeks’ War (over hegemony in German affairs); and, upon the defeat of Austria (1866), Nassau was annexed by Prussia. He formally abdicated as duke of Nassau (Sept. 9, 1867) and was granted 8,500,000 thalers and a few castles as compensation. He served as regent of Luxembourg for King William III of the Netherlands in 1889; when the male line of Orange-Nassau ended with William III’s death (1890) and the personal union between Luxembourg and the Netherlands ceased, the grand duchy reverted, according to the 1783 Nassau Succession Agreement, to him as the head of the ducal house of Nassau-Weilburg. Ruling until his death, he was succeeded by his son, Grand Duke William IV.
