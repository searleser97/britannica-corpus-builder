Philippe I, duke d’Orléans,  (born July 1, 1336—died  Sept. 1, 1375), the only member of the first dynasty of dukes of Orléans.
Philippe was the younger son of King Philip VI of France, who in 1344 established the peerage duchy for him to compensate for losing his expectation of Dauphiné, which had been reserved for him in 1343 but was subsequently assigned to his elder brother John (the future King John II). Philippe caused alarm by expanding his possessions but left no children by his wife, Charles IV’s daughter Blanche de France. On his death, therefore, the duchy was reunited to the French crown by Charles V.
