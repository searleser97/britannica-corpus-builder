Louis d’Armagnac, duc de Nemours, also called (until 1500) comte de Guise,  (born 1472—died April 28, 1503, Cerignola, Apulia, Kingdom of Naples), third son of Jacques d’Armagnac, duc de Nemours, and last of the ducal House of Armagnac.
The duchy of Nemours and all other honours forfeited by his father were restored to Louis’s elder brother, Jean d’Armagnac, by acts of 1484 and 1492. Louis inherited the duchy on the latter’s death in 1500. He had accompanied Charles VIII of France on his Italian campaigns and was named viceroy of Naples by Louis XII in 1501. In the ensuing wars between France and Spain over control of southern Italy, Nemours was killed at the Battle of Cerignola.
