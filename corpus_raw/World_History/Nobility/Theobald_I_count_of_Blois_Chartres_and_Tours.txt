Theobald I,  also called Theobald the Cheat, or Theobald the Old, French Thibaud le Tricheur, or Thibaud le Vieil,  (born c. 908—died c. 978), count of Blois, Chartres, and Tours.
Theobald earned his nickname “the Cheat” fighting with his neighbours, among them the kings of France, the dukes of Normandy, and the church of Reims. He seized the area around Blois about 940 and later augmented his holdings with the counties of Chartres and Châteaudun. In 945 Hugh the Great made Theobald responsible for holding the French king Louis IV prisoner.
