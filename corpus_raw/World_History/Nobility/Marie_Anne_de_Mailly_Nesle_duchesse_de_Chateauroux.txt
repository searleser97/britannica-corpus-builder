Marie-Anne de Mailly-Nesle, duchess de Châteauroux,   (born Oct. 5, 1717, Paris, France—died  Dec. 8, 1744, Paris), mistress of Louis XV of France who used her influence with the king to promote French involvement in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48).
The fifth daughter of Louis de Mailly, Marquis de Nesle, Marie-Anne was married in 1734 to the Marquis de La Tournelle, who died in 1740. Her eldest sister, Louise-Julie, Countess de Mailly, had been Louis XV’s mistress from 1737 to 1739, when she was replaced in the king’s affections by the second sister, Pauline-Félicité, Marquise de Vintimille. Mme de Vintimille died in 1741, and in December 1742 Louis took Mme de La Tournelle as his official mistress (maîtresse en titre). As her price for accepting the arrangement, she made Louis grant her the title Duchess de Châteauroux (1743) and dismiss her eldest sister from court. Mme de Châteauroux helped lead the court faction that brought France into the War of the Austrian Succession against Austria, and she persuaded Louis to take the field in pursuit of military glory. Louis allowed her to join him with the army in the Austrian Netherlands in June 1744, but, when he fell critically ill at Metz in August, he was persuaded by priests to send her away. After his unexpected recovery, however, Louis renewed their liaison. Mme de Châteauroux died suddenly of peritonitis several months later. Louis then evidently had brief affairs with the remaining two Nesle sisters.
