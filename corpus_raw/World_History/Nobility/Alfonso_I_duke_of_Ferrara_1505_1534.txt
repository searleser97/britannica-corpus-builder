Alfonso I,   (born July 21, 1476, Ferrara, Duchy of Ferrara—died  Oct. 31, 1534, Ferrara), duke of Ferrara from 1505, a noted Renaissance prince of the House of Este, an engineer and patron of the arts.
Alfonso succeeded to the duchy at the death of his father, Ercole I. He employed the poet Ludovico Ariosto and the painters Titian and Giovanni Bellini, and made Ferrara’s artillery the best in Italy. In the political sphere, Alfonso maintained Ferrara against the expanding power of the papacy by allying himself with France. Lucrezia Borgia, whom he married in 1501, bore him seven children.
