Thomas II de Beauchamp, 12th earl of Warwick,  (died July 8, 1401), one of the leaders in the resistance to England’s King Richard II.
He succeeded his father, Thomas I de Beauchamp, as earl in 1369. He served on the lords’ committee of reform in the Good Parliament in 1376 and again in 1377, and he was a member of the commission of inquiry in 1379. Appointed governor to Richard II in February 1381, Warwick joined the nobles who sought to impose their authority on the king and was one of the lords appellant in 1388.
After the overthrow of his party in 1389, Warwick lived in retirement, but, although he had for the moment escaped Richard’s vengeance, he was not forgiven. Being invited with both Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester, and Thomas Arundel to a banquet at court on July 10, 1397, he alone of the three was imprudent enough to obey the summons. He was immediately arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London, in that part of the fortress since known as the Beauchamp Tower. Warwick made a full confession in Parliament. His honours were forfeited and he himself banished. He was again in the Tower in 1398 but was liberated and restored to his honours on the accession of Henry IV.
