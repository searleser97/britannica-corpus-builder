James Hamilton, 2nd earl of Arran, in full James Hamilton, 2nd earl of Arran, duc de Châtelherault,  (born c. 1517—died  January 22, 1575, Hamilton, Lanarkshire, Scotland), earl of Arran who was heir presumptive to the throne after the accession of Mary Stuart in 1542 and was appointed her governor and tutor.
He negotiated for a marriage between Mary and Prince Edward (afterward Edward VI of England) but suddenly abandoned the project and joined the French party. He then agreed to the marriage of Mary with the dauphin of France, receiving the title of duc de Châtelherault at this time (1549), and he resigned office in 1554 in favour of the queen dowager, Mary of Lorraine. On the outbreak of the Scottish Reformation he joined the Lords of the Congregation (1559) and became the acknowledged leader of the Protestant party. He was exiled in 1565, but he returned to Scotland in 1569 to support the queen’s cause, not accepting the fact of Mary’s abdication and the regency for her son James VI until 1573.
