Sāsān,  (flourished 1st century ad?), eponymous ancestor of the Sāsānian dynasty in ancient Persia. Details of his life vary, but most scholars believe he was originally a prince in the province of Persis and a vassal of Gochihr, the chief petty king in Persis. His son or descendant was Bābak, who was the father of Ardashīr I, the founder of the Sāsānian Empire. According to one tradition, Sāsān married a daughter of Gochihr, and later their son Bābak revolted and killed Gochihr. According to another tradition, however, Sāsān and Bābak were not related, but Sāsān was a shepherd of King Bābak in Persis. After dreaming that Sāsān’s son would one day rule the world, Bābak gave Sāsān his daughter in marriage, and from this union Ardashīr was born.
