Ralph Neville, 1st earl of Westmorland,  Neville also spelled Nevill,  (born c. 1364—died  Oct. 21, 1425, Raby Castle, Durham, Eng.), English noble who, though created earl by King Richard II, supported the usurpation of the crown by Henry IV and did much to establish the Lancastrian dynasty.
The eldest son of John, 3rd Baron Neville, he was knighted during a French expedition in 1380, succeeded to his father’s barony in 1388, and was created Earl of Westmorland on Sept. 29, 1397. Further royal favours failed to command his allegiance, and in 1399 he joined his brother-in-law, Henry of Lancaster (later Henry IV), in securing the deposition of Richard II. As the new king’s kinsman (by his second marriage, to Joan Beaufort, half sister to Henry) and as a useful counterbalance to the strength of the Percy family in the North, Neville could expect suitable rewards. In September 1399 he was made marshal of England and in October was granted for life the valuable honour of Richmond, Yorkshire. In 1403 he helped suppress the Percy rebellion in the North, and in 1405 he intercepted rebel forces at Shipton Moor, near York, and tricked them into surrender: the rising in Yorkshire thus lost much strength.
Neville had now become very experienced in Scottish affairs, having long been a warden of the West March of Scotland, and was charged with the safekeeping of the northern border during Henry V’s absences in France. Hence, he took no part in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 (though Shakespeare thought he was present) or in later French campaigns but was a member of the Council of Regency under John, Duke of Bedford, in 1415.
