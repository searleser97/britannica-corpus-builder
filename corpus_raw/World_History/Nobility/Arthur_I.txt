Arthur I,  (born March 29, 1187, Nantes, Brittany—died  April 3, 1203?, Rouen or Cherbourg), duke of Brittany, a grandson of King Henry II of England; he was a rival of his uncle John (king of England from 1199) for several French provinces, both in his own interest and in that of King Philip II Augustus of France.
In October 1190 Arthur was recognized as heir presumptive to the English throne by another uncle, the childless King Richard I the Lion-Heart. Arthur was a posthumous child of Geoffrey, fourth of Henry II’s five sons, and his wardship was a point of contention between Richard and Philip. From 1196 he was reared in Philip’s household, causing Richard to disinherit the boy in favour of John, who, after Richard’s sudden death, was accepted as king in England and Normandy. Philip, however, recognized Arthur’s right to Brittany, Anjou, Aquitaine, and Maine and betrothed his daughter Mary to the young duke. The situation was complicated by Eleanor of Aquitaine, widow of Henry II, who wanted Aquitaine and Anjou for John. Captured in battle by John at Mirebeau-en-Poitou on Aug. 1, 1202, Arthur was imprisoned and, according to tradition, was murdered either by John himself or at his order.
