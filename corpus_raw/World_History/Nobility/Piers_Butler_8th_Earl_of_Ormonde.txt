Piers Butler, 8th earl of Ormonde, Piers also spelled Pierce, byname The Red Earl,  (born c. 1467—died August 21/26, 1539), leading member of the Butler family in Ireland; he claimed the earldom in 1515, seized the estates, and revived the Butler influence.
A cousin of the 7th earl (Thomas Butler), who died without issue, Piers Butler fought for the English against the rebel Irish lords and in 1522, styled as the pretended earl of Ormonde, he was made lord deputy of Ireland. In 1528, renouncing his claim to the earldom of Ormonde, he was made earl of Ossory, and Sir Thomas Boleyn was made earl of Ormonde. Then in 1538, Piers was given the earldom of Ormonde as a new creation. However, his son and successor, James (c. 1496–1546), 9th earl, was confirmed in the possession and precedence of the ancient earldom by Act of Parliament in 1544. James died, poisoned, at Ely House, London, on Oct. 28, 1546.
