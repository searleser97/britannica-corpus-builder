Raymond VI,  (born Oct. 27, 1156—died  August 1222, Toulouse, Fr.), count of Toulouse from 1194, who at first tolerated the heretical Cathari in Languedoc, then (1209) joined the Albigensian Crusade against them and afterward fought the crusaders to save his own dominions.
The son of Count Raymond V, Raymond VI was a nephew of King Louis VII of France and brother-in-law of King Richard I of England. Tolerant toward the many heretics among his subjects, Raymond VI was thought to have been an accessory to the murder of a papal legate, Peter of Castelnau, who had been urging him to act against the Cathari. After the Legate’s death (Jan. 15, 1208), Pope Innocent III proclaimed the crusade, which Raymond joined, perhaps as penance. The other crusaders, most of whom were North Frenchmen seeking lands in the South, were led by Simon de Montfort (father of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, famous in English history), and Raymond found himself obliged to defend his lands against their ambitions. In the Battle of Muret, near Toulouse (Sept. 12, 1213), Raymond and King Peter II of Aragon (his brother-in-law by a later marriage) were defeated by Simon, who was awarded Raymond’s countship by the fourth Lateran Council (1215).
With Aragonese help, however, Raymond reoccupied the city of Toulouse (September 1217). He then withstood a siege by Simon (who was killed near the city, June 25, 1218) and regained most of his lands before his sudden death. Twice excommunicated by the church, he was refused Christian burial.
