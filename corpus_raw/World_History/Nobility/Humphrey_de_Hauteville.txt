Humphrey De Hauteville, Italian Umfredo D’altavilla,  French Onfroi De Hauteville,  (born, Hauteville-la-Guichard, Normandy—died  1057, Melfi, Apulia), soldier of fortune who led the Norman conquest of southern Italy after the deaths of his older brothers William and Drogo and succeeded them as count of Apulia (1051).
Arriving in Italy c. 1035, Humphrey fought in Sicily and Apulia, in southern Italy, becoming count of Lavello in 1045. Six years later, as count of Apulia, he married the sister of the Lombard prince Gaimar V of Salerno. In 1052, after pro-Byzantine forces murdered Gaimar and seized Salerno, Humphrey helped Gaimar’s brother, the Duke of Sorrento, to recover the throne for Gaimar’s young son.
Humphrey also played an important role in the decisive Battle of Civitate (1053), in which the Normans defeated a papal army; Pope Leo IX was taken prisoner, and on his release and return to Rome in 1054, Humphrey escorted him as far as Capua, north of Naples.
Humphrey designated his half brother Robert Guiscard as successor and guardian of his infant son Abelard, but on Humphrey’s death Robert seized Abelard’s lands, thus becoming the greatest landholder in southern Italy and laying the foundation for his own power.
