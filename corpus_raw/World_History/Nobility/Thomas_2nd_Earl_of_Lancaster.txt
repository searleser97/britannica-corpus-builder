Thomas, 2nd earl of Lancaster,  (born c. 1278—died  March 22, 1322, Pontefract, Yorkshire, Eng.), a grandson of King Henry III of England and the main figure in the baronial opposition to King Edward II. His opposition to royal power derived more from personal ambition than from a desire for reform.
The son of Edmund (“Crouchback”), 1st Earl of Lancaster, he became involved in politics during the controversy over Edward II’s favourite, Piers Gaveston, and was among the earls who demanded Gaveston’s banishment in 1308 and who compelled Edward in 1310 to surrender his power to a committee of “Ordainers,” among whom he himself was numbered. After Gaveston returned to England in December 1311, Lancaster and other barons formed a confederacy to defend the Ordinances, and in the ensuing conflict it was on Lancaster’s territory that Gaveston was executed in 1312.
Pardoned by Edward II in 1313, Lancaster forced changes in the royal household in 1314 and by 1315 virtually controlled England. But his ambition became apparent, and a failure of statesmanship led to a fresh baronial grouping that by the compromise Treaty of Leake (1318) effected a formal reconciliation between him and the king. The rise of Hugh Le Despenser the Elder and Hugh Le Despenser the Younger as royal favourites by 1318 renewed Lancaster’s quarrel with Edward, who, after their banishment in 1321, took up arms on their behalf. Lancaster was defeated by the king’s forces at Boroughbridge and was executed near his castle of Pontefract, where his tomb became a centre of pilgrimage.
