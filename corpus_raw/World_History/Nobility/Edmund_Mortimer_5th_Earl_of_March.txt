Edmund Mortimer, 5th earl of March,  (born November 6, 1391, New Forest, Hampshire, England—died January 19, 1425, Ulster, Ireland), friend of the Lancastrian king Henry V and an unwilling royal claimant advanced by rebel barons.
Edmund was the great-grandson of Lionel, duke of Clarence, the second surviving son of Edward III, and was considered by some to be the heir presumptive of the childless Richard II.  His position became dangerous after Henry IV’s usurpation in 1399, for, by the ordinary rules of descent, he had a better title to the throne than the new king. Many people regarded him as the legitimate heir of Richard II, and it became the declared object of Owain Glyn Dŵr and the English rebels to make him king of England. In February 1405 a bold attempt was made to abduct him and his brother, Roger, from Windsor, but they were soon recaptured. For that reason Edmund was kept under close supervision throughout Henry IV’s reign, latterly by Henry, prince of Wales (the future Henry V). Edmund seems to have rewarded Henry V with persistent loyalty, and in August 1415 he revealed to the king a conspiracy formed by his own brother-in-law, Richard, earl of Cambridge, and by Henry, Lord Scrope of Masham, to put him on the throne in Henry’s place. He took part in the siege of Harfleur and thereafter served in all the French campaigns of Henry V’s reign. Appointed lieutenant in Ireland in 1423, Edmund died of the plague there.
With the death of this childless earl, the male line of the Mortimers became extinct. His lands, his titles, and his potential claim to the throne passed to his nephew Richard (died 1460), who became duke of York in 1426 and who, in 1460, laid claim to the English throne in virtue of his descent through the Mortimers from Lionel of Clarence; his son Edward became king of England in 1461.
