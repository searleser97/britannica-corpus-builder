Robert II, byname Robert The Jerusalemite,  French Robert Le Hierosolymitain, Dutch Robrecht Van Jeruzalem,  (born c. 1065—died  Oct. 5, 1111, near Meaux, Fr.), count of Flanders (1093–1111), one of the most celebrated of crusaders. The son of Robert I, he sailed for the Holy Land on the First Crusade in 1096 and earned fame perhaps second only to that of Godfrey of Bouillon. Returning to Flanders in 1100, he fought with his suzerain, Louis VI the Fat of France, against the English and was drowned in 1111 by the breaking of a bridge. He was succeeded by his son, Baldwin VII, who himself died fighting the English in 1119.
