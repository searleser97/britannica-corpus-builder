James Brydges, 1st duke of Chandos,  (born Jan. 6, 1673—died  Aug. 9, 1744), English nobleman, patron of composer George Frideric Handel.
The son and heir of James Brydges, 8th Baron Chandos of Sudeley, he was a member of Parliament from 1698 to 1714. For eight years (1705–13) during the War of the Spanish Succession, he was paymaster general of the forces abroad, whereby he amassed great wealth. Three days after his father’s death in 1714, he was created Viscount Wilton and Earl of Carnarvon, and in 1719 Marquess of Carnarvon and Duke of Chandos.
Chandos is chiefly remembered for his connections with Handel and with Alexander Pope. He built a magnificent house at Canons near Edgware in Middlesex; and for more than two years Handel, employed by Chandos, lived at Canons, where he composed his oratorio Esther. Pope, who in his Moral Essays (Epistle to the Earl of Burlington) doubtless described Canons under the guise of “Timon’s Villa,” referred to the duke in the line “Thus gracious Chandos is belov’d at sight.”
Chandos, who was lord lieutenant of the counties of Hereford and Radnor and chancellor of the University of St. Andrews, became involved in financial difficulties, and after his death Canons was pulled down for the sale of its materials.
He was succeeded by his son Henry, 2nd duke (1708–71), and grandson James, 3rd duke (1731–89). On the death of the latter without sons in September 1789, all of his titles, except that of Baron Kinloss, became extinct. The 3rd duke’s only daughter, Anna Elizabeth, who became Baroness Kinloss on her father’s death, was married in 1796 to Richard Grenville, afterward Marquess of Buckingham; and in 1822 this nobleman was created Duke of Buckingham and Chandos.
