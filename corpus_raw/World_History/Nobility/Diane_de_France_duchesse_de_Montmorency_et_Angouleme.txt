Diane De France,  (born 1538, Paris, France—died Jan. 11, 1619, Paris), natural daughter (legitimated) of King Henry II of France by a young Piedmontese, Filippa Duc. (Diane was often thought, however, to have been the illegitimate daughter of Diane de Poitiers.) She was known for her culture and intelligence as well as for her beauty and for the influence that she wielded during the reigns of Henry III and Henry IV.
Diane was legitimized in 1547. She married Orazio Farnese, duke di Castro, in 1553, but he was killed in battle the same year. In 1559 she married François de Montmorency, eldest son of Anne, constable of France. During Charles IX’s reign she helped to make her husband a leader of the Politiques, a moderate Roman Catholic group working for peace within the realm.
Widowed a second time in 1579, Diane enjoyed even greater influence with Henry III and in 1582 received the duchy of Angoulême in appanage (life estate). She did much to influence the king’s reconciliation with Henry of Navarre and was in great favour with the latter when he became king (as Henry IV). Further, she acted as mother to her niece Charlotte de Montmorency, later princess de Condé, with whom Henry IV fell in love. Diane’s letters have been saved, and they show her to have been a woman of great tolerance and courage.
