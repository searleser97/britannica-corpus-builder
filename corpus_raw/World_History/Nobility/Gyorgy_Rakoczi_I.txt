György Rákóczi, I,  (born June 8, 1593—died  Oct. 11, 1648, Sárospatak, Hung.), prince of Transylvania from 1630, who, as a champion of Protestantism, fought for and won religious freedom in Hungary and made his principality virtually an independent state.
György was the youngest son of Zsigmond Rákóczi, prince of Transylvania (1607–08). György took a leading part in the campaigns of Transylvania’s Prince Gábor Bethlen against the Habsburgs. After Bethlen’s death he was elected prince (Nov. 26, 1630) and continued Transylvania’s anti-Habsburg policy. In 1644, in alliance with Sweden, he declared war against the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand III and in the Peace of Linz (Dec. 16, 1645) won religious freedom for Protestants in Hungary and gained territory in western Hungary. Rákóczi’s capital Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia, Rom.) became a great Protestant centre.
