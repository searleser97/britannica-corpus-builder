Louis I,   (born Dec. 23, 1174, Kelheim, Bavaria—died  Sept. 15, 1231, Kelheim), second Wittelsbach duke of Bavaria, who greatly increased his family’s territory and influence.
Succeeding his father, Otto I, as duke in 1183, Louis enlarged the Bavarian domains and founded the cities of Landshut, Landau, Iser, and Straubing. In the struggle between Otto IV (of Brunswick) and Frederick of Hohenstaufen (Emperor Frederick II) for the throne of the Holy Roman Empire, he sided first with Otto, then switched to Frederick, who gave him control of the Rhenish Palatinate for his son (also named Otto) in 1214. He participated in the Fifth Crusade in Egypt (1221), and from 1225 to 1228 he was Frederick II’s regent in Germany. Louis rebelled against Frederick’s son Henry in 1228 and was murdered three years later, perhaps at the Emperor’s instigation.
