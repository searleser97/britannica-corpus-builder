Louis Bonaparte,  (born March 16, 1856, Paris—died  June 1, 1879, near Ulundi, Zululand), French prince imperial, the only son of Napoleon III by Empress Eugénie.
He was a delicate boy, but when the Franco-German War of 1870 broke out his mother sent him to the army. After the first defeats he had to flee from France with the Empress and settled in England at Chislehurst, completing his military education at Woolwich. On his father’s death (Jan. 9, 1873) the Bonapartists proclaimed him Napoleon IV, and he became the official pretender. The Bonapartist leaders thought that he should win his crown by military prestige, and he was persuaded to attach himself as a volunteer to the British expedition to Zululand in February 1879. While out on reconnaissance with a few troopers he was surprised by Zulus and killed at Ulundi. His body was brought back to England and buried at Chislehurst.
