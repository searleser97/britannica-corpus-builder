Charles II (or III), byname Charles The Great, French Charles Le Grand,  (born February 18, 1543, Nancy, Lorraine [Germany; now in France]—died May 14, 1608, Nancy), duke of Lorraine from 1545, whose reign is noted for its progress and prosperity.
Charles was the son of Francis I of Lorraine and Christina of Denmark. On his father’s death in 1545, his mother became regent for him, and in 1552 Charles was taken to Paris by Henry II of France after the French seizure of the bishoprics of Metz, Toul, and Verdun. In 1559 Charles married Henry’s daughter, Claude de France.
After the death of Henry’s successor, Francis II (1560), Charles returned to Nancy to rule his duchy. He maintained good relations with the Holy Roman Empire and extended his frontiers eastward by the acquisition of Bitche, Phalsbourg, and Marsal. In the French civil wars between Roman Catholics and Huguenots he long took no part, but in 1584 he adhered to the League (of French Catholics). He then tried to set up his eldest son Henry to dispute the right of the Protestant Henry of Navarre (the future Henry IV of France) to the French succession. Consequently, German Protestants ravaged Lorraine on their way into France (1587) to support Henry IV, and in 1592 Henry IV declared war. Henry’s conversion to Roman Catholicism, however, made Charles more conciliatory, and hostilities between them ended in 1594.
The reign of Charles III was the most brilliant in the history of Lorraine. He reformed the duchy’s judiciary and finances and encouraged economic development. He founded a university at Pont-à-Mousson in 1572, encouraged art, and enlarged Nancy as his capital.
