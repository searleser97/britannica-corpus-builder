John II,  (born 1239—died  1305, Lyon), duke of Brittany (from 1286) and count of Richemont, son of John I. He accompanied his father on St. Louis’s crusade to Tunisia (1270) and fought also in Palestine. He returned to Europe in 1272 and, in subsequent years, shifted repeatedly from one side to another in the wars between Edward I of England and Philip IV of France, who made him a peer of France (1297). His son, Arthur II, succeeded him.
