John Russell, 1st earl of Bedford,  (born c. 1485—died March 14, 1555, London, England), founder of the wealth and greatness of the house of Russell, who was a favourite of England’s Henry VIII and was created earl of Bedford during the reign of Edward VI.
He was with Henry VIII at the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520 and, returning to military service when the French war was renewed, lost his right eye at the siege of Morlaix in 1522. In 1523 he went secretly to France, where he negotiated a treaty between Henry and Charles, duke of Bourbon, who wished to betray the French king, Francis I. He visited Pope Clement VII in Rome in 1524 and, having eluded the French, who endeavoured to capture him, was present at the Battle of Pavia in February 1525, returning to England about the close of the year. From 1527 on, Russell’s life was mainly spent in England. He entered the Reformation Parliament for Buckingham in 1529 and, although an opponent of the party of Anne Boleyn, retained the favour of Henry VIII. He received many high honours and offices and became Baron Russell in 1539. When Charles V and Francis I were threatening to invade England in 1539, he was sent into the west and crossed to France when Henry attacked Francis in 1544. He was in command of an army in the west of England in 1545 and, when Henry died in January 1547, was one of the executors of his will.
Under Edward VI, Russell was lord high steward and keeper of the privy seal. He was created earl of Bedford in January 1550 and was one of the commissioners appointed to make peace with France in that year. He opposed the proposal to seat Lady Jane Grey on the throne; supported Mary I, who reappointed him lord privy seal (November 1553); and helped to prevent Sir Thomas Wyatt’s rebellion from spreading to Devonshire. He went to Spain to conclude the marriage treaty between Mary I and Philip II in 1554. He died in London, soon after his return.
