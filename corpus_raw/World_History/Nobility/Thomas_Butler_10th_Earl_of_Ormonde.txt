Thomas Butler, 10th earl of Ormonde, byname The Black Earl,  (born 1531/32—died  Nov. 22, 1614), Irish nobleman who sided with the English in the rebellions in the mid-16th century.
The son of the 9th earl (James Butler), he was brought up a Protestant at the English court after his father’s death in 1546. He returned to Ireland in 1554 and was appointed lord treasurer there in 1559. In the rebellions of the Irish he threw his great influence on the English side, but he was equally zealous in prosecuting his private feud with the Desmond family of Fitzgeralds. Gerald Fitzgerald, 14th earl of Desmond, finally rose in open revolt in December 1579, and Ormonde was appointed military governor of Munster in 1580 to put down the rebellion. He was able to pacify Munster after Desmond’s death in 1583. Appointed lieutenant governor in 1597, he suppressed the rebellion of the O’Neills and the Burkes. On his death he was succeeded by his nephew, Walter Butler (1569–1633), the 11th earl, who was in turn succeeded by a grandson, James Ormonde, the famous 1st duke of Ormonde.
