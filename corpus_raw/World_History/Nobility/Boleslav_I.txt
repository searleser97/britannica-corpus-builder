Boleslav I, byname Boleslav the Cruel, Czech Boleslav Krutý,  (died July 15, 967), Přemyslid prince of Bohemia from 929, who established the basis of the medieval Czech state.
After instigating the murder of his elder brother, Prince Wenceslas I (St. Wenceslas), Boleslav became ruler of Bohemia. He made Prague the effective administrative centre of his domain, promoted the spread of Christianity, and added the territories of Moravia, Slovakia, and Silesia to his domain. After being attacked by the Holy Roman emperor Otto I (950), he was forced to recognize the German king as his suzerain. His feudal ties remained largely formal, however, and Bohemia was able to retain its autonomy. Several years later, Boleslav cooperated with Otto in combating the invasion of the Magyars and directed a Bohemian contingent against them at the Battle of Lechfeld (955).
