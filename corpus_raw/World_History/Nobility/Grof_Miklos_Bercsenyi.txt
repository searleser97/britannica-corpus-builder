Gróf Miklós Bercsényi,  (born September 1665, Temetvény, Hung. [now Hrádok, Slovakia]—died Nov. 6, 1725, Tekirdağ, Turkey), chief general in the Kuruc (anti-Habsburg) insurrection (1703–11) in Hungary and deputy to its leader, Prince Ferenc Rákóczi II of Transylvania.
Born to an old and prestigious noble family, Bercsényi studied at the University of Nagyszombat and then became a member of the court of the palatine, the most powerful official in the Hungarian kingdom. In 1686 he fought with distinction in the siege of Buda, which marked the end of Turkish rule in Hungary, and was promoted to colonel. Later he was given command of the border fortresses around Szeged. In 1687 he was made a count and appointed the king’s chamberlain and counsel.
In 1696 Bercsényi met Rákóczi and from then on was his military partner and most loyal friend. When Rákóczi was arrested for rebelling against Leopold, the Habsburg king, Bercsényi fled to Poland and prepared the uprising against the Habsburgs. In 1703 he returned with Polish troops to support the struggle for independence. He was put in charge of the uprising’s military operations and was made Rákóczi’s deputy in 1707. Bercsényi also negotiated an alliance with Russian Tsar Peter I in Warsaw, though too late to prevent the crushing of the uprising. At the invitation of the Ottoman sultan, Bercsényi joined the army of the Turkish grand vizier in 1717, but the troops attacking Hungarian territory at Orsova (on the lower Danube) were beaten back by the imperial army. He then shared Rákóczi’s exile in Tekirdağ, Turkey, where he died in 1725. His ashes were brought back to Hungary with those of Rákóczi and placed in the cathedral in Kassa (now Košice, Slovakia).
