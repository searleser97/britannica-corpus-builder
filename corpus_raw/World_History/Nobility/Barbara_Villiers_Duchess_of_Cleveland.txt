Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland, married name (1659–70) Barbara Palmer, or (from 1661) Countess of Castlemaine,  (born autumn 1641, London, England—died October 9, 1709, Chiswick, Middlesex), a favourite mistress of the English king Charles II; she bore several of his illegitimate children. According to the diarist Samuel Pepys, she was a woman of exceptional beauty, but others commented on her crude mannerisms.
She was the daughter of William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison (d. 1643). Her intimacy with Charles II began soon after her marriage in 1659 to Roger Palmer, who was created Earl of Castlemaine two years later. The king probably fathered her first child, Anne, born in February 1661, although paternity was also attributed to one of her earlier lovers, the 2nd Earl of Chesterfield. Legend has it that the restored king spent his first night at his palace in Whitehall with her. In the early years after the Restoration, her house became the rendezvous for opponents of Lord Chancellor Clarendon, and her delight at his fall in 1667 was conspicuous. But although her favour had become an avenue to political advancement (her most famous protégé was Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington, for a time one of the most powerful advisers of Charles II), her hold on the king was precarious. He had forced the queen to accept her as one of the ladies of the bedchamber in 1662, a status she retained for several years. She had become a Roman Catholic in 1663, and for a while the French ambassador was instructed to seek her favour. But the king paid less attention to her demands after 1670, and by 1674 she was entirely supplanted by Louise de Kéroualle, Duchess of Portsmouth.
In 1670 Barbara Villiers became Countess of Southampton and Duchess of Cleveland. She secured the right of succession to the remainder titles for her first and third sons, Charles and George, but the king at this time did not admit paternity of her second son, Henry. She consoled herself with other lovers, such as John Churchill, later 1st Duke of Marlborough (who probably fathered her daughter Barbara), and the playwright William Wycherley. In 1677 she settled in Paris.
She returned to England just before Charles died in February 1685. In July 1705 her husband, the Earl of Castlemaine, whom she had left in 1662, died, and the same year, the duchess was married to the notorious rake Robert “Beau” Fielding (d. 1712), but this union was declared void in 1707.
