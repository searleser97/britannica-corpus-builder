Anacharsis,  (flourished early 6th century bc?), legendary Scythian prince included in some ancient Greek lists as one of the Seven Wise Men and extolled as an exemplar of primitive virtue.
Herodotus describes how, after extensive travels abroad in quest of knowledge or as an ambassador, Anacharsis returned home and was killed by the Scythians, either because he wanted to introduce the cult of the Great Mother (Magna Mater) of the Gods or because of his attachment to Greek customs. Later authors, offering more details, credit Anacharsis with numerous aphorisms and cite an interview between him and Solon. The Cynic philosophers represented Anacharsis as a “noble savage,” to be contrasted with the “degenerate” civilized Greeks. Ten letters anciently ascribed to Anacharsis are spurious.
