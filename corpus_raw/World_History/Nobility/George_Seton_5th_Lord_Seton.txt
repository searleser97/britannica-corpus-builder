George Seton, 5th Lord Seton,  (born 1531—died  Jan. 8, 1586), one of the most loyal supporters and friends of Mary, Queen of Scots.
He was the eldest son of the 4th Lord Seton (d. 1549) and was educated in France. He was present at Mary’s marriage with the dauphin (afterward Francis II of France) in 1557, and three years later he was again in France because of his adherence to Roman Catholicism. When Mary returned to Scotland (1561), he became privy councillor and master of the household, but four years later he again found it advisable to retire to France. Mary and Lord Darnley spent their honeymoon at Seton Palace, and Mary found a retreat there after the murder of David Riccio and again after the murder of Darnley. After Mary’s escape from Lochleven in May 1568, Lord Seton took her to his castle at Niddrie, Linlithgowshire, and thence to Hamilton. A week later he was taken prisoner at Langside. He was set free after the assassination of the regent, the 1st earl of Moray, and made his way to Flanders, where he was said to have made his living as a wagoner. He was, in fact, entrusted by Mary’s supporters with a mission to the duke of Alva and sought in vain to secure for service in Scotland two regiments of Scots then in Spanish pay.
He returned home in 1571, being apparently reconciled with the government, but he retained his Roman Catholicism and his friendship for Mary, who wrote to Elizabeth I in 1581 desiring a passport for Lord Seton that he might alleviate her solitude. In 1581 he was one of the judges in the trial of the accused murderer of Darnley, the 4th earl of Morton, and in 1583 he was sent as ambassador to France, where he sought interference on Queen Mary’s behalf. He died soon after his return in 1585.
