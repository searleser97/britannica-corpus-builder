Břetislav I, byname Břetislav the Restorer, Czech Břetislav Obnovitel,  (born 1005?—died Jan. 10, 1055), prince of Bohemia from 1034 to 1055, who permanently attached the province of Moravia to Bohemia.
Břetislav succeeded his father, Oldřich, to the Bohemian throne after a period of dynastic struggles. He proceeded to win back lands that earlier had been lost to Poland, regaining in two great campaigns not only all of Moravia but also Silesia and Kraków. He also captured Poznań and Gniezno, but his ambitions for a greater West Slav nation troubled the Holy Roman emperor Henry III, who mounted an armed invasion and compelled Břetislav to evacuate all of Poland except Silesia (which nevertheless was returned to Poland some years later). Břetislav’s efforts to regain Slovakia from Hungary were unsuccessful (it did not return to Czech control until 1918).
To obviate the incessant struggles that had endangered Bohemia at every vacancy of the throne, Břetislav, with the consent of the nobles, decreed that the oldest member of the house of Přemysl should be the ruler of Bohemia. Břetislav was therefore succeeded first by his eldest son, Spytihněv II (1031–61), and then by his second son, Vratislav II (c. 1035–92).
