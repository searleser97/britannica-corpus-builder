René I, byname René Of Anjou,  French René D’anjou,  (born Jan. 16, 1409, Angers, Fr.—died  July 10, 1480, Aix-en-Provence), duke of Bar (from 1434), duke of Anjou (from 1430), and count of Provence and of Piedmont. He was also titular king of Naples from 1435 to 1442 and duke consort of Lorraine from 1431 to 1453. He was the second son of Louis II, duke d’Anjou, and Yolanda of Aragon.
On his father’s death (1417), René’s elder brother, Louis III, succeeded to Anjou, Maine, and Provence; but in 1419 his maternal granduncle, Duke Louis of Bar, named René as his successor. In 1420, moreover, René married Isabella, elder daughter of Charles II of Lorraine. Sole ruler of Bar from 1430, he claimed Lorraine by right of his wife on Charles II’s death (1431). King Charles VII of France supported this claim, but Antony of Vaudémont contested it.
Antony defeated René at Bulgnéville (July 2, 1431), took him prisoner, and handed him over to Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. Released on parole (May 1432) after giving his sons John and Louis as hostages, René in 1433 agreed that his elder daughter Yolande (1428–83) should marry Antony’s son Ferry; but in 1434, when the Holy Roman emperor Sigismund had recognized René as duke of Lorraine (April) and when René had also inherited Anjou and Provence from Louis III (November), Philip took umbrage and, in December, summoned René back into captivity. René finally obtained his discharge in 1437, promising a heavy ransom and making territorial concessions.
Meanwhile Joan II of Naples, who died in February 1435, had made René her heir. After further conciliating Burgundy by the marriage of his son John to Philip’s niece, René in spring 1438 sailed for Naples, which his wife Isabella had been defending against his rival Alfonso V of Aragon. Besieged in Naples by Alfonso from November 1441, he abandoned the city in June 1442. In October he was back in Provence.
From the 1420s the English had been occupying Maine. To recover it for his younger brother Charles, René took part in the Anglo-French negotiations begun at Tours in April 1444. These led to the marriage of his younger daughter Margaret to the English king Henry VI in 1445, but Maine had eventually to be won back by force of arms (1448). Meanwhile Charles VII of France had helped René to pacify Lorraine, and the long-planned marriage of Yolande and Ferry had been solemnized (summer 1445). René accompanied Charles VII on his victorious campaigns of 1449–50 against the English in Normandy. On Isabella’s death (1453), her duchy of Lorraine passed to René’s son John.
Thereafter, apart from important measures for the economic development of Provence, which also benefited from legal reforms under him, René concerned himself more with the arts and literature in Anjou and Provence than with dynastic ambitions. In 1466, however, he accepted the title of king of Aragon and count of Barcelona from the Catalan rebels against John II of Aragon—but without result. With Louis XI of France his relations were generally strained, and Louis forced him to yield Anjou to the French crown.
René has been credited with numerous paintings, often simply because they bear his arms. These works, generally in the Flemish style, were probably executed at his behest by the painters maintained at his court, together with sculptors, goldsmiths, and tapestry workers. His writings, or works inspired by him (collected edition, 1843–46), include a treatise on tournaments, an idyllic poem on his courtship of Jeanne de Laval, a mystical dialogue, and an allegorical romance.
