John Spencer Bassett,  (born Sept. 10, 1867, Tarboro, N.C., American—died  Jan. 27, 1928, Washington, D.C.), American historian and founder of the South Atlantic Quarterly, influential in the development of historiography in the American South.
A graduate of Trinity College (now Duke University), Durham, N.C., in 1888, he received a doctorate in 1894 from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and taught history at Trinity College (1893–1906) and at Smith College, Northampton, Mass. (1906 until his death). During his tenure at Trinity he was actively engaged in collecting historical works on the South and by 1902 had launched the South Atlantic Quarterly, a literary periodical for scholars. Under his editorship, the Quarterly became one of the more liberal periodicals in the South; his own articles deplored racial injustice and provincial isolation.
In 1906 he organized the Smith College Studies in History, and in 1919 he was elected secretary of the American Historical Association. A prolific writer, he produced, among other works, The Federalist System (1906), The Life of Andrew Jackson, 2 vol. (1911), Short History of the United States (1913), The Middle Group of American Historians (1917), and Makers of a New Nation (1928).
