Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shropshire or Shrewsbury,  Bellême also spelled Belesme,  (born c. 1052—died  after 1130, Wareham, Dorset, Eng.), Norman magnate, soldier, and outstanding military architect, who for a time was the most powerful vassal of the English crown under the second and third Norman kings, William II Rufus (died 1100) and Henry I. His contemporary reputation for sadism was extreme, even among the cruel Normans.
A younger son of Roger de Montgomery, 1st earl of Shropshire or Shrewsbury, Robert inherited lordships in Normandy, among them Bellême (in the present French département of Orne). In the struggle between the two older sons of King William I the Conqueror he originally sided with Duke Robert II Curthose of Normandy, but in 1097 he fought for the other son, William II Rufus, against the Duke and King Philip I of France. Also on behalf of Rufus, he captured Helias (Hélie), count of Maine, thereby securing the important town of Le Mans for the English. His greatest work of military architecture was the castle of Gisors, on the border between Normandy and the French kingdom.
After Henry I, who had been Robert’s chief rival for power in Normandy, had succeeded Henry’s older brother, Rufus, as king of England, Robert rebelled (1101–02). He was deprived of his English lands and earldom (1102) and unsuccessfully fought against Henry in the Battle of Tinchebrai (Sept. 28, 1106). King Louis VI of France sent him (November 1112) as ambassador to Henry I, who quickly arrested Robert and imprisoned him for the rest of his life.
