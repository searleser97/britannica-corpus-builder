Paul Bronsart von Schellendorf,  (born Jan. 25, 1832, Danzig, Prussia [now Gdańsk, Pol.]—died  June 23, 1891, near Braunsberg, Prussia [Germany]), soldier, military writer, and minister of war who helped reform the Prussian army of the 1880s.
Entering the army in 1849, Bronsart became a protégé of the Prussian chief of the general staff, Helmuth von Moltke, held high staff appointments during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), and conducted the preliminary negotiations for the French surrender at Sedan. A royalist officer firmly convinced that parliament should not interfere in military matters, he served as minister of war from 1883 to 1889 and worked for the modernization of the army and the replacement of the single-shot rifle with a magazine weapon. His most important work, Der Dienst des Generalstabes im Frieden und im Kriege (1875), was officially issued to the British army as The Duties of the General Staff (1905).
