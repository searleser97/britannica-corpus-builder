Guglielmo Pepe,  (born Feb. 13, 1783, Squillace, Calabria, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies [now in Italy]—died  Aug. 8, 1855, Turin, Piedmont), Neapolitan soldier prominent in the Italian Risorgimento and author of valuable eyewitness accounts.
After briefly attending a military academy, Pepe enlisted at 16 in the republican army formed in Naples as a result of the French Revolution. He was wounded and taken prisoner by the royalists, but his life was spared because of his youth. In 1800 he fought under Napoleon at Marengo and continued in French service for several years, commanding a brigade in Spain in 1811–13. After the Bourbon restoration in Naples, Pepe accepted a commission in the royal army and helped suppress brigands in Calabria; but, when revolution broke out in 1820, he took command of the republican army. Failure of the revolution sent him into exile, mainly in England, where he spent the next several years writing of his experiences, including A Narrative of the Political and Military Events Which Took Place at Naples in 1820 and 1821 (1821). His memoirs appeared in 1846, but in 1848, following the major revolution of that year, he was once more back in Naples. Sent north to aid in the war against Austria, he was recalled to Naples but instead joined in the defense of Venice. After the city’s surrender he went to Paris; but, after Louis-Napoléon’s coup d’état (1851), Pepe moved to Turin. His Casi d’Italia negli anni 1847, 1848, 1849 (Narrative of Scenes and Events in Italy, from 1847 to 1849) was published in 1850.
