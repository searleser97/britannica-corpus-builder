Zhu Shunshui, Wade-Giles romanization Chu Shun-shui, original name Zhu Zhiyu, literary name Shunshui,  (born November 1600, Yuyao, Zhejiang province, China—died April 1682, Mito fief, Hitachi province [now Ibaraki prefecture], Japan), Chinese scholar and patriot who fled China after the destruction of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Arriving in Japan, he became one of the primary compilers of the Dai Nihon shi (“History of Great Japan”), a comprehensive rewriting of Japanese history, which served to reawaken nationalistic feelings as well as to develop a sense of loyalty to the emperor.
Zhu was originally an official of the Ming dynasty, which was overthrown by the Manchu forces who established the Qing dynasty (1644–1911/12). Zhu not only refused to serve the new rulers, he also attempted to raise an army against them. His efforts to enlist Japanese support for his cause were fruitless, and in 1659 he decided to settle in Nagasaki. There Tokugawa Mitsukuni, a member of the shogun’s family and a great feudal lord in his own right, invited Zhu to aid him in the historical project he had begun. Zhu agreed in 1665, resettling in Mitsukuni’s Mito fief, where he helped structure the Dai Nihon shi. Although the project was not actually completed until two centuries after Zhu’s death, his influence was decisive in establishing the general outlines of the work as well as in making its paramount theme that of patriotism and loyalty to the throne. Zhu’s unswerving loyalty to the Ming dynasty provided a model for Chinese students in Japan who, late in the 19th century, returned home to lead the struggle that overthrew the Qing dynasty in the Chinese Revolution of 1911.
