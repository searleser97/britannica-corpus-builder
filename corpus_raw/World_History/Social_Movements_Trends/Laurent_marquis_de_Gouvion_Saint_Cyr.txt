Laurent, marquis de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr,   (born April 13, 1764, Toul, Fr.—died  March 17, 1830, Hyères), French soldier and statesman who distinguished himself in the Napoleonic Wars (1800–15). As minister of war in 1817–19 he was responsible for reorganizing recruitment procedures in the French army.
An artist as a young man, Gouvion in 1792 enthusiastically joined the French Revolutionary armies. His heroic performance in Germany at the battles of Mainz and Mannheim (1795) won him promotion to the rank of general, and he subsequently served in Egypt and Italy. In 1801 Napoleon Bonaparte appointed him ambassador to Spain, where he played an important role in Napoleon’s extended but inconclusive campaign in the Iberian Peninsula. Gouvion participated in the Russian campaign (1812), and his victory at the Battle of Polotsk gained him a marshal’s baton. In 1813 he commanded an unsuccessful defense of Dresden and then voluntarily withdrew from military and political affairs for almost two years.
In 1815 and then again in 1817 King Louis XVIII appointed Gouvion minister of war. Although his past service to the republic and the empire undermined his credibility with the reactionary-royalist “ultra” party, Gouvion proceeded with a substantial reform program that included a recall to service of former Napoleonic officers, inducements for enlistment, a rationalization of promotion procedures, and the introduction of a lottery to fill quotas. Forced into retirement when the liberal ministry fell to “ultra” pressures, Gouvion wrote several historical works, notably Mémoires sur les campagnes des armées du Rhin et de Rhin-et-Moselle . . . (1829; “Memoirs of the Campaigns of the Armies of the Rhine and of Rhine-et-Moselle”).
