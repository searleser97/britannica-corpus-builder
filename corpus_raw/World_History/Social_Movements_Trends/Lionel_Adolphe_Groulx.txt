Lionel-Adolphe Groulx,  (born Jan. 13, 1878, Chenaux, near Vaudreuil, Que., Can.—died  May 23, 1967, Vaudreuil), Canadian priest and historian who for 50 years strongly influenced the Quebec nationalist movement.
The son of a lumberjack, Groulx became a seminarian at Sainte-Thérèse-de-Blaineville and Montreal and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1903. After teaching at a seminary in Valleyfield, Que., he studied abroad, earning a Ph.D. at the University of Rome in 1907 and a doctorate in theology in 1908. He taught again at Valleyfield until 1915, when he was appointed professor of Canadian history at the University of Montreal.
His early writings celebrated the faith and virtues of earlier days. Although his historical training was informal, his interpretation of French-Canadian history as a struggle for survival against the continuing dominance of British Canada had wide and prolonged influence. He published two novels (1922 and 1932) under the pseudonym Alonie de Lestres. His most important work was the four-volume Histoire du Canada français depuis la découverte (1950–52; “History of French Canada Since Its Discovery”). Other influential writings were the five-volume Nos Luttes constitutionnelles (1915–16; “Our Constitutional Struggles”) and La Confédération canadienne, ses origines (1918; “The Canadian Confederation, Its Origins”).
Groulx early founded an organization that grew into Catholic Action (L’Action Catholique) and later (1946) the Institute of History of French America. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, from which he resigned in 1952, just before his retirement from his chair of history. Not a separatist per se, Groulx nevertheless was a jealous conservator of the distinctive history and traditions of French Canada. He considered efforts to teach the same “objective” history to French- and English-Canadians as a “campaign to denaturalize French-Canadians.”
