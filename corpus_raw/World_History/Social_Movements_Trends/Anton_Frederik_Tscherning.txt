Anton Frederik Tscherning,  (born Dec. 12, 1795, Frederiksværk, Den.—died  June 29, 1874, Copenhagen), military reformer and radical champion of democracy in mid-19th-century Denmark.
While still an artillery officer in the Danish army, Tscherning developed a hatred for his country’s absolutist regime. Leaving the military in the early 1840s, he became a founder in 1846 of the Society of Friends of the Peasant, a political reform organization of urban and agrarian intellectuals; he served as its chairman from 1846 to 1856. Following the liberal nationalist demonstrations of March 1848 that forced the king to call for a limited constitutional monarchy, Tscherning was named war minister in the new government. Reflecting popular demand, it immediately engaged Denmark in the Schleswig War (1848–50) for the annexation of the duchy of Schleswig. Serving as war minister until November 1848, Tscherning successfully reorganized the army, though he was less fortunate in directing field operations. He sat in Parliament from 1849 to 1866 and in the State Council from 1854 to 1864, at all times urging greater democratic participation, agrarian reform, free trade, and reduction of civil-service expenditure.
In the early 1860s Tscherning spoke out against the National Liberal government’s chauvinistic policy of incorporating Schleswig into the state, breaking with most of the peasant party on that issue. After the disastrous Danish-German War (1864), he again led the democratic forces in unsuccessful agitation against the restrictive 1866 reform of membership in the upper chamber of Parliament.
