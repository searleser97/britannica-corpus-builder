Board of Education v. Allen, in full Board of Education of Central School District No. 1 v. Allen,  case in which the U.S. Supreme Court on June 10, 1968, ruled (6–3) that a New York state statute that required public school authorities to lend textbooks to private schools, including those with religious affiliations, did not violate the establishment or free-exercise clauses of the First Amendment.
The New York law in question ordered public school officials to lend textbooks, without charge, to all students in grades 7 through 12, including those in parochial schools. The Board of Education of Central School District No. 1 and other school boards subsequently filed suit; James Allen, the state commissioner of education, was named as a respondent. The school boards sought to have the law declared unconstitutional, to bar the commissioner from firing those who refused to comply with the law, and to stop state funds from being used to purchase textbooks that would be lent to students in religious schools.
A trial court found the statute unconstitutional, but an appellate court held that the school boards had no standing to question the validity of the statute and thus reversed the lower court’s decision. The case then moved to the New York Court of Appeals. That court ruled that the school boards did have standing, but it found that the statute was constitutional.
The case was argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on April 22, 1968. The court first addressed the establishment clause, which generally prohibits the government from establishing, advancing, or giving favour to any religion. The justices held that the primary purpose of the statute was the improvement of education for all children. The books in question were not religious, and the law itself did not promote any religion. Moreover, the court held that because the books were given to the children, the private schools did not receive any financial benefits. The Supreme Court thus found that the statute served a secular purpose and did not violate the establishment clause. It further ruled that the school boards had presented no evidence that the law “coerces them in any way in the practice of religion,” and thereby it dismissed the free-exercise claims. The decision of the New York Court of Appeals was upheld.
Several years later, in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), the Supreme Court clarified the constitutionality of state acts pertaining to the establishment of religion by devising a test.
