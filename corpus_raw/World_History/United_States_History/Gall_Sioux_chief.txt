Gall,   (born c. 1840, near Moreau River [in present-day South Dakota], U.S.â€”died  1894, near Oak Creek, S.D.), Hunkpapa Sioux war chief, who was one of the most important military leaders at the Battle of the Little Bighorn (June 25, 1876).
Orphaned at an early age, Gall was adopted as a younger brother by the Sioux chief Sitting Bull. In many clashes with settlers and the U.S. Army, Gall distinguished himself as an excellent tactician and strategist. At the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Gall is credited with having turned back an initial Indian rout and then luring Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer and his men into an indefensible position, annihilating his force. After this victory, Gall and Sitting Bull faced continual skirmishes and battles with the military, and in May 1877 he followed Sitting Bull into Canada. The Canadian government would not give them a reservation, the herds of buffalo were gone, and Gall and his people faced starvation. He eventually abandoned Sitting Bull and surrendered to the U.S. Army (c. 1880). Once on the Sioux reservation in South Dakota, Gall urged his people to become more acculturated with the whites. His breach with Sitting Bull (who eventually lived on the reservation) became complete when Gall was persuaded to sign the treaty of 1889 that broke up the so-called Great Sioux Reservation and ceded much territory to white settlers.
