Jean-Baptiste-Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau,  (born July 1, 1725, Vendôme, Fr.—died May 10, 1807, Thoré), general who supported the American Revolution by commanding French forces that helped defeat the British at Yorktown, Va. (1781).
Rochambeau was originally trained for the church but then entered a cavalry regiment. He fought in the War of the Austrian Succession, attaining the rank of colonel. He became a brigadier general and inspector of cavalry in 1761 and in 1776 was appointed governor of Villefranche-en-Roussillon. Four years later he was put in command of a French army of about 6,000 troops destined for North America to join the Continentals in their struggle for independence from the British.
Rochambeau and his troops arrived in Newport, R.I., in July 1780 and waited nearly a year for the arrival of French naval support (which never came). Finally, in June 1781 he joined forces with General George Washington in White Plains, N.Y., and together they made a swift descent to Yorktown, where Franco-American forces under the Marquis de Lafayette were harassing the British. With the aid of French naval forces under Admiral de Grasse, the allies laid siege to Lord Cornwallis’ forces, bottled them up on the peninsula, and forced Cornwallis to surrender on October 19, thus virtually ending the war.
Rochambeau remained in Virginia for another year and then embarked for Europe in January 1783. Acknowledging his distinctive contribution to the peace, King Louis XVI appointed him commander of Calais and later of the Alsace district. During the French Revolution he commanded the Army of the North (1790–91) and was created a marshal of France (1791). Arrested during the Reign of Terror, he narrowly escaped the guillotine; but Napoleon then pensioned him.
