Georgia Platform,   statement of qualified support for the U.S. Union among Georgia conservatives following the Compromise of 1850.
Drawn up by Charles J. Jenkins and adopted by a state convention on Dec. 10, 1850, at Milledgeville, the Georgia Platform consisted of a set of resolutions accepting the Compromise of 1850. It was not an endorsement of the compromise, but it said that Georgia would abide by the compromise provisions “as a permanent adjustment of the sectional controversy.”
The Georgia Platform warned that the state would and should resist any future congressional activity disrupting the interstate slave trade, weakening the fugitive slave laws, or abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia. Such activity could well prompt a dissolution of the Union, according to the Georgia Platform.
