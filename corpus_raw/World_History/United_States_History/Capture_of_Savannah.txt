Capture of Savannah,  (29 December 1778), engagement in the American Revolution.  Stalemate in their war with the Americans in the north and concern over French attacks against British-held Caribbean islands caused the British to focus on securing American colonies in the south. A primary objective was the capture of the port of Savannah, in Georgia. A force of British regulars was sent to bolster that operation.
Lieutenant General Henry Clinton envisaged a combined British effort with troops coming from East Florida, but the small Florida force was easily repulsed by the American outposts before British ships arrived with 3,500 men under Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell. These sailed up the Savannah River and landed Campbell with his men 3 miles (5 km) east of Savannah on 29 December. He then worked his way overland toward the town.
The mixed American defense force of Continentals and militia under Major General Robert Howe could muster only 850 effective men. Howe positioned his men around the southern edge of Savannah with the untrained local militia on his far right, farthest from the point of expected British arrival. He then waited, thinking the surrounding swamps would disrupt Campbell’s advance.
However, a local slave showed Campbell a hidden path around to the American right flank. Campbell sent an assault force in that direction while another group with artillery made diversionary probes against the center defenses. The American militia on the right broke and ran almost immediately on seeing the British approach. Campbell then led an assault against the center. Howe’s defense collapsed and the city was captured after less than an hour of light fighting. Howe and others escaped, but Britain now had a southern operational base.
Losses: American, 83 dead or wounded, 453 captured; British, 3 dead, 10 wounded.
