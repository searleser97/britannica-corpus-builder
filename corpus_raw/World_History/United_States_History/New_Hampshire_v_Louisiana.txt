New Hampshire v. Louisiana,   (108 U.S. 76 [1883]), U.S. Supreme Court case (combined with New York v. Louisiana) concerning an attempt by the states of New Hampshire and New York to force Louisiana to pay interest on state bonds owned by citizens of the plaintiff states and assigned to those states for collection. Laws had been passed by New Hampshire in 1879 and by New York in 1880 under which a citizen of either of those states who held a valid, overdue claim against another state could assign the claim to his state in writing; the state attorney general could then bring suit against the defaulting state, and money that was recovered, less the costs of litigation, was to be given to the original owner. The Supreme Court dismissed the cases on the ground that the laws in question violated the spirit and purpose of the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, according to which “the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit” brought against one of the United States by citizens of another state.
