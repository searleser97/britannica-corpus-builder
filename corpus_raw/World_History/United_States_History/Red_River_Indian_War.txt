Red River Indian War,  (1874â€“75), uprising of warriors from several Indian tribes thought to be peacefully settled on Oklahoma and Texas reservations, ending in the crushing of the Indian dissidents by the United States. Presumably the Treaty of Medicine Lodge (Kansas, October 1867) had placed on area reservations a number of Southwestern tribes: the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa, and Kataka. Many braves, unwilling to accept this life of confinement, broke out repeatedly to raid white travelers and settlers. Encouraged by chiefs Big Tree and Satanta, Indians carried out an attack in 1874 that killed 60 Texans and launched the war. In the fall of 1874, about 3,000 federal infantry and cavalry, under the overall command of General William Tecumseh Sherman, converged on the Indians concentrated in the Red River valley, Texas. Resistance was so determined that 14 pitched battles were required to curb the Indian power by mid-November. The half-starved survivors surrendered the following summer and returned to their reservations.
