Anna Warner Bailey, née Anna Warner, byname Mother Bailey,  (born Oct. 11?, 1758, Groton, Conn. [U.S.]—died Jan. 10, 1851, Groton),  American patriot, the subject of heroic tales of the Revolutionary War and early America.
Anna Warner was orphaned and was reared by an uncle. On September 6, 1781, a large British force under the turncoat General Benedict Arnold landed on the coast near Groton and stormed Fort Griswold. American casualties were very high, and among them was Warner’s uncle, Edward Mills. She walked several miles to the scene of battle, found her uncle after much difficulty, and learned that he was mortally wounded. At his request she hurried home, saddled a horse for her aunt, and herself carried her infant cousin back for a last meeting of the family. This feat soon became a favourite tale of the Revolution. Warner later married Captain Elijah Bailey, postmaster of Groton. In 1813, during the second war with Great Britain, “Mother Bailey,” as she was then known, appeared among the Groton soldiers aiding in the defense of New London against a blockading British fleet. On learning of a shortage, she contributed her flannel petticoat—her “martial petticoat,” as it came to be known—for use as cartridge wadding.
