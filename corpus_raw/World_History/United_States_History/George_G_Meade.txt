George G. Meade,  (born Dec. 31, 1815, Cádiz, Spain—died Nov. 6, 1872, Philadelphia), American army officer who played a critical role in the American Civil War by defeating the Confederate Army at Gettysburg, Pa. (July 1863). As commander of the 3rd Military District in the south, Meade was noted for his firm justice, which helped to make the Reconstruction period following the war less painful.
The son of a U.S. naval agent in Spain, Meade graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., in 1835. He was commissioned in the artillery but resigned after a year’s service to work for a time as a surveyor. He reentered the army in 1842 and in August 1861 was commissioned brigadier general of volunteers in command of the 2nd Brigade of the Pennsylvania Reserves. After the disastrous Union defeat at Fredericksburg, Va., he was assigned the V Corps, which participated in the Chancellorsville, Va., campaign (April–May 1863).
On June 28, 1863, President Lincoln appointed Meade to replace General Joseph Hooker in command of the Army of the Potomac. Meade repulsed General Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg (July 1–3) with great tactical skill; however, he has been criticized by some for allowing Lee’s army to escape after this decisive victory. Although Meade retained command of the Army of the Potomac until the end of the war, his independence of action was sharply curtailed after March 1864, when General Ulysses S. Grant was placed in command of all Union forces. Meade was respected by his associates though he engaged in frequent quarrels. He was promoted to major general in the regular army (August 1864), and after the war he commanded several military departments.
