Siege of Boston,  (April 1775–March 1776), successful siege by American troops of the British-held city of Boston during the American Revolution. After the Battles of Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775), Boston was besieged by American militiamen. By June, 15,000 raw, undisciplined, ill-equipped colonials—by then called the Continental Army—surrounded a force of 6,500 British regulars commanded by General Thomas Gage.
After the Battle of Bunker Hill (June 17, 1775), General George Washington assumed command of American forces, while, in October of that year, General William Howe succeeded Gage as British commander. Fighting remained stalemated for months, with both sides hesitant to attack. Finally, on March 4, 1776, Washington seized Dorchester Heights and trained his cannon—newly arrived from Fort Ticonderoga—on the city and harbour. Howe was forced to evacuate Boston by ship (March 17), and the siege ended.
