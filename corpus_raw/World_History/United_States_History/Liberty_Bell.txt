Liberty Bell,  large bell, a traditional symbol of U.S. freedom, commissioned in 1751 by the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly to hang in the new State House (renamed Independence Hall) in Philadelphia. It was cast in London by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, purchased for about £100, and delivered in August 1752. It was cracked by a stroke of the clapper while being tested and was twice recast in Philadelphia before being hung in the State House steeple in June 1753. It weighs about 2,080 pounds (943 kg), is 12 feet (3.7 metres) in circumference around the lip, and measures 3 feet (1 metre) from lip to crown. It bears the motto, “Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof” (Leviticus 25:10).
The legend that on July 4, 1776, the bell was rung to signal the Continental Congress’ adoption of the Declaration of Independence is untrue; it was rung four days later on July 8 to celebrate the first public reading of the document. In 1777, when British forces entered Philadelphia, it was hidden in an Allentown, Pennsylvania, church. Restored to Independence Hall, it cracked, according to tradition, while tolling for the funeral of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835. The name “Liberty Bell” was first applied in 1839 in an abolitionist pamphlet. It was rung for the last time for George Washington’s birthday in 1846, during which it cracked irreparably. On January 1, 1976, the bell was moved to a pavilion about 100 yards (91 metres) from Independence Hall. In 2003 it was relocated to the newly built Liberty Bell Center, which is part of Independence National Historic Park. Some two million people visit the bell each year.
