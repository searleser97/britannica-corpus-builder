 The Supreme Court of the United States is the final court of appeal and final expositor of the Constitution of the United States. The justices are appointed by the president of the United States and must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The chief justice of the United States is also appointed by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. The number of justices fluctuated in the 18th and 19th centuries until 1869, when it was set at nine. A plan by Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt to allow him to appoint an additional justice for each member of the court age 70 years or older who refused to retire was rejected in the 1930s. This is a chronologically ordered list of Supreme Court justices, from the earliest to the most recent. The date the justice took the judicial oath is used as the beginning date of service. Chief justices are denoted by italic text.
