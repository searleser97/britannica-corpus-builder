Schenck v. United States,  legal case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on March 3, 1919, that the freedom of speech protection afforded in the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment could be restricted if the words spoken or printed represented to society a “clear and present danger.”
In June 1917, shortly after U.S. entry into World War I, Congress passed the Espionage Act, which made it illegal during wartime to
Charles T. Schenck was general secretary of the U.S. Socialist Party, which opposed the implementation of a military draft in the country. The party printed and distributed some 15,000 leaflets that called for men who were drafted to resist military service. Schenck was subsequently arrested for having violated the Espionage Act; he was convicted on three counts.
Oral arguments at the Supreme Court were heard on January 9, 1919, with Schenck’s counsel arguing that the Espionage Act was unconstitutional and that his client was simply exercising his freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. On March 3 the Court issued a unanimous ruling upholding the Espionage Act and Schenck’s conviction. Writing for the Court, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., argued that:
Throughout the 1920s, however, the Court abandoned the clear and present danger rule and instead utilized an earlier-devised “bad [or dangerous] tendency” doctrine, which enabled speech to be limited even more broadly than Holmes had allowed. In Gitlow v. New York (1925), for example, the Court upheld the conviction of Benjamin Gitlow for printing a manifesto that advocated the violent overthrow of the U.S. government, even though the manifesto’s publication did not create an “imminent and immediate danger” of the government’s destruction.
