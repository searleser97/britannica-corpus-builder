Bushrod Washington,  (born June 5, 1762, Westmoreland county, Virginia [U.S.]—died  November 26, 1829, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1798 to 1829.
A nephew of George Washington, he graduated in 1778 from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he was one of the original members of the Phi Beta Kappa society. He served in the Continental Army until the end of the American Revolution. He then studied law at Philadelphia under James Wilson, practiced law in Alexandria, Virginia, and moved to Richmond in 1790. He served in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1787 and sat in the Virginia state convention that ratified the federal Constitution in 1788.
In 1798 Washington was appointed to the Supreme Court by President John Adams. In 1802 John Marshall became chief justice, and Washington thereafter generally agreed with the important opinions Marshall rendered as chief justice. After the deaths of George and Martha Washington, Bushrod inherited their home, Mount Vernon, and part of their estate. He served as George Washington’s literary executor and supervised John Marshall’s Life of Washington, 5 vol. (1804–07).
