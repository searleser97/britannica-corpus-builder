Jonathan Odell,  (born Sept. 25, 1737, Newark, N.J., U.S.â€”died  Nov. 25, 1818, Fredericton, N.B., Can.), Canadian writer whose works are among the few extant expressions of American Tory sentiment during the Revolutionary War.
Educated in New Jersey, he was a surgeon in the British army, resigning to become an Anglican priest. During the Revolution he served as chaplain to a loyalist regiment, wrote bitterly satiric verses against the revolutionists, and played an active role in the negotiations between the American traitor Benedict Arnold and the British. His political satires and patriotic poems were collected and published in The Loyal Verses of Joseph Stansbury and Doctor Jonathan Odell (1860).
