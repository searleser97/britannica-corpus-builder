Benjamin R. Curtis, in full Benjamin Robbins Curtis,  (born November 4, 1809, Watertown, Massachusetts, U.S.—died September15, 1874, Newport, Rhode Island), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1851–57).
Curtis graduated from Harvard College, studied at the Harvard Law School, and took over the practice of a country attorney in Northfield, Massachusetts, in 1831. He quickly gained a reputation at the Boston bar for his ability. In 1846 he succeeded his teacher Joseph Story on the Harvard Corporation and in 1851 was elected to the state legislature.
An ardent Whig and supporter of Daniel Webster, Curtis was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1851 largely through his influence. He gave the opinion of the Court in Cooley v. Board of Port Wardens, which established the broad power of Congress to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and in Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, which confirmed the government’s power to assess and collect sums due to it by its agents without resort to law. His most famous, and last, opinion was his dissent in the Dred Scott case, in which his brother, George Ticknor Curtis (1812–94), was counsel for the slave Dred Scott, who sued unsuccessfully for his own and his family’s freedom. Benjamin Curtis maintained that the court could not decide the Scott case on the merits after having ruled that Scott himself had no standing before it. In the wake of an unpleasant public correspondence with Chief Justice Roger Taney, who had echoed slavers’ sentiments, Curtis resigned from the court.
Over the next 17 years he argued more than 50 cases before the Supreme Court and in 1868 was Pres. Andrew Johnson’s chief defense counsel in his impeachment trial.
