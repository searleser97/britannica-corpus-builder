Seneca Falls Convention,    assembly held on July 19–20, 1848, at Seneca Falls, New York, that launched the woman suffrage movement in the United States. Seneca Falls was the home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who, along with Lucretia Mott, conceived and directed the convention. The two feminist leaders had been excluded from participating in the 1840 World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, an event that solidified their determination to engage in the struggle.
At the 1848 convention Stanton read the “Declaration of Sentiments,” a statement of grievances and demands patterned closely after the Declaration of Independence. It called upon women to organize and to petition for their rights. The convention passed 12 resolutions—11 unanimously—designed to gain certain rights and privileges that women of the era were denied. The ninth resolution demanded the right to vote; passed narrowly upon the insistence of Stanton, it subjected the Seneca Falls Convention to subsequent ridicule and caused many backers of women’s rights to withdraw their support. It nonetheless served as the cornerstone of the woman suffrage movement that culminated in passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920.
