Black Friday,  in U.S. history, Sept. 24, 1869, when plummeting gold prices precipitated a securities market panic. The crash was a consequence of an attempt by financier Jay Gould and railway magnate James Fisk to corner the gold market and drive up the price. The scheme depended on keeping government gold off the market, which the manipulators arranged through political influence. When Pres. Ulysses S. Grant finally became aware of the scheme, he ordered $4,000,000 of government gold sold on the market. This broke the corner and, in the ensuing panic, the rest of the market as well. It hurt the economy and the reputation of the Grant administration.
