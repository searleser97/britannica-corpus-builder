Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, in full Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester of Dorchester,  (born September 3, 1724, Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland—died November 10, 1808, Stubbings, Berkshire, England), soldier-statesman who, as governor of Quebec before and during the American Revolutionary War, succeeded in reconciling the British and French and in repulsing the invasion attempts of Continental forces.
Carleton was commissioned an ensign in the British army in 1742, becoming a lieutenant colonel in 1757. Two years later he took part in the expedition against Quebec as quartermaster general under General James Wolfe; he was wounded at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. After two years as lieutenant governor of the province of Quebec, Carleton became governor (1768–78). His conciliatory policy toward the French Canadian landowners and clergy was confirmed by the British Parliament’s enactment of the Quebec Act of 1774, which, though it postponed the advent of representative government in Quebec, later formed the basis for the French Canadians’ political and religious rights.
After helping to repel the Continental Army’s invasion of Canada (1775–76), Carleton had a disagreement with the secretary of state for the colonies and retired. Four years later (in 1782) he was appointed commander in chief of British forces in North America. As governor in chief of British North America (1786–96), he promoted the Constitution Act of 1791, which helped develop representative institutions in Canada at a time when the French Revolution was threatening governments elsewhere. He retired to private life in England in 1796. He had been knighted in 1779 and created a baron in 1786.
