Sir James Craig, in full Sir James Henry Craig,  (born 1748, Gibraltar—died January 12, 1812, London, England), British soldier in the American Revolutionary War who later served as governor-general of Canada (1807–11) and was charged by French-Canadians with conducting a “reign of terror” in Quebec.
Craig entered the British army at the age of 15 and was made captain in 1771. In his Revolutionary War service he was wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill (June 17, 1775). He helped repel the Continental Army’s invasion of Canada (1776) and was noted for distinguished service in the early part of General John Burgoyne’s invasion of the Hudson River valley.
After fighting in North Carolina (1781), Craig was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He played a leading role in the capture (1795) of the Dutch colony of the Cape of Good Hope and served as its temporary governor (1795–97). Knighted in 1797, he was given commands in India and in England and saw service in the renewed Napoleonic Wars.
In 1807 Craig was appointed governor-general of Canada, a post to which he was temperamentally unsuited. His cooperation with the governing clique in Quebec and his repressive policy toward the French-Canadians were not popular. He resigned his post in 1811 and returned to England, where he was promoted to general just before his death.
