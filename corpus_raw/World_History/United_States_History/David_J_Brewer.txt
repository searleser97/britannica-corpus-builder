David J. Brewer, in full David Josiah Brewer,  (born June 20, 1837, Smyrna, Ottoman Empire [now İzmir, Turkey]—died  March 28, 1910, Washington, D.C., U.S.), U.S. Supreme Court justice from 1889 to 1910.
Brewer’s parents, American missionaries in Turkey, returned to the United States after his birth. He grew up in Connecticut, attended Yale University, and, after being admitted to the bar in 1858, worked as a notary public in Leavenworth, Kan. He served in various local judgeships (1861–70), on the Kansas Supreme Court (1870–84), and on the federal circuit court (1884–89).
In 1889 he was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Benjamin Harrison. During his 21 years on the bench, Brewer generally joined conservatives in resisting the trend toward an increase in the power and responsibility of the federal government. At the same time, speaking for the majority in the principal injunction case of the period, In re Debs (1895), he upheld the government’s use of the injunction against unlawful strikes. In a notable liberal departure, he wrote the majority opinion in Muller v. Oregon (1908), sustaining a state law that limited to 10 the daily working hours of women factory employees. From 1895 to 1897 he served as president of the commission appointed by Congress to investigate the boundary dispute between Venezuela and British Guiana.
