New Freedom,   in U.S. history, political ideology of Woodrow Wilson, enunciated during his successful 1912 presidential campaign, pledging to restore unfettered opportunity for individual action and to employ the power of government in behalf of social justice for all. Supported by a Democratic majority in Congress, Wilson succeeded during his first term in office (1913â€“17) in pushing through a number of meaningful measures: tariff reduction, banking regulations, antitrust legislation, beneficial farmer-labour enactments, and highway construction using state grants-in-aid. In actual practice the Wilsonian program enacted most of the proposals of his main 1912 presidential opponent, Progressive candidate Theodore Roosevelt. By the extensive use of federal power to protect the common man, the New Freedom anticipated the centralized approaches of the New Deal 20 years later.
