Ex Parte Quirin,  case in which the U.S. Supreme Court on July 31, 1942, unanimously ruled to allow the military, instead of civil courts, to try foreign nationals from enemy countries caught entering the United States to commit destructive acts.
The case of Ex Parte Quirin stemmed from a failed 1941 Nazi plan, known as Operation Pastorius, in which German submarines put two teams of infiltrators ashore in New York and Florida to sabotage defense-related industries in the United States. All of the saboteurs had been born in Germany, lived in the United States, and then returned to their homeland. However, before they could strike, one of the participants foiled the plot by revealing the details to the FBI. The eight saboteurs who had already entered the United States were subsequently arrested.
In a unanimous but highly debated decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the detainees did not have a right to a trial by jury. The Germans were convicted by a military tribunal, and six were executed. The others served almost six years in prison before being deported to Germany. Some legal scholars claimed that the ruling in Ex Parte Quirin ran counter to Ex Parte Milligan (1866), which prohibited military courts from trying enemy nationals if civilian courts were available.
