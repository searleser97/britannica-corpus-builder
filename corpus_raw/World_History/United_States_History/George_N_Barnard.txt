George N. Barnard, in full George Norman Barnard,  (born Dec. 23, 1819, Coventry, Conn., U.S.—died Feb. 4, 1902, Cedarvale?, N.Y.), American photographer who served as the official army photographer for Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman’s Military Division of the Mississippi during the American Civil War.
Barnard began producing daguerreotype photographs in his 20s, opening his first studio in Oswego, N.Y., in 1846. While in Oswego he captured shots of a burning mill in 1853—some of the earliest news photos ever taken. In the late 1850s he began working for noted photographer Edward Anthony, and shortly before the outbreak of civil war he started working for Mathew Brady. During that time he learned the collodion wet-plate process. Some of Barnard’s first wet-plate photographs were taken in 1862 at the Bull Run battlegrounds. The following year he was appointed official photographer for the Military Division of the Mississippi, documenting camps, fortifications, and rail lines and duplicating maps for Sherman and his men. In 1864–65 Barnard accompanied Sherman’s army on its invasion of Georgia and the “March to the Sea.”
After the war ended in 1865, Barnard returned to key battlefield areas that he had been unable to photograph—probably due to time constraints in processing photos on the battlefield—and captured more of the destruction the war had wrought. In 1866 he published Photographic Views of Sherman’s Campaign, which is considered one of the most important photographic books from the period. Barnard later worked as a photographer in numerous locations—including Chicago, where he set up a studio that was subsequently destroyed in the fire of 1871. He also briefly worked for George Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Company, in New York.
