Patrick Ferguson,  (born 1744, Pitfours, Aberdeenshire, Scot.—died Oct. 7, 1780, Kings Mountain, S.C., U.S.), British soldier, marksman, and inventor of the Ferguson flintlock rifle.
Ferguson served in the British army from 1759. In 1776 he patented a rifle—one of the earliest practical breechloaders—that was the best military firearm used in the American Revolution. His breechlock was grooved to prevent the action’s being jammed with powder. The rifle could be fired six times a minute, a major advance in firepower for the time, but because of official British conservatism not more than 200 of them were used in the war.
Ferguson led a small force armed with his rifle during the Pennsylvania campaign of 1777. At the Battle of Brandywine, his right arm was permanently crippled. Considered one of the British army’s best leaders of light troops, he recruited a corps of New York loyalists in 1779 for service in the American south, using it as a cadre for locally enlisted loyalist militia. All of these men carried muskets at the Battle of Kings Mountain in 1780, when Ferguson was killed and his unit annihilated.
