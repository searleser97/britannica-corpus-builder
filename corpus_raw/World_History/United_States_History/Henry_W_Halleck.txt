Henry W. Halleck,  (born Jan. 16, 1815, Westernville, N.Y., U.S.—died  Jan. 9, 1872, Louisville, Ky.), Union officer during the American Civil War who, despite his administrative skill as general in chief (1862–64), failed to achieve an overall battle strategy for Union forces.
A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. (1839), Halleck was commissioned in the engineers and sent in 1844 to visit the principal military establishments of Europe. After his return to the United States, he delivered a course of lectures on the science of war, published in 1846 as Elements of Military Art and Science, which was widely used as a textbook by volunteer officers during the Civil War. When the Mexican War broke out (1846), he served with the U.S. expedition to the Pacific Coast and became California’s secretary of state under the military government; in 1849 he helped frame the state constitution. Five years later he resigned his commission and took up the practice of law.
When war erupted between the states (1861), Halleck returned to the army as a major general and was charged with the supreme command of the Western theatre. There he was instrumental in bringing order out of chaos in the hurried formations of large volunteer armies, but the military successes of the spring of 1862 were due mainly to the military skill of such subordinate generals as Ulysses S. Grant and John Pope. In July, however, with some misgivings President Lincoln called Halleck to Washington as his military adviser and general in chief of the armies. Held responsible for subsequent reverses of Union generals in Virginia and frequently at odds with his subordinates and with the secretary of war, Edwin M. Stanton, he was replaced by Grant in March 1864. He then served as chief of staff until the end of the war.
