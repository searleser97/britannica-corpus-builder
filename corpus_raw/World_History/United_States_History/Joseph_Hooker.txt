Joseph Hooker,  (born Nov. 13, 1814, Hadley, Mass., U.S.—died  Oct. 31, 1879, Garden City, N.Y.), Union general in the American Civil War (1861–65) who successfully reorganized the Army of the Potomac in early 1863 but who thereafter earned a seesaw reputation for defeat and victory in battle.
A West Point graduate and veteran of the Mexican War (1846–48), Hooker left his California home at the outbreak of the Civil War to serve as brigadier general of volunteers. In 1862 he participated in all the major Eastern campaigns and was dubbed “Fighting Joe” because of his vigorous leadership in the field. When General A.E. Burnside resigned command of the Army of the Potomac after the Union disaster at Fredericksburg (November–December), Hooker was appointed to succeed him.
Immediately the new commander effected several much-needed organizational reforms and prepared to challenge the South at the Battle of Chancellorsville (May 1–4, 1863). His grave defects as a commanding officer became apparent when Confederate general Robert E. Lee, with fewer than half the number of troops, outmaneuvered him and caused a Union retreat. This defeat resulted in the loss of 17,000 Union soldiers. When Lee advanced into Pennsylvania in June, Hooker followed him closely until, rebuffed by Washington in his request for additional troops to meet the enemy at Gettysburg in July, he sensed his superiors’ distrust and resigned his command on the eve of battle.
Three months later Hooker was sent by rail in command of two corps of the Army of the Potomac to help relieve General W.S. Rosecrans, besieged at Chattanooga, Tenn. On Nov. 24, 1863, he won the “Battle Above the Clouds” on Lookout Mountain, clearing the way for the crowning Union victory on Missionary Ridge. Denied advancement during the Atlanta Campaign in 1864, he thereafter ceased to play any active part in the war.
