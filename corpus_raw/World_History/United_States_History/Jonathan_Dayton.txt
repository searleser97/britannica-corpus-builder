Jonathan Dayton,  (born Oct. 16, 1760, Elizabethtown (now Elizabeth), N.J. [U.S.]—died Oct. 9, 1824, Elizabethtown, N.J., U.S.), youngest member of the U.S. Constitutional Convention, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and developer of large tracts in what later became the state of Ohio. The city of Dayton, Ohio, is named for him.
Immediately following graduation from the College of New Jersey (Princeton University) in 1776, Dayton enlisted in the New Jersey militia. He fought in the New York and New Jersey campaigns, rose to the rank of captain, was at Yorktown in 1781, and returned to civilian life two years later.
Dayton then studied law and was admitted to the bar, but his future lay more in public service than in private law practice. He served in the New Jersey Assembly in 1786–87 and then—at age 27—became the youngest delegate at the Constitutional Convention. Dayton was a frequent participant in the debates and opposed several aspects of the Constitution. He nonetheless signed the final document.
Elected to a seat in the first Congress, Dayton instead served in the New Jersey Council (1789) and Assembly (1790), where he was speaker. But when elected once again to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1790, he joined that body and remained there until his fourth term expired in 1799. As a congressman, he backed Alexander Hamilton’s financial program, pressed for suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion, and supported the Jay Treaty with Great Britain (1794). During his last two terms he was speaker of the House.
Dayton was elected to the Senate, where he served for the term of 1799–1805. As a loyal Federalist, he opposed Thomas Jefferson’s administration by voting against the repeal of the Judiciary Act of 1801, against the Twelfth Amendment (specifying separate votes for president and vice president), and for the acquittal of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase. But he favoured the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.
After Dayton left the Senate in 1805, he held public office just once more in his life—a term in the New Jersey legislature (1814–15). Most of his time he devoted to developing his large landholdings (250,000 acres [101,175 hectares]) in Ohio. He apparently played some role in Aaron Burr’s western conspiracy of 1807 but—though indicted for high treason—was never prosecuted.
