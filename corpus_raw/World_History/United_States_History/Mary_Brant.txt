Mary Brant, byname Molly Brant,  (born 1736?, probably in the Mohawk Valley, New York [U.S.]—died April 16, 1796, Kingston, Ontario [Canada]), Native American leader, an influential and effective Iroquois ally to Great Britain in the American Revolution and later a founder of Kingston, Ontario.
Brant was of the Mohawk tribe, the daughter of a sachem (chief). Sometime in the late 1750s she came to the attention of Sir William Johnson, hero of Crown Point in the French and Indian War and superintendent of Indian affairs for the northern colonies. Following the death of his wife, he took a Mohawk woman as his mistress. Brant succeeded her and bore him eight or nine children while living with him at Fort Johnson and later Johnson Hall, his manorial estate. She also managed his household and entertained many distinguished Native American and colonial guests.
After Johnson’s death in 1774, Brant relinquished Johnson Hall to his eldest legitimate son and moved with her children to a farm near Canajoharie, New York. She and all of her family were loyalists during the Revolution. Her younger brother Joseph became a feared leader of warriors, notorious for the Cherry Valley Raid of November 11, 1778; her eldest son, Peter, was credited with the capture of Ethan Allen at Montreal in September 1775; and she herself conveyed intelligence on American movements and supplied ammunition to the British before the Battle of Oriskany, August 6, 1777. Her influence, both as the daughter of a sachem and as the consort of the popular Johnson, was decisive in bringing the entire Iroquois nation into the British camp, and she spent much of the war in the Tory stronghold of Niagara. After the war she settled in Ontario, where she and other loyalist refugees founded the town of Kingston. In 1783 she was granted a British pension for her services. Like her brother, she was in her last years a devout member of the Episcopal church.
