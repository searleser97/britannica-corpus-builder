Philip John Schuyler,  (born Nov. 11, 1733, Albany, N.Y.—died  Nov. 18, 1804, Albany, N.Y., U.S.), American soldier, political leader, and member of the Continental Congress. Born into a prominent New York family, Schuyler served in the provincial army during the last French and Indian War (1755–60), rising to the rank of major. After the war he went to England (1761–63) to help negotiate the settlement of colonial war claims. He served in the New York Assembly (1768–75) and was a delegate to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia (1775–77). When the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775 he was commissioned one of the four major generals in the Continental Army.
Placed in command of the northern department, he made preparations for an invasion of Canada, but shortly after the expedition started, he fell ill, and the actual command devolved upon Gen. Richard Montgomery. Nonetheless, when the invasion proved a failure Schuyler’s reputation suffered, and two years later, with the fall of Ft. Ticonderoga, N.Y., he was accused of incompetence and neglect of duty and was replaced by Gen. Horatio Gates. Court-martialled at his own insistence in 1778, Schuyler was acquitted of all charges, and resigned from the army the following year.
Schuyler was again a member of the Continental Congress (1778–80), and then served in the New York state senate (1780–84, 1786–90). He campaigned actively in New York for ratification of the new U.S. Constitution, and was one of his state’s first two U.S. senators (1789–91). In 1791 he was defeated for reelection by Aaron Burr, and returned to the state senate (1792–97). He recaptured his seat from Burr in 1797, but was forced by ill health to retire less than a year later.
