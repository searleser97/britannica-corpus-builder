Battle of Eutaw Springs,  (September 8, 1781), American Revolution engagement fought near Charleston, South Carolina, between British troops under Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Stewart and American forces commanded by General Nathanael Greene. Greene wished to prevent Stewart from joining General Lord Cornwallis in the event of that leaderâ€™s retreat south from Yorktown. About 2,000 American troops, many ill-clad and barefoot, were slightly outnumbered. In the early fighting the British were more successful; on September 9, however, Stewart withdrew his forces to Charleston, where they remained until the end of the war.
