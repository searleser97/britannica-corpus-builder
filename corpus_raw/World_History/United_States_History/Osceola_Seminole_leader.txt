Osceola,  (born c. 1804, Georgia, U.S.—died  January 30, 1838, Charleston, South Carolina), American Indian leader during the Second Seminole War, which began in 1835 when the U.S. government attempted to force the Seminole off their traditional lands in Florida and into the Indian territory west of the Mississippi River.
Osceola moved from Georgia to Florida, where, although not a chief, he came to be acknowledged as a leader of the Seminoles. He led the young Indians who opposed the Treaty of Payne’s Landing (1832), by which some of the Seminole chiefs agreed to submit to removal from Florida. In 1835 he and a group of braves murdered Charley Emathla, a chief who was preparing to emigrate with his people, and Gen. Wiley Thompson, the U.S. Indian agent at Ft. King.
For the next two years, U.S. troops attempted to crush Seminole opposition. The Indians withdrew into the Everglades and fought back, employing guerrilla tactics. In October 1837 Osceola and several chiefs went to St. Augustine, Florida, under a flag of truce to attend a parley with Gen. T.S. Jesup. By special order of the general, the Indians were seized and imprisoned. Osceola was removed to Ft. Moultrie at Charleston, South Carolina, where he died. The war continued until 1842, but only sporadically after Osceola’s death.
