John Graves Simcoe,  (born February 25, 1752, Cotterstock, Northamptonshire, England—died  October 26, 1806, Exeter, Devonshire), British soldier and statesman who became the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada (present-day Ontario).
Simcoe—educated at Exeter Grammar School, Eton College, and Oxford University—entered the British army as an ensign in 1770. He served during the American Revolution (1775–83) and was promoted to captain in 1775. In 1777–81 he commanded the newly formed Queen’s Rangers and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1778. Taken prisoner in 1779, he was subsequently released and, in 1781, invalided back to England, where he married and settled on a country estate in Devon that had been purchased by his wealthy wife.
Simcoe entered politics as member of Parliament for St. Mawes, Cornwall, in 1790. After passage of the Constitutional Act of 1791, which gave representative government to Canada, he was appointed the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. As lieutenant governor, he encouraged immigration and agriculture and supported defense and road building, but he was in frequent conflict with the governor in chief, Lord Dorchester. Simcoe was made a major general in 1794.
Simcoe left Canada in 1796. He served briefly as governor and commander in chief of Santo Domingo (now Hispaniola) in 1797 and was promoted to lieutenant general. Back in England he took command of the Western District at Exeter. He was appointed commander in chief in India in 1806, but he fell ill on his way there; he returned to England, where he died.
