Minor v. Happersett,  U.S. Supreme Court case in which the court ruled unanimously in 1874 that the right of suffrage was not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The case was brought on appeal by Virginia Minor, an officer of the National Woman Suffrage Association, and her husband, Francis Minor, who argued the case before the court. In 1872 Virginia Minor had been barred from registering to vote in St. Louis on the basis of a Missouri law that restricted the right of suffrage to men. Charging that she had been denied one of the “privileges and immunities of citizenship” guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, Minor and her husband sued the voting registrar, Reese Happersett.
In its decision the Supreme Court declared that the privileges and immunities of citizenship are not defined by the U.S. Constitution; thus, individual states’ enfranchisement of male citizens only was not necessarily a violation of the citizenship rights of women. This finding effectively put an end to attempts to win voting rights for women through court decree. Subsequent efforts in the woman suffrage movement in the United States focused on the revision of voting laws of individual states and on the ratification of a separate amendment to the Constitution.
