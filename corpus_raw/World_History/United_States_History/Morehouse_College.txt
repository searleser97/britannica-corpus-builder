The Augusta Institute was founded in 1867 in Augusta, Georgia, and moved to Atlanta in 1879, becoming Atlanta Baptist Seminary. When it became Atlanta Baptist College in 1897, much of its curriculum resembled that of a high school. After the noted educator John Hope became president in 1906, the curriculum expanded, and the school became Morehouse College. In 1929 Atlanta University and Morehouse and Spelman colleges agreed to share resources. The agreement led to the formation of the Atlanta University Center, in which six institutions of higher learning exchange faculty, students, facilities, and curricula. The Morehouse School of Medicine was founded as part of the college in 1978 and became independent three years later. Notable alumni include Martin Luther King, Jr., civil-rights leader Julian Bond, and filmmaker Spike Lee.
