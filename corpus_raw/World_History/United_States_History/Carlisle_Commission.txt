Carlisle Commission, also called Peace Commission of 1778,  during U.S. War of Independence, group of British negotiators sent in 1778, to effect a reconciliation with the 13 insurgent colonies by a belated offer of self-rule within the empire. Shocked by the British defeat at Saratoga (concluded Oct. 17, 1777) and fearful of French recognition of American independence, Prime Minister Lord North induced Parliament to repeal (February 1778) such offensive measures as the Tea Act and the Massachusetts Government Act and to establish a commission to seek a negotiated settlement with the Americans. Headed by Frederick Howard, 5th earl of Carlisle, the commissioners set out in April, although they knew that the Franco-American Alliance had already been formed. Meanwhile, withdrawal of the main British army from Philadelphia to New York further stiffened American resolve to accept nothing short of independence, which the commission was not authorized to grant. Despite persistent propaganda and bribery attempts, the commission was unable to plead its case successfully.
