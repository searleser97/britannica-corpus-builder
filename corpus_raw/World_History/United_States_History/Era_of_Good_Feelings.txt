Era of Good Feelings, also called Era of Good Feeling,  national mood of the United States from 1815 to 1825, as first described by the Boston Columbian Centinel on July 12, 1817. Although the “era” generally is considered coextensive with President James Monroe’s two terms (1817–25), it really began in 1815, when for the first time, thanks to the ending of the Napoleonic Wars, American citizens could afford to pay less attention to European political and military affairs. The predominant attitude was what in the 20th century became known as isolationism. The good feelings, perhaps better termed complacency, were stimulated by two events of 1816, during the last year of the presidency of James Madison: the enactment of the first U.S. avowedly protective tariff and the establishment of the second National Bank. With the decline of the Federalists the United States was, in practice if not in theory, a one-party state on the national level; heading the Democratic-Republicans, Monroe secured all but one electoral vote in 1820. Sectionalism was in comparative abeyance, replaced by a rather unassertive nationalism. But by 1820 a longer era of conflict might have been foretold; varying sectional interests, particularly regarding slavery and expansion, developed during Monroe’s second term. The “era” proved to be a temporary lull in personal and political leadership clashes while new issues were emerging.
