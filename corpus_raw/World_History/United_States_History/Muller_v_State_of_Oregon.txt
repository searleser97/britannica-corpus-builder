Muller v. State of Oregon,  U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 1908 that, although it appeared to promote the health and welfare of female workers, in fact led to additional protective legislation that was detrimental to equality in the workplace for years to come. At issue was an Oregon law passed in 1903 that prohibited women from working more than 10 hours in one day. Curt Muller, a laundry owner, was charged in 1905 with permitting a supervisor to require Mrs. E. Gotcher to work more than 10 hours and was fined $10.
Before the U.S. Supreme Court, Muller’s attorney, William D. Fenton, contended that the statute violated Mrs. Gotcher’s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process by preventing her from freely contracting with her employer. However, the attorney for the state, Louis D. Brandeis, chose to argue on the grounds that women needed “special protection” by virtue of their physical differences from men. In what became known as the “Brandeis brief,” a 113-page document outlining quasiscientific data on the negative effects of long working hours on both women and men, he focused particularly on women’s dependent and biologically reproductive roles as opposed to economic issues. The court, referring to the “proper discharge of her maternal functions” and the “well-being of the race,” wrote that a woman “is properly placed in a class by herself, and legislation designed for her protection may be sustained, even when like legislation is not necessary for men, and could not be sustained.”
Although contemporary Progressive reformers applauded the decision as a victory in the battle for improved working conditions for women, some equal rights feminists recognized that the decision offered protection by reinforcing gender stereotypes, an argument that would ultimately restrict the economic opportunities available to women.
