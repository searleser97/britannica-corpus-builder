Ellen Arthur, née Ellen Lewis Herndon, byname Nell,  (born August 30, 1837, Culpeper, Virginia, U.S.—died January 12, 1880, New York, New York), wife of Chester A. Arthur, 21st president of the United States. She never served as first lady because she died of pneumonia before her husband assumed office. The president’s sister, Mary Arthur McElroy, acted as White House hostess.
Ellen Lewis Herndon was the daughter of naval officer William Lewis Herndon, who explored the Amazon River and was one of the founders of the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. In 1856 a cousin introduced Ellen to Arthur, and they married on October 25, 1859. Their first son, born in 1860, died within three years. The couple had two more children—a son in 1864 and a daughter in 1871. The family was prosperous and liked to entertain guests in their fashionable New York City home.
With the election of 1880, Arthur became vice president on the Republican ticket of James A. Garfield. Ellen died shortly thereafter and was buried in Albany, New York. In September 1881 Garfield was assassinated and Arthur assumed the office. As a widower, he asked his sister to welcome guests at the White House and to help raise his children.
