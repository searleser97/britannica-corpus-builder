Gideon Welles,  (born July 1, 1802, Glastonbury, Conn., U.S.—died  Feb. 11, 1878, Hartford, Conn.), U.S. secretary of the navy under presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.
Born into a wealthy family, Welles was educated at private schools. He studied law but in 1826 became cofounder and editor of the Hartford Times. The next year, he became the youngest member of the Connecticut legislature and served there until 1835. An ardent Jacksonian Democrat, he was responsible for Connecticut’s general incorporation law, which became a model for other states.
Welles was elected state controller of public accounts in 1835; he was reelected in 1842 and 1843. Jackson appointed him postmaster of Hartford in 1836, and Welles served until the Whigs took power in 1841. From 1846 to 1849 he was chief of the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing for the Navy.
In 1854 Welles quit the Democrats and switched to the Republican Party. In 1856 he founded the Hartford Evening Press, one of the first Republican papers in New England, and wrote for it extensively.
In 1861 Lincoln made Welles secretary of the Navy, in part fulfilling a political obligation to put a New Englander in the Cabinet. Welles proved to be a highly competent administrator and a surprisingly keen military strategist. He quickly built a large and effective navy from a few ships and a force reduced by the departure of Confederate sympathizers. Undisturbed by criticism, he authorized the construction of ironclads, kept his department as free from graft as possible, and promoted officers of merit over those with great seniority. He was largely responsible for implementing the “Anaconda plan” of slowly squeezing the South into submission, and he effectively directed the naval blockade that isolated the South and severed it in half.
In 1869 Welles left the Cabinet, having completed the longest term as Navy secretary to that time. He then drifted from the Republican Party, backing the Liberal Republicans in 1872 and Democrat Samuel Tilden in 1876. He spent his final years writing magazine articles and a book, Lincoln and Seward (1874). Long after his death the Diary of Gideon Welles (1911) was published, a work highly regarded by historians for its insights into the people and events of the Civil War era.
