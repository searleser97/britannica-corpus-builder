John L. Worden,  (born March 12, 1818, Westchester county, N.Y., U.S.—died  Oct. 18, 1897, Washington, D.C.), U.S. naval officer who commanded the Union warship Monitor against the Confederate Virginia (formerly Merrimack) in the first battle between ironclads (March 9, 1862) in the American Civil War (1861–65).
Appointed a midshipman in 1834, Worden received his early naval training with the Brazilian squadron (1835–38). He served on the Pacific Coast during the Mexican War (1846–48) and afterward in both the Mediterranean and the home fleets.
On Jan. 16, 1862, Worden was appointed to command John Ericsson’s experimental ship, the Monitor. In March he took the cumbersome “cheese box on a raft” down the Atlantic Coast in perilous, stormy weather and engaged the larger ironclad Virginia at the mouth of the James River. The three-hour battle ended when both withdrew from the conflict. Worden, stationed in the pilothouse, had been wounded in the face, however, and nearly blinded by a shell.
For the rest of the war, he commanded monitors stationed with the South Atlantic blockading squadron. Afterward he was promoted to rear admiral (1872) and commanded the European squadron (1875–77). He was retired by Congress in 1886 at full pay for life.
