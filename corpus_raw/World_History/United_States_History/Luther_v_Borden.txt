Luther v. Borden,   (1849), U.S. Supreme Court decision growing out of the 1842 conflict in Rhode Island called the “Dorr Rebellion.”
In the spring of 1842, Rhode Island had two governors and two legislatures. One government was committed to retaining the old colonial charter, which severely limited voting rights, as the state’s constitution. The other government, led by Thomas W. Dorr and providing for white manhood suffrage, took control over northwestern Rhode Island. The Dorr government eventually took military action, but its attempt to seize a state arsenal proved unsuccessful. Meanwhile, the more conservative government declared martial law. A suit arising from the conflict reached the Supreme Court.
The Court evaded the issue as to which Rhode Island government was legitimate. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney’s opinion said that the president and Congress must make that decision, the Congress, under Article IV Section 4 of the Constitution, having the power to guarantee republican government in the states and to recognize lawful state governments. Taney did state, however, that existing state authority (the conservative government) was legally empowered to use martial law in the face of a violent insurrection.
