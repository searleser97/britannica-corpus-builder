Texas v. Johnson,  legal case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (5–4) on June 21, 1989, that the burning of the U.S. flag is a protected form of speech under the  First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
The case originated during the Republican National Convention in Dallas in August 1984, where the party had gathered to nominate Pres. Ronald Reagan as its candidate in that year’s presidential election. Gregory Lee Johnson, part of a group that had gathered to protest Reagan’s policies, doused an American flag with kerosene and lit it on fire in front of the Dallas City Hall. He was arrested for violating Texas’s state law that prohibited desecration of the U.S. flag and eventually was convicted; he was fined and sentenced to one year in jail. His conviction subsequently was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (the state’s highest appeals court for criminal cases), which argued that symbolic speech was protected by the First Amendment.
The case was accepted for review by the Supreme Court, and oral arguments were heard in March 1989. In June the Court released a controversial 5–4 ruling in which it upheld the appeals court decision that desecration of the U.S. flag was constitutionally protected, calling the First Amendment’s protection of speech a “bedrock principle” and stating that the government could not prohibit “expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable.” Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., noted for his liberal jurisprudence, wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by his fellow liberal justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun and by two conservative justices, Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia.
