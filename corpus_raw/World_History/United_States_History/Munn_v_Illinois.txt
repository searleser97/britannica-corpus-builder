Munn v. Illinois,   (1877), case in which the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the power of government to regulate private industries.
The case developed as a result of the Illinois legislature’s responding in 1871 to pressure from the National Grange, an association of farmers, by setting maximum rates that private companies could charge for the storage and transport of agricultural products. The Chicago grain warehouse firm of Munn and Scott was subsequently found guilty of violating the law but appealed the conviction on the grounds that the Illinois regulation represented an unconstitutional deprivation of property without due process of law.
The Supreme Court heard the appeal in 1877. Chief Justice Morrison Remick Waite spoke for the majority when he said that state power to regulate extends to private industries that affect the public interest. Because grain storage facilities were devoted to public use, their rates were subject to public regulation. Moreover, Waite declared that even though Congress alone is granted control over interstate commerce, a state could take action in the public interest without impairing that federal control.
Munn v. Illinois, one of the Granger cases (see Granger movement), was a watershed in the struggle for public regulation of private enterprise. Later court decisions, however, sharply curtailed the government’s power to regulate business.
