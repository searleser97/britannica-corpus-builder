Henry Brockholst Livingston,  (born Nov. 25, 1757, New York, N.Y. [U.S.]â€”died  March 18, 1823, Washington, D.C.), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1806 to 1823.
Livingston joined the Continental Army at the age of 19 and saw action with Benedict Arnold and as an aide to General Philip John Schuyler and General Arthur St. Clair before accompanying his brother-in-law, John Jay, on his mission to solicit aid from Spain in 1779. On his return voyage he was captured by the British and, upon being paroled, studied law at Albany, being admitted to the bar in 1783. He had a successful practice in New York City until 1802, when he was appointed to the state Supreme Court. In 1806 Livingston was named to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Thomas Jefferson. There he was overshadowed by Chief Justice John Marshall and wrote no major opinions on constitutional questions.
