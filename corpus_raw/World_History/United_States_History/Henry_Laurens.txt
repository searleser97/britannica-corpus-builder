Henry Laurens,  (born March 6, 1724, Charleston, S.C. [U.S.]—died  Dec. 8, 1792, near Charleston, S.C., U.S.), early American statesman who served as president of the Continental Congress (1777–78).
After pursuing a profitable career as a merchant and planter, Laurens espoused the patriot cause in the disputes with Great Britain preceding the American Revolution. He was made president of the South Carolina Council of Safety and vice president of the state in 1776. Sent as a delegate to the Continental Congress meeting at Philadelphia, he was soon elected chief officer of that body.
In August 1780 Laurens embarked on a mission to Holland to negotiate on behalf of Congress a $10,000,000 loan, but he was captured off Newfoundland and imprisoned in the Tower of London. When his papers were found to contain a draft of a proposed treaty between the Americans and the Dutch, war broke out between Great Britain and Holland. On Dec. 31, 1781, he was released on parole and finally exchanged for the British general Charles Cornwallis. The following June he was appointed one of the U.S. commissioners for negotiating peace with the British, but, because of failing health, he was absent from the signing of the final peace treaty and retired to his plantation.
