Gibbons v. Ogden,   (1824), U.S. Supreme Court case establishing the principle that states cannot, by legislative enactment, interfere with the power of Congress to regulate commerce. The state of New York agreed in 1798 to grant Robert Fulton and his backer, Robert R. Livingston, a monopoly on steamboat navigation in state waters if they developed a steamboat capable of traveling 4 miles (6.4 km) per hour upstream on the Hudson River. Fulton and Livingston satisfied the condition of the grant in 1807. Subsequently, Aaron Ogden purchased from Fulton and Livingston rights to operate steamboats between New York City and New Jersey. In 1819 Ogden sued Thomas Gibbons, who was operating steamboats in the same waters without the authority of Fulton and Livingston. Ogden won in 1820 in the New York Court of Chancery.
Gibbons appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, contending that he was protected by terms of a federal license to engage in coasting trade. His case was argued before the Supreme Court by Daniel Webster, the leading lawyer of the era, and in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Marshall, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Gibbons. The decision was an important development in interpretation of the commerce clause of the Constitution, and it freed all navigation of monopoly control. The dismantling of navigational monopolies in New York and Louisiana, in particular, facilitated the settlement of the American West.
