Pascual Cervera y Topete,  (born Feb. 18, 1839, Medina Sidonia, Spain—died  April 3, 1909, Puerto Real), Spanish admiral whose fleet was destroyed in battle off Cuba in the Spanish–American War (1898).
A graduate of a naval cadet school, he engaged in operations off Morocco and in the Sulu Islands and the Philippines. Afterward he was on the West Indian station during the early part of the first Cuban War (1868–78), returning to Spain in 1873 to serve on the Basque coast against the Carlists. Over the years he rose to flag rank and in 1892 became minister of marine in the cabinet of Praxedes Mateo Sagasta; he soon resigned, however, when he was unable to receive backing for naval reforms and added funds.
In April 1898, when the Spanish-American War broke out, Cervera was chosen to command a squadron composed of four cruisers and several destroyers stationed in the Cape Verde Islands. This ill-fated squadron started upon its reckless cruise across the ocean only after its commander had repeatedly sent dispatches warning both the minister of marine and the prime minister, Sagasta, that the ships were insufficiently provided with coal and ammunition. In compliance with the instructions of the government, Admiral Cervera made for the landlocked harbour of Santiago de Cuba, where he cooperated in the defense by landing some guns and a naval brigade. In spite of his energetic representations, Cervera received an order from Madrid, dictated by political considerations, to sally forth. The squadron met forces trebly superior to it and was totally destroyed. The admiral, three of his captains, and 1,800 sailors and marines were taken by the victors to Portsmouth, N.H. After the war Cervera and his captains were tried before the supreme naval and military court of Spain, which honourably acquitted them all. In 1901 he became vice admiral, in 1902 was appointed chief of staff of the Spanish navy, and in 1903 was made life senator.
