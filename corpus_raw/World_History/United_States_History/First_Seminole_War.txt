First Seminole War,  conflict between U.S. armed forces and the Seminole Indians of Florida that is generally dated to 1817–18 and that led Spain to cede Florida to the United States.
The Seminoles were largely of Creek origin and lived in villages in northern Florida. The area was also home to a number of Africans, free African Americans, and runaway African American slaves, all of whom were known as Black Seminoles. The Seminoles and Black Seminoles were aligned with the British against the Americans before and during the War of 1812 and were the targets of frequent raids by militias from Georgia, who sought runaway slaves as well as land and cattle. In 1816, U.S. soldiers destroyed a garrison that was a refuge for escaped slaves, killing some 270 people. The Seminoles subsequently began raiding American settlements along the Georgia–Florida border. In what many writers identify as the beginning of the First Seminole War, in November 1817, U.S. soldiers attacked the Seminole village of Fowltown (near present-day Bainbridge, Georgia), and a battle ensued. In retaliation, a group of Seminoles laid siege to a boat carrying reinforcements to Fort Scott on the Apalachicola River and killed 43 men, women, and children.
In December 1817, U.S. General Andrew Jackson was given command of U.S. forces in the area. In the following spring, he led troops against Seminole villages on Lake Miccosukee and along the Suwannee River, destroying them as he went. In addition, he seized the Spanish military post at what is now St. Marks and then proceeded to take the Spanish-held town of Pensacola. Jackson’s military successes paved the way for Spain’s agreement to relinquish its territory in Florida to the United States under the terms of the 1819 Transcontinental Treaty.
