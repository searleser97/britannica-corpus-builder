Fitz-John Porter,  (born Aug. 31, 1822, Portsmouth, N.H., U.S.—died May 21, 1901, Morristown, N.J.), Union general during the American Civil War who was court-martialed and cashiered—but later vindicated—for disobeying orders at the Second Battle of Bull Run.
Porter was educated at Phillips Exeter Academy and at West Point, graduating from the latter in 1845. He fought in the Mexican War (1846–48) and from 1849 to 1855 was an instructor at West Point. After the outbreak of the Civil War, Porter was made a brigadier general of volunteers (May 1861). He distinguished himself during General George B. McClellan’s 1862 Peninsular Campaign, but on August 29 of that year he failed to comply with General John Pope’s orders to attack the right flank of Stonewall Jackson’s forces at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Pope claimed that the subsequent Confederate victory resulted from Porter’s disobedience and misconduct.
In November 1862 Porter was relieved of his command and court-martialed. The trial continued on into January 1863, Porter claiming that Pope’s orders had been vague, contradictory, and impossible to execute. But on January 21, Porter was found guilty and immediately cashiered.
After the end of the war, Porter entered the mercantile business in New York. He later served as commissioner of public works, police commissioner, and fire commissioner of New York City. The most notable aspect of Porter’s postwar career, however, was his dogged pursuit of vindication for his alleged misdeeds at Bull Run. No sooner was his court-martial concluded than he started efforts to clear his name. Finally, in 1879, he won a review of his case, a review that supported his claim of innocence. But it was not until 1886 that he was reappointed an army officer and placed, at his own request, on the retired list.
