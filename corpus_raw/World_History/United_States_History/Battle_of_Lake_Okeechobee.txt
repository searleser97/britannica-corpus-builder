Battle of Lake Okeechobee,  (25–28 December 1837).  Conflict in the Florida territory between U.S. settlers and Seminole Indians erupted into major violence in December 1835. Seminole warriors murdered a senior Indian agent and a U.S. army officer, then massacred a column of soldiers, igniting the Second Seminole War (1835–42).
In September 1837, Major General Thomas Jesup, army commander in Florida, received reinforcements. Among the units was the 1st Infantry regiment under Colonel Zachary Taylor. He was given an area of operations near swampy Lake Okeechobee and 1,032 men: regulars, mounted volunteers, and scouts to hunt the enemy.
On 25 December, a Seminole was captured in an empty camp. He pointed the location of the other warriors: a hammock of dry woodland surrounded by a swamp filled with water and mud and covered with high sawgrass. Led by three war chiefs, some 400 Seminole warriors waited behind prepared log breastworks. Shooting lanes had been cut through the grass for musket fire.
Taylor placed dismounted volunteers and scouts in the front line followed by a rank of the 4th Infantry and 6th Infantry. He held the 1st Infantry and artillery men in reserve. Struggling through thigh-deep mud, the volunteers and 6th Infantry sustained heavy casualties. The commander was killed, as were many officers. Most of the sergeants of the 6th were shot down. Seeing his ranks heavily engaged and moving slowly, Taylor sent his reserve, the 1st Infantry, to move against the Seminole’s right flank. Movement through the swamp was slow, but eventually the Seminole war chiefs realized they were in danger of being surrounded. After three hours of steady fighting, the warriors’ defense collapsed.
Both sides claimed victory after the battle, with Taylor earning the moniker "Old Rough and Ready."
Losses: U.S., 26 dead, 112 wounded, 1 missing; Seminole, 11 dead, 14 wounded, 180 captured.
