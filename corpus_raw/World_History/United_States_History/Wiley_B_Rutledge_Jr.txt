Wiley B. Rutledge, Jr., in full Wiley Blount Rutledge, Jr.,  (born July 20, 1894, Cloverport, Kentucky, U.S.—died September 10, 1949, York, Maine), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1943–49).
Rutledge taught high school and studied law in his youth, receiving his law degree from the University of Colorado in 1922. After two years of private practice, he taught law at various universities until his appointment to the federal Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia in 1939. In 1943 President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Rutledge to the Supreme Court.
Rutledge was almost immediately called upon to cast the deciding vote in several important cases, including West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, which involved the right of Jehovah’s Witnesses to refuse to salute the flag, and Schneiderman v. United States, the case of a California resident whose naturalization had been revoked because of his communist beliefs. In both cases he voted with the court’s liberal bloc.
Rutledge’s work was painstaking and his opinions frequently encyclopaedic. Some of his opinions contained basic analyses of technical legal problems, especially those having to do with government agencies. He wrote several noted and controversial opinions, including his dissent against the execution of the Japanese general Yamashita Tomoyuki (In re Yamashita, 1946) for war crimes. Rutledge objected to the use of hearsay evidence in the trial and won wide public approval for his defense of the right of even a defeated enemy to a fair trial.
