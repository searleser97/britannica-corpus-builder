Richard Heron Anderson,  (born Oct. 7, 1821, Statesburg, S.C., U.S.—died  June 26, 1879, Beaufort, S.C.), Confederate general in the American Civil War.
Anderson graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1842 and won the brevet of first lieutenant in the Mexican War, becoming first lieutenant in 1848 and captain in 1855; he took part in the following year in the Kansas troubles. At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he resigned from the U.S. Army and entered the Confederate service as a brigadier general, being promoted major general on July 14, 1862. Except for a few months spent with the army under Braxton Bragg in 1862, Anderson’s service was wholly in the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee.
In the Wilderness campaign, in May 1864, he succeeded to the command of the 1st Corps when Longstreet was wounded. After saving Spotsylvania by a brilliant night march on May 7–8, at the outset of the punishing Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse, Anderson was given the rank of temporary lieutenant general. He later participated in the defense of Petersburg and Richmond. After the war Anderson became a railroad official in South Carolina and then state phosphate inspector.
