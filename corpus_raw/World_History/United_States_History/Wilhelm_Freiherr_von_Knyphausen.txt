Wilhelm, baron von Knyphausen,  (born November 4, 1716, Luxembourg—died  December 7, 1800, Kassel, Hesse-Kassel [Germany]), German soldier who after 1777 commanded “Hessian” troops on the British side in the American Revolution.
A lieutenant general with 42 years of military service, Knyphausen went to North America in 1776 as second in command (under General Leopold von Heister) of German mercenary troops in the British service. Following Heister’s recall in 1777, Knyphausen became their commander. He took part in the battles of Fort Washington and Brandywine, Pennsylvania, and Monmouth, New Jersey; Sir Henry Clinton’s absence from New York in 1779–80 left the area under the command of Knyphausen. An able soldier, he carried out the difficult task of holding together the mercenary forces under his command. He returned to Germany in 1782 and became military governor of Kassel.
