Carlo Giuseppe Guglielmo Botta,  (born Nov. 6, 1766, San Giorgio del Canavese, Piedmont [Italy]—died  Aug. 10, 1837, Paris, France), Italian-born French historian and politician who supported Napoleon.
Having graduated in medicine at the University of Turin in 1786, Botta was in his youth inspired by the ideas of the French Revolution. Arrested as a spy for the French in 1794, he left Italy for France the following year and from 1796 to 1798 served as a physician in Napoleon’s campaigns in Italy and Corfu. He published a history of Corfu in 1799 and in the same year became a member of the Franco-Italian government of Piedmont.
An ardent supporter of Napoleon, though he later contributed to Napoleon’s fall, he was elected vice president of the French legislative assembly in 1808. In 1815 he became a French citizen and was subsequently appointed rector of the academies of Nancy and Rouen.
His main work is a fanciful history of the American Revolution, based on contemporary documents and material supplied by Lafayette. An English translation, History of the War of the Independence of the United States of America, was published in Philadelphia (1820–21).
