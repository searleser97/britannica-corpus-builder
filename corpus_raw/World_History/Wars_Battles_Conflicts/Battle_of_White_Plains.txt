Battle of White Plains,  (Oct. 28, 1776), in the U.S. War of Independence, indecisive action forcing American withdrawal, part of the British campaign of 1776 to defeat American Gen. George Washington’s main army or isolate the New England colonies by gaining military control of New York. From his strengthened position facing the American lines on Harlem Heights, at the northern tip of Manhattan Island, British Gen. Sir William Howe moved most of his army into Westchester county via amphibious landings at Throg’s Neck (October 12) and then Pell’s Point (October 18). To prevent his army’s being surrounded, Washington left a garrison at Fort Washington, his main redoubt on Harlem Heights, and marched most of his force north into Westchester, finally setting up fortified lines near White Plains. Following some small actions, Howe advanced his force of 10,000–15,000 in two columns toward Washington’s positions. On October 28, in a brief, sharp action, a Continental brigade was defeated at Chatterton Hill. Howe’s plan for further action over the next few days was delayed by a heavy rain, and Washington was able to withdraw his 14,000 men farther north to more secure ground. Howe then withdrew most of his men to Manhattan and prepared to attack Fort Washington.
