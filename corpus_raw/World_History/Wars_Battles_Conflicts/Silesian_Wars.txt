Silesian Wars,   18th-century contests between Austria and Prussia for the possession of Silesia. The First Silesian War (1740–42) and the Second Silesian War (1744–45) formed parts of the great European struggle called the War of the Austrian Succession (see Austrian Succession, War of the). The Third Silesian War (1756–62) similarly formed a part of the Seven Years’ War (q.v.). 
Resurrecting an old Brandenburg testamentary claim to Silesia, Frederick II the Great of Prussia invaded the Austrian province in December 1740 and, after several months of warding off Austrian counterattacks, was left in virtual control of Silesia by the Truce of Klein Schnellendorf (Oct. 9, 1741). After further warfare from December 1741 to June 1742, the empress Maria Theresa of Austria decided to make peace with Frederick, ceding in the Treaty of Breslau (June 11, 1742) all of Silesia except the districts of Troppau, Teschen, and Jägerndorf. The Second Silesian War, climaxed by a series of Prussian victories, again confirmed Frederick’s conquest of Silesia (Treaty of Dresden, Dec. 25, 1745).
A decade later, Maria Theresa’s tenacious endeavour to recover her lost province again proved unsuccessful, although in the Seven Years’ War she came near to success. An armistice (November 1762) ended the protracted conflict, which was formally concluded by the Treaty of Hubertusburg (Feb. 16, 1763), acknowledging the status quo ante. Prussia retained Silesia.
