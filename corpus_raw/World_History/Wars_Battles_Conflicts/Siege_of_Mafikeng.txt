Siege of Mafikeng,  Boer siege of a British military outpost in the South African War at the town of Mafikeng (until 1980 spelled Mafeking) in northwestern South Africa in 1899â€“1900. The garrison, under the command of Col. Robert S. Baden-Powell, held out against the larger Boer force for 217 days until reinforcements could arrive. The rejoicing in British cities on news of the rescue produced the word mafficking, meaning wild rejoicing.
