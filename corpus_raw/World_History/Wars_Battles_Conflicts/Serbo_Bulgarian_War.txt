Serbo-Bulgarian War,   (Nov. 14, 1885–March 3, 1886), military conflict between Serbia and Bulgaria, which demonstrated the instability of the Balkan peace settlement imposed by the Congress of Berlin (Treaty of Berlin, July 1878).
Both Serbia and Bulgaria felt that the Treaty of Berlin should have awarded them more extensive territories at the Ottoman Empire’s expense. Under the Berlin settlement, Eastern Rumelia had been separated from the enlarged Bulgarian state created by the Treaty of San Stefano (March 1878) and had been returned to the Ottoman Empire. But on Sept. 18, 1885, Bulgarian nationalists in Eastern Rumelia mounted a coup and declared the province’s unification with Bulgaria. Serbia was opposed to this strengthening of its rival, Bulgaria. After the coup, the Serbian king, Milan Obrenović IV, who also hoped that an aggressive foreign policy would relieve his domestic problems, demanded that Bulgaria cede some of its territory to Serbia. In spite of active international diplomatic efforts to discourage him, Milan declared war on Bulgaria on Nov. 14, 1885. Although a swift Serbian victory was expected, Prince Alexander I of Bulgaria won the decisive battle at Slivnitsa (Nov. 17–19, 1885), defeating the invading Serbs and subsequently pursuing them back into Serbia. He accepted an armistice only when Austria-Hungary threatened to enter the war in Serbia’s defense.
The Treaty of Bucharest (March 3, 1886), which concluded the war, reestablished the prewar Serbo-Bulgarian border but left Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia united. Milan’s position was damaged beyond repair by the defeat; he abdicated in 1889, passing the Serbian crown to a regency in the name of his son Alexander.
