Battle of Mukden,  (20 February–10 March 1905), the climactic land battle at Mukden (Shenyang in northeast China)  of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05).  The battle was one of the largest fought before World War I, with more than half a million men engaged.
After the Russian defeat at Liaoyang, General Alexei Kuropatkin regrouped at Mukden, assembling an army of around 260,000. With their victory at the Battle of Port Arthur at the start of the new year, the Japanese were able to redeploy their Third Army to join Field Marshal Oyama Iwao’s advance, swelling his force to a similar size. With the entire land forces of Japan committed, Oyama set out to destroy the Russian army at Mukden.
The Russian defensive line was 90 miles (145 km) long, with troops dug into trenches behind barbed wire. Beginning on 20 February, The Japanese attempted to envelop the Russians, attacking both flanks, but took massive casualties to machine gun and artillery fire. The Japanese eventually made inroads on the Russian right, to which Kuropatkin responded by ordering troops across from the left on 7 March. However, the transfer of so many troops across such a large front caused chaos. Oyama was aware that Russian forces were preoccupied with this logistical challenge and ordered his forces to redouble their offensive. To escape envelopment, Kuropatkin was forced into a disorderly retreat, leaving behind his wounded and supplies.
With both sides exhausted, Mukden was the last land battle of the war. Popular discontent in Russia—to which news of the defeat at Mukden contributed—had brought the country to the brink of revolution. After a further defeat in the naval battle of Tsushima, the Russians made peace on Japan’s terms.
Losses: Russian, some 89,000 casualties of 333,000; Japanese, some 71,000 casualties of 270,000.
