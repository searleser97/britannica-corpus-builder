Messenian Wars,   (8th–7th century bc), contests between Sparta and Messenia in ancient Greece. Many modern historians believe that there were two early Messenian wars: the first (c. 735–c. 715) was the Spartan conquest of Messenia; the second (c. 660) was precipitated by a Messenian revolt over which the Spartans were ultimately successful. The complete conquest of Messenia by a land-hungry Sparta seems not to have ended until c. 600.
