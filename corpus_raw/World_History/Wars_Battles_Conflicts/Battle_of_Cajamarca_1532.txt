Battle of Cajamarca,  (15 November 1532). The noise and smoke of fire-flashing European weapons, as much as their deadly destructiveness, carried the day for the Spanish conquistadores at Cajamarca, Peru. Sheer shock made a nonsense of the numbers as Francisco Pizarro’s 128 invaders defeated the Inca army.
A complacent King Atahuallpa had allowed Pizarro’s expedition to pass unhindered into his realms. The Incas were observing a religious fast and decided that so negligible an enemy could wait. On 15 November 1532 the Incas finally confronted the Spaniards in the main square of Cajamarca, but Atahuallpa left the bulk of his 80,000-strong army outside the provincial city.
Pizarro’s "plan" appears to have been to improvise: trusting to the advantages of surprise and shock that the sight of horses, firearms, and iron weaponry and armor had given his compatriots wherever they went in the Americas. A nerve of steel also helped, however: Pizarro stayed calm as Atahuallpa and his staff came out to parley and dismissed with contempt his claim to have brought word of the true God. Handed a prayer book, the Inca king threw it down: Pizarro needed no further excuse to attack. His men opened fire and threw themselves upon the astonished Inca bodyguard. Blazing away with their muskets, slashing and thrusting with their swords, they slew 7,000 Incas; not a single Spaniard was badly hurt.
For all the power of their firearms, the conquistadores’ real secret weapon was their obliviousness toward the Inca people’s taboos: in physically laying hands on Atahuallpa and taking him prisoner, they did the unthinkable. The king was a god to his subjects; his humiliation turned Inca reality upside down. The Inca paid an enormous ransom in gold for the release of Atahuallpa, but Pizarro still had his prisoner garrotted in the end.
The Spanish were now allowed to occupy Atahuallpa’s empire unopposed.
Losses: Inca, 7,000; Spanish, none.
