Battle of Towton,  (March 29, 1461), battle fought on Palm Sunday near the village of Towton, about 10 miles (16 km) southwest of York, now in North Yorkshire, England. The largest and bloodiest battle of the Wars of the Roses, it secured the English throne for Edward IV against his Lancastrian opponents.
The Lancastrians had failed to seize London after their victory at the Second Battle of St. Albans on February 17, 1461, and were forced to retreat before the converging armies of Edward and Richard Neville, the earl of Warwick. The Yorkists swiftly pursued them, crossed the River Aire on March 28, and attacked the following day. The two sides had been battling for 10 hours in a raging snowstorm when the arrival of fresh troops under John Mowbray, 3rd duke of Norfolk, broke the Lancastriansâ€™ morale and dispersed their ranks. The fugitives were slaughtered mercilessly by the pursuing Yorkists. Although the estimates vary widely, the numbers engaged and the numbers killed were far greater than in any other battle of the Wars of the Roses.
