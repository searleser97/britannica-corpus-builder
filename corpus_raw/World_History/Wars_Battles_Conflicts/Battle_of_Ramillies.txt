Battle of Ramillies,  (May 23, 1706), victory won by Allied (Anglo-Dutch) forces led by the Duke of Marlborough over the French during the War of the Spanish Succession. The victory led to the Allied capture of the whole north and east of the Spanish Netherlands.
The battle was fought at the village of Ramillies, 13 miles north of Namur (in modern Belgium), between a 62,000-man Allied army under Marlborough and a 60,000-man French army under Fran√ßois de Neufville, Duke de Villeroi. Under express orders from Louis XIV to seek battle, the French reached the plain of Ramillies ahead of the Allies but deployed unwisely along the entire length of a 4-mile (6.5-kilometre) ridge, the centre of which was at the villages of Ramillies and Offus. A strong Allied attack on the French left forced Villeroi to shift reinforcements from his centre. Marlborough, however, called off this attack because the marshy ground would not permit cavalry support. Half of the battalions from this wing then marched, undetected by the French, to the centre to support the final concentrated Allied assault. This smashed the overextended French army. The French lost about 17,000 killed, wounded, or captured and by the next morning were thoroughly dispersed. Allied losses numbered about 5,000 killed and wounded. Although many towns fell to the Allies in the succeeding weeks, their advance came to a halt when they reached better-fortified and well-garrisoned towns farther south. The seemingly decisive victory did not lead to a peace settlement.
