Jingkang Incident,  (December 1126–January 1127).  In 1127 Jurchen steppe nomads captured the Chinese capital of Kaifeng and with it the Song emperor. This was a major event in Chinese political history, but it was also a turning point in military technology, being one of the earliest occasions on which gunpowder was used in battle.
A confederation of tribal horsemen, the Jurchen had developed imperial pretensions, declaring the foundation of the Jin dynasty in 1115. From 1125 they began a war against the Song dynasty, rulers of most of China. As so often in Chinese history, horsemen proved superior in open battle, but had difficulty taking walled cities.
The Siege of Kaifeng began in December 1126. The Song had been experimenting with gunpowder, placing it on the tips of arrows as an incendiary device and bundling quantities of it in bamboo or paper, tied up with string, to make a primitive bomb. Hurling these "thunderclap bombs" from the walls shocked the Jurchen—a Chinese source states that "many fled, howling with fright"—but the "bombs" were in truth no more than noisy firecrackers.
No relief army arrived to save the city, which fell to the Jurchen in mid-January 1127. There followed an orgy of looting and wanton destruction. The fate of the population was grim: the survivors were subjected to rape and other cruelties, or sold into slavery. The imperial family was not spared. Song Emperor Qinzong was carried off into the Jurchen heartland and lived out his days there with the status and dress of a servant. A new Song emperor was chosen to rule southern China, but the north was lost to the Jin dynasty, which ruled until the arrival of Genghis Khan’s Mongols in the thirteenth century.
