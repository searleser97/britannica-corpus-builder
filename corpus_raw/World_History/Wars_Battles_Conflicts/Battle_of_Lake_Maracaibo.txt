Battle of Lake Maracaibo,  also called the "Naval Battle of the Lake," (24 July 1823).  Here José Prudencio Padilla led the little fleet of Simón Bolívar’s Republic of Gran Colombia to victory over Ángel Laborde y Navarro’s superior Spanish squadron. Against unequal odds, his remarkable daring and tactical resource won the day, finally guaranteeing Venezuela’s independence.
Lake Maracaibo is something between a bay and a lake, with a narrow strait separating its sluggish waters from the sea. Here, at the start of July 1823, the Republican and Spanish fleets fought a few skirmishes before the former withdrew into the lake-port of Moporo for repairs and resupply. On the afternoon of 23 July Padilla received Laborde’s formal challenge: the Spanish fleet was lined up in battle formation close to Maracaibo’s western shore.
Spain’s hold on Venezuela had been uncertain since its dismal defeat at Carabobo two years before, but its continuing colonial presence had been assured by naval power. So it seemed set to continue, with Padilla, apparently eager to avoid a confrontation, steering for the safety of the mouth of the lake, in the east.
The following dawn he briefed his captains, but even then he did not give the order to weigh anchor until almost noon. As though making up for lost time, his fleet now sailed with startling swiftness into the attack. The well-armed Royalists opened up with their cannon first; the Republicans held their fire until, at point-blank range, they sent off a salvo to truly devastating effect. Closing fast, they quickly captured those vessels that had not been sunk in the opening bombardment. Only three succeeded in limping away after this savaging.
Losses: Unknown.
