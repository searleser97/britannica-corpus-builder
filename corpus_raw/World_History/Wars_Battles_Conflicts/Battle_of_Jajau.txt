Battle of Jajau,  (June 12, 1707), decisive engagement over succession to the Mughal throne of India following the death of the emperor Aurangzeb. It was fought at Jajau, a short distance south of Agra on the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Following the battle, the crown passed to Aurangzeb’s eldest surviving son, Bahādur Shah I.
After Aurangzeb’s death on March 3, 1707, Bahādur Shah, governor of Kabul (now in Afghanistan), and his next eldest brother, ʿAẓam Shah, vied for possession of the throne. Careful preparations and quick movements enabled Bahādur Shah to reach Agra on June 12 to secure the imperial treasure. Both sides numbered some 100,000 combatants, but Bahādur Shah had more artillery. This advantage, along with the desertion of part of ʿAẓam Shah’s army and a shortage of water in the intense heat, led to Bahādur Shah’s victory. Both ʿAẓam Shah and his son Bīdār Bakht were killed in the battle.
