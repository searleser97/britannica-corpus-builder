Battle of Kulikovo,  (Sept. 8, 1380), military engagement fought near the Don River in 1380, celebrated as the first victory for Russian forces over the Tatars of the Mongol Golden Horde since Russia was subjugated by Batu Khan in the thirteenth century.  It demonstrated the developing independence of the Russian lands from Mongol rule (which had been imposed in 1240) and was a giant step for the Duchy of Moscow in its rise to leadership of the Russian people.
Previously a backwater, Moscow grew in importance in the fourteenth century because its princes acted as agents of the Golden Horde, whose khans were overlords of the Russian lands. In the late 1370s, however, Dmitri, Prince of Moscow, took advantage of divisions among the Tatars to assert a measure of independence.
One claimant to leadership of the Golden Horde, Mamai, led an army to assert authority over Russia. Dmitri crossed the Don to face the Tatars. Chronicles narrate that the battle opened with a fight between champions from each side, both of whom were killed. Around noon a general engagement began. Dmitri cunningly exchanged his armor with one of his followers, who was duly sought out and killed by the Tatars. Dmitri escaped this fate, although he was wounded. After about three hours of fighting, a flanking charge by Russian cavalry forced the Tatars to withdraw. Although collapsing from loss of blood, Dmitri had his victory. He was accorded the name "Donskoy" to mark his triumph on the Don.
The result of the battle was decisive for Mamai, who lost the struggle for leadership of the Golden Horde. Russia had not gained freedom from Mongol domination, however, for the Horde’s new leader, Tokhtamysh, sacked Moscow two years later. But the Battle of Kulikovo did much to erase the memory of the Duchy of Moscow’s collaboration with the Mongols and established Dmitri Donskoy as a heroic figure in Russian history.
