Cherry Valley Raid,  (November 11, 1778), during the American Revolution, Iroquois Indian attack on a New York frontier settlement in direct retaliation for colonial assaults on two Indian villages. Earlier in the year the Americans had decided to increase military pressure against Britainâ€™s Indian allies in the West who had been intensifying their depredations of frontier settlements. In the fall a small American army annihilated the Indian villages of Oghwaga and Unadilla. Enraged, Iroquois chief Joseph Brant joined Tory captain Walter Butler in a surprise raid on Cherry Valley, New York, one of the few remaining fortified villages south of the Mohawk River. The town was destroyed; 30 of its defenders were killed and 71 wounded or captured before the invaders withdrew.
