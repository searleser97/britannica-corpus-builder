Capture of Cádiz,  (20 June–5 July 1596). The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 was a diplomatic and military disaster for Spain, but it only encouraged a rebuilding and strengthening of the fleet in order to restore Spanish maritime power. A second attempt to invade England in 1596 was met, as before, with a preemptive strike against the fleet in Cádiz.
Maritime rivalry between England and Spain intensified after 1588. An English counterarmada against Spain the following year proved to be a fiasco, while English attacks on Spanish treasure ships returning from the New World caused great controversy, although they often failed in their mission. It was, therefore, no surprise when Philip II of Spain ordered a second armada to invade England.
In response, a large English and Dutch fleet of around 120 ships left Plymouth on 3 June 1596, to scupper the Spanish plans. Once at Cádiz, the English destroyed two Spanish galleons and captured two more. The Earl of Essex, co-commander of the expedition, then led his men to storm the walls and occupy the city. Cádiz was ransacked, but the English failed to seize the rich merchant ships in the inner harbor, allowing the Spanish to scuttle them in time. Essex wanted to occupy and garrison the city permanently, but the other English commander, Lord Howard of Effingham—hero of the previous armada’s defeat—refused to agree because many of the English wanted to return home with their loot.
Leaving the city in flames, the English withdrew on  5 July. A success in terms of hurt Spanish pride, the raid failed to prevent the second armada setting sail four months later. However, once again, the weather intervened, and the Spanish fleet was forced home before it had reached its destination.
Losses: English, no ships of 120; Spanish, 2 ships sunk and  2 ships captured.
