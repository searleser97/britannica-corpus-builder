Battle of Plataea,  (July 479 bce). Following the Greek naval success at the Battle of Salamis in 480 bce, Persian King Xerxes left Greece with much of his army. However, his general, Mardonius, remained in northern Greece to continue the fight. The war’s deciding encounter at Plataea the next summer proved to be a crushing Greek victory.
Although Xerxes had returned to Asia and the Persian fleet had retreated to the eastern Aegean (and would be defeated there in 479 bce), Mardonius still had a vast army, substantially larger than the Greek alliance’s force. After initial maneuvers, Mardonius established a base at Plataea in the territory of Persia’s ally, Thebes. The Greek army, under the Spartan Pausanius, assembled on hills near the Persian camp to confront them.
At first, neither side wanted to make a full-scale attack, but the Persian cavalry successfully raided Greek supply routes and blocked some of the springs that provided their water supply. Pausanius therefore decided on a night move to a new position. This maneuver did not go as planned, and when dawn broke the Greek force was strung out and disorganized. Mardonius saw his opportunity and attacked. This offensive gave the Greeks the chance they needed. At close quarters their well-armed hoplite infantry gradually gained the upper hand. Mardonius himself was killed in action with the Spartans, and the leaderless Persians then broke and fled. As always in an ancient battle, the casualties of a routing army were horrific. Thousands of Persians were slaughtered on the retreat or in their camp; what was left of the Persian army withdrew north into Thessaly. Fighting between Greeks and Persians continued for many years, but the Persians never invaded Greece again.
Losses: Persian, 30,000 of 100,000; Greek, 2,000 of 40,000.
