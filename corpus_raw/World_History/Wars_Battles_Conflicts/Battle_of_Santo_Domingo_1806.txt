Battle of Santo Domingo,  (6 February 1806), British naval victory during the Napoleonic Wars.  Although unwilling after the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) to face Britain in a full-scale fleet battle, the French navy was still able to attempt raids on British commerce and against distant colonies, as it did in the Battle of Santo Domingo.  The British, nonetheless, won out in the end.
Much of the French fleet had been destroyed at Trafalgar and in its aftermath, but France’s Brest squadrons had taken no part in the campaign. At the end of 1805, two squadrons left Brest. One squadron, under Admiral Willaumez, returned home in the late summer of 1806 having taken losses and achieved little. By contrast, within days of setting out, Admiral Leissègues and his five ships of the line—one of them the exceptionally powerful 120-gun Impérial—were being pursued to the Caribbean by the British.
The British squadron was led by Admiral Duckworth, who annoyed his superiors by abandoning the blockade of Cádiz to take up the pursuit. The French had headed for the island of Santo Domingo, a Spanish colony then under French occupation. The British closed in on 6 February 1806, with seven ships of the line.
In the battle that followed, the British outfought and captured three of the French ships and then concentrated on Impérial and its remaining consort. They were forced ashore and wrecked. Much of the combat took place at close range in a pall of gun smoke; there were several collisions and examples of ships being hit by "friendly fire." Casualties on both sides were severe. If the British had failed to win this battle, Duckworth would have been in trouble; instead he was praised for saving Britain’s immensely valuable West Indies trade from a serious French attack.
Losses: British, 340 dead or wounded; French, 1,500 dead or wounded, 5 ships captured or destroyed.
