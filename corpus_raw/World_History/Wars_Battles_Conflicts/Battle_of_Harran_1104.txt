Battle of Harran,  (7 May 1104). The religious fervor of the First Crusade was over by 1104 as the new crusader lords attempted to secure their hold on the captured lands and to fend off further Muslim assaults. The defeat at Harran (in southeastern Turkey) was the first suffered by the crusader states and demonstrated the limits to Christian expansion.
An army of Seljuks under Sokman of Mardin and Jikirmish of Mosul lay siege to the city of Edessa. To distract the Seljuks, Prince Bohemond of Antioch and Count Baldwin of Edessa led an army to the city of Harran. The crusaders had not yet properly laid siege to Harran when the army of Sokman appeared. After a brief battle in sight of Harran, Sokman fell back to the south. Bohemond and Baldwin then gave chase. The retreat was probably merely a ruse to draw the crusaders away to allow Jikirmish to enter Harran with supplies and reinforcements.
On the third day of the retreat, Sokman halted just south of the River Balikh where he was joined by Jikirmish whose 7,000 cavalry remained out of sight of the crusaders. Baldwin and the Edessans formed the left of the crusader army and Bohemond with his Antioch troops were on the right. The battle opened with a general attack by Sokman, which was driven off. Sokman then fell back toward the waiting Jikirmish, luring Baldwin to follow him in disorder. Jikirmishâ€™s cavalry charged and inflicted heavy casualties, taking Baldwin prisoner.
Bohemond had not taken the bait and retreated in good order, although he lost men as he fought his way back to Edessa. Baldwin was freed in 1108 after paying a ransom and later became King of Jerusalem. However, the crusader state of Edessa never recovered its strength and in 1144 would become the first of the crusader states to fall to the Muslims.
Losses: Crusader, half of the 3,000 cavalry and 7,000 infantry; Muslim, 2,000 of 20,000.
