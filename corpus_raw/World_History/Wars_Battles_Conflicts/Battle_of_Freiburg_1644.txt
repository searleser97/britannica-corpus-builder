Battle of Freiburg,  (3, 5, and 9 August 1644). The struggle for the city of Freiburg in 1644 between French and Bavarian-imperial armies was one of the bloodiest and longest battles of the Thirty Years’ War. Although the French suffered heavier casualties, they forced a retreat and went on to gain mastery of the middle Rhine region.
Following the French victory at the Battle of Rocroi, preliminary peace talks had begun in 1643, but fighting carried on regardless. In the summer of 1644, the Bavarian-imperial armies—under Field Marshal Franz von Mercy—had gone on the offensive in the Rhine and taken the French stronghold of Freiburg (in present-day Germany) on 29 July. The commander of the French armies in Germany was Henri, Viscount of Turenne, an experienced soldier. Joining him to help retake Freiburg was Belgium’s Duke of Enghien. Together they commanded 20,000, outnumbering von Mercy by 3,500.
Von Mercy’s cavalry was in poor condition so he decided to conduct an infantry-based defense on the earthworks and wooded high ground around Freiburg. At 5:00 PM on 3 August, the French launched a frontal assault against the first line of von Mercy’s fortifications. The French ended the day in control of the field, but had taken heavy casualties. Von Mercy pulled his forces back and they were able to entrench their new positions on  4 August because the French were exhausted.
On 5 August the French attacked but they were again forced back at the cost of 4,000 killed or wounded. Von Mercy’s army was too tired to counterattack and Enghien called on reinforcements of 5,000. The French moved to attack Freiburg again on 9 August. Von Mercy, sensing the danger, withdrew and was able to retreat without any great losses under pressure from the French.
Losses: French, 7,000-8,000 of 25,000; Bavarian-Imperial, 2,500 of 16,500.
