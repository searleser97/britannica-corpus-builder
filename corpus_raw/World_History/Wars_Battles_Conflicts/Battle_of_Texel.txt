Battle of Texel,  (21 August 1673).  The last engagement of the Anglo-Dutch Wars, Texel demonstrated the indomitable fighting spirit of the Dutch navy led by Michiel de Ruyter, and the fiery temperament of seventeenth-century admirals, two of whom fought a personal duel.
After his attack on the allied English and French at Solebay, De Ruyter fell back on the defensive. The allies blockaded the Dutch coast but De Ruyter was in the safety of shallow home waters and mounted sorties to harass their blockading squadrons. Although outnumbered, the Dutch relied on a lack of cooperation between the French and English.
When De Ruyter sailed out from the Dutch island of Texel, French commander the Comte d’Estreés was probably under secret orders from Louis XIV to avoid losing ships and mostly kept out of the battle. The fighting between the Dutch and English was disrupted by a vendetta between English Admiral Sir Edward Spragge and Dutch Lieutenant Admiral Cornelis Tromp. Spragge had sworn to kill Tromp and pursued him without regard for battle formation. Having shattered one another’s flagships—and half their crew—in a savage exchange of fire, the two men shifted ship and repeated the devastation with a second pair of vessels. Finally, as Spragge took to a rowing boat to transfer to a third ship, the boat was cut in half by a cannonball and he drowned.
De Ruyter, meanwhile, pummeled the English before disengaging at will to return to the safety of the shallows. The storm of abuse heaped by the English upon the French in the wake of the battle heralded the end of  the Anglo-French alliance and of English participation in the war against the Dutch.
Losses: No ships lost on either side.
