Battle of Preston,  (17–19 August 1648).  In war, victors often fall out among themselves. Two years after the end of the English civil war, the victorious Parliamentary army took on its former allies, the Scots, at Preston. The battle was to become yet another famous victory for Parliamentary commander Oliver Cromwell.
After the Battle of Naseby in June 1645 and subsequent Parliamentary victories, Charles I surrendered to the Scots on 5 May 1646. He hoped to negotiate with them alone, splitting them from their Parliamentary allies. His plans did not work out, however, and in January 1647 the Scots handed over the king to Parliament in return for £400,000. Oliver Cromwell and the army offered the king a peace deal but he refused it, escaping to the Isle of Wight in November. There he concluded a deal with the Scots that would put him back on his throne.
The following July a Scottish army invaded England in the king’s support. Led by the Duke of Hamilton, it moved south through Lancashire, prompting Cromwell to head north from Wales to meet it. The two sides were ill-matched, the Scots having 18,000 men to Cromwell’s 8,600, but neither side could field artillery—Cromwell had marched too fast for his guns to keep up with his army. Crucially, the Scots were poorly equipped, commandeering horses on route to carry their ammunition, and their units straggled over more than 50 miles (80 km). On 17 August Cromwell pounced on the Scottish advance guard on the road into Preston and seized the town. The next day he attacked the rest of the Scottish army in hand-to-hand fighting, both sides relying on the skills of their pikemen. Totally outmaneuvered, the Scots fled, surrendering to Cromwell at Warrington on 19 August. The second civil war was now over.
Losses: Parliamentary, 100 of 8,600; Scottish, 2,000 dead, 9,000 captured of 18,000.
