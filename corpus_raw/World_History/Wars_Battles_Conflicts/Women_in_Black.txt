Women in Black,  international network of women who organize silent protests for peace and in opposition to war, violence, and militarism. With no central organization or official membership, the hundreds of Women in Black groups around the world are linked by a common form of protest—public vigils by groups of women dressed in black—and by a rough affinity of goals.
Women in Black began in Israel in January 1988, several months after the beginning of the first Palestinian intifadah, when a group of Israeli Jewish women began to hold silent protests in busy areas of Jerusalem in protest against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The women wore black and held placards with slogans such as “Stop the occupation.” Within months, more than 40 Women in Black groups had been formed throughout Israel; some of them were mixed groups of Israeli Jewish and Palestinian women. Since that time, Women in Black groups have been formed in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Belgium, Japan, Italy, and Spain. While some groups focus exclusively on issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, others protest violence and militarism in their own countries. International Women in Black conferences have been held around the world.
