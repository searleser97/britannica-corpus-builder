War of Devolution,  (1667–68), conflict between France and Spain over possession of the Spanish Netherlands (present-day Belgium and Luxembourg).
Devolution was a local custom governing the inheritance of land in certain provinces of the Spanish Netherlands, by which daughters of a first marriage were preferred to sons of subsequent marriages; and Louis XIV of France began the war on the pretext that this custom should apply to sovereign territories also, so that his wife, Marie-Thérèse, should succeed her father, Philip IV of Spain (d. 1665), in the majority of the Spanish possessions in the Netherlands in preference to her younger halfbrother, Charles II of Spain, a sickly epileptic unlikely to live long or produce heirs.
The French army under Marshal de Turenne advanced into Flanders in May 1667 and easily secured its objectives. Louis then turned to diplomacy and in January 1668 concluded a treaty with the Holy Roman emperor Leopold I whereby they agreed to partition the Spanish dominions between themselves on the Spanish king’s death and in which it was also stipulated how much territory in the meantime France was to annex in the Netherlands. The French had also tried to win English support for their claims, but a new ministry in England turned instead to an alliance with the Dutch and with Sweden. These allies sought to contain the French advance by persuading Spain to agree to moderate terms and by supporting Spain in war if this proved of no avail. The settlement envisaged was much the same as that on which Louis XIV and the emperor had agreed, and so peace was soon concluded at Aix-la-Chapelle in April 1668, though not before the Prince de Condé had overrun Franche-Comté with a French army. The latter province was returned to Spain, but France retained Bergues, Furnes, Armentières, Oudenaarde, Courtrai, Lille, Douai, Tournai, Binche, Ath, and Charleroi.
