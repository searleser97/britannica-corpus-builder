Battle of Guam,  (21 July–10 August 1944), World War II event. In attacking Guam, U.S. forces were not only acquiring a fine harbor and a number of airfields to use in future operations, but were also liberating U.S. territory—Guam had been captured by the Japanese in 1941. As elsewhere, Guam’s Japanese garrison fought practically to the last man. American casualties included some 1,700 dead and 6,000 wounded; Japanese deaths totaled some 18,000.
The attack on Guam was intended originally to start only days after the landings on Saipan, but it was postponed to the next month. The Americans used the delay well, however, to make the preliminary bombardment and air attacks extremely thorough and to ensure that offshore obstacles to landing craft were cleared efficiently. The landing force included both Marine and Army units from General Geiger’s III Amphibious Corps, in all 55,000 strong. General Takashina
 commanded 19,000 defenders, who had built a typically elaborate network of bunkers, artillery emplacements, and other fortifications. The landings began on 21 July on the west coast of the island. They were soon established solidly ashore despite a series of fierce night attacks by the Japanese over the first few days of the battle. It took a week for the Americans to link their two beachheads, but by then much of the Japanese strength had been dissipated and Takashina himself had been killed. The surviving Japanese units fought on for another two weeks, gradually retiring toward the north end of the island, before organized resistance largely ended. Even then Guam’s particularly mountainous terrain helped a few diehards to hold out. Some small units fought on until after the end of the war, causing occasional U.S. casualties, and one solitary veteran only emerged from the jungle to surrender and return to Japan in 1972.
