War of the Emboabas,  (1708–09), conflict in the Captaincy of Minas Gerais, Brazil, between the original settlers from São Paulo (Paulistas) and new settlers called emboabas, who were mostly European immigrants. In the late 17th century the Paulistas had opened gold mines in Minas Gerais and soon came into conflict with the emboabas, whom they considered trespassers. In the ensuing civil war the colonial government supported the successful emboabas. The Paulistas then moved to Mato Grosso, to the west, where in 1718 they discovered new gold deposits.
