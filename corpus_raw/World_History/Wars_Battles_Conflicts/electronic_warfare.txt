Electronic warfare,  any strategic use of the electromagnetic spectrum, or of tactics related to the use of the electromagnetic spectrum, against an enemy in a military conflict.
The most commonly practiced types of electronic warfare are jamming, which falls under the category of electronic countermeasures (ECM), and eavesdropping on enemy communications, which is known as signals intelligence (SIGINT) gathering. The purpose of jamming is to limit an enemyâ€™s ability to exchange information by overriding radio transmissions or by sending signals to prevent radar detection or convey false information. Intelligence gathering has grown more significant in direct relation to the increased technical complexity of modern warfare and now plays an important role in determining whether states go to war in the first place.
The strategic response to ECM is electronic protective measures, also known as electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM), the purpose of which is to undermine enemy attempts to deny use of the electromagnetic spectrum. A common method is to quickly switch frequency channels according to a prescribed pattern, known only to the transmitter and the receiver. This technique is known as frequency-hopping spread spectrum.
A counterpart to SIGINT gathering is known as electronic support measures (ESM) to gain intelligence about the enemy. The information gained from electronic support measures may be used as the basis for ECM or ECCM, as well as for threat recognition, avoidance, targeting, and homing.
