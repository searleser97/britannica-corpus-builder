Battle of Dresden,  (Aug. 26–27, 1813), Napoleon’s last major victory in Germany. It was fought on the outskirts of the Saxon capital of Dresden, between Napoleon’s 120,000 troops and 170,000 Austrians, Prussians, and Russians under Prince Karl Philipp Schwarzenberg.
The allies had hoped to capture Dresden, Napoleon’s major base of operations and supply depot. On August 23 Napoleon learned that the Dresden garrison of fewer than 20,000 men—commanded by Laurent Gouvion-Saint-Cyr—was threatened by the allied advance, and he rushed reinforcements there. In one of history’s great marches, the Imperial Guard covered 90 miles (145 km) in three days, and two corps of conscripts covered 120 miles (190 km) in four days, giving Napoleon 70,000 troops on the first day of the battle and 120,000 on the second. Meanwhile, Gouvion-Saint-Cyr constructed many fortifications.
On August 26 Schwarzenberg attacked in a great semicircle around the city, his flanking troops resting on the Elbe River. Gouvion-Saint-Cyr’s defenders yielded ground slowly, at great cost to the attackers. Napoleon arrived and in the late afternoon drove the allies back to their original positions. On the morning of the 27th he took the offensive. The superior mobility of his artillery decided the issue, when rain and mud made it almost impossible for infantry or cavalry to function effectively. The allies were forced to retire, with losses of 38,000 to French losses of 10,000. Napoleon became ill, and the pursuit of the allies was left to the corps commanders. They were seriously beaten, on August 30 and September 6, negating the value of the victory at Dresden.
