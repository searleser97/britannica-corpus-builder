Northern Expedition,  (1926â€“27) campaign of the Chinese Nationalist army (then allied with the communists) that advanced north from Guangzhou (Canton) to the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) battling warlord forces. The Northern Expedition was aided by Soviet arms and advisers and by a propaganda corps that preceded them. After defeating the warlords, the Nationalist army turned on Britain as the chief imperialist power and primary enemy. In response, the British returned their concessions in Hankou and Jiujiang but prepared to defend Shanghai. The alliance between the communists and the Nationalists fell apart at that point: when communist-led labour unions captured Shanghai for Chiang Kai-shek, he attacked and suppressed them, and when he set up his new government in Nanjing he expelled the communists from it.
