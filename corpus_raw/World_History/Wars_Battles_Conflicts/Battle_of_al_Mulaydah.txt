Battle of Al-Mulaydah,  (1891), decisive victory for Ibn Rashīd, the ruler of the Rashīdī kingdom at Ḥāʾil, near Jabal Shammar in Najd, northern Arabia, who defeated allies of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, the head of the Wahhābī (fundamentalist Islamic) state in Najd. The battle marked the end of the second Wahhābī empire.
The Wahhābī prince ʿAbd Allāh lost many of the territories that his father, Fayṣal (reigned 1834–65), had acquired by conquest following the collapse of the first Wahhābī empire (1818). In 1885 ʿAbd Allāh was “invited” to Ḥāʾil to be the “guest” of Ibn Rashīd, the dominant figure in Arabian politics at the time, while a representative of Ibn Rashīd was appointed governor of Riyadh, the Wahhābī capital.
Although ʿAbd Allāh was restored to the Wahhābī throne in 1889, he died the same year, and his youngest brother, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, soon became embroiled in hostilities with Ibn Rashīd and assembled against him an alliance of tribes in Al-Qaṣīm. Ibn Rashīd promptly marched on Riyadh but, unable to take it, stationed himself in al-Mulaydah, on the edge of the Al-Dahnāʾ desert, where he engaged and defeated the rebellious tribesmen of Al-Qaṣīm in 1891. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, having missed the battle, fled Riyadh with most of his family and after some difficulty was able to take refuge in Kuwait. Ibn Rashīd, meanwhile, annexed the Wahhābī realm to his own empire.
