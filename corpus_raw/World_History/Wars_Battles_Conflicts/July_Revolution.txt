July Revolution, French Révolution de Juillet, also called July Days,  (1830), insurrection that brought Louis-Philippe to the throne of France. The revolution was precipitated by Charles X’s publication (July 26) of restrictive ordinances contrary to the spirit of the Charter of 1814. Protests and demonstrations were followed by three days of fighting (July 27–29), the abdication of Charles X (August 2), and the proclamation of Louis-Philippe as “king of the French” (August 9). In the July Revolution the upper middle class, or bourgeoisie, secured a political and social ascendancy that was to characterize the period known as the July Monarchy (1830–48). See also 1830, revolutions of.
