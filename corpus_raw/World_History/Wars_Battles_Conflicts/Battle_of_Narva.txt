Battle of Narva,  (30 November 1700). In 1700, Czar Peter I of Russia challenged the long-established Swedish domination of the Baltic in alliance with Denmark and Saxony-Poland-Lithuania. In November that year, the Swedish triumphed over the Russians in their first major engagement of the Great Northern War at Narva, Estonia.
After the Russians declared war on Sweden, they invaded Estonia and besieged Narva in September 1700. By November 1700, the Swedish king, Charles XII, had already forced Denmark out of the war. He then transported his army to Estonia to face his remaining enemies. The SaxonPolish-Lithuanian army had just withdrawn for the winter. This left the way clear for the Swedish army to relieve Narva by surprising the Russian army, which was more than four times its size.
Crucially, the Swedish forces were well led and highly disciplined, whereas the Russians were comparatively poorly trained and often ineffectively led by foreign officers. Czar Peter had been leading his armies personally—but, shortly before the Swedish arrival, he had returned to Russia, leaving an experienced general, Charles Eugène de Croy, in command.
The Swedish army approached Narva on 30 November and quickly took advantage of a snowstorm that blew into the face of the Russian army. The Swedes attacked in two columns of foot and horse, too rapidly for the Russians to deploy their artillery. After a fierce struggle, the Russian cavalry on the left flank fled, and then their infantry on the right flank retreated. The remaining Russians surrendered, and Croy was also captured. Narva had rid Sweden of any immediate Russian threat on its Baltic territory, but Charles XII was unable to follow up his victory with a decisive blow into Russia.
Losses: Swedish, 2,000 of 8,000–11,000; Russian, 8,000–10,000 of 24,000–35,000.
