Battle of Magdeburg,  (November 1630–20 May 1631). After defeat at Dessau and Denmark’s withdrawal, the Protestants had received a boost when Sweden invaded Germany in 1630, but they could not prevent the imperial army’s sack of Magdeburg, the most infamous episode of the Thirty Years’ War.
Magdeburg had been under a loose imperial blockade, commanded by Count Pappenheim, since November 1630. Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden had given Magdeburg assurances of protection, and when Count Tilly led a substantial army to besiege it in earnest on 3 April, Gustavus Adolphus moved to protect the city. He had sent one of his officers, Dietrich von Falkenburg, to command the defense. Tilly had a powerful siege train and carefully picked off the outworks one by one.
By 1 May, Tilly had taken all of Magdeburg’s outer defenses. Two days later the suburbs fell and the city was reduced to its inner defenses. Gustavus Adolphus was unable to reach Magdeburg as local rulers were unwilling to allow him to march through their territories. Although desperate, Magdeburg still refused to surrender. On 20 May at 7:00 AM, Tilly launched his final charge. Within two hours his infantry had breached the inner defenses, followed by heavy cavalry. During the attack, fires broke out across the city, and imperial soldiers began to massacre the citizenry and loot the city. Tilly, unable to control his men, lost all of the supplies he had hoped to gain. By day’s end, 20,000 of Magdeburg’s inhabitants had been killed—the single greatest tragedy of the war.
Losses: Protestant, 20,000 defenders and civilians of 25,000; Imperial, 300 dead and 1,600 wounded of 25,000.
