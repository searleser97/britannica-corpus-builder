Battle of Carthage,  (146 bce). The destruction of Carthage was an act of Roman aggression prompted as much by motives of revenge for earlier wars as by greed for the rich farming lands around the city. The Carthaginian defeat was total and absolute, instilling fear and horror into Rome’s enemies and allies.
Under the treaty ending the Second Punic War, signed after the Battle of Zama, Carthage had to seek Roman permission before waging war. That treaty expired in 151 bce, so when Rome’s ally Numidia annexed land from Carthage, a Carthaginian army marched to defend it. Rome declared this event to be an act of war and laid siege to Carthage.
The Roman army, led by Manius Manlius, made little impact as the Carthaginians raised an army, converted the city into an arms factory, and held out. About 140,000 of Carthage’s women and children were evacuated by sea to seek refuge in friendly states. In 147 bce, the Roman senate sent a new commander, Scipio Aemilianus, with orders to take the city by storm. He defeated the Carthaginian field army and built a mole to block the city’s harbor. The end came in the spring of 146 bce after the besiegers made a breach in the city walls. The Roman soldiers poured in, only to find that each street had been barricaded and every house fortified. The Romans had to clear the houses one by one.
By the eighth day, the last pockets of Carthaginian resistance collapsed. Last to fall was the Temple of Eshmun, where the wife of the Carthaginian commander, Hasdrubal, sacrificed her sons in front of the Romans, then killed herself. Scipio ordered the city to be burned, then demolished.
Losses: Carthaginian, 62,000 dead and 50,000 enslaved of 112,000 present in the city; Roman, 17,000 of 40,000.
