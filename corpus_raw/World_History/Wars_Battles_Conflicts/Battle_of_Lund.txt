Battle of Lund,  (4 December 1676).  After their naval triumph at Öland, a Danish  army was able to cross into Scania in southern Sweden. At Lund, in the bloodiest battle of the Scanian War and one of the bloodiest ever fought in Europe, Charles XI of Sweden led his army to a decisive victory over Christian V of Denmark’s invading army.
Danish troops had been able to overrun most of Scania during summer 1676. In October, Charles XI led an army of 12,000 into Scania to retake the province; by December, disease and hunger had cut its numbers by nearly half. The Danish army, which included experienced German mercenaries, was well rested and well equipped and had taken up a position near the town of Lund. When a cold snap froze the nearby Lödde River, Charles XI launched a daring, surprise night attack on the Danish army. This attack failed, and the Swedish center and left were locked in a desperate struggle with the Danes across the treacherous frozen ground around Lund.
Meanwhile, Charles XI had launched a successful cavalry charge on the right wing, which broke the Danish left. In its pursuit, it had reached as far as the Danish camp, and it took an hour and a half to rally and return to the main battlefield. There the Swedish center and left had been pinned back by the superior Danish infantry and artillery. Just as it appeared that the Danes were close to victory, Charles XI’s cavalry swept through them from the rear, completely devastating the Danish horse, who quickly abandoned the foot soldiers. The Danes who remained on the field were slaughtered until the Swedish offered quarter to any who laid down their arms.
Losses: Swedish, 2,300-3,000 of 6,500; Danish, 6,000 of 12,300.
