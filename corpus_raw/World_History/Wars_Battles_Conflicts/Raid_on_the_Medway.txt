Raid on the Medway,  (12–14 June 1667).  The Dutch raid on the dockyards in the Medway in 1667 was one of the deepest humiliations ever visited upon England and the Royal Navy. Although the material losses inflicted were grave, even more painful was the public proof that the English were powerless to defend their own coastline.
Since the Second Anglo-Dutch War began in 1665, England had suffered a string of misfortunes, including the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London. King Charles II was broke and had no money to pay sailors or dockworkers. England was seeking peace desperately, but the Dutch government leader, Johann de Witt, wanted a crushing victory so he could impose punitive terms. His brother, Cornelis de Witt, was given command of a fleet that first sailed to the mouth of the Thames and then shifted southward, taking Sheerness on the Medway and sailing inland toward the  dockyard at Chatham.
The English blocked the navigable channel with a chain stretched from shore to shore, but Dutch engineers made short work of this obstacle. Beyond the chain, English ships with skeleton crews lay defenseless. Three "great ships"—the largest naval vessels—were scuttled hastily; a fourth, Royal Charles, was seized by the Dutch. The only resistance came from shore batteries. Nonetheless, De Witt and his captains were nervous, hardly believing the ease of their success, and on 14 June they withdrew, taking Royal Charles with them as a trophy. The other ships they had captured were burned.
The shock of the action was great. Diarist Samuel Pepys, then secretary to the admiralty, thought the monarchy would fall. In fact, peace was made with limited advantage to the Dutch. England’s desire for revenge helped motivate another Anglo-Dutch War the following decade.
Losses: English, 13 ships; Dutch, no ships.
