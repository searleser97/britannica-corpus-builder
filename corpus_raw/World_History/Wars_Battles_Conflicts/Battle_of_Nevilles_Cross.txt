Battle of Neville’s Cross,  (Oct. 17, 1346), English victory over the Scots—under David II—who, as allies of the French, had invaded England in an attempt to distract Edward III from the Siege of Calais (France). Edward, however, had foreseen the invasion and left a strong force in the northern shires. The battle took place near Durham and resulted in a decisive defeat for the Scots. David was captured, southern Scotland was occupied, and the English were able to pursue the French war. David remained a prisoner of the English until 1357.
