Battle of Tewkesbury,  (May 4, 1471), in the English Wars of the Roses, the Yorkist king Edward IV’s final victory over his Lancastrian opponents. Edward, who had displaced the Lancastrian Henry VI in 1461, later quarreled with his powerful subject Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and Warwick in 1470 restored Henry to the throne. In March 1471 Edward returned from Holland, defeating and killing Warwick at the Battle of Barnet on April 14. On that day King Henry’s queen, Margaret of Anjou, who had been in France with her son Prince Edward since 1462, landed at Weymouth, in Dorset, and moved northward to rally Lancastrian support in Wales. King Edward intercepted her army just south of Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire on May 3. Battle was joined the following day, each side numbering about 3,000 men. The Lancastrians had a strong defensive position, but a surprise Lancastrian attack on the Yorkist left miscarried, and the Yorkists broke the main Lancastrian position. About 1,000 men were killed, including Prince Edward and other Lancastrian leaders. The murder of Henry VI in the Tower of London (May 21–22) secured Edward’s position.
