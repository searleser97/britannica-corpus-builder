Water Witch incident,  (1855), brief military skirmish near the Paraguayan Ft. Itapirú, involving the USS “Water Witch,” commanded by Lt. Thomas J. Page, and Paraguayan troops who fired as the vessel was exploring the Paraná River, in international waters.
In 1853 the “Water Witch” set out on a scientific study, organized by the U.S. government, of the Río de La Plata waterways. In 1854, after Page became involved in a controversy between the Paraguayan president Carlos Antonio López and a North American firm, Paraguay barred foreign war vessels from its waters. In the subsequent incident in 1855 on the Paraná River, one U.S. seaman was killed and several others were injured, and gunfire from the “Water Witch” killed a number of Paraguayan troops.
In 1859 the U.S. government dispatched a naval force to Paraguay to force a settlement of its claims involving the “Water Witch” incident and earlier disputes. The settlement included a formal apology to the U.S. government for the attack and an agreement by the Paraguayan government to pay the slain seaman’s family an indemnity of $10,000.
