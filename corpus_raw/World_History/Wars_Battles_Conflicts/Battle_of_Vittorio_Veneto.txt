Battle of Vittorio Veneto,  (24 Oct–4 Nov 1918), decisive Italian victory and the final offensive launched on the Italian Front during World War I.  This Italian assault coincided with the internal political breakup of the multinational Hapsburg Empire. The defeat of the Austro-Hungarian army consigned the centuries-old empire to the pages of history and dramatically changed the political map of central Europe.
Under political pressure to act before the Austro-Hungarians secured armistice arrangements with U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, Italian commander-in-chief General Armando Diaz launched a major offensive across the Piave River and north against the strongpoint of Mt. Grappa. With the Piave in flood, Diaz first attacked Mt. Grappa on 24 October. Three days of heavy fighting brought little gain against a stubborn defense.
Able to bridge the Piave late on 26 October, Diaz opened the second phase of the operation. On 29 October the Austro-Hungarian line along the river began to crack. The breakdown of the defense coincided with declarations of independence from the provisional Czechoslovak government in Prague and the Hungarian dissolution of their union with Austria.
Short of equipment, rations, and manpower, the Austro-Hungarian army was no longer a coherent fighting force. Some units simply abandoned their positions and began marching home to their new nation states. From 30 October the Italian advance was slowed only by its rapidly growing number of prisoners. On 3 November an armistice was signed, to come into effect on the 4th. The Austro-Hungarian command ordered its men to cease hostilities after the signing, but the Italians continued their advance, taking many more prisoners and reaching the Isonzo River without opposition.
Losses: Italian, 40,000 casualties; Austro-Hungarian, 30,000–80,000 casualties and some 450,000 captured.
