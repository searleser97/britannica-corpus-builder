Hong Kyŏng-nae Rebellion,  peasant uprising in northern Korea in 1812 organized by Hong Kyŏng-nae, a fallen yangban (court official), in response to oppressive taxation and forced labour during a time of famine caused by crop failure. The rebels prevailed for several months and were put down only after a concerted military campaign. A similar rebellion occurred in the 1860s.
