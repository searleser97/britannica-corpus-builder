Siege of Antwerp,  (28 September–10 October 1914).  The German capture of the Belgian city of Antwerp in World War I showed the weakness of fortifications in the face of the latest German heavy artillery. But the siege also revealed the Belgians’ refusal to bow to German demands and their determination to carry on fighting on the Allied side.
After the German invasion of Belgium, most of the Belgian army fell back to the fortress city of Antwerp. Although the German First Army had bypassed it in favor of the advance across Belgium and into France, the Belgian troops in the city were a thorn in the German side. When it became clear that a great victory over France had eluded Germany at the Battle of the Marne, General Helmuth von Moltke redeployed his forces to eliminate this nuisance. General Hans von Beseler’s III Reserve Corps—chosen to attack Antwerp—contained only five understrength divisions, but had been reinforced with 173 heavy artillery pieces. These included the super-heavy howitzers that had proved so effective against Liège and Namur.
On 28 September, German artillery began to systematically engage and destroy the outer forts that protected Antwerp. The British, fearful that the loss of Antwerp might be the first step in the conquest of the Channel ports, agreed to the Belgian request for reinforcements and began to land naval infantry, with the promise that the newly formed 7th Division would follow.
As the Germans closed in, the Belgian commanders decided to abandon the city. On 7 October, before the British 7th Division had even set off, the Belgians transferred their forces from Antwerp to Ostend to continue the fight in open terrain. Two days later, German troops entered the city; the siege was over.
Losses: Allied, 30,000 casualties (mainly captured) of 150,000; German, unknown of 66,000.
