Siege of Pondicherry,  (21 Aug–18 Oct 1778), engagement in the Anglo-French War.  The outbreak of war between Britain and France over French support for the rebel United States of America had repercussions in India. The hostilities provided a convenient opportunity for the British to make inroads into the remaining French  possessions in the Indian subcontinent, which had their capital at Pondicherry.
The British were commanded by General Hector Munro and the French garrison at Pondicherry was commanded by Guillaume Leonard de Bellecombe, its governor. Bellecombe set about improving Pondicherry’s defenses. Gun batteries were moved close to the shore to counter a move by the Royal Navy, and the French garrison was swelled by French troops who had retreated following the fall of Karikal on 10 August.
General Munro besieged Pondicherry on 21 August, and this was followed by a series of naval encounters that resulted in the French ships withdrawing to the south. The British brought up batteries to begin bombarding the fortress in September and launched a first assault soon after. However, the British took heavy losses and withdrew to settle in for a long siege. Throughout September the French launched a number of sorties to sabotage the British artillery under the cover of nightfall, with mixed success. In one sortie, on 4 October, Bellecombe was injured and had to withdraw, whereupon the British increased the ferocity of their bombardment, leveling parts of the south and northwest bastions. With an allout assault looking imminent, Bellecombe, who was ill from his injury, surrendered on 18 October. As a tribute to their sixty days of resistance, Munro allowed Bellecombe’s force to march out of the fort with full military colors.
Losses: British, 200 casualties of 1,500 regulars, 800 casualties of 7,000 sepoys; France, 300 casualties of 800 regulars, 150 casualties of 500 sepoys.
