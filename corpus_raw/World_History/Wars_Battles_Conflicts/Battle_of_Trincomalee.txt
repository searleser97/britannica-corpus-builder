Battle of Trincomalee,  (3 September 1782), savage naval battle of the Anglo-French War (1778–83) fought off the coast of Trincomalee, northeastern Sri Lanka, famous throughout history as one of the finest ports in the world.
The battle was one of several French efforts to counter British expansion in India and the last in a series of fiercely fought engagements between France’s skillful naval commander Admiral Pierre André de Suffren de Saint-Tropez and British Admiral Sir Edward Hughes. The French captured Trincomalee from the British on September 1 when Suffren seized the anchorage and forced the garrison to surrender. Two days later, Hughes approached the port, and Suffren ordered his ships to raise anchor and engage the British fleet.
The battle was brutal. Suffren, aboard his flagship Heros, moved into the center of the British squadron, supported by two ships, and engaged Hughes’s flagship, the seventy-four-gun Superb. Hughes had the support of three other ships of the line but took heavy damage from the French. Suffren was forced to withdraw when his mainmast broke and his ammunition ran out. However, at either end of the British formation, French ships were causing havoc, disabling the sixty-four-gun Exeter and killing her captain. The battle continued for several hours, and the French, assisted by a favorable wind, were able to inflict serious damage on the British ships. In the end, darkness forced the two fleets to withdraw. The British limped back to Madras while the French returned to Trincomalee to effect repairs. Although the Royal Navy lost no ships, the damage was so severe that Madras effectively had no naval cover and troops were brought in just in case the French decided to launch an invasion.
Losses: British, 320 casualties, severe damage to all 12 ships; French, 350 casualties, severe damage to most  of the 14 ships.
