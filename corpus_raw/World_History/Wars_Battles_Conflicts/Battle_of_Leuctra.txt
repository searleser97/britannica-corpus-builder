Battle of Leuctra,  (6 July 371 bce).  Fought in Boeotia, Greece, the Battle of Leuctra made Thebes the leading military power among the Greek city-states, ending the long dominance of Sparta. The battle also marked a revolutionary advance in battlefield tactics and demonstrated the effectiveness of homosexuality as a form of bonding for elite troops.
Thebes defied the Spartans by leading a league of Boeotian city-states that Sparta was determined to suppress. A force of Spartan and other Peloponnesian troops was thus sent to attack Thebes, which hastily prepared to defend itself with its Boeotian League allies. Although the Thebans were outnumbered and their allies were unreliable, Theban general Epaminondas persuaded his colleagues that they should give battle on the plain at Leuctra.
Thebes was strong in cavalry but its infantry phalanx looked certain to lose against the experienced Spartans. Epaminondas improvised a major departure from Greek military convention. Traditionally the armored hoplite phalanx fought in a block twelve deep, with the best troops in the place of honor on the right. But Epaminondas packed his hoplites on the left of his line in a column about fifty deep, fronted by the Theban Sacred Band, an elite body of 150 homosexual couples. The center and right of his line, weak and depleted, he held back from contact with the Spartan phalanx, screened by skirmishers and horsemen. Advancing obliquely to the attack, the Thebans delivered a crushing blow to the Spartan right, smashing it apart with heavy losses. The rest of the Peloponnesian forces, exposed to attack from the flank, put up little resistance. Sparta suffered above all a blow to its prestige, which encouraged allies and subject states to drift away from its orbit.
Losses: Theban, 300 of 8,500; Spartan,1,000 of 12,000.
