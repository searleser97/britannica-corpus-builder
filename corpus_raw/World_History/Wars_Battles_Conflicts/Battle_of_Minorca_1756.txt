Battle of Minorca,  (20 May 1756).  By 1756, an Anglo-French conflict—the French and Indian War—had already begun in North America, without a declaration of war. This spread to Europe and became part of the Seven Years’ War, of which this conflict at Minorca (the Spanish Balearic island in the western Mediterranean Sea) was the first sea battle. France’s victory at Minorca was only a brief setback to Britain’s maritime superiority, but it led to the execution of Britain’s Admiral John Byng.
After naval clashes in their undeclared war in 1755, France prepared an expeditionary force at its main Mediterranean base of Toulon. Britain was slow to respond, initially concentrating its mobilization in the Atlantic and off North America. A British fleet, under the command of Admiral John Byng, was sent to block whatever maneuver the French might attempt from Toulon, but the French struck first, landing troops on the island of Minorca—an important British base—and besieging Port Mahon, its main port.
Byng reached Minorca with his fleet of twelve ships of the line on 20 May 1756 and found a French fleet, also of twelve ships (although rather more heavily armed), under the Marquis de la Galissonière, ready to oppose him. Byng attacked straight away, but his approach to the French line went badly wrong and only a few of his ships engaged the enemy. A limited and unimaginative commander, he failed to maneuver his fleet to remedy this initial blunder. After an indecisive battle, he decided to give up any attempt to relieve Minorca and sailed back to Gibraltar. Port Mahon fell a few days later.
Opinion in Britain was one of outrage. Byng was tried for neglect of his duty to do his utmost to engage the enemy. Of this he was undoubtedly guilty, but the charge carried a mandatory death sentence. Appeals for clemency failed, and he was executed by firing squad on the deck of a ship at Portsmouth a year later.
Losses: Fewer than 200 dead and wounded on each side; no ships lost.
