Battle of Poson,  (863), attack launched by Byzantine forces against the Arab armies of ʿUmar, the emir of Melitene (now Malatya, Tur.), ending with an Arab defeat and paving the way for Byzantine conquests in the late 10th century.
ʿUmar marched his army up the Black Sea coast to the Byzantine port of Amisus (now Samsun, Tur.), which he took and sacked. On his return, he was met by the Byzantine general Petronas and a large army near Poson, west of the Halys River (now Kızıl River). A fierce engagement took place on September 3, in which the Arab army was surrounded and annihilated and in which ʿUmar himself was killed. Petronas’ victory marked a turning point in the Byzantine struggle with the Arabs.
