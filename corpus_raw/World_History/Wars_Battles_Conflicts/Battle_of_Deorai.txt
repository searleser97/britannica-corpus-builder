Battle of Deorai,  (April 12–14, 1659), victory of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb that confirmed his possession of the throne. It was fought at Deorai, in northeastern India, by Aurangzeb and his brother against rival prince Dārā Shikōh.
Dārā challenged Aurangzeb, relying on the promised support of Jaswant Singh of Marwar. However, Jaswant then deserted him, and Dārā was left to face Aurangzeb’s superior army alone. Defeated after three days’ resistance, he was captured and later executed.
