Battle of Cuzco,  (May 1536–March 1537). Manco Inca, son of Atahuallpa, brought a force of 400,000 warriors with him when he launched his assault on Cuzco early in 1536. Holed up in the Inca capital, the Spanish conquistadores resorted to desperate measures, but still succeeded in withstanding a ten-month siege, thereby solidifying their hold on Peru.
The Inca had paid an enormous ransom in gold for the release of Atahuallpa—their king and god—after their loss at the Battle of Cajamarca (1532), but the conquistador leader, Francisco Pizarro, still had his prisoner garrotted in the end. Manco took his place as Inca ruler. At first content to be a puppet ruler, Manco rebelled when he realized how little authority he would have. Taking refuge in the Yucay Valley, he raised an army: warriors flocked there from all corners of Peru, and from Inca realms in Ecuador and Chile. Although Pizarro’s troops had been reinforced by fresh arrivals in the years since he had taken the Inca Empire with just 128 men, the Spanish were still overwhelmingly outnumbered.
In May 1536, the Inca were ready for revenge and attacked. They took the Spanish by surprise and managed to occupy most of the city. Crucially, they took the formidable citadel of Sacsahuaman. The conquistadores were forced to mount their own countersiege. Meanwhile, cut off from all support, they sent out parties to seek help from New Spain (Mexico). These excursions were intercepted, their members killed or captured. Manco set these Spanish prisoners to instruct his Inca warriors in the use of horses, swords, and guns. However, after months of fighting, the Spanish succeeded in cutting off supplies to Sacsahuaman: they then sallied forth to attack Manco’s headquarters at Ollantaytambo. This attack was repelled but, as Manco moved in upon Cuzco for the kill, his own force was taken by surprise. The Inca were defeated, and the reign of the Spanish over Peru was confirmed.
Losses: Unknown.
