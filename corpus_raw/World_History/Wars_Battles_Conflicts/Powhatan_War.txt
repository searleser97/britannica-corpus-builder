Powhatan War,   (1622–44), relentless struggle between the Powhatan Indian confederacy and early English settlers in the tidewater section of Virginia and southern Maryland. The conflict resulted in the destruction of the Indian power. English colonists who had settled in Jamestown (1607) were at first strongly motivated by their need of native corn (maize) to keep peace with the Powhatans, who inhabited more than 100 surrounding villages. The emphasis on cooperation was strengthened by the efforts of the Powhatan chief Powhatan and his daughter Pocahontas.
By the time of Powhatan’s death (1618), settlers had discovered the highly profitable tobacco crop and were pressing increasingly into Indian territory for rich new land to cultivate. In resistance to this incursion, the confederacy’s new chief, Opechancanough, Powhatan’s elderly brother, in 1622 led his people in a sudden attack against colonists throughout the area, massacring 347 of a total of about 1,200. Intermittent warfare followed for 14 years; an uneasy calm was shattered in 1644 with a final Indian uprising in which 500 whites were slain. Determined British opposition, aided by Christianized Indians, broke the power of the warring confederacy the same year, and Opechancanough was killed.
