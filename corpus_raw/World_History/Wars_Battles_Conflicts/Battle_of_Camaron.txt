Battle of Camarón,  (30 April 1863).  A defensive action fought with suicidal courage during France’s ill-fated intervention in Mexico, the Battle of Camarón founded the legend of the French Foreign Legion. Captain Jean Danjou, who led the legionnaires, enjoys the strange distinction of having his wooden hand revered as a relic of war.
Almost a year after their setback at Puebla in 1862, the French expeditionary force in Mexico resumed its push toward Mexico City. Puebla was placed under siege. Danjou was ordered to protect a valuable supply convoy heading for Puebla from Veracruz. With sixty-two men and two lieutenants under his command, he encountered some 3,000 Mexican cavalry and infantry.
Danjou was a battle-hardened veteran who had lost a hand fighting rebels in Algeria. He held off the Mexican cavalry by forming his men into an infantry square, before falling back to a strong defensive position in "Hacienda Camarón," a high-walled inn. The situation was hopeless, but Danjou refused to surrender. His legionnaires swore to fight to the death. Barricaded in the hacienda, they cut down wave after wave of Mexican infantry with disciplined fire. At around midday Danjou was shot in the chest and killed. Resistance continued for another four hours and the number of dead and wounded mounted until only six men were left fighting—Lieutenant Maudet and five legionnaires. Still refusing to surrender, this remnant fixed bayonets and charged the Mexican line. Two survived to be taken prisoner, and their request for an honorable surrender was granted by the Mexicans.
Every subsequent year, the Legion would bring out Danjou’s wooden hand for veneration on the anniversary of the Battle of Camarón; the hand is still viewable at the Legion Museum of Memory at Aubagne, near Marseilles. France abandoned its fruitless Mexican adventure in 1866.
Losses: French, 43 dead, 20 wounded of 65; Mexican, 90 dead and several hundred wounded of 3,000.
