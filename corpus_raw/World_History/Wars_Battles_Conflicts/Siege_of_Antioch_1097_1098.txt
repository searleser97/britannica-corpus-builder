Siege of Antioch,  (20 October 1097–28 June 1098). This marked the arrival of the First Crusade in the Holy Land. Events set a pattern of betrayal, massacre, and heroism that was to mark future campaigns. By capturing Antioch, the crusaders secured lines of supply and reinforcement to the west.
Having marched through the Seljuk lands, the crusaders captured Edessa and arrived at the huge city of Antioch on 20 October 1097. Bohemond of Taranto, Raymond of Toulouse, and Godfrey de Bouillon each commanded a section of the blockading lines. The Turkish garrison was commanded by Yaghi Siyan, who summoned a relief army from Damascus and another from Aleppo, only for both to be defeated by the crusaders before they reached Antioch.
Sometime during the winter, Bohemond made contact inside the city with a Christian soldier named Firouz, who had command of the Gate of Two Sisters. On 2 June, Firouz opened the gate, allowing the crusaders to enter and join the Christian inhabitants in a massacre of the Turks. Yaghi Siyan was killed but his son Shams held out in the citadel. Two days later a huge Turkish army led by Kerbogha of Mosul arrived and laid siege to the crusaders inside Antioch. On 10 June, a monk named Peter Bartholmew had a vision of where the Holy Lance was hidden; when found, it boosted crusader morale.
On 28 June, the crusaders marched out to do battle with the Holy Lance as their standard. The crusader knights charged, scattering the lightly armed Turkish cavalry. At this point many of Kerbogha’s allies deserted him and the Turkish army disintegrated. Bohemond rushed back into Antioch to take the surrender of Shams, occupy the citadel, and announce that he was now Prince Bohemond of Antioch.
Losses: Crusader, 2,000 of 30,000; Turkish, 10,000 of 75,000.
