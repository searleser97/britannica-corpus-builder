Siege of Sardis,  (546 bce). The defeat of King Croesus of Lydia by Persian ruler Cyrus II at Sardis was a major step forward in the rise of the Persian Empire. The victory was achieved against heavy odds through Cyrus’s calm resourcefulness, the discipline of his men, and a remarkable use of camels as both a martial and an olfactory deterrent.
Cyrus II belonged to the Achaemenid dynasty, claiming descent from the mythical hero Achaemenes. As of the mid-sixth century bce, his house no longer had the illustrious empire that its lineage warranted, but Cyrus set out to change this. In 550 bce, the king of the Persians encouraged the neighboring Medes to rise up against Astyages, their ruler. When he then invaded their land, he was greeted as a liberator. Croesus, ruler of Lydia, in modern-day Turkey, was Astyages’ brother-in-law. He marched into Media to avenge Astyages, but Cyrus’s soldiers defeated him at the Battle of Pteria.
Pursuing the fleeing Lydians into the heart of their own country, the Persians found themselves outnumbered when Croesus called up all his reserves. Famous for his wealth, the Lydian ruler could marshal impressive forces, reportedly just over 100,000 to the Persians’ 50,000. Cyrus formed his army into a vast defensive square, surrounded by the camels from his baggage train. The onrushing Lydian cavalry fanned out as though to enfold the square in a classic encircling movement, but soon realized that they had spread themselves too thin. Worse, their horses shied away in panic at the strange sight and smell of the Persian camels, an effect that Cyrus had noticed earlier at Pteria. Croesus’s army broke and scattered; the king withdrew to his capital Sardis, but it was taken by the Persians after a two-week siege.
Losses: Unknown.
