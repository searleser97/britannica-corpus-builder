Battle of Pamplona,  (20 May 1521). The Battle of Pamplona was part of the war between France and the Hapsburgs from 1521 to 1526. Spain had conquered part of Navarre in 1512, but in 1521 it rebelled with French backing. The Navarrese captured Pamplona by defeating the Spanish garrison, which included Ignatius of Loyola, who subsequently founded the Jesuits.
Navarre had straddled the Pyrenees until Spain conquered the Iberian part of the kingdom in 1512. Henry d’Albret—the son of the last king of Navarre before the Spanish annexation—was eager to reclaim his lands. When war between France and Spain started in 1521, Henry crossed the Pyrenees with a strong French army. This ignited revolt across Spanish Navarre.
The most important position was Pamplona, the capital of Navarre. When the town rose up, with assistance from the French army, the Spanish governor wanted to surrender immediately. Loyola—a Basque soldier who had more than a decade of military experience—opposed this, arguing that the garrison should attempt to hold out. The Spanish retreated to the citadel of the fortress, where a Franco-Navarrese force besieged their position. On 20 May, after a six-hour bombardment, a cannon ball severely wounded Loyola as he patrolled the ramparts. It passed through his legs, wounding one and shattering the other. Shortly afterward, the defenders surrendered and Pamplona was lost.
Loyola was allowed to return home. During his convalescence, he underwent a religious conversion and gave up his military career for a religious life, eventually founding the Jesuit order and becoming Saint Ignatius of Loyola. Spain was able to reverse its setback after Pamplona and recapture the southern part of Navarre that year, with the kingdom north of the Pyrenees only enduring as a French client state.
Losses: Unknown.
