Battle of Bosworth Field,  (August 22, 1485), battle in the English Wars of the Roses, fought 12 miles (19 km) west of Leicester and 3 miles (5 km) south of Market Bosworth, between the forces of the Yorkist king Richard III and the Lancastrian contender for the crown, Henry Tudor (the future Henry VII). It was in effect the last battle of the Wars of the Roses, and it established the Tudor dynasty on the English throne.
Henry, returning from exile, landed at Milford Haven (August 7) and marched toward Richard at Leicester. Early on August 22 Richard’s army reached a superior position on Ambien Hill. Richard’s ally, John Howard, duke of Norfolk, was killed in the initial skirmish. Though called to the area by the king, Thomas, Lord Stanley (later 1st earl of Derby), and Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, failed to assist the Yorkists in battle. When Richard moved against Henry Tudor, Sir William Stanley, brother of Lord Stanley who had privately pledged support for Henry, attacked Richard’s flank. The Yorkist army melted away, while Richard, preferring death, was unhorsed and killed in the bog.
