Second Battle of the Somme, also called Battle of Saint-Quentin,  (March 21–April 5, 1918), partially successful German offensive against Allied forces on the Western Front during the later part of World War I.
The German commander, General Erich Ludendorff, believed that it was essential for Germany to use the troops freed from the Eastern Front by the collapse of Russia to achieve a victory on the Western Front in the spring of 1918, before American troops arrived in sufficient numbers to effectively reinforce the war-weary Allies. His first offensive was directed against the rather weak British armies north of the Somme River, between Arras and La Fère. The British trenches were shelled and gassed before a massive morning attack in dense fog, which took the British by surprise. Their first and second lines quickly fell, and by March 22 the shattered British 5th Army was in retreat and had lost contact with the French to the south. The Germans moved rapidly forward, hoping to drive a permanent wedge between the French and the British, but by March 28, the Allies had assembled new troops that checked the German advance east of Amiens. The German offensive had obtained the single largest territorial gain on the Western Front since the early months of the war in late 1914. The Germans had advanced almost 40 miles (64 km) and had taken about 70,000 prisoners, but in spite of these gains the Allied lines were only bent, not broken. The German tactical virtuosity, unconnected to any broader strategic concept, only exhausted Germany’s limited resources.
