Battle of Monterrey,  (20–24 September 1846), an engagement of the Mexican-American War.  On 13 May the United States declared war on Mexico. Unaware of this, on 18 May Major General Zachary Taylor crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico, after defeating the Mexicans at Palo Alto and the next day at Resca de la Palma. He occupied Matamoros and halted there awaiting orders.
News of Taylor’s victories brought untrained volunteer units to join the army. These were shipped to join Taylor, raising his army to more than 6,200 men. When his proposed campaign against Monterrey was approved, Taylor organized the army into three divisions and marched, arriving north of Monterrey on 19 September.
The town was protected by forts, several on prominent nearby hills, and defended by more than 5,000 Mexican regulars led by Major General Pedro de Ampudia. On 20 September, after a reconnaissance, Brigadier General William Worth’s division was sent around west to cut the road to Saltillo and to capture Federation Hill and Independence Hill, while the other divisions attacked on the east. On the morning of the 21 September, a cavalry attack on Worth was repulsed, and his troops successfully seized the two fortifications on Federation Hill. In the east, Taylor’s advance suffered under heavy fire but succeeded in capturing a fortified bridge and two earthworks, then pushed into town before withdrawing for the night. After dark, a detachment climbed Independence Hill for a surprise attack that captured its two positions.
No skirmishes occurred on the following day, though on 23 September, U.S. forces attacked on the east and west of Monterrey in a bitter house-to-house, urban battle. Cannon were brought into the streets to blast holes through house walls. The next day, at Ampudia’s request, Taylor negotiated a surrender of the town, allowing Mexican forces to withdraw and an eight-week armistice.
Losses: U.S., 120 dead, 368 wounded, 43 missing; Mexican, 430 dead, wounded, or missing.
