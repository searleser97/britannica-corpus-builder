Indochina wars,  20th-century conflicts in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, with the principal involvement of France (1946–54) and later the United States (beginning in the 1950s). The wars are often called the French Indochina War and the Vietnam War (q.v.), or the First and Second Indochina wars. The latter conflict ended in April 1975.
In the latter half of the 19th century, Vietnam was gradually conquered by the French, who controlled it as a protectorate (1883–1939) and then as a possession (1939–45). Vietnamese rule did not return to the country until Sept. 2, 1945, when the Nationalist leader Ho Chi Minh proclaimed its independence. From 1946 to 1954, the French opposed independence, and Ho Chi Minh led guerrilla warfare against them in the first Indochina War that ended in the Vietnamese victory at Dien Bien Phu on May 7, 1954. An agreement was signed at Geneva on July 21, 1954, providing for a temporary division of the country, at the 17th parallel of latitude, between a communist-dominated north and a U.S.-supported south. Activities of procommunist rebels in South Vietnam led to heavy U.S. intervention in the mid-1960s and the Second Indochina War, or Vietnam War, which caused great destruction and loss of life. It came to a brief halt in 1973, when a cease-fire agreement was signed (January 27) and the remaining U.S. troops in South Vietnam began to be withdrawn. The war was soon resumed. In 1975 the South Vietnamese government collapsed and was replaced (April 30) by a regime dominated by the communists. On July 2, 1976, the two Vietnams were reunited as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
Cambodia had been a French protectorate since 1863 and achieved independence in 1953 under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Sihanouk adopted a position of neutrality in the Vietnam conflict and tacitly permitted Vietnamese communists to use sanctuaries inside Cambodia. On March 18, 1970, however, he was deposed in a coup by right-wing elements in the armed forces. On May 1, 1970, U.S. and South Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in an effort to destroy communist sanctuaries along the Cambodia-Vietnam border. Cambodia’s new leaders by then faced a growing threat from Cambodian communists called the Khmer Rouge (“Red Khmers”). The U.S. launched a series of intensive bombing raids of rural areas of Cambodia until 1973 in an effort to disrupt Khmer Rouge activities; but, after a five-year civil war, the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, fell to the Khmer Rouge on April 17, 1975. Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in January 1979 and installed a puppet government soon afterward.
Laos had been a French protectorate since the turn of the century. It achieved independence in a series of steps between 1946 and 1954. Control of the government changed hands between rightists and neutralists several times until 1962, when a coalition government between them and the Laotian communists called the Pathet Lao (“Lao Country”) was formed under the leadership of Prince Souvanna Phouma. The coalition continued to govern while communists and noncommunists vied for control of the outlying provinces of the country. After the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, the Pathet Lao, supported by the North Vietnamese, established control over the whole of Laos.
