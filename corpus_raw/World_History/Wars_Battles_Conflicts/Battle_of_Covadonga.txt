Battle of Covadonga,  (c. 720). Covadonga was a small-scale clash between Islamic Moors and a force of Christians from Asturias in northern Spain—led by their king, Don Pelayo. It guaranteed the survival of a Christian foothold in Iberia and is sometimes described as the start of the "Reconquista"—the reconquest of Spain from the Muslims.
When Don Pelayo was elected king of Asturias around 718, he drew upon the climate of ill feeling among his subjects toward the Moors and instigated a rebellion, refusing to pay tribute. Rather than a single engagement, Covadonga can be seen as the final act in a series of rebellions starting in 718 and lasting for two to three years. During this time Pelayo had successfully repulsed attempts by the Moors to reassert control in Asturias.
However, in 720, a large force was sent to Asturias to deal with the problem and, after a series of minor defeats, Pelayo was forced to retreat into the mountains. Here he formed a defensive position in a gorge flanked by steep sides. Pelayo’s force was probably fewer than 500 men, but the terrain meant that a large frontal attack was impossible. On arrival, Al-Kama, the Moorish leader, sent surrender terms to Pelayo, who refused to accept them.
Al-Kama ordered his attack and sent his elite troops into the gorge. The Asturians fired arrows from both sides of the gorge inflicting terrible casualties on the Moors, who were then pushed back by a sudden counterattack led  by Pelayo. As the Moors retreated, they were attacked by the Asturians, whose numbers were suddenly swelled by villagers who saw that victory might be possible.
Victory at Covadonga and the subsequent rout of the retreating Moors secured the independence of Asturias. This ensured that one small part of Iberia remained under Christian control.
Losses: Unknown.
