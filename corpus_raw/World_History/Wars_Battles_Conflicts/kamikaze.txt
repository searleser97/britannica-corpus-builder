Kamikaze,  any of the Japanese pilots who in World War II made deliberate suicidal crashes into enemy targets, usually ships. The term also denotes the aircraft used in such attacks. The practice was most prevalent from theBattle of Leyte Gulf, October 1944, to the end of the war. The word kamikaze means “divine wind,” a reference to a typhoon that fortuitously dispersed a Mongol invasion fleet threatening Japan from the west in 1281. Most kamikaze planes were ordinary fighters or light bombers, usually loaded with bombs and extra gasoline tanks before being flown deliberately to crash into their targets.
A piloted missile was developed for kamikaze use that was given the nickname “Baka” by the Allies from the Japanese word for fool. The pilot had no means of getting out once the missile was fastened to the aircraft that would launch it. Dropped usually from an altitude of over 25,000 feet (7,500 metres) and more than 50 miles (80 km) from its target, the missile would glide to about 3 miles (5 km) from its target before the pilot turned on its three rocket engines, accelerating the craft to more than 600 miles per hour (960 km per hour) in its final dive. The explosive charge built into the nose weighed more than a ton.
 Kamikaze attacks sank 34 ships and damaged hundreds of others during the war. At Okinawa they inflicted the greatest losses ever suffered by the U.S. Navy in a single battle, killing almost 5,000 men. Usually the most successful defense against kamikaze attack was to station picket destroyers around capital ships and direct the destroyers’ antiaircraft batteries against the kamikazes as they approached the larger vessels.
