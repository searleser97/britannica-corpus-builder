Battle of Marignano,  (Sept. 13–14, 1515), French victory over a Swiss army in the first Italian campaign of Francis I of France. Fought near the village of Marignano (modern Melegnano), 10 miles (16 km) southeast of Milan, the battle resulted in the French recovery of Milan and in the conclusion of the peace treaty of Geneva (Nov. 7, 1515) between France and the Swiss Confederation. It was a classic clash between Swiss shock infantry—halberdiers and pikemen—and French artillery and heavy cavalry. The French won, though only by a narrow margin, despite a heavy numerical advantage.
Determined to conquer the duchy of Milan, Francis I allied himself with Venice and crossed the Alps via the previously unexploited route Col de l’Argentière (Col de Larche; Maddalena). The French forces seized Novara and proceeded toward Milan, which was defended by its Swiss allies. On September 13 the Swiss advanced against the French position near Marignano and attacked across the marshy ground separating the armies but withdrew somewhat by midnight. The next day, after eight hours of inconclusive fighting, the French were reinforced by Venetian cavalry and forced the Swiss to retreat.
