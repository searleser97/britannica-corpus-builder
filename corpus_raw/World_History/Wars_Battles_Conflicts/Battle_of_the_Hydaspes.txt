Battle of the Hydaspes,  (326 bce), fourth and last pitched battle fought by Alexander the Great during his campaign of conquest in Asia. The fight on the banks of the Hydaspes River in India was the closest Alexander the Great came to defeat. His feared Companion cavalry was unable to subdue fully the courageous King Porus. Hydaspes marked the limit of Alexander’s career of conquest; he died before he could launch another campaign.
After conquering the Persian Empire, Alexander decided to probe into northern India. King Porus of Paurava blocked Alexander’s advance at a ford on the Hydaspes River (now the Jhelum) in the Punjab. The forces were numerically quite evenly balanced, although Alexander had more cavalry and Porus fielded 200 war elephants.
Alexander divided his army, leaving a small force with Craterus facing Porus on the ford while taking most of the army to cross a second ford 17 miles (27 km) away. When Porus learned that Alexander had advanced over the river, he marched to attack. Porus put his cavalry on the flanks and infantry in the center, with the elephants in front. Alexander posted his heavy infantry in a phalanx in the center, led the right wing cavalry himself, and sent the left wing cavalry under Coenus on a wide, outflanking ride behind a hill.
In the center, the Macedonian phalanx was almost broken by the charging elephants, but eventually drove them off, only to face the Indian infantry. Alexander attacked on the right, but failed to find a gap to exploit with his horsemen. When Coenus returned to the battlefield at the rear of the Indians, Alexander was able to defeat the Indian cavalry and encircle the infantry. Porus reformed his infantry into a defensive block and then offered to surrender if granted generous terms. Alexander agreed Porus could remain king of Paurava but imposed tribute.
Losses: Macedonian, 1,000 of 41,000; Indian, 12,000 dead and 9,000 captured of 50,000.
