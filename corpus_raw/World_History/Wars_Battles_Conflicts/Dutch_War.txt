Dutch War, also called Franco-dutch War,   (1672–78), the second war of conquest by Louis XIV of France, whose chief aim in the conflict was to establish French possession of the Spanish Netherlands after having forced the Dutch Republic’s acquiescence. The Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672–74) formed part of this general war.
After having signed (1670) the secret Treaty of Dover with England against the Dutch, Louis mounted an invasion of the Dutch Republic in May 1672 that was supported by the British navy. The French were able to quickly occupy three of the seven Dutch provinces, but then the Dutch opened the dikes around Amsterdam, flooding a large area, and their army, under William III of Orange, rallied behind this “Water Line.” By autumn William had begun land operations against the French invaders. Meanwhile, the Dutch navy, under Admiral M.A. de Ruyter, managed to stave off attacking English and French fleets in battles off Sole Bay in 1672 and off Ostend and Kijkduin in 1673, each time frustrating an invasion of the republic. England then made peace with the Dutch in the Treaty of Westminster of February 1674. In 1673 Spain, the Holy Roman emperor, and Lorraine took the side of the Dutch against France, and so by the end of 1673 the French had been driven out of the Dutch Republic.
But from 1674 to 1678 the French armies, with Sweden as their only effective ally, managed to advance steadily in the southern (Spanish) Netherlands and along the Rhine, defeating the badly coordinated forces of the Grand Alliance with regularity. Eventually the heavy financial burdens of the war, along with the imminent prospect of England’s reentry into the conflict on the side of the Dutch, convinced Louis to make peace despite his advantageous military position. The resulting Treaties of Nijmegen (1678–79) between France and the Grand Alliance left the Dutch Republic intact and France generously aggrandized in the Spanish Netherlands.
