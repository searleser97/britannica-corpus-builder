Battle of Flodden,  (Sept. 9, 1513), English victory over the Scots, fought near Branxton, Northumberland.  Ever anxious to protect themselves against their old enemy, the English, the Scots formed an alliance with France in 1295. The Auld Alliance, as it was known, proved to have disastrous consequences when, in 1513, James IV invaded England on Aug. 22, 1513, in support of his French ally.
In 1513, King Henry VIII of England declared war on  France and invaded the country. King James IV of Scotland then promptly declared war on his old enemy and headed south in an attempt to divert Henryâ€™s attention away from France. Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, hurriedly raised an English army and headed north to meet the Scots.
The two sides met at Flodden in Northumbria in what became the largest battle that the two nations ever fought against each other. The Scottish army drew itself up on a hill and prepared to fight a defensive battle. Surrey responded by boldly moving his entire army around to the back of the Scots, forcing them to reverse their positions. Surrey covered his move with a longrange artillery bombardment and archery volleys from the English longbowmen. Thoroughly unsettled by this bombardment, the impatient Scottish pikemen charged down the hill. A violent melee then took place, the English infantry mainly armed with bills-a curved blade on the end of a long pole-gradually repulsing repeated Scottish assaults. By the time the battle ended that evening, some 10,000 Scots lay dead, including James IV and most of his leading nobles.
Militarily the battle is very important, and has been described as the last great medieval battle that took place in the British Isles. This was the last time the longbow played a decisive role in battle, and the first time artillery proved crucial in Britain.
Losses: English, 1,500 of 26,000; Scottish, 10,000 of 30,000.
