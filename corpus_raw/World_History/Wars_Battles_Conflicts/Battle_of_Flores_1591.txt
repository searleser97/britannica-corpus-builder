Battle of Flores,  (30-31 August 1591). The battle between Spain and England off Flores Island in the Azores was a Spanish victory, showing the resurgence of Spain’s naval power after the debacle of the 1588 armada. For the English, the heroic fight put up by Richard Grenville’s Revenge became a national legend,  commemorated in Tennyson’s poem "The Revenge."
Led by Thomas Howard, an English squadron sailed to the Azores in the mid-Atlantic, hoping to intercept the annual Spanish treasure fleet laden with silver and gold from the Americas. For months they waited for the treasure ships in vain, their crews progressively depleted by disease. Meanwhile, Spain organized a powerful fleet, under Alonso de Bazan, to attack Howard’s squadron.
The English were taking on water at Flores Island when the Spanish arrived on 30 August. Although Bazan tried to trap them with a pincer movement, all of the English ships slipped away except one. Lagging behind, Grenville’s Revenge was rammed by a Spanish galleon and surrounded by enemy warships. Grenville was a fighting man with a fearsome reputation—arrogant, brutal, and intransigent—and his ship was credited as the finest galleon in the English navy. Without a thought of surrender, he fought off Spanish boarding parties and kept his men firing, taking on five enemy ships simultaneously and succeeding in sinking one of them. The battle lasted fifteen hours. On the morning of 31 August, with further resistance impossible, Grenville gave the order to blow up his shattered ship rather than surrender. His crew refused to obey. Gravely wounded in the head, Grenville had the chagrin of seeing his ship taken over by the Spanish before he died of his injuries. The Spanish never succeeded in taking Revenge home as a prize; the ship sank in an Atlantic storm within a fortnight.
Losses: English, 1 ship captured; Spanish, 1 ship sunk.
