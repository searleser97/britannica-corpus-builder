Battle of Nineveh,   (612 bce). Determined to end Assyrian dominance in Mesopotamia, Babylonia led an alliance in an attack against the Assyrian capital, Nineveh. The city was comprehensively sacked after a three-month siege, and Assyrian King Sinsharushkin was killed. Although his successors clung to power for a while, the days of Assyrian ascendancy were gone.
In the early centuries of the second millennium bce, Babylon had been the dominant power in Mesopotamia and the Middle East. Since then, the city had been increasingly marginalized. Its pride remained, and it had several times attempted to rise up against Assyrian domination, but it had never been close to succeeding. In 626 bce, however, a new king, Nabopolassar, sensed that the hold of Assyria’s rulers was weakening.
It took Nabopolassar ten years to expel Assyrian forces from Babylonia itself, and in 616 bce he led an invasion of Assyria. By then, other discontent peoples were eager to enlist in the Babylonian cause, including several from what is now Iran. Soon, Nabopolassar was heading an army that included the people of Susa—a city-state in the foothills of the Zagros mountains—and the Scythians, mounted nomads (and formidable cavalrymen) from the steppe. The Medes, a people from the plains of northwestern Iran, marched south to take the Assyrians’ original home city of Assur in 614 bce, after which they too struck an alliance with Nabopolassar.
Together, under Babylonian leadership, the allies moved against the Assyrian capital, Nineveh. Resistance was fierce, and it was three long months of fighting before it fell. The city was sacked, and Assyria’s King Sinsharushkin killed. Even then, the Assyrians rallied around a new, would-be ruler, Ashuruballit, but he was finally defeated in 608 bce.
Losses: Unknown.
