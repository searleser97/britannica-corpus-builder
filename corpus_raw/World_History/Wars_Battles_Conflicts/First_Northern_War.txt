First Northern War,  (1655–60), final stage of the struggle over the Polish-Swedish succession. In 1655 the Swedish king Charles X Gustav declared war on Poland on the pretext that Poland’s John II Casimir Vasa had refused to acknowledge him; the real reason was Charles’s desire to aggrandize more Baltic territories. The Swedes, allied with Brandenburg, invaded Poland with initial success; but then Russia, Denmark, and Austria declared war on Sweden, and Brandenburg deserted the Swedes to join the coalition. The Swedes were driven from Poland but twice invaded Denmark. The war ended with the Polish sovereigns renouncing their claim to the Swedish throne and the Swedes acquiring Skåne from Denmark.
