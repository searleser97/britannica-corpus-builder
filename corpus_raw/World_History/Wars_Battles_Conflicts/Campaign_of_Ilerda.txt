Campaign of Ilerda,  (49 bc), the campaign leading to the victory of Julius Caesar over Pompey’s forces in Spain. In the spring of 49 bc, Caesar sent six legions from Gaul into Spain under Gaius Fabius and joined them at Ilerda (present-day Lérida) on the Sicoris (Segre) River. Five Pompeian legions, together with many Spanish auxiliaries, commanded by Lucius Afranius and Marcus Petreius, were concentrated against Caesar. After Caesar failed to provoke Afranius to battle and became short of supplies because of floods, he diverted part of the river just below Ilerda to make a ford near his camp. This move forced the Pompeians to move two legions over the Sicoris to cover their communications. Afranius, no longer at an advantage, retired toward the Ebro. Caesar pursued him, and, after a week of maneuvering, the Pompeians had to surrender. With Spain conquered and Gaul and Italy in his control, Caesar could afford to face Pompey in Greece; there Caesar prevailed in the Battle of Pharsalus (48 bc).
