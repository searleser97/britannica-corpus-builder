Battle of Benevento,  (26 February 1266). This battle was the result of the long-running power struggle in Italy, between the Guelfs (supporters of the papacy) and the Ghibellines (supporters of the Holy Roman Empire). The defeat of Manfred of Sicily marked a triumph for the papacy and all but destroyed the Hohenstaufen dynasty.
Having usurped the throne of Sicily (which ruled much of southern Italy) from his infant nephew, Manfred—son of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen—quickly and ruthlessly established his authority over his realm, allying himself with Muslim Saracens at Lucera in southern Italy. However, he faced the undying hostility of a series of short-lived popes, who sought a challenger whom they could recognize and support. Eventually Charles of Anjou, brother of Louis I of France, was invited to Rome, crowned by the pope as the true king of Sicily, and—with the help of Genoese and Florentine bankers—raised an army of Italian Guelfs and French mercenaries.
Manfred took up a strong position on the plain of Grandella, near Benevento. As the French infantry advanced, he unleashed his Saracen archers and light cavalry, and the French were scattered. But the Saracens left themselves exposed to the French heavy cavalry and were, in turn, overwhelmed. To regain the advantage, Manfred ordered his own heavy cavalry, mostly German mercenaries, into the attack. Initially they seemed to be succeeding, but they were seriously outnumbered and began to take heavy losses.
The role played by Manfred’s Italian cavalry is disputed: either they attempted a flanking attack and were quickly beaten, or they were so appalled at the butchery of the Germans that they fled the field without a fight. Either way, it was clear to Manfred that all was lost, and he rode into the thick of the fighting to meet his death.
Losses: Unknown.
