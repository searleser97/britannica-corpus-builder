King William’s War,   (1689–97), North American extension of the War of the Grand Alliance, waged by William III of Great Britain and the League of Augsburg against France under Louis XIV. Canadian and New England colonists divided in support of their mother countries and, together with their respective Indian allies, assumed primary responsibility for their own defense. The British, led by Sir William Phips, captured Port Royal, Acadia (later Nova Scotia), but failed to take Quebec. The French and Indians under the Count de Frontenac carried out successful attacks on Schenectady, N.Y., Salmon Falls (in present New Hampshire), and Casco Bay (in present Maine) but failed against their main target—Boston. The protracted war ended with the Treaty of Rijswijk (1697). Because of the importance of Indian participation, it is also known as the first of the four French and Indian Wars.
