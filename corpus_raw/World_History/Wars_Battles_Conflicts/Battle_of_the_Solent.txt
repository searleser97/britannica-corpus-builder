Battle of the Solent,  (19â€“20 July 1545). In 1543 Henry VIII of England declared war on France and seized Boulogne. In response, Francis I prepared a fleet to invade England. The opposing naval forces met off the English coast in a tentative encounter that deterred a French invasion but is chiefly remembered for the sinking of the Mary Rose.
As the French assembled their fleet of 150 sailing ships in Le Havre, joined by twenty-five galleys brought from the Mediterranean, the English under Admiral John Dudley launched a largely fruitless preemptive strike. His fleet returned to Portsmouth for essential repairs but was far from ready when the French fleet crossed the Channel to the Sussex coast and then sailed west to the mouth of the Solent, between Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight off the southcentral coast of England. On the fine, still morning of 19 July, the French galleys entered the Solent in sight of Henry VIII, who was reviewing his fleet in Portsmouth. The English fleet set sail, taking advantage of a freshening breeze to approach the galleys. One ship, the large but elderly Mary Rose, fired her starboard guns at the galleys and then turned to prepare to fire her port side guns. As she did so, she floundered, either as a result of enemy gunfire or more probably as a result of a sudden gust of wind that caused her to keel over and submerge her open starboard gun ports. As the sea poured in, the ship quickly sank, killing all but thirty of its 415 crew.
The French failed to capitalize on this disaster. Both fleets exchanged long-range cannon fire the next day, and some French soldiers went ashore briefly on the Isle of Wight. While the English tried to salvage their sunken ship, the French headed home across the Channel.
Losses: English, 1 ship of 80; French, no ships of 175.
