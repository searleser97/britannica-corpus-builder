Pig War,  tariff conflict from March 1906 to June 1909 between Serbia and Austria-Hungary, so named because during it the export of live Serbian pigs to Austria-Hungary was prohibited. In 1903 Serbia, regenerated with the accession of a new king that year, threatened Austria-Hungary in the Balkans, and the Austro-Serb commercial treaty was running out. Renewal negotiations foundered, for Serbia wanted to reduce its economic dependence on Austria, which took 80 to 90 percent of all exports and supplied 50 to 60 percent of all imports. In January 1904 Serbia placed a munitions order with a French firm rather than the usual Austrian one, and a Serbo-Bulgarian customs union (Aug. 4, 1905) ruined the trade negotiations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. On March 1, 1906, the “Pig War” started with the closing of the frontier to trade. As a result, Serbia found fresh markets, foreign trade increased by 10 million dinars, credits for slaughterhouses and canning plants were obtained from France, and imports were arranged from Germany. Serbian hostility to Austria-Hungary had increased, and a need for a trade outlet to the Adriatic Sea developed, sharpening Serbia’s nationalist ambitions with regard to Bosnia.
