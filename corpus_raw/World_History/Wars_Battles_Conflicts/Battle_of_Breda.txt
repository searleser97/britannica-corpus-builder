Battle of Breda,  (28 August 1624–5 June 1625). The capture of the fortress city of Breda, in Brabant (now part of Belgium and the Netherlands), was the last great Spanish victory of the Dutch Revolt. It was the finest moment of the illustrious military career of Ambrogio Spinola, who had previously taken Ostend after another lengthy siege.
The United Provinces and Spain had declared a twelveyear truce in 1609. When conflict resumed in 1621, the main Spanish tactic was an embargo of Dutch sea trade, as many in Spain thought land war too costly. In spite of this, in August 1624 Spinola besieged Breda, a vital stronghold in the ring of fortresses defending the United Provinces. The fortified city had a garrison of 9,000 and was well defended.
Spinola placed his army of 23,000 around the city and set about consolidating his position. He made a double circumvallation of siege works, and then pierced a nearby dyke, which flooded the lower ground and hindered any attack on his position. His intention was to starve Breda into submission. There were repeated efforts to break the siege or draw the Spanish away, but Spinola was able to repel them. First, Maurice of Nassau attempted to relieve Breda. When he died in April 1625, command of the Dutch armies passed to his half-brother, Frederick Henry, who, despite the assistance of an English army led by Sir Horace Vere, was also unable to save Breda.
In June, Breda’s governor, Justin of Nassau, surrendered to Spinola (a moment recorded by Spanish court artist Diego Velázquez). The surviving garrison of 3,500 was allowed to march out with the honors of war. The Spanish had gained a vital victory, but it had been an expensive one, leaving them unable to follow it up with  a sustained land campaign.
Losses: Dutch, 13,000 civilians and soldiers; Spanish, 5,000 of 23,000.
