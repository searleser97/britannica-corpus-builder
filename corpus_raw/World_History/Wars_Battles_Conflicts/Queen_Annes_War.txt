Queen Anne’s War,   (1702–13), second in a series of wars fought between Great Britain and France in North America for control of the continent. It was contemporaneous with the War of the Spanish Succession in Europe. British military aid to the colonists was devoted mainly to defense of the area around Charleston, S.C., and the exposed New York–New England frontier with Canada. English settlements were subject to brutal raids by French forces and their Indian allies. After the British capture of the key French fortress of Port Royal in 1710, French-ruled Acadia became the British province of Nova Scotia. In addition, under the terms of the Treaties of Utrecht (1713), Britain acquired Newfoundland and the Hudson Bay region from France.
