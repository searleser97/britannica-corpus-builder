Battle of Fleurus,  (June 26, 1794), the most significant battle in the First Coalition phase of the French Revolutionary Wars. Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and Jean-Baptiste Kléber led 73,000 French troops against 52,000 Austrians and Dutch, under Friedrich Josias, prince of Saxe-Coburg, and William V, prince of Orange, stadholder of Holland. Jourdan had taken Charleroi, in the rear of Coburg’s main forces, on June 25, after besieging it since June 12. Coburg, unaware that the town had fallen, was marching to relieve it and to protect his rear forces. His five attack columns were successful at first against the French lines and inflicted very heavy casualties. The larger French force was able to endure the casualties and counterattack. Coburg retreated across the Meuse the next day with only half as many losses as the victorious French. Nevertheless, within a month, the Austrians abandoned the southern Netherlands (modern Belgium), which was annexed by France.
