Second Battle of Fallujah,  (November 7–December 23, 2004), also called Operation Al-Fajr (“Dawn”) and Operation Phantom Fury, joint American, Iraqi, and British military campaign during the Iraq War that crushed the Islamic insurgents in Fallujah, Iraq, in the Sunni Muslim province of Al-Anbar. After the First Battle of Fallujah (April 4–May 1, 2004) left resistance fighters and foreign Muslim extremists in control of the city, the U.S.-led coalition decided to mount in November a follow-up campaign to retake the city to prevent a further spreading of the armed opposition to the U.S.-occupation of Iraq.
Fallujah was a stronghold of the deposed Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party, and after the First Battle of Fallujah, the city became a magnet for Iraqi resistance fighters and foreign Muslim volunteers. In November, the occupation forces decided to turn Fallujah into a trap where they would encircle the insurgents and destroy them. The city was surrounded with checkpoints to prevent insurgents from arriving or leaving. Realizing what was to come, 300,000 civilians fled the city. Intense shelling and air strikes pounded the city before the coalition troops moved in on November 8. The urban fighting was fierce, with concealed sniper positions and booby traps a severe danger. A great deal of destruction was caused by troops blowing holes in the walls of houses rather than risk a possibly booby-trapped door. After several days of street fighting, the city center was secured, but pockets of resistance endured for several weeks, each having to be reduced at a high cost in lives. The insurgents in Fallujah were largely destroyed, and the resistance never again challenged the coalition in open combat, but small-scale attacks across Iraq multiplied. Some 110 coalition forces were killed and some 600 wounded in the battle; some 3,000 insurgents were killed or captured. An unknown number of civilians, estimated to be in the thousands, were also killed.
