Black War,  (1804–30), term applied to hostilities between Tasmanian Aboriginal people and British soldiers and settlers on the Australian island of Tasmania (then called Van Diemen’s Land), which nearly resulted in the extermination of the Indigenous inhabitants of the island. Armed conflict began in May 1804, when a military detachment opened fire on an Aboriginal hunting party. The bitterness of Tasmanian Aboriginal people increased as settlers occupied choice hunting areas of the island for sheep raising and, when other food ran short, took to hunting kangaroos, greatly depleting this staple of Aboriginal people’s lives. Settlers continually harassed the Indigenous inhabitants; kidnapping, rape, and murder were common. Unable to meet the European terror in force, Tasmanian Aboriginal people resorted to attacks on isolated individuals and small groups. In the later 1820s this campaign intensified, and the term “Black War” is sometimes used only in relation to this narrower period.
In the autumn of 1830, the lieutenant governor, George Arthur, decided to segregate Tasmanian Aboriginal people on the southeastern peninsula of the island. Several thousand settlers were formed into a Black Line to drive Aboriginal people out of the bush. The campaign failed immediately, but power of the settlers, backed by the British military, was proving inexorable. Between about 1831 and 1835 an agent of Arthur, George A. Robinson, persuaded most of the remaining Indigenous people (approximately 200) to resettle on the Bass Strait island of Flinders. There, their number dwindled further; however, Tasmanian Aboriginal people had survived through intermarriage with Europeans on the main island and on other islands.
