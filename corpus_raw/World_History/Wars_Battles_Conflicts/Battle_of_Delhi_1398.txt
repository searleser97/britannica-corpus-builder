Battle of Delhi,  (17 December 1398). In 1398 the Mongol-Turkish warrior Timur, ruler of Central Asia from his capital at Samarkand, found a pretext to strike south into India. His victory over the sultan of Delhi confirmed the irresistible fighting qualities of his army and the awesome destructiveness that made him a legend of cruelty.
A devout Muslim, Timur alleged that his co-religionist Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud of Delhi was being too lenient toward his Hindu subjects. On this pretext he marched into the Indian subcontinent in late summer 1398, his tribal steppe horsemen plundering and massacring as they advanced. By the time Timur approached Delhi, his army was so encumbered with loot and captured slaves that military efficiency was imperiled. Timur’s solution was to order his followers to kill all their slaves—possibly around 100,000 people. Thus prepared, the invaders faced Sultan Mahmud’s army outside the walls of Delhi. The sultan had a force of war elephants, creatures with which the steppe warriors were unfamiliar. Timur had his men dig elaborate field fortifications—a system of trenches and ramparts—to block the charge of the pachyderms and give his nervous followers a sense of security.
The course of the battle is hard to piece together from the historical record. Incendiary devices played a part, including catapults that hurled pots of inflammable liquid. By one account, Timur had camels loaded with kindling that was set on fire, releasing them to spread panic among the Indian elephants. The charge of Timur’s horsemen was certainly decisive, reportedly scattering the Indian soldiers "as hungry lions scatter a flock of sheep." Victorious in the field, Timur unleashed his warriors upon Delhi in an orgy of destruction from which the city took a century to recover.
Losses: No reliable figures, although some sources give the Indian death toll as 1,000,000.
