First Battle of Fallujah,  (April 4–May 1, 2004), also called “Operation Valiant Resolve,” U.S. military campaign during the Iraq War to pacify the Iraq city of Fallujah, rid it of extremists and insurgents, and find those responsible for the March 31 ambush and killing of four American military contractors. The public display of the beaten and burned bodies of the four killed men provoked worldwide outrage as well as the American response to retake control of the city beginning on April 4. A third of the city had been retaken within a week, but due to the considerable destruction of the city and heavy civilian deaths by U.S. airstrikes, the interim Iraqi government pressured the American forces to withdraw from the city on May 1. The U.S. then turned over military operations to 1100-man Fallujah Brigade, but by September, the brigade had dissolved and turned over all of their American weapons and equipment to the insurgents. The U.S. suffered 27 deaths in the campaign; some 200 insurgents were killed and an approximate 600 Iraqi civilians, 300 of them believed to be women and children.
