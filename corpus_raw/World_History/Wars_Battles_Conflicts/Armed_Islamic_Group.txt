Armed Islamic Group, FrenchGroupe Islamique Armée (GIA),  Algerian militant group. It was formed in 1992 after the government nullified the likely victory of the Islamic Salvation Front in 1991 legislative elections and was fueled by the repatriation of numerous Algerian Islamists who had fought in the Afghan War (1978–92). The GIA began a series of violent, armed attacks against the government and against foreigners in Algeria and has been accused of civilian massacres—although it has been alleged that many such atrocities were committed by security-service infiltrators and special military units. It has also engaged in attacks abroad (particularly in France) and purportedly maintained links with militant Islamic groups throughout the world. Estimates of GIA strength have varied from hundreds to several thousand guerrillas.
