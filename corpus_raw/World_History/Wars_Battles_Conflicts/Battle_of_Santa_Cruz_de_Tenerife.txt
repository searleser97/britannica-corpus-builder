Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife,  (20 April 1657).  In 1654, Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the republican Commonwealth, declared war on Spain, unleashing English fleets to attack Spanish shipping and colonies in the Caribbean and Atlantic. In 1657, Admiral Robert Blake destroyed a Spanish treasure fleet in a daring raid at Santa  Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary Islands.
In spring 1657, Blake was blockading the Spanish port of Cadiz when he received news that a fleet carrying silver and gold from the Spanish colonies in the Americas was approaching. Consisting of seventeen ships, the fleet docked at Santa Cruz because it was unable to reach Cadiz. Aware of the oncoming threat, the Spanish carried their silver bullion ashore. On 20 April, Blake arrived with a fleet of twenty-three ships. Defending Santa Cruz was a castle and a string of smaller forts, which were all connected with a breastwork manned by musketeers.
Blake sent twelve ships under Vice Admiral Richard Stayner to attack the Spanish fleet. Blake was to attack the fortifications and provide covering fire. Stayner sailed into the harbor and anchored with his broadside facing close to the Spanish. He was able to destroy twelve of the Spanish ships and capture five, which he intended to tow away as prizes. As the English were under heavy fire from the fortifications and having difficulty maneuvering because of the winds, Blake ordered that the five captured ships be destroyed. When the tide turned, the English fleet was able to drift out of Santa Cruz to safety. Even though he had failed to capture the treasure, Blake was hailed as a hero in England, but died four months later on his way home. The Spanish, already low on funds to finance their war effort, were now unable to transport their treasure from the Canary Islands to Spain.
Losses: English, 40 dead and 110 wounded, no ships of 23; Spanish, all 17 ships.
