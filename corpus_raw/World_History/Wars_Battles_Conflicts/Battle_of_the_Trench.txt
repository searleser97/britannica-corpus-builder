Battle of the Ditch, (ad 627), Arabic Al-Khandaq (The Ditch),  an early Muslim victory that ultimately forced the Meccans to recognize the political and religious strength of the Muslim community in Medina.
A Meccan army of 3,000 men had defeated the undisciplined Muslim forces at Uḥud near Medina in 625, wounding Muhammad himself. In March 627, when they had persuaded a number of Bedouin tribes to join their cause, the Meccans brought a force of 10,000 men against Medina again. Muhammad then resorted to tactics unfamiliar to the Arabs, who were accustomed to brief, isolated raids. Rather than sally out to meet the enemy in the usual way—the mistake made at Uḥud—he had a ditch dug around Medina, according to tradition, at the suggestion of a Persian convert, Salmān. The Meccan horsemen were disconcerted and soon bored, and the coalition of Bedouin tribes started breaking up. After an unsuccessful siege, the Meccans dispersed. With the Muslim and Meccan forces now more evenly matched and the Meccans tiring of a war that was damaging their trade, Muhammad used his victory to negotiate greater concessions for the Muslims in a treaty at al-Ḥudaybiyah (628).
