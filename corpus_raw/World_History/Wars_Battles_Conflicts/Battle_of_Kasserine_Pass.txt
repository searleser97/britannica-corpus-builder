Battle of Kasserine Pass,  (14–24 February 1943), World War II event. The Axis offensive along the Kasserine Pass, in a gap in the Atlas Mountains of west-central Tunisia, was the first large-scale encounter in World War II between the Axis and the U.S. army. Although the Americans suffered a humiliating setback, they recovered quickly (with British reinforcements) and prevented the Axis from exploiting their initial advantage.
 On 14 February 1943 armored units from Erwin Rommel’s Panzer Army Africa launched an offensive against the Allies to forestall their advance into Tunisia. The spearhead of the Axis advance was directed against the Kasserine Pass, lightly held by inexperienced American troops with some British and French support. On 19 February a veteran German-Italian assault group smashed into the U.S. troops holding the pass. The German Panzer IV and Tiger tanks were vastly superior to the U.S. M3 light tanks and light antitank guns, and soon the Americans were retreating along the pass in disarray.
Confused responses from Lieutenant General Lloyd Frendendall’s U.S. II Corps only made matters worse. For a while a sense of panic pervaded the Corps’s command. Once through the pass, the Axis forces continued their advance, but severe winter weather, increasingly mountainous terrain, and stiffening Allied resistance slowed progress. Simmering disagreements between Rommel and his superiors as to how the advance should proceed now came to a head, and on 22 February Rommel called off the offensive. Two days later, after an intense U.S. air attack, Allied troops reoccupied the pass.
The battle, while a shock to the Americans, had little effect on the continuing advance on Tunis. But one final casualty of the clash was General Frendendall, who was replaced on 6 March by the considerably more aggressive Major General George S. Patton.
Losses: Allied, 10,000 casualties (6,500 Americans) of 30,000, plus 183 tanks; Axis, 2,000 casualties of 22,000, plus 34 tanks.
