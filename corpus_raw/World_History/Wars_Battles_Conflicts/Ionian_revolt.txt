Ionian revolt,  uprising (499–494 bce) of some of the Ionian cities of Asia Minor against their Persian overlords. The cities deposed their own tyrants and, with help from Athens, tried unsuccessfully to throw off Persian domination. Darius I of Persia used Athens’s involvement as a pretext for his invasion of Greece in 490, initiating the Greco-Persian Wars, which resulted in a stronger Athenian influence in western Anatolia.
