Naning War,   (1831–32), disastrous attempt by the British to exact tribute from the Minangkabau people of the Malay state of Naning, near Malacca. Claiming to have inherited a right formerly held by the Dutch, British officials at Malacca demanded one-tenth of Naning’s annual crop in 1829. Naning’s ruler, Abdul Said, refused and defeated a British force sent against him in 1831. A second expedition ended Naning’s resistance after a three-month campaign in 1832, but the costly and humiliating war discouraged British expansion in Malaya for the next four decades.
