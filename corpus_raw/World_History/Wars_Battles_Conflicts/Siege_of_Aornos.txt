Siege of Aornos,  (327 bc), conflict in which Alexander the Great seized a nearly impregnable natural stronghold blocking his route to India. Aornos is evidently modern Pīr Sarāi, a steep ridge a few miles west of the Indus and north of the Buner rivers in modern Pakistan. Unable to storm the rock, Alexander seized the hill opposite and threatened the Indians’ encampment with his catapults. They retreated but were caught, and many were slaughtered.
