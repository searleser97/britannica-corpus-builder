Battle of Beachy Head,  (10 July 1690). After besting the English at Bantry Bay, the French navy defeated an allied Anglo-Dutch fleet off Beachy Head, southern England. The victory briefly gave France control of the Channel and led to the imprisonment of the English admiral, Arthur, Earl of Torrington, in the Tower of London.
On 23 June 1690, the French admiral, Anne, Count of Tourville, sailed the combined Atlantic and Mediterranean fleets out of Brest. His force of seventy-seven ships of  the line outnumbered the Anglo-Dutch fleet in the Channel, which had thinned to fifty-seven ships of the line because many had been sent elsewhere to protect commercial shipping.
On 2 July, the fleets met near the Isle of Wight and sailed up the Channel without engaging. Torrington wanted to withdraw to protect his fleet, but on 9 July Queen Mary II ordered him to engage the French. The next day, near Beachy Head, he sailed toward the French with the Dutch in the vanguard. The Dutch failed to reach the front of the French line, so the leading French ships were able to cut across them while the French center completed an encirclement from the rear. The surrounded Dutch ships were battered mercilessly, the English unable to help them. After hours of fighting, Torrington broke off the fight by ordering his fleet to drop anchor, so the tide carried the French out of range. He then sailed for the Thames, abandoning Dutch ships too damaged to follow.
Imprisoned and court-martialed, Torrington was cleared of failing to support the Dutch but lost his post. Despite his supremacy, Tourville did not exploit his victory, sailing to Le Havre to rest and repair his fleet. By autumn, the Anglo-Dutch had ninety ships in the Channel, and the brief French superiority there was over.
Losses: Anglo-Dutch allied, at least 7 ships of 57; French, no ships of 77.
