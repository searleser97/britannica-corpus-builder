Battle of Dogger Bank,  (17 June 1696). The Battle of Dogger Bank was a naval encounter between a French force, under the command of the famous privateer, Jean Bart, and a squadron of Dutch ships acting as escort to a convoy of more than one hundred merchant vessels. The battle was part of the ongoing War of the League of Augsburg.
Almost one year after his victory over a Dutch squadron in the so-called Action of 29 June, the privateer Jean Bart was patrolling the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea, 60 miles (96 km) off the east coast of England, when he sighted a large merchant convey of more than one hundred vessels being escorted by five Dutch ships. Over the previous few days, Bart had skillfully avoided an English naval squadron that had been alerted to Bart’s presence in the area and had been looking to capture him. It was during this dangerous game of cat and mouse that Bart decided to launch an attack on the convoy with his twelve ships.
Although Bart’s ships were more powerful, his attack needed to be swift, because the English, under the command of Admiral Benbow, were not too far away. Bart attacked the Dutch flagship, Raadhuis Van Haarlem, and, after a few hours, the ship was destroyed and her captain killed. The remaining four Dutch ships surrendered after taking heavy damage, three of which later sank. Bart was able to capture and destroy twenty-five merchant vessels before sighting Benbow’s squadron and fleeing toward the coast of Denmark. The game of cat and mouse continued for another two months, but Bart eluded detection as he moved down the coast, arriving in Dunkirk in September. Bart’s action was one more success in the guerilla naval war and enhanced his hero status in France.
Losses: Allied, 5 naval vessels and 25 merchant ships; French, minimal casualties.
