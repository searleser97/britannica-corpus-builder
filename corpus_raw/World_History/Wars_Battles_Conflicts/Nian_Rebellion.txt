Nian Rebellion, Nian also spelled (Wade-Giles romanization) Nien,  (c. 1853–68), major revolt in the eastern and central Chinese provinces of Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui; it occurred when the Qing dynasty was preoccupied with the great Taiping Rebellion (1850–64) in southern and central China.
An offshoot of the Buddhist-inspired White Lotus secret societies, the Nian were motley bands of peasants, army deserters, and salt smugglers who had fomented sporadic outbreaks since the first decade of the 19th century. Oppressed by famine resulting from flooding during the 1850s and stimulated by government preoccupation with the Taiping, several Nian bands formed a coalition under the leadership of Zhang Lexing in 1855 and began to expand rapidly. Numbering from 30,000 to 50,000 soldiers and organized into five armies, they began to conduct plundering raids into adjacent regions. In 1863 they received a setback when their citadel, Zhihe (now Guoyang, Anhui province), was captured and Zhang Lexing was killed. But they soon reorganized, and in 1864 they were joined by those Taiping soldiers not defeated in the fall of the Taiping capital at Nanjing that same year. They began to adopt guerrilla hit-and-run tactics, using mobile mounted units to strike at the weak points of the Qing armies and then retreating into strategic hamlets.The government, by then free from problems with the Taiping, began to concentrate on the Nian and adopted a strategy of blockade. The rebels were gradually trapped and defeated.
