Preemptive force,  military doctrine whereby a state claims the right to launch an offensive on a potential enemy before that enemy has had the chance to carry out an attack.
The advantage of a preemptive strike is that, by being the first to act decisively, a state renders the enemy unable to carry out aggressive intentions. There are also several disadvantages to this strategy. For one, the threatened state might be wrong in its assessment of the threat and launch an unwarranted destructive attack. Second, the use of a preemptive force by one state might set a precedent that would lead to widespread abuse of the preemptive option.
Scholars and politicians sharply disagree on the ultimate legitimacy of the use of preemptive force. However, most do tend to agree on several fundamental prerequisites for a preemptive strike to be conceived as potentially justifiable. The attack has to come as a reaction to a perceived threat that is both absolutely credible and immediate. The state that reacts to the threat needs to make the case that a preemptive attack is the only effective way to defend itself. The preemptive action needs to be proportionate in scope and scale with the perceived threat. The wholly subjective nature of these judgments, however, places the burden firmly on the attacking state to justify its actions to the international community.
Proponents of preemptive force cite Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, as it explicitly protects “the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.” Opponents of the strategy of preemption argue that the article clearly conditions a defensive action on the previous occurrence of an attack, not on the perception of the possibility of an attack.
