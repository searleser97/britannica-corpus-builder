Battle of Toulouse,  (10 April 1814), one of the final engagements of the Napoleonic Wars. Fought in southern France, the battle proved that the French were still determined and able to fight. Ironically, it turned out to be a pointless encounter; four days earlier, albeit unknown to the French and British commanders, Napoleon had surrendered to the Allied Sixth Coalition.
During 1814 Field Marshal Wellington and his allies began to advance into southern France. Marshal Nicolas Soult, the French commander, withdrew to Toulouse to replenish his army, closely followed by Wellington and a combination of British, Portuguese, and Spanish troops.
Wellington surrounded the city on three sides. To the west, he dispatched Lieutenant General Sir Rowland Hill with his 2nd Division and the Portuguese Division to capture the suburb of St. Cyprien and draw away Soult’s troops. To the north, the 3rd Division, under Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Picton, and the Light Division would provide feint attacks, while, to the east, the main assault would be made against the dominating Heights of Calvinet. This attack would be led by two divisions under Marshal Sir William Beresford, supported by two Spanish divisions commanded by General Manuel Freires.
On the morning of 10 April Hill’s force took St. Cyprien with ease, but to the north an overeager Picton pushed on farther than ordered, and his troops were repulsed with heavy losses. Beresford initially had difficulties arriving at his start line, while the Spaniards attacked without British support and were driven off the heights with heavy losses. At last, Beresford managed to capture the position. Realizing the danger, Soult then quietly slipped away from Toulouse to the south, to agree to armistice terms with Wellington after learning of Napoleon’s abdication.
Losses: Allied, some 5,500 casualties of 50,000; French, some 2,700 casualties of 42,000.
