Battle of Antwerp,  (July 1584–17 August 1585). In the years after the Battle of Gembloux, the Spanish governor-general, Alexander Farnese, slowly consolidated his control of Flanders and Brabant. Spanish control of the southern Netherlands was complete when Farnese captured Antwerp in one of the most technically brilliant actions of the  Dutch Revolt.
Antwerp was the richest and most populous city in the Netherlands and a rebel stronghold ever since Spanish soldiers sacked it in 1576. In July 1584, Farnese laid siege to Antwerp. He constructed a network of forts that cut off access to Antwerp by land. Next, he decided to block the Scheldt River, which connected Antwerp to the rebel-controlled north. Huge piers were thrown out from heavily armed forts on either side of the Scheldt. Between them, a floating bridge of connected barges armed with cannon was constructed. The massive structure was completed on 25 February 1585.
Meanwhile the Dutch rebels had cut the dykes around Antwerp, hoping to flood the region, allowing their ships to bypass the blockade. Farnese still controlled the last dyke before Antwerp, the Kouwenstein, so his bridge was not outflanked. On the night of 4 April, an attempt was made to destroy the bridge by floating explosive ships down the Scheldt from Antwerp. The plan caused considerable damage, but Farnese’s engineers were able to repair the bridge. A similar attempt on 20 May failed. Elsewhere, rebels from the north failed twice to capture the Kouwenstein on 6 and 26 May. On 17 August, Antwerp surrendered.
After taking control of Antwerp, Farnese decreed that all its Protestants must convert to Catholicism or be exiled. Consequently, just under half of Antwerp’s population of about 80,000 migrated north.
Losses: Spanish, at least 1,600 of 11,700; Dutch rebels, several thousand of 20,000.
