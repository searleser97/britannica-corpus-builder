Carnatic Wars, also spelled Karnatic Wars,  series of military contests during the 18th century between the British, the French, the Marathas, and Mysore for control of the coastal strip of eastern India from Nellore (north of Madras [now Chennai]) southward (the Tamil country). The name Carnatic properly refers to the region occupied by the Kannada-speaking people, which roughly corresponds to the modern Indian state of Karnataka (formerly Mysore). In the 18th century the coastal Carnatic was a dependency of Hyderabad, within the Mughal Empire.
Succession disputes in both the Carnatic and Hyderabad opened the door for European intervention in support of various rival Indian claimants. At first the French, under Joseph-Franƈois Dupleix, governor of Pondicherry (now Puducherry; 1742–54), were successful both in the Carnatic and in Hyderabad, which the French officer Charles-Joseph Patissier, marquis de Bussy-Castelnau, controlled for seven years. Dupleix, however, was checked by forces of the British East India Company under soldier and first British administrator of Bengal Robert Clive in 1751, and the French claimant was defeated the next year. In the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), both the French and British sent armies to south India; the French were defeated at Wandiwash (1760), and the British captured Pondicherry (1761). Thenceforth, the British controlled the Carnatic through its nawab, who became deeply indebted both to the East India Company and to its individual officers. For later events, see Mysore Wars.
