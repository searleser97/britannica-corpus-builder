Moro Wars,  (1901–13), in Philippine history, a series of scattered campaigns involving American troops and Muslim bands on Mindanao, Philippines. The Moro fought for religious rather than political reasons, and their actions were unconnected with those of the Filipino revolutionaries who conducted the Philippine-American War (1899–1902).
When sovereignty over the Philippines passed to the United States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, the United States initiated a policy designed to assimilate the Moro into the Philippine nation and to curb some feudal practices such as slave trading. The result of this attempt to alter the traditional ways of the Moro was intransigence and rebellion.
Sporadic fighting took place in 1901 and was renewed in the spring of 1903. American troops were attacked near Lake Lanao in the interior of Mindanao. The best known of the American-Moro battles occurred in March 1906 at the top of Mount Dajo on the island of Jolo. Six hundred Moro who had taken refuge inside a large volcanic crater were killed by troops under Gen. Leonard Wood. Because a number of women and children were killed in the fight, Wood came under severe criticism in the U.S. Congress, but he was absolved of any wrongdoing by Pres. Theodore Roosevelt. Renewed hostilities occurred in September 1911 and June 1913. Fighting ceased thereafter, although Moro separatist movements continued into the 21st century.
