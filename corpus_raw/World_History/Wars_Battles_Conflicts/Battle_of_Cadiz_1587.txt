Battle of Cadiz,  (29 April–1 May 1587). Intense rivalry between England and Spain during the reign of Elizabeth I led Philip II of Spain to prepare an armada to invade England. In response, Elizabeth ordered a preemptive strike against the Spanish fleet, a daring raid its leader, Francis Drake, termed the "singeing of the king of Spain’s beard."
Tension between Protestant England and Catholic Spain grew during the reign of Elizabeth I. English privateers attacked Spanish ships, while the English aided Dutch rebels in their revolt against Spanish rule. In 1587, Elizabeth executed her Catholic cousin and heir, Mary Queen of Scots, for treason. In response, Philip prepared a large armada to invade England to overthrow Elizabeth and restore Catholicism. Elizabeth ordered Francis Drake to disrupt Philip’s plans.
The English fleet arrived at Cadiz on the afternoon of 29 April, and sailed through the defending galleys into the harbor. The English quickly sunk a Genoese merchantman and then began to attack the many ships at anchor, removing their cargoes and setting them alight. The Spanish defenders launched a number of hit-and-run attacks and managed to seize one isolated English ship. The next day, the English continued their attacks, despite the Spanish use of heavy onshore guns and fireships sent in to disrupt the English fleet. Unfavorable winds kept the English fleet in harbor a second night before Drake made his escape the next day. After he read a report on the raid, Philip II stated, "The loss was not very great, but the daring of the attempt was very great indeed." However, the English destruction of thousands of barrel staves, crucial to the manufacture of storage barrels, was to prove significant when the famed Spanish Armada of 1588 set out to sea to conquer England with too few barrels of food and drink.
Losses: English, 1 ship captured of 21; Spanish, 33 ships destroyed.
