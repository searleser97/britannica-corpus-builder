Battle of Dupplin Moor,  (Aug. 12, 1332), battle fought about 7 miles (11 km) southeast of Perth, Perthshire, a victory for Edward de Balliol, a claimant to the Scottish throne, over forces led by Donald, earl of Mar, regent for the young King David II. Secretly encouraged by King Edward III of England, Balliol and other knights who had been disinherited by David’s father, Robert I the Bruce, landed at Kinghorn in Fifeshire, where they routed the local troops. They marched to Dunfermline and then northward and, reaching the River Eann, forded it on the night of August 11–12. Dawn revealed the main Scottish force arrayed in two divisions ready to attack. Greatly outnumbered, Balliol adopted tactics later copied by Edward III at the Battles of Halidon Hill (1333) and Crécy (1346); most of his men at arms dismounted, while archers were posted at either flank. When the first Scottish division charged, flights of arrows drove its flanks in upon its centre. The charge of the second division failed to renew the Scottish momentum, and their men trod one another underfoot, more dying by suffocation than by the sword. Pursuing the fugitives, Balliol’s men entered Perth, and he was crowned king at Scone the next month. Although King David temporarily left the country, Balliol never received widespread recognition. In 1339 he lost Perth, and in 1356 he resigned his kingdom to Edward III.
