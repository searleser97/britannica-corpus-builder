Naval Battle of Campeche,  (30 April and 16 May 1843).  The naval battle of Campeche, a part of the struggle of the Republic of Texas to assert its independence from Mexico, was arguably the only battle ever won by sailing ships against steamships. It was also the last battle fought between ships crewed by British and U.S. sailors on opposing sides.
After the Battle of San Jacinto, Texas became a self-governing republic, but it still feared the Mexican government’s intentions. Farther south, Yucatán was also fighting for independence from Mexican rule.
Mexico mounted a blockade of the Yucatán coast, using two British-manufactured, British-crewed steamships: the large, iron-hulled, paddle-wheel frigate Guadalupe and the wooden-hulled, ironclad Moctezuma. The small Texan navy was in poor shape, its crews mutinous for lack of pay. The head of the navy, Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, accepted payment from the Yucatán rebels to aid them against the Mexicans. Moore commanded two wooden sailing ships: the sloop-of-war Austin and the brig Wharton. Aided by small vessels of the Yucatán navy, Moore broke through to the port of Campeche, surviving a two-hour running fight on 30 April. There he was trapped, with Guadalupe and Moctezuma waiting for him to emerge. Undaunted, Moore spent a fortnight fitting his ships with longer range guns, which would give him a better chance against the steamships when he attempted a breakout.
The Texans sailed out to take on the steamships on 16 May. In the exchange of fire, Austin suffered a good deal of structural damage, but the sailing ships’ broadsides took a heavier toll on the ironclads’ Mexican and British crews. Although the battle was largely a draw, the Texans returned to a heroes’ welcome in Galveston, preempting Texan president Sam Houston’s intention of arresting them for selling their services to another country.
Losses: Texan-Yucatan, 7 killed, 24 wounded; Mexican-British, 30 killed, 55 wounded;  no ships lost on either side.
