Count’s War, Danish Grevens Fejde,  (1534–36), the last Danish war of succession, which resulted in the strengthening of the monarchy and in the establishment of Danish Lutheranism, as well as in a change in the Baltic balance of power. The war derived its name from Count Christopher of Oldenburg. Christopher unsuccessfully led the forces of Lübeck, the principal nobles of Denmark, and much of the Danish peasantry against Prince Christian, the Lutheran heir to the throne of the recently deceased King Frederick I (reigned 1523–33). Christian’s forces, supported by the naval power of Sweden, reversed some initial military setbacks by the end of 1535. They put down a peasant revolt that had spread throughout Jutland, defeated Christopher’s army at Öxneberg, and destroyed a Hanseatic fleet, thus ending Lübeck’s power in the Baltic. Also, in 1535, Christian subdued a Norwegian revolt against his imposition of Protestantism. Although the war was for all practical purposes over, Count Christopher held Copenhagen until Prince Christian’s blockade of the city forced him to surrender on July 28, 1536. With Christian’s confirmation as King Christian III (reigned 1534–59), the monarchy was made hereditary, the Reformation was established in Denmark-Norway, and Norwegian autonomy was greatly reduced.
