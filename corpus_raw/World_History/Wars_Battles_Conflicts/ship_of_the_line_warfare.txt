Ship-of-the-line warfare, also called line-ahead battle,  columnar naval-battle formation developed by the British and Dutch in the mid-17th century whereby each ship followed in the wake of the ship ahead of it. This formation maximized the new firing power of the broadside (simultaneous discharge of all the guns arrayed on one side of a ship) and marked a final break with the tactics of galley warfare, in which individual ships sought each other out to engage in single combat by means of ramming, boarding, and so on.
The ships of the fleet arrayed themselves one after the other at regular intervals of about 100 or more yards, for a distance that could stretch 12 miles (19 km). When in battle, the entire column endeavoured to sail close-hauled—that is, as near as possible to the direction of the wind. By maintaining the line throughout battle, the fleet, despite obscuring clouds of smoke, could function as a unit under the control of the admiral. In the event of reverses, they could be extricated with a minimum of risk.
Advocates of a strict adherence to this form of naval warfare came to be known as “formalists,” who insisted that the line be maintained throughout battle whatever the situation. They were opposed by “meleeists,” who saw an advantage to breaking the line at the discretion of a squadron commander in order to pursue a fleeing enemy. The formalist viewpoint dominated British naval tactics until well into the 18th century. At that time the tactical advantages of the melee came to be recognized to the extent that at a signal from the fleet admiral for a “general chase” the line could be broken and enemy ships pursued.
