Battle of Firoz Shah,  (Dec. 21–22, 1845), conflict between the Sikhs and the British at Firoz Shah, on the Punjab Plain, northern India. It was the first of two decisive battles in the First Sikh War, 1845–46. A British force of about 18,000 men under Sir Hugh Gough attacked a Sikh army of 35,000 under Lal Singh in late afternoon. After a near repulse and a night of peril, the British achieved victory in the morning at a cost of about 2,400 casualties compared with about 8,000 Sikh casualties. Gough was criticized for his costly frontal attacks but went on to win final victory of the war at the Battle of Sobraon on Feb. 10, 1846.
