Battle of Nagashino,  (28 June 1575). In Japan’s Age of Warring States, Nagashino castle held out against the Takeda in a classic siege. The besiegers tried attacks by river, mining, and through fierce hand-to-hand assaults. Eventually a relieving army arrived and defeated the Takeda using an innovative combination of firearms and simple defenses, revolutionizing Japanese warfare.
The Takeda army that laid siege to Nagashino castle consisted of 15,000 men, of whom 12,000 took part in the subsequent battle. They were therefore considerably outnumbered by the Oda-Tokugawa force of 38,000 who advanced to meet them, and whose positions looked across the plain of Shidarahara toward the castle. Oda Nobunaga also had the advantage of a unit of 3,000 matchlock musketeers, whom he realized would need some form of physical protection, so his army built a palisade between the forested edge of the hills and the river. It was a loose fence of stakes, staggered over three layers, and with many gaps to allow a counterattack. The total front stretched for about 6,890 feet (2,100 m).
Nobunaga’s plan was for the matchlockmen to fire volleys as the Takeda cavalry approached. As they had only a short distance to cover, it was likely that there would be some casualties, but not enough to break the momentum of the charge. The horsemen would then be upon the hopeless ashigaru (foot soldiers) as they tried to reload. Horses and men carefully negotiated the shallow riverbed and mounted the far bank. At this point, with the horsemen close to the fence, the volley firing began. This broke the charge, but the battle lasted until mid-afternoon, when the Takeda began to retreat and were pursued.
Losses: Takeda, 10,000 dead, including 54 of 97 samurai leaders and 8 of the Twenty-Four Generals; Oda, comparatively few.
