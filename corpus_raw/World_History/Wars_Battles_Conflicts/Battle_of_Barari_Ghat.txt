Battle of Barari Ghat,  (Jan. 9, 1760), in Indian history, one of a series of Afghan victories over the Marathas in their war to gain control of the decaying Mughal Empire, which gave the British time in which to consolidate their power in Bengal. At the Barari Ghat (ferry station) of the Jumna (Yamuna) River, 10 miles (16 km) north of Delhi, the Maratha chief Dattaji Sindhia, retreating from the Punjab before the Afghan army of Aḥmad Shah Durrānī, was surprised by Afghan troops who, concealed by high reeds, crossed the river. Dattaji was killed and his army scattered. His defeat opened the way to the Afghan occupation of Delhi.
