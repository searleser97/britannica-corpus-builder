Battle of Gibraltar,  (25 April 1607). After their loss at the Battle of Ostend, the Dutch United Provinces geared up their maritime campaign against Spain. This culminated in the breathtakingly bold raid on the Spanish fleet in harbor at Gibraltar, one of the most celebrated Dutch naval victories in their war of independence.
The United Provinces had been sending warships to the southern Spanish coast since 1599 in an attempt to disrupt enemy shipping. In the wake of recent losses in Flanders, the Dutch launched a daring surprise raid against the Spanish fleet. The Dutch commander, Jacob van Heemskerk, sailed his fleet of twenty-six warships into the Bay of Gibraltar, where a Spanish fleet was anchored. The Spanish admiral, Don Juan Alvarez de Avila, had a force of twenty-one ships, which included ten large galleons, and outgunned the Dutch.
In the first approach, Van Heemskerk—in his flagship, Aeolus—targeted his opposite number’s flagship, San Augustin. As the ships engaged, a cannonball severed Van Heemskerk’s leg and he was mortally wounded. The captain of the Aeolus, Verhoef, took command of the fleet, but did not reveal the death of its admiral, and in the next broadside, the Spanish admiral was killed.
The smaller Dutch vessels lethally harried the larger Spanish ships, with two attacking each galleon. One of the Spanish galleons exploded when its magazine was ignited, and the flames spread to other ships, leaving the Spanish fleet in total disarray. With all other ships sunk or burned, the devastated San Augustin managed to raise the white flag, but the Dutch did not accept  the surrender. Instead, they rowed among the ruined Spanish fleet, shooting and stabbing survivors as they floated in the water.
Losses: Spanish, entire fleet of 21 ships and 2,000–4,000 men; Dutch, no ships and 100 men.
