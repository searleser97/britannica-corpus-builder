Siege of Maastricht,  (6 June–1 July 1673).  The Siege of Maastricht showed the genius of Sébastien Le Preste de Vauban, the most renowned military engineer of his day. In this siege, during the Franco-Dutch War, Vauban was able to capture the well-fortified city without a prolonged struggle.
The Dutch had helped block French expansion into the Spanish Netherlands in 1669. Louis XIV became progressively more anti-Dutch and invaded the United Provinces in 1672. The French captured many important Dutch cities, but bypassed Maastricht in their rapid advance north. By 1673, Dutch-held Maastricht was a major hindrance to French operations in the area, so  Louis moved to capture it. Maastricht was in a strong position and commanded a crossing of the River Meuse. It also had a garrison of around 6,000, with a skilled commander, Jacques de Fariaux. The siege began on 6 June. On 8 June, 7,000 peasants were conscripted to dig extensive lines to surround Maastricht. When Louis arrived on 10 June, he gave command of the siege to Vauban. Vauban unleashed the might of his battery of twenty-six guns. He ordered trenches to be dug parallel to the walls. Then he used artillery to protect sappers digging diagonal trenches toward a closer position where another trench was started. Using this technique, Vauban moved closer and closer to Maastricht. A direct assault on the walls on 25 June failed, with the loss of 300. Ultimately, it was the effective use of artillery and mines that made the position of the defenders untenable. On 30 June, Fariaux agreed to parlay, and the next day French troops entered Maastricht.
Losses: French, few of 45,000; Dutch, few of 6,000.
