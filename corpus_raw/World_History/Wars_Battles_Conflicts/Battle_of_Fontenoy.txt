Battle of Fontenoy,  (May 11, 1745), confrontation that led to the French conquest of Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession. It was the most famous victory of the French marshal Maurice, Count de Saxe.
The battle was fought 5 miles (8 km) southeast of Tournai (in modern Belgium), between 52,000 French troops under de Saxe and about 50,000 Allied troops (composed of English, Hanoverian, Dutch, and Austrian units) under William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, son of King George II of England. Cumberland was marching to relieve Tournai, which the French had besieged. De Saxe prepared to meet the Allied attack from a strong defensive position, which included hastily constructed redoubts. The Allied attack was a direct frontal push, with the Dutch and Austrians attacking the French right and the British and Hanoverians striking the well-prepared left. After initial attacks failed, Cumberland sent 15,000 infantry against the French left. When these troops halted to dress ranks, there occurred a celebrated incident in which Lord Charles Hay, of the Allied forces, dashed forward from the lines, drank a toast, and, according to a doubtful story related by Voltaire, invited the French to fire first. After entering the French camp in this first assault, the British retreated to reform and advance once again. Finally, the French artillery, cavalry counterattacks, and the charge of the Irish Brigade (in the French service) against the British right forced the massive Anglo-Hanoverian infantry formation to retreat with about 50 percent losses. Dutch losses in the other sector were also heavy. Total French losses were about 7,500. Cumberland retreated toward Brussels, and de Saxe followed the victory by taking Tournai and most of Flanders during the next four months.
