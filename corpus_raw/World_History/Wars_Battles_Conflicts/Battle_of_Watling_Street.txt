Battle of Watling Street,  (61ce). In this final decisive battle of Boudica’s revolt against Roman rule in Britain, a large British force was routed by the heavily outnumbered Romans, under the command of Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. The battle marked the end of resistance to Roman rule in southern Britain, which was to last until 410.
When King Prasutagus of the Iceni died, he left his lands to be divided between his daughters and the emperor, Nero. However, the Romans ignored Prasutagus’s will and seized his lands, flogged his widow Boudica, and raped their daughters. While the Roman governor, Suetonius, was campaigning in Anglesey, Boudica led the Iceni in rebellion. She attacked Camulodunum (Colchester), where her troops slaughtered thousands and set fire to the temple of Claudius, killing those who sheltered inside. She then turned her attention on London, burning the city and killing anyone who could not escape. Suetonius gathered his forces, amassing around 10,000 men.
Boudica’s rebel forces and Suetonius’s outnumbered but well-drilled army met on the Roman road called Watling Street, near Wroxeter in Shropshire. Roman rule in Britain was in the balance, so Suetonius had to choose his battleground carefully: a narrow gorge protected his flanks and a forest protected his rear. With open plains to the front, Boudica was forced to engage the Romans in a massive frontal charge that was funneled into a tight mass and cut down by volleys of javelin. Once the Britons were in disarray, Suetonius ordered his forces forward in typical Roman wedge-shaped formation. Despite their numbers the poorly armed Britons were no match for superior Roman discipline, armor, and weaponry. As the Britons retreated, the ring of wagons belonging to their families impeded their escape and they were massacred.
Losses: According to Roman sources: British, 80,000 men, women, and children; Roman, 400.
