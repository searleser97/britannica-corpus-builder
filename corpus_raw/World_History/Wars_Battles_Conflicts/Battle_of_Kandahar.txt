Battle of Kandahar,  (1 September 1880), decisive British victory in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–80).  After their defeat by Afghan forces at the Battle of Maiwand on July 27, British troops retreated and were besieged in Kandahar. Major General Sir Frederick Roberts, commanding British forces in Kabul, had the task of relieving the siege and restoring the prestige of the British Empire. His success made him a national hero.
While the British garrison at Kandahar bolstered the city’s defenses and held out against the army of Ayub Khan, Roberts left Kabul to begin his famous march to Kandahar on 8 August. His army marched in the full summer heat over difficult terrain with full battle kit. At one time, more than 500 troops were falling ill each day, and even Roberts was not immune, needing to be dragged on a litter for the final few days of the march.
By the time Roberts reached Kandahar on 31 August, he had force marched his army of 11,000 some 300 miles (483 km) in three weeks, in some of the most harsh conditions imaginable. There was no respite for the troops because the battle began the next morning, with an artillery bombardment of Khan’s positions. This was followed by the 92nd Highlanders and 2nd Gurkhas fighting their way northward village by village and a second similar operation to the south by the 72nd Highlanders and the 2nd Sikh. By midday, both forces converged on the Afghan camp, with the 3rd Brigade moving forward to support the attack.
The exhausted British expected an intense fight, but as they moved into the camp, they found that the Afghans had disappeared into the hills of Herat leaving behind their artillery and most of their supplies. Afghanistan came firmly under British influence. Roberts returned home to receive the thanks of Parliament and numerous honors and decorations.
Losses: British, 250 casualties of 11,000; Afghan, 1,500 casualties of 13,000.
