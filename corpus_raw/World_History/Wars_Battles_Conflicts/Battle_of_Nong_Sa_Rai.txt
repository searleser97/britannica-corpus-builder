Battle of Nong Sa Rai,  (1593), in Southeast Asian history, military encounter between the Tai (Thai) kingdom of Ayutthaya and the Toungoo dynasty of Myanmar (Burma) which put an end to the aggression that had been waged intermittently by Myanmar.
In 1569 the Toungoo conquered Ayutthaya and reduced it to a vassal state. After the great Toungoo conqueror King Bayinnaung was succeeded by his son Nanda Bayin (reigned 1581â€“99), it soon became apparent that the Toungoo empire was in less able hands. Although then-prince Naresuen, the actual ruler of Ayutthaya, performed vassal military service to Nanda Bayin against the rebel king of Ava in late 1583, he recognized that the time was ripe to pursue Tai independence. His renunciation of vassalage to Myanmar in 1584 was followed in the next two years by four unsuccessful Toungoo invasions of Ayutthaya.
Despite the bloodshed, misery, and resources exhausted by continual warfare, Nanda Bayin continued to attempt to crush Tai independence, launching further offensives in 1586 and 1587. Again, Naresuen was able to withstand the Myanmar onslaught. From 1587 to 1590, the kingdom of Ayutthaya experienced three years of relative peace. War had devastated the countryside, however, and earthquakes and famine created additional hardships.
At the end of 1592, the last Toungoo invasion was launched by Nanda Bayin in a final effort to subjugate Ayutthaya. A huge army commanded by the inept Crown Prince Minkyi-zwa invaded the Tai kingdom. The decisive battle took place at Nong Sa Rai, where Naresuen (who had become king in 1590) commanded the superior field position. After Naresuen slew the Toungoo crown prince in a man-to-man combat, the Toungoo forces, confused and demoralized, abandoned the expedition. The Battle of Nong Sa Rai marked the end of years of warfare and misery for both kingdoms. Myanmar did not pose a threat to Tai independence for the next 150 years.
