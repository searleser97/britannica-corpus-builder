Battle of Kosovo, Kosovo also spelled Kossovo,  (October 17–20, 1448), battle between forces of the Ottoman Empire and a Hungarian-Walachian coalition led by the Hungarian commander János Hunyadi at Kosovo, Serbia. The Ottomans won a decisive victory and thereby halted the last major effort by Christian Crusaders to free the Balkans from Ottoman rule and to relieve Constantinople (Istanbul).
Following an Ottoman victory over the Crusaders at Varna (1444), the Ottoman sultan Murad II invaded the Morea (the Peloponnese) in 1446 and compelled its Greek rulers to be his vassals. Murad then turned against the Albanian leader Skanderbeg, who resisted the Ottomans and was assisted by forces of the pope and of the king of Hungary. In 1448 Hunyadi led an army of Crusaders across the Danube to join forces with Skanderbeg, but he suffered a crushing defeat at Kosovo. That victory did not lead to the conquest of Albania, but it strengthened the Ottoman position on the Danubian frontier.
