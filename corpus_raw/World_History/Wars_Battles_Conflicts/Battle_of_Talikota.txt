Battle of Talikota,  confrontation in the Deccan region of southern India between the forces of the Hindu raja of Vijayanagar and the four allied Muslim sultans of Bijapur, Bidar, Ahmadnagar, and Golconda. The battle was fought on January 23, 1565, at a site southeast of Bijapur, in what is now northern Karnataka state.
The armies collectively numbered several hundred thousand, with large contingents of elephants. Each had been gathering in the area since late December 1564. The battle seems to have been decided by the Muslim artillery and the capture and execution of the ruling Hindu minister Rama Raya. The capital city of Vijayanagar was captured, destroyed over a period of five months, and never reoccupied. The raja and Rama Rayaâ€™s brother Tirumala retired to Penukonda, where the latter usurped the throne in 1570. The battle was decisive in breaking up the Vijayanagar empire, a domination by Telugu speakers over the Tamil- and Kannada-speaking south. It also began a final Muslim penetration of southern India that lasted until the end of the 18th century.
