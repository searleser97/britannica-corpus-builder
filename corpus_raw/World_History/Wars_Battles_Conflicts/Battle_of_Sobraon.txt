Battle of Sobraon,  (February 10, 1846), the fourth, last, and decisive battle of the First Sikh War (1845â€“46). The Sikhs were entrenched on the eastern British-held bank of the Sutlej River, their retreat secured by a bridge of boats. After an intense artillery duel, the Sikh entrenchments were stormed. The bridge of boats collapsed, turning the retreat into a rout; more than 10,000 Sikhs were killed trying to cross the river. The British also suffered severely, with 2,383 killed or wounded. Further resistance was impossible, and the Sikh state of Punjab in northwestern India came under British domination.
