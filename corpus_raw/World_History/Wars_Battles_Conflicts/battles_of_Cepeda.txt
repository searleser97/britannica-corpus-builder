Battles of Cepeda,  (1820, 1859), two engagements fought at Cepeda, in the Buenos Aires provincia of Argentina, during the decades of disunity following the declaration in 1816 of Argentine independence.
On Feb. 1, 1820, at Cepeda, federalist forces, made up of gauchos from Santa Fe and Entre Ríos provinces, defeated the unitarios (advocates of strong central government), who were led by Gen. José Rondeau, supreme director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Most of the unitarios were upper-class porteños (inhabitants of the port city of Buenos Aires). Several months of anarchy followed, known in Argentine history as the “terrible year of 1820.” The Buenos Aires Congress and the directory were terminated, and the unitarios were forced to agree to a treaty between their own and the other provinces, by which the autonomy of each was upheld. The treaty failed to solve the conflict between Buenos Aires and the hinterland, which continued intermittently for 40 more years.
On Oct. 23, 1859, Bartolomé Mitre, in command of a Buenos Aires army, was defeated at Cepeda by forces of the Argentine Confederation, led by Justo José de Urquiza. This defeat ended a six-year secession of Buenos Aires and forced that province to accept the federal constitution of 1853, which was, however, amended to allow Buenos Aires greater influence. The period of armed strife, however, was not closed until after the Battle of Pavón (1861).
