Battle of Ravenna,  (11 April 1512). The Battle of Ravenna is chiefly remembered for the tragic death of the brilliant young French commander, Gaston de Foix. This loss overshadowed an extraordinary triumph for the French forces, which inflicted appalling casualties upon a largely Spanish Holy League army.
Amid the shifting alliances that marked the Italian Wars, the French found themselves in conflict with a papal Holy League dependent on Spain for its military strength. In 1512 Gaston de Foix, Duke of Nemours since the death of his father at Cerignola, was appointed commander of the French army in Italy at the age of twenty-one.
His bold leadership immediately invigorated the French campaign. He took Brescia by storm in February and then marched on Ravenna, intending to provoke the Holy League into battle. Ramon de Cardona, Spanish viceroy of Naples and commander of the Holy League forces, duly obliged by leading an army to relieve Ravenna. Battle was joined on Easter Sunday. Both sides had learned the new rules of warfare in the gunpowder age. Reluctant to assault well-defended earthworks with cavalry or infantry, they indulged in an artillery duel, maneuvering unwieldy cannon to find effective lines of fire. After two hours, unable to stand passively taking losses, cavalry and infantry threw themselves forward in often disorganized assaults. Casualties were heavy as horsemen clashed in swirling melees and infantry swarmed over ramparts and ditches. The issue was decided when the French cavalry, having driven the opposing horsemen from the field, returned to attack the Spanish infantry. Amid the general slaughter of his forces, Cardona was taken prisoner. With the battle effectively over, de Foix was killed in a pointless skirmish with retreating Spanish infantry.
Losses: French, 4,500 of 23,000;  Holy League, 9,000 of 16,000.
