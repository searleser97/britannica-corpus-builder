Madiun Affair,   communist rebellion against the Hatta-Sukarno government of Indonesia, which originated in Madiun, a town in eastern Java, in September 1948. The Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) had been declared illegal by the Dutch following uprisings in 1926–27; it was officially reestablished on Oct. 21, 1945, when an independent Indonesia was proclaimed after World War II. The communists resumed political activities, and some of their leaders held high positions in the new republican government. In January 1948 the left-wing government was replaced by one headed by Mohammad Hatta. Hatta’s government planned to demobilize those guerrilla units under communist control. The communists opposed the program; the PKI propagated the formation of a communist national front and advised the armed units to challenge the demobilization. The PKI also criticized the republican government’s concessions to the Dutch in the Renville Agreement (Jan. 17, 1948). While communist leaders were on a propaganda tour, a local communist commander in Madiun took the initiative on Sept. 18, 1948, and seized power in Madiun. The communist leaders, taken by surprise, were trapped by their own propaganda and had no alternative but to support the rebellion. The Hatta-Sukarno government took firm action. The rebellion was put down within three months, and most of the PKI leaders were killed or imprisoned.
