Second Battle of the Marne,  (July 15–18, 1918), last large German offensive of World War I.
Following the success of his four major offensives in France from March to June 1918, the chief of the German supreme command, General Erich Ludendorff, conceived another offensive as a diversion to draw French troops away from the Flanders front, against which he planned to direct his final decisive offensive. In the diversionary attack, he intended to capture Reims and split the French armies. But the French general Ferdinand Foch had foreseen the coming offensive, and the Germans consequently met unexpected French resistance and counterattacks. German troops did cross the Marne River at several points but were able to advance only a few miles. British, American, and Italian units assisted the French in their defense. In the southwest the Germans advanced only 6 miles (10 km) under heavy fire before bogging down. On July 18 the German offensive was called off just as a great Allied counteroffensive began that same day. Allied troops attacked the Germans’ large Marne salient (i.e., a bulge protruding into the Allied lines), taking the Germans by surprise. Three days later the Allies crossed the Marne, and the Germans retreated to their former Aisne-Vesle lines. The counteroffensive was decisive in shifting the balance of power in the West against an increasingly exhausted German army.
