Comunero Rebellion, also called Comunero Revolt or Commoners’ Rebellion, Spanish Insurrección de los Comuneros,  popular uprising in 1780–81 in the Viceroyalty of New Granada. In response to new tobacco and polling taxes imposed in 1780 by the Spanish government, insurgents led by Manuela Beltrán in Socorro, Colombia, sparked a revolt that soon spread to neighbouring towns north of Bogotá. The rebels, in addition to demanding the cancellation of taxes, urged such wide-ranging reforms as protection of Indian lands and an increase in the number of Creoles appointed to administrative posts. A combined force of peasants and artisans, with some Creole leaders, marched on Bogotá to deliver the list of demands, which were swiftly met on June 4, 1781. Soon after the main rebel force had dispersed and returned homeward, however, the Spanish viceroy declared the concessions invalid and, reinforced by troops from the coast, moved to quash the vestiges of antigovernment sentiment. Many of the Creoles who had taken part in the uprising had done so reluctantly, and several of them turned informant as the Spanish reasserted control, took prisoners, and executed some rebel leaders. Roman Catholic clergy even threatened divine retribution on peasants harbouring rebellious sympathies. The mestizo peasant leader José Antonio Galán, who attempted to organize a second march on the capital, was hanged on January 30, 1782.
The Granadine revolt and another uprising—that of Túpac Amaru II in Peru, which was also put down in 1781—have often been called precursors to the wars of independence; however, the Comunero rebels had merely sought reforms, not independence, and had marched under the slogan "Long live the king, and down with bad government!" (“¡Viva el rey y muera el mal gobierno!”).
