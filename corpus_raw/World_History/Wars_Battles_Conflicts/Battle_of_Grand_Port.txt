Battle of Grand Port,  (22–27 August 1810), naval battle between France and Britain, the latter’s worst defeat at sea during the Napoleonic Wars. The Isle de France (Mauritius) was one of the last French overseas possessions to be captured by Britain. The Indian Ocean island was used as a base for raids on British trade into 1810, and its harbor, Grand Port, was the scene of a rare heavy naval defeat for Britain, with  four  frigates lost.
France’s possessions in the Indian Ocean, then known as the Île Bonaparte and Île de France (now Réunion and Mauritius, respectively) had been used throughout the Napoleonic wars as bases from which to launch attacks on Britain’s valuable trade with India and the East. After various naval skirmishes and ships captured and recaptured on each side, Île Bonaparte was taken by the British in July 1810, and the remaining fighting then focused around Île de France.
The British began with a series of attacks on Grand Port in the south of the island. Before long, a French squadron of three warships slipped into the anchorage following a brief combat. The British commander, Captain Pym, decided to attack the French, even though he knew that his ships would only be able to move in one at a time through the narrow, twisting channel.
The attack, on 22 August, turned into a complete fiasco. The one British ship that managed to get close to the French could not get most of its guns to bear and consequently was battered into wreckage. The next day, two other British ships were set on fire by their crews after becoming stuck fast, and on 27 August the last ship, which had still been trying to escape out of the bay, surrendered when French reinforcements arrived. The French success was ultimately short-lived. Stronger British forces quickly reached the area and completed the capture of the Île de France in December 1810.
Losses: British, 4 frigates, nearly 300 dead or wounded; French,  one ship lost, 150 dead or wounded.
