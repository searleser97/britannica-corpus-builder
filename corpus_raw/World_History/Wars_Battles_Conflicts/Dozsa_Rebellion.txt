Dózsa Rebellion,  (1514), unsuccessful peasant revolt in Hungary, led by nobleman György Dózsa (1470–1514), that resulted in a reduction of the peasants’ social and economic position.
During the reign of King Vladislas II (1490–1516), royal power declined in favour of the magnates, who used their power to curtail the peasants’ freedom. When the cardinal Tamás Bakócz called for volunteers to go on a Crusade against the Turks (April 16, 1514), about 100,000 discontented peasants joined the army. Dózsa, after having won a reputation for valour in the Turkish wars, was appointed leader. Although the Crusade was suspended on May 23, the peasants, without food or clothing, began to voice grievances against landlords and refused to disperse or reap the fields at harvesttime. The army announced its intention to overthrow the nobility and end oppression of the lower classes.
The rebellious peasants then attacked their landlords, burning hundreds of manor houses and castles and murdering thousands of nobles. They captured the fortresses of Arad, Lippa, and Világos, threatened Buda, and laid siege to Temesvár. But at Temesvár they were defeated by János Zápolya, voivode (governor) of Transylvania and future king of Hungary (reigned 1526–40). Dózsa and his chief lieutenants were captured, and on July 20 Dózsa was executed. By October 1514 the remnants of the rebel army had been crushed, and the Diet of 1514 condemned the entire peasant class to “real and perpetual servitude” and bound it permanently to the soil. It also increased the number of days the peasants had to work for their lords, imposed heavy taxes on them, and ordered them to pay for the damage caused by the rebellion.
