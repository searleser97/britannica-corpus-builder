Battle of Nanjing,  (24 August–10 September 1659). Zheng Chenggong, better known as Coxinga, was the most loyal supporter of the final claimant to the throne of the Ming dynasty after it had been replaced by the Manchu Qing dynasty. He led a series of campaigns that culminated in an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing in 1659.
The Manchus had fortified the area of the lower Yangtze River, including a formidable river barrage known as the "Boiling River Dragon." After four days’ exchanging artillery fire, Zheng’s fleet broke through and secured the riverside forts. Nanjing was their next objective, but conflicting advice reached Zheng. Some of his commanders were in favor of a blockade of Nanjing, but Zheng felt that a quick victory was needed to sustain the momentum.
Unfortunately the wind changed on 10 August, making it impossible to sail upstream, so Zheng and his men had to haul the ships along from the riverbank. This took two weeks, during which time the Manchus sent reinforcements. They then indicated to Zheng that they would be willing to surrender Nanjing after a month. A siege began, and there was so little activity that the besiegers went fishing in the local ponds instead of mounting guard duty. Sorties were made from inside Nanjing, which only served to irritate Zheng.
On 8 September, a major sortie was carried out via a secret passage. This caused many casualties, and Zheng withdrew some of his troops. The following day, another sortie occurred, and Manchu agents within Zheng’s army managed to cause a major explosion. Taking advantage of the confusion, the Manchus launched a full attack out of the city, and Zheng was obliged to retreat. After his defeat, Zheng was concerned with his own position rather than restoring the fortunes of the Ming dynasty.
Losses: Zheng, unknown; Manchu, 4,500 bodies in the river alone.
