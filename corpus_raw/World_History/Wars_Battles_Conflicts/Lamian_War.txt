Lamian War, also called the Hellenic War (323–322 bc),  conflict in which Athenian independence was lost despite efforts by Athens and its Aetolian allies to free themselves from Macedonian domination after the death of Alexander the Great. Athenian democratic leaders, headed by Hyperides, in conjunction with the Aetolian Confederacy, fielded an army of 30,000 men in October 323. The commander was the Athenian mercenary Leosthenes, who seized Thermopylae and kept a Macedonian army under Antipater blockaded in the city of Lamía until the spring of 322, when the arrival of Macedonian reinforcements from Asia forced them to raise the siege. Antipater retreated to Macedonia to regroup, but Leosthenes had been slain during the siege. Hyperides’ sixth funeral oration glories in the victory, but the loss of Leosthenes proved fatal to the Greek war effort. Outnumbered and deserted by their allies, the Athenians were defeated at the Battle of Crannon (September 322) and surrendered unconditionally. Abandoning Alexander’s liberal policy, Antipater forced Athens to accept an oligarchical government—with a property requirement for voting that reduced the voting population by two-thirds—and had Hyperides and Demosthenes, leaders of the anti-Macedonian party, sentenced to death.
