Siege of Delhi,  (8 June–21 September 1857).  The hard-fought recapture of Delhi by the British army was a decisive moment in the suppression of the 1857–58 Indian Mutiny against British rule. It extinguished Indian dreams of recreating the rule of the Mughal Empire. The rebellion lost its cohesion, allowing the British to defeat any remaining isolated pockets of resistance.
After the capture of Delhi by rebels in May, the British were unable to launch a counterattack because their army was dispersed over vast distances. It took quite some time for the British to assemble an army, but, in June, two columns were combined with a force of Ghurkas.
The makeshift force managed to occupy a ridge overlooking the city but was not large enough to launch an assault, marking the beginning of the siege on June 8. Inside the city were more than 30,000 mutineers loyal to Bahadur Shah, who was holding court as the Mughal emperor. The large numbers of mutineers meant that the British force felt as though  they were the ones under siege, and, as the weeks wore on, the British began to suffer from outbreaks of cholera and dysentery. However, reinforcements slowly arrived from the Punjab, including a siege train of thirty-two guns and 2,000 more men under the command of Brigadier General John Nicholson.
By early September, the British had assembled a force of some 9,000, which consisted of 3,000 regular troops and 6,000 Sikhs, Punjabis, and Ghurkas. The siege guns begun firing on September 8 and, by September 14, had made sufficiently large breaches in the walls to launch an attack. The assault was met with stiff resistance but by September 21, after a week of savage street-to-street fighting, Delhi was back under British control. Bahadur Shah was arrested and died in exile in Rangoon in 1862. He was the last of the Mughal emperors.
Losses: British, 1,200 dead, 4,600 wounded of 9,000; Indian, 5,000 dead or wounded of 40,000.
