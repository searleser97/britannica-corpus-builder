Battle of Prague,  (25–26 November 1741). The armies of eighteenth-century Europe have often been described as unimaginative, slow-moving, and inflexible. The French seizure of Prague in the War of the Austrian Succession defies these stereotypes; it was an operation using speed and stealth to achieve success with minimal casualties.
While the Prussians invaded Silesia, France sent an army under the command of the Duke of Belle-Isle to attack the Austrian Empire, supporting the claim of Elector Charles Albert of Bavaria to the Austrian throne. Along with Bavarian and Saxon contingents, the French first marched on Vienna, but then veered off into Bohemia, a part of the Austrian Empire.
The Austrians lost track of a French corps, led by Maurice de Saxe, advancing on the Bohemian capital, Prague. An experienced commander renowned for his intellectual grasp of the principles of war, Saxe discreetly went forward to reconnoiter the walled city’s defenses in person and recognized the chance for a surprise operation. Calling to his side one of his boldest officers, Colonel François de Chevert, he outlined a plan for a body of grenadiers to assault the walls by night. In order to avoid alerting the Prague garrison, the assault would be made without firing muskets; only bayonets were used to dispatch the soldiers on guard duty.
On the night of 25 to 26 November, Chevert and his men climbed ladders onto the parapet of a poorly defended section of the walls and had taken possession before the garrison realized what was afoot. The city gate was opened, and Saxe’s cavalry rode in, leaving Prague’s defenders no choice but to surrender. Charles Albert was crowned king of Bohemia the following day and later, briefly, held the title of Holy Roman Emperor.
Losses: Unknown, but light.
