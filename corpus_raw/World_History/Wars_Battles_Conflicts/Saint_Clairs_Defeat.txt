Saint Clair’s Defeat,  (November 4, 1791), one of the worst defeats ever suffered by U.S. forces in Indian warfare, precipitated by British-Indian confrontation with settlers and militia in the Northwest Territory following the American Revolution. Despite specific provisions in the Treaty of 1783 for the evacuation of its forts on the northwestern border, Britain had failed to yield these lucrative fur-trading posts. In hopes of reclaiming lost hunting grounds with British support, a Northwest Indian Confederation was gradually molded between 1785 and 1787, consisting mainly of Shawnee, Delaware, Ottawa, Iroquois, Ojibwa, Miami, and Potawatomi. Kentucky frontiersmen reacted to this threat by initiating raiding parties on native villages as early as 1788, and Indian warfare flared up the following year.
The first punitive expedition, led by General Josiah Harmar in 1790, was ambushed. In 1791 a second force of 3,000 men under General Arthur St. Clair carelessly pitched camp south of the Maumee River with few guards the night of November 3. Confederation warriors silently infiltrated the sleeping camp and mounted a surprise attack the next morning, killing more than 600 militiamen.
Indian morale was temporarily strengthened by St. Clair’s Defeat, and white settlement of Ohio was retarded while frontiersmen clung to the protection of nearby U.S. forts. The tide was reversed three years later, however, at the Battle of Fallen Timbers.
