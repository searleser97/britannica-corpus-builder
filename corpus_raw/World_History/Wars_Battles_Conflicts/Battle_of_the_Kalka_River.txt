Battle of the Kalka River,  (31 May 1223). During the first Mongol invasion of Russia, an army led by Jebei and Subedei defeated an alliance of Russian princes and the Cuman tribal group along the Kalka River (probably the modern Kalchik River in southeastern Ukraine). The victory, part of a prolonged raiding campaign, devastated the Russian princes’ armies and demonstrated the raw power of the Mongol cavalry.
In 1221 Mongolian generals Jebei and Subedei led an army of 20,000 on a raid through Azerbaijan, into Georgia and along the Caspian Sea into Russia. The raiders defeated an alliance of Turkic tribes from the steppes, including the Alans, Cherkes, and Kipchaks, then wiped out two armies of Cumans (another Turkish tribe); the few Cuman survivors appealed for help to Russian princes.
These princes—including Mstislav III of Kiev, Mstislav of Galich, and Yuri II of Vladimir—Suzdal-raised an army of 30,000 men in alliance with the Cumans and, by advancing on three separate fronts, attempted to encircle the Mongol force on the banks of the River Dnieper. The Mongols made a feigned retreat to the east, leaving a rearguard of 1,000 men to fight under the command of Hamabek; this rearguard was wiped out by an army commanded by Mstislav of Galich, who then pursued the main Mongol force.
After nine days in retreat, the Mongols turned to engage Mstislav on the banks of the Kalka River. They attacked the Russian army head-on and on the flanks, with typical ferocity. The Cumans fled, causing disarray in the Russian ranks, and the Mongols swept through the gap this created. Afterward Jebei and Subedei forced the surrender of the Russian contingent under Mstislav of Kiev and pursued the remnants of Mstislav of Galich’s army, before giving up the chase and allowing him to escape.
Losses: Russian, 20,000 of 30,000; Mongol, very few.
