Battle of Stamford Bridge,  (25 September 1066). Were it not totally overshadowed by a more famous confrontation that took place at Hastings three weeks later, the Battle of Stamford Bridge between King Harold II of England and an invading Viking army led by King Harald Hadrada of Norway would be remembered as the last time the Vikings attempted to conquer England.
In January 1066 Edward the Confessor, King of England, died, having named Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, as his successor. Harold had earned the undying hostility of his brother Tostig, who had been ejected, with his brother’s approval, from his earldom in Northumbria the previous year. The vengeful Tostig formed an alliance with Harald Hadrada, King of Norway, promising to support Harald’s attempt to conquer England in return for regaining his earldom. The two crossed the North Sea with a fleet of 300 ships and sailed up the Humber River. Once ashore, the Viking army defeated an army led by the new Earl of Northumbria in alliance with the Earl of Mercia and occupied York. King Harold of England formed an army to repel the invasion and on 16 September left London for the north, reaching Stamford Bridge, just east of York, in only nine days. The two armies drew up the next day. An English offensive was soon reversed by a Viking counteroffensive led by Harald that almost turned the battle in their favor. Harald, however, was killed by an arrow in the throat. In response, Harold offered his brother peace, but Tostig fought on, encouraged by the arrival of Viking reinforcements. But the new arrivals were exhausted and soon fell in fighting during which Tostig was killed.
Losses: Viking, 4,000 of 5,000; English, unknown.
