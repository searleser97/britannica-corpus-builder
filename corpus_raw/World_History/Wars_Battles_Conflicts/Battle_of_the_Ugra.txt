Battle of the Ugra,  (1480), bloodless confrontation between the armies of Muscovy and the Golden Horde, traditionally marking the end of the “Mongol yoke” in Russia. By 1480 the Golden Horde had lost control of large portions of its empire; Ivan III of Moscow had stopped paying tribute to the Horde and no longer recognized it as an authority over Muscovy. In 1480 Akhmet, khan of the Golden Horde, led an army to the Ugra River, about 150 miles (240 km) southwest of Moscow, and waited there for his Lithuanian allies. The Muscovite army was drawn up on the opposite bank of the river. The two armies faced each other but did not fight. When the Lithuanians did not appear and Akhmet received word that his base camp near Sarai had been raided by allies of Ivan, he withdrew his army. The Muscovite army returned home. Although the event itself had little significance, Muscovite chroniclers later composed grandiose tales about it, giving rise to the notion that the Muscovites had won a great victory on the Ugra and liberated themselves from Mongol rule.
