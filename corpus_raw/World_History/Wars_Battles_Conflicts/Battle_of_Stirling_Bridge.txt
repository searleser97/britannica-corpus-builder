Battle of Stirling Bridge,  (11 September 1297). The kings of England repeatedly sought to extend their rule north of the border into Scotland. The death of the Scottish queen in 1290 gave Edward I of England the chance to take over the country, but his intentions were dashed with a major defeat at the hands of William Wallace.
The death of the seven-year-old Scottish queen, Margaret, in 1290 left the throne of Scotland vacant.  The Scottish lords gave Edward I the task of choosing a new king. He picked the weak John Balliol, a distant descendant of the great Scottish king David I, in the expectation that he would do Edward’s bidding. The English king, however, was quickly disabused of this idea when Balliol refused to join him on campaign in France and, in 1295, signed an alliance with France, England’s traditional enemy.
Edward was furious and in 1296 marched north to invade Scotland. He massacred the garrison at Berwick and then defeated Balliol at Dunbar, deposing him and ruling Scotland directly. The next year, the Scots, led by William Wallace, predictably rose in revolt against English rule. The two sides met at Stirling Bridge. A large English army commanded by the Earl of Surrey attempted to cross the River Forth via a narrow bridge in front of the Scottish lines. The smaller Scottish army, led by Wallace and Andrew de Moray, took advantage of their position up on a slope and hurled spears and other missiles down onto the advancing English knights.
The knights soon floundered in the marshy ground and many thousands of them were killed. Those English soldiers yet to cross the bridge fled the scene, ceding victory to William Wallace and the Scots. It was an ignominious defeat.
Losses: Scottish, unknown of 2,300; English, 5,000 of 8,000-12,000.
