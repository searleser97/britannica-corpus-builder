Battle of Samugarh,  (May 29, 1658), decisive struggle in a contest for the throne between the sons of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān after the emperor’s serious illness in September 1657. The battle was fought between the princes Aurangzeb and Murād Bakhsh, third and fourth sons of the emperor, on the one side, and the eldest son and heir apparent, Dārā Shikōh, on the other. Dārā had retreated to Samugarh, about 10 miles (16 km) east of Agra (Shah Jahān’s residence), south of the Yamuna (Jumna) River, after Aurangzeb had flanked Dārā’s fortified line along the Chambal River by finding a little-known and unguarded ford. Dārā’s army of about 60,000 was larger, but Aurangzeb’s was more experienced. The battle was fought during north India’s warmest season, and it was decided by Dārā’s descent from his elephant at a critical moment, which his troops mistook to indicate his death. After the battle, Aurangzeb imprisoned his brother Murād and Shah Jahān, while Dārā, after a long pursuit and a second defeat, was executed in 1659.
