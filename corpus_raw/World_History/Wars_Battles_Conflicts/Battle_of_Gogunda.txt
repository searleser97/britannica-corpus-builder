Battle of Gogunda, also called Battle of Haldighat,  (June 1576), battle fought in Rajasthan, northwestern India, between Pratap Singh of Mewar, the senior Rajput chief, and a Mughal army led by Raja Man Singh of Jaipur. It represented an attempt by the Mughal emperor Akbar to subdue the last of the independent chiefs of Rajasthan. Pratap Singh made a stand at the pass of Haldighat, about 12 miles (19 km) from the fortress of Gogunda and northwest of Udaipur. The Mughals were victorious, but the Battle of Gogunda became legendary for the heroic Rajput resistance against heavy odds. Pratap continued his resistance from hill fastnesses, and Mewar did not finally acknowledge the Mughals until 1614.
