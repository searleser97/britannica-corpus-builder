Siege of Rhodes,  (Juneâ€“December 1522). Led by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, the  Siege of Rhodes was the second attempt by the Ottoman Empire to defeat the Knights Hospitaller and take control of Rhodes. Control of the Greek island would consolidate Ottoman control of the eastern Mediterranean.
Selim I had vastly expanded Ottoman territory in the Muslim Middle East. His successor, Suleiman, now took the Christians as his target. Suleiman learned from the failed attempt of 1480: this time the Ottomans doubled the size of their fleet to more than 300 ships and, along with a force of 75,000, besieged the island in June 1522, blockading the harbor and bombarding the town.
The walls had been strengthened after the first siege but, after several weeks, the cannons breached a section allowing the Ottomans to launch an attack on the English section. For a day, the Ottomans attacked, but English and German knights repelled them. After attacks on other parts of the ramparts failed, the Ottomans decided to explode mines under the walls but these attacks were repelled, too. In early December, the bombardment ceased while the two sides negotiated. However, peace talks broke down and the bombardment continued with increased ferocity as more artillery had been brought from Anatolia.
The Grand Master could see that the situation was hopeless and surrendered in December to avoid loss of civilian life. Suleiman was generous, in recognition of the bravery of the defenders. In late December, the knights marched out of the town carrying their banners and were transported safely to Crete aboard Ottoman ships. Although costly, the capture of Rhodes was a significant victory for the Ottomans. The Knights Hospitaller relocated to Malta.
Losses: Ottoman, 25,000 of 75,000; Knight Hospitaller, 3,000 of 7,500.
