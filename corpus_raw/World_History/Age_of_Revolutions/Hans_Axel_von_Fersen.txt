Hans Axel von Fersen,  (born Sept. 4, 1755, Stockholm, Sweden—died June 20, 1810, Stockholm), Swedish-French soldier, diplomat, and statesman who was active in counterrevolutionary activity after the French Revolution of 1789 and the rise of Napoleon.
The son of Fredrik Axel von Fersen, Hans, like his father, transferred from the Swedish to the French army. He served under the Count de Rochambeau, who aided the American forces during the American Revolution (1775–83), distinguishing himself during the decisive Siege of Yorktown (1781).
Fersen became a close friend and, allegedly, the lover of Queen Marie-Antoinette of France in the early 1780s before returning to Sweden to join the diplomatic service. When the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90 began, Fersen was sent back to Paris as a diplomatic agent. After the French Revolution, he arranged the (unsuccessful) escape attempt of the king and queen (1791) and himself drove the coach in which they left Paris. Later Fersen worked in Vienna and Brussels for a European coalition against the Revolution. In 1801 he was named riksmarskalk (earl marshal) of Sweden, and in 1805 he was adviser to King Gustav IV during the war of the Third Coalition against France. Fersen played no part in the 1809 revolution that overthrew the king, but he supported the candidacy of the king’s son against that of the popular Christian August of Augustenburg. When the latter died suddenly as king-elect in 1810, a rumour spread that Fersen had conspired to cause his death. Fersen was killed by an enraged mob.
