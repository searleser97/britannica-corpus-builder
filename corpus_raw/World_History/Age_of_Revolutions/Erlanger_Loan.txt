Erlanger Loan,   in U.S. history, attempt of the Confederate government to raise funds abroad during the American Civil War.
In 1863 the Confederacy entered into an arrangement with the French banking house of Emile Erlanger & Company. Erlanger agreed to market $15,000,000 worth of Confederate bonds backed by cotton. He could receive the bonds at 77 (i.e., $77 per $100 face value) and sell them in foreign financial markets at 90. In addition, he received a 5 percent commission for selling the bonds.
The bonds were attractive to speculators because they could be exchanged for cotton after the war at a price well below the current market value. The bonds fluctuated wildly during the course of the war, however, as Confederate military fortunes waxed and waned. The bonds became worthless when the South finally collapsed, but by that time Erlanger had reaped enormous profits. He held no bonds by the time their value disintegrated, and although Erlanger had taken much of the sale price, the South had received more than $6,000,000 to aid in their war effort.
