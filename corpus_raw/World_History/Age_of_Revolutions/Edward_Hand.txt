Edward Hand,  (born Dec. 31, 1744, King’s County, Ire.—died Sept. 3, 1802, Lancaster, Pa., U.S.), American army officer during the American Revolution.
Trained as a doctor in Ireland, Hand served with the British army on the Pennsylvania frontier from 1767 to 1774, before resigning his commission to practice medicine in Lancaster. An early supporter of the American cause, Hand was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the rifle battalion that Pennsylvania raised in 1775. He served at the Siege of Boston, the Battle of Long Island, and the battles of Trenton and Princeton, N.J., demonstrating tactical and administrative abilities that earned him promotion to brigadier general on April 1, 1777.
Assigned to Fort Pitt, in western Pennsylvania, Hand improved the effectiveness of the local militia and secured the neutrality of the Delaware Indians and some Shawnee clans. His proposals for active defense against hostile tribes foundered for lack of resources, and rising public criticism led him to request relief. In October 1777, he was reassigned to the northern frontier, where the next year he played a major role in the campaign against Britain’s Iroquois Confederacy allies.
Returning to George Washington’s main army, Hand in 1781 was appointed its adjutant general. He overhauled administrative and training procedures, but frustration with the indifference of the Continental Congress led him to threaten resignation. At Washington’s urging, however, he continued in the post until the end of the war. A committed Federalist, Hand subsequently served in the Continental Congress and the Pennsylvania Assembly, helped suppress the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, and was a customs inspector from 1791 to 1801. His success in a variety of challenging tasks places him among the best of the Revolution’s citizen-soldiers.
