Pyotr Ivanovich, Prince Bagration,  (born 1765, Kizlyar, Russia—died September 24 [September 12, Old Style], 1812, Sima), Russian general who distinguished himself during the Napoleonic Wars.
Bagration was descended from the Georgian branch of the Bagratid dynasty. He entered the Russian army in 1782 and served several years in the Caucasus. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–92, he participated in the siege of Ochakov, a fortress near the mouth of the Knepr River, and he helped suppress the Polish uprising (1794) after the second partition of Poland (1793).
He achieved prominence, however, by capturing Brescia during General Aleksandr Suvorov’s victorious campaign against Napoleon in Italy and Switzerland (1799). He further enhanced his reputation in 1805, when he assured the safe retreat of the main Russian army into Moravia by holding back a French force of 30,000 men with his 6,000 troops at Hollabrunn. He subsequently participated in a series of unsuccessful battles: Austerlitz (Dec. 2, 1805), Eylau (Feb. 7–8, 1807), Heilsburg (June 10, 1807), and Friedland (June 14, 1807); but, after Russia formed an alliance with France (Treaty of Tilsit; July 7, 1807) and engaged in a war against Sweden, Bagration marched across the frozen Gulf of Finland and captured the strategic Åland Islands (1808). He was then transferred to the south (1809) and placed in command of a force fighting the Turks in Bulgaria (Russo-Turkish War of 1806–12). When Russia and France renewed their hostilities (1812), he was given command of the 2nd Russian Army in the West. Although his troops were defeated by the French at Mogilyov and separated from the main Russian army in July, he saved them from destruction and rejoined the main force in August. On Sept. 7, 1812, at the Battle of Borodino, near Moscow, Bagration commanded the left wing of the Russian forces and was fatally wounded. A monument was erected in his honour by Emperor Nicholas I on the battlefield of Borodino.
