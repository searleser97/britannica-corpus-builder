Allan Nevins,  (born May 20, 1890, Camp Point, Illinois, U.S.—died  March 5, 1971, Menlo Park, California), American historian, author, and educator, known especially for his eight-volume history of the American Civil War and his biographies of American political and industrial figures. He also established the country’s first oral history program.
Nevins was raised on a farm in western Illinois and educated at the University of Illinois. While completing postgraduate studies there, he wrote his first book, The Life of Robert Rogers (1914), about the Colonial American frontier soldier who fought on the loyalist side. After graduation Nevins joined the New York Evening Post as an editorial writer and for nearly 20 years worked as a journalist. During this period he also developed his credentials as a historian; he compiled and edited a collection of documents entitled American Social History as Recorded by British Travellers (1923); wrote two works on U.S. history, The American States During and After the Revolution, 1775–1789 (1924) and The Emergence of Modern America, 1865–1878 (1927); and produced a biography of explorer John Charles Frémont, Frémont, The West’s Greatest Adventurer (1928).
In 1928 Nevins accepted a post at Columbia University (New York City), where he remained for the next 30 years. While at Columbia Nevins produced an impressive body of work, including two Pulitzer Prize-winning historical biographies: Grover Cleveland, A Study in Courage (1932) and Hamilton Fish, The Inner History of the Grant Administration (1936). In 1948 he inaugurated the oral history movement in the United States, establishing at Columbia a project for preserving on tape interviews with notable figures whose views of current affairs would interest future historians.
Mandatory retirement from the Columbia faculty (1958) ended neither Nevin’s career as a teacher nor his scholarly contributions as a historian. Having established himself as a leading authority on the American Civil War with the major portion of his eight-volume work—Ordeal of the Union, 2 vol. (1947), The Emergence of Lincoln, 2 vol. (1950), and The War for Union, 4 vol. (1959–71)—Nevins headed the nation’s Civil War Centennial Commission (1961–66) and helped to edit the commission’s 15-volume Impact Series. He joined Huntington Library in San Marino, California, as senior research associate, served for a term as a visiting professor at the University of Oxford (1964–65), and wrote the final volumes of his Civil War series.
Among Nevin’s other notable works are John D. Rockefeller, The Heroic Age of American Enterprise, 2 vol. (1940; rewritten and expanded as A Study in Power: John D. Rockefeller, Industrialist and Philanthropist, 1953); a three-volume work (in collaboration with Frank E. Hill) on Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company; and, with historian Henry Steele Commager, America, The Story of A Free People (1942).
