Ann Bailey, née Ann Hennis,  (born 1742, Liverpool, Eng.—died Nov. 22, 1825, Gallia county, Ohio, U.S.),  American scout, a colourful figure in fact and legend during the decades surrounding the American Revolutionary War.
Ann Hennis moved to America, probably as an indentured servant, in 1761. Her first husband, Richard Trotter, a Shenandoah Valley settler and survivor of General Edward Braddock’s disastrous expedition of 1755, was killed at the Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774. Thereupon his widow adopted male dress, took up rifle and tomahawk, and became a frontier scout, messenger, spy, and Indian fighter. She was the subject of numerous adventures, both true and legendary, and became widely known as the “white squaw of the Kanawha” and more bluntly as “Mad Ann.” In 1788 she moved with her second husband, John Bailey, also a scout, to “Clendenin’s Settlement” on the site of present-day Charleston, West Virginia. The settlement’s principal feature was Fort Lee, and its siege by Native Americans in 1791 provided the occasion for Ann Bailey’s most famous exploit. When the defenders’ powder ran low, she volunteered to ride for help. She dashed from the fort and through the host of besiegers, rode 100 miles (160 km) through the forest to Fort Union (present-day Lewisburg), and returned on the third day with powder. After her second husband’s death she went to live with her son in Ohio.
