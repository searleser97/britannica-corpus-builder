Battle of Perryville,  (October 8, 1862), in the American Civil War, engagement of Union and Confederate troops as General Braxton Bragg was leading the Confederates in an advance on Louisville, Kentucky, from Chattanooga, Tennessee. Union troops, under General Don Carlos Buell, were marching from Louisville when they unexpectedly encountered the Confederate army. A bloody but indecisive battle ensued at Perryville, near Danville, Kentucky. Braggâ€™s forces held the field, though, and continued to control the area until forced to withdraw three months later following the Battle of Stones River.
