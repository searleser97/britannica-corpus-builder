Philippe-Antoine, Count Merlin, byname Merlin de Douai,  (born October 30, 1754, Arleux, France—died December 26, 1838, Paris), one of the foremost jurists of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods.
As a deputy for the town of Douai in the revolutionary Constituent Assembly of 1789, he was instrumental in the passage of important legislation abolishing feudal and seignorial rights. Merlin was elected to a new assembly, the National Convention, in September 1792, and he voted for the death sentence at King Louis XVI’s trial in January 1793.
After July 1794 Merlin was almost continuously a member of the Committee of Public Safety, in which he supported the reaction against the extreme revolutionary Jacobins. He also drew up the code of crimes and penalties enacted by the Convention in October 1795. On the inauguration of the Directory (November 1795), Merlin was appointed minister of justice. Two days after the coup d’état of 18 Fructidor, year V (September 4, 1797), he became one of the five directors, resigning in June 1799 under threat of impeachment.
Under Napoleon, Merlin became procurator-general (1804) and did more than any other lawyer to fix the interpretation of the Napoleonic Code. He was appointed a councillor of state in 1806 and created a count in 1810. At the first Restoration (1814) Merlin immediately went over to Louis XVIII. During Napoleon’s return in the Hundred Days, he was elected to the Chamber of Representatives and appointed minister of state. Banished at the time of the second Restoration, he went into exile in the Low Countries. He returned to France during the July Revolution of 1830.
