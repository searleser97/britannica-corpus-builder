Alfred-Amédée Dodds,  (born Feb. 6, 1842, Saint-Louis, Senegal—died  July 18, 1922, Paris, Fr.), French military figure who played a leading role in French colonial expansion in West Africa in the late 19th century.
After training at the prestigious military academy of Saint-Cyr, Dodds joined the French marine force. A company commander in the Franco-German War, he was captured at the Battle of Sedan in 1870, only to escape and return to combat in the Loire campaign. After the war Dodds returned to West Africa, where, except for brief visits to Indochina (1878 and 1883), he spent the next 20 years. In 1892–93, he led the campaign against the native forces of King Behanzin of Dahomey. His victory at Abomey (1892) was vital to the eventual linkage of French possessions in upper Senegal and the upper Niger region.
In 1899 Dodds was appointed inspector general of the marine infantry and soon after was given command of the 20th (colonial) army corps. In 1904 he returned to Paris and served on the conseil supérieur de guerre (high command of war, an autonomous command group) until 1914.
