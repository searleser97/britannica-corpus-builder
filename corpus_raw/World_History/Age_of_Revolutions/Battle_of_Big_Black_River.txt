Battle of Big Black River,  (May 17, 1863), American Civil War victory of Union forces under General Ulysses S. Grant, who were pursuing Confederate troops under General John C. Pemberton toward Vicksburg, Mississippi. After his defeat at Champion’s Hill (May 16), Pemberton left 5,000 troops to make a stand on both sides of the Big Black River, while he withdrew with his main command to nearby Vicksburg. Ten thousand attacking Union troops led by Grant routed the demoralized Confederate defenders, inflicting heavy losses and capturing over 1,700 prisoners. The survivors began a disorderly flight and retreated within the entrenched lines of Vicksburg, which was soon besieged by Grant’s army.
