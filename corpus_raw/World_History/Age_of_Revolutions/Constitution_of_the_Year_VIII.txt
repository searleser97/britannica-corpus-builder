Constitution of the Year VIII,  French constitution established after the Coup of 18–19 Brumaire (Nov. 9–10, 1799), during the French Revolution. Drafted by Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès, it disguised the true character of the military dictatorship created by Napoleon Bonaparte, reassuring the partisans of the Revolution by proclaiming the irrevocability of the sale of national property and by upholding the legislation against the émigré nobility. It created the regime known as the Consulate, which concentrated all real power in the hands of Napoleon. Submitted to a plebiscite, it won overwhelmingly in 1800.
