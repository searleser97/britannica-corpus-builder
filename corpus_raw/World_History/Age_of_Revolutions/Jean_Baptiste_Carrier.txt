Jean-Baptiste Carrier,  (born March 16, 1756, Yolet, Fr.—died  Dec. 16, 1794, Paris), radical democrat of the French Revolution who gained notoriety for the atrocities he committed against counterrevolutionaries at Nantes.
By 1790, the year after the outbreak of the Revolution, Carrier was counsellor to the bailliage (administrative district) of Aurillac. He became a prominent member of the Jacobin and Cordeliers clubs—two very influential revolutionary societies—and in September 1792 he was elected to the National Convention.
In March 1793 Carrier helped set up the Revolutionary Tribunal that tried suspected counterrevolutionaries. The Jacobins, in alliance with the Parisian lower classes, seized control of the Revolution in June 1793, and in August the Committee of Public Safety (the National Convention’s executive body) sent Carrier on a mission to Brittany. Two months later he was ordered to save Nantes from the antirepublican insurgents of the Vendée.
Because he was unable to obtain enough food for the rebels jailed at Nantes, Carrier ordered many of them to be guillotined or shot. In addition, between November 1793 and January 1794 he had more than 2,000 prisoners loaded into boats that were scuttled in the Loire River. Word of these noyades (“mass drownings”) reached Paris, and, on Feb. 8, 1794, Robespierre, the chief spokesman of the Committee of Public Safety, had Carrier recalled. Carrier helped bring about Robespierre’s downfall on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794) and, during the ensuing Thermidorian reaction against the Jacobin regime, was convicted of mass murder and guillotined.
