Battle of Leipzig, also called Battle of the Nations,  (Oct. 16–19, 1813), decisive defeat for Napoleon, resulting in the destruction of what was left of French power in Germany and Poland. The battle was fought at Leipzig, in Saxony, between approximately 185,000 French and other troops under Napoleon, and approximately 320,000 allied troops, including Austrian, Prussian, Russian, and Swedish forces, commanded respectively by Prince Karl Philipp Schwarzenberg, General Gebhard Leberecht Blücher, General Leonty Leontyevich Bennigsen, and the Swedish crown prince Jean Bernadotte. After his retreat from Russia in 1812, Napoleon mounted a new offensive in Germany in 1813. His armies failed to take Berlin, however, and were forced to withdraw west of the Elbe River. When the allied armies threatened Napoleon’s line of communications through Leipzig, he was forced to concentrate his forces in that city. On October 16 he successfully thwarted the attacks of Schwarzenberg’s 78,000 men from the south and Blücher’s 54,000 men from the north, but he failed to defeat either decisively. The number of troops surrounding him increased during the lull on the 17th, when Bennigsen and Bernadotte arrived.
The allied attack on the 18th, with more than 300,000 men, converged on the Leipzig perimeter. After nine hours of assaults, the French were pushed back into the city’s suburbs. At 2 am on October 19, Napoleon began the retreat westward over the single bridge across the Elster River. All went well until a frightened corporal blew up the bridge at 1 pm, while it was still crowded with retreating French troops and in no danger of allied attack. The demolition left 30,000 rear guard and injured French troops trapped in Leipzig, to be taken prisoner the next day. The French also lost 38,000 men killed and wounded. Allied losses totaled 55,000 men. This battle, one of the most severe of the Napoleonic Wars (1800–15), marked the end of the French Empire east of the Rhine.
