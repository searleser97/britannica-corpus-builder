Klondike gold rush,  Canadian gold rush of the late 1890s. Gold was discovered on Aug. 17, 1896, near the confluence of the Klondike and Yukon rivers in western Yukon territory. By 1897 up to 30,000 prospectors had arrived in the newly created towns of Skagway and Dyea, jumping-off points to the Canadian goldfields several hundred miles away. Many of the seekers died from malnutrition, hypothermia, or avalanches along the route. The Klondike gold rush was short-lived and had essentially ended by 1899,
and soon prospectors began moving on to Alaska. The Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park in Skagway commemorates the gold rush.
