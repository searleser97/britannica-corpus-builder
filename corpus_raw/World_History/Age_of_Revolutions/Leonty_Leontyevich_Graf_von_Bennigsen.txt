Leonty Leontyevich, count von Bennigsen, original name Levin August Gottlieb (Theophil) von Bennigsen,  (born Feb. 10, 1745, Brunswick, Duchy of Brunswick [Germany]—died Oct. 3, 1826, Banteln, near Hildesheim, Hanover), general who played a prominent role in the Russian Army during the Napoleonic Wars.
Having gained military experience while serving in the Hanoverian army (until 1764), Bennigsen joined the Russian Army in 1773 as a field officer and fought against the Turks in 1774 and 1778. He became a colonel in 1787 and participated in the Russian suppression of a Polish uprising (1793), as well as in the brief Russian invasion of Persia in 1796.
Opposed to the policies of the emperor Paul I (reigned 1796–1801), Bennigsen was active in the conspiracy that led to Paul’s assassination (March 23 [March 11, Old Style], 1801). He subsequently was appointed governor-general of Lithuania (1801) and general of the cavalry (1802) by the new emperor Alexander I (reigned 1801–25). After Russia joined the third coalition against Napoleon (1805), Bennigsen was placed in command of an army that successfully defended Pułtusk (near Warsaw) from a French attack (Dec. 26, 1806), and he inflicted severe losses upon Napoleon before retreating from the battlefield at Eylau (Feb. 8, 1807). On June 14, 1807, however, he was decisively defeated at the Battle of Friedland; Russia made peace with France (Treaty of Tilsit; July 1807), and Bennigsen retired.
When the war with France resumed (1812) he again played a leading role, commanding the Russian centre at the Battle of Borodino (Sept. 7, 1812) and defeating the French marshal Joachim Murat at Tarutino (Oct. 18, 1812). A dispute with the supreme Russian commander, General Mikhail Kutuzov, forced him into retirement again; but after Kutuzov died (1813) and Russia pursued the French into Prussia and the Duchy of Warsaw, Bennigsen was recalled to duty. On the final day of the Battle of Leipzig (Oct. 16–19, 1813) he led one of the columns that made the decisive attack, and that evening he was made a count. Afterward he fought the forces of the French marshal Louis Davout in northern Germany. In 1818 Bennigsen retired for the last time, settling on his Hanoverian estate of Banteln near Hildesheim.
