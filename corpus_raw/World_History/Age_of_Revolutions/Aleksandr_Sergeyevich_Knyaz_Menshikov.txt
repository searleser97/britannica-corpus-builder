Aleksandr Sergeyevich, Prince Menshikov,  (born August 15 [August 26, New Style], 1787—died April 19 [May 1, New Style], 1867, St. Petersburg, Russia), commander of the Russian forces in the first half of the Crimean War.
He began his army career in 1809 and achieved the rank of major general in 1816. In 1853, during the conflict over the protection of Christians’ privileges at the holy places in Palestine, Menshikov was sent on a special mission to Istanbul; his insistence that the Russian government be recognized as the protector of the Ottoman Empire’s Orthodox subjects led to the breakdown of negotiations between Russia and Turkey and to the beginning of the Crimean War (1854–56). Subsequently appointed supreme commander of the Russian land and sea forces in Crimea, he was defeated by the British and French in the Battle of the Alma on September 20, 1854. His attempt to relieve Sevastopol failed when he suffered severe losses at the Battle of Inkerman on November 5. Relieved of his command in March 1855, he was later appointed military governor-general of Kronshtadt.
