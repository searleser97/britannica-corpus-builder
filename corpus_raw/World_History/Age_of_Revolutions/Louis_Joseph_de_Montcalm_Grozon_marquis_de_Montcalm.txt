Louis-Joseph de Montcalm-Grozon, marquis de Montcalm, in full Louis-Joseph de Montcalm-Grozon, marquis de Montcalm de Saint-Veran,  (born Feb. 28, 1712, Candiac, France—died  Sept. 14, 1759, Quebec), general who served as commander in chief of French forces in Canada (1756–59) during the Seven Years’ War, a worldwide struggle between Great Britain and France for colonial possessions.
Montcalm joined the army as an ensign at age nine. His first war experience came in 1733 against the Austrians in the War of the Polish Succession (1733–38).
In the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48) he distinguished himself during the defense of Prague (1742), and he was made colonel of his regiment at Auxerre in 1743. He again distinguished himself at the Battle of Piacenza (1746), where he received five sabre wounds and was taken prisoner. He was later exchanged. In 1747 he was raised to the rank of brigadier, with command of a cavalry regiment by the end of the war.
Montcalm had inherited his father’s titles and property in 1735. He now spent a few years with his family at Candiac. In 1756 he was placed in command of the French regular troops in North America, with the rank of major general; but his commission did not include authority over the greater part of military resources in Canada. He clashed with the governor general of the colony, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, and their animosity handicapped efficient military operations. Montcalm had early success as tactical commander against the British. In 1756 he forced the surrender of the British post at Oswego, thus restoring to France undisputed control of Lake Ontario. In 1757 he turned southward and captured Ft. William Henry, with its 2,500-man garrison; the victory was marred, however, by the slaughter of many English prisoners by the Native American allies of the French.
Montcalm’s greatest feat was at Ticonderoga (July 8, 1758), when, with about 3,800 men, he repulsed an attack by 15,000 British forces under Gen. James Abercrombie. British casualties amounted to nearly 2,000, compared with 377 for the French. The victory was largely a result of Abercrombie’s incompetence; nevertheless, Montcalm was promoted to lieutenant general and given authority over Vaudreuil in all military affairs.
In 1759 the British sent Gen. James Wolfe’s 8,500-man army against Quebec. Montcalm, with a total command of about 15,000 men, took up a defensive position on the banks of the Montmorency River and refused to be drawn into combat for two months. Wolfe finally effected a landing near Quebec by scaling the Plains (Heights) of Abraham, and Montcalm, without waiting for reinforcements, marched out of the city to meet the British forces (September 13), which were victorious. After fighting with conspicuous gallantry, Montcalm was mortally wounded while trying to rally his shattered army.
