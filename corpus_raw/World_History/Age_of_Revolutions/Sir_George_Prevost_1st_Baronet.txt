Sir George Prevost, 1st Baronet,  (born May 19, 1767, New Jersey [U.S.]—died January 5, 1816, London, England), soldier in the service of Great Britain, who was governor in chief (1811–15) of Upper and Lower Canada (now Ontario and Quebec). He was known for his conciliatory policies toward French Canadians.
Prevost attained the rank of major in the British army by 1790. From 1794 to 1796 he saw active service in the West Indies. In 1798, as a brigadier general, he was made lieutenant governor of St. Lucia. He dealt successfully with the French there, adopting a policy of conciliation toward them, no doubt facilitated by his fluency in French. He was created a baronet in 1805 for his services in the West Indies.
In 1808 Prevost went to Nova Scotia as lieutenant governor. Four years later he was transferred to Quebec, where he was administrator of Lower Canada, then governor in chief of both Canadas. The previous governor, Sir James Craig, had alienated many of the French Canadians, but Prevost endeavoured to meet their demands. During the War of 1812, Prevost commanded the British forces in Canada. His military reputation was marred by two incidents: in 1813 he withdrew after a successful attack on Sackets Harbor, New York, and in 1814 he was defeated at Plattsburgh, New York, following another baffling retreat. Prevost was recalled to London in 1815 to face a court-martial, but he died before it was held.
