Charles-Hector, count d’Estaing, in full Jean-Baptiste-Charles-Henri-Hector, comte d’Estaing, marquis de Saillans,  (born November 24, 1729, Ruvel, Auvergne, France—died April 28, 1794, Paris), commander of the first French fleet sent in support of the American colonists during the American Revolution.
D’Estaing served in India during the Seven Years’ War and was governor of the Antilles (1763–66). He was appointed vice admiral in 1767 and in 1778 attempted to surprise the English squadrons in North America and enable the colonists to resume the offensive. His blockade of Admiral Richard Howe in New York Bay proved unsuccessful (July 1778), and in August storms prevented him from engaging the British fleet near Newport, Rhode Island. In November he sailed for the Antilles, where, despite several opportunities, he failed to eliminate a much smaller British squadron. He was seriously wounded in an unsuccessful attack on Savannah, Georgia (September–October 1779), and returned to France with his squadron. D’Estaing was an energetic commander, but his lack of naval experience caused him to be diffident before smaller British forces. His caution and hesitancy greatly disappointed the colonists during a crucial phase of the war.
In France, d’Estaing was an enlightened reformer; he was elected to the Assembly of Notables in 1787. He was commander of the National Guard at Versailles at the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789) and was guillotined in Paris during the Reign of Terror.
