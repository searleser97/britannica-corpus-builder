Johann Yorck, count von Wartenburg, Yorck also spelled York, Johann also rendered Hans,  (born Sept. 26, 1759, Potsdam, Prussia [now in Germany]—died Oct. 4, 1830, Klein-Öls, Silesia [now Oleśnica, Pol.]), Prussian field marshal, reformer, and successful commander during the Wars of Liberation (1813–15) against France. His initiative in signing a separate neutrality agreement with Russia during the Napoleonic invasion of that country (Convention of Tauroggen, 1812) opened the way for Prussia to join the Allied powers against Napoleon.
Yorck entered the Prussian army in 1772 but was cashiered for disobedience in 1779. Joining the Dutch army, he served mainly in the Dutch East Indies, where he became familiar with skirmish warfare and open battle formations. After reinstatement in the Prussian army (1787), he fought in Poland (1794) and successfully commanded the rear guard after Napoleon’s rout of the Prussian army at Jena (October 1806). Promoted to major general in 1807, Yorck, as inspector of light infantry, played a leading role in the reorganization of the Prussian army. An excellent tactician, he became the tactical teacher of the army, developing the infantry scout and the line of skirmishes. His conservatism, however, led him to oppose the liberal army reforms proposed by General August Neidhardt von Gneisenau.
In 1812 Yorck led the Prussian contingent of Napoleon’s invading army in Russia. During Napoleon’s disastrous retreat, he concluded the Tauroggen Convention with the Russians, neutralizing his force. The Prussian king Frederick William III signed the Treaty of Kalisch (Feb. 28, 1813), which justified Yorck’s action and brought Prussia into the Allied camp. In the subsequent campaigns, Yorck distinguished himself again and was created Graf von Wartenburg in 1814. He remained in the army after the conclusion of peace.
