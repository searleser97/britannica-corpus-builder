Battle of Chattanooga,  (November 23–25, 1863), in the American Civil War, a decisive engagement fought at Chattanooga on the Tennessee River in late November 1863, which contributed significantly to victory for the North. Chattanooga had strategic importance as a vital railroad junction for the Confederacy. In September 1863 a Federal army led by General William S. Rosecrans was besieged there by a Southern army commanded by General Braxton Bragg. The following month General Ulysses S. Grant took over the campaign to relieve the Union troops and seize the offensive. With the help of reinforcements from General Joseph Hooker and General William Tecumseh Sherman, the Federal forces defeated the Confederates in the Battles of Lookout Mountain (see photograph) and Missionary Ridge and lifted the siege; by the end of the month the Confederate army was in retreat into Georgia. Losses of men were less than at Chickamauga (about 6,000 Union and 7,000 Confederate), but the result was completely decisive, ranking in importance with Vicksburg and Gettysburg the same year. The way had been opened for Sherman’s march to Atlanta and Savannah the following year.
