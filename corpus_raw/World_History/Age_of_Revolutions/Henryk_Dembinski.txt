Henryk Dembiński, also spelled Henrik Dembinszky,  (born May 3, 1791, Kraków, Pol.—died June 13, 1864, Paris, France), Polish soldier and revolutionary leader. Dembiński was the chief military commander in the Polish revolt of 1830–31, and he served as commander in chief of the Hungarian army during the Hungarian revolution of 1848–49.
Dembiński was a student at the Vienna Academy of Engineering from 1807 to 1809. He then served as an officer of the duchy of Warsaw until 1814. For his leadership at the Battle of Leipzig, Dembiński was awarded the cross of the Legion of Honour. During the Polish revolt, he was considered the hero of the battle against the Russians at Ostrołęka.
Upon the defeat of the revolt, Dembiński went into exile in Paris. During that time he worked to create Polish units within the Spanish, Turkish, and Egyptian armies. In January 1849 he was recruited by Count László Teleki to command the Hungarian armies in the upper Transtisza, the region east of the Tisza River, and in central Hungary. Later that month he arrived in Hungary, but, following a defeat at the Battle of Kápolna (February 26–27) and protests from the officers’ ranks, he temporarily ceded his position to Artúr Görgei. When the Russian imperial troops attacked, however, Dembiński took command of the entire Hungarian army. On August 5, near Szőreg, he suffered defeat by Austrian troops led by Julius von Haynau  and was forced to retreat. Instead of joining Görgei at Arad (now in Romania), Dembiński marched toward Temesvár (now Timișoara, Rom.), and during the battle of Temesvár he handed over command on August 9 to another Polish general, Józef Zachariasz Bem. After this defeat he left the country along with other members of the government. He first sought asylum in the Ottoman Empire and then moved to Paris in 1850.
