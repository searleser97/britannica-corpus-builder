Jean-Baptiste, Count Jourdan,  (born April 29, 1762, Limoges, Fr.—died Nov. 23, 1833, Paris), military commander remembered as the sponsor of conscription during the French Revolutionary regime and as one of Napoleon’s marshals of the empire.
After being a soldier in King Louis XVI’s army and serving in the West Indies (1778–84), Jourdan retired and became a draper in Limoges. He supported the Revolution, however; and, having been elected lieutenant colonel of volunteers in 1791, he rose to general of a division (1793). After successes against the Austrians, he was made commander of the Army of the Moselle in March 1794. Executing Lazare Carnot’s new strategy of concentrating troops and artillery at points of attack, he marched westward to the Sambre River and, on June 26, won so decisive a victory at Fleurus, in Hainaut, that Austrian resistance west of the Meuse River collapsed. By October, his army was occupying all of Belgium.
Jourdan’s campaigns east of the Rhine River (1795 and 1796) were less successful; and, in 1797, he was elected to sit as deputy for Haute-Vienne in the council of Five Hundred. He was there responsible for the legalization of mass conscription (Sept. 5, 1798). His subsequent military career was largely unsuccessful, though in 1804 Napoleon appointed him a marshal. He was at last dismissed from command because of his failure to control his troops at the Battle of Vitoria (June 1813).
In 1814 Jourdan favoured Napoleon’s abdication and switched his loyalties to Louis XVIII. He was made head of the Army of the Rhine and named count (1816) and a peer of France (1819). He served for a few days as foreign minister during the July Revolution of 1830, then became governor of the Invalides. His Mémoires, edited by E.H. de Grouchy, appeared in 1899.
