John Sigismund, German Johann Sigismund,  (born Nov. 8, 1572—died  Jan. 2, 1620), elector of Brandenburg from 1608, who united his domain with that of Prussia.
His marriage in 1594 to Anna, the daughter of Albert Frederick of Prussia, made him heir to the title of that duchy, and he became duke of Prussia in 1618. Through his mother-in-law he acquired rights over the Rhenish territories of Jülich, Cleves, and Berg; but his claims were challenged by the Spanish candidate, Wolfgang William of Neuburg. Supported by the Dutch, John Sigismund acquired Cleves with the counties of Mark and Ravensberg by the Treaty of Xanten (1614). He espoused Calvinism (1613) but accorded toleration to his Lutheran subjects. Like his predecessor, Joachim Frederick, he was forced to make concessions to the nobles of Brandenburg. He was succeeded by his eldest son, George William.
