Christopher Gist,  (born c. 1706, Maryland [now in U.S.]—died  1759, South Carolina or Georgia), American colonial explorer and military scout who wrote highly informative journals describing his experiences.
Little is known about the early life of Gist, although it is probable that his surveyor father trained him in this profession. In 1750 he left his home in North Carolina with an appointment from the Ohio Company to explore territory in the Ohio Valley. That autumn he set out from western Maryland, explored the Ohio River to the mouth of the Scioto River, then crossed through the Kentucky region on his return journey to his family. He explored other portions of the Ohio–Kentucky area during the winter of 1752–53, becoming the first English colonist to explore this region.
In November 1753 Gist, then living in western Maryland, joined Major George Washington of the Virginia militia on his expedition against the French in western Pennsylvania. On two occasions he allegedly saved Washington’s life, and he was with him later when Washington surrendered Fort Necessity in July 1754. The next year, Gist served as a guide in General Edward Braddock’s disastrous expedition against Fort Duquesne, and he later organized and commanded a company of scouts protecting the frontier.
Gist spent his last years among the Cherokee tribes in the South, where he served as an Indian agent. His writings, published in 1893, offer excellent firsthand descriptions of the frontier environment, Indian life, and the campaigns that marked the beginning of the French and Indian War.
