Sir Charles Napier, Count Napier de São Vicente,  (born March 6, 1786, near Falkirk, Stirling, Scotland—died November 6, 1860, near Catherington, Hampshire, England), admiral in the Portuguese and British navies, the controversial commander of the British Baltic Fleet during the Crimean War of 1853–56. Created Conde Napier de São Vicente in the Portuguese peerage, he was less elegantly known in Great Britain as “Black Charley” and “Mad Charley.”
Napier became a midshipman in 1800 and served in the Napoleonic Wars and in the War of 1812 against the United States. In 1831 he was in the Azores to assist supporters of the Portuguese princess Maria da Glória (afterward Queen Maria II). Subsequently, as commander of the Portuguese loyalist navy, he destroyed the fleet of Dom Miguel, pretender to the Portuguese throne, off Cape St. Vincent on July 5, 1833. The next year he directed the loyalist forces in the defense of Lisbon against the Miguelites.
He rejoined the British navy in 1836. Napier for a time was second in command in the Syrian expedition of 1840–44, taking part in the capture of Beirut and Acre (October–November 1840). From 1847 to 1849 he commanded the Channel Fleet. In February 1854, at the beginning of the Crimean War, Napier was appointed commander of the Baltic Fleet. The British public’s extravagant confidence in him turned to odium when, alleging insufficient firepower, he refused to attack the great Russian naval base of Kronshtadt. After his recall he was never again offered a command.
