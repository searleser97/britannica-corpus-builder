Bruce Catton, in full Charles Bruce Catton,  (born October 9, 1899, Petoskey, Michigan, U.S.—died August 28, 1978, Frankfort, Michigan), American journalist and historian noted for his books on the American Civil War.
As a child living in a small town in Michigan, Catton was stimulated by the reminiscences of the Civil War that he heard from local veterans. His education at Oberlin College, Ohio, was interrupted by two years of naval service in World War I and was subsequently abandoned for a career in journalism. While he was employed as a reporter for the Boston American, the Cleveland News, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer (1920–26), Catton continued his lifelong study of the Civil War period. He subsequently worked for the Newspaper Enterprise Service (1926–41) and for the U.S. War Production Board. In 1954 he became the founding editor of American Heritage magazine, for which he wrote 167 articles, and from 1959 he served as its senior editor.
Catton was celebrated for the trilogy he wrote on the Army of the Potomac: Mr. Lincoln’s Army (1951), Glory Road (1952), and A Stillness at Appomattox (1953). The latter earned him both a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1954.
Catton’s brilliance as a historian lay in his ability to bring to historical narrative the immediacy of reportage. His other works included The War Lords of Washington (1948), U.S. Grant and the American Military Tradition (1954), and the much-lauded trilogy Centennial History of the Civil War: The Coming Fury (1961), Terrible Swift Sword (1963), and Never Call Retreat (1965).
