Archibald Campbell, 10th earl and 1st duke of Argyll,  (born 1651?—died September 25, 1703, Cherton House, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northumberland, England), one of the Scottish leaders of the Glorious Revolution (1688–89).
Campbell was the eldest son of the 9th earl, and he tried to get his father’s attainder reversed by seeking the favour of King James II. Being unsuccessful, however, he went over to The Hague and joined William of Orange as an active promoter of the Glorious Revolution. In spite of the attainder, he was admitted in 1689 to the convention of the Scottish estates as earl of Argyll, and he was deputed, with Sir James Montgomery and Sir John Dalrymple, to present the crown to William III in its name and to tender him the coronation oath.
In 1690, after the revolution, an act was passed restoring his title and estates, and it was in connection with the refusal of the Macdonalds of Glencoe to join in the submission to him that he organized a terrible massacre that made his name notorious. In 1696 he was made a lord of the treasury, and his political services were rewarded in 1701 by his being created duke of Argyll. He had two sons by his wife Elizabeth: John (the 2nd duke) and Archibald (the 3rd duke).
