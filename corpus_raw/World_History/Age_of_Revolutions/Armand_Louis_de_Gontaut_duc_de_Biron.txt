Armand-Louis de Gontaut, duke de Biron, also called Duc De Lauzun,  (born April 15, 1747, Paris, Fr.—died  Dec. 31, 1793, Paris), military commander with the French forces in the American Revolution, and one of the peers of France who supported the French Revolution, only to be sacrificed to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror.
In his youth, as Duke de Lauzun, he dissipated his fortune, traveling about Europe and earning notoriety for his gallantry and success with women. After inheriting his uncle’s duchy of Biron in 1788, he began to realize his military ambitions. He had raised colonial troops and taken Senegal in 1779, fought in the American Revolution under the Count de Rochambeau, and put his signature to notes on invading England and other military topics. But he was nephew of the Choiseuls and friend of the Duke d’Orléans (Philippe Égalité), and he had no favour at court. Even after the Revolution of 1789, he was overshadowed by the Marquis de Lafayette.
His chance came with the war in 1792. From Rochambeau’s staff he secretly devised with C.F. Dumouriez a plan that gave him the chief role in Belgium. He marched for Mons with 10,000 men who on April 29 fled from a much smaller force at Quiévrain. He was happy to escape from his own men, and this was his only action. Commanding on the Rhine River in July, transferred in 1793 to Italy, and sent, after Orléans was arrested, to command in the west, he was never present when there was actual fighting. He had accepted every political change, but, after 40 days in this last command, he was dismissed on July 11. Robespierre dared not risk the countercharge of leniency to a former peer, and Biron was guillotined. His Mémoires were published in 1822 (new ed., 1858).
