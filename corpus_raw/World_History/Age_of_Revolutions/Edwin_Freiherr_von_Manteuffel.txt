Edwin, Freiherr von Manteuffel, in full Edwin Hans Karl, Freiherr von Manteuffel,  (born Feb. 24, 1809, Dresden, Saxony [Germany]—died June 17, 1885, Carlsbad, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary), Prussian field marshal, a victorious general and able diplomat of the Bismarck period.
A cavalryman from 1827, Manteuffel became aide-de-camp to Frederick William IV of Prussia during the revolution of 1848. In 1854, during the Crimean War, he went on two diplomatic missions to Vienna and one to St. Petersburg, where he persuaded Emperor Nicholas I to withdraw Russian troops from the Danubian principalities. He then returned to Vienna to dissuade Austria from joining the war against Russia. In 1857 he was appointed chief of the Prussian Military Cabinet and in 1861 was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general.
A leading supporter of the crown during the Prussian constitutional crisis (1858–66), Manteuffel epitomized the political general who is also an effective field commander. After service in the war against Denmark (1864), he was made governor of Schleswig. During the Seven Weeks’ War (1866), Manteuffel occupied Holstein, led a division against the Hanoverians, and in July assumed command of the Army of the Main. Finally, he was delegated to explain Prussia’s German policy to the Russians.
In the Franco-German War of 1870–71, Manteuffel led the I Corps and distinguished himself in the battles of Colombey-Neuilly and Noisseville. As commander of the 1st Army (from October 1870), he won the Battle of Amiens (November 27) and occupied Rouen (December 6). Commanding the newly formed Army of the South (January 1871), he quickly overcame resistance in the south of France. When this unit was disbanded, he became commander of the 2nd Army. From June 1871 to September 1873 Manteuffel commanded the Prussian occupation forces in France, exhibiting remarkable tact. He then was made a field marshal and military governor of Berlin.
After the Congress of Berlin in 1878 Manteuffel once more went on a diplomatic mission to Russia, and from 1879 he was German imperial governor of Alsace-Lorraine.
