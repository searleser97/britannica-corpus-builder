Jean-Baptiste-Antoine-Marcelin, baron de Marbot,  (born Aug. 18, 1782, Altillac, Fr.—died  Nov. 16, 1854, Paris), general and author of memoirs of the Napoleonic period, whose book on war, Remarques critiques, prompted Napoleon to leave him a legacy.
Entering the army at 17, Marbot was aide-de-camp successively to three of Napoleon’s generals. Promoted to major and then to colonel of the Belgian light cavalry in 1812, he fought in the battles on the Dvina and Berezina rivers in Russia (1812) and on the Katzbach in Silesia (1813). After becoming colonel of hussars in 1815, he was promoted to general by Napoleon on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo. In exile after Waterloo, Marbot returned to France in 1819 and worked on his Remarques critiques (1820), a reply to Gen. Joseph Rogniat’s treatise on war, in which Marbot effectively contrasted the human factor in war with Rogniat’s pure theory. In 1826 he published a work on the new French Army. When Louis-Philippe became king in 1830, Marbot returned to service as aide-de-camp to Ferdinand, duc d’Orléans, with whom he saw action at the siege of Antwerp and in Algeria.
Marbot’s Mémoires of the empire, written for his children, was not published until 1891 (Eng. trans., 1892). His memoirs revived interest in the incidents and personalities of the First Empire but are not always historically reliable.
