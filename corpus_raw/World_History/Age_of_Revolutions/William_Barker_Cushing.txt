William Barker Cushing,   (born Nov. 4, 1842, Delafield, Wis., U.S.—died  Dec. 17, 1874, Washington, D.C.), U.S. naval officer who won acclaim for his daring exploits for the Union during the American Civil War (1861–65).
Appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1857, Cushing was obliged to resign four years later because of his irreverent attitude and practical jokes. The onset of the Civil War gave him a chance to redeem himself, however, and in four years’ time he had risen to the rank of lieutenant commander. Exhibiting courage and exceptional resourcefulness, he also experienced amazing good fortune and escaped a number of hazardous incidents without harm; the more superstitious sailors regarded him as invulnerable.
Cushing performed numerous feats throughout the war, the most spectacular being the destruction of the Confederate ironclad Albemarle in the Roanoke River, N.C., in October 1864. This vessel, which had done much damage to Union naval forces, was at anchor when Cushing, in a steam launch, eluded the Confederate lookout and exploded against the ship a spar torpedo with such success that it sank. Cushing’s own launch was destroyed and the crew compelled to take to the water; only he and one other man escaped capture or death. For this achievement he was thanked by Congress and promoted.
After the war, he continued to serve in the navy and was promoted to commander at the early age of 30.
