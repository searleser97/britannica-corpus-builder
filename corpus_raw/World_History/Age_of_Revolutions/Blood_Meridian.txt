Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West,  novel by Cormac McCarthy, published in 1985.
"See the child," orders the narrator at the beginning of Blood Meridian. Following this initial focus on a character that is known only as "kid" comes a voyage through Texas and Mexico after the U.S.-Mexico War of 1846. The kid’s travels are an odyssey strangled by an unimaginable violence—a violence that knows no limits and is exclusive to no particular race, be it white or indigenous, Mexican, or North American.
McCarthy learned Spanish for this novel, to help him imagine the squalid exchanges between the gang of amoral scalp hunters with whom the kid works and the people who emerge like ghostly ciphers on the desert horizons. The novel’s chapters are introduced thematically, like a list of occurrences in an old travel narrative. And yet, Blood Meridian quickly becomes something more than a historical novel. McCarthy’s achievement lies in his prose, which has been compared to the near-biblical style found in Melville and Faulkner.
In Blood Meridian, McCarthy introduces one of his devil-incarnate characters-the nameless, nefarious judge. He is a creature of equally limitless wisdom and evil who, like a degenerate Ralph Waldo Emerson, calmly preaches chains of dictums such as "Your heart’s desire is to be told some mystery. The mystery is that there is no mystery," while holding the great femur of "some beast long extinct." Ominously, the judge is a figure who cannot be made to disappear, a sinister reminder of the negative side of the American narrative of manifest destiny.
