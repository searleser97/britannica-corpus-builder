Shelby Foote,  (born November 17, 1916, Greenville, Mississippi, U.S.—died June 27, 2005, Memphis, Tennessee), American historian, novelist, and short-story writer known for his works treating the United States Civil War and the American South.
Foote attended the University of North Carolina for two years, and he served in the U.S. Army during World War II. His first novel, Tournament, was published in 1949. Like many of Foote’s later novels, it is set in Bristol, Mississippi, a fictional town modeled on Foote’s hometown. Follow Me Down (1950), considered by many critics to be his best novel, is based on an actual murder trial. It shows—through shifting monologues—a seduction and murder and, ultimately, the failure of love. The theme recurs in Love in a Dry Season (1951), which is set against the changing fortunes of the South from the 1920s to World War II.
Shiloh (1952), Foote’s first popular success, uses the monologues of six soldiers to recreate the Civil War battle of its title. Foote next set out to write what proved to be his masterwork, The Civil War: A Narrative (1958–74), which consists of three volumes—Fort Sumter to Perryville (1958), Fredericksburg to Meridian (1963), and Red River to Appomattox (1974). Considered a masterpiece by many critics, it was also criticized by academics for its lack of footnotes and other scholarly conventions. Despite its superb storytelling, the work received little popular attention until Foote appeared as a narrator and commentator in Ken Burns’s 11-hour television documentary The Civil War (1990). Foote also wrote the novel September, September (1977; filmed for television as Memphis, 1991), about the South in crisis, and he edited Chickamauga and Other Civil War Stories (1993).
