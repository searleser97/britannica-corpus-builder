Battle of Lundy’s Lane,  (July 25, 1814), engagement fought a mile west of Niagara Falls, ending a U.S. invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. After defeating the British in the Battle of Chippewa on July 5, 1814, U.S. troops under General Jacob Brown established themselves at Queenston. On the night of July 24–25, a British force under General Phineas Riall moved forward to Lundy’s Lane. On the 25th he was reinforced by troops from Kingston under the British commander in chief, General Gordon Drummond. The U.S. troops advanced, and the battle began at 6 pm. For hours on end, each side hurled desperate charges against the other in the dusk and darkness. The losses on both sides were the heaviest in the entire war. With fewer than 3,000 men, the British had 878 casualties, 84 of whom were killed; the Americans suffered 853 casualties, with 171 killed. Drummond, Riall, Brown, and the American general Winfield Scott were all severely wounded, and Riall was taken prisoner.
By midnight, the U.S. troops, too exhausted to attack again, fell back, leaving Drummond’s men in possession of the field. The British troops, in turn, were too exhausted to pursue. Neither side won a decisive victory, but the action stopped the advance of the Americans, who withdrew to Ft. Erie the next day.
