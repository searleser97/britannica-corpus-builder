Forced into exile for his activities in behalf of the Stuart pretender to the English throne (1715 and 1719), Keith served for a time in the Spanish army and in 1728 went to Russia, where he distinguished himself in the War of the Polish Succession and in campaigns against the Ottoman Turks and Sweden. In 1747 he entered the Prussian service and was made a field marshal by Frederick the Great. During the Seven Years’ War, he commanded Prussian forces at the siege of Prague (1757) and successfully defended Leipzig against the Austrians. He was killed in the Battle of Hochkirch. In 1868 a monument donated by William I of Prussia was erected to Keith’s memory at Peterhead in Scotland.
