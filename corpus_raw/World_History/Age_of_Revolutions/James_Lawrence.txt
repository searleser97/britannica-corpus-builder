James Lawrence,  (born Oct. 1, 1781, Burlington, N.J., U.S.—died  June 1, 1813, in a sea battle off Boston, Mass.), U.S. naval officer of the War of 1812 whose dying words, “Don’t give up the ship,” became one of the U.S. Navy’s most cherished traditions.
Lawrence entered the navy as a midshipman (1798) and fought against the Barbary pirates. He was first lieutenant to Lieutenant Stephen Decatur when the USS Philadelphia, which had been captured by the Tripolitans, was destroyed in Tripoli harbour by Decatur-led forces (1804). During the War of 1812 Lawrence commanded the USS Hornet in the capture of HMS Peacock. Shortly thereafter he was promoted to captain of the frigate Chesapeake. On June 1, 1813, the Chesapeake accepted HMS Shannon’s challenge to a sea fight off Boston (see photograph). The Chesapeake was decisively defeated in less than an hour and Lawrence was mortally wounded.
