Stand Watie, also called De Gata Ga (Cherokee: “Stand Firm”),  (born December 12, 1806, Rome, Georgia, U.S.—died September 9, 1871, Honey Creek, Indian Territory [now Oklahoma]), Cherokee chief who signed the treaty forcing tribal removal of the Cherokees from Georgia and who later served as brigadier general in the Confederate Army during the U.S. Civil War. Watie learned to speak English when, at the age of 12, he was sent to a mission school. He later helped an older brother publish the Cherokee Phoenix, a tribal newspaper.
In 1835 Watie joined three other Cherokee leaders in signing the treaty of New Echota, surrendering Cherokee lands in Georgia and forcing the tribe to move westward into Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). On the same day in 1839, all three other signers were murdered, but Watie escaped death and remained leader of the minority favouring the treaty.
In 1861 Watie raised and commanded the first volunteer Cherokee regiment—the Cherokee Mounted Rifles—mustered into the Confederate Army. Appointed a colonel by the Confederacy, he was promoted in 1864 to brigadier general after many engagements as a raider and cavalry commander in and around Indian Territory. He was especially active in destroying the fields and other property of Indians backing the Union. Watie remained loyal even after the majority party of the Cherokee in 1863 repudiated the 1861 alliance with the Confederacy. In fact, he was among the last of all Confederate officers to surrender, not doing so until June 23, 1865.
After the Civil War, Watie went to Washington, D.C., as a representative of the southern Cherokee. He spent his final years as a planter and businessman and in assisting in the collection of Cherokee tales and legends.
