Treaty of Kiel,  (Jan. 14, 1814), the peace treaty ending the hostilities between Denmark and Sweden during the Napoleonic Wars. By the treaty, Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden, thus ending the union initiated in 1380 and further reducing Denmark’s status as a Baltic and European power. By the accession of Norway, Sweden was partially compensated for the loss in 1809 of Finland and the Åland Islands to Russia; but Norway, increasingly opposed to the union with Denmark, reacted to being bartered to Sweden by framing a constitution and resisting Swedish incorporation. By its resolve to resist the Treaty of Kiel with arms, Norway forced Sweden to accept its constitution; the result was a royal union that lasted until 1905. Although Denmark retained the old Norwegian settlements of Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, the loss of Norway had a disruptive effect on its political and economic life.
