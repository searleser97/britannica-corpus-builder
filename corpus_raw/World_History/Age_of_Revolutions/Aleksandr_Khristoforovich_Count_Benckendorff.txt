Aleksandr Khristoforovich, Count Benckendorff,  (born 1783, Tallinn, Russia [now in Estonia]—died Sept. 23 [Oct. 5, New Style], 1844, St. Petersburg), general and statesman who played a prominent role in the Napoleonic Wars and later served as Tsar Nicholas I’s chief of police.
Of Baltic-German origin, Benckendorff joined the Russian army and was one of the officers who assassinated Emperor Paul I in 1801. Between 1806 and 1815 he fought in numerous military campaigns, distinguishing himself particularly when he became commandant of Moscow, joined the pursuit of the French forces as they fled from Russia (1812), and engaged in many battles against the French in Germany and the Low Countries and Belgium.
Benckendorff then served as aide-de-camp to Tsar Alexander I (1819–21) and, having been promoted to lieutenant general, was given command of the cuirassier division of the guards (1821). In 1825, when the liberal Decembrists attempted to prevent the succession of Nicholas to the throne and to force the establishment of constitutional government in Russia, Benckendorff commanded the troops that suppressed their uprising; later, he played a leading role in prosecuting them. The relentless way in which he and fellow generals of German origin in Russia tracked down members of eminent Russian noble families who had been connected with the Decembrist movement aroused popular belief that the German generals were trying to liquidate their Slav rivals in the government.
In January 1826 he submitted a plan to Nicholas for organizing a department of political police. When Nicholas then created the third section of the imperial chancellery, Benckendorff was placed in charge of both the gendarmerie and the third section, with responsibility for the work of regular and secret police, posts he held until his death.
