Ferdinand Kürnberger,  (born July 3, 1821, Vienna, Austria—died Oct. 14, 1879, Munich, Ger.), Austrian writer known for his participation in the Austrian revolution of 1848 and the Dresden rebellion of 1849.
Kürnberger was forced to leave Austria after his participation in the first rebellion and was jailed for his involvement in the second. He lived in Germany until 1864, when he became secretary for the Schiller Foundation, a position that he held for three years. He wrote many plays, the best known being Catilina (1855), as well as novels and critical essays. Among these works are Der Amerika-Müde (1855; “The One Who Is Tired of America”), a roman à clef about Nikolaus Lenau, a popular figure of the time; Der Haustyrann (1876; “The House Tyrant”); Das Schloss der Frevel (1904; “Frevel’s Castle”); and two books of essays, Siegelringe (1874; “Signet Rings”) and Literarische Herzenssachen (1877; “Literary Matters of the Heart”). His Gesammelte Werke (“Collected Works”) were published in 1910–11.
