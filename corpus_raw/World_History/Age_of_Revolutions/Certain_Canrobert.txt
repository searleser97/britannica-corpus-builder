Certain Canrobert, in full François-Certain Canrobert,  (born June 27, 1809, Saint-Céré, Fr.—died  Jan. 28, 1895, Paris), soldier and political figure who as a marshal of France (from 1856) was a supporter of Napoleon III.
A descendant of a long line of military officers, he attended the military academy at Saint-Cyr. After assignment on the Spanish frontier he requested transfer to Algeria, where he served with distinction (1835–51). He rose quickly in rank and won fame for his victory with the Zouaves at Zaatcha (1847) and for the taking of Constantine. He received the Legion of Honour in 1849.
Back in Paris in February 1851, Canrobert played a key role in the Bonapartist coup of Dec. 2, 1851, and Napoleon III rewarded him by making him a division general and his personal aide-de-camp. He became commander in chief of French forces in the Crimean War (September 1854). Though always courageous, he revealed an instinctive reluctance to assume responsibility. After some disagreements with the English commander, Lord Raglan, he was, by his own request, recalled to France.
Canrobert continued to be a leading military figure in the Second Empire. He distinguished himself in the Italian campaigns (1859–60), especially at the battles of Solferino and Magenta. In the Franco-German War (1870–71) he fought bravely at Saint-Privat but was taken prisoner at Metz. He returned to France in March 1871. After service on the Superior Council of War, he was elected in 1876 to the Senate, where he served for several years and was a leading advocate of the imperial restoration.
