Jacob Jones,  (born March 1768, Smyrna, Del.—died  Aug. 3, 1850, Philadelphia), U.S. naval officer who distinguished himself in the War of 1812.
After trying medicine and politics, Jones served in the undeclared U.S. naval war against France (1798–1800), as a midshipman, and in the Tripolitan War (1801–05), as a lieutenant.
In the War of 1812 Jones was commander of the sloop of war “Wasp,” which took the British sloop of war “Frolic” off Cape Hatteras (Oct. 18, 1812). Just as the battle ended, the British 74-gun “Poictiers” happened upon the scene and took both ships. When prisoners were exchanged a year later, Jones received a gold medal from Congress.
After the war Jones commanded the former British frigate “Macedonian” in the U.S. squadron that overawed the Barbary States at Algiers (1815). Later he commanded the Mediterranean Squadron (1821–23) and the Pacific Squadron (1826–29); stationed at Baltimore (1829–39) and at New York (1842–45), he was governor of the United States Naval Asylum in Philadelphia when he died.
