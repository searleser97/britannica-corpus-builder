Albrecht, count von Bernstorff,  (born March 22, 1809, Dreilützow, Mecklenburg [Germany]—died  March 26, 1873, London, Eng.), Prussian statesman known for his charm and diplomatic skill.
A widely traveled career diplomat, Bernstorff was dispatched to Vienna during the Revolution of 1848 and quickly distinguished himself as a conservative opponent of the then current schemes for German unification. Gradually, however, he came to accept the idea of German unity, though under Prussian rather than Austrian leadership. Bernstorff’s subsequent opposition to the German policy of the Austrian prime minister, Prince Felix zu Schwarzenberg, prompted his diplomatic recall. Sent to head the Prussian embassy in London shortly before the outbreak of the Crimean War (1854–56), he enlisted his considerable charm to promote good Anglo-Prussian relations.
In 1861 Bernstorff left his London post to become Prussia’s foreign minister, but his designs for a Prussian-led German union were undercut by the mistrust of both liberal and conservative elements. Displaced from his ministry by Otto von Bismarck in 1862, he thereafter repeatedly criticized the Machiavellian policies of his successor. Bernstorff soon was reassigned to the London embassy, where he remained as Prussian (and, after 1871, as German imperial) ambassador until his death.
