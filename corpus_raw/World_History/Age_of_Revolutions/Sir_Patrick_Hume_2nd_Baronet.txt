Sir Patrick Hume, 2nd Baronet, Hume also spelled Home, also called (1690–97) Lord Polwarth or (from 1697) 1st earl of Marchmont,  (born Jan. 13, 1641—died Aug. 1, 1724, Berwick-on-Tweed, Northumberland, Eng.), Scottish Protestant opponent of James II, who was involved in the rebellion of the duke of Monmouth and the invasion of William of Orange.
As a member of the Scottish Parliament in 1665, he was active in opposing the harsh policy of the earl of Lauderdale toward the Covenanters, and for his contumacy he was imprisoned. After his release he went to London, where he associated himself with the duke of Monmouth. Suspected of complicity in the Rye House Plot, he remained for a time in hiding and then crossed over to the Netherlands, where he took part in the deliberations of Monmouth, the earl of Argyll, and other exiles about the projected invasion of Great Britain. Although he appeared to distrust Argyll, he sailed to Scotland with him in 1685, and after the failure of the rising he escaped to Utrecht, where he lived in great poverty until 1688.
He accompanied William of Orange to England, and in 1689 he was again a member of the Scottish Parliament. In 1690 he was made a peer as Lord Polwarth; in 1696 he became lord high chancellor of Scotland, and in 1697 he was created earl of Marchmont. When Anne became queen in 1702, he was deprived of the chancellorship and later retired from politics.
