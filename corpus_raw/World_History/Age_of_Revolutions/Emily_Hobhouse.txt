Emily Hobhouse,  (born April 9, 1860, near Liskeard, Cornwall, Eng.—died  June 8, 1926, London), English reformer and social worker whose humanitarian undertakings in South Africa caused her to be dubbed the “Angel of Love” by grateful Boer women.
Hobhouse spent the first sheltered 35 years of her life at her father’s rectory. Upon his death, she engaged in temperance work in the United States. At the outbreak of the South African War in 1899, she became an outspoken critic of British policy. And when she learned of the high mortality rate of Boer women and children in British concentration camps, she went to South Africa (December 1900) to discover the facts for herself. Her investigations led to a storm of indignation in England. An amelioration of conditions soon followed. A second visit (October 1901) led to her deportation. Nonetheless, Hobhouse returned in 1903 and spent the next five years shaping the education of women and girls in the Orange River Colony (now Free State province).
During World War I she took up further relief work with the destitute and war-ravaged peoples of central Europe, continuing her work after the war until ill health forced her to retire. After her death in London, her cremated remains were interred at the foot of the Women and Children’s Memorial in Bloemfontein.
