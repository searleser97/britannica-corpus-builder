Mikhail Bogdanovich, Prince Barclay de Tolly,  (born December 13 [December 24, New Style], 1761, Pamuskis, Poland-Lithuania [now Zeimys, Lithuania]—died May 14 [May 26], 1818, Insterburg, East Prussia [now Chernyakhovsk, Russia]), Russian field marshal who was prominent in the Napoleonic Wars.
Barclay was a member of a Scottish family that had settled in Livonia in the 17th century. Enlisting in the ranks of the Russian army in 1776, he served against Turkey (1788–89) as a noncommissioned officer before his superiors recognized his merit. He then fought as an officer against Sweden (1790) and Poland (1792–94). In the campaign of 1806–07 against Napoleon, Barclay distinguished himself in the Battle of Pultusk and was wounded in the Battle of Eylau, after which he was made lieutenant general. In 1808–09 he commanded Russian forces against the Swedes in Finland. From 1810 to 1812 he was Russian minister of war.
In 1812 Barclay also took command of one of two Russian armies operating against Napoleon. His strategy of avoiding decisive action and retreating into Russia proved unpopular, and he was forced to resign his command in favour of General M.I. Kutuzov, who followed the same strategy.
Barclay was present at the Battle of Borodino, left the army soon afterward, and was recalled in 1813 for service in Germany. After the Battle of Bautzen he was made commander in chief of the Russian forces, and after the Battle of Leipzig he received the title of count from the emperor Alexander I. Barclay took part in the invasion of France in 1814 and while in Paris was promoted to field marshal. In 1815 he was commander in chief of the Russian army that invaded France after Napoleon’s return from Elba. He was made a prince at the end of that campaign.
