Sir John Moore,  (born Nov. 13, 1761, Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scot.—died  Jan. 16, 1809, La Coruña, Spain), British lieutenant general who led a famous retreat to La Coruña (December 1808–January 1809) during the Napoleonic Peninsular War. His actions became celebrated, criticized by some and praised by others (including the Duke of Wellington).
The son of a physician and the stepson of the Duke of Argyll, Moore obtained a seat in Parliament (1784–90) and a command in the British army upon the outbreak of war with France (1793). He served in Corsica, the West Indies, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Egypt. He was knighted in 1804. While commanding a corps at Shorncliffe Camp, Kent (1803–06), Moore earned a reputation as one of the greatest trainers of infantrymen in military history. He then served in the Mediterranean command and in Sweden.
Sent to Portugal in 1808, he succeeded to the command of the British army in September with instructions to assist in the expulsion of the French from Spain. He soon determined that the Spanish forces were beaten and that a retreat to Portugal was prudent. Nevertheless, urged on, he moved north from Salamanca to attack Marshal Nicolas Soult’s French corps on the Carrión River, west of Burgos. Learning that Napoleon had cut off his route of withdrawal into Portugal, he led his forces over 250 miles (400 km) of snowclad country to his shipping at La Coruña. In the Battle of La Coruña (Jan. 16, 1809), Moore died of his wounds after the French had been repulsed. “I hope my country will do me justice,” he said. These hopes were not fulfilled; he was widely excoriated for retreating. But, in fact, he had secured a strategic victory; the French conquest of Spain was delayed for a year, and Napoleon never again personally intervened in the Spanish theatre.
Charles Wolfe’s elegiac poem “The Burial of Sir John Moore” appeared in 1817.
