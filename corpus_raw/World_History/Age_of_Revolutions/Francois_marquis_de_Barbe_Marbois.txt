François, marquis de Barbé-Marbois,  (born January 31, 1745, Metz, France—died January 14, 1837, Paris), French statesman who in 1803 negotiated the Louisiana Purchase by the United States.
After serving as a diplomat in Germany and with the American colonists, Barbé-Marbois was an intendant of Santo Domingo (1785–89). Returning to France, he became a deputy in the Council of Ancients (1795–97) but was exiled later as a monarchist to French Guiana (1797–99). Recalled to France in 1800, he became minister of the treasury and, as such, negotiated the sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States, getting a better price than had been expected.
Napoleon dismissed Barbé-Marbois in 1806 because his excessive advances to contractors in 1805 had caused a grave financial crisis. He was, however, appointed first president of the Cour des Comptes (an administrative court handling public accounts of the country) in 1808 and was made a senator and a count in 1813. When Napoleon’s fall became likely, Barbé-Marbois hastily and successfully attached himself to the Bourbons and was made a peer of France (1814), a minister of justice (1815–16), a marquis (1817), and again president of the Cour des Comptes (1816–34). In 1834 he switched his loyalties to the July Monarchy of 1830.
