Pierre-Antoine, Count Daru,  (born January 12, 1767, Montpellier, France—died September 5, 1829, Meulan), French military administrator and organizer during the Napoleonic period.
Daru entered the military administration in 1784, served the revolutionary governments, and in January 1795 was called to the war ministry in Paris. His conspicuous administrative talents led to a continuous succession of advancements: secretary-general of the war ministry (1800), imperial councillor of state (1805), intendant general of the Grand Army (1806), and minister of war (1811). He apparently enjoyed the complete confidence of Napoleon, who charged him with the administration of conquered Prussian and Austrian territories in 1807. Daru retired when Bonaparte was defeated in 1814 but returned to the imperial cause during the Hundred Days.
In 1806 Daru was elected to the Institut de France in recognition of his four-volume translation of the works of Horace (1804–05). During the restoration of the Bourbons, he served in the Chamber of Peers, where he opposed the reactionary policies of the ultra-royalists, but he devoted most of his energies to his historical and literary studies. In 1819 he published the seven-volume Histoire de la République de Venise (“History of the Republic of Venice”) and in 1826 the three-volume Histoire de la Bretagne (“History of Brittany”).
