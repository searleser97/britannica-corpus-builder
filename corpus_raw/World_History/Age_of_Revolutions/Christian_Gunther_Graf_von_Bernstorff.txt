Christian Günther, count von Bernstorff,  Danish Greve af Bernstorff,  (born April 3, 1769, Copenhagen, Denmark—died March 28, 1835, Berlin, Prussia [now Germany]), Danish diplomat who was foreign minister (1818–32) of Prussia and an architect of the German customs union (Zollverein).
The son of the diplomat Andreas Peter, Graf von Bernstorff, he served as Danish ambassador in Stockholm from 1794 to May 1797 and in June succeeded his father as foreign minister. In 1812 he was appointed Danish ambassador to Austria and strove to obtain favourable peace conditions for Denmark (which was allied with Napoleon) from the Allies. He was present at the signing of the Treaty of Paris in May 1814 and represented Denmark at the Congress of Vienna. In 1816 he became Danish ambassador to Berlin, and in 1818 he entered Prussian service at the invitation of Karl August, Fürst (prince) von Hardenberg.
Bernstorff attended the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (October 1818) as a Prussian diplomat and returned to Berlin that year as foreign minister. He was by nature opposed to the principles of the French Revolution, and as foreign minister he is accused of having subordinated the interests of Prussia to the European policy of Klemens, Fürst von Metternich, and the Holy Alliance. But, although he supported the Carlsbad Decrees (1819), the Vienna Final Act, and Metternich’s policy at the congresses of Laibach (Ljubljana, Slovenia), Troppau (Opava, Czech Republic), and Verona, Italy, he was also one of the founders of the Zollverein (1834), which became a source of Prussian economic influence in Germany. He supported Russia’s war against Turkey over the Greek question in 1828, and in the crisis of 1830 he did much to confine the troubles in Poland and Belgium to those countries.
