Christiaan Rudolf de Wet,  (born Oct. 7, 1854, Smithfield District, Orange Free State [now in South Africa]—died  Feb. 3, 1922, Dewetsdorp district, S.Af.), Boer soldier and statesman, regarded by Afrikaner nationalists as one of their greatest heroes. He won renown as commander in chief of the Orange Free State forces in the South African War (1899–1902) and was a leader in the Afrikaner rebellion of 1914.
As a young man de Wet saw action in the Sotho wars of the 1860s and again with the Transvaal Boers in their struggle for independence (1880–81). In peacetime, de Wet, though a reluctant politician, served in the Volksraad (parliament) of the Transvaal and later in that of the Orange Free State.
At the beginning of the South African War, he headed a militia unit, and his military ingenuity and daring soon led to his appointment as commander in chief of the Orange Free State forces. With British troops in possession of much of his country, de Wet switched to hit-and-run guerrilla tactics. His military feats and miraculous escapes became legendary. It was with considerable reluctance that he surrendered, and, as acting president of the Orange Free State for one day, he signed the Peace of Vereeniging (May 1902).
From 1907 to 1910 de Wet served as minister of agriculture in the Orange Free State and participated in the convention (1908–09) that framed the constitution of the Union of South Africa. After the split between Prime Minister Louis Botha and J.B.M. Hertzog, de Wet joined Hertzog in founding the National Party (1914). The breach was widened with the outbreak of World War I, when de Wet opposed Botha’s decision to conquer German South West Africa (now Namibia). De Wet’s efforts to organize a rebellion led to his capture (December 1914) and a sentence of six years in prison for treason. After serving a year, however, he was released and allowed to live quietly on his farm.
