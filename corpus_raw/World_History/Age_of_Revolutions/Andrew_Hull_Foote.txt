Andrew Foote, original name Andrew Hull Foot,  (born Sept. 12, 1806, New Haven, Conn., U.S.—died  June 26, 1863, New York, N.Y.), American naval officer especially noted for his service during the American Civil War.
The son of a U.S. senator and governor of Connecticut, Foote was appointed a midshipman in the U.S. Navy in 1822. He rose through the ranks, eventually commanding the Perry off the African coast. While in that command he was particularly zealous in apprehending slavers; his book, Africa and the American Flag (1854), is considered to have influenced public opinion away from traffic in slaves. In 1856–58 Foote commanded the Portsmouth. Sailing the Asian seas in that capacity, Foote became embroiled in hostilities between England and China and, after being fired upon, led a party of seamen in the destruction of four Cantonese barrier forts.
In August 1861, at the outset of the Civil War, Foote was put in charge of naval defense on the upper Mississippi River. He oversaw the outfitting of a flotilla that included three wooden paddleboats converted into gunboats and 7 newly commissioned ironclad gunboats, as well as a number of smaller and partially armoured gunboats. The following February, he and his command sailed on the Tennessee River to Fort Henry, which he captured easily on February 6, and then (February 12–16) down the Cumberland River to Fort Donelson. There the flotilla was heavily damaged, and Foote sustained injuries. He went on to help capture Island Number Ten (about 55 miles [88 km] below Cairo, Ill.), in the Mississippi, but his injuries and additional ailments soon forced him to relinquish all but nominal command. He was promoted to rear admiral on July 16. In June of the following year he was once again appointed to the command of a squadron of ships, this time near Charleston, but he died before he could take up the position.
