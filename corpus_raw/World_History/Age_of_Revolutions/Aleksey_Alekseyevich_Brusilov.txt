Aleksey Alekseyevich Brusilov,  (born Aug. 31 [Aug. 19, Old Style], 1853, Tiflis, Russia—died March 17, 1926, Moscow), Russian general distinguished for the “Brusilov breakthrough” on the Eastern Front against Austria-Hungary (June–August 1916), which aided Russia’s Western allies at a crucial time during World War I.
Brusilov was educated in the Imperial Corps of Pages, and he began his military career as a cavalry officer in the Caucasus. He distinguished himself in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and was promoted to the rank of general in 1906. Upon the outbreak of World War I, Brusilov was given command of the Russian 8th Army, and he played a brilliant part in the Russian campaign in Galicia (autumn 1914).
In the spring of 1916 Brusilov succeeded the elderly and irresolute general N.Y. Ivanov as commander of the four Russian armies on the southwest sector of the Eastern Front. From June 4, 1916, Brusilov led these armies, who were billeted south of the Pripet Marshes, in a massive attack against the Austro-Hungarian forces. Though they suffered heavy losses, Brusilov’s forces by August had taken 375,000 Austrian prisoners (200,000 in the first three days of the offensive) and had overrun all of Bukovina and part of eastern Galicia. Largely because of this offensive, Germany was forced to divert troops that might have sufficed to secure a final victory against the French in the Battle of Verdun. The offensive had other beneficial effects for the Allies. Romania decided to enter the war on their side, and Austria had to abandon its assault in northern Italy. Brusilov’s offensive produced no decisive results on the Eastern Front itself, however.
Brusilov served briefly as commander-in-chief of the Russian armies from May 22 to July 19 (O.S. [June 4 to Aug. 1, N.S.]), 1917. Under the Bolshevik government he served as a military consultant and an inspector of cavalry from 1920 to 1924, after which he retired. His memoirs of World War I were translated in 1930 as A Soldier’s Note-Book, 1914–1918.
