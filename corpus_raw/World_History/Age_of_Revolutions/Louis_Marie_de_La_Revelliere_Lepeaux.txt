Louis-Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux,  (born Aug. 25, 1753, Montaigu, Fr.—died  March 27, 1824, Paris), member of the French Revolutionary regime known as the Directory.
In 1789 La Révellière-Lépeaux was elected as a representative of the Third Estate (the unprivileged order) to the States General, which converted itself into the revolutionary National Assembly. In 1792 he became a member of the Convention, the new national assembly that governed France from 1792 to 1795. During the Terror of 1793–94, La Révellière-Lépeaux went into hiding, but after the fall of Robespierre he returned to the Convention and was appointed to the commission that drew up the Constitution of 1795. He served as president of the Convention and then as a member of the five-man Directory (1795–99). His policy was marked by a bitter hostility to the Christian religion, which he proposed to supplant with a deistic system. He was forced off the Directory on June 18, 1799, and thenceforth stayed out of politics, refusing to swear allegiance to Napoleon in 1804. After Napoleon’s fall in 1814 La Révellière-Lépeaux was not banished by the royalist regime, even though as a member of the Convention he had voted for the execution of Louis XVI in 1793. His memoirs were published in 1873.
