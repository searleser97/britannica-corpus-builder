François-Séverin Marceau, in full François-Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers,  (born March 1, 1769, Chartres, France—died September 21, 1796, Altenkirchen, Rhenish Palatinate [Germany]), French general, a notable young military hero of the early years of the French Revolutionary wars.
A lawyer’s son, Marceau ran away to enlist in the infantry regiment of Savoy-Carignan in 1785 and took part in the attack on the Bastille in Paris in 1789. He joined the Chartres volunteers, who elected him lieutenant colonel, and they went to the Verdun garrison in the summer of 1792, but he left them in the disorder following capitulation to the Prussians on September 2. He obtained a cavalry captaincy when fighting the rebels of the Vendée in May 1793. A month later, in battle at Saumur, he again distinguished himself and was cited in the Convention and promoted. He was made a general at the Battle of Cholet on October 16, 1793, and temporarily the commander in chief (November 27). Marceau’s attractive heroism, guided by Jean-Baptiste Kléber’s maturer talents, led to decisive victory over the Vendéan “grand army” in December.
Marceau was received with acclaim by the Convention in February 1794 and given a division in the Ardennes against the Austrians. His capture of Koblenz, the former capital of the émigrés, gave special pleasure in Paris (October 1794). In 1795 he was across the Rhine with Kléber; he then led a wing of 17,000 men west of the Rhine facing Mainz and held an exposed flank with prudence and skill. In 1796, when Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and the main army retreated, Marceau’s corps was the all-important rear guard. In action at Altenkirchen on the Lahn River, Marceau was shot by a Tirolese sharpshooter.
