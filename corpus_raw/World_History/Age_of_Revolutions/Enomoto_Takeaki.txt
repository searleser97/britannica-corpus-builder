Enomoto Takeaki, also called Enomoto Buyo,  (born October 5, 1836, Edo, Japan—died October 26, 1908, Tokyo), Japanese naval officer and statesman who was the last supporter of the Tokugawa family—which ruled Japan for 264 years—to capitulate to the forces that favoured the restoration of power to the emperor.
In 1868, as the fighting to end the long domination of the nation by the Tokugawa family neared a close, Enomoto took eight ships of the Tokugawa navy to Hokkaido, the northernmost Japanese island, with the intention of making it an independent republic. He surrendered to imperial forces in 1869, after which he spent three years under house arrest. Restored to favour, Enomoto later held many important ministerial positions with the government of the Meiji emperor. As envoy extraordinary to Russia (1873–76), he concluded the Treaty of St. Petersburg, by which Japan gave up its claim to Sakhalin Island in exchange for the northern Kurils. He next served as navy minister (1876–82) and was minister to China (1882–84). He subsequently held the portfolios of communications, education, foreign affairs, agriculture, and commerce. He was created viscount in 1887.
