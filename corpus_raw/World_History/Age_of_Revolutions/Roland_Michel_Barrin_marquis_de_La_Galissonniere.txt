Roland-Michel Barrin, marquis de La Galissonnière, also spelled Roland-Michel Barin, marquis de La Galissonière,  (born Nov. 10, 1693, Rochefort, France—died  Oct. 26, 1756, Montereau), mariner and commandant general of New France.
La Galissonnière was the son of a naval lieutenant-general and studied at the College of Beauvais in Paris. He became a midshipman in the French navy in 1710 and, in the following year, made the first of a number of voyages on the Héros carrying supplies to Canada. Some 26 years later he commanded the same vessel in the same trade, having earlier (1734–35) served as lieutenant commander in a West Indies campaign.
Through family influence, La Galissonnière was made captain and a knight of the Order of St. Louis in 1738. Subsequently he held a variety of commands in the Atlantic and in 1747 was named commandant general of New France—in effect, governor-general of Canada. War with the British over North American holdings had been under way for three years, and La Galissonnière, like his predecessors, sought to build and keep goodwill among the First Nation tribes allied to France. It was his hope to fortify a link along the Ohio River between French Canada and the Louisiana settlements, but the British presence in much of the projected link was too great. La Galissonnière also tried to establish French settlements in Detroit and the Illinois country, but the Canadian population was too sparse to enable sending colonists in any substantial numbers.
Upon his return to France in 1749, La Galissonnière served in Paris as a commissioner to the conference seeking to resolve the French disputes with the English over colonizing North America. He became a rear admiral in 1750, and in 1754 he was given command of a naval squadron operating to protect French shipping from the Barbary pirates. The following year he was elevated to lieutenant general of naval forces.
