Andersonville National Historic Site,  Confederate military prison for captured Union soldiers during the American Civil War, located in Andersonville, southwest-central Georgia, U.S. It was established as a national historic site in 1970 to honour all U.S. prisoners of war. The site preserves the camp area and its environs and includes Andersonville National Cemetery, containing some 18,000 graves, including those of prisoners who died at the camp. The cemetery continues to be used as a burial site for U.S. military veterans. The U.S. National Park Service has conducted archaeological excavations at the site, and a portion of the original stockade wall has been reconstructed. The National Prisoner of War Memorial Museum opened there in 1998.
