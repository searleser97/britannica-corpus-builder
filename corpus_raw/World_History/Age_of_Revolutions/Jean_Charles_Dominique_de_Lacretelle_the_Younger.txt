Jean-Charles-Dominique de Lacretelle, the Younger,  (born Sept. 3, 1766, Metz, France—died March 26, 1855, Mâcon), French historian and journalist, a pioneer in the historical study of the French Revolution.
Summoned in 1787 to Paris by his older brother Pierre, a lawyer and political activist, he became a member of the Feuillants, a party advocating a constitutional monarchy. He wrote for the Journal des Débats and the Journal de Paris, and, when he made no attempt to hide his monarchist sympathies in reporting the trial and death of Louis XVI (1792–93), his life was imperiled. He enlisted in the army for refuge but soon returned to Paris. There he became involved in the Royalist movement of 13 Vendémiaire (Oct. 5, 1795) and was condemned to deportation after the coup against the constitutional monarchists on 18 Fructidor (Sept. 4, 1797). Powerful sympathizers arranged for him to stay conveniently forgotten in prison until after the consulate under Napoleon came to power on Nov. 9, 1799, when he was set free. Under the empire, he began his historical writings and taught at the Faculté des Lettres in Paris. As censeur royal, he opposed proposed restrictions on the press (1827), causing both the defeat of the measure and his own removal from office.
Lacretelle’s chief works, written with accurate information but lacking the insight and style of a great historian, are a series of histories, including Précis historique de la Révolution française, 5 vol. (1801–06; “A Short History of the French Revolution”); Histoire de France pendant le XVIIIe siècle, 6 vol. (1808; “French History During the 18th Century”); and Histoire de France depuis la restauration (1829–35; “History of France Since the Restoration”).
