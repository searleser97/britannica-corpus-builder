John Barry,  (born 1745, County Wexford, Ireland—died  September 13, 1803, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American naval officer who won significant maritime victories during the American Revolution (1775–83). Because he trained so many young officers who later became celebrated in the nation’s history, he was often called the “Father of the Navy.”
A merchant shipmaster out of Philadelphia at the age of 21, Barry outfitted the first Continental fleet at the outbreak of the Revolution. Commissioned captain of the brig Lexington in 1776, he early distinguished himself by capturing the British tender Edward after a short engagement. He fought with distinction in the campaign around Trenton, New Jersey (1776), and was then commissioned captain of the frigate Effingham, which he was forced to scuttle to avoid capture by the British.
In the winter of 1777–78 Barry commanded a spectacular boat foray that ran the British batteries at Philadelphia and raided enemy shipping in the Delaware River and Bay. Next commanding the frigate Raleigh out of Boston, he fought a vigorous but futile battle against superior enemy forces but managed to save most of his crew from capture. Commanding the frigate Alliance in 1780, he was assigned to convey Colonel John Laurens on a diplomatic mission to France. En route he took several prizes and in returning engaged in a notable battle with two British sloops of war, eventually subduing them.
On the final cruise of the Alliance (beginning in 1782), Barry ranged the shipping lanes from Bermuda to Cape Sable and captured four British ships. He fought the last battle of the war (March 1783) in the Straits of Florida, where he beat off three British frigates seeking to intercept him.
After the war Barry was recalled to active service as senior captain of the new U.S. Navy. In the quasi-war with France (1798–1800), he was twice in command of all U.S. ships in the West Indies. By the end of his career he was senior officer of the navy.
