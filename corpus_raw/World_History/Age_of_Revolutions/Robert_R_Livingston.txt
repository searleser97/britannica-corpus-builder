Robert R. Livingston,  (born Nov. 27, 1746, New York, N.Y. [U.S.]—died  Feb. 26, 1813, Clermont, N.Y.), early American leader who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, first secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs (1781–83), and minister to France (1801–04).
Born into a wealthy and influential New York family, Livingston was admitted to the bar in 1770. Devoted to the idea of independence from Britain, he worked on numerous committees of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia (1775–76, 1779–81, 1784–85), especially in the areas of finance and foreign and judicial affairs. He was a member of the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence, and, after helping to draft New York state’s first constitution (1777), he served as the state’s first chancellor, a judicial office (1777–1801).
With the inauguration of the federal government under the Articles of Confederation (1781), Livingston was appointed secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in which post he established vital administrative precedents and organized the conduct of foreign affairs on a businesslike basis. He insisted on greater independence for American delegates to the Paris Peace Conference (1782–83) but reprimanded them for negotiating without the full concurrence of France.
On April 30, 1789, under the new Constitution, Chancellor Livingston administered the oath of office in New York City to the nation’s first president, George Washington. During the 1790s he gradually associated himself with the anti-Federalists and in 1801 was appointed by President Thomas Jefferson to represent the United States in France. In that capacity he rendered his most distinguished service by helping effect the Louisiana Purchase (1803)—one of the country’s greatest diplomatic coups.
In retirement Livingston became enthusiastically involved with steam-navigation experiments, and in partnership with the inventor Robert Fulton, he received a steamboat monopoly in New York waters. Their first successful steam vessel, operating on the Hudson River in 1807, was named the Clermont after Livingston’s ancestral home.
