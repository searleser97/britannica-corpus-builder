Margaret Corbin, née Margaret Cochran,  (born November 12, 1751, western Pennsylvania [now Franklin county, Pennsylvania, U.S.]—died January 16, 1800, Westchester county, New York, U.S.), American Revolutionary War heroine whose valour and sacrifice were recognized by the new United States government.
Margaret Cochran, having lost both her parents in an Indian raid when she was five, grew up with relatives and, in 1772, married John Corbin. When he enlisted in the First Company of Pennsylvania Artillery for service in the American Revolution, she followed him east. (According to some historians, she held a paid position as an enlisted soldier.) On November 16, 1776, Corbin was manning a gun on a ridge near Fort Washington, New York, when he was killed during a Hessian advance. Observing from nearby, Margaret immediately leaped to the gun and continued to serve in her husband’s stead until she was felled by grapeshot wounds. Upon the surrender of the American position she was not taken among the prisoners. She made her way to Philadelphia and there, completely disabled, came to the attention of the state’s Executive Council, by which she was granted temporary relief in June 1779. The next month the Continental Congress approved the granting of a lifetime soldier’s half-pay pension to her. She was thereafter included on military rolls and in April 1783 was formally mustered out of the Continental Army. She lived in Westchester county, New York, until her death. Her story has sometimes been confused with that of Mary McCauley (“Molly Pitcher”).
