Charles-Denis-Sauter Bourbaki,  (born April 22, 1816, Pau, France—died  Sept. 23, 1897, Bayonne), French general who served with distinction in Algeria, the Crimean War, and the Franco-German War.
Bourbaki was the son of a colonel who lost his life in the War of Greek Independence. After studying at the military school at La Flèche and at Saint Cyr (1834–36), Bourbaki joined the Zouaves in Algeria. He showed considerable valour in battle, notably at Sétif (1840), and in 1842 was promoted to captain. After a brief period in 1845 as aide-de-camp to King Louis-Philippe, he went back to Algeria to take charge of the Arab bureau at Blidah. In 1851 he was colonel of the Zouaves. During the Crimean War he fought with great bravery at the Battle of the Alma and was promoted to brigadier general. Wounded during the capturing of Sevastopol, he returned once more to Algeria, becoming a general of division in 1857.
Bourbaki took part in the campaign in Italy in 1859 and assumed command of the 2nd Division in Grenoble in 1860. Appointed aide-de-camp to Napoleon III in 1869, he commanded the imperial guard in 1870 and was engaged in the fighting around Metz after the outbreak of the Franco-German War. Sent by Marshal A.F. Bazaine to England to negotiate with the empress Eugénie, he was afterward unable to return to Metz and offered his services to the provisional government at Tours. In October 1870 he was put in command of the Army of the North but was subsequently transferred to the Army of the East. Having won a victory over the Germans at Villersexel (Jan. 9, 1871), he tried to break through the German lines and to raise the siege of Belfort but after three days’ fighting suffered a severe repulse before Héricourt. Without munitions, lacking sufficient food supplies, and leading an exhausted army, Bourbaki was incapable of action. On January 26 he attempted to commit suicide and was replaced by General C. Clinchant.
After the war Bourbaki commanded the 14th Corps and was governor of Lyons. Placed on the reserve in 1881, he twice tried unsuccessfully to enter parliament.
