Fujita Tōko,  (born May 3, 1806, Mito, Japan—died  Nov. 11, 1855, Edo [Tokyo]), one of the Japanese scholars who inspired the movement that in 1868 overthrew the feudal Tokugawa shogunate, restored direct rule to the emperor, and attempted to strengthen Japan to meet the challenge of Western imperialist powers.
Born into a high samurai family, Fujita succeeded his father in 1827 as the director of the Shōkōkan, the history-compiling institute of the great feudal fief of Mito. He helped Tokugawa Nariaki succeed as daimyo, or lord, of Mito in 1829 and, two years later, accompanied Nariaki to Edo and advised the shogunate to strengthen Japan’s defenses and to ban any intercourse or trade with foreign powers. Such views later influenced those coalescing against the shogunate under the slogan “Revere the Emperor; Expel the Barbarians”.
Fujita returned to Mito in 1841 and helped strengthen the fief’s defenses, an activity that alarmed the shogunate and led to the confinement of Nariaki and Fujita in 1844. Fujita put the time to good use by writing his two-volume Kōdōkanki jutsugi (1849), setting forth his views of Japan’s unique destiny.
Fujita returned to active politics in 1853, when the shogunate invited Nariaki to advise on defense and diplomatic problems posed by the arrival of a U.S. naval squadron under Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who demanded that Japan end its two centuries of isolation and open trade with the rest of the world. Fujita’s exposure to the negotiations with the Americans brought him to the view that concluding treaties with the Western powers would be inevitable. Shortly afterward, he was killed when his house collapsed during an earthquake.
