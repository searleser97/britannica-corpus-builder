August Karl von Goeben,   (born Dec. 10, 1816, Hannover, Hanover—died  Nov. 13, 1880, Coblenz, Prussian Rhine Province), a victorious and exceptionally able Prussian general in the wars of 1864, 1866, and 1870–71.
About 1848, while a staff officer, Goeben formed a lasting friendship with Helmuth von Moltke, future chief of the Prussian and imperial German general staffs. In 1860 he served with Spanish troops in Morocco and was present at the Battle of Tetuán; he wrote two books, published in 1841 and 1863, on his Spanish experiences.
By 1863 Goeben was a major general. In the war against Denmark in 1864, he distinguished himself as a brigade commander. In the Seven Weeks’ War against Austria and its allies (1866), he commanded a division in the campaign against Bavarian forces around Würzburg.
In 1870 Goeben successfully commanded the VIII (Rhineland) Corps against the French in the battles of Spicheren and Gravelotte (August 6 and 18). On Jan. 8, 1871, he succeeded Edwin von Manteuffel in command of the Prussian 1st Army and soon (January 18–19) brought the war in northern France to an end by his victory at Saint-Quentin. At his death he was once more commander of the VIII Corps. Goeben wrote Vier Jahre in Spanien (1841; “Four Years in Spain”) and Reise- und Lager-Briefe aus Spanien und vom spanischen Heere in Marokko (1863; “Travel and Camp Letters from Spain and from the Spanish Army in Morocco”).
