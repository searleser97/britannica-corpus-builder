John Morgan,  (born June 10, 1735, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania [U.S.]—died  October 15, 1789, Philadelphia), pioneer of American medical education, surgeon general of the Continental armies during the American Revolution, and founder of the first medical school in the United States.
Morgan studied at the University of Edinburgh (M.D., 1763), at Paris, and in Italy. Returning to the colonies in 1765, he founded their first medical school at the College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania) and there was appointed North America’s first professor of medicine. His policies of requiring a liberal education for medical students and the separation of medicine, surgery, and pharmacology into distinct disciplines, outlined in his Discourse upon the Institution of Medical Schools in America (1765), met with widespread opposition from colonial physicians and failed to gain acceptance.
Upon the start of the American Revolution, Morgan became an ardent patriot and was appointed “Director-General to the Military Hospitals and Physician-in-Chief to the American Army” by the Continental Congress in 1775. Morgan tried to bring the nearly autonomous regimental surgeons under general army control, but Congress would not reorganize the system. A faction headed by William Shippen, Jr., sought to oust him from office, and in 1777 Morgan was held responsible for the high mortality rate in the army and was dismissed from his post by Congress.
Two years later Morgan was absolved of all wrongdoing both by President George Washington and by the Congress, but he never recovered from his disgrace and died an impoverished recluse 10 years later. Morgan also wrote A Recommendation of Inoculation (1776).
