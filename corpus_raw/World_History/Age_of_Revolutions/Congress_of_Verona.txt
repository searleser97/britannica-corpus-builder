Congress of Verona,  (Oct. 20–Dec. 14, 1822), the last of the meetings held by the European powers in accordance with the terms of the Quadruple Alliance (1815) between Russia, Prussia, Austria, and Great Britain. Held at Verona, the congress was also the last effective manifestation of the Holy Alliance (Austria, Russia, Prussia). It was held mainly to consider the revolutionary situation in Spain. Convened because the French king Louis XVIII wanted his allies’ consent to intervene in Spain to overthrow the constitutional regime established there in 1820, the congress agreed to support France if it should be attacked by Spain and authorized a French expedition into Spain (1823). The British, however, by threatening the use of their sea power, prevented the allies from interfering with the revolts occurring in Spanish America and created enough discord among the allies to cause a breakdown in the congress system.
