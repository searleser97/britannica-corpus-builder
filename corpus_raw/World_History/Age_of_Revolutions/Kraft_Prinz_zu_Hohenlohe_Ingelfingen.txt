Kraft, prince zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen,  (born Jan. 2, 1827, Koschentin, Prussian Upper Silesia—died Jan. 16, 1892, Dresden, Ger.), Prussian army officer and military writer.
The son of Adolf, Prinz zu Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen, he joined the Prussian Guard Artillery in 1845. During the Seven Weeks’ War, Hohenlohe led the Guard Artillery with great success against the Austrian Corps right wing in the decisive Prussian victory of Königgrätz or Sadowa (July 3, 1866).
After the war he turned his energies toward improving the tactical training of the Prussian artillery. In 1868 he was promoted to major general and assigned to command the Guard Artillery Brigade. In this capacity he served in the Franco-German War (1870–71), distinguishing himself at Gravelotte and Sedan, and directing the artillery attack on the Paris fortifications. He retired in 1879.
Hohenlohe’s memoirs, Aus meinem Leben, appeared in four volumes (1897–1908) and in a one-volume edition (1915).
