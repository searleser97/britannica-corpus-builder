Friedrich Hecker,  (born September 28, 1811, Eichtersheim, Baden—died March 24, 1881, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.), German revolutionary republican politician who led radical forces that demanded that the 1848 revolution establish a republican form of government in Germany.
A lawyer, Hecker in 1842 was elected to Baden’s second chamber, where he quickly established himself as the leader of the liberal opposition. He became a Democrat, and in the revolutionary Vorparlament (Preparliament) he attempted to turn that body into a permanent revolutionary peoples’ committee (1848), demanding the elimination of the monarchies. When the assembly majority decided to try to win Germany’s princes over to their new constitution, Hecker and the radicals walked out.
After a popular rising, fomented in Baden (spring 1849), was quickly crushed by Baden and Hessian troops, Hecker fled to Switzerland and the United States, where, during the U.S. Civil War (1861–65), he served as a colonel in the Union army. He revisited Germany several times, but, although he admired the new united German empire founded in 1871, he could never reconcile himself to its Prussian leadership.
