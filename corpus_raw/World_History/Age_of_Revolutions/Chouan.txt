Chouan,   member of any of the bands of peasants, chiefly smugglers and dealers in contraband salt, who rose in revolt in the west of France in 1793 and joined the Vendéan royalists (see Vendée, Wars of the). The Breton word chouan, meaning “screech owl,” is supposed to have been applied originally as a nickname to Jean Cottereau (1757–94), leader of the unsuccessful revolt, and afterward extended to his followers. 
The motive for revolt was less devotion to the monarchy than resentment at interference by the new republican government with the Chouans’ old habits, the ruin of their contraband trade by the abolition of the gabelle (a centuries-old tax on salt), government measures against the clergy, and the enforcement of conscription. The rebels are vividly described in Honoré de Balzac’s novel Les Chouans.
