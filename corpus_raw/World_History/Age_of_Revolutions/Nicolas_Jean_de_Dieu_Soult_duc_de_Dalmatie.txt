Nicolas-Jean de Dieu Soult, duke de Dalmatie,  (born March 29, 1769, Saint-Amans-la-Bastide, later Saint-Amans-Soult, Fr.—died  Nov. 26, 1851, Saint-Amans-Soult), French military leader and political figure who was noted for his courage in battle and his opportunism in politics.
Upon the death of his father in 1785, Soult enlisted in the infantry. At the outbreak of the French Revolution (1789–92), he was a sergeant at Strasbourg. He served under several commanders and was made a general by François-Joseph Lefebvre for his conduct in the Battle of Fleurus (June 1794). In March 1799 he replaced the wounded Lefebvre at the Battle of Stokach.
Soult built a reputation for vigour, boldness, and method. Under Napoleon he was put in charge of the southern part of the Kingdom of Naples (1800–02) and in 1804 was made a marshal of France. His reputation was further enhanced by his significant role in French victories at Ulm, Austerlitz, and Jena in 1805–06, though he was less successful in Poland at Eylau and Heilsberg (1807). Created duc de Dalmatie and sent to Spain late in 1808, he was soon put in charge of all French armies involved in the Peninsular War, where he was opposed by the English under Arthur Wellesley (later duke of Wellington). Soult remained in Spain for most of the next five years, but eventually Wellesley forced his outnumbered troops to retreat and defeated him at Toulouse (April 1814), four days after Napoleon had abdicated.
During the First Restoration (1814) Soult declared himself a royalist, but during Napoleon’s Hundred Days (1815) he again supported Bonaparte, acting as his chief of staff at Waterloo. Soult was exiled at the start of the Second Restoration (1815–30) but was recalled in 1819. Under King Louis-Philippe he presided over three ministries (October 1832–July 1834, May 1839–March 1840, and October 1840–September 1847) and was usually minister of war as well as president of the council; he was responsible for the French conquest of Algeria during the 1840s. In 1848, when Louis-Philippe was overthrown, Soult declared himself a republican. His Mémoires appeared in three volumes in 1854.
