Alexander Gardner,  (born Oct. 17, 1821, Paisley, Renfrew, Scot.—died  1882, Washington, D.C., U.S.), photographer of the American Civil War and of the American West during the latter part of the 19th century.
Gardner probably moved to the United States in 1856, when he was hired by the photographer Mathew B. Brady as a portrait photographer. Two years later, Gardner opened a portrait studio for Brady in Washington, D.C. It was so successful that it helped to support Brady’s more extravagant New York studio.
When the American Civil War erupted in 1861, Gardner assisted Brady in his effort to make a complete photographic record of the conflict. Brady, however, refused to give Gardner public credit for his work. Gardner therefore left Brady in 1863, opened a portrait gallery in Washington, and continued to photograph the hostilities on his own. His photographs President Lincoln on the Battlefield of Antietam (1862) and Home of a Rebel Sharpshooter, Gettysburg (1863) and his portraits of Abraham Lincoln are among the best-known photographs of the war period. Gardner’s Photographic Sketch Book of the Civil War, a two-volume collection of 100 original prints, was published in 1866. When Brady petitioned Congress to buy his photographs of the war, Gardner presented a rival petition, claiming that it was he, not Brady, who had originated the idea of providing the nation with a photographic history of the conflict. Congress eventually bought both collections.
In 1867 Gardner became the official photographer for the Union Pacific Railroad. Primarily active in Kansas, he photographed the building of the railroad and the new settlements that grew up near it. He also compiled valuable photographic documentation of the Plains Indians of North America. Returning to Washington, he gradually lost interest in photography and devoted the rest of his life to philanthropy.
