Claude Victor-Perrin, duke de Bellune, byname Claude Perrin,  (born Dec. 7, 1764, La Marche, Fr.—died  March 1, 1841, Paris), a leading French general of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, who was created marshal of France in 1807.
In 1781 he entered the army as a private soldier and, after 10 years’ service, received his discharge and settled at Valence. Soon afterward he joined the local volunteers, rising to the command of a battalion. He served at Toulon (1793), in the Italian campaign of 1796–97, in La Vendée, and then in Italy at Marengo. In 1802 he was governor of the colony of Louisiana for a short time; in 1803 he commanded the Batavian army, and in 1805–06 was French plenipotentiary at Copenhagen. On the outbreak of hostilities with Prussia he joined the V Army Corps as chief of the general staff. He distinguished himself at Saalfeld and Jena; and after Friedland, where he commanded the I Corps, Napoleon gave him the marshalate. After the Peace of Tilsit he became governor of Berlin, and in 1808 he was created duke of Belluno (Bellune). In the same year he was sent to Spain, where he took a prominent part in the Peninsular War (especially at Espinosa, Talavera, Barrosa, and Cádiz), until his appointment in 1812 to a corps command in the invasion of Russia. There his most important service was in protecting the retreating army at the crossing of the Beresina.
He took an active part in the wars of 1813–14, until in February of the latter year he had the misfortune to arrive too late at Montereau-sur-Yonne. The result was a scene of violent recrimination and his supersession by Napoleon, who relieved him of his command.
Victor-Perrin now transferred his allegiance to the Bourbons and in December 1814 received from Louis XVIII the command of the second military division. In 1815 he accompanied the King to Ghent, and on the Second Restoration he was made a peer of France. He was war minister in 1821–23. In 1830 he was major general of the royal guard, and after the revolution of that year he retired altogether into private life.
