François-Christophe Kellermann, duke de Valmy,   (born May 28, 1735, Strasbourg, Fr.—died  Sept. 23, 1820, Paris), French general whose defeat of a Prussian army at Valmy in September 1792 halted an invasion that threatened the Revolutionary regime in France.
Born into a family of the judicial nobility, Kellermann became an officer in the French Army in 1752. He fought with distinction against the Prussians and British during the Seven Years’ War (1756–63) and was subsequently sent on diplomatic missions to eastern Europe. Promoted to the rank of field marshal in 1788, Kellermann welcomed the outbreak of the Revolution in the following year. In March 1792 he was made a lieutenant general. He joined Charles-François du Périer Dumouriez, commander of the northern front, at Valmy on September 19; on the following day Kellermann defeated an invading Prussian army in an artillery duel. The Austrian and Prussian forces then retreated from French soil.
In November 1792 Kellermann was appointed commander of the Army of the Alps. He recaptured Savoy from the Sardinians in the autumn of 1793, but in November the Jacobin regime in Paris imprisoned him on suspicion of disloyalty. He was released shortly after the Jacobins fell from power in July 1794, and from 1795 to 1797 he again commanded the Army of the Alps. When Napoleon came to power in 1799, Kellermann was made a senator. He proved to be so able a military administrator that he was made marshal of France in 1804 and duc de Valmy four years later. Meanwhile, his son François-Étienne Kellermann (1770–1835) had become one of the finest cavalry officers in Napoleon’s army. After the Second Restoration of King Louis XVIII (1815), Kellermann sat in the Chamber of Peers.
