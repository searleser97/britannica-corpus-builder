Kōshaku Katsura Tarō,  (born January 4, 1848, Hagi, Nagato province, Japan—died October 10, 1913, Tokyo), Japanese army officer and statesman who served three times as prime minister of Japan.
Katsura fought for the imperial cause in the Meiji Restoration, which in 1868 wrested power from the feudal Tokugawa family and restored it to the emperor. He was later sent to Germany to study military strategy and tactics. He was appointed deputy army minister in 1886 and served in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95). As a protégé of Yamagata Aritomo—military leader, prime minister, and special adviser to the emperor—he became army minister in 1898 and prime minister in 1901 for the first of three successive terms. During his first premiership (1901–06) an alliance with Great Britain was concluded (1902) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) was successfully fought, making Japan a world power. Katsura, however, became increasingly the antagonist of Itō Hirobumi (the founder of the Rikken Seiyūkai political party) on policy toward Korea, which was then a Japanese protectorate. While Itō strove to moderate Japanese rule in Korea, Katsura favoured outright annexation, a goal he achieved in 1910, during his second term as prime minister (1908–11). He was in Europe in the summer of 1911 when he received word of the emperor Meiji’s illness. He hurried home and after Meiji’s death in 1912 entered the service of the new emperor, Taishō. Katsura was named lord keeper of the privy seal and grand chamberlain and was elevated to princely rank.
Although he had previously opposed the idea of political parties, during his third premiership (December 1912 to February 1913) he tried to counter Seiyūkai control of the Diet (parliament) by forming his own party. His Rikken Dōshikai was at first unsuccessful but eventually became one of the two major political groups in pre-World War II Japan. Katsura’s third premiership lasted only seven weeks (December 1912–February 1913) and ended amidst riots against his oligarchic methods and his program for greater armaments. He died a few months later.
