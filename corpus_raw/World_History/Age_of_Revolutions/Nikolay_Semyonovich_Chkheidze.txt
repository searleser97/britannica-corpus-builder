Nikolay Semyonovich Chkheidze,  (born 1864, Kutaisi, in the Caucasus, Russian Empire—died  June 13, 1926, Leuville-sur-Orge, France), Menshevik leader who played a prominent role in the revolutions of Russia (1917) and Georgia (1918).
Chkheidze, a schoolteacher who helped to introduce Marxism into Georgia in the 1890s, was elected to the Russian State Duma (legislature) in 1907. There he became the leader of the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social-Democratic Party and earned a reputation as a spokesman for extreme left-wing positions, including opposition to participation in World War I. In 1917, on the outbreak of the February (March, New Style) revolution, he became chairman of the Petrograd (St. Petersburg) Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, in which he vainly sought to conciliate the moderate and radical elements. His vacillations helped to discredit the original leadership of the soviet, which was soon swept away by the rising tide of Bolshevism. After the Bolsheviks seized power in October 1917, Chkheidze returned to Georgia and became president of the assembly that created the independent Transcaucasian Federal Republic (April 1918); when that republic disintegrated, he took part in the formation of the independent Republic of Georgia (May 1918). When the Bolsheviks overthrew the Menshevik regime in Georgia in 1921, he emigrated to France, where he later committed suicide.
