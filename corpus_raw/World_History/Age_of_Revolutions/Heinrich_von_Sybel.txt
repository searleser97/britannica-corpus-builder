Heinrich von Sybel,  (born Dec. 2, 1817, Dusseldorf, Rhine Province, Prussia—died  Aug. 1, 1895, Marburg, Ger.), German historian who departed from the dispassionate manner of his teacher Leopold von Ranke and made himself a spokesman of nationalistic political Prussianism.
While studying in Berlin (1834–38), he learned from Ranke the critical method of evaluating historical sources, and his first book, Geschichte des ersten Kreuzzugs (1841; The History and Literature of the Crusades, 1861) is among the most distinguished products of the Ranke school. His study of German kingship, Entstehung des deutschen Königtums (1844), is generally considered to be of the same group.
Sybel’s political interests soon separated him, at least academically, from Ranke, whose detachment he grew to despise as soulless respectability. He held professorial chairs at Marburg (1846), Munich (1856), and Bonn (1861), saying of himself that he was four-sevenths politician and three-sevenths professor, and he came to believe passionately in the historian’s vocation as teacher. His involvement in contemporary politics was consistent with these views. He sat in the Hessian Landtag (1848), the Erfurt Parliament (1850), the Prussian Landtag (1862–64; 1874–80), and the Prussian Constituent Assembly of 1867. A believer in Prussia’s mission to lead Germany toward unification, he was an enemy of ultramontanism and feudalism; he rejected medieval imperial policy and eventually came to support Otto von Bismarck.
Sybel’s political views are clear from his later books. His greatest work, Geschichte der Revolutionszeit von 1789 bis 1800, 5 vol. (1853–79; History of the French Revolution), which was particularly valuable for its connection of French domestic events with the wider European scene, showed vigorous opposition to revolutionary ideals. His last work, Die Begründung des deutschen Reiches durch Wilhelm I, 7 vol. (1889–94; The Founding of the German Empire by William I), for which Bismarck opened the state archives, is the first detailed account of the subject. It is somewhat marred, however, by a disregard of internal affairs and by excessive Prussianism.
In forming the Historische Zeitschrift in 1859 in Munich, Sybel provided the model for many other periodicals. In 1875 Bismarck appointed him director of the Prussian archives, and he began a great series of publications.
