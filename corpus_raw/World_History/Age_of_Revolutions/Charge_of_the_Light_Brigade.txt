Charge of the Light Brigade,  (Oct. 25 [Oct. 13, Old Style], 1854), disastrous British cavalry charge against heavily defended Russian troops at the Battle of Balaklava (1854) during the Crimean War (1853-56). The suicidal attack was made famous by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in his 1855 poem of the same name. Military historians and strategists continue to study the attack to underscore the importance of military intelligence and a clear chain of command and communication.  (For a more detailed discussion of the charge, see The Battle of Balaklava.)
