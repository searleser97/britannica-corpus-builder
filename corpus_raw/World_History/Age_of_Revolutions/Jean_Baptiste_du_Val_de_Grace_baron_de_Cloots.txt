Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grâce, baron de Cloots, pseudonym Anacharsis Cloots,  (born June 24, 1755, near Kleve, Brandenburg [Germany]—died March 24, 1794, Paris, France), radical democrat of the French Revolution who became a leading exponent of French expansionism in Europe.
Born into a noble Prussian family of Dutch origin, Cloots went to Paris in 1776 and took part in the compilation of Denis Diderot’s Encyclopédie. He left France in 1784, traveled throughout Europe, and returned to Paris at the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789. He quickly became an ardent democrat and a member of the Jacobin Club. As head of a delegation of 36 foreigners (his self-proclaimed “embassy of the human race”), he addressed the revolutionary National Assembly on June 17, 1791, declaring that the whole world adhered to the democratic ideals of the Revolution. He henceforth titled himself “The Orator of Mankind” and adopted the pseudonym “Anacharsis.”
He became a naturalized French citizen and in September 1792 was elected to the National Convention. There he advocated that France “liberate” the rest of Europe. The Convention backed his call for a revolutionary crusade, and France (already at war with Austria and Prussia) was soon at war with most of the European powers.
After the Jacobins took control of the government in June 1793, Cloots identified himself with the Jacobins’ left wing under the leadership of Jacques Hébert. In December the Jacobin leader Maximilien Robespierre had Cloots expelled from the Jacobin Club for Cloots’s support of the Hébertist dechristianizers, who were attempting to destroy all Roman Catholic institutions. Accused by Robespierre of being a foreign agent, Cloots was guillotined with the leading Hébertists.
