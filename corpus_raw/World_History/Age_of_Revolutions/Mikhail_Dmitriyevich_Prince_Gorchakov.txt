Prince Mikhail Dmitriyevich Gorchakov,  (born 1793—died May 18 [May 30, New Style], 1861, Warsaw, Poland, Russian Empire [now in Poland]), Russian military officer and statesman who played a major role in the Crimean War (1853–56) and served as the Russian viceroy in Poland (1856–61).
Gorchakov gained his early military experience during the Russian campaign in Persia (1810), the invasion of Russia by Napoleon I (1812–14), and the sieges of Silistra and Shumla in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29. Soon after his appointment as a general officer in 1830, he was assigned to the Russian forces suppressing an insurrection in Poland (1830); though he was wounded during Russia’s defeat at the Battle of Grochów in February 1831, he distinguished himself when the Russian army seized Warsaw (September 1831) and crushed the rebellion.
Gorchakov was appointed military governor of Warsaw (1846), served as chief of staff of the Russian army that helped Austria suppress the Hungarian revolution of 1848, and afterward became chief of staff of the Russian army and adjutant general to Tsar Nicholas I. In 1853, after diplomatic relations between Russia and the Ottoman Empire were broken, he led the Russian occupation force that entered the Turkish-controlled principality of Moldavia (July 1853). When the Crimean War was formally declared several months later, Gorchakov was appointed commander in chief of the Russian troops in Moldavia and Walachia. In April 1854 he laid siege to Silistra, but in June, before he could take that strategic Turkish fortress on the Danube River, Nicholas ordered him to withdraw. In February 1855 he was transferred to the post of commander in chief of the Russian forces in Crimea. Although he did not believe he could salvage the Russian situation, he did try to save Sevastopol, which had been placed under siege in October 1854. He suffered defeat in August 1855 at the Battle of the Chernaya River, however, and was forced to burn Sevastopol and retreat after the enemy launched a new assault in early September.
After the conclusion of the Crimean War (March 1856), Gorchakov succeeded the dictatorial Ivan Paskevich as governor-general of Poland, where he inaugurated a policy of leniency and reform. Nevertheless, he was unable to curb the mounting animosity among the Poles toward Russian rule, seen in demonstrations (February 1861) commemorating the Polish victory at Grochów.
