George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth,  (born 1647/48—died  Oct. 25, 1691, London), British admiral and commander in chief who is best known for his service during the reigns of Charles II and James II.
Legge attended King’s College, Cambridge, and volunteered his service in the navy during the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–67). He was a member of the household of the Duke of York (later James II), was governor of Portsmouth, and master general of the army. In 1682 Legge was created Baron Dartmouth. He was admiral of a fleet that in 1683 sailed to Tangier, dismantled the fortifications, and brought back the English troops. Under James II, who had acceded to the throne in 1685, Dartmouth was master of the horse and governor of the Tower of London.
In 1688, when an invasion by William of Orange (later William III) was expected, James II appointed Dartmouth commander in chief of his fleet. Although he was himself loyal to James, the same was not true of most of his officers, and an engagement with William was purposely avoided. Dartmouth refused to assist the king in getting James Edward, Prince of Wales, out of the country, and he even reproved the king for attempting this proceeding. When James II himself fled to France, Dartmouth left the fleet and took the oath of allegiance to William and Mary. In July 1691, however, he was arrested for treason and was charged with offering to hand over Portsmouth to France and to command a French fleet. Dartmouth protested his innocence, but he died in the Tower of London before the question was resolved.
