Algeciras Conference,   (Jan. 16–April 7, 1906), international conference of the great European powers and the United States, held at Algeciras, Spain, to discuss France’s relationship to the government of Morocco. The conference climaxed the First Moroccan Crisis (see Moroccan crises).
Two years earlier an Entente Cordiale, signed by Great Britain and France, had provided, among other things, for British support of French special interests in Morocco. France’s attempt to implement the agreement by presenting the Moroccan sultan with a program of economic and police “reforms” brought the indignant German emperor William II to Tangier in March 1905. William challenged French intentions by affirming the sovereignty of the Sultan and demanding the retention of the “open door” for commerce.
Tension was relieved as U.S. Pres. Theodore Roosevelt was prevailed upon by the Emperor to help bring about the 1906 conference in Algeciras. Contrary to German expectations, only Austria-Hungary supported Germany’s views; Italy, Russia, and, more significantly, Britain and the United States lined up behind France. On the surface, nevertheless, the convention, the Act of Algeciras, signed on April 7, 1906, appeared to limit French penetration. It reaffirmed the independence of the sultan and the economic equality of the powers, and it provided that French and Spanish police officers be under a Swiss inspector general.
The real significance of the Algeciras Conference is to be found in the substantial diplomatic support given France by Britain and the United States, foreshadowing their roles in World War I, to which the Moroccan Crisis was a prelude.
