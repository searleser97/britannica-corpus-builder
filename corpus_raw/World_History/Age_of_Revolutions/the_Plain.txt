The Plain, French la Plaine, also called le Marais (“the Marsh”),  in the French Revolution, the centrist deputies in the National Convention (1792–95). They formed the majority of the assembly’s members and were essential to the passage of any measures. Their name derived from their place on the floor of the assembly; above them sat the members of the Mountain, or the Montagnards. Led by Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès, the Plain initially voted with the moderate Girondins but later joined the Montagnards in voting for the execution of Louis XVI. In 1794 they helped overthrow Maximilien de Robespierre and other extreme Jacobins (see Jacobin Club).
