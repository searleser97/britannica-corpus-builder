Jean-Baptiste Drouet,  (born 1763, Sainte-Menehould, Fr.—died  April 11, 1824, Mâcon), French revolutionary, chiefly remembered for his part in the arrest of Louis XVI at Varennes.
Drouet grew up and lived in the town of Sainte-Menehould in Champagne, where his father had been postmaster. There, the carriages conveying Louis XVI and his family on their flight to the frontier stopped at his door on the evening of June 21, 1791. The passengers were recognized by Drouet, who took steps which led to their arrest on reaching Varennes. For this service he declined a reward. In September 1792 he was elected deputy of the Convention. He voted the death of the king without appeal, showed implacable hostility to the Girondins and proposed the slaughter of all English residents in France. He was captured by the Austrians at the siege of Maubeuge in Hainault (1793) and imprisoned at Spielberg in Austria until the close of 1795. He then became a member of the Council of Five Hundred and was named secretary. Drouet was implicated in the conspiracy of Babeuf (1796) and was imprisoned, but he escaped to Switzerland and then to Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands. There he took part in the resistance to Horatio Nelson’s attempt on the island in 1797. He later visited India.
The first empire found in him a docile subprefect of Sainte-Menehould. After the second Restoration he had to leave France (1816). Returning secretly, he settled at Mâcon under the name of Merger.
