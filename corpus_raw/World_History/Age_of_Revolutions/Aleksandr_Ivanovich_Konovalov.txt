Aleksandr Ivanovich Konovalov,  (born 1875, Russia—died  1948, New York City), liberal Russian factory owner and political figure; he played a supporting role in the provisional government that was overthrown during the Russian Revolution of November (October, old style) 1917, which was engineered by Lenin and the Bolshevik party.
Born into a prosperous family engaged in textile manufacturing, Konovalov was educated in England and later headed the stock society that controlled his family’s holdings. Active in politics, he was leader of the Progressive Party and served as a deputy to the fourth state Duma, at one point acting as assistant chairman. In August 1915 he helped to organize the Progressive Bloc, a coalition of liberal parties in the Duma that issued a demand for sweeping reforms, which the Tsar and his ministers rejected. After the abdication of the Tsar in March 1917, he joined the Constitutional Democratic Party. He was appointed minister of trade and industry during the first two cabinets of the provisional government and served as Premier A.F. Kerensky’s vice-premier during the last coalition. He was arrested along with other members of the provisional government on Nov. 7 (Oct. 25, O.S.), 1917, in the Winter Palace but was set free soon thereafter. Soviet historians claim that he was one of the organizers of the unsuccessful Kronshtadt Rebellion (1921) by members of the Russian Baltic fleet, but other observers dispute this. After leaving Russia, he participated in several anti-Soviet emigré organizations.
