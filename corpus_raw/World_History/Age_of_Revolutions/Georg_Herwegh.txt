Georg Herwegh,   (born May 31, 1817, Stuttgart, Württemberg [Germany]—died  April 7, 1875, Baden-Baden, Ger.), poet whose appeal for a revolutionary spirit in Germany was strengthened by a lyric sensitivity.
Herwegh was expelled from the theological college at Tübingen and began his literary career as a journalist. Called up for military duty, he tactlessly insulted an officer and was forced to flee to Switzerland. There he found a publisher for his best-known collection, Gedichte eines Lebendigen (1841, 1843; “Poems of One Living”), political poems expressing the aspirations of German youth. Although the book was confiscated, it made his reputation overnight and ran through several editions.
When he returned to Germany in 1842, he was enthusiastically welcomed by popular demonstrations of sympathy; the Prussian king Frederick William IV received him in an amicable spirit and is said to have considered him an honourable enemy. But when a new journal Herwegh was planning was suppressed, he wrote to the king in a tactless tone and was immediately expelled from Prussia, returning to Switzerland as a political martyr. From there Herwegh went to France. When the Revolution of 1848 broke out, he led 800 French and German workers in an uprising in Baden. His disastrous defeat practically put an end to his career. He escaped to Switzerland and lived in Zürich and Paris until an amnesty in 1866 permitted him to return to Germany.
Herwegh also translated the works of Alphonse de Lamartine and several plays by William Shakespeare, including Coriolanus and King Lear. His last volume of poetry, Neue Gedichte (1877; “New Poems”), appeared posthumously.
