Barbara Hauer Frietschie, née Barbara Hauer, Frietschie also spelled Fritchie,  (born Dec. 3, 1766, Lancaster, Pa. [U.S.]—died Dec. 18, 1862, Frederick, Md.), American patriot whose purported act of defiant loyalty to the North during the American Civil War became highly embellished legend and the subject of literary treatment.
Barbara Hauer was the daughter of German immigrants. In 1806 she married John C. Frietschie. Little else is known of her life until early September 1862, when the Army of Northern Virginia paused in Frederick during the Confederate invasion of Maryland. On marching out of town on September 10 the troops passed Frietschie’s house, and she may have waved a small Union flag from the porch or a second-floor window. There may also have been some small incident as a result. Whatever the actual case, the story soon grew up in Frederick that Frietschie, who was known to be intensely patriotic, had somehow defied the Confederate army. The story’s connection with fact was broken by Frietschie’s death in 1862.
The tale was heard by the novelist Emma D.E.N. Southworth, who passed it on to John Greenleaf Whittier. In October 1863 Whittier published in the Atlantic Monthly his verse version, “Barbara Frietchie,” in which the story of Frietschie’s encounter with General Thomas J. (“Stonewall”) Jackson was much elaborated. Whittier’s version quickly became canonical, and the enduring popularity of the poem kept Frietschie’s name alive. Despite its meagre factual basis—the one thing known certainly of the events of that day is that Jackson did not pass Frietschie’s house—the endurance of the tale led to the erection of a memorial in 1913 and the building in 1926 of a replica of her house (the original having been razed a few years after her death).
