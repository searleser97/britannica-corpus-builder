Battle of Smolensk,  (16–18 August 1812), engagement of the Napoleonic Wars.  When Napoleon invaded Russia in June 1812, he led a multinational army of more than half a million soldiers. He needed a rapid and decisive victory, but although victorious at Smolensk, some 230 miles (370 km) west of Moscow and the first major battle of the invasion, he was unable to destroy Russian resistance. This meant the campaign would continue deeper into Russian territory.
Napoleon’s aim was the strategic envelopment of the Russian army in the first few weeks of the campaign. However, the heavily outnumbered Russians pulled back rather than risk all in a single battle. Napoleon hoped they would be forced to stand and fight at Smolensk, one of Russia’s most sacred cities. In this he was correct; Alexander and the Russian people insisted that the city must not be surrendered tamely.
Two French columns crossed the River Dnieper at night, and a forced march took them within 30 miles (48 km) of Smolensk before they met any resistance. However, a stubborn rearguard action allowed the Russians time to man the rather aged and dilapidated city defenses, and in the suburbs a confused battle raged as the French attempted to take the city by storm.
French artillery pounded much of the city to burning ruins, but the Russian infantry defended their positions with a grim tenacity that stunned the French. Having brought the enemy to battle, Napoleon intended to encircle them. However, the Russian commanders feared such a move and ordered a withdrawal during the night. Again the stubbornness of the rearguard proved vital; ten regiments fought determinedly as the first of Napoleon’s troops (largely Portuguese and German conscripts) broke into the city. The Russians retreated over the river and burned the bridges behind them. The possession of burned ruins was all that Napoleon had achieved.
Losses: Russian, 12,000 to 14,000 dead or wounded of 125,000; French, 10,00 dead or wounded of 185,000.
