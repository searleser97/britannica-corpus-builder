Black Watch, also called Royal Highland Regiment,  title of a famous Highland regiment in the British Army.
The origin of the regiment dates from 1725 when Highlanders loyal to the British crown were formed into six independent companies to help restore order after the abortive 1715 uprising of the clans under John Erskine, the 6th earl of Mar. In enforcing the Disarming Act in Scotland they were required to keep a constant watch on rival clans to prevent plunder and reprisals. Their tartan, of sombre appearance, won the force the Scots Gaelic appellation of Freicudan Du (“Black Watch”) in contrast to regular troops who wore scarlet coats, waistcoats, and breeches, and were called Seidaran Dearag (“Red Soldiers”).
In 1739 four additional companies were authorized, and in 1740 the force was made a line regiment of the British Army. The newly organized regiment was known as the 43rd Foot until 1749, when it became the 42nd. It was designated a Royal regiment in 1758, and in 1861 “Black Watch” became an official part of the name. The distinctive red plume, worn in contrast to the white plume of other Highland regiments, was authorized for the Black Watch by King George III in recognition of a daring exploit during the French Revolutionary Wars.
Other campaigns in which the regiment distinguished itself included the French and Indian War, the Crimean War, the Peninsular and Waterloo campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars, and the South African War. In World War I the regiment sustained heavy casualties in fighting on the Western Front, in the Balkans, and in the Middle East. Elements of the Black Watch served in virtually every theatre in which the British Army was engaged in World War II, and it opposed the final Chinese offensive in the Korean War. It was employed extensively in peacekeeping operations in the second half of the 20th century, and it participated in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
