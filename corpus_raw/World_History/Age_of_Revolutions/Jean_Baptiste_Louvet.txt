Jean-Baptiste Louvet, in full Jean-Baptiste Louvet de Couvray,  (born June 12, 1760, Paris, France—died August 25, 1797, Paris), French literary figure prominent as a Girondin during the Revolution.
While working as a bookseller, Louvet won fame as the author of a licentious novel published from 1786 to 1791; the work was reprinted many times as Les Amours (or, in some editions, Les Aventures) du chevalier de Faublas (“The Loves [The Adventures] of the Chevalier de Faublas”). In 1793 Louvet married a former jeweler’s wife, Marguerite Denuelle, whom he had abducted and whom he named Lodoïska; she shared in all the future vicissitudes of his life.
Louvet became involved in the early stages of the French Revolution. He joined the Jacobin Club and, as a member of the Jacobins’ correspondence committee, launched a poster newssheet, La Sentinelle, in March 1792, to combat the court’s policy. The newssheet was soon subsidized by the Ministry of the Interior, then under J.-M. Roland, and its success helped Louvet’s election to the Convention as deputy for Loiret.
He joined the Girondins in the Convention and participated in their attack on Maximilien Robespierre (October 29, 1792). He retorted to Robespierre’s reply with a pamphlet, À Maximilien Robespierre et à ses royalistes, which was full of misrepresentations. At King Louis XVI’s trial, he voted for the death sentence with a suspension.
After the overthrow of the Girondins (June 2, 1793), Louvet fled Paris to escape the guillotine, but the Thermidorian Reaction that ended the Terror allowed him to return in October 1794. Readmitted to the Convention on March 8, 1795, he remained a republican while many other Girondins turned royalist. He protested against the excesses of the reaction after the rising of 1 Prairial, year III (May 20, 1795). Under the Directory, he represented Haute-Vienne in the Council of Five Hundred and resumed a career as a journalist.
