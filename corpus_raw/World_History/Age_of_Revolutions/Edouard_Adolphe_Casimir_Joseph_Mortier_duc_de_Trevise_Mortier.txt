Édouard-Adolphe-Casimir-Joseph Mortier, duke de Trevise,  (born February 13, 1768, Cateau-Cambrésis, France—died July 28, 1835, Paris), French general, one of Napoleon’s marshals, who also served as prime minister and minister of war during the reign of King Louis-Philippe.
Mortier fought in the wars of the French Revolution, serving in the Army of the North, the Army of the Danube, and the Army of Helvetia. He was promoted to general in 1799, and became in May 1800 commander of the 10th military division, in charge of Paris. In April 1803 he occupied Hanover after the collapse of the peace of Amiens and in May 1804 was named one of the 18 marshals of the empire by Napoleon. In November 1805 he was defeated at Dürnstein in Austria by the Russian general Mikhail Kutuzov. He served in the Prussian campaign in 1806 and 1807 and fought in Spain in 1808, taking part in the siege of Saragossa and defeating 60,000 Spanish troops in the Battle of Ocaña. He commanded the Young Guard in the Russian campaign of 1812 and attempted to hold off the onslaught of the Allied armies outside Paris in 1814.
At the First Restoration of the Bourbons (1814), Mortier was recognized as a peer, but during the Hundred Days, in which Napoleon tried to reconquer his empire, Mortier rejoined him. After the second return of the Bourbons, he was in disgrace until 1819, when his peerage was restored. After the Revolution of July 1830, in which Charles X was replaced by Louis-Philippe, Mortier served as ambassador to St. Petersburg and was prime minister and minister of war from November 1834 to March 1835. He was killed in Giuseppe Fieschi’s assassination attempt on the life of King Louis-Philippe.
