Thomas, 1st Marquess Wharton,  (born August 1648, England—died April 12, 1715, London), English peer who was one of the principal Whig politicians after the Glorious Revolution (1688–89).
The son of Philip Wharton, 4th Baron Wharton, he became a member of the House of Commons in 1673 and remained an M.P. until he inherited his father’s title in 1696. He was a strong supporter of the bill (1679–80) to exclude James, the Roman Catholic duke of York, from the succession. Wharton secretly corresponded with William of Orange and was one of the first English peers to join him at Exeter after his landing in England in November 1688. Wharton was also the author of the popular Whig ballad “Lilliburlero” (“Lilli Burlero”), which is said to have “sung James out of three kingdoms.”
In reward for his services during the revolution, William III made Wharton comptroller of the household from 1689 to 1702. During these years he served as the principal liaison between the king and the House of Commons and was the principal manager of Whig voting in the Commons. Upon her accession in 1702, Queen Anne dismissed Wharton from office because she disapproved of his morals. Wharton was nevertheless created an earl in 1706, and after Anne’s death in 1714 he helped contrive the peaceful accession of the elector of Hanover to the English throne as George I. The new king made Wharton a marquess in 1715.
Wharton combined a dashing but rather dissolute private life—he has been called “the greatest rake of the Regency”—with an unswerving adherence to the principles enshrined in the Glorious Revolution.
