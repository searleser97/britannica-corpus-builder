Nancy Hart, née Ann Morgan,  (born c. 1735, Pennsylvania or North Carolina [U.S.]—died 1830, Kentucky), American Revolutionary heroine around whom gathered numerous stories of patriotic adventure and resourcefulness.
Ann Morgan grew up in the colony of North Carolina. She is traditionally said to have been related to both Daniel Boone and General Daniel Morgan, although with no real evidence in either case. She and her husband, Benjamin Hart, moved to Wilkes county, Georgia. She was well able to handle a rifle in the fierce and bloody internecine fighting that beset Georgia during the American Revolution.
Nancy Hart was a stalwart supporter of the Whig cause. A number of stories of her exploits in the war grew up and circulated for years before being written down. The best-known story told of a day when five or six armed Tories arrived at her cabin and demanded that she cook them a meal. As she roasted her last turkey, shot by one of the Tories, her young daughter slipped away to arouse neighbouring Whigs. Hart plied the Tories with whiskey and contrived to get near their stacked rifles. She put two rifles out through a crack between the logs before she was detected, and she quickly took up a third to defend herself. One of the men rushed her and was shot dead; another she wounded. When help arrived, the Tories were taken to the woods and hanged.
Other stories told of Hart’s acting as a spy for Georgia patriot forces, crossing the Savannah River on a raft of logs tied with grapevines to bring back information from enemy camps. After the war the Harts moved to Brunswick, Georgia, where Benjamin Hart died. Nancy Hart later moved to Kentucky. The story of her war exploit was first published in a newspaper reminiscence occasioned by the visit of the marquis de Lafayette to the United States in 1825. In 1848 it was retold by Elizabeth F. Ellet in Women of the American Revolution. In 1853 Hart county, Georgia, and in 1856 its seat, Hartwell, were named in her honour.
