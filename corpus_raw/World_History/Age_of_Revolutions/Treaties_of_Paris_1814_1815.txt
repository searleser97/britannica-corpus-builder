Treaties of Paris,  (1814–15), two treaties signed at Paris respectively in 1814 and 1815 that ended the Napoleonic Wars. The treaty signed on May 30, 1814, was between France on the one side and the Allies (Austria, Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, and Portugal) on the other. (Spain made the same treaty with France in July.) Napoleon had abdicated as France’s emperor in April, and the victorious Allies, even after nearly a quarter century of war, gave generous terms to France under the restored Bourbon dynasty. France was allowed to retain its boundaries of Jan. 1, 1792, keeping possession of the enclaves annexed in the early years of the French Revolution. France was restored the majority of its foreign colonies, but Tobago and Saint Lucia in the West Indies and the Île-de-France (now Mauritius) in the Indian Ocean were ceded to Great Britain. The treaty dealt only in general terms with the disposal of the European territories taken from the French empire and ended with the provision that all of the powers engaged on either side in the war should send plenipotentiaries to the Congress of Vienna to complete those arrangements.
The second treaty between France and the Allies, of Nov. 20, 1815, was signed in an altogether different spirit from the first. Napoleon had escaped from Elba and been welcomed by the French, and, consequently, war between France and the Allies had resumed and continued until Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. The second treaty abandoned the lenient spirit of the first and exacted indemnities from France, partly in the form of territory and partly in money. The French frontier was changed from that of 1792 to that of Jan. 1, 1790, thus stripping France of the Saar and Savoy. France had to pay an indemnity of 700,000,000 francs and to support an army of occupation of 150,000 men on its soil for three to five years.
