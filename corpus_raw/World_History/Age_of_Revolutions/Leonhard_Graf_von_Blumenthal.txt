Leonhard, count von Blumenthal,  (born July 30, 1810, Schwedt an der Oder, Brandenburg—died December 22, 1900, Quellendorf, Anhalt, Germany), Prussian field marshal active in the wars that founded the German Empire.
He entered the guard as second lieutenant in 1827 and took part in 1848 in the suppression of the Berlin riots. In 1849 he served on the staff of General von Bonin in the Schleswig-Holstein campaign and so distinguished himself, particularly at Fredericia, that he was appointed chief of staff of the Schleswig-Holstein army. In 1858 he was appointed personal adjutant to Prince Frederick Charles. He was chief of staff of the 3rd army corps in 1864 when, on the outbreak of the Danish War of 1864, he was made chief of the general staff of the army against Denmark and distinguished himself at Düppel and the passage to Alsen Island.
In the Seven Weeks’ War with Austria in 1866, Blumenthal was chief of staff to the crown prince of Prussia, commanding the 2nd army. From 1866 to 1870 he commanded the 14th division at Düsseldorf. In the Franco-German War of 1870–71, he was chief of staff of the 3rd army, again under Crown Prince Frederick William, whose victories owed much to Blumenthal’s bold decisions. In 1873 he became a general of infantry, and 10 years later he was made a count. In 1888 he was made a field marshal.
