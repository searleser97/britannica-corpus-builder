Westmore Family,  family of Hollywood makeup artists credited with having introduced the art of makeup to the motion-picture industry.
Born in Great Britain, on the Isle of Wight, George Westmore (1879–1931) fought in the South African (Boer) War and, after marriage to a hometown friend, Ada Savage (died 1923), opened his first hairdressing salon. He moved to Canterbury and then to Canada and the United States, working as a hairdresser in various cities before gravitating to Los Angeles in 1917. There he soon got a job at the Selig Studio and established the first studio makeup department in history; a few months later he moved to Triangle Studios, supervising the makeup for such stars as Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Lillian and Dorothy Gish, Billie Burke, Norma Talmadge, and Theda Bara. During the 1920s, however, his own work came to be overshadowed by that of his sons; and a series of disappointments, together with an unhappy second marriage, led to his suicide in 1931.
All his six surviving sons became heads or assistant heads of makeup departments of major studios. Montague George Westmore (1902–40), known as “Mont,” first worked free-lance for such directors as Cecil B. deMille but eventually joined the studios of David O. Selznick, supervising makeup during the screen tests for as well as the filming of Gone with the Wind (1939). Percival Harry Westmore (1904–70), known as “Perc” (pronounced “Purse”), headed the makeup department of First National Pictures and then of the company that absorbed it, Warner Brothers, where he remained for 27 years, joining Universal Studios only late in life. Perc was also the chief administrator of the elegant salon on Sunset Boulevard, The House of Westmore (1935–65), though all the family were financially involved.
Perc’s twin brother, Ernest Henry Westmore (1904–68), known as “Ern,” worked first at First National and then became head of makeup at RKO; while there (1929–31) he won the first award ever given to a makeup artist by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, for his work on the film Cimarron. (The next award for makeup was not given until 1982.) Ern later supervised makeup at 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation. Walter James Westmore (1906–73), known as “Wally,” headed the makeup department at Paramount Studios for 41 years (1926–67). Hamilton Adolph Westmore (1918–73), known as “Bud,” worked at Paramount and 20th Century-Fox and then was makeup chief at Universal Studios for almost 24 years (1946–70). Frank Westmore (1923–85) was long associated with Paramount Pictures.
Some third-generation Westmores also became prominent in the art of makeup—not only in theatrical makeup but also in therapeutic makeup for victims of facial burns, diseases, or accidents.
