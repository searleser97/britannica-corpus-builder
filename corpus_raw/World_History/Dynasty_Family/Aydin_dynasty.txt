Aydın Dynasty,   Turkmen dynasty (c. 1308–1425) that ruled in the Aydın-Izmir region in western Anatolia. Situated in a prosperous coastal region, the Aydın principality was active in the Mediterranean trade. As a frontier state between the declining Byzantine Empire and the growing Ottoman state, it had a monopoly in providing mercenary troops to rival Byzantine factions, and it also offered leadership to the ghazis (Muslim warriors) in their excursions into Byzantine lands.
Mehmed Bey (reigned c. 1308–34) founded the dynasty in territories he conquered in the Aegean region, including Birgi, Ayasoluk (modern Selçuk, Turkey), Tyre, and İzmir. His son and successor, Umur Bey (Umur I; reigned 1334–48), organized a fleet and led expeditions to the Aegean islands, the Balkans, and the Black Sea coasts, intervening in dynastic quarrels and assisting John VI Cantacuzenus in the neighbouring Byzantine Empire.
A crusade was organized against him under Pope Clement VI; it included Venice, Genoa, and the king of Cyprus. Umur Bey lost his fleet and the fortress of İzmir to the crusaders in 1344, and he was killed in battle against them in 1348. His death marked the decline of the principality.
Under Umur’s successors, a treaty signed Aug. 18, 1348, gave the Latin crusader states commercial advantages over Aydın; the principality lost its political significance as a frontier state to the Ottomans and was annexed by the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I in 1390. Its independence was restored by the Central Asian conqueror Timur (Tamerlane) in 1402. Cunayd, the last prince of Aydın (reigned 1405–25), after continual interference in Ottoman dynastic struggles, was captured and executed by Sultan Murad II, who then permanently annexed the principality.
