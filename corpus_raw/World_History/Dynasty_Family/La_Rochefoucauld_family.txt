La Rochefoucauld Family,   one of France’s noblest families, traceable in Angoumois to the year 1019. Ducal titles belonging to it are: duke (duc) de La Rochefoucauld (1622); duke de La Roche-Guyon (1679); duke d’Anville (1732); duke d’Estissac; duke de Liancourt (1747); duke de Doudeauville (1780); duke (duca) di Bisaccia (Neapolitan title; 1851); and duke (duque) de Estrées (Spanish title; 1892). Its two best-known members are François VI, duke de La Rochefoucauld and François-Alexandre-Frédéric, duke de La Rochefoucauld-Liancourt. The family’s claim to princely privileges in France was urged without success in the mid-17th century, but the bearers of the Bisaccia title were granted princely rank in Bavaria in 1855.
