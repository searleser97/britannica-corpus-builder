Trapp Family,   Austrian singers whose story was made into a popular Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway musical, The Sound of Music (1959), that proved one of the most successful in theatre history. Their story was also the basis for a film starring Julie Andrews (1965) that had a comparable success.
Maria Augusta Kutschera (b. Jan. 26, 1905, Vienna—d. March 28, 1987, Morrisville, Vt., U.S.), the best-known member of the family, wrote The Story of the Trapp Family Singers (1949). She recounted her experience as an orphan and novitiate in a Benedictine convent in Salzburg. As a governess, she won the hearts of the seven children of a widower, Freiherr (Baron) Georg von Trapp, a World War I submarine commander, and of the baron himself. She was married to Trapp in 1927, and they had three children. In the mid-1930s the family began singing German and liturgical music under the tutelage of the Reverend Franz Wasner, who continued as their director. In 1937 they made their first European tour as professional singers—the Trapp Family Choir. With Father Wasner, the family fled in 1938 from Nazi-dominated Austria to Italy (Switzerland in the play) and emigrated to the United States. As the Trapp Family Singers they developed a program of folk and other music that appealed to audiences worldwide. They toured in many countries from 1940 until 1955, when the group disbanded. Georg von Trapp died in 1947.
Maria Augusta, who with other family members became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1948, helped manage a family lodge in Stowe, Vt., from the 1940s on. She also conducted a summer music camp there until 1956. The Trapp Family Austrian Relief, Inc., was established in 1947.
