Romero family,  family of Spanish guitarists prominent in the 20th-century revival of the classical guitar. They appeared individually as soloists, together in a quartet, and in other combinations.
Celedonio (b. March 2, 1913, Cienfuegos, Cuba—May 8, 1996, San Diego, California, U.S.)studied at the Conservatory of Málaga and, later, at the Conservatory of Madrid, where he was a pupil of Joaquín Turina. He first performed in public at age 10, and, following a formal debut at age 22, he played concerts throughout Spain, France, and Italy. By the late 1950s he had settled with his family in the United States. From the early 1960s he and his three sons—Celin, Pepe, and Angel—toured worldwide and were known as the “royal family of the guitar.” Celedonio Romero wrote music for solo guitar (suites, studies, character pieces) as well as the Concierto de Málaga for guitar and orchestra. In 1967 Joaquín Rodrigo composed a concerto for four guitars, Concierto Andaluz, for the Romeros. Celino Romero (son of Celin) joined the ensemble in 1990 after Angel departed the group, and Lito Romero (son of Angel) joined the quartet in 1996 after Celedonio Romero’s death.
