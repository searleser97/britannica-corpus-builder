Hallam family,  family of Anglo-American actors and theatrical managers associated with the beginning of professional theatre in what is now the United States.
Lewis Hallam (1714–56) was the founder of the family. With his wife, three children, and a company of 10, Hallam left his native England and arrived in the British North American colonies in 1752. Their first production of William Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice, presented September 15 in Williamsburg, Va., was the first appearance of a professional acting company in the colonies. In 1753 they built the first theatre in New York City, where they met opposition by many of the local residents who thought actors and plays were “instruments of the devil.” The company later toured the colonies and also performed in Jamaica, where Hallam died.
His widow, Sarah, married David Douglass, manager of another company in the West Indies, and in 1758 that company returned to New York City with Douglass as manager. By 1763 they were known as the American Company. Under Douglass’ management they opened several theatres and on April 24, 1767, in Philadelphia, presented the first professional production of an American play, The Prince of Parthia by Thomas Godfrey. Hallam’s daughter Isabella (1746–1826), who acted under the name of Mrs. Mattocks, was a well-known actress in England. Hallam’s son, Lewis Hallam the Younger (c. 1740–1808), was the company’s leading man for a number of years. After his mother died (1774) and his stepfather retired to Jamaica, the younger Hallam succeeded to management of the family company. For the next 25 years he managed and acted with various companies throughout the United States. Though an accomplished actor, he was known as a quarrelsome and financially inept manager.
