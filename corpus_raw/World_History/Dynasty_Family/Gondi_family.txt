Gondi Family,  French family of Florentine origin, whose diplomats and bankers were prominent in France from the 16th century. The family established itself in France after gaining the confidence and patronage of Catherine de Médicis. Antoine II (1486–1560) was the first Gondi to settle in France and started the most illustrious branch of the family. At first a banker in Lyon, he was brought to Paris by Catherine de Médicis, who made him steward to the Duke d’Anjou, later Henry III. Jean-Baptiste (1501–1580), nephew of Antoine, was steward to Catherine herself. A great-nephew, Jérôme II (1550–1600), Baron de Codun, helped arrange the marriage of Charles IX and Elizabeth of Austria (1570). Under Henry III, he served as ambassador to Venice and Rome, and Henry IV reappointed him as ambassador to Rome.
Antoine II’s oldest son, Albert (b. Nov. 4, 1522, Florence—d. April 21, 1602), went to the court of Henry II in 1547. Serving valiantly in several military campaigns, he took the part of the monarch during the Wars of Religion. Albert himself served as proxy in the marriage of Charles IX to Elizabeth of Austria, which his nephew Jerome II had helped to arrange. On his return, the king rewarded him with the governorship of Metz. Albert was made ambassador to London, then marshal of France and governor of Provence (1573). In 1581 he was made Duke de Retz and Marquis de Belle-Isle. His brother Pierre, bishop of Paris, made cardinal in 1587, was sent by Henry IV as ambassador to Rome in 1595. He became a principal adviser to Louis XIII.
Albert’s oldest son was killed in a duel. His second son, Henry I (1572–1622), succeeded his uncle Pierre as bishop of Paris. His third son, Philippe-Emmanuel (b. 1581, Limoges—d. June 29, 1662, Joigny), Marquis de Belle-Isle, Count de Joigny, and Baron de Montmirail, was an outstanding military commander. After his great success in the naval battle of La Rochelle (Oct. 26, 1622), he entered a religious order (Oratorians) in 1625, perhaps influenced by Saint Vincent de Paul. He probably would have obtained a cardinal’s rank but for the animosity of Richelieu, who exiled him to Lyons in 1641. It is claimed that the queen, Anne of Austria, offered Richelieu’s post to Philippe-Emmanuel before offering it to Mazarin. The youngest of Albert’s four sons, Jean-François (1584–1654), succeeded his brother Henry I as bishop of Paris, later becoming archbishop.
Philippe-Emmanuel’s son Jean-François-Paul (b. Sept. 20, 1613, Montmirail–d. Aug. 24, 1679, Paris), tutored by Saint Vincent de Paul, was the famous cardinal of Retz and author of the Mémoires (see Retz, Jean-François-Paul de Gondi, Cardinal de).
