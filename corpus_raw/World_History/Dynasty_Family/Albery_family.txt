Albery family,  British family of theatre managers and playwrights whose members helped build the London theatre into a prime tourist attraction.
James Albery (b. 1838—d. 1889) was a dramatist whose work included Dr. Davy, produced at the Lyceum (1866), and Two Roses, produced at the Vaudeville (1870). Albery’s wife was actress Mary Moore (b. 1861—d. 1931), who after his death became Lady Wyndham when she married Sir Charles Wyndham (1916), founder of Wyndham’s Theatre (1899) and the New Theatre (1903; renamed Albery, 1973). The Wyndhams managed both theatres in addition to the Criterion Theatre.
After the death of Charles (1919) and Lady Wyndham, Bronson Albery (in full Sir Bronson James Albery, b. March 6, 1881, Greenhithe, Kent, Eng.—d. July 21, 1971, London), the second son of Mary Moore and James Albery, assumed joint control of the family theatres with Charles Wyndham’s son, Howard. Previously, Bronson earned renown for his productions of The Knight of the Burning Pestle (1920), David Garrick (1922), and Saint Joan (1924), which broke all existing attendance records at the Queen’s Theatre. He established the Arts Theatre Club (1927) and served on a variety of theatre committees, most notably as president of the Society of West End Theatre Managers (1941–45, 1952–53). He was knighted in 1949.
In 1962 Bronson passed on his theatre holdings to his son, Donald (in full Sir Donald Arthur Rolleston Albery, b. June 19, 1914, London, Eng.—d. Sept. 14, 1988, Monte Carlo, Monaco), whose producing debut was with Graham Greene’s The Living Room (1953). It was followed by two decades of hits, including Waiting for Godot (1955); The Rose Tattoo, A Taste of Honey, The Hostage, and The World of Suzie Wong! (all in 1959); Fings Ain’t Wot They Used T’ Be, A Passage to India, and Oliver! (all in 1960); Beyond the Fringe and Celebration (both in 1961); and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1964). He also mounted many productions in New York City and served as director of the British company Anglia Television (1958–78). He was knighted in 1977.
