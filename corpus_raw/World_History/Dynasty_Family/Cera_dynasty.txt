Cera dynasty, Cera also spelled Chera, also called Keralaputra,  rulers of an ancient kingdom in what is now Kerala state, southwestern India. Cera was one of the three major kingdoms of southern India that constituted Tamilkam (territory of the Tamils) and was centred on the Malabar Coast and its hinterland. The other two dynasties were the Pandyas, based at present-day Madurai, south-central Tamil Nadu state, and the Cholas, centred around modern Thanjavur and the Kaveri (Cauvery) River valley in eastern Tamil Nadu.
In the early centuries bce, the Cera region became known to the Greeks and Romans (who were called Yavana in early Indian literature) for its spices. Cera inscriptions of the 2nd century ce that make reference to the Irrumporai clan have been found near present-day Tiruchirappalli (on the Kaveri west of Thanjavur). Shangam (early Tamil) literature mentions the names of Cera chiefs dated to the 1st century ce. Among them, Nedunjeral Adan is said to have attacked Yavana ships and held Yavana traders ransom. His son Senguttuvan, much eulogized in Shangam poems, is also mentioned in the context of Gajabahuâ€™s rule (2nd century ce) in Sri Lanka.
