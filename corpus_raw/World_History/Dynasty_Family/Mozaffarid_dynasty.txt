Moẓaffarid Dynasty,   (c. 1314–93), Iranian dynasty that ruled over southern Iran. The founder of the dynasty was Sharaf od-Dīn Moẓaffar, a vassal of the Il-Khanid rulers of Iran, who was governor of Meybod, a city lying between Eṣfahān and Yazd. In 1314 his son Mobārez od-Dīn Moḥammad was made governor of Fārs and Yazd by Abū Saʿīd, the Il-Khanid ruler. After Abū Saʿīd’s death, Moḥammad expanded his possessions. In 1340 he married the only daughter of Shāh Jahān, the last ruler of the Qutlugh dynasty in Kermān, thus gaining possession of that region. By 1356, after a series of campaigns, Moḥammad had become the undisputed ruler of southern Iran. In 1356 he attacked and captured Tabrīz, but he was unable to hold it. In 1358 he was deposed by his two sons, Qoṭb od-Dīn Shāh Maḥmūd (reigned 1358–75) and Jalāl od-Dīn Shāh Shojāʿ (reigned 1358–84), who divided the Moẓaffarid territories between them.
Shortly before his death in 1384, Shāh Shojāʿ divided his possessions among his three sons. The Moẓaffarid power was thus fragmented, and Shāh Shojāʿ’s sons were forced to become vassals of Timur, who in 1393 extinguished the dynasty by defeating and killing its last ruler, Manṣūr (reigned 1384–93).
