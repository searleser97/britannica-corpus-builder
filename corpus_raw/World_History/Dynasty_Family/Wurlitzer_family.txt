Wurlitzer Family,   American family of musical-instrument makers and dealers.
Rudolph Wurlitzer (b. Jan. 30, 1831, Schöneck, Saxony [Germany]—d. Jan. 14, 1914, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.), emigrated to the United States in 1853, settling in Cincinnati. He began dealing in musical instruments, which had been the traditional family business since the time of lute-maker Heinrich Wurlitzer (1595–1656). By 1861 he was no longer able to fill all his orders with instruments imported from Germany, and he established a factory in Cincinnati that primarily produced band instruments for military use.
In 1865 a branch was established in Chicago, and in March 1890 the firm was incorporated as the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company, with its founder serving as president (1890–1912) and chairman of the board (1912–14). Three sons followed.
His eldest son and successor, Howard Eugene (b. Sept. 5, 1871, Cincinnati—d. Oct. 30, 1928, New York City), joined the firm in 1889 and also became president (1912–27) and chairman (1927–28). Chiefly through Howard’s efforts, the company expanded in the field of automatic and coin-operated instruments. Rudolph Henry Wurlitzer (b. Dec. 30, 1873, Cincinnati—d. May 27, 1948, Cincinnati), Rudolph’s second son, studied violin in Berlin and became interested in violin construction. His training led to the establishment of the Wurlitzer Collection of Rare Violins. Rudolph Henry was active in the company from 1894 and served as president (1927–32) and chairman (1932–42). The third son, Farny Reginald Wurlitzer (b. Dec. 7, 1883, Cincinnati—d. May 6, 1972, North Tonawanda, N.Y.), was educated in the art and technique of producing modern musical instruments. He returned to Cincinnati in 1904 and in 1909 moved to North Tonawanda, N.Y., to head the manufacturing division that was formed after the purchase of DeKleist, manufacturers of barrel organs. He was president (1932–41), chairman (1942–66), and chairman emeritus (1966–72) of the company.
In 1910 the Wurlitzer Company acquired the Hope-Jones Organ Company of Elmira, N.Y., moving its operations to North Tonawanda. It was there that the pipe organ known as the “Unit Orchestra” and later famous as the “Mighty Wurlitzer” was developed.
With the advent of motion pictures the “Mighty Wurlitzer” theatre organ grew in popularity; it soon appeared as part of the elaborate furnishings in the new movie palaces. Equipped with the sound effects of brass trumpets, tubas, clarinets, oboes, chimes, xylophones, drums, and many other tone colours, the instrument proved to be an attraction in itself, and more “Mighty Wurlitzers” were produced than any other model of pipe organ in history.
