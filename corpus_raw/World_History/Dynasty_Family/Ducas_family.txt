Ducas family, Ducas also spelled Dukas or Doukas,  Byzantine family that supplied several rulers to the empire. First prominent in the 10th century, the family suffered a setback when Constantine Ducas, son of General Andronicus Ducas, lost his life attempting to become emperor in 913. Another Ducas family, perhaps connected with the earlier one through the female line, appeared toward the end of the 10th century. A member of this family became Emperor Constantine X in 1059, and his son, Michael VII, ruled from 1071 to 1078. With Alexius I Comnenus, Michael’s son Constantine was nominally coemperor from 1081 to about 1090. Betrothed to Alexius’s daughter, Anna, Constantine did not live to marry her. In 1204 Alexius V Ducas Mourtzouphlus deposed the emperor Isaac II Angelus and his son Alexius IV, after which he tried in vain to defend Constantinople against Crusaders from the West. A Michael Ducas played a leading role in the mid-14th-century civil war between Emperors John V Palaeologus and John VI Cantacuzenus. His grandson was the 15th-century historian Ducas, known for his vernacular history of the period 1341–1462. So much prestige was attached to the Ducas name that many later rulers tried to add it to their own.
