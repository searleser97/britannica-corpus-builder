Welser Family,   family of German merchants, most prominent from the 15th to the 17th century. It first became important in the 15th century, when the brothers Bartholomew and Lucas Welser carried on an extensive trade with the Levant and elsewhere, and had branches in southern Germany and Italy, and also in Antwerp, London, and Lisbon. The business was continued by Antony (died 1518), a son of Lucas Welser, who was one of the first among the Germans to use the sea route to the East that had been discovered by Vasco da Gama. Having amassed great wealth, Antony’s son Bartholomew (1488–1561) lent large sums of money to Charles V and in return received several marks of the imperial favour. Bartholomew and his brother Antony, however, are chiefly known as the promoters of an expedition under Ambrose Dalfinger (d. 1532), which in 1528 seized the province of Caracas in Venezuela, holding it until 1555. After Bartholomew’s death the business was carried on by three of his sons and two of his nephews; but the firm became bankrupt in 1614. Antony’s grandson, Marcus (1558–1614), was distinguished for his scholarship and his writings, the most important of his many works being Rerum Boicarum libri quinque, dealing with the early history of the Bavarians.
