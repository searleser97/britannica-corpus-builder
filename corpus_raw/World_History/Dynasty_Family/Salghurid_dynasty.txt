Salghurid dynasty,  (1148–1282), Iranian dynasty that ruled in Fārs in southwestern Iran as vassals of the Seljuq, Khwārezm-Shah, and Il-Khanid dynasties.
The Salghurids were one of the several dynasties of atabegs (notables who acted as guardians and tutors of infant Seljuq princes) who were deputized to govern Iranian provinces on behalf of Seljuq kings. The Salghurids in origin belonged to the Salor (Salghur) Turkmen tribe and moved into Fārs early in the 12th century. The founder of the dynasty was Muẓaffar al-Dīn Sonqur (reigned 1148–61), who took advantage of a disturbed state in Fārs to expel his reputed uncle Boz-Aba, the local atabeg. Muẓaffar al-Dīn’s son Zangī (reigned 1161–c. 1175) was confirmed in his possession of Fārs by the Seljuq ruler Arslan ibn Toghrïl.
With the decline of Seljuq power, the Salghurids enjoyed virtual autonomy. During the reign of the fifth Salghurid ruler, ʿIzz al-Dīn Saʿd (reigned 1203–31), however, the Salghurids were forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Khwārezm-Shah dynasty. With the eclipse of the Khwārezm-Shahs, the Salghurids transferred their allegiance to the Il-Khanid rulers of Iran. After a year of independent rule (1263–64), Ābish Khātūn married Mengü Temür, the son of the Il-Khanid ruler of Iran, who assumed de facto power. Following the death of Mengü Temür in 1282, the Il-Khanids assumed direct control of Fārs. Ābish Khātūn died in captivity in Tabrīz several years later, in 1286.
