Maukhari dynasty,  Northern Indian rulers of the 6th century ce. Though originally feudatories of the Guptas, the Maukhari established their independence at Kannauj in the 6th century. The Maukharis ruled over most of what is now Uttar Pradesh, and had some control over Magadha (now in southern Bihar), until those areas were reconquered by the Guptas about 606.
The dynastyâ€™s founder, Ishanavarman, ruled under the title maharajadhiraja. He was succeeded by Sarvavarman, Avantivarman, and Grahavarman.
