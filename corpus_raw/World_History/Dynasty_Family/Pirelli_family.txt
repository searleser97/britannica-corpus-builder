Pirelli Family,   an Italian family of industrialists who contributed to the development of production and commerce in rubber goods, electric wire, and electric cable.
Giovanni Battista Pirelli (b. Dec. 27, 1848, Varenna, Como, Austrian Empire [Italy]—d. Oct. 20, 1932, Milan, Italy) was educated in Milan, and it was there in 1872 that he started a small rubber factory, the first in Italy and one of the first in all of Europe. It pioneered the manufacture of electric cable (1884) and in 1899 began producing automobile tires. In 1902 the company began its foreign expansion by starting a subsidiary factory in Spain.
His two sons, Piero (b. Jan. 27, 1881, Milan—d. Aug. 7, 1956, Milan) and Alberto (b. April 28, 1882, Milan—d. Oct. 19, 1971, Casciano, Italy), joined the business in 1904. Factories were started—under the Société Internationale Pirelli of Basel, Switz.—in Great Britain, other European countries, Turkey, and the Americas; and eventually the Pirelli groups together employed more than 55,000 people. Piero Pirelli, chairman from 1932, greatly assisted the development of the Italian telephone service. His brother, Alberto, who was chairman from 1956 until his retirement in 1965, also was active in international affairs. He was a member of the Supreme Economic Committee of Versailles (1919), Italian delegate to the first International Labour Office of Geneva (1920–22), a member of the League of Nations economic committee (1923–27), and a leading negotiator on war reparations and debts for the Dawes and Young committees (1924, 1929). He became a minister plenipotentiary in 1924 and a minister of state in 1938.
