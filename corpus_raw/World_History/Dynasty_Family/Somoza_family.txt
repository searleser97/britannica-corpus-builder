Somoza family,  family that maintained political control of Nicaragua for 44 years.
The founder of the dynasty, Anastasio Somoza García (b. Feb. 1, 1896, San Marcos, Nicaragua—d. Sept. 29, 1956, Ancón, Panama Canal Zone [now Panama]), was the son of a wealthy coffee planter and was educated in Nicaragua and the United States. By marrying the daughter of a prominent Nicaraguan family, he ensured himself a secure political career. He rose quickly through the political ranks to become head of Nicaragua’s army, the National Guard, in 1933. With the army at his disposal, he three years later deposed the elected president, Juan Bautista Sacasa; Somoza assumed the office on Jan. 1, 1937. Although he was officially not president from 1947 to 1950, his position as commander in chief guaranteed his continuous, firm rule; his authority was again made official by his election to a presidential term beginning in 1951.
Somoza’s administration fostered reforms and made Nicaragua less dependent on banana income. At the same time, however, Somoza amassed a considerable personal fortune, exiled most of his political opponents, and took over the ownership of large areas of land and many businesses.
Following the assassination of Somoza, the presidency passed to his elder son, Luis Somoza Debayle (b. Nov. 18, 1922, León, Nicaragua—d. April 13, 1967, Managua). He won election to his own term of office (1957–63), during which he extended the family’s business interests and, by most accounts, ruled more gently than had his father. After he refused to run for a second term, the presidency was held until 1967 by politicians favourable to the Somoza family.
His younger brother, Anastasio Somoza Debayle (b. Dec. 5, 1925, León, Nicaragua—d. Sept. 17, 1980, Asunción, Paraguay), then won the presidency in a general election. He ruled aggressively in the manner of his father, and he continued to expand the family’s fortune. He relinquished his office in 1972 but in 1974 returned to the presidency under a new constitution that permitted him to rule until 1981. Violent insurrection against the alleged oppression of Somoza’s rule, as well as foreign accusations of violations of human rights, led to his resignation in July 1979, and he was assassinated while in exile.
