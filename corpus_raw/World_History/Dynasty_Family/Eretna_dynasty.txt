Eretna dynasty,  dynasty that succeeded the Mongol Il-Khanid rulers in central Anatolia and ruled there from c. 1343 to 1380.
The dynasty’s founder, Eretna, was an officer of Uyghur origin in the service of Demirtaş, the Il-Khanid governor of Anatolia, who revolted (1326) against the Il-Khanid ruler Abū Saʿīd and escaped to Egypt. Eretna then became governor of Anatolia under the suzerainty of Ḥasan the Elder, ruler of Azerbaijan. After Ḥasan the Elder was defeated by Ḥasan the Younger, son of Demirtaş, Eretna in 1337 received the protection of the Mamluk sultan of Egypt. In 1343, however, Eretna defeated Ḥasan the Younger and emerged as an independent ruler over territories that included Niğde, Ankara, Amasya, Tokat, Samsun, and Erzincan; he made Sivas and later Kayseri his capital. Eretna was a scholarly man and a just ruler; his people called him Köse Peygamber (Prophet with the Scanty Beard).
Under Eretna’s successors, local rulers rebelled; the principality lost territories in the west to the Ottomans and the Karamans and in the east to the Turkmen Ak Koyunlu state. In 1380 Mehmed II, the last Eretna ruler, was killed, and Burhaneddin, a former vizier, proclaimed himself sultan over Eretna lands.
