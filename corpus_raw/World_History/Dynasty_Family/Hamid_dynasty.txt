Hamid Dynasty,  Turkmen dynasty (c. 1300–1423) that ruled in southwestern Anatolia. It was founded by Felekuddin Dündar, whose father, Ilyas, was a frontier ruler under the Seljuqs and who named it after his grandfather; Dündar governed the Hamid principality jointly with his brother Yunus, with two capitals, one at Eğridir and one at Antalya (Attalia). Dündar was defeated and killed (1324) by Demirtaş, the Il-Khanid governor of Anatolia. Eğridir was restored by Dündar’s sons in 1374 as a dependency of the Ottoman Turks.
The Antalya branch was occupied by a Christian force from Cyprus (1361–73). Annexed by the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I in 1392, the principality was restored by Timur (Tamerlane) after his victory over the Ottomans at the Battle of Ankara (1402). In 1423 Osman, the last Hamid ruler, was defeated, and the principality was reincorporated into the Ottoman Empire.
Situated on the north-south route from the Mediterranean port of Antalya to the Mongol empire, Hamid was a strategically and commercially important territory.
