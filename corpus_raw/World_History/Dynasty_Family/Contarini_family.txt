Contarini family,  distinguished Venetian family, one of the 12 that elected the first doge in 697 and later gave Venice eight doges and many other eminent citizens.
The first of the family to be invested doge was Domenico, during whose reign (1043–70) Dalmatia was subjugated and the rebuilding of St. Mark’s Church was begun. Andrea, doge from 1368 to 1382, ended the war with Genoa by defeating its fleet at Chioggia; he was the first to melt down his plate and mortgage his property for the benefit of the state. Gasparo Contarini (1483–1542) was a cardinal and diplomatist; as papal legate to the diet of Regensburg (1541) he favoured certain concessions to the Protestants.
There were at one time no fewer than 18 branches of the family; one of the most important was that of Contarini dallo Zaffo, or di Giaffa, who had been invested with the countship of Jaffa in Syria for their services to Caterina Cornaro, queen of Cyprus; another was that of Contarini degli Scrigni (“of the Coffers”), so called because of their great wealth. Many members of the family distinguished themselves in the service of the republic, in the wars against the Turks, and no fewer than seven Contarini fought at the Battle of Lepanto. Other members of the house were famous as merchants, prelates, and men of letters; among these may be mentioned Marco Contarini (1631–89), who was celebrated as a patron of music and collected at his villa of Piazzola a large number of valuable musical manuscripts, now in the Marciana Library at Venice. The family owned many places in various parts of Venice, and several streets still bear its name.
