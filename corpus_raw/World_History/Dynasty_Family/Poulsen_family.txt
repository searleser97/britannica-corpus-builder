Poulsen family,  famous Danish theatrical family.
Emil Poulsen (b. July 9, 1842, Copenhagen, Den.—d. June 3, 1911, Helsinger) and Olaf Poulsen (b. April 26, 1849, Copenhagen, Den.—d. March 26, 1923, Fredensborg) made their acting debuts on the same night in 1867 at the Danish Royal Theatre. Olaf, one of Denmark’s most popular comic actors, was critically acclaimed for his appearances in works by Ludvig Holberg and for a myriad of Shakespearean roles, including Falstaff, Bottom in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and Sir Toby in Twelfth Night. Emil excelled in such serious roles as Macbeth and Shylock and gained equal prominence as a director. Emil’s sons Adam and Johannes Poulsen were successful actors, and another son, Olaf, was a professional ballet dancer, as was Johannes’s wife, Ulla.
