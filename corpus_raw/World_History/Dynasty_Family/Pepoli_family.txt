Pepoli Family,   family that played an important role in the political and economic life of 13th- and 14th-century Bologna.
The Pepoli, wealthy bankers, were leaders of the Guelf (papal) party and helped expel the Ghibelline (imperial) Lambertazzi from the city in 1274. Romeo de’ Pepoli ruled the city for several years, but an insurrection forced him to flee with his family, and he died in exile in 1321. His son Taddeo, who had received a doctorate in law from the University of Bologna, followed his father into banishment, but after six years he returned to Bologna and in 1337 was acclaimed lord of the city, assuming the title of “keeper of peace and justice.” Pope Benedict XII later recognized him as papal vicar.
After Taddeo’s death, his sons were forced to yield Bologna to the growing power of the Visconti of Milan, and the city fell under the rule of Archbishop Giovanni Visconti in 1352. Unable to recover their political position, the Pepoli became soldiers, scholars, literary men, and jurists. In the 19th century the family was active in the Risorgimento, the movement for Italy’s unification.
