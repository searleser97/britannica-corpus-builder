house of Windsor, formerly (1901–17) Saxe-Coburg-Gotha or Saxe-Coburg and Gotha,  the royal house of the United Kingdom, which succeeded the house of Hanover on the death of its last monarch, Queen Victoria, on January 22, 1901. The dynasty includes Edward VII (reigned 1901–10), George V (1910–36), Edward VIII (1936), George VI (1936–52), and Elizabeth II (1952– ). The heir apparent is Charles, prince of Wales. His elder son, Prince William, duke of Cambridge, is second in line to the British throne.
The dynastic name Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (German: Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha, or Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha) was that of Victoria’s German-born husband, Albert, prince consort of Great Britain and Ireland. Their eldest son was Edward VII. During the anti-German atmosphere of World War I, George V declared by royal proclamation (July 17, 1917) that all descendants of Queen Victoria in the male line who were also British subjects would adopt the surname Windsor.
Queen Elizabeth II’s children would normally have borne their father’s surname, Mountbatten (which itself had been Anglicized from Battenberg). However, in 1952, soon after her accession, she declared in council that her children and descendants would bear the surname Windsor. That decision was modified (February 8, 1960) to the effect that issue other than those styled prince or princess and royal highness should bear the name Mountbatten-Windsor.
