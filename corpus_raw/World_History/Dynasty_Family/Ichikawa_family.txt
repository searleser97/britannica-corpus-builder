Ichikawa Family,   kabuki actors flourishing in Edo (modern Tokyo) from the 17th century to the present. The most famous names are Danjūrō, Ebizō, Danzō, and Ebijūrō, and, according to kabuki convention, these names were assumed by a natural or adopted son of the Ichikawa family when his skill entitled him to inherit the mantle of a famous ancestor. Thus, there have been 12 Danjūrōs (the highest honorific name) and 10 Ebizōs (the second highest). Among the best-known Ichikawas was Danjūrō I (1660–1704), the most famous actor of the Genroku period (1688–1703). He was also a playwright who originated the aragoto (“rough business”) style of heroic drama, the specialty of the Ichikawa family. The heroic dramas feature bold, handsome, idealized warriors with exaggerated and magical powers and childlike, uncomplicated natures. The warrior’s face is marked with red, blue, and black lines, and he carries a huge sword.
Danjūrō VII (1791–1859), the greatest actor of the late Tokugawa period (1603–1867), established the Kabuki jūhachiban (“18 Grand Plays of Kabuki”), the special repertoire of the Ichikawa family. Danjūrō IX (1838–1903), of the Meiji period (1868–1912), revitalized the theatre and participated in the first kabuki performance in the presence of the emperor.
Danjūrō XI (1909–65) was among the top kabuki actors in the post-World War II period. He performed in both traditional and contemporary plays. His performances as Prince Genji in an adaptation of Genji monogatari (The Tale of Genji) constituted a high point in postwar kabuki theatre. His son, who became Ebizō X, was one of Tokyo’s “Great Five,” the young kabuki actors on whom the future of kabuki depended following the deaths of many of the great actors of the previous generation. In 1985 Ebizō X took the name Danjūrō XII.
