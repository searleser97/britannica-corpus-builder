Bonacolsi Family,   Italian family in despotic control of the cities of Mantua (1276–1328), Modena (1312–26), and Carpi (1317–26). The first member recorded in Mantua was Otolino de Bonacosa in 1168. His son Gandolfo became console in 1200, and his grandson Martino was rector (1233).
The signoria (lordship) of the Bonacolsi was first established by Pinamonte (died 1293), who allied himself with other powerful families to eliminate his rivals and finally seized power by driving out the podesta (feudal mayor) and his supporters (1276). After transferring control of Mantua from the pro-papist Guelf party to the pro-imperial Ghibelline party, Pinamonte conquered several Guelf cities (1275–79).
In 1291 Pinamonte was forced to yield power to his son Bardellone, who later poisoned him. Proclaiming himself captain general and perpetual rector, Bardellone pursued an anti-Ghibelline policy until he, in turn, was overthrown in 1299 by his nephews Guido (died 1309) and Rinaldo, also called Passerino (died 1328). Guido ruled until his death, having named Passerino his successor in 1308.
Taking power without opposition, Passerino raised the family to its greatest power. The emperor Henry VII (1269–1313) recognized him as signore (lord) of Mantua with the title of imperial vicar (1311). Passerino expanded the area under his control to include Modena and Carpi. He secured important positions for his sons Filippo (died 1303), bishop of Trento, Tagino (died 1302), and Zagnino, podesta of Verona (1274–77).
The tyrannical rule of the Bonacolsi finally provoked an insurrection (August 1328) led by the Gonzaga, who ousted the Bonacolsi from power and killed first Passerino and then his sons and nephews.
