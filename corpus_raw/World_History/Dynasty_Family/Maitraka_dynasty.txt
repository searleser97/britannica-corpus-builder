Maitraka dynasty,  Indian dynasty that ruled in Gujarat and Saurashtra (Kathiawar) from the 5th to the 8th century ce. Its founder, Bhatarka, was a general who, taking advantage of the decay of the Gupta empire, established himself as ruler of Gujarat and Saurashtra with Valabhi (modern Vala) as his capital. Although the early Maitraka kings were loosely feudatory to the Guptas, they were in fact independent. Under the powerful Shiladitya I (c. late 6th century), the kingdom became very influential; its rule extended into the regions of Malwa and Rajasthan. Later, however, the Maitrakas suffered at the hands of the Chalukyas of the Deccan and of the emperor Harsha of Kannauj. After Harshaâ€™s death the Maitrakas revived, but the Arabs who had established themselves in Sindh in 712 killed the last Maitraka king, Shiladitya VI, and razed his capital about 780.
Bhatarka and his successors were great patrons of religious foundations. Their kingdom was an important centre of Buddhism, and, according to tradition, it was in Valabhi that the Shvetambara Jaina canon was codified.
