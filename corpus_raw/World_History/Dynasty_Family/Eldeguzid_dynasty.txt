Eldegüzid dynasty, also spelled Ildigüzid, Ildegüzid, Ildegizid, or Ildenizid,  (1137–1225), Iranian atabeg dynasty of Turkish origin that ruled in Azerbaijan and Arrān (areas now in Iran and Azerbaijan).
The founder of the dynasty was Shams ad-Dīn Eldegüz (reigned c. 1137–75), originally a Turkish slave of the Seljuq minister Kamāl al-Mulk Simīrumī. In 1137 the Seljuq sultan Masʿūd I appointed Eldegüz ruler of the Seljuq provinces of Arrān and Azerbaijan. In 1161, shortly after he had married the widow of the Seljuq ruler Toghrïl II, Eldegüz was made atabeg (guardian) of his stepson, the infant Seljuq prince Arslan. During the next three decades the Eldegüzids, using their position as atabegs of Seljuq princes, expanded their territories in Iran as far south as Isfahan and northward in the Caucasus to the borders of Shīrvān and Georgia. In 1191 the Seljuq sultan Toghrïl III defeated and subjugated Qutlugh Inanj (reigned 1191–95), the fourth Eldegüzid ruler. Qutlugh had to retreat to Azerbaijan, where the Eldegüzids held their position until 1225, when the Khwārezm-Shāh, Jalāl ad-Dīn Mingburnu, took over the administration of their territories.
