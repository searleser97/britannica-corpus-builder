Mwene Matapa, (Shona: “Ravager of the Lands”) also spelled Mwene Mutapa or Monomotapa,  title borne by a line of kings ruling a southeast African territory between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers, in what is now Zimbabwe and Mozambique, from the 14th to the 17th century. Their domain was often called the empire of the Mwene Matapa, or simply Matapa (or Mutapa), and is associated with the historical site known as Zimbabwe, located in the southeastern part of modern Zimbabwe.
Oral traditions ascribe the dynasty’s foundation to Mbire, a semimythical ruler of the 14th century. His great-great-grandson Nyatsimba, who ruled in the late 15th century, was the actual creator of the empire and the first to bear the title Mwene Matapa. During his reign the centre of the state was shifted from Zimbabwe north to Mount Fura on the Zambezi River.
In the 16th century the Mwene Matapa’s realm was invaded by the Portuguese, who moved in from the east coast beginning in the 1530s. When the reigning Mwene Matapa attempted to expel them in 1629, they deposed him and forced his successor to grant them extensive trading and mining privileges. By the late 17th century, the power of the Mwene Matapa was overshadowed by the Rozwi kingdom of southwestern Rhodesia.
