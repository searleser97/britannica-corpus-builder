Candar Dynasty, , also called İsfendiyar,  Turkmen dynasty (c. 1290–1461) that ruled in the Kastamonu-Sinop region of northern Anatolia (now in Turkey).
The dynasty took its name from Şemseddin Yaman Candar, who served in the army of the Seljuq sultan Masʿūd II (reigned 1283–98) and was awarded the Eflani region, west of Kastamonu, in return for his services. Candar’s son Süleyman captured Kastamonu and Sinop and in 1314 accepted the suzerainty of the Il-Khans (western branch of the Mongols), until the breakdown of Il-Khanid power at the death of its ruler, Abū Saʿīd, in 1335.
About 1380, as a result of dynastic struggles, the principality was divided into two branches: Kastamonu and Sinop. The Kastamonu branch, which had accepted Ottoman suzerainty, was annexed by Sultan Bayezid I in 1391, while the Sinop branch remained under Candar rule. In 1402 the entire territory was restored to Candar by Timur (Tamerlane), the Central Asian conqueror of the Ottomans. Dynastic rivalries again caused a division of the principality in 1417, with one branch falling once more under Ottoman influence. In 1461 the entire principality was annexed by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II. Later members of the Candar dynasty served as governors of Ottoman provinces in Asia and in the Balkans.
Renowned for their patronage of men of letters, the Candar dynasty contributed to the development of Turkish as a literary language.
