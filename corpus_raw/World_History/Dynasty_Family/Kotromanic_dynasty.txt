Kotromanić Dynasty,   royal house that ruled Bosnia from the late 13th to the mid-15th century. The dynasty was founded by Stephen Kotroman, a vassal of the Hungarian king and the ruler of a portion of Bosnia from 1287 to 1316. His son Stephen Kotromanić became the independent lord of all Bosnia in 1322. Extending his domain southward, Stephen Kotromanić incorporated both the land of Hum (1325; later called Hercegovina) and the Adriatic coastline between Split and the Neretva River. Although challenged by Hungarian aggression and internal uprisings, his nephew and successor, Tvrtko I (reigned 1353–91), established firm control over a reduced Bosnia by 1370; he then recovered Bosnia’s lost territory, extended his lands along the Adriatic coast and into Serbia, and in 1377 crowned himself “king of the Serbs, of Bosnia, and of the coast.” By 1390 he had also claimed the titles “king of Dalmatia and Croatia” and had made Bosnia the dominant power among the South Slavs.
Under Tvrtko’s successors, however, constant dynastic quarrels and the increased influence of a few magnates diminished the authority of the throne; Hungarian and Turk intervention also reduced the size and undermined the independence of the Bosnian state until the Turks incorporated it into their empire (1463) and executed the last Kotromanić king, Stephen Tomašević (reigned 1461–63).
Tvrtko’s successors were his brother Stephen Dabiša (reigned 1391–95), Dabiša’s widow Jelena Gruba (1395–98), Tvrtko’s illegitimate son Stephen Ostoja (1398–1404, 1409–18), Tvrtko’s son Tvrtko II (1404–09, 1420–43), Ostoja’s son Stephen Ostojić (1418–20), Ostoja’s illegitimate son Stephen Tomas Ostojić (1443–61), and Stephen Tomašević.
