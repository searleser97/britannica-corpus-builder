Solomonid Dynasty, also called Solomonic Dynasty,  line of Ethiopian emperors who, according to tradition, were descended from Menilek I, the son of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (Makeda). Until Haile Selassie I was deposed in 1974, their rule was supposed to have been continuous but for two periods, the reign of the Zagwe dynasty (12th–13th century) and the reign of Tewodros II (1855–68). Many scholars, however, trace the line back only as far as Yekuno Amlak, who acceded to the throne in 1270. The genealogy of the Solomonids was first depicted in the 14th-century work Kebra Negast (“Glory of the Kings”).
