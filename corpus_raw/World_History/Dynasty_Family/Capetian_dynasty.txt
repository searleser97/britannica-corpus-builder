Capetian dynasty,  ruling house of France from 987 to 1328, during the feudal period of the Middle Ages. By extending and consolidating their power, the Capetian kings laid the foundation of the French nation-state.
The Capetians all descended from Robert the Strong (died 866), count of Anjou and of Blois, whose two sons, usually styled Robertian rather than Capetian, were both crowned king of the Franks: Eudes in 888, Robert I in 922. Though Robert I’s son Hugh the Great restored the Carolingian dynasty in 936, his son Hugh Capet  was elected king in 987, thus removing the Carolingians forever.
The 13 kings from Hugh Capet to the infant John I, who succeeded one another from father to son, and John I’s two uncles, Philip V and Charles IV (d. 1328), are designated as the Capetians “of the direct line.” They were followed by the 13 Capetian kings of the house of Valois (see Valois dynasty). Of these, seven kings (from Philip VI to Charles VIII) succeeded from father to son. Thereafter came the Valois-Orléans branch (represented by Louis XII) and the Valois-Angoulême branch (five kings from Francis I to Henry III) until 1589. Then the Capetians of Bourbon succeeded (see Bourbon, house of).
Hugh Capet’s rule was limited to his own domain around Paris, while the rest of the French kingdom was in the hands of powerful local lords. His direct successors gradually increased the territory over which they had control through conquest and inheritance and also by skillfully exploiting their rights as suzerains in areas not under their direct authority. Under the Capetians, many of the basic administrative institutions of the French monarchy, including Parlements (royal law courts), the States General (representative assembly), and the baillis (royal local officials), began to develop.
Among the most notable of the Capetians was Philip II (reigned 1180–1223), who wrested from the Angevin rulers of England much of the empire that they had built up in western France. Another notable Capetian was Louis IX, or Saint Louis (reigned 1226–70), whose devotion to justice and saintly life greatly enhanced the prestige of the monarchy.
Many other sovereign princes of medieval Europe descended in the male line from the Capetian kings of France. There were two lines of Capetian dukes of Burgundy (1032–1361 and 1363–1477); the Capetian house of Dreux, a line of dukes of Brittany (1213–1488); three Capetian emperors of Constantinople (1216–61), of the house of Courtenay; various counts of Artois (from 1237), with controversial succession; the first Capetian house of Anjou, with kings and queens of Naples (1266–1435) and kings of Hungary (1310–82); the house of Évreux, with three kings of Navarre (1328–1425); the second Capetian house of Anjou, with five counts of Provence (1382–1481); and other lesser branches.
