Barīd Shāhī dynasty,  the rulers of the small state of Bidar (now in Karnataka state in southwestern India) from about 1487 until 1619. The Barīd family were ministers of the Muslim Bahmanī sultans of the Deccan, who in 1430 made their capital at Bidar.
About 1492 the Bahmanī kingdom disintegrated, but the sultans retained a small principality around Bidar. Real power was by then in the hands of Amir Qāsim Barīd, and his grandson ʿAlī Barīd assumed the royal title in 1542. The kingdom was absorbed by the larger Deccan kingdom of Bijapur in 1619.
