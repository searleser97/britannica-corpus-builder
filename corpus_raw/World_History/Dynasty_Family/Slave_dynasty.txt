Slave dynasty,  (1206–90), line of sultans at Delhi, India, that lasted for nearly a century. Their family name was Muiʿzzī.
The Slave dynasty was founded by Quṭb al-Dīn Aibak, a favourite slave of the Muslim general and later sultan Muḥammad of Ghūr. Quṭb al-Dīn had been among Muḥammad’s most trusted Turkish officers and had overseen his master’s Indian conquests. When Muḥammad was assassinated in 1206, Quṭb took power in Lahore. He managed to consolidate his position in a seesawing war with a rival Slave ruler, Tāj al-Dīn Yildoiz, during which he captured and lost Ghazna. He was eventually confined to being a purely Indian sovereign. He died in 1210 as a result of a polo accident, and the crown shortly passed to Iltutmish, his son-in-law.
By the time of Iltutmish’s accession, the family’s holdings had been severely reduced. Iltutmish, the greatest of the Slave kings, defeated and put to death Yildoiz (1216), restored the Bengal governor to obedience, and added considerable new territory to the empire, including the Lower Sindh.
After the death of Iltutmish, his able daughter Raziyya attempted to serve as sultan but was defeated by opposing Turkish Slave nobles. After 1246 the sultanate was controlled by Ghiyās al-Dīn Balban, who was to be sultan himself from 1266 to 1287. Under Balban the Delhi sultanate fought off several Mongol invasions. The Slave dynasty ended when Jalāl al-Dīn Fīrūz Khaljī staged a successful coup on June 13, 1290, and brought the Khaljīs to power.
