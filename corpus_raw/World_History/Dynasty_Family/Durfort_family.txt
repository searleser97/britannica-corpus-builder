Durfort Family,   French noble family of prominence in the 17th and 18th centuries.
The family, which can be traced back to the 11th century, claims as a member Guy Aldonce I de Durfort (1605–65), Marquis de Duras, who raised three famous sons: Jacques Henri I (1625–1704), marshal of France (1675) and Duke de Duras (1689); Guy Aldonce II (1630–1702), marshal of France (1676) and Duke de Quintin (1691); and Louis (1638–1709), who went to England and became 2nd Earl of Feversham in 1677. Jacques Henri’s second son, Jean Baptiste (1684–1770), became marshal of France in 1741 and in 1775 was succeeded by his son, Emmanuel Félicité (1715–89), whose grandson, Amédée Bretagne Malo (1771–1838), married the author Claire de Kersaint (1779–1829).
