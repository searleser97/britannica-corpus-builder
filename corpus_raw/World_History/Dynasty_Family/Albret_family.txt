Albret Family,   Gascon family celebrated in French history. The lords (sires) of Albret included warriors, cardinals, and kings of Navarre, reaching the height of their power in the 14th to 16th century. Their name derives from Labrit, a small village on the road from Bordeaux to Dax and Bayonne. The family gradually acquired more land through marriages and grants.
Members of the family fought in the First Crusade (1096–99), in the war against the Albigensian heretics in southern France (1209–29), and in the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453). In this conflict Arnaud-Amanieu d’Albret (d. 1401) fought for some time for the English but finally changed to the French side and was richly rewarded (1368): King Charles V gave him not only his sister-in-law, Marguerite de Bourbon, but also lands and financial compensation. His son, Charles I d’Albret, constable of France, died at the Battle of Agincourt (1415).
Charles I’s grandson, Alain, was known as Alain le Grand (1440–1522). The surname refers not to his deeds but to the vast domains over which he ruled as one of the last feudal lords. A daughter, Charlotte (1480–1514), was married to Cesare Borgia. Alain’s son, Jean (d. 1516), became king of Navarre through his marriage with Catherine de Foix in 1484. In 1550 the lands of Albret were made a duchy. Jeanne d’Albret (1528–72), Jean’s granddaughter, married Antoine de Bourbon and left her titles to her son, Henry III of Navarre, who became king of France as Henry IV. A member of the Miossans branch of the family, César-Phébus d’Albret (1614–76), was made marshal of France in 1654.
