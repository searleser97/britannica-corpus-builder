Achaemenid Dynasty,  the Persian 27th dynasty of Egypt (525–404 bc), founded by Cambyses II of Persia and named after his family of the Achaemenids.
The policy of the Achaemenid kings seems to have been conciliatory to national beliefs and sentiments. There are conflicting views of Cambyses II’s reign. The Egyptian courtier Udjahorresne depicts an ideal ruler in the pharaonic tradition, while Herodotus draws a portrait of a savage tyrant. Cambyses II apparently reduced the revenues given the Egyptian priesthood by more than half. Certainly Darius (reigned 522–486 bc) proved himself a more beneficent ruler and, in a visit to Egypt, displayed his consideration for the religion of the country. He restored the priests’ privileges, ordered a written codification of Egyptian law, and completed or repaired the canal from the Nile to the Red Sea. At the very end of his reign, however, several years after the Achaemenid defeat at Marathon, Egypt rebelled. Xerxes (reigned 486–465 bc) put down the revolt with severity.
The disorders that marked the accession of his successor, Artaxerxes (reigned 466–424 bc), gave Egypt another opportunity to rebel, aided by an Athenian force. In 455 bc, however, the Achaemenids captured and destroyed two Athenian fleets and quickly ended the rebellion. The reigns of Xerxes II and Darius II were uneventful until 404 bc, when Egypt regained its independence under Amyrtaeus of Sais. The Persians briefly reconquered Egypt under Artaxerxes III between 343 and 341 bc, and it remained under Achaemenid rule until 332, when the satrap surrendered to Alexander the Great.
