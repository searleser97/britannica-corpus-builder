Nizam Shāhī dynasty,  succession of rulers of the kingdom of Ahmadnagar in the Deccan of India from 1490 to 1633. The founder was Malik Aḥmad, who in 1490 fixed his capital on a new site called Ahmadnagar after himself. The kingdom lay in the northwestern Deccan, between the states of Gujarat and Bijapur. It secured the great fortress of Daulatabad in 1499 and added Berar in 1574.
The Nizam Shāhī dynasty was engaged in constant warfare. Burhān Shah (reigned 1509–53) allied with the Hindu state of Vijayanagar, but his successor Husain (reigned 1553–65) joined the alliance that overthrew it (1565). An attack by the Mughals from the north was gallantly resisted by Chand Bibi, queen dowager of Bijapur, but Berar was ceded (1596) and Ahmadnagar fell after the queen’s death (1600). A part of the state of Ahmadnagar remained, and the dynasty survived until the fall of Daulatabad, in 1633.
