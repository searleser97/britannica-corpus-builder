Shunga dynasty,  Indian ruling house founded by Pushyamitra about 185 bce, which replaced the Mauryan dynasty. Pushyamitra assassinated Brihadratha, the last Mauryan ruler, at a military parade and assumed royal power. Pushyamitra was a Brahman, and, though he is said to have persecuted Buddhists, Buddhism still flourished in many areas under his control.
Most of the traditional accounts of Pushyamitra’s reign are late in date. According to these, his rule extended over the cities of Pataliputra, Ayodhya (Oudh), and Vidisha and perhaps over Jalandhara and Shakala as well. The Mauryan system of administering the provinces through princes of royal blood continued, and royal power tended to decentralize in the form of the establishment of nuclear kingdoms within the empire. Pushyamitra conducted several campaigns against the Yavanas, Indo-Greeks, who were trying in this period to expand from Bactria into northwestern India.
Shunga history after Pushyamitra, who ruled for roughly 36 years, is largely uncertain. Nothing substantial is known about his successor, Agnimitra, the hero of Kalidasa’s play Malavikagnimitra. According to the Puranas (Hindu writings), Agnimitra’s successors, in genealogical order, were Sujyestha (or Vasujyestha), Vasumitra, Andhraka (or Bhadraka), Pulindaka, Ghosa, Vajramitra, Bhagavata, and Devabhumi (Devabhuti). If the Puranic account is to be believed, the total tenure of Shunga rule was 112 years, coming to an end about 73 bce.
