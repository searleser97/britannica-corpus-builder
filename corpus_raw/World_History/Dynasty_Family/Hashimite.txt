Hashemite, also called Hāshimī,  any of the Arab descendants, either direct or collateral, of the prophet Muhammad, from among whom came the family that created the 20th-century Hashemite dynasty. Muhammad himself was a member of the house of Hāshim (Hashem), a subdivision of the Quraysh tribe. The most revered line of Hashemites passed through Ḥasan, son of the Prophet’s daughter Fāṭimah and her husband, ʿAlī, the fourth caliph. Ḥasan was the last of this line to hold disputed claim to the caliphate, but his progeny eventually established themselves as hereditary emirs of Mecca, the role continuing under Ottoman rule. Of such stock were Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, emir of Mecca and king of Hejaz from 1916 to 1924, and his sons Fayṣal and ʿAbdullāh, who became kings of Iraq and Jordan, respectively, founding the modern Hashemite dynasty.
