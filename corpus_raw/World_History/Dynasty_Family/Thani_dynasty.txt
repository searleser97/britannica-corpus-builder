Thani dynasty, Arabic Āl Thānī (“Thani family”),  ruling family of Qatar. The family is from the Tamīm tribe, which migrated eastward from central Arabia to the Qatar peninsula and emerged as a dominant ruling family in the mid-19th century. The second sheikh, Qāsim ibn Muḥammad (1878–1913), is considered Qatar’s founder. The seventh sheikh, Khalifa ibn Hamad (1972–95), was instrumental in obtaining Qatar’s independence from Britain in 1971 and became the first emir. His son, Hamad ibn Khalifa (1995–2013), oversaw the Gulf state’s shift away from oil production toward the development of a robust industry in liquefied natural gas. The shift helped Tamim ibn Hamad (2013– ) navigate rifts with Qatar’s oil-producing neighbours and carve out a direction in policy for the country that was independent of the other Gulf dynasties. The clan is especially large among the ruling families of the Gulf states: numbering in the tens of thousands, they make up the plurality of Qatari citizenry.
