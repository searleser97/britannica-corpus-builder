Jahwarid dynasty,  Muslim Arab dynasty that ruled Córdoba, Spain, after the dissolution of the Umayyad caliphate of Córdoba (1031), one of the party kingdoms (ṭāʾifahs). Years of civil war following the breakdown of central caliphal authority in 1008 prompted the Cordoban council of notables, led by a prominent aristocrat, Abū al-Ḥazm Jahwar ibn Jahwar, to abolish the institution of the caliphate and proclaim Córdoba a republic. Jahwar was elected head and, as virtually an absolute sovereign ostensibly assisted by a council, restored peace and economic prosperity in his 12-year-reign (1031–43). His son Abū al-Walīd Muḥammad al-Rashīd (reigned 1043–58) managed through political chicanery to keep the ʿAbbādids of Sevilla (Seville) out of Córdoba but eventually resigned his authority to his own vizier, Ibn al-Raqā. When ʿAbd al-Malik, al-Rashīd’s jealous son, assassinated the vizier in 1058, his father rewarded him with virtually caliphal standing and authority in the state. Extremely unpopular, ʿAbd al-Malik and his father were handed over to the ʿAbbādids by the Cordobans themselves when the Abbādids took the city in 1069.
