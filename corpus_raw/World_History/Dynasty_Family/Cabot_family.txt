Cabot family,  prominent American family since the arrival of John Cabot at Salem, Massachusetts, in 1700. The Cabot family has enjoyed a long tradition of wealth, philanthropy, and talent.
John and his son Joseph were highly successful merchants. They traded rum but also trafficked enslaved persons and operated a fleet of privateers. Moreover, in the 19th century the Cabots’ exploitative business ventures came to include involvement in the opium trade. Joseph’s son George Cabot furthered the family fortune, but he is best remembered for his political career—especially his leadership of the Federalist Party, the Essex Junto, and the Hartford Convention.
Over the generations, the Cabots moved from Salem to Beverly to Boston, Massachusetts. Intermarriage with other wealthy Boston families produced a socially cohesive aristocracy: the Brahmins. Well-known Brahmins of Cabot descent include Francis Cabot Lowell, Arthur Tracy Cabot, Richard Clarke Cabot, Edward Clarke Cabot, Godfrey Lowell Cabot, Henry Cabot Lodge, and the latter’s grandson Henry Cabot Lodge.
Family members have distinguished themselves in medicine, architecture, politics, and philanthropy. Massachusetts General Hospital, the Boston Symphony, and Harvard University are only a few of the beneficiaries of Cabot wealth.
