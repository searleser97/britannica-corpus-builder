Percy Family,  English family renowned in history and ballad for its role in medieval, Tudor, and Stuart times.
The family was founded by William de Percy (c. 1030–96), a follower of William I the Conqueror, who bestowed on him a great fief in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. His grandson William (d. 1175) was the last of the house in the direct line, leaving two daughters and coheiresses, Maud, who died childless, and Agnes. Agnes de Percy married Josceline de Leuven, and from this marriage descended the second house of Percy (which name it assumed), until its own extinction in the male line five centuries later (1670).
A descendant of the union of Agnes and Josceline, Henry de Percy (1273–1314) was one of Edward I’s most active agents in the subjugation of Scotland until the success of Robert de Bruce made him withdraw into England. Summoned to Parliament as a baron in the time of Edward I, he later, as one of the lords ordainer, supported the baronial opposition to the personal rule of Edward II. Hitherto the family had been mainly connected with Yorkshire, but Henry gave its fortunes a new direction by his purchase of lands in Northumberland. Henceforth the Percys, now the greatest landowners in Northumberland, became the principal guardians of the northeastern border against the Scots, and successive members of the family served regularly as wardens of the Scottish Marches.
Henry Percy (1341–1408), marshal of England, was created Earl of Northumberland at Richard II’s coronation in 1377. He served Richard in numerous capacities but after 1398 supported the Duke of Hereford (afterward Henry IV) and took a prominent part in Richard’s abdication. His son, Sir Henry Percy, known as Hotspur, figures prominently in William Shakespeare’s history play 1 Henry IV. Hotspur was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury (1403) fighting Henry IV; and his father, Northumberland, after being attainted in 1406 for plotting against Henry IV, was slain at Bramham Moore (Feb. 19, 1408). The Percys were Lancastrians and Henry (1393–1455), 2nd Earl of Northumberland and Hotspur’s son, was slain at the first battle of St. Albans fighting for Henry VI; while Henry (1421–61), the 3rd earl, fell at the Battle of Towton (1461). The earldom was then briefly given to John Neville but returned to the Percys in 1470 when Henry (c. 1449–89), son of the 3rd earl, was restored as the 4th earl by Edward IV. The 4th earl acquiesced in the accession of Richard III and submitted to Henry VII, with whom he found favour. Henry (1478–1527), the 5th earl, known as the Magnificent, was prominent in the early years of Henry VIII. The earldom lapsed in 1537 on the death of Henry (c. 1502–37), the 6th earl, whose brother was attainted for his role in the revolt known as the Pilgrimage of Grace (1536).
The earldom of Northumberland was restored to the Percy family in 1557 and continued in the male line until 1670. Thomas (1528–72), the 7th earl, was beheaded for his part in the northern rebellion (1569) which aimed to release Mary Stuart and give toleration to Roman Catholics. Henry (c. 1532–85), the 8th earl, also suspected of pro-Catholic plotting, was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he was found shot in 1585. Henry (1564–1632), the 9th earl, was imprisoned in the Tower from 1605 to 1621 on suspicion of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, because his cousin, Thomas Percy, was one of the chief conspirators. Algernon (1602–68), the 10th earl, was opposed to the trial of Charles I and took no part in affairs under the Commonwealth and urged moderation after the Restoration. On the death of his son, Joceline (1644–70), the 11th earl, the male line of the Percys of Northumberland became extinct.
