Igarashi Family,   (flourished 17th century), Japanese lacquerware artists who specialized in the maki-e technique, wherein a design is made by sprinkling minute gold, silver, or copper flakes over a lacquer ground. The founder of the Igarashi family, Shinsai, contributed to the art by perfecting two techniques of lacquer design. The taka-maki-e technique employs a mixture of lacquer putty, white lead, lampblack, powder, camphor, and gold or silver foil in relief against a lacquer ground. In the nashiji method, numerous layers of lacquer, each sprinkled with tiny flakes of gold or silver, are superimposed and polished to produce an effect like that of the skin of a golden or brown pear. Shinsai’s son, Hosai, served the military ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi, while his grandson Dōho worked for the Maeda family in Kaga province (now Ishikawa prefecture), creating the Kaga maki-e lacquer design. The name Dōho and the family’s association with the Maeda clan were continued by Dōho’s son and grandson.
