Bāvand Dynasty, also spelled Bāvend,   (665–1349), Iranian dynasty that ruled Ṭabaristān in what is now northern Iran.
The Bāvands ruled, sometimes independently and at other times as vassals of various Islāmic dynasties, over an area delimited by the Caspian Sea and the Elburz Mountains. The geographic isolation of Bāvand territories permitted a degree of historical continuity.
The origins and early years of the dynasty are clouded by myth and legend. The Bāvands can be divided into three distinct lines: the Kāʾūsīyeh (665–c. 1006), the Espahbadīyeh (1074–1210), and the Kīnkhvārīyeh (c. 1238–1349).
The first line, the Kāʾūsīyeh, ruled independently over their mountainous kingdom. In 854 they were converted to Islām. In the 10th century their power weakened; they maintained their position by various marriage alliances with the Zeyārid dynasty of northern Iran, but from 1006 they became vassals of that dynasty.
The Espahbadīyeh line, centred at Sārī, was originally a tributary of the Seljuq dynasty. Rostam I (reigned 1140–63) reasserted the independence of the Bāvand dynasty, but soon afterward, with the assassination of Shams ol-Molk Rostam II (reigned 1206–10), the Espahbadīyeh line was vanquished by the Khwārezm-Shāh dynasty.
The third, or Kīnkhvārīyeh, line was founded by Ḥosām od-Dowleh (reigned 1238–49) and was centred at Āmol. It was a vassal of the Il-Khanid rulers of Iran. This line was finally extinguished with the assassination of Fakr od-Dowleh (reigned 1334–49).
