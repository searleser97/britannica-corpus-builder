Adams family,  Massachusetts family with deep roots in American history whose members made major contributions to the nation’s political and intellectual life for more than 150 years.
Established in America by Henry Adams, who emigrated from England to Massachusetts Bay Colony about 1636, the family made no special mark until the time of John Adams (1735–1826). Perhaps the most profound political philosopher of the Revolutionary and early national periods of U.S. history, Adams also served as the country’s second president (1797–1801). His wife, Abigail Adams (1744–1818), left a voluminous correspondence testifying to her wit, literary capabilities, and political insight. John’s cousin Samuel Adams (1722–1803) was the firebrand of Revolutionary Boston, constantly organizing protests against British policies and shrewdly directing public opinion toward the goal of independence.
John Quincy Adams (1767–1848), son of John and Abigail, like his father served four unhappy years as president of the United States (1825–29). More than for his presidency, perhaps, he is best remembered for his diplomatic skills, which resulted in the acquisition of Florida and in the Monroe Doctrine, and for his heroic championing of antislavery petitions while a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. His son, Charles Francis Adams (1807–86), continued the battle against slavery as a congressman and as a leader of the Free-Soil Party. During the Civil War he demonstrated his own diplomatic genius while U.S. minister to Great Britain, preventing British recognition of and possible alliance with the Confederacy.
Except for a grandson of Charles Francis Adams—Charles Francis Adams III (1866–1954), who served as secretary of the navy during the presidential administration of Herbert Hoover—subsequent generations of the Adams family refrained from participation in public life. Charles Francis Adams, Jr. (1835–1915), was a historian, civic leader, and railroad expert who for a time was president of the Union Pacific Railroad and who later retired to write a biography of his father and books on other historical subjects. His two brothers, Henry (Brooks) Adams (1838–1918) and Brooks Adams (1848–1927), were also historians, as well as profound social critics. Henry Adams, in particular, ranks as one of the great post-Civil War American writers. Other Adamses have been prominent lawyers, financiers, and corporation executives.
