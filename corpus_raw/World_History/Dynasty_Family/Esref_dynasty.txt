Eşref Dynasty, also spelled Ashraf,  Turkmen dynasty (c. 1290–c. 1326) that ruled in Beyşehir, west of Konya in central Anatolia. 
The dynasty traced its origins to a Turkmen tribe that was settled by the Seljuqs of Anatolia on the western frontier. The family’s founder, Eşref oğlu Sayfeddin Süleyman I, was a Seljuq emir who played an important role in Seljuq dynastic struggles during the reign (1283–98) of the Seljuq sultan Masʿūd II. Süleyman was appointed regent to the sons of the deposed Seljuq sultan, Ghiyāth ad-Dīn Kay-Khusraw, by Masʿūd’s opponents in 1285, but he submitted to Masʿūd when the sultan consolidated his power. Later Süleyman I assisted Masʿūd against the latter’s brother Siyāwush.
Süleyman’s son Mehmed captured Akşehir and Bolvadin and in 1314 accepted Il-Khanid (western Mongol) suzerainty. He was succeeded by his son Süleyman II, whose reign coincided with an attempt by Demirtaş, the Il-Khanid governor of Anatolia, to assert his authority over the independent Turkmen rulers in Anatolia. About 1326 Demirtaş marched to Beyşehir and killed Süleyman II, putting an end to the Eşref principality. Later its territories were divided between the Karaman and Hamid principalities.
