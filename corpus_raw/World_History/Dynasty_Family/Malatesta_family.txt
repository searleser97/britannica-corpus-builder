Malatesta Family,   Italian family that ruled Rimini, south of Ravenna, in the European Middle Ages and led the region’s Guelf (papal) party. Originating as feudal lords of the Apennine hinterland, the family became powerful in Rimini in the 13th century, when Malatesta da Verucchio (d. 1312) expelled Ghibelline (imperial party) leaders in 1295 and became lord of the city. Possibly the best-known episode in Malatesta history centres on his son Gianciotto (d. 1304), who killed his wife, Francesca da Polenta, and his brother Paolo for adultery, an event recorded by Dante. By the time of the arrival of the papal legate Cardinal Albornoz in the area in 1353, the Malatesta had extended their power as far as Ascoli, 100 miles (160 km) south. Albornoz forced them to surrender many of their conquests but allowed them to remain as papal vicars in Rimini and other nearby cities (1355).
The Malatesta were active in the 14th- and 15th-century wars of the Visconti family of Milan. Carlo Malatesta (d. 1429) governed the Milanese state for a time after the death of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, while his brother Pandolfo (d. 1427) seized Brescia (1404) and Bergamo (1408) but had to relinquish them in 1421. Carlo was associated with Pope Gregory XII at the end of the Great Schism, and he presented Gregory’s formal renunciation of the papacy at the Council of Constance in 1416. Carlo’s nephew, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta (1417–68), often regarded as the prototype of the Italian Renaissance prince, was a soldier who earned a reputation as a patron of writers and artists. Malatesta power was diminished by the end of the Great Schism (1417) and the growing power of the papacy. In 1461 Pope Pius II launched a crusade against Sigismondo and deprived the Malatesta of most of their dominions. After Sigismondo’s death, his son Roberto il Magnifico (d. 1482) seized Rimini (1469) from his half brother Sallustio, though at the price of increased dependence on Venice. Meanwhile, the Malatesta family lost all popular support in Rimini. Forced to flee in 1500, when Cesare Borgia marched on the city, they were unsuccessful in three subsequent attempts to return, in 1503, 1522, and 1527–28.
