Hohenlohe Family,   German princely family which took its name from the district of Hohenlohe in Franconia. First mentioned in the 12th century as possessing the castle of Hohenloch or Hohenlohe, near Uffenheim, the family soon extended its influence over several of the Franconian valleys, including those of the Kocher, the Jagst, and the Tauber. Henry I (d. 1183) was the first to take the title of count of Hohenlohe, and in 1230 his grandsons Gottfried and Conrad, supporters of the emperor Frederick II, founded the lines of Hohenlohe—Hohenlohe and Hohenlohe-Brauneck. The latter became extinct in 1390, while the former was divided into several branches—the branches themselves dividing into further branches. One branch, the line of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein, which became Protestant during the Reformation, did not receive the rank of princes of the Holy Roman Empire until 1764. Another branch, the line of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg, which remained Catholic, attained princely rank in 1744.
