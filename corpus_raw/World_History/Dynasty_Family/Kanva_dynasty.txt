Kanva dynasty, also called Kanvayanas,  the successors of the Shungas in the North Indian kingdom of Magadha, who ruled about 72–28 bce; like their predecessors, they were Brahmans in origin. That they originally served the Shunga line is attested by the appellation Shungabhrityas (i.e., servants of the Shungas) given to them in the Puranas. The Brahman minister Vasudeva, the founder of the line, is stated to have served Shunga Devabhumi (Devabhuti). Bana, the 7th-century Sanskrit author, gives details of an assassination plot that cost Devabhumi his life and brought Vasudeva to power in  about 72 bce.
The brief spell of Kanva rule is otherwise known entirely on the strength of Puranic evidence, according to which Vasudeva’s successors, in the following genealogical order, were Bhumimitra, Narayana, and Susarman. Kanva rule, which, according to the Puranas, came to a close as a result of the rise to power of Andhra Simuka (an early ruler of the Satavahana dynasty), seems to have lasted until  about 28 bce.
