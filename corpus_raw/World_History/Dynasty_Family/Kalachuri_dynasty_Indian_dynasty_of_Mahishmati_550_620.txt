Kalachuri dynasty,  any of several dynasties in Indian history, disparately placed in time and space. Apart from the dynastic name and perhaps a belief in common ancestry, there is little in known sources to connect them.
The earliest known Kalachuri family (c. 550–620 ce) ruled in northern Maharashtra, Gujarat, Malwa, and parts of the western Deccan and probably had their capital at Mahishmati in the Narmada River valley. Three members of the family—Krishnaraja, Shankaragana, and Buddharaja—are known from epigraphs and coins distributed over a wide area. Although the rise of the Badami Chalukyas ended Kalachuri power in the early 7th century, the dynasty seems to have lingered in the Malwa region until a late date.
Another Kalachuri dynasty rose to power in the Deccan from 1156 to 1181. This family traced its origin to Krishna, conqueror of Kalanjara and Dahala in Madhya Pradesh, but its authority in Karnataka was established by Bijjala, who originally served as a feudatory of the Kalyani Chalukyas at Banavasi, Nolambapadi, and Tarddevadi and wrested power from Chalukya Taila III. The Kalachuris held power in Karnataka during the reigns of Bijjala’s sons Someshvara and Sankama, but after 1181 Ahavamalla and Singhana, two other sons of Bijjala, gradually surrendered authority back to the Chalukyas. Despite its brevity, the Kalachuri period in Karnataka is historically important because it coincides with the rise of the Lingayat, or Virashaiva, Hindu sect.
The best-known Kalachuri family in Indian history ruled in central India, with its base at the ancient city of Tripuri (modern Tewar). Its origin is placed about the beginning of the 8th century, but little is known of its early history. The line comes into clearer focus only with Kokalla I (reigned c. 850–885). The period between Kokalla I and Kokalla II (reigned c. 990–1015) is marked by a consolidation of Kalachuri power and by their relations with contemporary dynasties. The success attributed to Kokalla I against the Pratiharas, the Kalachuris of Uttar Pradesh, the Guhilas of Marwar, the Chauhans (Chahamanas) of Shakambhari, and the kings of Vanga and Konkan appears somewhat exaggerated. Matrimonial relations with the powerful Rashtrakuta family of the Deccan remained uninterrupted for some time, and the Kalachuris were at times involved in Rashtrakuta politics, as in the period of Yuvaraja I (reigned c. 915–945). Between the mid-9th and the early 11th centuries, the Kalachuris pursued a policy of traditional hostility toward the kingdoms of south Kosala, Kalinga, Gauda, and Vanga; occasional clashes with the Gurjaras, the Chandelas, the Eastern Chalukyas, the Gujarat Chalukyas, and others are mentioned in their records.
These military exploits, however, did not produce any substantial results until the period of Gangeyadeva (reigned c. 1015–41), who, besides achieving success against the traditional rivals Daksinakoshala and Orissa, pushed northward to acquire the Varanasi area at the expense of the Palas; he also had substantial success against the Chalukyas of Kalyani (between the Bhima and Godavari rivers). The reign of Gangeyadeva’s son Karna (reigned 1041–73) represents a high point in contemporary military adventurism. He consolidated his power in the Varanasi-Allahabad area and undertook large-scale military campaigns in eastern, southern, central, and western India. His successes were short-lived, however, and Kalachuri power declined steadily in the period between Yashahkarna (reigned 1073–1123) and Vijayasimha (reigned c. 1188–1209). The neighbouring Gahadavalas, Paramaras, and Chandelas started encroaching on the Kalachuri kingdom, and soon after 1211 Baghelkhand and almost all Dahalamandala were incorporated into the Chandela kingdom.
Two other Kalachuri families are known to history: the Kalachuris of Sarayupara and the Kalachuris of Ratanpur. The Sarayupara family ruled a territory along the banks of the Sarayu (modern Ghaghara) River, in the Bahraich and Gonda regions of Uttar Pradesh. The family originated in the late 8th century and lasted until the last quarter of the 11th century, when its kingdom extended from the Ghaghara River to the Gandak River and included the cities of Bahraich, Gonda, Basti, and Gorakhpur.
The Ratanpur Kalachuris, who first ruled from Tummana and later from Ratanpur (16 miles [26 km] north of Bilaspur), were distantly related to, and feudatories of, the Tripuri Kalachuris. Beginning to rule in the early 11th century, they gained prominence under Jajalladeva I in the early 12th century. Early historical documents of their rule continue to Pratapamalla (reigned c. 1188–1217) and are then interrupted until the 15th century, by which time the family had split into two branches—Ratanpur and Raipur. No authentic historical document relating to their history after the 15th century is known.
