Āl Bū Saʿīd dynasty, also spelled Al Busaidi,  Muslim dynasty of Oman, in southeastern Arabia (c. 1749 to the present), and of Zanzibar, in East Africa (c. 1749–1964).
Aḥmad ibn Saʿīd, who had been governor of Ṣuḥār, Oman, in the 1740s under the Persian Yaʿrubids, managed to displace the Yaʿrubids by about 1749 and become imam of Oman and of Zanzibar, Pemba, and Kilwa in East Africa. His successors—known as sayyids or, later, as sultans—expanded their possessions in the late 18th century to include Bahrain in the Persian Gulf and Bandar-e ʿAbbās, Hormuz, and Qeshm (all in Iran). In 1798 the threat of the militant Wahhābīs (a fundamentalist Islamic sect in central Arabia) caused Sulṭān ibn Aḥmad (reigned 1792–1804) to conclude a treaty with the East India Company that would assure a British presence in Muscat (Masqaṭ), the Āl Bū Saʿīdī capital, which was an important port on the trade route to India.
Under Saʿīd ibn Sulṭān (reigned 1806–56), the Āl Bū Saʿīd family reached the peak of its influence. Saʿīd established treaties with the United States (1833) and France (1844), strengthened his ties with Great Britain, and placed the East African Arab and Swahili colonies from Mogadishu (Muqdisho) to Cape Delgado under his suzerainty. The equilibrium of the sultanate was still threatened by Wahhābī attacks and tribal unrest in the mountains, but, with British aid, Saʿīd kept them in check. In 1854, out of gratitude for such support, the sayyid gave Great Britain the Khuriyā Muriyā Islands.
On Saʿīd’s death in 1856, the Āl Bū Saʿīdī dominions were divided by the British between Saʿīd’s two sons: Oman came under Thuwaynī’s rule (1856–66), while Zanzibar went to Mājid (reigned 1856–70). In Zanzibar the Āl Bū Saʿīd family remained in power even under the British protectorate (1890–1963) but were overthrown in 1964 when Zanzibar was incorporated into Tanzania.
In Oman an opposition movement that was organized in the mountains in 1901 by ʿĪsā ibn Ṣāliḥ threatened the Āl Bū Saʿīd family until a treaty, known as the Treaty of Al-Sib (September 25, 1920), was signed between Imam ʿĪsā ibn Ṣāliḥ and Sultan Taymūr ibn Fayṣal (reigned 1913–32), by virtue of which Sultan Taymūr ruled over the coastal provinces and Imam ʿĪsā over the interior. Opposition broke out again in 1954 when the tribes appealed to Saudi Arabia for aid in establishing an independent principality, but Sultan Saʿīd ibn Taymūr (reigned 1932–70) was able to put down the rebellion with British aid.
In the mid-1960s a Marxist-led rebellion broke out in the southern Dhofar region; this and other concerns eventually prompted the ouster of Sultan Saʿīd by his son, Qaboos bin Said (Qābūs ibn Saʿīd; reigned 1970–2020). Qaboos began the first programs to modernize Oman’s infrastructure, social programs, and government bureaucracy. The sultanate adopted a foreign policy that encouraged foreign investment, maintained ties with British and American interests, and aligned itself with the moderate Arab powers.
Qaboos died without issue in 2020, but, in a letter opened posthumously, he named as his successor Haitham bin Tariq (reigned 2020– ), his cousin through Taymūr. Haitham was expected to continue Qaboos’s policies, having served as a prominent figure in Qaboos’s cabinet both in a diplomatic capacity and in national development planning.
