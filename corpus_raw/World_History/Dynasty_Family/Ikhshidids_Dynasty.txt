Ikhshīdids Dynasty,  Muslim Turkish dynasty from Fergana in Central Asia that ruled Egypt and Syria from 935 to 969. The founder, Muḥammad ibn Ṭughj, appointed governor of Egypt in 935, two years later obtained the title ikhshīd (Persian: “prince, ruler”) from the ʿAbbāsid caliph ar-Rāḍī; he then secured his position in Egypt and Syria against opposition from Muḥammad ibn Rāʾiq, ʿAbbāsid amīr al-umarāʾ (commander in chief), and the Ḥamdānid Sayf ad-Dawlah of Aleppo. From 946 until 968, real governmental power rested in the hands of the vizier, Abū al-Misk Kāfūr, though Ibn Ṭughj’s sons Ūnūjūr and ʿAlī remained nominal rulers. Kāfūr, originally a black slave from either Ethiopia or the Sudan, successfully restrained Fāṭimid and Ḥamdānid intrusions into his territories; he also patronized learning and the arts, briefly boasting the presence of the eminent poet al-Mutanabbī in his court. In 969 the Fāṭimids overthrew the last of the Ikhshīdid rulers, a boy named Abū al-Fawāris Aḥmad, grandson of the founder, while the Ḥamdānids drove the Ikhshīdī governors from northern Syria.
