Condé family,  important French branch of the house of Bourbon, whose members played a significant role in French dynastic politics. The line began with Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé (1530–69), a military leader of the Huguenots in France’s Wars of Religion. The family’s most prominent member was the 4th prince de Condé, Louis II de Bourbon, one of Louis XIV’s greatest generals. The princely line died out when Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé (1772–1804), duc d’Enghien and sole heir of the 9th and last prince de Condé (Louis-Henri-Joseph), was falsely arrested and, on Napoleon’s orders, shot for treason.
