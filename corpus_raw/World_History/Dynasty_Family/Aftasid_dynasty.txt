Afṭasid dynasty,  Muslim Berber dynasty that ruled one of the party kingdoms (ṭāʾifahs) at Badajoz in western Spain (1022–94) in the period of disunity after the demise of the Umayyad caliphate of Córdoba. The Lower Frontier (modern central Portugal) had enjoyed a measure of autonomy after the death of the Umayyad caliph al-Ḥakam II (976), when it was ruled by his freed slave, Sābūr (976–1022). In 1022, at Sābūr’s death, his minister ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad ibn Maslamah, who was known as Ibn al-Afṭas, seized control of the kingdom and, assuming the title Al-Manṣūr Billāh (“Victorious by God”), ruled fairly peacefully until 1045. But trouble with the neighbouring ʿAbbādids of Sevilla (Seville), which had begun at the end of al-Manṣūr’s rule, consumed the energies of his son Muḥammad al-Muẓaffar (reigned 1045–60). Constant warfare weakened Badajoz sufficiently to allow the Christian king Ferdinand I of Castile and Leon to extort tribute from al-Muẓaffar and then to capture the frontier garrisons of Viseu and Lamego (1057). Ferdinand also took Coimbra and the surrounding area as far north as the Douro River (1063), in present Portugal. ʿUmar al-Mutawakkil (reigned 1068–94) was also forced to pay tribute to Alfonso VI of Castile and Leon; and he made an unsuccessful attempt to annex Toledo, which was held by a rival Muslim dynasty (1080). When Toledo was eventually taken by Alfonso in 1085, al-Mutawakkil and several other Muslim kings appealed to the Almoravids of North Africa for assistance. Almoravid armies defeated Alfonso at al-Zallāqah near Badajoz (October 23, 1086), establishing a foothold in Spain. Hence, al-Mutawakkil tried to bargain for Alfonso VI’s support, but Badajoz fell to the Almoravids in 1094, and al-Mutawakkil and two of his sons were executed.
