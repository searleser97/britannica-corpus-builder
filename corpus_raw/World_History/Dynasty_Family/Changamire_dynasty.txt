Changamire Dynasty,   dynasty that ruled a vast area in central Africa between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers (now in Zimbabwe). The dynasty was the greatest power in central Africa from the 15th century until its destruction about 1830; it succeeded even in driving the Portuguese out of the interior of Africa.
Its founder, Changamir, was a lowly son of Matope, the ruler of the Mbire (or Monomotapa) empire, who appointed him governor of its central and southern provinces. He declared his independence of Matope’s successor and founded a kingdom that he called Rozwi. He established trade contacts with Arab traders, and his son (Changamire II, who used the name as a dynastic title) established contacts with the Portuguese settlements on the east African coast (c. 1500).
Although contacts with the Portuguese were initially encouraged, from 1693 to 1695 the Changamire empire drove the Portuguese from all their stations in the interior during a campaign against the remainder of the Mbire empire. Changamire’s empire was destroyed by the coming of the Ngoni and Ndebele tribes during the Mfecane (a period of vast migrations occasioned by Zulu wars in South Africa).
