Demidov Family,   Russian family that acquired great wealth in the 18th century, largely through iron production and mining, and became patrons of the arts and sciences.
Nikita Demidovich Antufyev (1656–1725) was a blacksmith from the western Russian city of Tula, who took the surname Demidov in 1702. He began to accumulate his family’s fortune by manufacturing weapons and, after receiving land grants from Peter I the Great (reigned 1682–1725), by building and operating an iron foundry at Tula. Peter made Demidov, a former serf, a nobleman.
Akinfy Demidov (1678–1745), Nikita’s son, increased his inherited wealth by expanding his holdings and establishing gold, silver, and copper mines, mainly in the Ural Mountains. Largely as a result of Nikita’s and Akinfy’s efforts, the Demidov family, by the end of the 18th century, controlled vast estates and enterprises and produced about 40 percent of the country’s output of cast iron.
Subsequently, other members of the family engaged in philanthropic activities. Akinfy’s nephew Pavel Grigoryevich Demidov (1738–1821) traveled extensively and became a benefactor of Russian education. His nephew Count Nikolay Nikitich Demidov (1773–1828) directed the family’s mining business and also contributed liberally to scientific education, mainly in Moscow. Nikolay’s elder son, Pavel Nikolayevich Demidov (1798–1840), founded an annual prize for Russian literature, to be awarded by the Academy of Sciences. Nikolay’s younger son, Anatoly Nikolayevich Demidov (1812–70), also a traveler and patron of the arts, lived for many years in Italy, purchased the Tuscan title prince of San Donato, and married (1840) Princess Mathilde, Jérôme Bonaparte’s daughter and Napoleon I’s niece.
