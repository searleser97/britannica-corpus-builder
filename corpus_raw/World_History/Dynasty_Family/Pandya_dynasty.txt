Pandya dynasty,  Tamil rulers in the extreme south of India of unknown antiquity (they are mentioned by Greek authors in the 4th century bce). The Roman emperor Julian received an embassy from a Pandya about 361 ce. The dynasty revived under Kadungon in the early 7th century ce and ruled from Madura (now Madurai) or farther south until the 16th century. The small but important (9th–13th century) dynasty of Pandya of Ucchangi, a hill fort south of the Tungabhadra River, may have originated from the Madura family.
The Pandya kings were called either Jatavarman or Maravarman. From being Jains they became Shaivas (worshipers of the Hindu deity Shiva) and are celebrated in the earliest Tamil poetry. They ruled extensive territories, at times including the Chera (Kerala) country, the Chola country, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) through collateral branches subject to Madura. The “Five Pandyas” flourished from the 12th to the 14th century and eventually assumed control of all the plains of the extreme south as far north as Nellore (1257). Family quarrels, however, and Muslim invasions, from 1311, culminating in the foundation of the Madura sultanate, weakened Pandya influence. By 1312 control over Kerala was lost, and by the mid-16th century all their territories had passed into other hands.
