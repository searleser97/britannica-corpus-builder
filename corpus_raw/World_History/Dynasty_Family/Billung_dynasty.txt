Billung dynasty,  the primary ruling dynasty in Saxony in the 10th and 11th centuries. It was founded by Hermann Billung, who in 936 received from the German king (and future emperor) Otto I a march, or border territory, on the lower Elbe River to be held against the pagan Slavic Wends. Otto repeatedly granted Hermann extensive authority in his absences (notably in Italy) but avoided attributing the ducal title to him. Herman’s son, Bernhard I (d. 1101), developed his father’s ducal status and title in Saxony and thereafter passed it to his descendants, who continued the struggle against the Slavs.
Although the family extended its conquests toward the Oder River, thus preparing these territories for Christianization, their lands consisted of only the northeastern part of the former stem duchy of Saxony. Bernard I obtained guarantees of the special privileges and customs of the Saxons from the emperor Henry II; Bernard II (d. 1059) obtained similar guarantees from the emperor Conrad II. Both Bernard II and his son Ordulf (d. 1072) had to defend their territories against the encroachments of Adalbert, archbishop of Bremen. The family came to embody the Saxon national resentment toward the Salian kings and emperors Henry III and particularly Henry IV, who wanted to reestablish imperial authority in Saxony. In August 1106, with the death of Magnus Billung, the family died out.
