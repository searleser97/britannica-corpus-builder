Frédéric Le Play, in full Pierre-Guillaume-Frédéric Le Play,  (born April 11, 1806, La Rivière-Saint-Sauveur, France—died  April 5, 1882, Paris), French mining engineer and sociologist who developed techniques for systematic research on the family.
Le Play was engineer in chief and a professor of metallurgy at the École des Mines from 1840 and the inspector of the school from 1848. He devoted his spare time to sociological research until about 1855, when, dismayed by the conditions of industrial labourers and by the recurring revolutions in France, he gave up mining in favour of sociology. He served as a senator from 1867, but, after his country’s defeat in the Franco-German War of 1870–71, he also abandoned politics.
As a sociologist, Le Play opposed the then-fashionable notion of society’s continuous evolutionary progress. He viewed the family as the chief agent of social stability and moral authority in the face of industrialization and its accompanying social conflicts, and he propounded a theory of cyclic changes in society that were related to rises or declines in family morale. In the course of gathering data for his theories, Le Play developed what is now known as the case-study method, in which a field-worker lives with a family for a period of time, gathering data on the family members’ attitudes and interactions and on their income, expenditures, and physical possessions. The development of statistical sampling, fundamental to social survey methodology, was influenced by Le Play’s method of collating data that he obtained through field research.
Le Play published his findings on family and society in the six-volume study Les Ouvriers européens (1855; “European Workers”), in La Réforme sociale en France, 2 vol. (1864; “Social Reform in France”), and in L’Organisation du travail (1870; “The Organization of Labor”).
