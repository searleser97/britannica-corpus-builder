Godefroy Family,   distinguished French family of legal scholars and historians. Denis I Godefroy, called Denis the Old (1549–1621), was a Protestant who for that reason lived in exile in Switzerland and Germany. His Corpus juris civilis (1583) had a long life, going through 20 editions. His son Théodore (1580–1649) abjured Protestantism and lived in France, where he wrote historical works. Jacques Godefroy (1587–1652), also a son of Denis I, was a professor at the University of Geneva. His edition of the Codex Theodosianus, published posthumously, was his most important work. Denis II Godefroy, called Denis the Young (1615–81), son of Théodore, was also a historian and archivist. Denis III (1653–1719), son of Denis II, was keeper of the books at the Chambre des Comptes, the central financial administration, in Paris. Jean Godefroy, sieur d’Aumont (1656–1732), also a son of Denis II, was editor of a number of historical documents.
