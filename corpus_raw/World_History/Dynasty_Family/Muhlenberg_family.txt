Muhlenberg Family,   distinguished U.S. family long associated with the state of Pennsylvania and the Lutheran Church, whose members included prominent figures in education, the military, and government.
Henry Melchior Mühlenberg (b. Sept. 6, 1711, Einbeck, Hanover—d. Oct. 7, 1787, Trappe, Pa., U.S.), the founder of the family, studied theology at Göttingen and Halle. In 1742, in reply to a call from the Lutheran churches of Pennsylvania, he went to America. Although occupied particularly with the congregation at New Providence (later Trappe), Pa., he functioned as overseer of all Lutheran churches from New York to Maryland. In 1748 he organized the first Lutheran synod in America.
John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg (1746–1807), eldest child of Henry Melchior, was a Lutheran minister and a brigadier general in the Continental (American revolutionary) Army. He commanded the infantry at the battle of Yorktown. A congressman for several terms, he was also a friend of Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe.
Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg (1750–1801), second son of Henry Melchior, a Lutheran minister, served as a member of the Continental Congress and first speaker of the national House of Representatives. His brother Gotthilf Henry Ernest Muhlenberg was, in addition to being a Lutheran minister, a botanist of some note. He was the first president (1787) of Franklin College, Lancaster, Pa.
William Augustus Muhlenberg (1796–1877), a grandson of Frederick Augustus Conrad, was an Episcopal priest, ecumenical theologian, and hymnologist. He founded St. Paul’s College, Flushing, Long Island (1838); St. Luke’s Hospital, New York City (1858); and, to realize his understanding of Christianity as expressed by social service, the first U.S. order of Episcopal deaconesses (1852).
Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg (1818–1901), grandson of Gotthilf Henry Ernest, a Lutheran clergyman and educator, was instrumental in the establishment of several Pennsylvania colleges. He was also the first president of Muhlenberg College, Allentown, Pa. (1867).
