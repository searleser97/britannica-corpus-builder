Nahyan dynasty, Arabic Āl Nahyān (“Nahyān family”),  ruling family of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, a constituent part of the United Arab Emirates. The family was originally Bedouin of the Banū Yās confederation of Arabia from around the oases of Līwā in the Rubʿ al-Khali desert; in the 1790s it transferred its centre from Līwā to Abu Dhabi. The Nahyan family has long played a leading role in the political life of the emirate, and its rapport with other sheikhdoms grew significantly under the leadership of Zayed ibn Khalifa (1855–1909). After oil was discovered in Abu Dhabi in 1958, the family has overseen the bulk of the economic activity among the emirates, despite some reluctance on the part of Shakhbout ibn Sultan (1928–66). In the 1960s members of the Nahyan dynasty and the  Maktoum dynasty of Dubai cooperated to lay the groundwork for self-rule in what would become the United Arab Emirates. Beginning with Sheikh Zayed ibn Sultan (1971–2004) and followed by his son Sheikh Khalifa ibn Zayed (2004– ), the head of the Nahyan family has served as the country’s president since its foundation.
