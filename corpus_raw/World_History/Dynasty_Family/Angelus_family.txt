Angelus family, Angelus also spelled Angelos,  family that produced three Byzantine emperorsâ€”Isaac II, Alexius III, and Alexius IV Angelus. The Angelus family was of no particular significance until the 12th century, when Theodora, youngest daughter of the emperor Alexius I Comnenus, married Constantine Angelus of Philadelphia (in Anatolia). Numerous members of the family then held high positions under Manuel I Comnenus and were involved in an aristocratic revolution that in 1185 overthrew Andronicus I Comnenus and placed Isaac II Angelus on the throne. Isaac and his brother Alexius III, who deposed and blinded Isaac in 1195, were among the least competent of all Byzantine rulers. The struggle between these two brothers eventually lured the Fourth Crusade to Constantinople (now Istanbul), ultimately causing the destruction of the empire in 1204.
The despots of Epirus and Thessaly, who saved much of northern Greece from Western conquest after 1204 and whose dynasty survived until 1318, were direct descendants of Constantine Angelus and Theodora. One of the last prominent members of the family was John Angelus, who was appointed governor of Thessaly in 1342.
