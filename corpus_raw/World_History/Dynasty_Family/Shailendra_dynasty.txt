Shailendra dynasty, also spelled Sailendra, or Çailendra, Indonesian Śailendra, or Sjailendra (“Lord of the Mountain”),  a dynasty that flourished in Java from about 750 to 850 after the fall of the Funan kingdom of mainland Southeast Asia. The dynasty was marked by a great cultural renaissance associated with the introduction of Mahāyāna Buddhism, and it attained a high level of artistic expression in the many temples and monuments built under its rule. During the reign of one of its kings, the famous stupa of Borobuḍur (q.v.) was built.
Except for its legacy of monuments, little is known of the dynasty. It apparently emanated from the agricultural lowlands of interior Java but extended its real power to the northwestern coasts of the island, from which its emissaries traded with and raided the Malay peninsula and Indochina. There is a Khmer tradition of Shailendra overlordship in the latter part of the 8th century. The Shailendra dynasty was driven to Sumatra (Palembang) in the mid-9th century.
