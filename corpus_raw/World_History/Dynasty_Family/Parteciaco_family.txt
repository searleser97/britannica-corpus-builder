Parteciaco family, also spelled Partecipazio,  noted Venetian family that produced seven doges between 810 and 942, as well as many bishops and church officials.
The first dux, or doge, in the family was one Ursus (or Orso I Parteciaco), who ruled from 727 to 739; but the real founder of the dynasty was Agnello Parteciaco (died 827). Opposing a faction that had placed Venice under the control of Charlemagne’s son Pippin, the Frankish king of Italy, Agnello moved the government from the island of Malamocco (now Lido) to its present site on the Rialto group of islands, where political independence could be more easily maintained. He undertook the building of many bridges connecting the islands and began the construction of the first Doges’ Palace. A merchant as well as a statesman, he obtained important commercial privileges from the Byzantine emperors Leo V the Armenian and Michael II.
Agnello was succeeded by his sons Giustiniano and Giovanni I. Giustiniano is known to economic historians because of his will, which contained large bequests of pepper and other spices, demonstrating that Venice was already engaged in large-scale trade with the Levant in the early 9th century. In 828, during Giustiniano’s reign, the remains of St. Mark were smuggled out of Alexandria, Egypt, and the building of a basilica was begun on the site of the present St. Mark’s to house the relics. During the rule of Orso II (864–881), many reforms were accomplished, including a reorganization of the national church.
