Karadjordjević dynasty, Serbo-Croatian Karađorđević,  rulers descended from the Serbian rebel leader Karadjordje (Karageorge, or Karađorđe). It rivaled the Obrenović dynasty for control of Serbia during the 19th century and ruled that country as well as its successor state, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (called Yugoslavia after 1929), in 1842–58 and 1903–45.
The first prince, Alexander (son of Karadjordje), reigned from 1842 to 1858. Thereafter, for nearly half a century, the Obrenović dynasty was in power. Finally, in 1903, Alexander’s son Peter I became king; he reigned as king of Serbia from 1903 to 1918 and then as king of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes until his death in 1921. He was followed by his son, Alexander I (reigned 1921–34), who in 1929 changed the name of the state to Yugoslavia; Alexander’s son and successor, Peter II, reigned from 1934 to 1945, when the monarchy was abolished.
Peter II’s son Alexander was raised in Britain, where he made a career in banking. Following the disintegration of Yugoslavia in 1992, the revival of royalist sentiment in Serbia led to his reluctant emergence as a focus of democratic opposition to the regime of Slobodan Milošević. In 2001 Alexander, styling himself as crown prince (the title he bore at the time of the monarchy’s demise), returned to Serbia, where he successfully recovered much of the land and personal property that was once his family’s.
