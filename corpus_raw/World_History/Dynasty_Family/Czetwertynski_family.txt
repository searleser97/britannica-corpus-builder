Czetwertyński family, also called Świetopełk-Czetwertyński,  Polish princely family descended from the Kievan grand prince Svyatopolk II Izyaslavich (d. 1113) of the house of Rurik. Among its prominent members was Antoni Czetwertyński (1748–94), the castellan of Przemyśl and last leader of the pro-Russian Confederation of Targowica that opposed the Polish constitution of 1791; he was finally hanged as a traitor to Poland during Tadeusz Kościuszko’s insurrection. Other family members included the philanthropist Włodzimierz (1837–1918) and his son Seweryn Franciszek Kalikst (1873–1945), who was a delegate to the Russian Duma (lower house of the imperial legislature) of 1906 and the Polish Sejm (parliament) from 1922 to 1928.
