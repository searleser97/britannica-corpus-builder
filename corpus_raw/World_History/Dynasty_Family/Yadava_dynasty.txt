Yadava dynasty,  rulers of a 12th–14th-century Hindu kingdom of central India in what is now the Indian state of Maharashtra. Originally a feudatory of the Eastern Chalukyas of Kalyani, the dynasty became paramount in the Deccan under Bhillama (c. 1187–91), who founded Devagiri (later Daulatabad) as his capital. Under Bhillama’s grandson Singhana (reigned c. 1210–47) the dynasty reached its height, as the Yadava campaigned against the Hoysalas in the south, the Kakatiyas in the east, and the Paramaras and Chalukyas in the north.
Later rulers continued expansionist wars with varying success. During the reign of the last Yadava king, Ramachandra (reigned 1271–c. 1309), a Muslim army commanded by the Delhi sultan ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Khaljī invaded the kingdom in 1294 and imposed tributary status. A later attempt to throw off the vassalage brought another Delhi army; Ramachandra was imprisoned but was later released and remained loyal to Delhi until his death. In a further attempt, his son and successor died in battle, and the kingdom was annexed by the Khaljī empire in 1317.
