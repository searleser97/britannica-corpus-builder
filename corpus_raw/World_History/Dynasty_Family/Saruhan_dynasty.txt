Saruhan Dynasty,   Turkmen dynasty (c. 1300–1410) that ruled in the Manisa region of western Anatolia.
The dynasty was founded by Saruhan, a tribal chief and frontier prince in the service of the Seljuqs of Anatolia who traced his descent to the Khwārezm-Shāhs of Central Asia; after its conquest of Manisa (1313), the dynasty’s principality extended its territories to the Aegean Sea. Surrounded by the Turkmen principalities of Aydın, Germiyan, and Karası, Saruhan became a seafaring state with a large fleet. It was active in the Mediterranean trade and supplied leadership, together with Aydın, to the gazis (warriors for the Islāmic faith) in their incursions into Byzantine coastal territories. The loss of Izmir (1344) to Western crusaders by the Aydın principality and the rise of the Ottomans as the dominant power on the Byzantine frontier closed the channels of trade and coastal raids for Saruhan. In 1390 it was annexed by the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I; but its independence was restored by the Central Asian ruler Timur (Tamerlane) in 1402. Finally, c. 1410, the last Saruhan ruler, Hızır, was killed by the Ottoman prince Mehmed Çelebi (later Sultan Mehmed I), and Saruhan was reincorporated into the Ottoman Empire.
