Dānishmend dynasty, also spelled Danişmend, also called Dānishmendid,  Turkmen dynasty that ruled in the Sivas-Kayseri-Malatya-Kastamonu region of central and northeastern Anatolia from about 1071 to 1178.
Dānishmend (Danişmend), founder of the dynasty, first appeared in Anatolia as a gazi (warrior for the faith of Islām) during a period of confusion that followed the death of the Seljuq sultan Sulaymān ibn Qutalmïsh in 1086. In 1102 Dānishmend took Malatya, but when he died in 1104, the city was captured by the Seljuq sultan Qïlïj Arslan.
Dānishmend’s son and successor, Gazi, intervened in dynastic struggles among the sons of Qïlïj Arslan and helped Masʿūd seize power in 1116. Gazi then captured Malatya, Ankara, Kayseri, and Kastamonu from Masʿūd’s rivals (1127). Finally in 1133 Gazi recaptured Kastamonu from the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus, who had taken it the previous year. The caliph al-Mustarshid and Sanjar, the Seljuq sultan of Iraq-Iran, rewarded Gazi for his victories over the Christians by granting him the title of malik (king). Gazi died, however, in 1134, and his son Mehmed (Muḥammad) took the title instead.
When Mehmed died (1142), the Dānishmend territory was divided among his two brothers—Yağibasan (Yaghibasan) in Sivas and ʿAyn ad-Dawlah in Malatya-Elbistan—and his son Dhū an-Nūn in Kayseri. After Yağibasan’s death (1164), the Seljuq sultan Qïlïj Arslan II intervened repeatedly in the affairs of the Sivas and Kayseri branches and finally invaded Dānishmend territory; but he was stopped by Dhū an-Nūn’s father-in-law, Nureddin of Mosul. Nureddin died in 1174, however, and Qïlïj was able to take Sivas, the Yeşil Irmak (Iris) valley, Tokat, and Amasya (1175), and Dhū an-Nūn was slain. The Malatya branch came under Seljuq control in 1178, thus marking the end of the Dānishmend dynasty.
Dānishmend, the first ruler, is the hero of an oral epic tradition, the Dānishmendnāme, which first appeared in written form about 1245.
