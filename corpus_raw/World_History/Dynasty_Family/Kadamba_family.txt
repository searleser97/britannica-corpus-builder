Kadamba family,  minor dynastic power that held sway in an area to the northwest of Mysore city on the Indian subcontinent between the 4th and 6th centuries ce. Their chroniclers claim that the family migrated from northern India, but other records suggest that they were indigenous to Kuntala (northern Kanara). An early inscription, the accuracy of which is unknown, describes the dynastic founder, Mayurasharman, as a learned Brahman who, after being insulted by a Pallava official, took up a military career and acquired sufficient territory to bargain with the Pallavas for a feudal principality on the western coast. His son Kangavarman, who assumed the title Dharmamaharajadhiraja (“Lawful King of Kings”), was probably the king of Kuntala defeated by the Vakateka king Vindhyaseva. His grandson Kakusthavarman (reigned c. 425–450) was a powerful ruler involved in many marriage alliances with the Guptas and other kingly families. After his death the southern part of the kingdom was established as an independent principality under his younger son, Krishnavarman. A period of warfare between the two branches of the family followed, during which the junior branch initially triumphed but was quickly forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of first the Pallavas and then the senior branch. The Kadamba kingdom came to an end with Pulakeshin II’s capture of Banavasi during the reign of Ajavarman.
