Nemanjić Dynasty, , Nemanjić also spelled Nemanja,  ruling Serbian family that from the late 12th to the mid-14th century developed the principality of Raška into a large empire.
The dynasty traced its descent from Stefan Nemanja, who, as veliki župan, or grand chieftain, of the Serb region of Raška from 1169 to 1196, began to expand his domain while remaining a vassal of the Byzantine emperor. His son, Stefan Prvovenčani (the “First-Crowned”), was granted the title of king of Raška by Pope Honorius III in 1217. His younger brother, Rastko (later canonized as St. Sava), became in 1219 the first archbishop of an independent Serbian Orthodox church. This close alliance between secular and sacred power gave the Nemanjić state much of its strength and stability.
The succeeding Nemanjić kings were Stefan’s sons Stefan Radoslav, Stefan Vladislav, and Stefan Uroš I, who was succeeded by his sons Stefan Dragutin and Stefan Uroš II (also called Stefan Milutin; reigned 1282–1321). Stefan Uroš II took substantial territory in Macedonia from Byzantium. His son, Stefan Uroš III (reigned 1322–31), expanded the state eastward into Bulgaria before being dethroned by his own son, Stefan Dušan (reigned 1331–55). In a series of wars against the Byzantines, Stefan Dušan, the greatest of the Nemanjić kings, conquered all of Albania, Macedonia, and Montenegro and drove farther south to take Epirus, Aetolia, and Thessaly (in Greece). He was crowned emperor in 1346. Serbs consider Dušan’s reign to be their Golden Age, during which the law code called the Zakonik was promulgated, many churches and monasteries were built, and agriculture, industry, and trade developed.
Stefan Dušan’s son and successor, Stefan Uroš V (from 1355), was a weak ruler under whom the Serbian empire dissolved into fragments ruled by rival princes. The Serbian principalities were compelled to accept the suzerainty of the Byzantine emperor before falling to the advancing power of the Ottoman Turks after 1371.
