Zagwe dynasty, also spelled Zague,  line of 12th- and 13th-century Ethiopian kings who combined a nomadic military life with an impassioned desire to build monuments to their Christian religion. Their tenuous pretensions to succession, based on a legendary marriage to a daughter of one of the last Aksumite kings, the line they deposed, was subsequently confirmed by the church; in return for its support, liberal royal endowments were granted.
Descended mainly from the Agau (Agaw, or Agew) people, the house of Zagwe originated in the district of Bugna, and its kings moved the administrative capital to Roha (now named Lalibela), in the safety of their native Lasta Mountains. The Zagwe kings ruled much of what is now northern and central Ethiopia, but any pretensions they may have had to control the hilly country east of the Shewa Plateau lapsed as the region was increasingly occupied by such Muslim states as Ifat and Hadya.
Lalibela, the best-known Zagwe emperor, ruled at the beginning of the 13th century and is known for building the monolithic rock-hewn churches at the Zagwe capital, which was later renamed for him. Zagwe rule was destined to be short-lived, for at the end of the 13th century Yekuno Amlak, a prince of the Amhara, incited so successful a rebellion in Shewa that the Zagwe king, Yitbarek, was driven out and murdered. A new Zagwe king stirred up a counterrebellion but was defeated.
Later legends, modifying the circumstances of the Zagwes’ overthrow, attribute much importance to Yasus Moa, a monk who founded a community in the region of Lake Haik and who, the legends maintain, greatly influenced Yekuno Amlak in his bid for the throne. The usurpation of the throne and the murder of the king are obscured still further by later legends, which tell how another monk, Tekle Haimanot, persuaded the king of Lasta to abdicate in Yekuno Amlak’s favour.
