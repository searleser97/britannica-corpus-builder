Jalīlī Family,   prominent Iraqi family that ruled the Ottoman pașalik (province) of Mosul (in modern Iraq) in the period 1726–1834. Although the founder of the Jalīlī line, ʿAbd al-Jalīl, was a Christian slave, his son Ismāʿīl distinguished himself as a Muslim public official and became wālī (governor) of Mosul in 1726. Ḥajj Ḥusayn Pasha, who succeeded his father in 1730, became the central figure of the dynasty by successfully repulsing a siege of the city by the Iranian conqueror Nāder Shāh in 1743. Assorted members of the Jalīlī family held the office of wālī of Mosul as well as administrative positions in other Ottoman provinces until 1834, when the Ottoman Empire was reorganized under a centralized, modern form of government.
