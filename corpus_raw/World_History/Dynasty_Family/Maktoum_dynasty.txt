Maktoum dynasty, Arabic  Āl Maktūm (“Maktūm family”),  ruling family of the emirate of Dubai of the United Arab Emirates. Part of the Āl Bū Falāsah, a constituent tribe of the Banū Yās confederation, the family was one of many to leave Abu Dhabi in 1833 to escape feuding within its ruling Nahyan family. The emigrants settled in Bur Dubai, a small fishing village at the edge of Banū Yās influence. One of the leaders of the exodus, Sheikh Maktoum ibn Butti (Maktūm ibn Baṭī), became the sole ruler of Dubai in 1836. Since that time, the family has played a central role in the leadership of the emirate. The emirate remained insignificant for several decades until the trade-friendly policies of Sheikh Maktoum ibn Hashar (1894–1906) initiated the transformation of Dubai into a commercial centre. In the 1960s members of the Maktoum and the Nahyan cooperated to lay the groundwork for self-rule in what would become the United Arab Emirates. When the country was established in 1971, Sheikh Rashid ibn Saeed (ruler of Dubai from 1958 to 1990) became its vice president and, in 1979, its prime minister. Since Rashid, the ruler of Dubai has served as both vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates.
