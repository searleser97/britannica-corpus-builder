Corsini Family,   a Florentine princely family, whose first recorded ancestors rose to wealth as wool merchants in the 13th century. As typical members of the popolo grasso (rich merchants) that ruled Florence during the later European Middle Ages, they regularly served as priors and ambassadors of the commune.
Filippo Corsini (1334–1421) was created count palatine by the emperor Charles IV in 1371. Two Corsinis were bishops of Fiesole, Andrea (1349) and Neri (1374); and two were bishops of Florence, Piero (1363) and Amerigo (1411). Though some of the Corsini opposed the Medici, the family as a whole continued to flourish in business and politics under Medici rule, acquiring titles, lands, and offices. Thus another Filippo (1578–1636), who managed affairs in Rome, was created by Pope Urban VIII Marchese di Sismano, Casigliano, and Civitella. (His father, Bartolomeo, had earlier purchased the lordships.) Bartolomeo di Filippo (1622–85) was in turn made Marchese di Laiatico and Orciatico by Grand Duke Ferdinand II, and Marchese di Giovagallo and Tresana by the king of Spain.
Further titles followed the election of Lorenzo Corsini as Pope Clement XII in 1730; his nephew Bartolomeo (1683–1752) was made prince of Sismano and a grandee of Spain (1732). Lorenzo began the Corsiniana Library, now in the Lincei Academy at Rome. During the Napoleonic period and down to the unification of Italy, the Corsini remained active and influential in Tuscan affairs. The family continued through the 20th century.
