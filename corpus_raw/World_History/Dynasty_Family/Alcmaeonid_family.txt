Alcmaeonid Family,  a powerful Athenian family, claiming descent from the legendary Alcmaeon, that was important in 5th- and 6th-century-bc politics. During the archonship of one of its members, Megacles (632? bc), a certain Cylon failed in an attempt to make himself tyrant, and his followers were slain at an altar sanctuary. Accused of sacrilege and murder, the Alcmaeonids incurred the bloodguilt that was to be used against them in political struggles for more than two centuries. The family was banished for the murder but returned during the ascendancy of Solon (early 6th century) to lead a party in Athens, which accepted Solon’s reforms.
After Peisistratus became tyrant in 561–560, the Alcmaeonids, allied with the more conservative aristocrats, twice drove him from the city before he managed to have the family exiled. They were recalled later, and one of their members, Cleisthenes, was made archon for 525/524. Upon the murder of Peisistratus’ son Hipparchus in 514, they were exiled once more by the tyrant Hippias. In 513 Cleisthenes led the Alcmaeonids in an unsuccessful invasion of Attica from their base in Boeotia. The family was rewarded for rebuilding the fire-damaged temple of Apollo at Delphi when the Spartans, largely at the insistence of the Delphic oracle, finally drove out the Peisistratids in 510. Two years later Cleisthenes introduced a program of constitutional reforms that greatly furthered the development of Athenian democracy.
The policy followed by this opportunistic family during the next generation is obscure. They were suspected of collusion with the Persians at the Battle of Marathon (490), but the direct-line descendants were considerably less prominent after the Persian Wars. Both Alcibiades and Pericles, however, were descended from the family through their mothers. Spartan demands at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War for the expulsion of the Alcmaeonids were provocations directed at Pericles.
