Idrīsid dynasty, also called al-Idrīsiyūn,  Arab Muslim dynasty that ruled in Morocco from 789 until 921.
The founder, Idrīs I (Idrīs ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Ḥasan II), who reigned 789–791 at Walīla, was a sharif, or princely descendant of Muhammad, and was one of the few survivors of the battle of Fakhkh, in which many of the ʿAlids were slain by the ʿAbbāsids. He fled west and succeeded in conquering Berber tribes in northern Morocco and a part of the Atlantic plains. His son, Idrīs II (reigned 803–828), resumed his work without, however, succeeding in subduing the whole country. Nevertheless, in 808, Idrīs II founded as a capital for his little kingdom the town of Fez (modern Fès), which henceforth became a political and religious centre. The Idrīsids were the first to organize, outside the Berber tribal system, a central government that was partly composed of Arabs. They established the sharifian tradition in Morocco and were also responsible for making a part of northern Morocco linguistically Arabic. After the death of Idrīs II, however, the kingdom was divided up, and the power of the Idrīsids declined. They were eventually crushed between the Umayyad caliphs of Córdoba and the Fāṭimids of Cairo. The last Idrīsid ruler was killed while a prisoner of the Umayyads in 985.
