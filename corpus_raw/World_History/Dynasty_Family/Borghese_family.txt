Borghese Family,   a noble Italian family, originally from Siena, who first gained fame in the 13th century as magistrates, ambassadors, and other public officials. They moved to Rome in the 16th century and there, following the election (1605) of Camillo as Pope Paul V, rose in wealth and fame.
Among the early members, Galgano was papal ambassador to Naples (1456), Pietro was nominated senator by Leo X (pope 1513–21) in 1516, and Giambattista was a famed apologist for Clement VII (pope 1523–34).
The move to Rome was started by Marcantonio (1504–74), the father of Camillo Borghese, the future Pope Paul V. (See Paul V under Paul [Papacy].) Paul V bestowed privileges upon family members, first naming as cardinal his nephew Scipione Caffarelli (1576–1633), whom he adopted into the Borghese family.
Augmenting his wealth and influence, Scipione played a leading role in church politics. His chief interest, however, was the cultivation of the arts, to which he devoted the greater part of his life and wealth. Most importantly, he recognized and encouraged the talent of the young Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598–1680), who later became the outstanding sculptor and architect of the Italian Baroque.
With the sizable income that he enjoyed from the several ecclesiastic offices that he held, Scipione financed the restoration and construction of many churches and palaces in the city of Rome. His major project was to have the Villa Borghese built in Rome, where he assembled an important collection of paintings and sculptures.
Pope Paul V also helped his nephew Marcantonio II (1601–58), who fathered the present branch of the Borghese family, whose wealth and estates he vastly augmented. Paul V obtained for Marcantonio the important principality of Sulmona and made him prince of Vivaro. Marcantonio married Camilla Orsini (1619), thereby acquiring the estates of the powerful Orsini family. He also arranged the marriage of his son Paolo (d. 1646) to Olimpia, the Aldobrandini heiress.
Other family members who remained prominent in church affairs in Siena included Cardinals Pier Maria (c. 1600–1642), Francesco (1697–1759), and Scipione (1734–82). Somewhat later, Marcantonio III became viceroy of Naples. The Borghese tradition of patronage of the arts was carried on by his nephew Marcantonio IV (1730–1800), who had the Villa Borghese renewed. He also enlarged the Borghese estates by his marriage to the wealthy and prominent Maria Salviati.
In the 19th century, Camillo Fillipo Ludovico (1775–1832) played an important role in Franco-Italian relations. Having married Napoleon’s sister Marie Pauline (1803), he reached the rank of general in the army and was named governor of Piedmont (1807). After Napoleon’s abdication, he concluded a surrender with the victorious Austrians and later maintained order during the transfer of power. Camillo won infamy for having sold to Napoleon the magnificent Borghese family art collection, part of which he recovered in 1815.
Camillo’s brother Francesco (1776–1839) later became a general. Francesco’s grandsons split the family into two branches. One, led by Paolo (1845–1920), retained the name Borghese; the other, led by Giulio (1847–1914), took the cognomen Torlonia.
