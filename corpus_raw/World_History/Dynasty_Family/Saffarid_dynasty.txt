Saffarid dynasty,  (flourished  9th century ce), Iranian dynasty that ruled a large area in eastern Iran. The dynasty’s founder, Yaʿqūb ibn Layth al-Ṣaffār (“the coppersmith”), took control of his native province, Seistan, about 866. By 869 he had extended his control into northeastern India, adding the Kabul Valley, Sindh, Tocharistan, Makran (Balochistan), Kermān, and Fārs to his possessions; with the overthrow of the Tahirids and the annexation of Khorāsān in 873 the Saffarid empire reached its greatest extent. Yaʿqūb then ventured to march against Baghdad in 876 but was defeated by the forces of the caliph al-Muʿtamid at Dayr al-ʿĀqūl.
The caliph then acknowledged Yaʿqūb’s brother and successor (879), ʿAmr ibn Layth, as governor of Khorāsān, Isfahan, Fārs, Seistan, and Sindh. But the Saffarid empire collapsed when ʿAmr, trying to wrest Transoxania from the Samanids, was defeated by Ismāʿīl ibn Aḥmad near Balkh in 900. Thereafter few of the Saffarids had any wide authority, though they maintained their position in Seistan intermittently at least until the 16th century, despite Samanid, Ghaznavid, and Mongol conquests.
