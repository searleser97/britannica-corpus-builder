Trung Sisters, byname of Trung Trac and Trung Nhi,  (flourished ad 39–43), heroines of the first Vietnamese independence movement, who headed a rebellion against the Chinese Han-dynasty overlords and briefly established an autonomous state. Their determination and apparently strong leadership qualities are cited by scholars of Southeast Asian culture as testimony to the respected position and freedom of women in Vietnamese society, as compared with the male-dominated societies of China and India.
Trung Trac, the elder sister, was the widow of Thi Sach, lord of Chau Dien, in northern Vietnam, who had been assassinated by a Chinese general for plotting with other lords to overthrow the Chinese. Trung Trac thereupon assumed leadership of the movement. In ad 39 she, with her sister Trung Nhi and other members of the aristocracy, marched on Lien Lau, forcing the Chinese commander to flee. Within a year the sisters and their allies held 65 northern citadels. At Me Linh, in the lower Red River delta, the Trung Sisters jointly proclaimed themselves queens of an independent state (of unknown name) extending from southern China to the present site of Hue.
The Trung Sisters’ revolutionaries—without peasant support, without supplies, and with untrained forces—were no match, however, for the seasoned Chinese troops of General Ma Yüan (Ma Vien). He defeated them first at Lang Bac, near the present site of Hanoi. The Trung Sisters then retreated to Hat Mon, now Son Tay, where they were decisively beaten. Unable to face defeat, they committed suicide, drowning themselves at the juncture of the Day and Red rivers in ad 43. The Hai Ba (“Two Sisters”) pagoda at Hanoi and the pagoda of Hat Mon, in the province of Son Tay, are dedicated to the Trung Sisters, and an avenue in downtown Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) is named for them.
