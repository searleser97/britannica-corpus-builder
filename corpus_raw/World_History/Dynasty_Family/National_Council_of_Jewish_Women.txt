National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW),  oldest volunteer Jewish women’s organization in the United States, founded in 1893. Prompted by Jewish values, the organization works with both the Jewish community and the general public to safeguard rights and freedoms for people worldwide. This objective is sought through a comprehensive program of research, education, and community service, placing particular emphasis on advocacy for women and children. Some of the NCJW’s current issues of concern include women’s reproductive rights, equal pay, comparable worth, domestic violence, and sexual harassment. The organization has headquarters in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Jerusalem.
The NCJW was founded by Hannah Greenebaum Solomon in 1893 during the Parliament of Religions at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. During the early years of its existence, the organization concentrated its efforts on assisting recent immigrants—for example, arranging help for unescorted immigrant women arriving in the United States. The organization also worked in conjunction with Hull House. Following World War II, the organization set up a number of programs to aid those whose lives had been ravaged by the war. Since the 1960s the NCJW has concentrated on educational and social services for children. The organization funds two foundations, the Research Institute for Innovation in Education at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, which is mainly concerned with the education of young people in Israel, and the Center for the Child in New York City, an institute dedicated to researching issues that affect children.
