Bārakzay dynasty,  ruling family in Afghanistan in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Bārakzay brothers seized control of Afghanistan and in 1826 divided the region between them. Dōst Moḥammad Khan gained preeminence and founded the dynasty about 1837. Thereafter his descendants ruled in direct succession until 1929, when the reigning monarch abdicated and his cousin Moḥammad Nāder Khan was elected king.
Nāder Khan, on his assassination in 1933, was succeeded by his son Zahir Shah, who reigned until July 17, 1973, when he was deposed and a republic was proclaimed. The Bārakzay rulers, in chronological order, were Dōst Moḥammad Khan, Shīr ʿAlī Khan, Yaʿqūb Khan, ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Khan, Ḥabībullāh Khan, ʿAmānullāh Khan, Moḥammad Nāder Khan, and Mohammad Zahir Shah.
