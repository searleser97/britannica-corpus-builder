Uesugi Family,   one of the most important warrior clans in Japan from early in the 15th century until the last half of the 19th.
The Uesugi were already dominant in the Kantō region of Honshu when the appointment of the head of the family to the hereditary post of governor-general of Kantō in 1439 made them the second most powerful clan in Japan and the dominant power in the western part of the country.
By the middle of the 16th century, however, the family had been replaced in the Kantō region by the newly ascendant feudal power of the Hōjō family. With the aid of Uesugi Kenshin (1530–78), a warrior who had been adopted into the family, the clan was able to recoup some of its losses, and by the late 16th century it was relocated in the northern tip of the north Honshu plain in central Japan.
Uesugi Kagekatsu (1555–1623), who succeeded Kenshin as head of the clan, became one of the early allies in the campaign of Toyotomi Hideyoshi to reunify Japan. Before Hideyoshi died, he appointed Kagekatsu to serve as one of the five regents for his infant son Hideyori.
In 1600 Kagekatsu attempted to challenge the power of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the head of the regency council. Kagekatsu’s defeat marked the ascendancy of the Tokugawa family as the preeminent power in Japan. But Ieyasu, who in 1603 had himself appointed shogun, or hereditary military dictator of Japan, permitted the Uesugi family to retain part of its former domain. Under the Tokugawa system, the Uesugi became the daimyos, or lords, of Yonezawa in northern Honshu. The Uesugi continued to rule that territory until the Meiji Restoration (1868), when the Tokugawa house was overthrown and the feudal structure of Japan abolished. Under the new government Yonezawa was incorporated into the newly created Yamagata prefecture.
