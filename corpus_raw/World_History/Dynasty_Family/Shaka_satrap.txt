Shaka satrap, also called Kshatrapa,  either of two dynasties of satraps in northwestern India who ruled with considerable independence on behalf of the Pahlava suzerains. The two families are both known to Indian literature as the Shakas (from the native word for Scythians) and to most Western historians as the Kshatrapas.
The shorter-lived of the two families bears the name Kshaharata and is known for two rulers, Bhumaka and Nahapana, whose reigns are established by coinage and by a few surviving inscriptions that appear to fix the year 124 ce as a date in Nahapana’s reign. These documents claim that Nahapana ruled over a large area in western India around the Gulf of Khambhat (Cambay), which he could only have won from the Andhras. This possession was brief, however, because the Andhra king Gautamiputra is known to have destroyed the Shakas in the latter part of the Shaka year 46 (124–125 ce).
The second dynasty of satraps, founded by Chastana in 78 ce, ruled for two or three centuries in western India and gave its name to the Shakanripakala, or era of Shaka kings, in Indian history. The rulers of this house can be dated with incomplete accuracy from their coinage. Chastana is mentioned by Ptolemy, the ancient Egyptian astronomer and geographer of Greek descent, as ruling into the 2nd century (probably 78–110 ce) and also considerably aggrandized his holdings at the expense of the Andhras. The wars of these Shakas with the Andhras continued for several regnal generations. The first great Shaka ruler was Rudradaman I, Chastana’s grandson, who reigned after 130 ce. The direct line of Chastana became extinct in 304–305 ce with the death of Vishvasena, son of Bhartridaman. It is doubtful that the dynasty was important in the 4th century, although one of its members—probably Rudrasimha III—is recorded as the “Shaka king” killed by Chandra Gupta II when he sacked the Shaka capital in 388 ce.
