Patrick family,  Canadian family who as managers, owners, and league officials helped establish professional ice hockey in Canada. Lester B. Patrick (b. December 30, 1883, Drummondville, Quebec, Canada—d. June 1, 1960, Victoria, British Columbia) and his brother Frank A. Patrick (b. December 23, 1885, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada—d. June 29, 1960, Vancouver, British Columbia) were especially noted for aiding the expansion of the National Hockey League (NHL) to the United States.
The brothers played hockey while attending McGill University (Montreal), Lester with the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association team (1901–02) and the amateur Montreal Wanderers (1905–07), both of which won Stanley Cups, and for the Brandon (Manitoba) team that played for but did not win the Stanley Cup (1903–05). Frank refereed in the Montreal senior league (1903–04), and the two joined the Renfrew Millionaires in the professional league that came to be the National Hockey Association (NHA; formed 1910).
In 1911 the Patrick family moved west to Victoria, where the brothers with their father, Joseph Frank Patrick, a lumberman, formed the Pacific Coast League. They built the first enclosed ice rinks at Vancouver and Victoria; at the time, the Vancouver rink was one of the largest buildings in Canada, seating 10,000. In that league the Patricks introduced many practices that later became standard: allowing the goalie to leave his feet; instituting blue lines in the mid-rink area, thus affecting the offside rule; adding assists to goals scored; and numbering uniform jerseys. Lester introduced the defenseman’s practice of bringing the puck up the ice, not merely passing it up, thus changing the offense.
The Pacific League suffered in attendance during World War I, and in 1926 the Patricks sold their six teams and players to the National Hockey League, which used the pool of players to establish new teams and expand the game in the United States.
Lester assembled the New York Rangers and was their manager (1927–46); the team won Stanley Cups in 1928, 1930, and 1940. He developed the first farm team system in ice hockey and was responsible for many rule changes. In 1966 the Rangers instituted the Lester Patrick Trophy to be awarded for outstanding service to ice hockey in the United States.
Frank was manager and director of the NHL (1933–34) and coached for the Boston Bruins and the Montreal Canadiens before he retired in 1941.
