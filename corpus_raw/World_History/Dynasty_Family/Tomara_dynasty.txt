Tomara dynasty,  one of the minor early medieval ruling houses of northern India. The family is known from scattered sources, and it is impossible to reconstruct its history in any detail. Puranic evidence (writings of the Puranas) gives its early location in the Himalayan region. According to bardic tradition, the dynasty was one of the 36 Rajput tribes. The history of the family spans the period between the reign of Anangapala, who founded the city of Delhi in the 11th century ce, and the incorporation of Delhi within the Chauhan (Chahamana) kingdom in 1164. Although Delhi subsequently became decisively a part of the Chauhan kingdom, numismatic and comparatively late literary evidence indicates that Tomara kings such as Anangapala and Madanapala continued to rule as feudatories, presumably until the final conquest of Delhi by the Muslims in 1192â€“93.
