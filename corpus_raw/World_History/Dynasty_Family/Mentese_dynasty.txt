Menteşe Dynasty,   Turkmen dynasty (c. 1290–1425) that ruled in the Muğla-Milas region of southwestern Anatolia.
Founded by Menteşe, the dynasty’s principality extended along the Aegean and the Mediterranean coasts, and its fleet engaged in trade and piracy. After repulsing a Byzantine attack in 1296, Menteşe’s son Mesud occupied part of the island of Rhodes in 1300. Menteşe Ibrahim was compelled in 1355 to allow the Venetians to establish a trading colony at Balat (Miletus).
Divided in about 1360 into two major branches, with their respective centres at Balat and Beçin (Peçin), the principality came under Ottoman rule in 1390–91. Its independence was restored by the Central Asian ruler Timur (Tamerlane) in 1402, but it was permanently annexed by the Ottomans in 1425.
