Ḥamdānid Dynasty,   Muslim Arab dynasty of northern Iraq (Al-Jazīrah) and Syria (905–1004) whose members were renowned as brilliant warriors and as great patrons of Arabic poets and scholars.
Ḥamdān ibn Ḥamdūn brought the family, already well established in Al-Jazīrah, to political prominence by taking part in uprisings against the ʿAbbāsid caliph late in the 9th century. His sons, however, became ʿAbbāsid officials, al-Ḥusayn serving as a military commander and Abū al-Hayjāʾ ʿAbd Allāh initiating the Ḥamdānid dynasty by assuming the post of governor of Mosul (905–929). The dynasty struck an independent course under ʿAbd Allāh’s son Nāṣir ad-Dawlah al-Ḥasan (reigned 929–969) and expanded westward into Syria. In 979 the Ḥamdānids were driven out of Mosul by the Būyid ʿAḍud ad-Dawlah, who was then annexing Iraq to his domains, and Abū Taghlib (reigned 969–979) was forced to seek refuge and help from the Fāṭimids of Egypt, though without success. ʿAḍud ad-Dawlah later maintained two Ḥamdānids, Ibrāhīm and al-Ḥusayn, as joint rulers of Mosul (981–991), but the dynasty’s power had already shifted to Syria.
Aleppo and Homs had been won about 945 by Abū Taghlib’s uncle, Sayf ad-Dawlah, who spent most of his reign (c. 943–967) defending his frontiers (from northern Syria to Armenia) against the Byzantine Greeks. It was in Sayf ad-Dawlah’s honour that the poet al-Mutanabbī (d. 965), during his stay at the Ḥamdānid court (948–957), wrote his famed panegyrics. Trouble with the Byzantine Empire increased during Saʿd ad-Dawlah’s tenure (967–971). The kingdom was invaded on several occasions, and even Aleppo and Homs were temporarily lost, while the Fāṭimids also began to infringe on the southern end of Syria. The Fāṭimids and the Ḥamdānids struggled for possession of Aleppo throughout Saʿīd ad-Dawlah’s reign (991–1002), even drawing the Byzantine emperor Basil II into the conflict. In 1002 control of Aleppo passed into the hands of the slave general Luʾluʾ, who ruled as regent (1002–04) for the last two Ḥamdānids, ʿAlī II and Sharīf II, and then as a Fāṭimid vassal.
