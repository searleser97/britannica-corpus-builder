Saud dynasty, Arabic Āl Saʿūd (“House of Saʿūd”),  rulers of Saudi Arabia. In the 18th century Muhammad ibn Saud (died 1765), chief of an Arabian village that had never fallen under control of the Ottoman Empire, rose to power together with the Wahhābī religious movement. He and his son ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz I (reigned 1765–1803) conquered much of Arabia; Saud I (reigned 1803–14) conquered the holy cities of Mecca and Medina in the early years of his rule. The Ottoman sultan induced the viceroy of Egypt to crush the Saudis and Wahhābīs, which was accomplished by 1818. A second Saudi state was formed in 1824 by Muhammad ibn Saud’s grandson Turkī (reigned 1823–34), who made Riyadh his capital. When Turkī’s son Fayṣal (reigned 1834–38; 1843–65) died, succession disputes led to civil war. Power did not return to Saudi hands until 1902, when Ibn Saud recaptured Riyadh. He established the kingdom of Saudi Arabia by royal decree in 1932. A number of his sons later ruled the country: Saud II (reigned 1953–64), Faisal (reigned 1964–75), Khalid (reigned 1975–82), Fahd (reigned 1982–2005), Abdullah (reigned 2005–15), and Salman (reigned 2015– ).
