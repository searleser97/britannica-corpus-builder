Sumra family,  dynasty under which the Lower Sindh (in present-day Pakistan) appears to have gained its independence in the 11th century. The house is given an Arab pedigree by its chroniclers, but historians believe it to be of Rajput origin. The Sumras ruled with relative success for more than three centuries, after which they were supplanted by the Sammas, who continued to govern Sindh until its conquest by the Mughal emperor Akbar.
In the 13th and early 14th centuries the Sumras had to stave off the intermittent attempts of Delhi sultans to claim suzerainty, but over time they became recognized as rulers of an independent principality.
