Sūr dynasty,  Afghan family that ruled in northern India from 1540 to 1556. Its founder, Shēr Shah of Sūr, was descended from an Afghan adventurer recruited by Sultan Bahlūl Lodī of Delhi during his long contest with the Sharqī sultans of Jaunpur. The shah’s personal name was Farīd; the title of Shēr (“Lion”) was conferred when, as a young man, he killed a tiger. After Bābur, founder of the Mughal dynasty, defeated the Lodīs, Shēr Shah of Sūr obtained control of the Afghan kingdoms of Bihar and Bengal and defeated the Mughal emperor Humāyūn at Chausa (1539) and Kannauj (1540). Shēr Shah ruled the whole of north India for five years, annexing Malwa and defeating the Rajputs. He reorganized the administration, laying foundations on which the Mughal emperor Akbar later built. He was killed by a cannonball while besieging the fortress of Kalinjar in central India.
Shēr Shah’s son, Islām, or Salīm Shah, was a man of ability and maintained Afghan rule despite dissensions. On his death in 1553, the Sūr dynasty broke up among rival claimants. Sikandar Sūr was defeated in June 1555 by Humāyūn, who occupied Delhi in July. When Muḥammad ʿĀdil Shah’s Hindu general Hemu threw off his allegiance only to be defeated by the Mughals at Panipat (1556), the Sūr dynasty ended. The Sūrs’ reign was a brief interlude in Mughal rule, brightened only by the brilliance of Shēr Shah. They were the last Afghan rulers of northern India.
