Rashtrakuta dynasty,  Hindu dynasty that ruled the Deccan and neighbouring areas of India from about 755 to 975 ce.
Probably originally Dravidian farmers, they were the royal family of Lattalur (Latur, near Osmanabad). They spoke Kannada but also knew the northern Deccan language. Under Rashtrakuta, who defeated a rival dynasty, the Chalukyas, the Deccan empire became the second greatest political unit in India, covering the area from Malwa in western India to Kanchi (Kanchipuram) in the southeast. The importance of the Rashtrakutas during this era is indicated by the fact that a Muslim traveler wrote of the king as being one of the four great rulers of the world—the others being the caliph (ruler of the Muslims) and the emperors of Byzantium and China.
Several Rashtrakuta monarchs were devoted to learning and the arts. Krishna I (reigned c. 756–773), built the rock temple of Kailasa at Ellora (designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983); another king, Amoghavarsha I, who reigned from about 814 to 878, was the author of part of the Kavirajamarga, the earliest known Kannada poem. Other kings were skilled in the art of war. Dhruva I subdued the Gangas of Gangavadi (Mysore), contained the Pallavas of Kanchi, and defeated the king of Bengal and the Pratihara king, who were contending for Kannauj. Krishna II, who succeeded in 878, reacquired Gujarat, which Amoghavarsha I had lost, but failed to retake Vengi. His grandson, Indra III, who came to the throne in 914, captured Kannauj and brought Rashtrakuta power to its peak. Krishna III outdid him in northern campaigns (c. 940) and in a spectacular occupation of Kanchi and much of the Tamil plains (948–966/967). Khottiga Amoghavarsha IV (968–972) failed to protect the capital, and its sack destroyed faith in the dynasty. The emperor fled to the Western Ghats, where his line lingered ignominiously, supported by brave Ganga and Kadamba feudatories, until Taila I Chalukya won the succession about 975.
