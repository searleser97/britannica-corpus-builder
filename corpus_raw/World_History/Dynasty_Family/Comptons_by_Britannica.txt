Compton’s by Britannica, formerly (1922–68) Compton’s Pictured Encyclopedia and (1968–2002) Compton’s Encyclopedia and Fact-Index,  a general reference work for home, school, and library, designed primarily for children and young people in the upper elementary grades and high school and for family use.
In the early 21st century Compton’s contained more than 8,000 main articles in 25 volumes. A 26th volume, the Fact-Index, included more than 26,000 shorter articles on subjects that might not be fully treated in the main articles, 63,500 brief entries, and nearly 300,000 references to main-entry text and cross-references within the Fact-Index.
Compton’s Pictured Encyclopedia was first published in eight volumes in 1922. (Its founder, Frank E. Compton, had previous experience in the field of encyclopaedia publication, having bought publication rights to the Student’s Cyclopedia in 1912.) The number of volumes had increased to 26 by 1974. Publishing rights to the F.E. Compton & Company products were acquired by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., in 1961.
Compton’s was called a “pictured” encyclopaedia because it was the first to use photographs and drawings on the same pages with the text. With the 1968 edition the word Pictured was removed from the title; the encyclopaedia remained nevertheless profusely illustrated, with recent editions containing more than 22,500 illustrations, including about 2,000 maps.
For use on personal computers, a single-disc CD-ROM (compact disc read-only memory) version of Compton’s was first released in 1990. Entitled Compton’s MultiMedia Encyclopedia, this first true multimedia encyclopaedia contained lavish graphics, animation, and sound. Compton’s MultiMedia Publishing Group was acquired by the Tribune Company, a Chicago-based media firm, in 1993 and merged into SoftKey International Inc. in 1996. Later in the decade the content from the print set, along with additional articles in the database, became available online. In 2002 publishing rights were again acquired by Encyclopædia Britannica, and the print product came to be known as Compton’s by Britannica. Other digital formats, such as e-books, were subsequently added.
