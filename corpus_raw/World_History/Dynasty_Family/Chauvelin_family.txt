Chauvelin Family,   prominent French family that had great influence in affairs of state from the 16th to 19th centuries and produced many notable diplomats and clergymen and several peers.
The first family member of note was Toussaint Chauvelin (d. c. 1552), who was a public prosecutor for parliament and then attorney general under Catherine de Médicis. His oldest son, François, became attorney general under Marie de Médicis. Bernard Chauvelin (1662–1755), great-grandson of Toussaint, was successively counsellor to parliament, steward of Tours, Bordeaux, and Amiens, and counsellor of state.
Louis de Chauvelin (b. 1640—d. July 31, 1719), the son of Louis Chauvelin (d. 1645), who was steward of the army of Italy, became counsellor to parliament and then steward of Picardie and Franche-Comté. At the time of his death he was counsellor of state. Germain-Louis Chauvelin (b. 1685—d. April 1, 1762) was general counsellor to parliament when he was appointed keeper of the seals (minister of justice) in 1727 and then secretary of state (1727–37) under the foreign minister Cardinal Fleury. Chauvelin’s policy was basically anti-Austrian, and the War of Polish Succession is considered largely his work. He proved himself quite capable but attracted the jealousy of Fleury, who exiled him. Henri-Philippe Chauvelin (b. April 18, 1714—d. Jan. 14, 1770), the son of Bernard, was the abbot of Montieramey and counsellor to the parliament. Along with his widespread political influence, he was known for his anti-Jesuitical writings.
Bernard-Louis, marquis de Chauvelin (b. March 1, 1716—d. Nov. 24, 1773), was the brother of Henri-Philippe and achieved great distinction as a soldier and diplomat. In 1732 he became a lieutenant in the king’s infantry and distinguished himself in the Italian campaign. Rising rapidly through the ranks, he became a commander of the army in Germany in 1735 and major general of infantry of the army in Italy in 1744 and fought valiantly in several campaigns until wounded. Created field marshal in 1745, he led several more diplomatic and military missions until sent as ambassador to Turin (1753–64). He took part in the Corsican campaign, which assured the annexation of that island to France.
His son, Bernard-François, marquis de Chauvelin (b. Nov. 29, 1766—d. April 9, 1832), succeeded his father as an attendant to Louis XVI. Raised with strong liberal ideals, Chauvelin welcomed the Revolution and fought with Rochambeau’s army. In 1792 he was made ambassador to London, where he succeeded in obtaining British neutrality. In spite of his efforts in its behalf, when he returned to Paris in the midst of the Terror the government imprisoned him, although he was later released. He was elected to the Tribunal in 1800 and the legislature in 1804, when Napoleon, recognizing his talents, appointed him prefect of Lys. Chauvelin carried out his duties well, instituting a great number of public works. With the Bourbon restoration, he sought to retire to private life; under the second restoration, however, he was again active in liberal politics, and in 1816 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies. He was an outstanding orator, known for his originality and eloquence, and proved to be one of the great defenders of liberalism and freedom of the press. Although reelected in 1827, he resigned in 1829.
