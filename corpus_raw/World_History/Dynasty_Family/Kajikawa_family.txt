Kajikawa Family,   (flourished  19th century), Japanese lacquerware artists whose school in Edo (now Tokyo) flourished for more than 200 years.
Kyūjirō (also called Kijirō) is generally acknowledged as the founder of the family and the inaugurator of its traditions. He excelled in designing particularly delicate lacquer inrō, portable medicine cases composed of a nest of tiny boxes tightly fitted into one another and secured with a silk cord. Because so much artistic skill went into decorating the outside of the inrō, they were worn on the obi (a broad sash) by men of the upper classes and were prized as collector’s items. Kajikawa artists also designed lacquer netsuke—toggles carved in the shapes of animals, human figures, and plants, used to attach medicine boxes and tobacco and money pouches to men’s sashes. Objects exemplifying the exquisite craftsmanship of the Kajikawa artists are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and in the Charles A. Greenfield Collection, New York City.
