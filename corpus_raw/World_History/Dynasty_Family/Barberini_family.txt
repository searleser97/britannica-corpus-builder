Barberini Family,   an aristocratic Roman family, originally of Barberino in the Else valley; they later settled first in Florence and then in Rome, where they became wealthy and powerful.
Antonio Barberini defended Florence in 1530 and then went to Rome, to which in 1555 he summoned his nephew Francesco (1528–1600), the real founder of the Barberini dynasty. Francesco and his brother Raffaelo accumulated the riches and trade advantages that became the base of the Barberini power. Francesco (1597–1679) was the first cardinal nominated by his uncle Pope Urban VIII (October 1623). The second family member Urban named cardinal was his brother Antonio the Elder (1569–1646), who is notable chiefly for encouraging the construction of religious buildings in Rome.
Antonio the Younger (1607–71), Urban’s nephew, who became the family’s third cardinal in 1628, proved himself an able negotiator and was entrusted with certain legations, including those of Urbano (1631) and Avignon (1633). A patron of the arts, he supported, among others, the Baroque sculptor and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598–1680). He also collected an extensive library, which after his death was absorbed into the great library of his brother Francesco.
The Barberini became universally hated and came into conflict with several powerful families, especially the Farnese, who formed a league against them and defeated them at Lagoscuro (March 30, 1644). This defeat, together with the death of Urban, severely weakened the position of the Barberini.
When the newly elected Innocent X (pope 1644–55) began an investigation into charges of the Barberini’s misuse of church funds, Taddeo, Francesco, and Antonio the Younger fled to Paris. Protected by the French cardinal Jules Mazarin, they enjoyed comfortable positions. With Mazarin’s help, and with the arrangement of the marriage of Taddeo’s son Maffeo to Olimpia Giustiniani, Innocent’s protégée, the Barberini were reconciled to Innocent in 1653. Taddeo died in Paris, but both Francesco (1648) and Antonio (1653) returned to Rome and lived in the magnificent Barberini Palace in Rome, built under the supervision of Bernini.
The family retained power for some time, mainly through wise marriages, including that of Lucrezia, daughter of Taddeo, to Francesco II, duke of Modena. The Barberini died out in 1736, and their estate passed to the Colonna.
