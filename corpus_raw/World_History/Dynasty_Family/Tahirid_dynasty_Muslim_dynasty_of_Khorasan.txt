Tahirid dynasty,  (821–873 ce), Islamic dynasty of Khorāsān (centred in northeastern Persia), which owed nominal allegiance to the Abbasid caliph at Baghdad but enjoyed virtual independence. The dynasty—generally considered to be the first native Iranian Islamic dynasty—was founded by Ṭāhir ibn al-Ḥusayn, a successful military general awarded the eastern lands by the caliph. Ṭāhir’s successors pushed their dominion as far as the Indian frontier.
