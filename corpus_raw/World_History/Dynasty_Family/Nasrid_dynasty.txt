Naṣrid dynasty,  last of the Muslim dynasties in Spain, rising to power following the defeat of the Almohads at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, in 1212. They ruled Granada from 1238 to 1492.
The first Naṣrid ruler, Muḥammad I al-Ghālib (d. 1273), a tributary vassal of the Christian king Ferdinand III of Castile and later of Alfonso X, began the construction of the Alhambra and laid the basis of Granada’s prosperity by welcoming Muslim refugees from Sevilla (Seville), Valencia, and Murcia. The Naṣrid rulers who succeeded Muḥammad, weakened by dynastic and factional strife, wavered between submission to Christian Castile and dependence on their Marīnid kinsmen of Fès (in modern Morocco); but the African alliance finally proved disastrous, leading to the defeat of the Naṣrid ruler Yūsuf I (1333–54) at Salado River (1340) by Alfonso XI. In 1469 Christian Spain united under the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. Then, when the Naṣrid ruler Abū al-Ḥasan ʿAlī (1466–85) introduced a succession struggle at home, while externally antagonizing Castile by refusing to pay tribute, Naṣrid rule was finally ended by the Christian conquest of Granada (1492).
