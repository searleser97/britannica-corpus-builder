Vere Family,   noted English family that held the hereditary office of lord great chamberlain from 1133 to 1779 and the earldom of Oxford from 1142 to 1703.
The family derived its name from the village of Ver, near Bayeux, in France. Its founder, Aubrey de Vere (c. 1040–1112), was a Norman who came to England with William the Conqueror and was granted lands by the latter in Essex, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, and Middlesex. His son Aubrey de Vere II (c. 1090–1141) was made lord great chamberlain of England in 1133. His son Aubrey de Vere III (c. 1110–1194) was created Earl of Oxford in 1142.
Robert (1362–92), the 9th Earl of Oxford, was a favourite of King Richard II. John (1442–1513), the 13th Earl of Oxford, was a Lancastrian leader in the Wars of the Roses and crowned King Henry VII in 1485. Two of the grandsons of John, the 15th earl, were notable soldiers who were known as the “fighting Veres”; Sir Francis (1560–1609) commanded the English troops in the Netherlands that fought against Spain in the service of the United Provinces, while his younger brother Sir Horace (1565–1635) fought in Germany during the Thirty Years’ War. Edward (1550–1604), the 17th Earl of Oxford, was a poet and dramatist who squandered much of the family’s wealth; he has sometimes been proposed as the real author of William Shakespeare’s plays.
After the death (1625) of Henry, the 18th earl, the office of lord great chamberlain passed to a distant cousin, Robert de Vere, whose descendants held the office until it passed to coheiresses in 1779. Aubrey de Vere (1627–1703) became the 20th and last Earl of Oxford in the Vere family. He died in 1703 without male issue, and his daughter Diana married Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St. Albans, who was an illegitimate son of King Charles II by the actress Nell Gwyn. Their third son, Vere Beauclerk, was created Baron Vere of Hanworth in 1750, and his fourth son, Aubrey, succeeded as 5th Duke of St. Albans in 1787.
