Ṣulayḥid dynasty,  (1047–1138), Muslim dynasty nominally subject to the Fāṭimid caliph in Egypt, responsible for restoring the Ismāʿīliyyah (an extremist Islamic sect) in Yemen.
The Ṣulayḥid family was brought to power by ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad (reigned 1047–67), who, through his association with the Fāṭimid dāʿī (propagandist) in the area, established a state in the mountains of Yemen. Within 20 years he displaced the Najāḥids, north of Yemen in the Tihāmah coastlands; the Zaydī imams in Ṣanʿāʾ, north Yemen (1063); and the Maʿnids of Aden, southeast of Yemen (1064). In the Hejaz (northwest coast of Arabia), once the stronghold of the Mūsāwid sharifs (descendants of Muḥammad), ʿAlī set up the Hāshimid sharifs (1063), who were to rule Mecca until the 1920s. By the end of the 11th century, however, al-Mukarram Aḥmad (reigned 1067–84), ʿAlī’s son, saw the Ṣulayḥid possessions begin to diminish: the Najāḥids reappeared in the north, while in the south Aden was given to the Zurayʿids, a related dynasty also of Ismāʿīlī persuasion. Late in his reign Aḥmad transferred effective control of the principality to his wife, al-Sayyidah Arwā. The Fāṭimids recognized her as suzerain of the kings of the Yemen until her death in 1138, when Yemen passed into Zurayʿid hands.
