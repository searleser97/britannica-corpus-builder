Valois Dynasty,   the royal house of France from 1328 to 1589, ruling the nation from the end of the feudal period into the early modern age. The Valois kings continued the work of unifying France and centralizing royal power begun under their predecessors, the Capetian dynasty (q.v.).
The House of Valois was a branch of the Capetian family, for it was descended from Charles of Valois, whose Capetian father, King Philip III, awarded him the county of Valois in 1285. Charles’s son and successor, Philip, count of Valois, became king of France as Philip VI in 1328, and thus began the Valois dynasty. The house subsequently had three lines: (1) the direct line, beginning with Philip VI, which reigned from 1328 to 1498; (2) the Valois-Orléans branch, which consisted of one member, Louis XII (reigned 1498–1515), son of Charles, duc d’Orléans, a descendant of King Charles V; and (3) the Valois-Angoulême branch, beginning with Francis I, son of Charles, count of Angoulême, another descendant of Charles V; it reigned from 1515 to 1574 and was succeeded by the Bourbon dynasty, another branch of the Capetians.
The early kings of the Valois dynasty were occupied primarily with fighting the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453), which broke out under Philip VI (reigned 1328–50). During this period the monarchy was threatened both by the English, who at times controlled much of France, and by the revived strength of feudal lords, such as the Armagnac and Burgundian factions, which challenged the supremacy of the kings. Charles VII (reigned 1422–61) met these threats and began the task of restoring royal power.
The Valois kings gradually increased their authority at the expense of the privileges of the feudal lords. The crown’s exclusive right to levy taxes and to wage war was established; and many of the basic administrative institutions that had begun to develop under the Capetians continued to evolve under the Valois; for example, the Parlements (courts) were extended throughout France to dispense royal justice. Their strong position in France enabled three of the Valois kings (Charles VIII, reigned 1483–98; Louis XII, reigned 1498–1515; and Francis I, reigned 1515–47) to undertake the ultimately unsuccessful Italian wars of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. These wars marked the start of Valois rivalry with the Habsburgs (ruling house of the Holy Roman Empire), a rivalry which lasted until the end of the French dynasty.
The French Renaissance occurred during the reigns of Francis I and Henry II (reigned 1547–59). The Wars of Religion (1562–98) weakened the power of the last Valois kings, for militant Roman Catholic and Protestant factions dominated politics.
