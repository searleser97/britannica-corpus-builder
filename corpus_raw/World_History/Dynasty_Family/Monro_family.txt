Monro family,  a family of three Scottish doctors—father, son, and grandson—who lifted Edinburgh University to international prominence as a centre of medical teaching in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Monros, all named Alexander and differentiated as primus, secundus, and tertius, held the chair of anatomy at Edinburgh for 126 years (1720–1846) without interruption. They exerted a great influence on medicine by contributing to the education of physicians and surgeons throughout the world besides making important additions to scientific knowledge.
Alexander primus (b. Sept. 8, 1697, London—d. July 10, 1767, Edinburgh) was the son of an army surgeon who later moved to Edinburgh, where Alexander received the M.D. degree. He then studied in Paris and Leiden before returning in the fall of 1719 to Edinburgh. There he was appointed professor of anatomy and surgery, beginning his lectures in the winter of 1720. He was not formally inducted into the professorship, however, until 1725. Alexander primus came to be known as an interesting lecturer who never used notes. In his lifetime he published two books and 53 separate papers; his writings were collected in one volume as Works (1781) by Alexander secundus. His anatomical preparations were outstanding. Though not a surgeon, he was greatly interested in surgery and advanced many new ideas in surgical instruments and dressings. Of his eight children, four of whom died when young, Donald (1727–1802) and Alexander secundus entered medicine. Alexander primus resigned his professorship in 1764.
Alexander secundus (b. May 22, 1733, Edinburgh—d. Oct. 2, 1817, Edinburgh) was only in his second year of medical study at Edinburgh in 1753 when he began giving the evening lectures for his father. On July 12, 1755, he was appointed coadjutor to his father. In that same year he received his M.D. degree and then continued his education in London, Paris, Leiden, and Berlin for two years before returning to Edinburgh, where he was appointed professor in 1758. Alexander secundus lectured from 1759 to 1807, being assisted by his son from 1800 to 1807. Of the three Monros, Alexander secundus is judged the greatest teacher and anatomist. His classes were well attended by students from all over the world, and his researches covered pathology and physiology as well as anatomy.
Alexander tertius (b. Nov. 5, 1773, Edinburgh—d. March 10, 1859, Craiglockheart, near Edinburgh) received the M.D. degree from Edinburgh in 1797. He then studied in London and Paris, returned to Edinburgh in 1800, and in that year was appointed conjointly with his father. Alexander tertius gave the entire course beginning in 1808 because of his father’s illness and became sole professor in 1817. He resigned in 1846. Alexander tertius did not rank with his father or grandfather as a teacher or scientific investigator, choosing largely to make use of the notes handed down to him. None of his works was of permanent value.
