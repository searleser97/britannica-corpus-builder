Elzevir Family, also spelled Elsevier,  a family of Dutch booksellers, publishers, and printers, 15 members of which were in business between 1587 and 1681. They were best known for their books or editions of the Greek New Testament and the classics.
Louis (1540?–1617), son of a printer of Leuven, settled in Leiden as a Protestant émigré about 1581, set himself up as a bookbinder and bookseller, published over 100 books, and began the family specialization in learned books. The business in Leiden enjoyed its greatest success between 1622 and 1652 under his son Bonaventure (1583–1652) and grandson Abraham (1592–1652), during which time they became printers to the university. Two notable and widely imitated series were their Petites Républiques, 35 volumes concerned with different countries and published between 1625 and 1649, and their literary classics. The Leiden bookshop was closed in 1659, but publishing and printing continued, although in declining quantity and quality, until 1681. Members of the family operated branches under the Elzevirs’ name at The Hague (c. 1590–1665), Utrecht (c. 1603–75), and Amsterdam (1638–81).
After having enjoyed an almost legendary reputation among bibliophiles for excellence of typography and design, the Elzevirs’ work is now regarded only as typical of the high quality that prevailed in their day in Holland. Among their four chief typographical devices, the “solitary,” consisting of an elm tree, a fruitful vine, and a man alone, with a motto Non solus (“Not alone”), is perhaps the best known.
