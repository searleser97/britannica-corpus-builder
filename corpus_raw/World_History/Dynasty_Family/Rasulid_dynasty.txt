Rasūlid dynasty,  Muslim dynasty that ruled Yemen and Ḥaḍramawt (1229–1454) after the Ayyūbids of Egypt abandoned the southern provinces of the Arabian Peninsula.
Although the family claimed descent from Qaḥṭān, the legendary patriarch of the southern Arabs, the Rasūlids were of Oğuz (Turkmen) origin, Rasūl having been a messenger (Arabic rasūl) for an ʿAbbāsid caliph. His son ʿAlī was governor of Mecca under the last Ayyūbid ruler of Yemen and succeeded him in the government of the whole country. ʿUmar I ibn ʿAlī (reigned 1229–50), Rasūl’s grandson, first established himself at Zabīd (Yemen), then moved into the mountainous interior, making Sanaa the Rasūlid capital. Though the Hejaz (west coast of Arabia) itself was a tributary of the Egyptian Mamlūks from 1252, ʿUmar also ruled the holy city Mecca.
For the next two centuries Yemen was an important and prosperous Muslim state; the Rasūlid ruler assumed the title of caliph in 1258. Political and trade relations were maintained with China, India, and Ceylon, and the opening of the port of Aden encouraged a lively international trade. Disturbances in Mecca around the middle of the 14th century, however, offered the Mamlūks an opportunity to intervene in Rasūlid affairs. Aḥmad ibn Ismāʿīl (reigned 1400–24) regained temporary control and offered Mamlūk trade in the Red Sea keen competition, but, soon after his death, internal unrest, revolts of slaves, and the plague hastened the fall of the dynasty. Yemen then passed into the hands of the Ṭāhirid dynasty until the Ottoman conquest of the 16th century.
