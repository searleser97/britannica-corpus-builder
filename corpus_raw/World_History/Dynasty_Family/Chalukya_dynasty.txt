Chalukya dynasty, Chalukya also spelled Calukya,  either of two ancient Indian dynasties. The Western Chalukyas ruled as emperors in the Deccan (i.e., peninsular India) from 543 to 757 ce and again from about 975 to about 1189. The Eastern Chalukyas ruled in Vengi (in eastern Andhra Pradesh state) from about 624 to about 1070.
Pulakeshin I, a petty chieftain of Pattadakal in the Bijapur district whose reign began in 543, took and fortified the hill fort of Vatapi (modern Badami) and seized control of the territory between the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers and the Western Ghats. After military successes farther north, his son Kirtivarman I (reigned 566–597) secured the valuable Konkan coast. The family then turned its attention to the fertile coastal regions to the northwest and east of the peninsula. Pulakeshin II (reigned c. 610–642) acquired parts of Gujarat and Malwa and defied the north Indian ruler Harsa of Kannauj; the boundary between them was fixed on the Narmada River. About 624, Pulakeshin II took the kingdom of Vengi from the Vishnukundins and gave it to his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana, the first Eastern Chalukya ruler.
In 641–647 the Pallavas ravaged the Deccan and captured Vatapi, but the Chalukya family recovered by 655 and extended its power in Gujarat. By 660 they had acquired land in Nellore district. Vikramaditya I (reigned 655–680) took Kanchipuram (ancient Kanci), at that time of the Pallava dynasty, about 670. Another Chalukya ruler, Vikramaditya II (reigned 733–746), again captured, but spared, the city, in 742. His successor, Kirtivarman II, was replaced by the Rashtrakuta dynasty in 757.
When the last Rashtrakuta fell, about 975, Taila founded the second Western Chalukya dynasty, named for the more central capital, Kalyani. His great achievement was to subdue the Paramara dynasty of Malwa.
The Chola king Rajaraja I invaded the south Deccan about 993, and repeated Chola invasions of the plateau occurred until about 1021. After many vicissitudes the Chalukya dynasty was supplanted by the Kalacuri family under Bijjala, who usurped the throne about 1156 and reigned until 1167. The Chalukya dynasty was restored in the person of Someshvara IV, who, however, lost the empire in 1189 to the Yadavas (or Sevunas) of Devagiri, the Hoysalas of Dorasamudra, and the Kakatiyas of Warangal—the rulers of the Telugu-speaking parts of the Deccan.
The descendants of Kubja Vishnuvardhana had to constantly fight for the riches of Vengi and were pawns in the struggle between the Chalukya Deccan emperors and the Chola kings. The Cholas eventually adopted the Chalukya family, and the two countries were united under Kulottunga I (Rajendra II), whose reign began in 1070.
