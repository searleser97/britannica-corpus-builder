Holkar dynasty,  Maratha rulers of Indore in India. The family, of peasant origin and of shepherd caste, was said to have migrated from the Mathura region to the Deccan village of Hol, or Hal, the name of which, coupled with kar (“inhabitant of”), became the family surname.
The dynasty’s founder, Malhar Rao Holkar, rose from peasant origins by his own ability. In 1724 Baji Rao I, the peshwa (prime minister) of the Maratha state, gave him command of 500 horses, and he soon became the peshwa’s chief general in Malwa, with headquarters at Maheshwar and Indore. At his death (1766) he was the virtual ruler of Malwa. From 1767 to 1794 his son’s widow, Ahalya Bai, ruled the state with great skill and understanding. Indore was an island of peace and prosperity in a sea of violence, and her rule became proverbial for justice and wisdom. Tukoji Holkar, a distant relative whom she had appointed as commander of her forces, succeeded her two years later; on his death, in 1797, his illegitimate son Jaswant Rao seized power.
At the outbreak of the Second Maratha War in 1803, Jaswant Rao remained neutral, but in 1804, after the defeat of Sindhia (one of the other states of the Maratha confederacy), he attacked the British and besieged Delhi. His forces were defeated, however, at Dig and Farrukhabad in November 1804, and he made peace a year later. Soon thereafter he became insane; he died in 1811. The Holkar family rule continued, marked by disputes and abdications, until the state’s end as a separate entity after Indian independence in 1947.
