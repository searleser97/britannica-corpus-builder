House of Lancaster,  a cadet branch of the house of Plantagenet. In the 15th century it provided three kings of England—Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI—and, defeated by the house of York, passed on its claims to the Tudor dynasty.
The family name first appeared in 1267, when the title of earl of Lancaster was granted to Edmund “Crouchback” (1245–96), the youngest son of Henry III. Two of Edmund’s sons by his second wife, Blanche of Artois, succeeded to the title: Thomas, earl of Lancaster (died 1322), and Henry, earl of Lancaster (died 1345). Henry’s son, Henry, 1st duke of Lancaster (died 1361), was survived only by two coheiresses. The elder daughter—Maud, married to William, duke of Bavaria—died without issue a year after her father. The Lancastrian inheritance thus fell to the younger daughter, Blanche, and to her husband, John of Gaunt (died 1399), third surviving son of Edward III. After Gaunt’s death his son Henry of Lancaster deposed Richard II and became king himself, as Henry IV. On his accession the duchy of Lancaster was merged in the crown, and the house of Lancaster, in the persons of Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI, ruled England for more than 60 years.
Henry V alone had the strength to rule, and his marriage to the daughter of King Charles VI of France did not improve his son’s chances. Henry IV had founded his title to the throne on the descent of Lancaster from Henry III in order to avoid the greater claim of the heirs of Gaunt’s elder brother Lionel, duke of Clarence. In the end his grandson was defeated by Edward IV of the house of York—the heir both of Clarence and of Gaunt’s younger brother Edmund, duke of York.
The last remaining fragment of Lancastrian title was that which Henry VII derived through the Beaufort family, comprising Gaunt’s legitimized natural children. By the time Henry VII had inaugurated the Tudor monarchy, the Lancaster lands were firmly in the hands of the crown.
