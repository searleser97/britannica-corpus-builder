Albert Thomas,  (born June 16, 1878, Champigny-sur-Marne, Fr.—died  May 7, 1932, Paris), French statesman, political leader, and historian, who was the first director of the League of Nations’ International Labour Organisation (1919–21).
Thomas graduated from the prestigious École Normale Supérieure in Paris, where he won scholarships that enabled him to do research in Russia, Germany, and the eastern Mediterranean on the topic of working-class history and the causes of socialism, trade-unionism, and the cooperative movement. His most significant scholarly work was Le Syndicalisme allemand (1903; “German Syndicalism”).
In 1904 Thomas was appointed assistant editor of L’Humanité, the official organ of the Socialist Party. He soon came to play a significant role as a leader of the moderate groups within the national labour movement. In 1910 he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, where he became one of the leaders of the moderate wing of the Socialist Party.
During World War I (1914–18) Thomas successfully organized the French railways. He became under secretary of state for artillery (1915) and then minister for munitions (1916–17). With the overthrow of the tsarist autocracy in Russia, Thomas was sent in April 1917 to Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) to work with the Russian provisional government under Aleksandr Kerensky on the production of munitions in an attempt by France to maintain cooperation with the new Russian republic.
After the war Thomas was appointed the first director of the League of Nations’ International Labour Organisation; he worked for the extension of its influence and the elaboration of international labour law. The claims of this work led him in 1921 to resign his seat in the Chamber.
