Sangoan industry,  sub-Saharan African stone tool industry of Acheulean derivation dating from about 130,000 to 10,000 years ago. It is more or less contemporaneous with the Fauresmith industry of southern Africa.
The Sangoan industry was discovered in 1920 at Sango Bay, Uganda, and is also found in Angola, Congo (Kinshasa), Kenya, and Zambia. Variant forms of Sangoan occur in Zimbabwe and South Africa. The Sangoan industry is characterized by a sort of pick, large planes for woodworking, hand axes, scrapers, and flake knives.
