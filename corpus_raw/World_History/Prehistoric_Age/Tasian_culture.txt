Tasian culture,  possibly the oldest-known cultural phase in Upper Egypt (c. 4500 bc).
The Tasian culture is best known from evidence found on the east bank of the Nile River at al-Badārī and at Deir Tasa. Tasian remains are somewhat intermingled with the materials of the subsequent Badarian stage, and, although the total absence of metal and the more primitive appearance of its pottery would seem to argue for an earlier date, it is also possible that the Tasian was contemporary with the Badarian. Archaeological remains indicate that the Tasians were settled farmers who cultivated emmer wheat and barley and raised herds of sheep and goats. Pottery vessels were reasonably well made, with open bowls and bag-shaped forms predominating. The dead were usually buried in straw coffins, with the bodies in crouching or bent positions.
