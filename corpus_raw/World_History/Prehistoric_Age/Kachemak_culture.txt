Kachemak culture,   a culture found around the Kachemak Bay of the southern Kenai Peninsula in central southern Alaska. It is divided into three phases, the oldest of which may date back as far as the 8th century bc and the most recent lasting until historic times. The first phase was more distinctly Eskimo in character than the later ones.
The Kachemak people lived in coastal settlements and hunted caribou, moose, bears, seals, and other sea mammals. They caught fish, birds, and mollusks. Whaling was probably practiced, although perhaps not at the beginning of the first phase. In the early period, stone (including slate) implements were usually retouched; later they were ground. Round or oval stone lamps and realistic human figures of carved stone are found. Copper tools and pottery appeared in the third stage. Rock paintings were generally highly stylized representations of men and animals.
Little is known of the earliest dwellings, but in the second stage houses were built of stones and whale vertebrae; later they were semisubterranean log structures. Dogs were kept during all three phases. Burials have been found with the body in a crouched position and with associated grave goods. During the final stage artificial bone or ivory eyes were placed over those of the deceased. Cultural connections with eastern Asia, with adjacent land areas, and with Kodiak Island have been suggested.
