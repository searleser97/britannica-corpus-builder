Claude-Joseph-Désiré Charnay,  (born May 2, 1828, Fleure, Fr.—died  Oct. 24, 1915, Paris), French explorer and archaeologist, noted for his pioneering investigations of prehistoric Mexico and Central America.
He was commissioned by the French government in 1857 and spent four years collecting relics in Mexico and compiling a photographic archive of the ruins he saw there. Later expeditions took him to Madagascar (1863), through North America (1867–70), South America (1875), and Australia and Oceania (1878).
Charnay’s explorations of the ancient cities of Central America (1880–83) were partly financed by the New York philanthropist Pierre Lorillard. Charnay developed a theory of Toltec migrations in which he argued that certain prehistoric peoples of Central America were of Asian origin. His major work on the subject was Les Anciennes Villes du Nouveau Monde (1885; The Ancient Cities of the New World).
