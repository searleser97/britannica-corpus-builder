Gabriel de Mortillet,  (born August 29, 1821, Meylan, France—died September 25, 1898, Saint-Germain-en-Laye), French archaeologist who formulated the first chronological classification of the epochs of man’s prehistoric cultural development. His ordering of the Paleolithic (Stone Age) epochs into Chellean, Acheulian, Mousterian, Solutrean, Magdalenian, and so on, continued into the 20th century as the basis for anthropological classification. Mortillet’s early studies of the geology and paleontology of the Alps were summarized in his Géologie et minéralogie de la Savoie (1858; “Geology and Mineralogy of Savoie”). He joined the staff of the Museum of National Antiquities, Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1868), was assistant curator for 17 years, and was professor of prehistoric anthropology at the School of Anthropology in Paris (1876–98). His classifications, elaborated in Le Préhistorique: antiquité de l’homme (1882; “The Prehistoric: Man’s Antiquity”), were revised in subsequent editions of the work.
