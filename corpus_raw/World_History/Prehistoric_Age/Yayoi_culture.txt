Yayoi culture,  (c. 300 bce–c. 250 ce), prehistoric culture of Japan, subsequent to the Jōmon culture. Named after the district in Tokyo where its artifacts were first found in 1884, the culture arose on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu and spread northeastward toward the Kantō Plain. The Yayoi people mastered bronze and iron casting. They wove hemp and lived in village communities of thatched-roofed, raised-floor houses. They employed a method of wet paddy rice cultivation, of Chinese origin, and continued the hunting and shell-gathering economy of the Jōmon culture.
Yayoi pottery, like earlier Jōmon ware, was unglazed. Pottery of the Early Yayoi period (c. 300–100 bce) was characterized by knife-incised surface decoration. During the Middle Yayoi period (100 bce–100 ce) pottery objects with comb-mark decorations appeared. Forms of this warm russet-coloured ware included tall footed vessels, large and small jars, bowls, and spouted vessels. Yayoi ware appears wheel-thrown but was made by the coiling method—that is, by preparing the clay in the shape of a rope and coiling it spirally upward. Surfaces were smoothed with a paddle or edging tool, then painted in red and polished to a high finish. Pieces produced in the last stage of the period were often undecorated.
Yayoi sites have yielded bronze mirrors and coins bearing similarities to Chinese Han-dynasty bronzes; ceremonial bronze weapons, swords, spears, and halberds; and bronze bells (dōtaku) decorated with incised geometric designs and matchstick drawings.
Yayoi pottery seems to be of two types, western and eastern, these being roughly geographically divided by the Inland Sea. Comparison of the bronzes, on the other hand, suggests the division of Yayoi culture into a western section around northern Kyushu, a central section around the Kinki area, and an eastern section around the Kantō Plain.
