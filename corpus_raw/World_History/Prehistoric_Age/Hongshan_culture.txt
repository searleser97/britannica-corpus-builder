Hongshan culture, also spelled Hung-shan culture,  (c. 4000–3000 bce)  prehistoric culture of far northern China. It appears to have had a three-tiered elite whose members were honoured with complex burials. Painted pottery found there may link it to Yangshao culture, while its beautiful jade artifacts link it to other jade-working cultures on the eastern coast, such as Liangzhu (c. 3300–2200 bce). See also Erlitou culture; Longshan culture.
