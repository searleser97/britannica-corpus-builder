Recuay,  pre-Columbian culture and site near present-day Recuay in the Callejón de Huaylas Valley of the northern highlands of Peru. Recuay culture dates to the Early Intermediate Period (c. 200 bc–ad 600) and was contemporaneous with the Moche culture of the neighbouring northern coast. Recuay is best known for its distinctive pottery, which features a type of decoration in three colours and a style of modeling in which small figures of men, jaguars, llamas, and other animals are affixed to the vessel. Recuay stone carving is related to that of the Pucará and Tiwanaku cultures.
