Thule culture,  prehistoric culture that developed along the Arctic coast in northern Alaska, possibly as far east as the Amundsen Gulf. Starting about 900 ce, it spread eastward rapidly and reached Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat) by the 12th century. It continued to develop in the central areas of Arctic Canada, and cultural communication persisted between these Eastern Thule and the Western Thule of Alaska from approximately 1300 to 1700.
Because Thule people resided in the Arctic, their economies were oriented toward hunting. Settlements of permanent houses built of whale bones, skin, and sod, some of them semisubterranean, were located near the seashore. Snowhouses were built during winter journeys inland to hunt terrestrial mammals, and skin tents were probably used for the same purposes in summer. Whales, seals, walrus, polar bears, caribou, musk oxen, and smaller mammals were hunted, while birds, fish, mussels, and wild plants were collected. Kayaks (one-man covered skin boats), umiaks (large, open, skin boats), and dog-drawn sleds provided transportation. Stone lamps and cooking pots, ground-slate implements, and whalebone artifacts were characteristic of the culture. Thule art includes small carved ivory or wooden figures, possibly used for magic or religious purposes or as game pieces.
Thule culture was highly developed and specialized and is considered to be the immediate antecedent to contemporary Arctic cultures. Thule people developed many implements and weapons that greatly influenced later Arctic cultural innovations. Thule culture disappeared from central Canada in the 15th century, probably because of climatic cooling that occurred during that time (the so-called Medieval Cool Period, 1250â€“1500).
