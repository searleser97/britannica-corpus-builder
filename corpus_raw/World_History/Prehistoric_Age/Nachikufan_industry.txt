Nachikufan industry,   industry of the African Late Stone Age practiced by hunting-gathering peoples who occupied the wooded plateaus of south-central Africa some 10,000â€“11,000 years ago. The Nachikufan tool industry is characterized by projectiles with several kinds of microlithic heads, heavy stone scrapers that were probably used for working wood and its by-products, flattish stones with centre-bored holes that served either as parts of a spring trap or for digging-stick weights, edge-ground axes, and grindstones for the preparation of wild foodstuffs.
