Chavín,  earliest highly developed culture in pre-Columbian Peru, which flourished between about 900 and 200 bc. During this time Chavín artistic influence spread throughout the northern and central parts of what is now Peru. The name given to this early civilization derives from the great ruin of Chavín de Huántar in the northern highlands of the Peruvian Andes, but that site may not have been the actual centre of origin of the culture and artistic style. Important regional manifestations are also found at Kotosh and Kuntur Wasi, in the highlands, and at sites in the Casma, Nepeña, and Chicama valleys of the northern coast. One of the best-known coastal phases is the Cupisnique of the Chicama valley.
The central building at Chavín de Huántar is a massive temple complex constructed of dressed rectangular stone blocks and containing interior galleries and incorporating bas-relief carvings on pillars and lintels. The principal motifs of the Chavín style are human, avian, feline, and crocodilian or serpentine figures; these are often combined in highly complex and fantastic images. Chavín de Huántar was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985.
Chavín culture undoubtedly had earlier prototypes in the Initial Period (c. 1800–900 bc). During this period a sedentary agricultural way of life became fully established in Peru, with the development of such crafts as weaving, pottery making, and stone carving. The significance of Chavín is that for the first time many of the local or regional cultures of the area were unified by a common ideology or religion. The extent of political unification remains uncertain.
