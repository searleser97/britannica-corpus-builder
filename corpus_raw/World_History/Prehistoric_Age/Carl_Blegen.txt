Carl Blegen, in full Carl William Blegen,  (born January 27, 1887, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.—died August 24, 1971, Athens, Greece), archaeologist who found striking evidence to substantiate and date the sack of Troy described in Homer’s Iliad. He also discovered, in 1939, clay tablets inscribed with one of the earliest known European scripts and dating from about 1250 bce.
While associated with the American School of Classical Studies, Athens (1913–27), Blegen excavated a number of sites, notably in the northeastern Peloponnese, of great importance for reconstructing the prehistory of Greece. With the British archaeologist A.J.B. Wace, he published a major advance in the method of dating pre-Mycenaean culture from pottery remains (1916–18). Blegen was professor of classical archaeology at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio (1927–57); he directed the university’s excavation of the mound of Hisarlık, Turkey, the site of Troy, from 1932 to 1938. There he and his staff found that the previously identified nine major periods of Troy’s construction, destruction, and rebuilding each represented two or more phases. His team’s stratigraphic study disclosed a total of 46 such phases. Moreover, Blegen suggested that the remains of King Priam’s Troy dated from the major period VIIa (c. 1250 bce), which offered evidence of large-scale human violence as well as fiery devastation. The research was described in Troy: Excavations Conducted by the University of Cincinnati, 1932–38, 4 vol. (1950–58), which he edited. Blegen published a popular account of his findings in Troy and the Trojans (1963).
Continuing to investigate sites described by Homer, Blegen returned to Greece in 1939 and sought to locate the Pylos of King Nestor. He decided upon Epano Englianos, a hilltop in Messenia, five miles north of the Bay of Navarino, as the probable site of Nestor’s palace. Excavation revealed the remains of a large structure or complex of structures. His most significant findings were the first examples of Greek writing, similar to the Linear B script found earlier in Crete. With continued excavation from 1952, more than 1,000 inscribed tablets were found at Pylos, and a fine 13th-century-bce Mycenaean palace was revealed. Remaining at Pylos until 1964, he also excavated a number of tombs that yielded exceptionally rich finds. Blegen and Marion Rawson edited The Palace of Nestor at Pylos in Western Messinia, 3 vol. (1966–73).
