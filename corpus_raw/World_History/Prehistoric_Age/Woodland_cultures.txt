Woodland cultures,   prehistoric cultures of eastern North America dating from the 1st millennium bc. A variant of the Woodland tradition was found on the Great Plains. Over most of this area these cultures were replaced by the Mississippian culture (q.v.) in the 1st millennium ad, but in some regions they survived until historic times.
The Woodland cultures were characterized by the raising of corn (maize), beans, and squash, the fashioning of particular styles of pottery, and the building of burial mounds.
