Cochise culture,   an ancient North American Indian culture that existed perhaps 9,000 to 2,000 years ago, known from sites in Arizona and western New Mexico and named for the ancient Lake Cochise, now a dry desert basin called Willcox Playa, near which important finds were made. The Cochise was a desert culture, contrasting with the big-game hunting cultures to the east (see Clovis complex; Folsom complex), and emphasized gathering and collecting wild plant foods rather than hunting; in later stages, there are evidences of incipient agriculture.
The Cochise culture has been customarily divided into three developmental periods. The earliest stage, Sulphur Spring, dates from 6000 or 7000 bc to about 4000 bc and is characterized by milling stones for grinding wild seeds and by various scrapers, but no knives, blades, or projectile points, although the remains of food animals, both extinct and modern, indicate that some hunting was done. During the second stage, Chiricahua, lasting from 4000 to perhaps 500 bc, the appearance of projectile points would seem to indicate an increased interest in hunting, and the remains of a primitive form of maize suggest the beginnings of farming; food-gathering was still important, however. In the final or San Pedro stage, from 500 bc to about the time of Christ, milling stones were replaced by mortars and pestles, and pit houses (houses of poles and earth built over pits) appeared. During the San Pedro stage, pottery appeared in the area of the Mogollon Indians (see Mogollon culture). The Cochise tradition may be taken as the base for subsequent cultural developments among various Indians in the Southwest.
