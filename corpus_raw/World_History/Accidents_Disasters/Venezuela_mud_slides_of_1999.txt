Venezuela mud slides of 1999,  devastating mud slides in Venezuela in December 1999. An estimated 190,000 people were evacuated, but thousands of others, likely between 10,000 and 30,000, were killed.
Over the course of 10 days in December 1999, torrential rains inundated the mountainous regions of Venezuela, causing deadly mud slides that devastated the state of Vargas and other areas in the northern part of the country. The coastal regions were hardest hit, with a 60-mile (100-km) stretch of coastline being wiped out. December 16 saw the most destruction, due to particularly heavy rains throughout the previous day and evening. Flooding caused additional damage and misery.
A state of emergency had been declared in Vargas as early as December 6. As the magnitude of the crisis intensified on December 15 and 16, the government, headed by Pres. Hugo Ch√°vez, brought in the military to aid in evacuation efforts and to restore order to areas rampant with looters. The American and Venezuelan Red Cross agencies quickly joined the relief effort and established outposts where victims could receive food and medical care. Although all members of society were affected, the poorest citizens suffered the greatest losses, as the raging mud and water had obliterated countless flimsy residences and shantytowns. The disaster highlighted the need for the country to rethink its land-development and environmental policies. (See also landslide.)
