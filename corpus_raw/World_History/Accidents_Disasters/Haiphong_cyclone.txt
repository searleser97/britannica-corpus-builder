Haiphong cyclone,  (Oct. 8, 1881), one of most catastrophic natural disasters in history and the third deadliest tropical cyclone ever recorded. The cyclone smashed into the Gulf of Tonkin, setting off tidal waves that flooded the city of Haiphong in northeastern Vietnam, caused widespread destruction, and killed an estimated 300,000 inhabitants.
Located on a branch of the Red River delta on its northeastern edge, the port city of Haiphong is situated about 10 miles (16 km) inland from the Gulf of Tonkin. It is connected to the sea by an access channel, which, during the storm, magnified the extent of the flooding and destruction. Developed as a seaport by the French starting in 1874, the city had always been crucial to the economy of the region (today, it functions as the outport of the capital, Hanoi); thus, the effects of the cyclone were devastating to the region. The storm’s direct death toll of 300,000 (more are thought to have died of disease and starvation later) ranks it behind only the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta (“Bhola”) cyclone that devastated East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1970 and the Hugli (Hooghly) River cyclone that hit the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent in 1737. The exact category and strength of the Haiphong cyclone are not known, as is the case for many meteorological events and natural disasters that took place before the 20th century.
