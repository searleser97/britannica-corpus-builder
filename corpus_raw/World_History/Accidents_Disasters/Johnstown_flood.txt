Johnstown flood,  disastrous flood that occurred in 1889 in the town of Johnstown, Pa. Johnstown lies at the confluence of the Conemaugh River and Stony Creek; at the time of the flood it was a leading U.S. steelmaking centre. At 3:10 pm on May 31, the South Fork Dam, a poorly maintained earthfill dam holding a major upstream reservoir, collapsed after heavy rains, sending a wall of water rushing down the Conemaugh valley at speeds of 20–40 mph (32–64 kph). A 30-foot (9-metre) wall of water smashed into Johnstown at 4:07 pm, killing 2,209 people.
