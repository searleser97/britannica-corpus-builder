Hurricane Camille,  hurricane (tropical cyclone), one of the strongest of the 20th century, that hit the United States in August 1969. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane struck the Mississippi River basin. As the storm moved inland across much of the southeastern United States and Appalachia, it caused severe flash flooding.
Hurricane Camille started as a tropical storm on Aug. 14, 1969, west of the Cayman Islands and rapidly gained strength as it moved toward Cuba. On August 16 the storm was a category 5 hurricane, the highest classification on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. Late on the night of August 17, the storm hit Bay Saint Louis in Mississippi. Camille’s gusts were powerful enough to knock out all wind-recording instruments, leaving some experts estimating wind speed at more than 200 miles (320 km) per hour. Parts of the Gulf of Mexico coast experienced tides more than 24 feet (7 metres) high. As the storm moved northeast through the Ohio Valley and into Virginia, it weakened to a tropical depression. Before it entered the Atlantic Ocean on August 20, Camille dumped 12–20 inches (300–500 mm) of rain in parts of West Virginia and Virginia, which experienced devastating floods and landslides.
Before the hurricane made landfall, projections of the path of the storm varied. More than 150,000 people were instructed to evacuate their homes. Most left the affected areas in time, but ultimately, more than 250 people were killed. In addition to the loss of life, there were major economic losses resulting from storm damage as well as the relief and recovery efforts that followed.
