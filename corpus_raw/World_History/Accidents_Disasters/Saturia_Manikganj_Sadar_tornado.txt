Saturia–Manikganj Sadar tornado,  catastrophic tornado that struck the Manikganj district of Bangladesh on April 26, 1989. Causing approximately 1,300 fatalities, it was likely the deadliest tornado in recorded history.
The tornado struck at around 6:30 pm local time and moved east from the Daulatpur area into the areas of Saturia and Manikganj Sadar—a region that had been suffering from a severe drought. The storm spanned a path that was about 10 miles (16 km) long and about 1 mile (1.6 km) wide. Though confined to a relatively small geographic region (like most other tornadoes) and brief in duration, it completely destroyed all buildings within an area of roughly 2.5 square miles (6 square km). Towns lay in ruins, and tens of thousands of residents were left homeless. In addition, thousands of trees were uprooted and blown away. Though the deadliest, the Saturia–Manikganj Sadar tornado was only one of numerous devastating storms to hit Bangladesh in recent history. On April 17, 1973, another tornado in the Manikganj region had killed at least 681 people.
