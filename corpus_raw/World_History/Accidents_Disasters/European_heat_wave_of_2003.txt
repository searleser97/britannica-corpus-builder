European heat wave of 2003,  record high temperatures across Europe in 2003 that resulted in at least 30,000 deaths (more than 14,000 in France alone). The heat wave raised concerns over global warming and, in particular, Europe’s readiness for climate change.
In the summer of 2003 an anticyclone stationed above western Europe prevented precipitation and led to record high temperatures over sustained periods. During the heat wave, which began in June and continued through mid-August, temperatures soared to 20–30 percent above average. Even nightly temperatures were higher than the average summer midday highs. The heat was particularly severe in France, where the temperature remained around 99 °F (37 °C) for more than a week in August in some areas. The intensity of the heat, as well as its duration, wrought havoc on the unprepared European population. The elderly were particularly susceptible to the heat, as were those who were chronically ill or isolated from sources of aid. The disaster was one of the deadliest in Europe in a century.
The heat wave also affected the environment. Alpine glaciers shrank by 10 percent over the summer, and thawing in the mountains reached greater depths and occurred at higher altitudes than on average, contributing to rock slides. Forest fires raged across western Europe as weakened trees and dry underbrush fed the flames. The heat affected harvests as well: fodder and grain production declined, elevating costs for livestock farmers. In addition, high water temperatures and low water levels shut down French nuclear power facilities just when demand for electricity peaked.
