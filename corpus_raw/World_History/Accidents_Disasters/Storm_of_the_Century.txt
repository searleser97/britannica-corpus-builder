Storm of the Century, also called 1993 Superstorm,  large, intense storm system that devastated the eastern coast of North America during March 12–15, 1993. As it moved from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada, the storm killed more than 250 people.
The storm began as a low-pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico and then strengthened as it moved northward. With the system came extremely strong winds, heavy precipitation, snowstorms, and cold temperatures. Wind gusts were recorded at more than 70 miles (110 km) per hour at La Guardia Airport in New York City and at more than 140 miles (225 km) per hour at Mount Washington in New Hampshire. At the storm’s height, snow fell at a rate of 2–3 inches (50–75 mm) per hour in some areas. Record snowfall hit parts of Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia. Total amounts ranged from about 6 inches (150 mm) in Florida’s panhandle to more than 55 inches (1,400 mm) in the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. In addition to snow and unseasonably cool temperatures, Florida endured about a dozen tornadoes as well as huge coastal waves. At least 44 people in that state alone were killed by the storm. The harsh weather conditions caused every major interstate highway and airport along the Eastern Seaboard to be closed at some point during the storm, and several ships along the coast sank. Numerous roofs collapsed under the weight of accumulated snow, and millions of homes and businesses lost electrical power.
