Monongah mining disaster of 1907,  deadly mining explosion on Dec. 6, 1907, in Monongah, W.Va., that killed more than 350 miners.
The West Virginia coal mine that was the site of the disaster had an extensive maze of underground tunnels. About 10:00 am on December 6, an underground explosion occurred in one section, with a larger blast following in a separate area. At this time of day the mine was full of workers, many of them young boys. The explosion was strong enough to collapse the entrance of the mine as well as destroy the ventilation system; because of this, poisonous gases collected in the mine shaft. The vast majority of miners were killed; those who survived the initial blast likely perished from suffocation or poisoning. The cause of the disaster was never fully understood. Some speculated that a spark ignited methane gas, which in turn ignited highly flammable coal dust that spread fire throughout the mine system.
The Monongah disaster unleashed a wave of concern about mining safety. During this time, mining disasters in the United States were becoming increasingly common. Government regulations in Europe had diminished mining accidents there, and many Americans began lobbying for stronger federal safety rules for mining companies. In 1910 the government established the Bureau of Mines, an agency responsible for reducing mining accidents, but strict safety standards were not enforced until the mid-20th century.
