Tirol avalanches of 1916,  series of massive avalanches in December 1916 that killed as many as 10,000 troops in the mountainous Tirol region, an area now occupying the northern part of Italy and the western part of Austria.
As World War I escalated, Austro-Hungarian and Italian soldiers positioned themselves on the highest peaks of the snowy Alps, using the height as an advantage against enemy combatants. Weapons and other machinery were dragged up the mountainsides, tunnels were dug into some peaks, and forts and living quarters were built among the crags. The 1915â€“16 winter in the Alpine region was one the snowiest on record, with more than 40 feet (12 metres) of snow falling in some areas. The heavy accumulation, combined with the detonation of explosives planted underneath enemy positions, resulted in huge snowslides that took out thousands of troops from each side. Many soldiers remain buried and frozen in the snow; some bodies were recovered as many as 80 years later.
