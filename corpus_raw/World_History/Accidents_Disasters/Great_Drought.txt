Great Drought,  climatic interval of the Holocene Epoch that affected much of what is now the western United States and had a profound influence upon the plants, animals, and prehistoric Native American cultures of the region. The Holocene began about 11,700 years ago and continues to the present. The region affected by the Great Drought encompassed the area that extended from what is now Oregon to southern California and east to what is now eastern Texas; dendrochronology, or tree-ring studies, indicate that it began in ad 1276 and continued through 1299.
Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) and Hohokam peoples were particularly affected by the Great Drought; their agricultural economies had by this time enabled them to form densely occupied communities. After repeated years of crop failure, they were compelled to abandon their towns and disperse across the land. Parallel reductions in wild food sources affected nomadic peoples, and social disruptions are thought to have occurred as nomads and former farmers were placed in competition for the few resources that survived under very dry conditions.
The Great Drought was but one of several major periods of drought that have affected the same region in the past three millennia. Other periods of drought that have been identified are the Fairbank Drought of 500 bc and the Whitewater Drought of ad 300. Notably, all these dates appear to be related to major upheavals in the cultures of North and Central America.
