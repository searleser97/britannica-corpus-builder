Japan Airlines flight 123, also called Mount Osutaka airline disaster,  crash of a Japan Airlines (JAL) passenger jet on August 12, 1985, in southern Gumma prefecture, Japan, northwest of Tokyo, that killed 520 people. The incident is one of the deadliest single-plane crashes in history.
Domestic flight JAL 123 departed Tokyo’s Haneda airport at 6:12 pm and was scheduled to land in Ōsaka one hour later. The Boeing 747 was completely booked; it was the eve of the Japanese holiday Bon, and many people were going home to see relatives or going on vacation. The plane had left Tokyo airspace and had ascended to 24,000 feet (7,300 metres) when the first distress calls came from the plane’s pilot, who initially reported losing altitude and then reported difficulty controlling the plane. The plane fell to around 10,000 feet (3,000 metres). The pilot continued to send distress calls and asked to be rerouted to the Tokyo airport. But about 45 minutes after takeoff, the plane crashed into Mount Takamagahara near Mount Osutaka (the latter mountain was the first reported crash site and became the popular name for the crash) in the Kantō Range.
Rescue attempts were made difficult by the remote and treacherous location of the crash site. Not until 14 hours after the crash were emergency rescue crews able to reach the area. Paratroopers descended from helicopters onto the scene, and some rescue volunteers reached the remote area on foot. Of the 524 people on the plane, 4 survived. The crash was attributed to a missing tail fin that was likely structurally weakened because of frequent landings and takeoffs. Many aviation experts credited the pilot for keeping the damaged plane in the air for almost a half hour after reporting difficulty.
