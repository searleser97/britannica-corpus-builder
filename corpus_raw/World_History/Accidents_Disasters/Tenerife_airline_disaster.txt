Tenerife airline disaster,  runway collision of two Boeing 747 passenger airplanes in the Canary Islands on March 27, 1977, that killed more than 580 people.
Both planes involved in the crash had been scheduled to depart from Las Palmas on the island of Gran Canaria. However, a terrorist bombing there earlier in the day caused the planes to be diverted to the small Los Rodeos Airport on the island of Tenerife. Later, just as KLM flight 4805 prepared to take off from the single airstrip at Los Rodeos, the plane barreled into Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) flight 1736, which had been taxiing toward takeoff at the same time. The force from the crash tore through the fuselage of the Pan Am plane, and both aircraft exploded into flames. All passengers and crew members aboard the KLM plane were killed. At least 330 people on the Pan Am plane died, but more than 60, including the pilot, survived the impact and fire. Many survivors escaped from a hole near the planeâ€™s left wing. Some experts speculated that the KLM plane had begun its takeoff without proper clearance, though a number of factors, including foggy weather and unusual airport traffic conditions, likely played a role in the disaster.
