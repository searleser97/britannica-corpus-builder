Typhoon Nina–Banqiao dam failure,  catastrophic dam failure in August 1975 in western Henan province, China, caused by a typhoon (tropical cyclone). The ensuing floods caused more than 150,000 casualties, making it one of the deadliest typhoon disasters in history.
The Banqiao Dam had been built on the Ru River in the early 1950s as part of a flood-prevention and electricity-production program aimed at controlling the Huang He (Yellow River). At a height of 387 feet (118 metres) and with a storage capacity of some 17.4 billion cubic feet (492 million cubic metres), it was designed to withstand a “1,000-year” flood (i.e., a flood level expected once every millennium). However, Typhoon Nina produced floods that were twice the 1,000-year levels as it stalled over Henan in early August. The first day’s total precipitation exceeded 40 inches (1,000 mm), surpassing the area’s total annual precipitation by some one-fifth, and three more days of heavy downpours followed.
The dam began to collapse shortly after 1:00 am on August 8, creating a rush of water up to 33 feet (10 metres) high and 7 miles (11 km) wide in some areas, traveling at about 30 miles (50 km) per hour. The town of Daowencheng, just downstream, was immediately inundated, and all 9,600 citizens were killed. A total of 61 other dams and reservoirs also failed that day as a result of the typhoon and the ensuing floods, including the second largest dam in the flood-prevention system, the Shimantan Dam on the Hong River. The absence of an early-warning system or an evacuation plan exacerbated the disaster, and 26,000 people died in the floods, according to the official death toll. In addition, an estimated 145,000 people died from epidemics (caused by contamination of the water) and from famine; some estimates put the total death toll at more than 220,000. The number of people affected by the disaster exceeded 10 million.
In the disaster’s aftermath, Chinese officials undertook a countrywide examination of its reservoirs. A prominent hydrologist, Chen Xing, whose warnings and criticisms had gone unheeded during construction of the Banqiao Dam, was brought back to help in clearing the river channels. Many of the 62 dams destroyed were rebuilt, including Banqiao (completed in 1993) and Shimantan (1996).
