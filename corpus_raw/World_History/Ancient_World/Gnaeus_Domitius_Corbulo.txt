Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo,  (died ad 67), Roman general who restored Roman control over Armenia.
In ad 47 Corbulo was victorious over the German tribe of the Frisii on the Rhine, thereby restoring them to Roman tributary status. Appointed legate of Galatia and Cappadocia (two provinces to the west of Armenia) by the emperor Nero in 54, Corbulo was ordered to recover Armenia from Tiridates, brother of the Parthian king Vologases. In 58 he invaded Armenia and installed Tigranes, a Roman client, on the throne.
When Tigranes provoked a new attack by the Parthians in 61, Nero sent the general Lucius Caesennius Paetus to Armenia and ordered Corbulo to defend Syria. Paetus surrendered to the Parthians at Rhandeia in 62, and Corbulo then invaded Armenia and reestablished Roman ascendancy. He remained in Syria until 66, when his son-in-law, Annius Vinicianus, was caught conspiring against Nero. Recalled to Rome, Corbulo was forced to commit suicide.
