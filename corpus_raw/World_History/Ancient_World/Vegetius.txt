Vegetius,  in full Flavius Vegetius Renatus,  (flourished  4th century ad), Roman military expert who wrote what was perhaps the single most influential military treatise in the Western world. His work exercised great influence on European tactics after the Middle Ages.
A patrician and reformer with little actual military experience, Vegetius lived in an era when cavalry and foreign auxiliary levies had diluted and corrupted the traditional legionary formation, which had been based on a disciplined infantry and cohesive organization. His treatise Rei militaris instituta, also called Epitoma rei militaris, written sometime between 384 and 389, advocated a revival of the old system but had almost no influence on the decaying military forces of the later Roman Empire. His rules on siege craft and on the need for discipline, however, were studied during the Middle Ages; partly because Vegetius was the first Christian Roman to write on military affairs, his work became, and remained for centuries, the military bible of Europe. George Washington owned and annotated a copy of Vegetius’s treatise, which is full of aphorisms such as “If you want peace, prepare for war.”
