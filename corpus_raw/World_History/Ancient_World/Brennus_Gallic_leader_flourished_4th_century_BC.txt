Brennus,  (flourished 4th century bc), chief of the Senones, who in 390 or 387 bc annihilated a Roman army, occupied and plundered Rome, and exacted a heavy ransom before withdrawing. He is famous for his reputed saying, “Vae victis” (“Woe to the vanquished”). The name, which is not found in the best sources, may be invented.
