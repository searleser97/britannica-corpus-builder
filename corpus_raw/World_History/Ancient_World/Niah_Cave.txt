Niah Cave,   site of significant archaeological evidence concerning prehistoric man’s existence in Southeast Asia, located on the island of Borneo, East Malaysia, 10 miles (16 km) inland from the South China Sea. The Niah Cave provides examples of early Pleistocene man’s habitat in Sarawak and was the site of almost continuous human dwelling until the 19th century. The cave was first described to Westerners in 1864 by Alfred Russel Wallace, the originator, along with Charles Darwin, of the theory of natural selection. Although a Sarawak civil servant visited the cave seven years later, only in the 20th century, following its purchase by the Sarawak Museum, was the importance of the site revealed.
The Niah Cave itself is massive, with five openings, or mouths. The main cave is called the painted cave because of red hematite wall and ceiling paintings. Its mouth is about 300 feet (90 m) high by 600 feet (180 m) wide. While other sections of the cave are dark, moist, and inhabited by millions of bats and swiftlets, the painted cave is dry, well lit, and favourable for human dwelling. The first archaeological digging, by Tom Harrisson in 1954, uncovered considerable evidence of past human habitations. The earliest flakes and chopper tools date from about 40,000 bc. The most important discovery at Niah was the remains of a skeleton of an adolescent male, about 38,000 bc, the earliest Homo sapiens remains found in the Far East to that time; these bones are of particular interest because this individual lived at the same time as Solo man of Java, the Rhodesioids of Africa, and the classic Neanderthals of Europe—all Homo sapiens, but of far less modern looking and gracile (slender) type. Other discoveries include the burial place “boats of the dead.”
