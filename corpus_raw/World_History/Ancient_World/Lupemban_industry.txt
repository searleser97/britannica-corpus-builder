Lupemban industry, also called Lupembian Industry,  a sub-Saharan African stone tool industry dating from the late Pleistocene, beginning about 40,000 years ago. The Lupemban industry was derived from and replaced the Sangoan industry, which is found in forested areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The Lupemban industry is characterized by fairly small, well-shaped tools: chisels, adzes, planes (probably demonstrating intensive woodworking), sidescrapers, and blades. The most characteristic Lupemban tool is an elongate, lanceolate bifacial point that is often very finely and beautifully flaked.
