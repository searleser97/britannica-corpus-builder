Harpagus,   (flourished  6th century bc), Median general who first served Astyages, the last king of the Median Empire, but later deserted to the Achaemenid king Cyrus II.
Harpagus, leading an army, was sent by Astyages to fight his disloyal vassal Cyrus; instead, Harpagus and his troops joined with Cyrus, perhaps, as some scholars have suggested, in revenge for Astyages’ murder of Harpagus’ son. Harpagus remained an important military figure under Cyrus, undertaking among other efforts the conquest of western Asia Minor. He was later made a satrap (governor), and his family continued to hold high positions throughout the Achaemenid Empire.
