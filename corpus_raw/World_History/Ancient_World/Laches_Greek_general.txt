Laches,  (born c. 475 bc—died  418), a rich Athenian aristocrat who played a leading part in the first phase of the Peloponnesian War.
Laches was an associate of Socrates and was a conservative. Elected general in 427 bc, he was replaced in 425 after he undertook an unsuccessful mission to support Athenian interests in Sicily and was prosecuted by Cleon (Aristophanes satirized the trial in his comedy The Wasps). Temporarily eclipsed, he gained politically by the Athenian defeats of 424 at Megara and at Delium and proposed the decree that brought the year’s armistice in 423. When the death of Cleon (422) made peace with Sparta possible, Laches served on the commission that negotiated terms. Then he supported Nicias’ attempts to preserve the peace but could not prevent the dangerous alliance of Athens with Argos and Mantineia. He died in command of the Athenian force when this alliance was destroyed at the Battle of Mantineia (418). A dialogue of Plato’s, on bravery, is known by his name.
