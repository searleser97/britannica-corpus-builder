Tiglath-pileser II,   (flourished  10th century bc), king of Assyria (c. 965â€“c. 932 bc). He apparently ruled effectively, as a successor addressed him by a title reserved for mighty monarchs. Otherwise, little is known of the period other than that Assyria was beginning to emerge from its collapse of a century before.
