W.F. Albright, in full William Foxwell Albright,  (born May 24, 1891, Coquimbo, Chile—died  Sept. 19, 1971, Baltimore, Md., U.S.), American biblical archaeologist and Middle Eastern scholar, noted especially for his excavations of biblical sites.
The son of American Methodist missionaries living abroad, Albright came with his family to the United States in 1903. He obtained his doctorate in Semitic languages at Johns Hopkins University. While there he studied under Paul Haupt, whom he succeeded in 1929 as W.W. Spence professor of Semitic languages, a position he held until his retirement in 1958.
Appointed fellow of the American School of Oriental Research, Jerusalem, in 1919, Albright served as the school’s director for 12 years (1920–29, 1933–36). Among his excavations were Gibeah of Saul, Tell Beit Mirsim (Kirjath-Sepher), and, in association with others, Beth-zur and Bethel in Palestine and Baluah, and Petra in Jordan. In 1950–51 he was chief archaeologist of excavations made by the American Foundation for the Study of Man at Wadi Bayhan (Beihan), Hajar Bin Humaid, and Timna in Arabia. Albright early stressed the value of archaeology and of topographical and linguistic studies for biblical history and in making pottery and potsherd identification a reliable scientific tool.
Albright’s scientific writings greatly influenced the development of biblical and related Middle Eastern scholarship and include The Archaeology of Palestine and the Bible (1932–35), The Vocalization of the Egyptian Syllabic Orthography (1934), The Excavation of Tell Beit Mirsim (1932–43), From the Stone Age to Christianity (1940–46), Archaeology and the Religion of Israel (1942–46), and The Bible and the Ancient Near East (1961).
