Ghassulian culture,   archaeological stage dating to the Middle Chalcolithic Period in southern Palestine (c. 3800–c. 3350 bc). Its type-site, Tulaylāt al-Ghassūl, is located in the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea in modern Jordan and was excavated (1929–38) by the Jesuits. The Ghassulian stage was characterized by small settlements of farming peoples, immigrants from the north, who built mud-brick, trapezoid-shaped houses or underground dwellings and created remarkable polychrome wall paintings. Their pottery was elaborate in style, and included footed bowls and horn-shaped goblets. Several samples display the use of sculptural decoration or of a reserved slip (a clay and water coating partially wiped away while still wet). The Ghassulians also smelted copper. Evidence indicates that they buried their dead in stone dolmens.
Ghassulian culture has been identified at numerous other places in southern Palestine, especially in the region of Beersheba. The Ghassulian culture correlates closely with the Amratian of Egypt and also seems to have affinities (e.g., the distinctive churns, or “bird vases”) with early Minoan materials in Crete.
