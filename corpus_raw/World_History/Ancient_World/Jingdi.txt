Jingdi, Wade-Giles romanization Ching-ti, personal name (xingming) Liu Qi,  (died 141 bc, China), posthumous name (shi) of the fifth emperor of the Han dynasty, during whose reign (157–141 bc) an attempt was made to limit the power of the great feudal princes, who had been enfeoffed in separate kingdoms during the tolerant rule of Jingdi’s father, the Wendi emperor (reigned 180–157 bc).
In 154 the feudal princes reacted against attempts to curtail their power. The resulting Revolt of the Seven Kingdoms was crushed; the lords were thereafter denied the right to appoint the ministers for their fiefs, and their domains were divided among their sons. This move consolidated the power of the central government and prepared the way for the glorious reign of Jingdi’s son, the famous Wudi (reigned 141–87 bc).
