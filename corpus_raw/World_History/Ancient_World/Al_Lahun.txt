Al-Lāhūn, also spelled El Lahun or Illahun,  ancient Egyptian site, located southwest of Al-Fayyūm near the southward turn of the Baḥr Yūsuf canal in Al-Fayyūm muḥāfaẓah (governorate). Al-Lāhūn was the location of a Middle Kingdom (1938–c. 1630 bce) pyramid and of a workmen’s village of approximately the same date, and findings in the early 21st century revealed that it was a significant site in the Early Dynastic period (c. 2925–c. 2575 bce) as well.
The pyramid, built by King Sesostris II (reigned 1844–37 bce), fourth of the eight kings of the 12th dynasty (1938–c. 1756), was unusual in that the entrance to the burial chamber was not in the north side of the pyramid but was found instead to the south of the structure. Although the pyramid itself was robbed in antiquity, a treasure of jewelry was discovered in the tombs of the princesses, located within the pyramid enclosure. In technical perfection and artistic mastery this collection easily rivals all other Middle Kingdom objects of its type.
Excavation of the village, which was also inhabited during the Second Intermediate period (c. 1630–1540 bce), revealed a remarkable degree of town planning. Innumerable pieces of furniture and other household items were found, as well as a mass of papyri dealing with various topics, including letters, private wills, royal hymns, medical texts, and the temple archives of the pyramid cult. In 2009 excavations at Al-Lāhūn yielded a number of significant finds, including the body of a man identified by archaeologists as a senior government official. On the basis of engravings inscribed on its wooden coffin, the body was dated to the 2nd dynasty (c. 2775–c. 2650 bce), indicating that the site had been significant far earlier than previously thought.
