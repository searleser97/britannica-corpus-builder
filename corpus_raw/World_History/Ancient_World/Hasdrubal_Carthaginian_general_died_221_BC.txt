Hasdrubal,  (died 221 bc), Carthaginian general, the son-in-law of Hamilcar Barca.
Hasdrubal is known for his political opposition to the Carthaginian aristocracy and for the unusually wide support that he enjoyed from the city’s ordinary citizens. Hasdrubal assisted Hamilcar in successful campaigns of conquest against local tribes on the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain) from 237 bc until Hamilcar’s death during the winter of 229–228 bc. When he succeeded to the governorship, he made immediate policy changes, emphasizing the use of diplomatic rather than military methods for expanding Carthaginian Spain and dealing with Rome, most notably by marrying a Spanish princess. He founded New Carthage, a capital city that is today called Cartagena, and in 226–225 bc negotiated a treaty with the Romans that placed the northern limit of Carthaginian expansion at the Ebro River. Hasdrubal was murdered by a Celtic assassin in 221 bc.
