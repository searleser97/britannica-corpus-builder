Clactonian industry,  early flake tool tradition of Europe. Rather primitive tools were made by striking flakes from a flint core in alternating directions; used cores were later used as choppers. Flakes were trimmed and used as scrapers or knives. A kind of concave scraper, perhaps used to smooth and shape wooden spears, is typical of the Clactonian industry.
Clactonian tools are similar in appearance to those produced in the Soan industry of Pakistan and in several sites in eastern and southern Africa. The industry dates from the early part of the Mindel-Riss Interglacial Stage, or Great Interglacial (a major division of the Pleistocene Epoch; the Pleistocene occurred 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago), and is best known in England from the site of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, and the River Thames at Swanscombe, Kent. At the latter site the Clactonian industry underlies a well-developed (Middle) Acheulean industry. The significance of the distinctive nature of the Clactonian industry still is not fully understood. The Tayacian industry of France and Israel is believed to be a smaller edition of the Clactonian.
