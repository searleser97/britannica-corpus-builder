Appius Claudius Sabinus Inregillensis,  (flourished late 6th and early 5th centuries bc), traditional founder of the Claudii, one of the most distinguished gentes (“clans”) of ancient Rome. About 504 bc he migrated from Regillum (or Regilli) in Sabine territory to Rome, where he received patrician rank. His followers were granted Roman citizenship and land beyond the Anio (modern Aniene) River; this region formed the centre of the Claudian tribus, one of the rural tribes (a political division) that took their names from old patrician families.
