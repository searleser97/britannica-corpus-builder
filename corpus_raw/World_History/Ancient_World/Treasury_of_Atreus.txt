Treasury of Atreus, also called Tomb of Agamemnon,  a beehive, or tholos, tomb built about 1350 to 1250 bc at Mycenae, Greece. This surviving architectural structure of the Mycenaean civilization is a pointed dome built up of overhanging (i.e., corbeled) blocks of conglomerate masonry cut and polished to give the impression of a true vault. The diameter of the tomb is almost 50 feet (15 metres); its height is slightly less. The enormous monolithic lintel of the doorway weighs 120 tons and is 29.5 feet (9 metres) long, 16.5 feet (5 metres) deep, and 3 feet (0.9 metre) high. It is surmounted by a relieving triangle decorated with relief plaques.
A small side chamber hewn out of rock contained the burials, whereas the main chamber was probably reserved for ritual use. Two engaged columns of Minoan type (now in the British Museum, London), made of green limestone and decorated with a zigzag pattern, were secured to the facade, which was approached by a dromos, or ceremonial passageway, revetted with cyclopean blocks of masonry and open to the sky.
