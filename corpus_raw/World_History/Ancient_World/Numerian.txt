Numerian, Latin in full Marcus Aurelius Numerius Numerianus,  (died 284), Roman emperor 283–284.
He succeeded his father, Carus, in the summer of 283, in the midst of a war with the Sāsānians. Numerian was emperor in the East, and his brother, Carinus, ruled the West. Numerian led the army home but contracted a disabling eye disease. Late in 284, after the army had reached the Bosporus, Numerian was found dead. His father-in-law, Aper, who had assumed command, was accused of his murder and executed, and the throne passed to Diocletian, commander of the household guards.
