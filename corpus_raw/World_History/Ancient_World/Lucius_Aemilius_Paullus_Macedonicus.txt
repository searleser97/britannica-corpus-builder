Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, Paullus also spelled Paulus,  (born c. 229 bc—died 160), Roman general whose victory over the Macedonians at Pydna ended the Third Macedonian War (171–168 bc).
Paullus’s father, a consul of the same name, had been killed fighting the Carthaginians at Cannae in 216. Praetor in 191 and consul in 182, Paullus campaigned against the Lusitanians in Spain (191–189) and the Ingauni in Liguria (181). As consul again in 168, he decisively defeated the Macedonian king Perseus at Pydna (June 22). Paullus carried out the settlement with Macedonia and Greece, and, on orders from the Senate, he sacked the cities of Epirus. He was censor in 164.
From the ruins of the kingdom of Macedonia, he kept for himself only King Perseus’s library, believing fervently in the value of a Greek education. He had four sons. The two older he allowed to be adopted by noble families on the verge of extinction. The oldest became Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus. The second became Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, the future destroyer of Carthage. His two younger sons died in the year Aemilius Paullus celebrated his triumph over Macedon (167), in which King Perseus marched as a captive.
