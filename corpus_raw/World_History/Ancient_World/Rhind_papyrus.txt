Rhind papyrus,   ancient Egyptian scroll bearing mathematical tables and problems. This extensive document from ancient Egypt has been the source of much information about Egyptian mathematics. The papyrus was bought in 1858 in a Nile resort town by a Scottish antiquary, Alexander Henry Rhind, hence its name; less frequently, it is called the Ahmes papyrus in honour of the scribe who copied it about 1650 bc.
