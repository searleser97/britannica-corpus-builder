Smenkhkare,  (flourished 14th century bce), king (reigned 1335–32 bce) of the 18th dynasty (1539–1292 bce) of ancient Egypt, probably in coregency with Akhenaton, his predecessor, for most of the period. Smenkhkare’s origin and identity remain among the unresolved issues of the Amarna period.
The ephemeral Smenkhkare appears only at the very end of Ahkenaton’s reign in a few monuments at the royal capital of Akhetaton (Tell el-Amarna). He shares the same coronation name, Ankhkheperure, with another royal individual called Neferneferuaton (part of the expanded name of Nefertiti). Since coronation names are generally unique to one individual, it has been suggested that Smenkhkare is in fact Nefertiti herself, raised to kingly status to share the throne with her husband at the end of his life.
In one tomb at Akhetaton, Smenkhkare is shown with the eldest daughter of Akhenaton, Meritaton, then elevated to the status of queen; whether her new office represents an actual marriage or simply an honorary status conferred on her remains unclear. The only dated document of Smenkhkare’s reign is a graffito from a Theban tomb, which notes his third regnal year.
Cranial and serological analyses indicated that the mummy of a male discovered in tomb 55 (KV 55) of the Valley of the Kings has affinities close to those of Tutankhamen. Some scholars accepted the identification of the remains as Smenkhkare’s on the basis of fragmentary inscriptions in the tomb, concluding that Smenkhkare and Tutankhamen were brothers who succeeded Akhenaton in turn. However, other scholars suggested that the mummy might belong to Akhenaton himself. Subsequent tests run by Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities on a number of royal mummies indicated that the unidentified mummy from KV 55 was the father of Tutankhamen and the son of Amenhotep III, a lineage that matches that of Akhenaton.
