Gaohou, Wade-Giles romanization Kao-hou, also called Lühou, or Lüshi, personal name (xingming) Lü Zhi, or Lü Exu,  (died 180 bc, China), the first woman ruler of China, wife of Gaozu, the first emperor (reigned 206–195 bc) of the Han dynasty (206 bc–ad 220).
After Gaozu’s death, his and Gaohou’s young son, the emperor Huidi (reigned 195–188 bc), ascended the throne. Gaohou, whose ambition had spurred her husband’s rise to power, acted as regent and seized real power for herself. A cruel, vindictive woman, she consolidated her position by ignoring members of Gaozu’s family and promoting her own relatives to important posts.
Following Huidi’s death, Gaohou arranged for another infant to succeed him, but when the new young ruler began to assert his independence, she had him imprisoned and replaced with yet another child. However, after Gaohou’s death, her efforts on behalf of the Lü clan came to nothing; a coalition of high ministers and disgruntled princes of the imperial family massacred the entire clan. Gaohou was replaced by Liu Heng (Gaozu’s oldest living son by another wife), who ascended the throne as the Wendi emperor.
