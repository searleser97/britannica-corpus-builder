Ekron,   ancient Canaanite and Philistine city, one of the five cities of the Philistine pentapolis, and currently identified with Tel Miqne (Arabic: Khirbat al-Muqannaʿ), south of the settlement of Mazkeret Batya, central Israel. Although it was allocated to Judah after the Israelite conquest (Joshua 15:11), Ekron was a Philistine stronghold in David’s time (1 Samuel 17:52); during the time of King Ahaziah of Israel, it was associated with the worship of the deity Baalzebub (“Baal of the Flies”; though some would read instead Baal-zebul, or “Baal of the Abode”; 2 Kings 1:2–18). Taken by Egyptian Pharaoh Sheshonk I, the biblical Shishak, in the course of his conquest of Palestine (c. 918 bc), it was later tributary to Esarhaddon and his son Ashurbanipal, kings of Assyria (7th century bc). The city was known as Akkaron, or Accaron, in Hellenistic and later times, and the church historian Eusebius of Caesarea (fl. 4th century) mentions the existence of a Jewish population there during his lifetime.
By the late Middle Ages, Ekron had been abandoned; unlike other Philistine cities, such as Ashqelon, or Ashdod, no tell (or mound) bore its name throughout the centuries, though it survived in the Arab village of ʿAqir, which was first identified with Ekron by the 19th-century American biblical scholar Edward Robinson. In 1883 Baron Edmond de Rothschild founded a Jewish settlement adjoining ʿAqir, which he named Mazkeret Batya (Hebrew: “Memorial [to] Batya”), in honour of his mother; the name Ekron (now officially Qiryat ʿEqron) was subsequently given to an adjoining new immigrants’ settlement, established in 1949. However, the names ʿEqron and ʿAqir are still often used for the older settlement.
Another site suggested by some scholars for ancient Ekron is Qidron (Arabic: Qatra), 3 miles (5 km) south of Mazkeret Batya.
