Sayyid Zia od-Din Tabatabaʾi,  (born c. 1888—died  Aug. 29, 1969, Tehrān), Iranian statesman who led the coup d’état of 1921 in which he was made prime minister.
Tabatabaʾi became prominent during World War I as the editor of a pro-British newspaper, Raʾd (“Thunder”). In 1919 he led a quasi-diplomatic mission to negotiate a commercial agreement with the anti-Communist Russian revolutionaries at Baku. On his return to Iran he joined a secret nationalist society, Anjuman-i Fulad (“The Steel Committee”), created a coalition of anticommunist politicians, and masterminded the coup d’état of Feb. 21/22, 1921, that made him prime minister of Iran. Soon after assuming that office, he quarreled with the coup’s military leader, Colonel Reza Khan (who in 1925 became shāh of Iran), and in May was forced into exile.
Tabatabaʾi spent the next 20 years in Palestine; after the abdication of Reza Shah in September 1941, he returned to Iran. In 1942 he was elected to the Iranian Parliament, and in 1943 he founded the pro-British, anticommunist political party Iradah-yi milli (“The National Will”), which was active until 1951, at which time Tabatabaʾi faded from the political scene.
