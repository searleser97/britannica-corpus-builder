Sack of Rome,  (24 August 410). "Rome, once the capital of the world, is now the grave of the Roman people," wrote Saint Jerome of a cataclysm that no one could have predicted. After several generations of Roman superiority and arrogance, the Visigothic "barbarian" mercenaries reminded their erstwhile masters of where the real military power lay.
Alaric, leader of the Visigoths, had been left embittered by the experience at the Battle of Frigidus. For years he waged war on the Eastern Roman Empire; yet the Western Empire feared the Visigothsâ€™ anger, too-so much so that in 402 the Romans moved their capital from Rometo the more readily defensible Ravenna, in northeastern Italy. That same year, Alaric invaded Italy, but was turned back by the great general Flavius Stilicho at Pollentia in Piedmont. Another Gothic warlord, Radagaisus, was stopped by Stilicho in 406, but the Visigoths kept coming. By 408 Alaric was back in Italy, besieging Rome.
Even now, the Romans hoped to bring the tenacious Visigoths back into harness as defenders of the empire. Several barbarian peoples, from Germanic warriors such as the Vandals and Sueves to Asiatic nomads such as the Alans and the Huns, had crossed the Rhine and  now roamed and ransacked at will beyond the Alps.  Alaric was ready to compromise with Rome: he offered to spare the city in return for the promise of an annual payment and a place in the official military hierarchy of the empire. Yet, with Rome itself at stake, Emperor Honorius haughtily refused.
On the night of 24 August 410, rebel slaves, a suborned official, or some other unknown party quietly opened the gates of Rome to admit the Visigoths. They embarked on a three-day spree of plunder and destruction that left the Eternal City a smoking ruin.
Losses: Unknown.
