Apries, Hebrew Hophra,  (died 567 bce), fourth king (reigned 589–570 bce) of the 26th dynasty (664–525 bce; see ancient Egypt: The Late period [664–332 bce]) of ancient Egypt; he succeeded his father, Psamtik II.
Apries failed to help his ally King Zedekiah of Judah against the invading armies of Nebuchadrezzar II of Babylon, but after the fall of Jerusalem he received many Jewish refugees into Egypt. Later, according to Herodotus, he took the Phoenician port of Sidon, but, because of his subsequent failure in an attack on Cyrene in Libya, the Egyptian army mutinied and elected their general Amasis as king instead (570). Apries was imprisoned but escaped; he later was murdered, perhaps by Egyptians.
