Amratian culture, also called Naqādah I culture,  Egyptian Predynastic cultural phase, centred in Upper Egypt, its type-site being Al-ʿĀmirah near modern Abydos. Numerous sites, dating to about 3600 bce, have been excavated and reveal an agricultural way of life similar to that of the preceding Badarian culture but with advanced skills and techniques. Pottery characteristic of this period includes black-topped red ware and a dark-red burnished ware, occasionally decorated with bold linear designs in white slip depicting human or animal figures; on an Amratian shard excavated at Naqādah, the earliest known representation of the pharaonic red crown is drawn. Other important remains include disk-shaped mace heads, slate cosmetic palettes, well-made stone vases and ivory carvings, and numerous figurines of various materials.
