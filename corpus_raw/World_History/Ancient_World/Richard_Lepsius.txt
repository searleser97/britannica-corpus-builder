Richard Lepsius, in full Karl Richard Lepsius,  (born December 23, 1810, Naumburg an der Saale, Saxony [now in Germany]—died July 10, 1884, Berlin), German Egyptologist and a founder of modern, scientific archaeology who did much to catalog Egyptian archaeological remains and to establish a chronology for Egyptian history.
Following studies in archaeological philology and comparative languages, Lepsius became a lecturer at the University of Berlin. From 1843 to 1845, under the patronage of Frederick William IV of Prussia, he led a scientific expedition to Egypt and the Sudan. He found evidence of pyramids dating from about 3000 bc; studied 130 mastabas, the oblong burial structures peculiar to the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–c. 2160 bc); and, at Tell el-Amarna (ancient Akhetaton), found the first evidence to delineate the character of King Ikhnaton (Amenhotep IV), the controversial religious reformer. First to measure the Valley of the Kings, he also collected a great number of casts of temple reliefs and inscriptions, supervised the preparation of many drawings, and secured papyri and antiquities. Perhaps most important, he was the first to perceive the developing panorama of Egyptian history.
After returning to Prussia, he became professor at the University of Berlin (1846) and began publishing works that still attract interest, notably Chronologie der Ägypter (1849; “Egyptian Chronology”), Königsbuch der Alten Ägypter (1858; “Book of Egyptian Kings”), and the enormous Denkmäler aus Ägypten und Äthiopien, 12 vol. (1849–59; “Egyptian and Ethiopian Monuments”). In 1866 he returned to Egypt and discovered the Decree of Canopus, an inscription similar to the Rosetta Stone, which further substantiated the position of Egyptologist Jean-François Champollion on the deciphering of hieroglyphs. Under Lepsius’s direction, the Egyptian collection of the Berlin Museum became one of the world’s finest. In 1873 he also became director of the Royal Library, Berlin.
