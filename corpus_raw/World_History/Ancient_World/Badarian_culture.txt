Badarian culture,  Egyptian predynastic cultural phase, first discovered at Al-Badārī, its type site, on the east bank of the Nile River in Asyūṭ muḥāfaẓah (governorate), Upper Egypt. British excavations there during the 1920s revealed cemeteries dating to about 4000 bce.
Although the Badarians apparently continued the agricultural and pastoral practices of the earlier proto-Nilotic cultures that immediately preceded them, their artistic and technical skills were greatly improved. Their pottery, often distinguished by a black top, was extremely thin-walled and well-fired; many regard it as the best ever made in the Nile River valley. Other remains include combs and spoons of ivory, geometric slate palettes, female figurines, and copper and stone beads.
Badarian materials have also been found at Jazīrat Armant, Al-Ḥammāmiyyah, Hierakonpolis (modern Kawm al-Aḥmar), Al-Maṭmār, and Tall al-Kawm al-Kabīr.
