Quintus Aurelius Memmius Symmachus,  (died 524, Pavia, Liguria), Roman senator and patrician and a close friend of the philosopher Boethius, who married Symmachus’ daughter Rusticiana and with whom he was executed for treason by the Ostrogoth king Theodoric.
Consul in 485, Symmachus was, like his son-in-law, an official of Theodoric’s government. When Boethius defended the senator Albinus against an accusation of treason and was himself similarly charged, Symmachus defended Boethius. Symmachus in turn was arrested and, with Boethius, was executed.
