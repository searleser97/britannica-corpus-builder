Shabaka, also called Sabacon,  (flourished 8th century bce), Kushite king who conquered Egypt and founded its 25th (Kushite) dynasty (see ancient Egypt: The 24th and 25th dynasties). He ruled Egypt from about 719/718 to 703 bce.
Succeeding his brother Piye, in Kush (in modern Sudan), Shabaka moved north, captured Bocchoris, the second king of the 24th dynasty, and, according to tradition, burned him alive. He probably made Memphis, near Cairo, his capital and adopted the titles of the traditional Egyptian pharaohs. He contributed numerous religious buildings at Thebes, home of Amon-Re, his dynastic god.
Following Piye’s ideals, Shabaka fostered religious orthodoxy in Amon’s cult and a return to ancient cultural themes, which characterized the 25th and 26th dynasties. He had old texts recopied and also continued the royal tradition of pyramid burials. He was interred in a pyramid at Mount Barkal, his dynastic home between the Third and Fourth cataracts of the Nile River.
