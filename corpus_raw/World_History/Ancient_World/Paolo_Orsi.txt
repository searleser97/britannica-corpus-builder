Paolo Orsi,  (born Oct. 18, 1859, Rovereto, Austria—died  Nov. 9, 1935, Rovereto), archaeologist who pioneered in the excavation and research of sites, from the prehistoric to the Byzantine, in Sicily and southern Italy.
A large part of present knowledge of Sicilian art and civilization, especially in the Siculan (pre-Greek) period, is the result of Orsi’s work. Appointed director of the museum at Syracuse, Sicily, in 1888, he devoted himself to explorations, discovering the Siculan culture from excavations of cemeteries all over the island and laying the groundwork for the chronology of its four periods. His meticulous excavations of Greek cities throughout Sicily and in the southern Italian provinces of Magna Graecia uncovered many new sites and extended known sites, including Syracuse and Gela in Sicily and Croton and Locri Epizephyrii on the mainland. He organized his finds in the museums of Syracuse and Reggio di Calabria and published 300 titles. He also edited Bullettino di paletnologia italiana and Archivio storico della Calabria e Lucania.
