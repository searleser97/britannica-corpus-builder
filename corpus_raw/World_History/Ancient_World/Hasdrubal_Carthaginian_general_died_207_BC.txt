Hasdrubal,  (died 207 bc), Carthaginian general who unsuccessfully attempted to sustain military ascendancy on the Spanish peninsula in the face of Roman attacks.
Hasdrubal, the second son of Hamilcar Barca, was left in command of Spain when his brother Hannibal went to Italy (218 bc), and he fought for seven years against Publius Cornelius Scipio and his brother Gnaeus. The war began poorly for Hasdrubal. In a naval battle during the early summer of 217 bc on the Ebro River at Tarraco, Hasdrubal’s fleet was largely destroyed by a daring surprise Roman attack.
In 215 bc Hasdrubal battled the Scipios at Dertosa, a city on the banks of the Ebro. The Carthaginian forces took very heavy losses in that battle when their centre broke. Four years later, Hasdrubal struck back, crushing the Roman armies, killing the Scipio brothers, and driving the Romans from most of Spain south of the Ebro. The younger Publius Cornelius Scipio, who was only 25, was then given command of the Roman armies in Spain. He arrived in 210 and in a daring attack seized the key Carthaginian base at New Carthage (now Cartagena). In 208 Scipio defeated Hasdrubal at Baecula (now Bailen), but Hasdrubal escaped with most of his army and marched to Italy in an attempt to join Hannibal. He was ultimately defeated in 207 at the Metaurus River, his head being thrown into Hannibal’s camp by order of the Roman general Gaius Claudius Nero.
