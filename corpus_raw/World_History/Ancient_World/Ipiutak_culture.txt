Ipiutak culture,   Eskimo culture of northwestern Alaska, probably dating from the 2nd to the 6th century ad. A Siberian origin has been suggested, based on similarities in burial practices and ceremonialism, animal carvings and designs, and some use of iron; but evidence is not conclusive. There seem to be links with the Kachemak culture (q.v.) as well as with some areas of southwestern and western Alaska.
The Ipiutak people may have inhabited the coastal region only in the spring and summer months, moving inland for the rest of the year. Coastal dwellings were semi-subterranean huts. Seals and walrus were a major source of food and were hunted with harpoons from the edge of the ice. Bows and arrows were preferred for hunting caribou. Fish and birds were a minor part of the diet.
A distinctive feature of Ipiutak tools was the use of flint rather than rubbed slate. The abundant flint of Point Hope was used for weapon points, knives, and scrapers. Ipiutak artifacts show more decoration than those of any other Eskimo culture; both geometric and realistic designs were used. Their sculpture, carvings in ivory and antler of real or imaginary animals, was finely crafted.
Elaborate burial customs, a ghost and a bear cult, and shamanism are suggested.
Ipiutak culture lacked a number of elements of typical Eskimo culture, such as stone or clay lamps and cooking pots, harpoon floats, bow drills, and slate implements.
