Pulcheria,  (born Jan. 19, 399, Constantinople [now Istanbul, Tur.]—died  453), Roman empress, regent for her younger brother Theodosius II (Eastern Roman emperor 408–450) from 414 to about 416, and an influential figure in his reign for many years thereafter.
Pulcheria’s parents were the Eastern Roman emperor Flavius Arcadius (reigned 383–408) and his wife, Eudoxia. Pulcheria assumed the regency upon her appointment as augusta (empress) on July 4, 414, and the court she ruled was characterized by extreme piety and chastity. In 421 she arranged the marriage of Theodosius with Athenais, who assumed the name Eudocia. But the two women quarreled about 440, and Eudocia in 443 withdrew permanently to Jerusalem. The grand chamberlain Chrysaphius then acquired the dominant influence over Theodosius. When this adviser fell from power shortly before Theodosius’ death (in July 450), Pulcheria again came into prominence. She selected Marcian as Theodosius’ successor and agreed to become his nominal wife in order to preserve the Theodosian dynasty.
Throughout her life Pulcheria remained a devout Christian. On Oct. 25, 451, she attended the Council of Chalcedon and was loudly acclaimed by the bishops assembled there. She built several churches in Constantinople and left all her possessions to the poor.
