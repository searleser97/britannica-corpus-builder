John Garstang,  (born May 5, 1876, Blackburn, Lancashire, Eng.—died  Sept. 12, 1956, Beirut, Lebanon), English archaeologist who made major contributions to the study of the ancient history and prehistory of Asia Minor and Palestine.
Best known for his excavation of Jericho (1930–36), Garstang entered the field of archaeology by excavating Roman remains in Britain, notably at Ribchester, Lancashire. For about 40 years he successfully combined fieldwork with an academic career. He became a lecturer in Egyptian archaeology at the University of Liverpool (1902), where he served as professor of methods and practice of archaeology from 1907 to 1941.
His work in Egypt, first at Abydos with the famed English archaeologist Flinders Petrie (1900), continued through 1908 and included excavation of a number of sites. During a visit to the excavation of the Hittite capital at Hattusas (now Boğazköy, Turkey), he witnessed the discovery of the Hittite royal archives, and a major aspect of his career thus was launched. While carrying out research in northern Syria and Anatolia, he decided to excavate a mound near Sakcagöz, Turkey. Between 1907 and 1911 a wealth of discoveries were made there, from architectural remains and sculpture of the late Hittite period to Neolithic pottery and implements of the 5th and 4th millennia bc. In 1910 he published The Land of the Hittites. From 1909 to 1914 he directed much attention to the northern Sudan, excavating ancient Meroe and the nearby temple of the sun, analyzing this work in Meroë: The City of the Ethiopians (1911).
Garstang became the first director of the British School of Archaeology in Palestine in 1919, where he developed plans for systematic archaeological surveys. He studied a number of sites, including that of Ascalon (present-day Ashqelon), near Gaza, where he found evidence of habitation dating back to 2000 bc. His excavation of places associated with the passing of the Israelites into Canaan aroused considerable interest and support. In 1926, near the Sea of Galilee, he identified Hazor of the Bible. From 1930 to 1936 he worked at Jericho and made the first soundings to reach very early strata that antedated the use of pottery. Though he related some fallen city walls to Joshua’s conquest, later research indicated that they date from three centuries earlier. Nevertheless, his book The Foundations of Bible History: Joshua, Judges (1931) remains a valuable source of information.
In 1937 he again turned his attention to the land of the Hittites. Choosing Yümük Tepesi, near Mersin, Turkey, as his site, he found many valuable prehistoric remains. He became director of the British Institute of Archaeology in Turkey (1947) and published the results of his last major effort in Prehistoric Mersin (1953).
