Wendi, Wade-Giles romanization  Wen-ti, personal name (xingming) Liu Heng, temple name (miaohao) Taizong,  (born 203, China—died 157 bc, China), posthumous name (shi) of the fourth emperor (reigned 180–157 bc) of the Han dynasty (206 bc–ad 220) of China. His reign was marked by good government and the peaceful consolidation of imperial power.
A son of Liu Bang (the Gaozu emperor), the founder of the Han dynasty, Liu Heng was the prince of Dai when he was chosen emperor over several other contenders for the imperial throne. His reign of 23 years made him the first Han emperor to rule for such a long period of time and gave the dynasty a stability it had hitherto lacked. The Wendi emperor further weakened the power of local dukes and other vassals in the process of consolidating the central government’s authority. At the same time, he was credited with the ideal behaviour of a monarch; he listened to his subordinates’ advice and sought their agreement in important decisions. Wendi’s legendary frugality enabled him to lighten the tax burdens on the peasantry. He also took measures to improve irrigation and otherwise promote agricultural production. Under his rule China’s economy prospered and its population expanded. The continuity of Han rule was assured when, at Wendi’s death, the throne passed peacefully to his son, Liu Qi (the Jingdi emperor), whose reign was also known for its good government. To later ages, Wendi epitomized the virtues of frugality and benevolence in a Chinese ruler.
