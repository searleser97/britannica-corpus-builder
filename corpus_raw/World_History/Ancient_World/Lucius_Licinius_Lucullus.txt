Lucius Licinius Lucullus,  (born c. 117 bc—died  57/56), Roman general who fought Mithradates VI Eupator of Pontus from 74 to 66 bc.
He served in the Social War (91–87) under Lucius Cornelius Sulla. As quaestor in 88, he was the only one of Sulla’s officers to take part in his march on Rome. He was Sulla’s proquaestor in the East from 87 until his return to Italy and was indispensable in the success of Sulla’s campaign against Mithradates VI, king of Pontus. He was aedile in 79 and (by special dispensation) praetor in 78.
In 74, when Lucullus was consul, the Roman province of Bithynia was invaded by Mithradates VI. Lucullus was appointed governor of Cilicia and later of Asia and commanded Roman forces in the war against Mithradates. With five legions he drove his opponent from Cyzicus in the winter of 74–73 and defeated him at Cabira in 72. By 70 the war seemed to be over. Lucullus’s able financial administration alleviated the crisis caused by the war in the province of Asia by drawing up a plan that allowed the cities of Asia to pay off their debts to Roman businessmen at moderate rates. His evenhanded treatment of Asian debtors and Roman creditors earned him the hatred of the latter.
Mithradates then gained the alliance of his son-in-law, Tigranes, king of Armenia. Lucullus attacked Armenia, defeated Tigranes, and captured his capital, Tigranocerta, in 69. Three mutinies by Lucullus’s troops in 68–67, however, forced him to curtail operations. Mithradates recovered much of his lost territory, and Lucullus’s enemies carried legislation (Lex Manilia) requiring him to hand over his command to Gnaeus Pompey.
Lucullus was prevented from celebrating his triumph at Rome until 63. In 59 he opposed the political maneuvers of Caesar, Pompey, and Marcus Licinius Crassus (called by modern scholars the First Triumvirate). Afterward he retired to enjoy a life of great extravagance. The adjective Lucullan, meaning “luxurious,” derives from his name.
