Sir Alexander Cunningham,  (born Jan. 23, 1814, London, Eng.—died Nov. 28, 1893, London), British army officer and archaeologist who excavated many sites in India, including Sārnāth and Sānchi, and served as the first director of the Indian Archaeological Survey.
At age 19 he joined the Bengal Engineers and spent 28 years in the British service in India, retiring as major general in 1861. Early in his career he met James Prinsep, a British numismatist and Indian scholar, who ignited his interest in Indian history and coins. In 1837 Cunningham excavated at Sārnāth, outside Vārānasi (Benares), one of the most sacred Buddhist shrines, and carefully prepared drawings of the sculptures. In 1850 he excavated Sānchi, site of some of the oldest surviving buildings in India. In addition to a study of the temple architecture of Kāshmir (1848) and a work on Ladākh (1854), he published The Bhilsa Topes (1854), the first serious attempt to trace Buddhist history through its architectural remains.
In 1861 he agreed to become director of the Indian Archaeological Survey and remained with it until it was dissolved (1865). He resumed his post when the survey was restored (1870) and during the next 15 years carried out many archaeological explorations among the ruins of northern India. He published The Ancient Geography of India (1871), the first collection of the edicts of the 3rd-century-bc Indian emperor Aśoka, and The Stûpa of Bharhut (1879). Over the years he gathered a large collection of Indian coins, the choicest of which were purchased by the British Museum. After his retirement from the survey (1885), he devoted himself to Indian numismatics and wrote two books on the subject. He was knighted in 1887.
