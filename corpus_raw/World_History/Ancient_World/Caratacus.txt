Caratacus, also spelled Caractacus, Celtic Caradoc,  (flourished 1st century ce), king of a large area in southern Britain, son of Cunobelinus.
Caratacus was from the Catuvellauni tribe, but his kingdom included other peoples, most notably the Trinovantes. He ruled an area that embraced the Atrebates of Hampshire and probably the Dobunni of Gloucestershire. At the time of the Roman invasion of Britain during the reign of Claudius, he led the native resistance against Aulus Plautius (43â€“47 ce) and, after being defeated, withdrew into south Wales. He was finally defeated by Ostorius Scapula in 50 ce, somewhere on the Welsh marches, in the territory of the Ordovices. He himself fled to the Brigantes, whose queen, Cartimandua, delivered him to the Romans. He and his family were featured in a victory parade of Claudius, who granted them pardon and life.
