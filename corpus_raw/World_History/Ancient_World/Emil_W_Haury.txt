Emil W. Haury, in full Emil Walter Haury,  (born May 2, 1904, Newton, Kan., U.S.—died  Dec. 5, 1992, Tucson, Ariz.), American anthropologist and archaeologist who investigated the ancient Indian civilizations of the southwestern United States and South America. His main concerns were the preceramic and ceramic archaeology of the southwestern United States and Mexico; the archaeology of the Hohokam, Mogollon, and Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) Indians of the southwestern United States; and the archaeology of the Chibcha Indians of the northern Andes.
Haury received his B.A. and M.A. from the University of Arizona and his Ph.D. from Harvard University (1934). He had been an instructor at the University of Arizona before going to Harvard, and afterward he returned to Arizona (1937) to become a professor of anthropology and eventually the head of the department (emeritus 1980). Haury was director of the university’s Arizona State Museum from 1938 to 1964.
Some of Haury’s works are The Stratigraphy and Archaeology of Ventana Cave (1950), Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the New World (1956), and The Hohokam, Desert Farmers and Craftsmen: Excavations at Snaketown, 1964–1965 (1976).
