Shāpūr I, Latin Sapor,  Arabic Sābūr,  (died ad 272), Persian king of the Sāsānian dynasty who consolidated and expanded the empire founded by his father, Ardashīr I. Shāpūr continued his father’s wars with Rome, conquering Nisibis (modern Nusaybin, Tur.) and Carrhae (Harran, Tur.) and advancing deep into Syria. Defeated at Resaina (now in Turkey) in 243, he was able, nevertheless, to conclude a favourable peace in 244. In 256 he took advantage of the internal chaos within the Roman Empire and invaded Syria, Anatolia, and Armenia; he sacked Antioch but was repulsed by the emperor Valerian. In 260, however, Shāpūr not only defeated Valerian at Edessa (modern Urfa, Tur.) but captured him and kept him a prisoner for the rest of his life. The capture of Valerian was a favourite subject of Sāsānian rock carvings (see photograph). Shāpūr does not appear to have aimed at a permanent occupation of the eastern Roman provinces; he merely carried off enormous booty both in treasure and in men. The captives from Antioch were forced to build the city of Gondēshāpūr, later famous as a centre of learning. Using the same captives, who excelled the Persians in technical skill, he built the dam at Shūshtar known from that time as the Band-e Qeyṣar, Dam of Caesar.
Shāpūr, no longer content to describe himself as “king of kings of Iran,” as his father had done, styled himself “king of kings of Iran and non-Iran”—that is, of non-Persian territories as well. He appears to have tried to find a religion suitable for all of the empire, showing marked favour to Mani, the founder of Manichaeism. Inscriptions show that he also founded Zoroastrian fire temples and sought to broaden the base of the newly revived Zoroastrian religion by the addition of material derived from both Greek and Indian sources.
