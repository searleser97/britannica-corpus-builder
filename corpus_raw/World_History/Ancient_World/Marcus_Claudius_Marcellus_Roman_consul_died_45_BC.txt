Marcus Claudius Marcellus,  (died May 45 bc), leading Optimate (conservative senator) and an uncompromising opponent of Julius Caesar. As consul, Marcellus attempted to remove Caesar from his army command on March 1, 50, but he was outmaneuvered by the pro-Caesarian tribune Gaius Scribonius Curio. During the Civil War (Caesar against Pompey the Great and the majority of the Senate, 49–45) Marcellus followed Pompey to Greece; after Pompey’s defeat at Pharsalus in 48 he retired to Mytilene, where he practiced rhetoric and studied philosophy. In 46 the Senate successfully appealed to Caesar to pardon Marcellus. It was to celebrate the pardon that Cicero delivered his speech Pro Marcello. Marcellus left for Italy but was murdered in Piraeus, Achaea, by one of his own attendants. The rumours that Caesar had engineered the assassination were not believed by Cicero (Letters to Atticus).
