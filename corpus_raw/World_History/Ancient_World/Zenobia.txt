Zenobia, in full Septimia Zenobia, Aramaic Znwbyā Bat Zabbai,  (died after 274), queen of the Roman colony of Palmyra, in present-day Syria, from 267 or 268 to 272. She conquered several of Rome’s eastern provinces before she was subjugated by the emperor Aurelian (ruled 270–275).
Zenobia’s husband, Odaenathus, Rome’s client ruler of Palmyra, had by 267 recovered the Roman East from Persian conquerors. After Odaenathus and his eldest son (by his former wife), Herodes (or Herodianus), were assassinated in 267 or 268, Zenobia became regent for her own young son Wahballat (called Vaballathus in Latin, Athenodorus in Greek). Styling herself queen of Palmyra, she had Vaballathus adopt his father’s titles of “king of kings” and corrector totius Orientis (“governor of all the East”).
Nevertheless, unlike Odaenathus, Zenobia was not content to remain a Roman client. In 269 she seized Egypt, then conquered much of Asia Minor and declared her independence from Rome. Marching east, Aurelian defeated her armies at Antioch (now Antakya, Turkey) and at Emesa (now Ḥimṣ, Syria) and besieged Palmyra. Zenobia and Vaballathus tried to flee from the city, but they were captured before they could cross the Euphrates River, and the Palmyrenes soon surrendered. When they revolted again in 273, the Romans recaptured and destroyed the city. Sources differ about Zenobia’s fate after her capture. According to some, Zenobia and Vaballathus graced the triumphal procession that Aurelian celebrated at Rome in 274. However, other historians claim that she starved herself to death during the trip to Rome.
