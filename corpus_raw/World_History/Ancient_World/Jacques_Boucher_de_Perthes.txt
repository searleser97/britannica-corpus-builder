Jacques Boucher de Perthes, in full Jacques Boucher de Crèvecoeur de Perthes,  (born Sept. 10, 1788, Rethel, France—died  Aug. 5, 1868, Abbeville), French archaeologist and writer who was one of the first to develop the idea that prehistory could be measured on the basis of periods of geologic time.
From 1825 Boucher de Perthes was director of the customhouse at Abbeville, near the mouth of the Somme River, and began devoting his leisure to archaeological searches in the Somme valley. In 1837 he discovered flint hand axes and other stone tools, some embedded with the bones of extinct mammals in gravels deposited during the Pleistocene Epoch, or Ice Age (concluded about 11,700 years ago).
Though not the first to find evidence of Stone Age culture, Boucher de Perthes was the first to draw the attention of the scientific world to its revolutionary significance, because 4004 bce was then thought to be the year of the Creation described in the Bible. In 1838 the tools he presented in evidence before the scientific society of Abbeville met with disbelief, and his monograph on primitive toolmaking (1846) was ignored. At first he thought that the hand axes were made at the time of the Deluge described in Genesis, but he subsequently concluded that even if the gravels had resulted from but one deluge, the creators of the tools (“Antediluvian Man”) must have existed prior to it.
In 1859, the year that Darwin’s Origin of Species was published, Boucher de Perthes’s conclusions were at last upheld by a group of eminent British scientists, including Charles Lyell, who visited the excavated sites. His archaeological writings include Antiquités celtiques et antédiluviennes, 3 vol. (1847–64).
