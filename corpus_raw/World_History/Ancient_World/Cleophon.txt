Cleophon,   (died 404 bc), Athenian statesman, one of the dominant figures in Athenian politics until the end of the Peloponnesian War, who came to power in 410. He led the people to reject Spartan peace offers after the Athenian victory at Cyzicus (410) and again after Arginusae (406), as his political predecessor Cleon had rejected similar offers in 425. Even after the decisive defeat of the Athenians at Aegospotami, when the Spartans blockaded Athens, Cleophon continued to urge resistance, but the situation became desperate and he was arrested and condemned to death in 404.
