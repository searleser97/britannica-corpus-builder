Alaric II,  (died 507), king of the Visigoths, who succeeded his father Euric on Dec. 28, 484. He was married to Theodegotha, daughter of Theodoric, the Ostrogothic king of Italy.
His dominions comprised Aquitaine, Languedoc, Roussillon, and parts of western Spain. Alaric, like his father, was an Arian Christian, but he mitigated the persecution of Catholics and authorized the Catholic council at Agde in 506. To provide a law code for his Roman subjects, he appointed a commission to prepare an abstract of Roman laws and imperial decrees. This influential code, issued in 506, is generally known as the Lex Romana Visigothorum, or Breviary of Alaric.
Alaric tried to maintain his father’s treaty with the Franks, but Clovis, the Frankish king, made the Visigoths’ Arianism a pretext for war. In 507 the Visigoths were defeated in the battle of the Campus Vogladensis (Vouillé, in Poitou).
