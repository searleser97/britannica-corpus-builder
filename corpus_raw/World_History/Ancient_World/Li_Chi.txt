Li Chi, Pinyin Li Ji, courtesy name (zi) Jizhi,  (born July 12, 1896, Zhongxiang, Hubei province, China—died August 1, 1979, Taipei, Taiwan), archaeologist chiefly responsible for establishing the historical authenticity of the semilegendary Shang dynasty of China. The exact dates of the Shang dynasty are uncertain; traditionally, they have been given as from c. 1766 to c. 1122 bce, but more recent archaeological evidence has revised the range to between c. 1600 and 1046 bce.
One of many Chinese students sent to colleges and universities in the West in the early 20th century, Li studied anthropology and received a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1923. After being associated briefly with the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., he returned to China and taught for a short time. In 1928 he became the director of archaeology for the Academia Sinica, the Chinese national research organization.
That same year, he made a preliminary sounding of the ancient Shang capital at Anyang, Henan province, and, in 1929, under the patronage of the Academia Sinica and the Freer Gallery, he began an organized excavation of the site that continued intermittently from 1929 to 1937. The harsh climate permitted only brief digging seasons, and several factors—including traditional Chinese opposition to any disturbance of the earth, civil war in 1930, large-scale grave looting, and threats by organized bandits—militated against his archaeological efforts. During the final seasons of work, with an armed guard and the official protection of Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi), great progress was made. More than 300 tombs, including 4 important royal burial sites, were uncovered and carefully studied. Some 1,100 skeletons and animal bones inscribed with oracles in an early Chinese script, unquestionably linked with the Shang period, were recovered.
After the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and the expulsion of the Chinese Nationalists from the mainland in 1949, many of Li’s Anyang remains and notes were lost. After escaping to Taiwan, he became the head of anthropology and archaeology at the National University in Taipei (1950) and began directing publication of his remaining Anyang materials. He published a number of books, including The Beginnings of Chinese Civilization (1957) and Anyang (1977).
