Dorothy Annie Elizabeth Garrod,  (born May 5, 1892, London, Eng.—died  Dec. 18, 1968, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), English archaeologist who directed excavations at Mount Carmel, Palestine (1929–34), uncovering skeletal remains of primary importance to the study of human evolution.
Garrod carried out Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, research in Gibraltar (1925–26) and in southern Kurdistan (1928). From 1929 to 1934 she led joint British and American efforts at Mount Carmel that brought to light the first evidence of Paleolithic and Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age, cultures in Palestine. During 1931–32 some dozen skeletal remains were found in a cave and rock shelter, including, from the cave, a complete female skeleton now known to be about 41,000 years old. The remains from the rock shelter are about 5,000 years younger. Some authorities believe that these remains represent an intermediate stage between Neanderthal man and modern man. Findings were published in The Stone Age of Mount Carmel, 2 vol. (1937–39). She turned to Stone Age studies in Bulgaria in 1938. A leading authority on the Paleolithic for many years, Garrod was the first woman to receive a professorship at the University of Cambridge, serving as professor of archaeology from 1939 to 1952. She conducted research in southern Lebanon in 1958.
