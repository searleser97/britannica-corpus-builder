Anne-Claude-Philippe de Tubières, count de Caylus,  (born October 31, 1692, Paris—died September 5, 1765, Paris), French archaeologist, engraver, and man of letters.
The only son of the Marquise de Caylus, he fought with distinction in the War of the Spanish Succession (1704–14). After the war he resigned his commission to travel to Italy, then to Constantinople and Greece, and later in the Netherlands and England. Returning to Paris, he devoted his life to engraving and archaeology, winning election to both the Académie de Peinture et Sculpture and the Académie des Inscriptions. His principal work is Recueil d’antiquités égyptiennes, étrusques, grecques, romaines, et gauloises, 7 vol. (1752–67?; “Collection of Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Roman, and Gallic Antiquities”).
