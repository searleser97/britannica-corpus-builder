George Edward Stanhope Molyneux Herbert, 5th earl of Carnarvon,  (born June 26, 1866, Highclere Castle, Berkshire, Eng.—died April 5, 1923, Cairo), British Egyptologist who was the patron and associate of archaeologist Howard Carter in the discovery of the tomb of King Tutankhamen.
Carnarvon was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He began excavations in Thebes in 1906, but, as an amateur, he soon felt the need of expert advice and sought the help of Carter, a former official of the Egyptian government’s antiquities department. Their collaboration began in 1907, when Carter agreed to supervise excavations for Carnarvon. They published an account of their work, which included discoveries of tombs of the 12th and 18th dynasties, in 1912: Five Years’ Exploration at Thebes.
Excavations resumed after World War I, and on Nov. 4, 1922, Carter unearthed the tomb of Tutankhamen in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings. On Feb. 16–17, 1923, the sepulchral chamber was opened, the actual sarcophagus being discovered on Jan. 3, 1924. Carnarvon died in a Cairo hospital from infections and complications that arose after he was bitten by a mosquito while in Thebes to visit the just-opened burial chamber of the tomb.
