Tower of Hercules,  probably the only ancient Roman lighthouse still in use. The tower stands at the entrance of A Coruña harbour in the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain. A Phoenician tower may have occupied the site originally, but the present structure, 185 feet (56.8 metres) tall, is considered a Roman work dating from or at least remodeled during the reign of Trajan (98–117 ce). It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2009.
