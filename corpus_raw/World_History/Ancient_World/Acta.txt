Acta, (Latin:  “things that have been done”)  in ancient Rome, minutes of official business (Acta senatus) and a gazette of political and social events (Acta diurna).
The Acta senatus, or Commentarii senatus, were the minutes of the proceedings of the Senate, and, according to Suetonius, they were first published in 59 bce. They were available to senators, but the emperor Augustus did not allow access to the wider public. From the reign of his successor, Tiberius, in the 1st century ce, a young senator drew up the Acta senatus, which were kept in the imperial archives and public libraries. They could be examined only with special permission.
The Acta diurna (also called Acta populi, or Acta publica), said to date from before 59 bce, recorded official business and matters of public interest. Under the empire (after 27 bce), the Acta diurna constituted a type of daily gazette, and thus it was, in a sense, the prototype of the modern newspaper.
Somewhat confusingly, the term acta, used by itself, generally designates an emperor’s official enactments. Upon taking office, senators and other officials swore to uphold the emperor’s acta.
