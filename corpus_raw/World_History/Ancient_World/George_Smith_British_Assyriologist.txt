George Smith,  (born March 26, 1840, London, Eng.—died  Aug. 19, 1876, Aleppo, Syria), English Assyriologist who advanced knowledge of the earliest (Sumerian) period of Mesopotamian civilization with his discovery of one of the most important literary works in Akkadian, the Epic of Gilgamesh. Moreover, its description of a flood, strikingly similar to the account in Genesis, had a stunning effect on Smith’s generation.
Apprenticed as a bank note engraver at the age of 14, Smith educated himself in the young science of Assyriology and became adept in deciphering the cuneiform tablets from Nineveh that began arriving at the British Museum, London, about 1861. His publication of several essays on cuneiform characters of uncertain meaning attracted attention, and soon he became an assistant in the museum’s department of Oriental antiquities.
While preparing inscriptions for publication, he was startled to find part of a description of a flood. His report of this discovery prompted The Daily Telegraph of London to sponsor an expedition to find the missing fragment needed to complete the deluge account. In May 1873, on the fifth day of digging at Nineveh, Smith found the fragment. His Chaldean Account of Genesis (1876) became one of the best-selling books of its time.
