Gildo,   (died 398, Thabraca), Moorish potentate who rebelled against Rome in 397–398.
In 375 Gildo helped the Romans crush his brother Firmus, who was attempting to carve out an independent kingdom from a portion of Rome’s African provinces. As a reward, the Romans appointed him count of Africa and master of the soldiers. But he refused to help the emperor Theodosius I (ruled 379–395) in his struggle against the usurping emperor Eugenius, and, two years after Theodosius’ death, Gildo revolted against Rome. He prevented ships from sailing from Africa to Italy with Rome’s all-important grain supply. The senate declared Gildo a public enemy and in the spring of 398 sent a force to Africa under the command of his brother Mascezel. Little effort was required to crush the rebellion; Mascezel advanced and, between Theveste (modern Tébessa, Alg.) and Ammaedara (modern Haïdra, Tunisia), Gildo’s 70,000-man army melted away. Gildo tried to escape by sea but he was driven ashore at Thabraca and executed.
Events in the war against Gildo are recounted in a poem entitled “The Gildonic War” by Claudian (c. 370–c. 404).
