Caulonia,   ancient Greek city in southern Italy, southernmost of the colonies founded in Italy by the Achaeans. Established perhaps in the first half of the 7th century bc, Caulonia was an outpost of Croton. Judging from its copious and beautiful coinage from the second half of the 6th century, it seems to have been of some importance despite its small size. After capture by Campanian troops during the invasion (280–275) by Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, and then submission to Hannibal in 215, the city withstood a siege (209) on Hannibal’s side in the Second Punic War, but its fortunes declined soon after.
Excavations at the site, located on the eastern coast of modern Calabria, nine miles from modern Caulonia, have revealed remains of fortifications with towers of the Hellenistic period, a large Doric temple, a small temple, and terra-cotta fragments of architectural structures.
