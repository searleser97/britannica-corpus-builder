Henri Frankfort,  (born Feb. 24, 1897, Amsterdam, Neth.—died  July 16, 1954, London, Eng.), American archaeologist who completed a well-documented reconstruction of ancient Mesopotamian culture, established the relation between Egypt and Mesopotamia, and discovered much new information on both civilizations.
Frankfort’s university studies in history, hieroglyphics, and archaeology were complemented by excavations in Egypt (1922) and travel through the Balkans and the Middle East (1922, 1924–25). From this period he produced Studies in Early Pottery of the Near East, 2 vol. (1924–27). After directing excavations in Egypt at Abydos, Tell el-Amarna, and Armant (1925–29), he led the expedition of the Oriental Institute (University of Chicago) to Iraq (1929–37) and published Cylinder Seals: A Documentary Essay on the Art and Religion of the Ancient Near East (1939).
As professor at the University of Chicago and head of the Warburg Institute of the University of London (1938–54), he brought his far-reaching interests to bear on comparative studies of Egypt and Mesopotamia. He approached archaeological materials with a keen regard for anthropological, aesthetic, and philosophical problems as well as a rare understanding of religious phenomena. His other works include Kingship and the Gods: A Study of Ancient Near Eastern Religion as the Integration of Society and Nature (1948), Ancient Egyptian Religion: An Interpretation (1948), and The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient (1954).
