Marcus Atilius Regulus,  (flourished  3rd century bc), Roman general and statesman whose career, greatly embellished by legend, was seen by the Romans as a model of heroic endurance.
Regulus served as consul in 267 and 256. In the latter year (during the First Punic War, 264–241) he and his colleague Lucius Manlius Vulso defeated the Carthaginian fleet off Mount Ecnomus, in southeast Sicily, and landed an army in Africa. Vulso was then recalled, leaving Regulus to finish the war. Regulus severely defeated the enemy at Adys, near Carthage. His demands for an unconditional surrender, however, angered the Carthaginians, who in turn resolved to continue the struggle, and in 255 they defeated and seized the Roman general.
According to tradition, Regulus remained in captivity at Carthage until he was sent to Rome on parole to negotiate either a peace or an exchange of prisoners. He is supposed to have urged the Roman Senate to refuse the proposals and then, over the protests of his own people, to have fulfilled the terms of his parole by returning to Carthage. His captors, it was said, promptly tortured him to death. The story is not found in the best surviving source, the 2nd-century bc Greek historian Polybius, but it is mentioned in the fragments of Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus (consul in 129 bc). Some historians have suggested that the story of the torture of Regulus was invented to excuse the subsequent torturing of two Carthaginian prisoners of war by Regulus’s widow (as reported by the historian Diodorus Siculus).
