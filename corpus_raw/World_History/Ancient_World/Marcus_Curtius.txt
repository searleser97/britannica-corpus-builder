Marcus Curtius,  a legendary hero of ancient Rome. According to legend, in 362 bc a deep chasm opened in the Roman Forum. The seers declared that the pit would never close until Romeâ€™s most valuable possession was thrown into it. Claiming that nothing was more precious than a brave citizen, Curtius leaped, fully armed and on horseback, into the chasm, which immediately closed. The spot was afterward covered by a pond, known as the Lacus Curtius, which was dry by the 1st century bc. The legend of Marcus Curtius is the most widespread of several tales invented to explain the origin of the name Lacus Curtius.
