Publius Helvius Pertinax,  (born Aug. 1, 126, Liguria [now in Italy]—died  March 28, 193), Roman emperor from January to March 193.
The son of a freed slave, Pertinax taught school, then entered the army, commanding units in Syria, in Britain, and on the Danube and the Rhine. He earned distinction during the great invasion by German tribes in 169. Given senatorial rank and command of a legion, he was soon promoted to the consular commands of Moesia, Dacia, and Syria, but under the emperor Commodus (reigned 180–192) he fell from favour, together with the future emperor Septimius Severus, during the ascendancy of the praetorian prefect Perennis (182–185). In the last years of Commodus’s life, Pertinax became prefect of the city of Rome, while Severus commanded the armies of the upper Danube. When Commodus was murdered on Dec. 31, 192, the Senate met before dawn and proclaimed Pertinax (then senior marshal of the empire) emperor. He tried to enforce unpopular economies in both civilian and military expenditure and was murdered by a small group of soldiers after less than three months in power. When Severus became emperor later in the year, he decreed divine honours for the slain ruler and took the name Pertinax.
