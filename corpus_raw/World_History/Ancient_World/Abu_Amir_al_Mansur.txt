Abū ʿĀmir al-Manṣūr, in full Muḥammad ibn Abū ʿĀmir al-Manṣūr, Latin and Spanish Almanzor,  (born c. 938—died  Aug. 10, 1002, Spain), the chief minister and virtual ruler of the Umayyad caliphate of Córdoba for 24 years (978–1002).
Manṣūr was descended from a member of the Arab army that conquered Spain. He began his career as a professional letter writer, becoming the protégé (and supposedly the lover) of the mother of the young caliph Hishām II (first reign 976–1009). In 978, with the aid of his father-in-law, General Ghālib, he overthrew and succeeded the vizier (chief minister). By giving African territories local independence under Umayyad suzerainty, Manṣūr reduced the drain on government resources. He replaced Slavs in the Cordoban army with Berber and Christian mercenaries and conducted a series of successful campaigns against the Christian states of northern Spain, including one against the great shrine of Santiago de Compostela in 997. In 981 he assumed the honorific title of al-Manṣūr bi-Allāh (“Made Victorious by God”), exercising supreme power in Córdoba, and in 994 he adopted the title of al-Malik al-Karīm (“Noble King”), while the caliph continued as nominal chief of state.
Manṣūr died on the way back from a campaign against Castile, the 50th of his expeditions, and was succeeded by his son; but his family, known as the ʿĀmirids, retained power for only a few more years.
