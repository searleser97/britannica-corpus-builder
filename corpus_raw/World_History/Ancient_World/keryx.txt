Kēryx,   inviolable ancient Greek messenger. In Homer’s time, the kēryx was simply a trusted attendant or retainer of a chieftain. The role of kērykes expanded, however, to include acting as inviolable messengers between states, even in time of war, proclaiming meetings of the council, popular assembly, or court of law, reciting there the formulas of prayer, and summoning persons to attend. Hermes, himself the kēryx of the gods, was their patron and carried the caduceus, the herald’s staff. The word also often simply meant a crier. A clan of kērykes had certain duties in connection with the Eleusinian Mysteries.
