Shamash-shum-ukin,  (flourished 7th century bc), crown prince of Babylon, son of Esarhaddon and brother of Ashurbanipal, the last of the great kings of Assyria. He led a coalition of Arabic tribes against Ashurbanipal, but, after being starved out by his brotherâ€™s siege of Babylon (684 bc), he capitulated. According to tradition, Shamash-shum-ukin committed suicide by making a pyre of his palace, treasury, and concubines.
