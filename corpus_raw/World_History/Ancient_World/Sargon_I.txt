Sargon I,  (flourished c. 1850 bc), ruler of Assyria during the old Akkadian period. Little is known in detail of Assyria during the time of Sargon, but clearly the Assyrian trading colony in Cappadocia, known from the tablets discovered at Kultepe, was then in its heyday. This information implies the ability of Sargon I to maintain the security of the trade routes, and the argument has been advanced that the colony in Cappadocia was actually within an area constituting an Assyrian province, a suggestion that derives some support from the existence of a tablet in Cappadocia bearing Sargonâ€™s seal.
