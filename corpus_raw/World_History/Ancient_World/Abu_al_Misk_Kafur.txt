Abū al-Misk Kāfūr,  (died ad 968), Ethiopian slave who, as vizier under the Ikshīdid dynasty, was de facto ruler of Egypt from 946 to 966 and de jure ruler from then until his death.
Kāfūr was originally a slave belonging to the founder of the Ikshīdid dynasty, Muḥammad ibn Ṭughj. Muḥammad recognized Kāfūr’s talent, made him tutor to his children, and promoted him to an officer. Kāfūr showed outstanding military abilities in the campaigns he conducted in Syria and the Hejaz. On his deathbed Muḥammad appointed Kāfūr guardian of one of his two sons, and thus Kāfūr became the real ruler of Egypt during the reign of Ūnūjūr (946–961) and his brother and successor, ‘Alī (961–966). Kāfūr ruled in his own name thereafter, but soon after his death in 968, Ikshīdid power in Egypt was overturned by the Fāṭimids.
The luxury and magnificence of Kāfūr’s court became legendary, but it accorded poorly with the general condition of Egypt, which had suffered from plague, famine, and a major earthquake during his rule. Kāfūr was a genuine scholar, however, and a patron of the greatest Arabic poet of the time, al-Mutanabbī, whose friend he was for a time.
