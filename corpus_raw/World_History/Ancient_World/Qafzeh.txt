Qafzeh, also spelled Kafzeh,  paleoanthropological site south of Nazareth, Israel, where some of the oldest remains of modern humans in Asia have been found. More than 25 fossil skeletons dating to about 90,000 years ago have been recovered. The site is a rock shelter first excavated in the early 1930s; excavation continued in the 1960s and early â€™70s.
The remains, the largest group yet recovered for this period in the Middle East, have been found with Middle Paleolithic tools, which are normally associated with Neanderthals in Europe and southwestern Asia. The fossils closely resemble ancestral African humans and represent a brief excursion of modern humans into Neanderthal-occupied areas during a warm period.
