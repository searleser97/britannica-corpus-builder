Marcus Aemilius Lepidus,  (died 13/12 bc), Roman statesman, one of the triumvirs who ruled Rome after 43.
He was the son of a prominent politician (d. c. 77 bc) of the same name. Lepidus joined the Caesarian side during the Civil War (49–45) between Caesar and the adherents of Pompey. He was praetor in 49, governor of Hither Spain in 48–47, and consul in 46. In 45 he became Caesar’s magister equitum (“master of the cavalry”). After the murder of Caesar, Lepidus joined the Caesarian leader Mark Antony against the conspirators. Antony obtained for Lepidus the office of pontifex maximus (“high priest”). When Antony was defeated in the fighting near Mutina (modern Modena) and was forced to flee to Gaul, Lepidus sided with Antony and was declared a public enemy by the Senate. In October 43 Lepidus formed a triumvirate with Antony and Octavian (later the emperor Augustus) at Bononia (modern Bologna). Lepidus received both Hither and Further Spain, along with southern Gaul, as his portion, and he celebrated his victories in Spain. He was consul again in 42, but his two colleagues soon deprived him of most of his power. His provinces of Gaul and Spain were taken from him, and he was confined to the government of Roman Africa and only formally included in the renewed triumvirate of 37. In 36 he attempted to raise Sicily in revolt against Octavian, but his soldiers deserted his cause. He was removed from even nominal membership in the triumvirate, and, although he was allowed to remain pontifex maximus until his death, he was forced to retire from public life.
