Quintus Lutatius Catulus,  (born c. 120 bc—died  61/60), Roman politician, a leader of the Optimates, the conservative faction in the Senate.
Catulus’ father, Quintus Lutatius Catulus, had been forced to commit suicide after Gaius Marius’ capture of Rome. The younger Catulus therefore became an adherent of Marius’ opponent, the commander Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who was dictator of Rome from 82 to 80. In 78, when he was consul, Catulus defeated an army led by his colleague in the consulship, Aemilius Lepidus, who sought to overthrow Sulla’s constitutional innovations. Catulus unsuccessfully opposed laws conferring extraordinary military powers upon the ambitious Pompey in 67 and 66; as censor in 65, Catulus fought the attempt of Marcus Licinius Crassus to enfranchise the Transpadane Gauls. A consistent opponent of Julius Caesar, Catulus suffered a bitter disappointment when Caesar was elected pontifex maximus (“high priest”) in 63 over his own far stronger claim. The Optimate leader unsuccessfully attempted to implicate Caesar in Catiline’s conspiracy to seize power (63), and in return Caesar in 62 accused Catulus of embezzling public funds—a charge that was later dropped.
