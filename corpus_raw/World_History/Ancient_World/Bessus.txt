Bessus,  (died c. 329 bc), Achaemenid satrap (governor) of Bactria and Sogdiana under King Darius III of Persia. In 330, after Alexander the Great had defeated Darius in several major battles, Bessus murdered Darius and assumed the kingship as Artaxerxes IV. He then attempted to continue resistance against Alexander in the eastern part of the empire but was captured and killed for his regicide.
