Battle of Edessa,  (260). Greece’s wars with Persia have acquired all but mythic status in the Western tradition, confirming European superiority over Oriental ways. Less well reported are the triumphs of the later Sassanid Persian Empire over Rome, culminating in the crushing defeat of Emperor Valerian at Edessa.
"A great battle took place beyond Carrhae and Edessa between us and Caesar Valerian," reads the inscription carved on a rocky outcrop at Naqsh-e Rustam in Iran. "We took him [Valerian] prisoner with our own hands," it continues—a flagrant boast, but well-justified.
The Sassanid emperor Shāpūr I had invaded Roman Mesopotamia and Syria in about 240: the Romans fought back, defeating the Persians at Resaena in 243. That the Romans now sued for peace owed more to grubby politics than military necessity: Philip the Arab, who had assassinated Gordian III and seized the imperial throne for himself, needed a chance to secure his position without outside pressure.
However, Shāpūr continued his depredations in the eastern parts of the Roman Empire, taking a number of territories. As emperor from 253, Valerian resolved to win these back. According to the Naqsh-e Rustam inscription, his army was 70,000 strong, and at first it seems to have made real headway. By the time the men reached Edessa (in what is now southeastern Turkey, near the Syrian border), they were beginning to flag, however. Valerian decided that his troops should hole up in the city, to which Shāpūr immediately laid siege. An outbreak of plague here cut a swath through what was soon a severely weakened Roman army. When Valerian led a deputation to Shāpūr’s camp to negotiate a settlement, he was captured with his staff and taken back to Persia as a prisoner. Valerian died in captivity.
Losses: Roman, more than 60,000; Persian, minimal.
