Bagoas,   (flourished  4th century bc), confidential minister of the Achaemenid king Artaxerxes III of Persia. His name was the Greek form of an Old Persian name often used for eunuchs.
Bagoas was commander in chief of the Achaemenid forces in the conquest of Egypt (343 bc) and gained wealth by selling back to the priests at an exorbitant price the sacred writings looted from Egyptian temples. He worked in close partnership with Mentor of Rhodes and rose to such power that he became the real master of the Achaemenid Empire, Artaxerxes doing nothing without his advice. In 338 Bagoas murdered Artaxerxes and all the kingâ€™s sons except Arses, whom he placed on the throne. Two years later he murdered Arses and made a collateral heir, Darius III, king. When Darius asserted his independence, Bagoas attempted to poison him, but the king had been warned and forced Bagoas to drink the poison himself.
