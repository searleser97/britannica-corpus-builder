Joseph Déchelette,  (born Jan. 8, 1862, Roanne, France—died  Oct. 8, 1914, Aisne), French archaeologist and author of an important work covering the entire field of the prehistory of France, Le Manuel d’archéologie préhistorique, celtique et gallo-romaine (1908–14; “Textbook of Prehistoric, Celtic, and Gallo-Roman Archaeology”).
With his uncle, J.-G. Bulliot, Déchelette excavated Gallic ruins at Mont Beuvray and described his findings in L’Oppidum de Bibracte (1903; “The Town of Bibracte”). He published 120 books and articles, but his reputation rests on his Manuel, an ambitious work, particularly valuable for its bibliography. It was completed by Albert Grenier after Déchelette’s death early in World War I.
