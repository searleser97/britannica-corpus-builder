Sogdian art,   rich body of pre-Muslim Central Asian visual arts that was created between roughly the 5th and 9th centuries and is represented most notably by finds at Pendzhikent and Varakhsha, town principalities in Sogdiana. Many cultural streams united there: the remains of Sāsānian culture, of post-Gupta India, and of China of the Sui and T’ang periods. Wall painting and carved wood were favoured types of decoration for dwellings. While the paintings seem to draw heavily on Persian tradition in the use of flat expanses of bright colour, hieratic poses, and simplified compositions, the remains of wood sculptures of swaying figures in flowing drapery are more suggestive of Indian sources.
The wall paintings, aside from their beauty and vigour, tell much of the life of these urban dwellers. They carefully reproduce details of costume, harness, gaming equipment, and so on; and their depictions of favourite stories and epic themes—drawing on Iranian (Zoroastrian), Near Eastern (Manichaean, Nestorian), and Indian (Hindu, Buddhist) sources for themes—testify to the varied cultural background of the period. This art, which helped to preserve much of the traditions and knowledge of Sāsānian Persia, died in the 10th century by the sword of Islām. See also Sogdiana.
