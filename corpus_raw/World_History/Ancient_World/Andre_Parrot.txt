André Parrot,  (born February 15, 1901, Désandans, Doubs, France—died August 24, 1980, Paris), French archaeologist, Protestant theologian, and museum director noted for having discovered the ancient Mesopotamian city of Mari (now in Syria), previously known only from references in Babylonian texts.
Parrot began excavations in 1933 at Tall al-Ḥarīrī and, from a temple dedication, was able to identify it as Mari. Still more exciting discoveries followed in 1935, when workers began to uncover the palace of King Zimrilim. The site revealed earlier buildings, dating from about 3500 bce, and thousands of tablets with cuneiform inscriptions of the 19th and 18th centuries bce.
Parrot also worked on sites in Lebanon and Iraq. In 1946 he was appointed chief curator of French national museums and undertook a major reorganization of Near Eastern antiquities in the Louvre. He became general inspector of museums in 1965 and from 1968 to 1972 was the first director of the Louvre. A member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, he wrote several books, most of which have been translated into English.
