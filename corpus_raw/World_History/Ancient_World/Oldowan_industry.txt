Oldowan industry,  toolmaking tradition characterized by crudely worked pebble (chopping) tools from the early Paleolithic, dating to about 2 million years ago and not formed after a standardized pattern. The tools are made of pebbles of quartz, quartzite, or basalt and are chipped in two directions to form simple, rough, all-purpose tools capable of chopping, scraping, or cutting. Flakes remaining from such work were also employed as tools. Such implements were made by early hominids (probably Homo habilis at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania; Omo, Ethiopia; and East Turkana, Kenya). Robust australopithecines were present at the same time and at the same sites, however. Some scholars believe the tools were made by more advanced forms living nearby; they base this argument on the observations that the robust australopithecines may have been vegetarians for whom tool using would not have been of great advantage and that more advanced forms have several times been found sharing the site with the robust hominid. Oldowan tools appear to have spread outside of Africa, perhaps carried by an early species of Homo. Tools of similar type have been found at sites including Vértesszőllős, Hung., and Chou-k’ou-tien, China. Tools of other materials, such as wood or bone, probably were also used by the makers of the Oldowan implements; wood has not been preserved, but bone tools have been recognized at Olduvai Gorge (a lissoir in Bed I) and Sterkfontein, S.Af. Stones arranged in a circle found in Bed I at Olduvai Gorge may have served as weights to hold down the edges of a windbreak used by early hominids. Oldowan tools were made for nearly 1 million years before gradual improvement in technique resulted in a standardized industry known as the Acheulian.
