Tukulti-Ninurta Epic,  the only extant Assyrian epic tale; it relates the wars between Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria (reigned c. 1243–c. 1207 bc) and Kashtiliashu IV of Babylonia (reigned c. 1232–c. 1225 bc). Written from the Assyrian point of view, the epic gives a strongly biased, though poetic, narrative. It is a late example of the primary epic style that was used especially during the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia bc.
