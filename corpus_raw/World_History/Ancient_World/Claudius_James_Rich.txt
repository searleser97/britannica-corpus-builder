Claudius James Rich,  (born March 28, 1787, Dijon, France—died October 5, 1821, Shīrāz, Iran), British business agent in Baghdad whose examination of the site of Babylon (1811) is considered the starting point of Mesopotamian archaeology.
Rich was a man of remarkable linguistic accomplishment; he knew Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Persian, Syriac, and several modern European languages from boyhood. Fluency in Turkish and Arabic served him well during his appointment, from age 21 until several months before his death, as East India Company resident at Baghdad, then under Ottoman dominion. His exceptional administrative ability helped to establish more than a century of British influence in Mesopotamia.
During periods of respite from the pressures of his office, he visited sites of ancient Mesopotamian cities and collected antiquities that were purchased by the British Museum in 1825 and became the foundation of Mesopotamian antiquarian studies in England. On his expedition to the site of Babylon he sketched, made an approximate survey of the area, dug up inscribed bricks, and had underground cavities explored. He concluded, however, that little more could be learned without excavation. His findings, published in a Viennese journal in 1812, were reprinted in Memoir on the Ruins of Babylon (1815) and expanded in Second Memoir on Babylon (1818).
