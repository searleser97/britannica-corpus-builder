David Randall-MacIver,  (born Oct. 31, 1873, London, Eng.—died April 30, 1945, New York, N.Y., U.S.), British-born American archaeologist and anthropologist.
Randall-MacIver was educated at the University of Oxford and began his career at the excavation (1899–1901) of Abydos, Egypt, led by Sir Flinders Petrie. After conducting excavations of the Zimbabwe ruins in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Randall-MacIver wrote Medieval Rhodesia (1906), in which he contended that the ruins were not built by an ancient and vanished white civilization as was currently believed but were of purely African origin and that they dated from about the 14th century; his view was borne out by later archaeological study.
From 1907 to 1911 Randall-MacIver led an expedition into Egypt and the Sudan. He was librarian of the American Geographical Society from 1911 to 1914 and served as an intelligence officer during World War I. He settled in Rome in 1921 and concentrated on Italian archaeology; his publications on the subject include Villanovans and Early Etruscans (1924), The Iron Age in Italy (1927), and Italy Before the Romans (1928). During World War II he assisted the U.S. Department of War in efforts to preserve Italian monuments from destruction.
