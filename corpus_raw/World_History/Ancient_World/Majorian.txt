Majorian, Latin in full Julius Valerius Majorianus,  (died Aug. 7, 461, Dertona, Liguria [now Tortona, Italy]), Western Roman emperor from 457 to 461, the only man to hold that office in the 5th century who had some claim to greatness.
Born of a distinguished military family, he served under the master of soldiers Aetius and helped overthrow the emperor Avitus (reigned 455–456). The real governmental power passed to Majorian’s friend Ricimer, who became for 16 years the kingmaker at Rome.
Appointed master of the soldiers in 457, Majorian quickly defeated the Alemannic invaders at Bellinzona (in present Switzerland). He was proclaimed emperor, with Ricimer’s support, on April 1 and set about conscientiously administering his realm. He stopped abuses in tax collection and attempted to protect the provincials from other forms of oppression.
In 458 Majorian began to build the fleet with which he hoped to recover Africa from the Vandals. After securing the support of Gaul, where a movement toward independent rule was in progress, and winning the praise of the poet Sidonius Apollinaris, he crossed into Spain in May 460. Most of Majorian’s fleet of 300 ships was captured at Carthago Nova (modern Cartagena) in the Bay of Alicante when the Vandal fleet under Gaiseric made a sudden strike on the Spanish coast. The emperor was subjected to a humiliating peace. On his return to Italy he fell into Ricimer’s hands (Aug. 2, 461) and was compelled to abdicate. Five days later he was executed.
