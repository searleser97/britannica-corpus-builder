Gylippus,   (flourished  5th century bc), Spartan general who in 414–413, during the Peloponnesian War, broke the Athenian siege of Syracuse, Sicily. Urged by the Athenian exile Alcibiades to send a general to take charge of the defense of Syracuse, the Spartans appointed Gylippus, and his arrival in 414 kept Syracuse from surrendering. Gylippus broke the Athenian blockade by land, organized resistance from other Sicilian states, and finally defeated his enemy’s fleet in a battle in the harbour. The Athenians attempted a retreat by land, then surrendered (413); Gylippus sought to spare their commanders, Nicias and Demosthenes, but was overruled. Later, Gylippus embezzled a large sum of Spartan funds and, when discovered, went into exile.
