Attalus III Philometor Euergetes (“Loving-his-mother Benefactor”),  (born c. 170 bc—died 133), king of Pergamum from 138 to 133 bc who, by bequeathing his domains to Rome, ended the history of Pergamum as an independent political entity. He was the son of Eumenes II (reigned 197–159) and nephew of Attalus II Philadelphus (reigned 159–138). Little is known of his reign. Attalus is said to have behaved tyrannically at first, but he evidently settled down to a quiet and studious life. His motives for bequeathing Pergamum to Rome are obscure. In 129 Rome organized the kingdom into the province of Asia.
