Demotic script,  Egyptian hieroglyphic writing of cursive form that was used in handwritten texts from the early 7th century bce until the 5th century ce. Demotic script derived from the earlier pictographic hieroglyphic inscriptions and the cursive hieratic script, and it began to replace hieratic writing during the reign of Psamtik I (664–610 bce). By the 5th century bce, demotic script—which the Egyptians called sekh shat, meaning “writing for documents”—had come into use everywhere in Egypt for business and literary purposes, although hieratic remained in use for religious texts. The demotic script began to be displaced by Greek during the Ptolemaic period (304–30 bce), but hieratic graffiti left by the priests of Isis at Philae date from as late as 452 ce.
The term demotic is also used for the everyday form of any language that has developed alternative (“high” versus “low”) levels of expression, such as in Greek and Arabic.
