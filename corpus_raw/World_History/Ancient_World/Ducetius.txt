Ducetius,   (died c. 440 bc), a Hellenized leader of the Siculi, an ancient people of Sicily, who for a short time welded the native communities of east Sicily into a powerful federation. He seized his opportunity during the confusion that followed the collapse of tyranny in Syracuse and other Sicilian states in 460. Enjoying the goodwill of the Syracusan democracy, he enlisted its help in driving out the colonists of the former tyrant Hieron from Catana and restoring it to its original Chalcidian inhabitants.
Ducetius then extended his influence over other communities and founded a new centre at Palice, but his independent policy led to an alliance of Syracuse and Acragas against him. After minor preliminary successes (including the capture of Inessa from its Greek colonists) he was decisively defeated by their combined forces in 450 and lost the confidence of the Siculi. On the strength of earlier connections, he took refuge in Syracuse and then went to Corinth.
In 446 Ducetius returned to Sicily and colonized Cale Acte on the north coast with Greeks and Siculi. From this centre he attempted to rebuild Siculi power, but his efforts were only partly successful before he died.
