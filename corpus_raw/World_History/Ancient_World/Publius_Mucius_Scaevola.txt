Publius Mucius Scaevola,  (died c. 115 bc), one of the foremost Roman jurists of his time and a prominent figure in the events surrounding the downfall of Tiberius Gracchus.
The son of Publius Mucius Scaevola, consul in 175 bc, Mucius held the office of people’s tribune in 141, when he instituted a tribunal to prosecute the corrupt ex-praetor Lucius Hostilius Tubulus, who was driven into exile. He was praetor in 136. When Tiberius Gracchus, as tribune, was formulating his laws for agrarian reform, he is reported to have consulted Mucius.
In 133, Scaevola was consul with Lucius Calpurnius Piso. Tiberius announced for an unprecedented second term as tribune. Scipio Nasica, as pontifex maximus (high priest), demanded that Scaevola condemn Tiberius as a tyrant. Scaevola refused, saying he would not be the one to resort to violence or jeopardize Tiberius’ rights without a trial.
When Tiberius was murdered during rioting begun by Scipio Nasica, Scaevola defended the actions of the pontifex maximus. Scaevola was one of the founders of the jus civile (“civil law”) and the author of legal works, none of which has survived. He seems to have continued the series of annales maximi, annual lists of magistrates and public events that became the foundation of Roman historiography.
