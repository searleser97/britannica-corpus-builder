Ramses VI, Ramses also spelled Ramesses or Rameses,  (flourished 12th century bce), king of ancient Egypt (reigned 1145–37 bce), who succeeded to the throne after the early death of his nephew, Ramses V.
Evidence indicates that Ramses VI was probably a son of Ramses III, the last outstanding ruler of the 20th dynasty (1190–1075 bce). After taking the throne, he annexed the tomb of his predecessor, Ramses V, which remains one of the most impressive of the Theban royal tombs.
Reigning at least seven years, the king accomplished little building or decoration that has survived to the present day, and, after he annexed his predecessor’s tomb, the size of the workmen’s gang on the royal tomb was reduced. He was the last Egyptian king to work the copper mines at Sinai; Nubia, Egypt’s territory to the south, however, remained under Egyptian control. Ramses was succeeded by his son Ramses VII, formerly identified as Ramses VIII.
