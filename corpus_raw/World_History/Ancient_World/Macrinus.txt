Macrinus, in full Caesar Marcus Opellius Severus Macrinus Augustus, original name Marcus Opellius Macrinus,  (born c. 164, Caesarea, Mauretania [now Cherchell, Algeria]—died  June 218, in Bithynia [now in Tur.]), Roman emperor in 217 and 218, the first man to rule the empire without having achieved senatorial status.
His skills as a lawyer helped him to rise rapidly in an equestrian career (a step below the senatorial career in status) until he became a praetorian prefect under the emperor Caracalla (reigned 211–217). Macrinus is alleged to have prompted the murder of Caracalla by an army officer in April 217, while the emperor was fighting the Parthians in what is now Iran. Three days after the assassination Macrinus was proclaimed emperor (augustus) by his army. He fought an inconclusive battle with the Parthians and then agreed to a peace that was unfavourable to Rome. The treaty was followed by pay cuts for the soldiers and by the decision to keep legions summoned from Europe for the Parthian war in Syria. At the same time, Julia Maesa spread the rumour that her grandson Bassianus (Elagabalus) was Caracalla’s natural son. The Gallic Third Legion, disgruntled at Macrinus’s policies, declared Elagabalus emperor in 218. With his remaining forces Macrinus fled toward Italy. He was overtaken, defeated in a battle near Antioch (modern Antakya, Tur.), and subsequently captured and executed.
