Wilhelm Adolf Becker,  (born 1796, Dresden, Saxony [Germany]—died Sept. 30, 1846, Meissen), German classical archaeologist, remembered for his works on the everyday life of the ancient Romans and Greeks.
Becker was educated at Schulpforta and Leipzig, and from 1842 he was professor of classical archaeology at Leipzig. His early studies of Plautus’ comedies aroused his interest in Roman daily life and led to his publication of Gallus (1838), the story of a Roman youth. Derived from Suetonius’ Life of Augustus and embellished to include all aspects of Roman life and customs, the book became a classic in its field, the English translation passing through 10 editions between 1844 and 1891. A similar work on Greek life, Charikles (1840), enjoyed comparable success. His Handbuch der römischen Altertumer, 5 vol. (1843–68; “Handbook of Roman Antiquities”), was completed by the classical scholars Theodor Mommsen and Joachim Marquardt.
