Nok culture, also called Nok figurine culture,  ancient Iron Age culture that existed on the Benue Plateau of Nigeria between about 500 bce and 200 ce.
First discovered in 1928 in the small tin-mining village of Nok, artifacts of similar features were found over an area that stretched about 300 miles (480 km) east to west and 200 miles (320 km) north to south. The most characteristic Nok artifacts are clay figurines of animals and stylized human beings, usually heads; perforated eyes of an elliptical or triangular shape are typical of the style. Other artifacts of the Nok culture include iron tools, stone axes and other stone tools, and stone ornaments.
