Androcles, also spelled Androclus,  Roman slave who allegedly lived about the time of the emperor Tiberius or Caligula and who became the hero of a story told by Aulus Gellius. The story, taken originally from a work by Apion (1st century ad) and also found in Aelian’s De natura animalium (On the Nature of Animals) and Seneca’s De beneficiis (On Benefits), tells that Androcles had taken refuge from the cruelties of his master in a cave in Africa, when a lion entered the cave and showed him his swollen paw, from which Androcles extracted a large thorn. Later, the grateful animal recognized him when Androcles had been captured and thrown to the wild beasts in the circus and, instead of attacking him, began to caress him; both were then set free. The story is the subject of the play Androcles and the Lion by George Bernard Shaw.
