Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy,  (born Aug. 3, 1844, Toulouse, France—died  Feb. 25, 1920, Paris), French archaeologist and civil engineer who excavated the palaces of the ancient Persian kings Darius I the Great and Artaxerxes II at Susa (modern Shūsh, Iran) in 1885 and gathered a large collection of archaeological fragments, which were placed in the Louvre.
Dieulafoy’s published works include L’Art antique de la Perse, 5 vol. (1884–89; “The Ancient Art of Persia”), and L’Acropole de Suse (1890–92; “The Acropolis of Susa”). His wife, Jeanne Magre Dieulafoy (1851–1916), who accompanied him on the expedition, published À Suse, journal des fouilles (1888; “At Susa, Journal of Excavations”). She also discovered the ruins of the famed 12th-century mosque at Hasan, Morocco, in 1912.
