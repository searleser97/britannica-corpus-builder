Honorius, in full Flavius Honorius,  (born September 9, 384—died August 15, 423), Roman emperor in the West from 393 to 423, a period when much of the Western Empire was overrun by invading tribes and Rome was captured and plundered by the Visigoths. The younger son of Theodosius I (emperor 379–395) and Aelia Flacilla, Honorius was elevated to the rank of augustus by Theodosius on January 23, 393, and became sole ruler of the West at age 10, upon his father’s death (January 17, 395). His brother Arcadius was the Eastern emperor.
During the first half of Honorius’s reign, power was exercised by his master of soldiers, Flavius Stilicho. In 398 the emperor married Stilicho’s daughter Maria. When Maria died, he married her younger sister, Thermantia, but terminated the union after Stilicho was executed on suspicion of treason in August 408.
During this early period of Honorius’s reign, the Vandals, Alani, and Suebi plundered Gaul (406) and then crossed into Spain. Imperial defenses deteriorated to such an extent that in 409 Honorius notified the cities of Bruttium (modern Calabria) that they could not rely on Rome for reinforcements against tribal incursions. In August 410 the Visigoths, under Alaric, occupied Rome, and Honorius fled to Ravenna. He watched from there while loyal generals overthrew usurpers and rebels, including Priscus Attalus, Maximus, and Jovinus. In 411 the rival emperor Constantine III of Gaul and Britain was crushed by Constantius, Honorius’s master of the soldiers. Constantius died late in 421, only a few months after Honorius had proclaimed him co-emperor. Constantius’s son, Valentinian III, succeeded Honorius as emperor of the West.
Honorius was one of the weakest of the Roman emperors. When he did intervene in politics, his actions were usually disastrous; thus, if he had been less obstinate in rejecting terms offered by Alaric before 410, Rome might have been spared the Gothic occupation.
