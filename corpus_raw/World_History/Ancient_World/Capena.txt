Capena,   ancient city of southern Etruria, Italy, frequently mentioned with the ancient Etruscan cities of Veii and Falerii. It was probably a colony of Veii, but after Veiiâ€™s fall it became subject to Rome.
Out of its territory the Stellatine tribe (one of the tribes of the Roman people) was formed in 367 bc. In addition to remains of Roman buildings, many tombs, especially of the 8th and 7th centuries bc, have been found in the neighbouring hills.
