Petronius Maximus, in full Flavius Ancius Petronius Maximus,  (born 396—died  May 31, 455, Rome [Italy]), Western Roman emperor from March 17 to May 31, 455. He was not recognized as emperor by the Eastern empire.
Maximus was prefect of Rome in 420 and twice served as consul. In 454 he and the eunuch Heraclius engineered the assassination of the powerful patrician Aetius. Proclaimed emperor the day after the emperor Valentinian III was murdered, Maximus immediately forced Valentinian’s widow, Eudoxia, to marry him. At the same time, a Vandal fleet, perhaps invited by Eudoxia, was approaching Rome; Maximus tried to escape but was caught by the enraged Roman populace and torn limb from limb.
