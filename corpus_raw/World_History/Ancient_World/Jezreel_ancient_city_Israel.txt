Jezreel, Hebrew Yizreʿel,   (May God Give Seed), ancient city of Palestine, capital of the northern kingdom of Israel under King Ahab, located on a spur of Mt. Gilboa in Israel. King Saul was slain there in a battle with the Philistines. It was called Esdraelon in the book of Judith; to the crusaders it was Parvum Gerinum, or Le Petit Gerin, to distinguish it from Le Grand Gerin (Jenin).
The Valley of Jezreel (ʿEmeq Yizreʿel), or Plain of Esdraelon, was an ancient trade route between the Jordan Valley and the coastal plain. Modern excavation in the area uncovered a distinctive gray-burnished pottery, which archaeologists now call Esdraelon ware.
Jezreel was also the name of a town in the territory of Judah; Khirbet Tarrama, near Hebron, has been suggested as the site. The first son of the prophet Hosea was named Jezreel, as a reminder of the bloodshed at Jezreel by which King Jehu (ruled 842–815 bc) came into power.
