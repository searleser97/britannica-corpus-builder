Capsian industry,  a Mesolithic (8000 bc–2700 bc) cultural complex prominent in the inland areas of North Africa. Its most characteristic sites are in the area of the great salt lakes of what is now southern Tunisia, the type site being Jabal al-Maqṭaʿ, near Qafṣah (Capsa, French Gafsa). Although the tool kit of the Capsian is a classic example of the industries of the late Würm Glacial Period, and, while it is apparently related to the Gravettian stage of Europe’s Perigordian industry (which dates from about 17,000 years ago), it does not properly belong to the glacial period at all but clearly occurs in Neothermal (postglacial) times. Like its predecessor, the Ibero-Maurusian industry (or Oranian industry), the Capsian was a microlithic (tiny-flaked-blade) tool complex. It differed from the Ibero-Maurusian, however, in displaying a far more varied tool kit distinguished by large backed blades and burins in its earlier phase and a gradual development of geometric microliths later. These became its leading feature by the 6th millennium bc, when they seem to have been transmitted to the final Ibero-Maurusian groups along the coast. Some North African rock paintings are attributed to people of the Capsian industry. Compare Perigordian industry; Ibero-Maurusian industry.
