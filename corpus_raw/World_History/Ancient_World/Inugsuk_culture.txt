Inugsuk culture,   Eskimo culture that developed from the Thule culture (q.v.) in northern Greenland during the 12th and 13th centuries. It was distinguished by an increased dependence on hunting by means of a kayak (a one-man skin boat) and implements associated with this development. Dog-drawn sleds and umiaks (large, open skin boats) also provided transportation. Bone, wood, whalebone, and stone were used in manufacture. There were distinctive types of harpoon heads as well as articles that show a Norse influence (there were Norse settlements in southern Greenland from 985 to about 1500), such as small wooden containers produced by the coopering technique and trade goods such as church-bell metal and woven wool cloth.
The Inugsuk culture spread southward along the west coast of Greenland to its tip and then moved northward along the east coast. In northeastern Greenland the Inugsuk mixed with earlier cultural elements, forming the hybrid Northeast Greenland mixed culture, beginning about the 16th century.
From about 1600, individual coastal settlements began to lose contact with one another, some becoming depopulated or breaking up. In the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the Inugsuk Eskimo again came into contact with European culture, this time with whale hunters and then Danish colonizers. The Northeast Greenland Eskimo disappeared in the 19th century, for unknown reasons. Present Greenland culture is based on the mixture of European and Eskimo cultures.
