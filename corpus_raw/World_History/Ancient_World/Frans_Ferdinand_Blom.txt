Frans Ferdinand Blom,  (born August 9, 1893, Copenhagen—died June 23, 1963, San Cristóbal, Mexico), Danish archaeologist who was an authority on Mayan culture. He spent much of his life in the jungles of Chiapas state (adjoining Guatemala) where his explorations led to the discovery of several long-lost cities attributed to the “classical period” (ad 300–900) in the history of the central Maya lowlands.
After graduating from the University of Copenhagen, Blom immigrated to the United States in 1919 and received his M.A. from Harvard University in 1925. As a Mexican government archaeologist (1922–23) and subsequently as a member of American and joint Danish-American expeditions, he uncovered priceless examples of Mayan art and architecture at Palenque, Uaxactún (Guatemala), and Veracruz.
While exploring the Lacandon jungle in 1948 he discovered the last remnants of the Lacandon people, descendants of the original Mayans. From 1925 to 1941 Blom was director of the Middle American Research Institute of Tulane University, New Orleans. After settling in Mexico in 1950, he and his wife, Gertrude, established in San Cristóbal de Las Casas a research centre, museum, and library devoted to Mayan culture, about which he wrote several books, including Tribes and Temples (1926–27; with Olivier La Farge) and Conquest of Yucatán (1936).
