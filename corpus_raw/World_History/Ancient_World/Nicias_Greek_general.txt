Nicias,   (died 413 bc, Sicily [now in Italy]), Athenian politician and general during the Peloponnesian War (431–404 bc) between Sparta and Athens. He was in charge of the Athenian forces engaged in the siege of Syracuse, Sicily, and the failure of the siege contributed greatly to the ultimate defeat of Athens.
In the first 10 years of the conflict, Nicias proved his ability as a leader of offensive expeditions and in 421 negotiated the Peace of Nicias and an alliance with Sparta. The hostility of Sparta’s allies and the opposition of the Athenian general Alcibiades, however, foiled Nicias’ efforts to uphold the peace. Warfare was renewed, and in 415 Nicias reluctantly allowed himself to be appointed, with Alcibiades and Lamachus, leader of the Sicilian expedition.
The recall of Alcibiades and the death of Lamachus left Nicias, although ill, in sole charge of the siege of Syracuse. The wall his forces attempted to build around Syracuse was not completed owing to the defenders’ efforts. Nicias asked to be relieved of his command, but instead reinforcements under Demosthenes arrived early in 413. When these failed to reverse the situation, Demosthenes favoured the withdrawal of the Athenian army, but an eclipse of the Moon occurred on Aug. 27, 413, and the superstitious Nicias accepted his soothsayers’ advice to delay setting out. The Syracusans soon afterward forced the surrender of the Athenian forces, including Nicias, whom they executed.
