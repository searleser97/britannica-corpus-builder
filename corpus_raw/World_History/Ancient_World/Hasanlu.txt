Hasanlu,   ancient Iranian site located in the Solduz Valley of Azerbaijan. Excavations there have been important for knowledge of the prehistory of northwestern Iran, especially during the late 2nd and early 1st millennia bc.
The site was inhabited from about 2100 to about 825 bc, but the richest period yet excavated dates to the 10th and 9th centuries bc. That period, often called “Mannaean” after the name of the people who lived in the area, is characterized by a gray pottery accompanied by black and red varieties, the black ware being of much finer quality and probably made in imitation of metal vessels.
Hasanlu was crowned by a high citadel surrounded by a strong fortification wall. The outer town, which was unfortified, consisted primarily of ordinary dwellings and a cemetery. Among the most important objects uncovered at Hasanlu were an unusually decorated silver bowl, several iron garment pins headed by bronze lions, a solid gold bowl, a knife handle with gold cloisonné, and two hollow bronze horse heads that served to hold liquids. Parallels to the motifs on the Hasanlu objects have been found in Elam, Assyria, north Syria, and Urartu, indicating that Iran not only received considerable cultural and artistic stimuli from other areas but also in turn exerted influence on the Middle East.
