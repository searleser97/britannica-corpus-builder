Pacorus, also called Pacorus I,  (died 38 bc), Parthian prince, son of King Orodes II (reigned c. 55/54–37/36 bc); he apparently never ascended the throne.
In the summer of 51 bc Pacorus was sent to invade Syria with an army commanded by Osaces, an older warrior. Osaces, however, was killed in battle, and early the next year Orodes, learning that one of his satraps was conspiring to make Pacorus king, recalled his son. In 45, Pacorus intervened in Roman politics by leading a Parthian force to help one of Pompey’s generals who was besieged in Apamea (a city in northwestern Mesopotamia) by Augustus’ forces.
Orodes later decided to support the refugee republican general Quintus Labienus; thus Pacorus led an army into Syria and Palestine while Labienus occupied Cilicia and overran southern Anatolia. In 39, Mark Antony sent Publius Ventidius against Labienus, who was defeated and killed. Pacorus returned to Syria, was lured into battle by Ventidius, and was defeated and killed. His head was displayed in the cities of Syria to convince them of the futility of hoping for Parthian support against the Romans.
