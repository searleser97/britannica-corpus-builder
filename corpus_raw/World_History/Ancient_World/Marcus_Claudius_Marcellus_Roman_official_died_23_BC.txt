Marcus Claudius Marcellus,  (born 42 bc—died 23 bc, Baiae, Campania [Italy]), nephew of the emperor Augustus (reigned 27 bc–ad 14) and presumably chosen by him as heir, though Augustus himself denied it.
Marcellus was the son of Gaius Claudius Marcellus and Augustus’s sister Octavia. In 25 he and the future emperor Tiberius served under Augustus in Spain. That same year he was married to the emperor’s daughter Julia, an event that seemed to mark him as heir. His ambitions brought him into conflict with Agrippa, but he died two years later. At the time of his death, he was a curule aedile, a magistrate’s office that he held at a younger age than normal and that he celebrated with exceptionally magnificent games. Great hopes had been built on him, and he was celebrated by many writers, especially by Virgil in a famous passage in the Aeneid and in Propertius. He was buried in the mausoleum of Augustus, and Augustus himself pronounced the funeral oration. Octavia built a library in his honour, while Augustus named a theatre after him, the remains of which were standing in the 21st century.
