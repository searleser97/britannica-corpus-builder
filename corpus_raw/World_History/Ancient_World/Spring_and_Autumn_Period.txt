Spring and Autumn Period, Chinese (Pinyin) Chunqiu Shidai, or (Wade-Giles romanization) Ch’un-ch’iu Shih-tai,  (770–476 bc), in Chinese history, the period during the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 bc)—specifically the first portion of the Dong (Eastern) Zhou—when many vassal states fought and competed for supremacy. It was named for the title of a Confucian book of chronicles, Chunqiu, covering the period 722–479 bc.
During the Spring and Autumn Period the imperial house, with priestly, ritualistic, and diplomatic functions but with diminishing authority, slowly sank out of sight as the local nobles struggled with one another for power. Survival required coalitions, both political and economic, as well as the accumulation of productive wealth. To this end, many drainage operations, canals, dikes, reservoirs, roads, and the like were undertaken, often on an interstate or multistate basis. Long walls too were thrown up as a means of protection not only against one another but also against aboriginal and nomadic tribes. Merchants and artisans began to assume some significance. Education and intellectual life advanced, this being the period of Confucius and other famous thinkers.
