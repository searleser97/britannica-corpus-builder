Tribe, Latin Tribus, plural Tribi,  in Roman history, a unit of the Roman state. The first Roman tribes were probably ethnic in origin and consisted of the Titienses (Tities), Ramnenses (Ramnes), and Luceres. They were superseded by the creation of new local tribes (date uncertain) consisting of 4 urban tribes and 16 rural, or rustic, tribes. The latter were probably named after pagi (country districts) that were, in turn, known by the principal gentes (clans) settled on that territory. The number of rural tribes was increased until by 241 bc they totaled 35. The additional tribes were instituted in new Roman territory on the Italian peninsula where Romans settled; moreover, original inhabitants who had been granted Roman citizenship were also enrolled in those added rural tribes. In later times there was no geographic significance involved with the enrollment of citizens in tribes. The lower classes and freed slaves, however, seem to have been enrolled mostly in the less-numerous urban tribes.
Provincial communities (civitates) as well as individuals who were granted Roman citizenship under the empire (from 27 bc) were all enrolled in a particular tribe. The tribes served as units for purposes of taxation, military conscription, and census taking.
