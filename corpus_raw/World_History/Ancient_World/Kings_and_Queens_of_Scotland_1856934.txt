 Scotland, now part of the United Kingdom, was ruled for hundreds of years by various monarchs. James I, who in 1603 became king of England after having held the throne of Scotland (as James VI) since 1567, was the first to style himself “king of Great Britain,” although Scotland and England did not formally merge to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain until the Act of Union of 1707.
The table provides a chronological list of kings and queens of Scotland.
