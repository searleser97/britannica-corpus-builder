Diogenes of Babylon,  (flourished 2nd century bce), Greek Stoic philosopher remembered chiefly for his visit to Rome in 156â€“155 bce, which served to arouse interest in the Stoic creed among the Romans.
Diogenes was born at Seleucia on the Tigris, a centre of Hellenistic culture in Mesopotamia. He studied in Athens under Chrysippus, the principal systematizer of Stoic philosophy, and succeeded Zeno of Tarsus as head of the Stoic school there. Panaetius, who founded Roman Stoicism, was one of his pupils.
