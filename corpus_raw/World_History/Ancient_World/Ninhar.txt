Ninhar, also called Ningubla,  in Mesopotamian religion, Sumerian deity, city god of Kiabrig, near Ur in the southern herding region. Ninhar was god of the thunder and rainstorms that made the desert green with pasturage in the spring; as such he was represented in the form of a roaring bull. He was the son of Nanna (Akkadian: Sin) and Ningal and the husband of Ninigara (Lady of Butter and Cream), goddess of the dairy.
