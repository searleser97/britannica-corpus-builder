Dali, Wade-Giles romanization Ta-li,  site of paleoanthropological excavations near Jiefang village in Dali district, Shaanxi (Shensi) province, China, best known for the 1978 discovery of a well-preserved cranium that is about 200,000 years old. It resembles that of Homo erectus in having prominent browridges, a receding forehead, a ridge along the rear of the skull, and thick cranial walls. Its cranial capacity is 1,120 cc (68 cubic inches), which is intermediate between H. erectus and H. sapiens. The facial bones are distorted, but its true morphology was undoubtedly flatter and smaller than is characteristic of H. erectus and other archaic varieties of early humans (genus Homo), including Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis). Because of its combination of primitive and modern features, it is difficult to classify. Originally called H. sapiens daliensis, it was argued to have been part of a continuous evolutionary line from H. erectus to modern populations of Asia. Another possibility is that the Dali cranium belongs to H. heidelbergensis or a late form of H. erectus that evolved traits like those of H. sapiens.
