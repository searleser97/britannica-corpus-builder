Shajing culture, Wade-Giles romanization Sha-ching,  blade-tool culture that existed along the present region of the Great Wall in northwestern China as early as 1000 bce. The Shajing remains were first uncovered by the Swedish geologist Johan Gunnar Andersson in 1923 in the village of Shajing in north-central Gansu province. Large-scale excavations in the area were later conducted by Chinese archaeologists in the late 1970s and early ’80s, especially in an ancient walled township site named Sanjiaocheng (Chinese: “Triangle City”).
The artifacts of the group were mainly brick-red gritty bowls, stone tools, and large tri-legged vessels of gray pottery. Evidence of bronze technology was found in smaller articles, such as bronze knives, buttons, and arrowheads. The members of the culture appear to have lived in large village settlements, which have been found to contain clay huts and well-dug storage pits. The group apparently survived until the time of the Dong (Eastern) Zhou dynasty (770–256 bce), coexisting with the more sophisticated cultures of historical China.
