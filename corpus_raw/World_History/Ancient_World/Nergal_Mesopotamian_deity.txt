Nergal,  in Mesopotamian religion, secondary god of the Sumero-Akkadian pantheon. He was identified with Irra, the god of scorched earth and war, and with Meslamtaea, He Who Comes Forth from Meslam. Cuthah (modern Tall Ibrāhīm) was the chief centre of his cult. In later thought he was a “destroying flame” and had the epithet sharrapu (“burner”). Assyrian documents of the 1st millennium bc describe him as a benefactor of men, who hears prayers, restores the dead to life, and protects agriculture and flocks. Hymns depict him as a god of pestilence, hunger, and devastation.
The other sphere of Nergal’s power was the underworld, of which he became king. According to one text, Nergal, escorted by demons, descended to the underworld where the goddess Ereshkigal (or Allatum) was queen. He threatened to cut off her head, but she saved herself by becoming his wife, and Nergal obtained kingship over the underworld.
Nergal did not figure prominently in epics and myths, although he did have a part in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Deluge story. The cult of Nergal was widespread beyond the borders of Sumer and Akkad, where it first appeared. He had a sanctuary at Mari (modern Tell al-Ḥarīrī), on the Euphrates. He is named in inscriptions of Assyrian kings, and evidence of his cult is found in Canaan and at Athens.
