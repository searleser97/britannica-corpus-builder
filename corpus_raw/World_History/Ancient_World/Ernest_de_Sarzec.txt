Ernest de Sarzec, in full Gustave-Charles-Ernest Chocquin de Sarzec,  (born 1832, Rennes, France—died 1901, Poitiers), French archaeologist whose excavation of the mound of Tello (ancient Girsu, Arabic Tall Lūḥ), in present-day southern Iraq, uncovered the Sumerian capital of Lagash and revealed much of what is known about the art, language, and history of the most ancient of Mesopotamian civilizations.
In 1874, while serving as French vice consul at Basra (al-Baṣrah), Ottoman Mesopotamia, now in Iraq, Sarzec learned that old statuettes had been observed at Tello. Securing the exclusive right to excavate the site, he began digging in 1877 and continued working there intermittently until 1901, systematically excavating the entire area and offering the modern world its first glimpse of Sumerian culture.
His discovery in 1880 of a diorite portrait sculpture of Gudea (c. 2150–2050 bce), the seventh governor of Lagash, and other artworks was one of the celebrated achievements of 19th-century Assyriology. In addition to architectural remains and many works of art, weapons, vessels, and other artifacts, he found evidence of Sumer’s greatest legacy to Babylonia—writing. From the temple archives he secured about 30,000 inscribed clay tablets yielding much information on temple administration, commerce, farming, and stock raising. In conjunction with L. Heuzey he published Découvertes en Chaldée (1884–1912; “Discoveries in Chaldea”). The extensive collection of Sumerian art in the Louvre is largely the result of Sarzec’s work.
