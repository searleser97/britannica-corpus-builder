Cottius, also called Marcus Julius Cottius,  (flourished  1st century bc), king and then prefect of the Ligurian tribes living in the area now called the Cottian Alps, centred on Mount Cenis and the Montgenèvre Pass.
Cottius was the son of King Donnus, who had initially opposed but eventually entered into friendly relations with Julius Caesar. After succeeding his father, Cottius maintained his independence while the emperor Augustus subdued other Alpine tribes. Finally, Augustus secured submission by naming him prefect (praefectus) of about 12 of the tribes. Later (about 8 bc), Cottius showed his gratitude by erecting a triumphal arch in honour of Augustus (which still stands in Susa [ancient Segusio]). He also improved the road over the Montgenèvre Pass.
Cottius’ authority was transmitted to his son of the same name, Marcus Julius Cottius, on whom the emperor Claudius conferred the title of king; but, after this king’s death, the emperor Nero reduced the area to a Roman province, Alpes Cottiae.
