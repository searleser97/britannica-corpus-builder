Percy Gardner,  (born Nov. 24, 1846, London, Eng.—died  July 17, 1937, Oxford, Oxfordshire), English archaeologist who was noted for his contributions to the study of Greek numismatics.
Gardner was a prolific writer and lecturer on numismatics, Greek art, and religious subjects, as well as a gifted teacher. He was educated at Christ’s College, Cambridge, and while a member of the department of coins and medals at the British Museum, London, he contributed several volumes to the museum’s Catalogue of Greek Coins. In 1880 he became a professor of archaeology at the University of Cambridge and the first editor of the Journal of Hellenic Studies, which he cofounded. In 1887 he transferred to the University of Oxford, where he taught for 38 years.
Among his best-known works are The Types of Greek Coins (1883), important for demonstrating the ways in which coinage reflects the history of Greek cities and the development of Greek art, Samos and Samian Coins (1882), and New Chapters in Greek Art (1926). His Principles of Greek Art (1913), an elaboration of Grammar of Greek Art (1905), became a standard introduction.
