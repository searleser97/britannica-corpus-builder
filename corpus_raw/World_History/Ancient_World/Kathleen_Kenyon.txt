Dame Kathleen Kenyon, in full Dame Kathleen Mary Kenyon,  (born January 5, 1906, London, England—died August 24, 1978, Wrexham, Clwyd [now in Wrexham], Wales), English archaeologist who excavated Jericho to its Stone Age foundation and showed it to be the oldest known continuously occupied human settlement.
After working (1929) with the British archaeologist Gertrude Caton-Thompson at the Zimbabwe ruins in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Kenyon directed much attention to the archaeological remains of ancient Britain, working at a number of sites and publishing numerous findings between 1930 and 1951. She excavated the Roman town of Sabratha in 1948–49 and 1951. She was associated with the University of London Institute of Archaeology from 1935 to 1962 and served as principal of St. Hugh’s College, Oxford, from 1962 to 1973. In 1973 she was created Dame of the British Empire.
While serving as director of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem from 1951 to 1966, Kenyon conducted her researches (1952–58) at Tell as-Sulṭān, Jordan, the site of prehistoric and Old Testament Jericho. Though her chief interests lay in determining the dates of its initial settlement (8th millennium bc) and its destruction by Joshua and the Israelites (c. 1425 bc), she accomplished much more. She placed the establishment of an agricultural economy at about 7000 bc, from which a massive stone wall and a great tower also date, and found an elaborate domestic architecture from the 7th millennium. The unearthing of extraordinary 7th-millennium portrait sculptures of plaster modeled over human skulls was particularly illustrative of her meticulous excavation technique. From 1961 to 1967 she turned her attention to Jerusalem. Writings related to her later work include Digging up Jericho (1957), Excavations at Jericho (vol. 1, 1960; 2, 1965), Amorites and Canaanites (1966), Royal Cities of the Old Testament (1970), and Digging up Jerusalem (1974).
