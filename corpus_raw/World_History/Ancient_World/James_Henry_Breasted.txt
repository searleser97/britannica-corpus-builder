James Henry Breasted,  (born August 27, 1865, Rockford, Illinois, U.S.—died December 2, 1935, New York City, New York), American Egyptologist, archaeologist, and historian who promoted research on ancient Egypt and the ancient civilizations of western Asia.
After graduate studies at Yale and Berlin, Breasted began teaching Egyptology at the University of Chicago in 1894. He compiled a record of every known Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription and published a translation of these in a five-volume work, Ancient Records of Egypt (1906). He led expeditions to Egypt and the Sudan (1905–07) and copied inscriptions from monuments that had been previously inaccessible or were perishing. His History of Egypt (1905) and his high school textbook, Ancient Times (1916), both lucidly written, enjoyed extraordinary success. A pioneer work in a specialized field was Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt (1912).
Through financial aid from John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Breasted organized the Oriental Institute (1919) at the University of Chicago. This institution became an internationally renowned centre for the study of ancient cultures in southwest Asia and the Middle East. Under his directorship, the institute undertook a number of important excavations, including one at Megiddo that uncovered a large riding stable thought to have been King Solomon’s and one at Persepolis that yielded some Achaemenid sculptures.
