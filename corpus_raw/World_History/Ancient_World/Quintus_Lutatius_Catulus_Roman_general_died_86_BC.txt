Quintus Lutatius Catulus,  (died 86 bc), Roman general, at first a colleague and later a bitter enemy of the politically powerful commander Gaius Marius.
As consul with Marius in 102, Catulus was sent to hold the passage of the Alps from the invading Cimbri and Teutoni tribes, but he was forced back to the Po River. In 101 the Cimbri were defeated in the Raudian Fields, near modern Vercelli, Italy, by the united armies of Catulus and Marius. When the chief credit for this victory went to Marius, Catulus sided with Marius’ political rival, Lucius Cornelius Sulla. After Marius’ capture of Rome late in 87, Catulus was forced to commit suicide. Catulus was distinguished as an orator, poet, and prose writer.
