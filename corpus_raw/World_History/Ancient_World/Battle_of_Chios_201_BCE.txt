Battle of Chios,  (201 bce). The naval defeat of Philip V of Macedon at Chios was the last large-scale naval battle between fleets sent out by independent Greek states. At the time, it was thought that it had secured independence for the smaller states, but in fact it only opened the way for Roman domination of Greece.
With Rome busy fighting Carthage, King Philip V of Macedon took the opportunity to increase his territory and power in Greece and around the Aegean. By 201 bce only Rhodes and Pergamum remained hostile. Philip laid siege to Pergamum, but was driven off. He was retreating in his fleet toward his base on Samos when the fleets of Pergamum and Rhodes came into sight.
Philip had fifty-three cataphract ships—large oared galleys with enclosed sides—plus about 150 lembi, small galleys with open decks. King Attalus of Pergamum had about fifty medium and large oared galleys; Theophiliscus of Rhodes had about seventy. Both sides formed up in line abreast and advanced. Theophiliscus hoped to use his skilled crews to outmaneuver the larger Macedonian ships and ram them, while Philip hoped to use his lembi to hamper the enemy’s movements and leave them easy prey for his large but cumbersome cataphracts.
On the allies’ left wing, Attalus engaged in a melee with the Macedonian right wing, which hung in the balance until Philip brought up his reserve squadron. Attalus fled, though many of his ships remained in action. The more skilled Rhodian crews evaded the lembi and outmaneuvered the Macedonian cataphracts, ramming and sinking many of them. The death of Theophiliscus did nothing to slow the Rhodian attacks. Returning from driving off Attalus, Philip realized he faced defeat and drew his remaining ships off in good order.
Losses: Macedonian, 92 ships sunk, 7 captured of 200 engaged; Greek allied, 6 ships sunk, 2 captured of 130.
