Marcus Claudius Marcellus,  (born c. 268 bc—died  208, near Venusia, Apulia [now Venosa, Italy]), Roman general who captured Syracuse during the Second Punic War (218–201). Although his successes have been exaggerated by the historian Livy, Marcellus deserved his sobriquet, “the sword of Rome.”
In his first consulship (222) Marcellus fought the Insubres and won the spolia opima (“spoils of honour”; the arms taken by a general who killed an enemy chief in single combat) for the third and last time in Roman history. He relieved the Roman garrison at Clastidium (modern Casteggro) and captured Mediolanum (modern Milan). After the Roman defeat at Cannae (216), he commanded the remnant of the army at Canusium and saved Nola and southern Campania from Hannibal. From 214, when he was consul for the third time, to 211 he served in Sicily, where he stormed Leontini and, after a two-year siege, took Syracuse. His troops killed the great scientist Archimedes and sacked the city, while Marcellus carried its art treasures to Rome. Marcellus was consul again in 210 and took Salapia in Apulia, which had revolted and joined forces with Hannibal. In 209 he fought Hannibal inconclusively near Venusia. In his fifth consulship (208) he was killed in an ambush while reconnoitering enemy positions.
