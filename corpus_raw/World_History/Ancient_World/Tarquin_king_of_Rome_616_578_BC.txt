Tarquin, Latin in full Lucius Tarquinius Priscus,  original name Lucomo,  (flourished  6th century bc), traditionally the fifth king of Rome, accepted by some scholars as a historical figure and usually said to have reigned from 616 to 578.
His father was a Greek who went to live in Tarquinii, in Etruria, from which Lucumo moved to Rome on the advice of his wife, the prophet Tanaquil. Changing his name to Lucius Tarquinius, he was appointed guardian to the sons of King Ancus Marcius. Upon the king’s death Tarquin assumed the throne. Eventually Ancus’ sons had Tarquin murdered. Tanaquil then managed to put her son-in-law Servius Tullius in power.
The legends maintain that Tarquin increased the number of persons of senatorial and equestrian rank. He is thought to have instituted the Roman Games and to have begun the construction of a wall around the city.
