Clovis complex,  ancient culture that was widely distributed throughout North America. It is named for the first important archaeological site found, in 1929, near Clovis, N.M. Clovis sites were long believed to have dated to about 9500 to 9000 bc, although early 21st-century analyses suggest the culture may have been of shorter duration, from approximately 9050 to 8800 bc.
The Clovis complex is generally considered to be ancestral to the Folsom complex. Clovis and Folsom were hunting-and-gathering cultures; although both groups were fairly generalized foragers, Clovis people seemed to have preferred to eat Pleistocene megafauna such as mammoths, while Folsom people seem to have preferred an extinct species of giant bison.
Associated with Clovis are such implements as bone tools, hammerstones, scrapers, and projectile points. The typical Clovis point is leaf-shaped, with parallel or slightly convex sides and a concave base. The edges of the basal portions are ground somewhat, probably to prevent the edge from severing the hafting cord. Clovis points range in length from 1.5 to 5 inches (4 to 13 centimetres) and are heavy and fluted, though the fluting rarely exceeds half the length. Some eastern variants of Clovis—called Ohio, Cumberland, or Suwannee, depending on their origin—are somewhat fish-tailed and also narrower relative to length.
