Giuseppe Fiorelli,  (born June 8, 1823, Naples, Kingdom of Naples [Italy]—died  Jan. 28, 1896, Naples), Italian archaeologist whose systematic excavation at Pompeii helped to preserve much of the ancient city as nearly intact as possible and contributed significantly to modern archaeological methods.
Fiorelli’s initial work at Pompeii was completed in 1848. Then, when he became professor of archaeology at the University of Naples and director of excavations at Pompeii (1860), he pioneered his meticulous method of studying archaeological strata; observation, recording, preservation (including building a museum), and reporting were its fundamental features. In particular he studied the materials and building methods utilized at Pompeii and published Descrizione di Pompei (1875; “Description of Pompeii”), among many other works. He was named director of the National Museum, Naples (1863), and director general of Italian antiquities and fine arts (1875–96).
