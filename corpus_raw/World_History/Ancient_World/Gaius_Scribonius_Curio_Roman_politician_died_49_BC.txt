Gaius Scribonius Curio,  (died 49 bc), Roman politician, partisan of Julius Caesar against Pompey. He was the son of a statesman and orator of the same name.
Curio was elected tribune for the year 50 bc. When the Senate demanded that year that Caesar surrender his imperium before entering Rome, Curio advocated that Pompey do the same, adding that, if the two generals refused to comply, both ought to be declared public enemies. His proposal was carried, but the consuls ignored it and called upon Pompey to undertake the command of all the troops stationed in Italy. Fleeing to Caesar at Ravenna, Curio was commissioned to take a message to the Senate. He met with so hostile a reception that he hurried back to Caesar. In the Civil War, Curio collected troops for Caesar in Umbria and Etruria and was sent by him to Sicily as propraetor in 49. After some successes against the forces loyal to Pompey, Curio crossed over to Africa, where he was defeated and killed by Juba, king of Numidia. The first amphitheatre in Rome was erected by him in 50 bc for the celebration of the funeral games of his father.
