Gaius Fabricius Luscinus,  (flourished 3rd century bc), Roman commander and statesman whose incorruptibility and austerity were frequently regarded as models of the early Roman virtues.
Originally from Aletrium in Latium, Fabricius settled in Rome and about 285 negotiated a dispute for the Romans with the people of Tarentum. He was consul in 282 and 278 and censor in 275. During the first consulship he rescued Thurii from defeat by the Lucanians and Bruttiansâ€”peoples of southern Italy. After Pyrrhus, king of Epirus in Greece, invaded Italy and defeated the Romans at Heraclea (280), Fabricius was sent to negotiate the ransom and exchange of prisoners. According to tradition, Fabricius so impressed Pyrrhus by refusing to accept a bribe that the king released the prisoners without ransom. As a further example of his unshakable integrity, Fabricius was reported to have suppressed a plot to poison Pyrrhus. The Roman general negotiated a peace with Pyrrhus in 275 and later won a series of victories over the Samnites, Lucanians, and Bruttians. As censor in 275, he used his authority to expel from the Senate Publius Cornelius Rufinus, a patrician former consul, for possessing 10 pounds (4.5 kg) of silver tableware. This was one of the first times a censor used his power to expel for ethical reasons. He survived in Roman memory as a model of the frugality and integrity of the men of old.
