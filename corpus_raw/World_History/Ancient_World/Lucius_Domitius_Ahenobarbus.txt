Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus,  (born 98—died 48 bc, Pharsalus, Macedonia [now Fársala, Greece]), a leader of the Optimates (conservative senatorial aristocracy) in the last years of the Roman Republic.
Ahenobarbus repeatedly resisted the designs of the powerful politicians and generals Julius Caesar, Pompey the Great, and Marcus Crassus, who in 60 bc combined to control elections and legislation. (Some modern writers, but no ancient sources, call this combination the First Triumvirate.) In 58 Ahenobarbus unsuccessfully tried to prosecute Caesar. Then, as candidate for the consulship of 55, he pledged to remove Caesar from the command in Gaul. In response to this threat, the three dynasts decided to make Pompey and Crassus consuls for that year. Ahenobarbus had to wait until 54; then, as consul with Appius Claudius Pulcher, he got involved in an election scandal that shocked Rome.
In January 49, after Pompey had broken with Caesar, the Senate outlawed Caesar and appointed Ahenobarbus to replace him in Gaul. Caesar then crossed the Rubicon and marched on Rome, precipitating the civil war of 49–45. Against the advice of Pompey, Ahenobarbus attempted to stop the invading army at Corfinium in central Italy (present-day Corfinio), but he was defeated and captured by Caesar. Almost as soon as Ahenobarbus was released on a promise not to continue fighting, he organized armed resistance against Caesar at Massilia (present-day Marseille), and managed to escape before the city fell. Ahenobarbus next joined the Pompeians in Greece and died trying to get away after their defeat at Pharsalus.
