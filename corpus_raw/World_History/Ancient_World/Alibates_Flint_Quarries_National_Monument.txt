Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument,  archaeological site in northwestern Texas, U.S. It lies 30 miles (48 km) north-northeast of Amarillo, near Borger. Lake Meredith National Recreation Area adjoins it to the north and west. Established in 1965 as Alibates Flint Quarries and Texas Panhandle Pueblo Culture National Monument, the monument was redesignated in 1978 with its current name and boundaries. It occupies an area of 2.1 square miles (5.5 square km).
The monument contains some 250 shallow quarry pits ranging in width from 4 to 8 feet (1.2 to 2.5 metres). Beginning about 12,000 years ago, native peoples of the Clovis complex began extracting the richly coloured and veined Alibates flint from dolomite outcrops in the Canadian River breaks to make projectile points and other sharp-edged tools. Native peoples continued to quarry flint until about 1870. The monument is also the site of several ruined dwellings built by the Plains Village Indians who inhabited the area from about 1150 to 1500 ce. Short prairie grasses are the dominant vegetation. Mule and white-tailed deer, coyotes, jackrabbits, and a variety of birds live in the area. The monument can be explored only on guided tours.
