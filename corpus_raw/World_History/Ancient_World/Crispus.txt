Crispus, in full Flavius Julius Crispus,  (born c. 305—died 326, Pola, Venetia), eldest son of Constantine the Great who was executed under mysterious circumstances on his father’s orders.
Crispus’s mother, Minerva (or Minervina), was divorced by Constantine in 307. Crispus received his education from the Christian writer Lactantius. On March 1, 317, Constantine gave Crispus the title of caesar and made him titular ruler of Gaul. He defeated the Franks in 320 and the Alamanni in 322 and 323. In the second war between Constantine and his co-emperor Licinius (324), Crispus commanded his father’s fleet and won an important naval victory in the Hellespont. But in 326, while accompanying Constantine to Rome to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his accession, he was put to death at Pola. Shortly afterward his stepmother, Fausta, was also executed.
