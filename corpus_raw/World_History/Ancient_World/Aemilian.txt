Aemilian, Latin in full Marcus Aemilius Aemilianus,  (born, Mauretania—died 253, near Spoletium, Umbria [Italy]), Roman emperor for three months in 253.
Aemilian was a senator and served as consul before receiving the command of the army of Moesia (in present eastern Yugoslavia) during the reign of the emperor Trebonianus Gallus (reigned 251–253). After turning back an invasion by the Goths, Aemilian rebelled against the emperor in the summer of 253 and invaded Italy. When Gallus was killed by his own troops, Aemilian became his successor. A few weeks later the Roman forces of the Upper Rhine declared their commander, Valerian, emperor. Before the two sides came to battle, Aemilian was assassinated by his troops near Spoletium. Despite his victory over the Goths, his attempt to seize power allowed the defeated Goths to regroup and invade Greece.
