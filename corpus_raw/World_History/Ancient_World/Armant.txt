Armant, Greek Hermonthis, Egyptian Per-month,  ancient town in Upper Egypt, near Thebes on the west bank of the Nile River. It was the seat of a sun cult and was a crowning place of kings. The war god Mont was worshiped there in hawk-headed human form and also in his epiphany, the bull Buchis. Armant was probably the original home of the rulers of Thebes who reunited Egypt after the First Intermediate Period (c. 2130–1938 bce). Excavations (1929–38) uncovered the Bucheum (the necropolis of the mummified Buchis bulls), cemeteries of various periods from the predynastic downward, and part of the town area, including the temple of Mont.
