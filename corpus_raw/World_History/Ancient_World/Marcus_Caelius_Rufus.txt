Marcus Caelius Rufus,  (born 88 bc, at Interamna [modern Teramo, Italy]—died  48, Thurii, Bruttium), Roman politician and close friend of Cicero. He is possibly also the Rufus whom the poet Catullus accused of stealing his mistress Clodia. At her instigation Caelius, who had deserted her, was prosecuted for vis (“violent acts”) in 56, but Cicero and Marcus Licinius Crassus spoke in Caelius’ defense and he was acquitted.
Caelius was educated under the guidance of Crassus and Cicero. In 58 he prosecuted Gaius Antonius Hybrida, who had been consul with Cicero in 63, and secured his conviction, although Hybrida was defended by Cicero. Caelius was tribune in 52 and aedile in 50. In his letters to Cicero, then governor of Cilicia, Caelius repeatedly but unsuccessfully asked for panthers so that the games he sponsored would be more impressive. He kept Cicero informed of events in Rome in a series of letters that survive.
In the Civil War of 49 Caelius sided with Julius Caesar against Pompey the Great and fought in northwestern Italy and Spain. He gained the office of praetor peregrinus (“judge of suits involving foreigners”) in 48 but quarreled violently with the urban praetor Gaius Trebonius and introduced measures amounting to a general cancellation of debts. Deprived of his office by the Senate, he left to join Titus Annius Milo in an insurrection in which both he and Milo were killed.
