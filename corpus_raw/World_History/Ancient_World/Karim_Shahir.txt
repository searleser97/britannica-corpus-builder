Kar朝m Shah朝r,  ancient mound located near the archaeological site of Jarmo in the hills of northeastern Iraq. Kar朝m Shah朝r is situated on a terrace at an elevation of approximately 2,600 feet (800 metres) near a small river. It has yielded artifacts that offer clear proof both of the knowledge of grain cultivation, in the form of sickle blades showing sheen from use, and of the baking of clay, in the form of lightly fired clay figurines. Mortars and pestles, animal bones, and a cobbled pseudo-pavement were also discovered there.
