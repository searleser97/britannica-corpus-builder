Shalmaneser V,  (flourished  8th century bc), king of Assyria (reigned 726–721 bc) who subjugated ancient Israel and undertook a punitive campaign to quell the rebellion of Israel’s king Hoshea (2 Kings 17).
None of his historical records survive, but the King List of Babylon, where he ruled as Ululai, links him with Tiglath-pileser III, whose son he may have been. When King Hoshea of Israel rebelled (2 Kings 17), Shalmaneser marched via Bit-Adini to besiege Samaria and attack Tyre. For three years he laid siege until “he broke the resistance of Shamaraʿin” (Samaria). However, he died shortly before the capture of the city, which was claimed by his successor, Sargon II.
