Dicastery,  a judicial body in ancient Athens. Dicasteries were divisions of the Heliaea from the time of the democratic reforms of Cleisthenes (c. 508â€“507 bc), when the Heliaea was transformed from an appellate court to a court with original jurisdiction. Each year 6,000 volunteers, who were required to be male citizens at least 30 years of age, were assigned by lot to sit on specific dicasteries, or court panels. Each group of about 500 dicasts (about 200 in matters of private law) constituted a court for the entire year. In more important cases, several dicasteries might be combined. The verdict was determined by majority vote; a tie vote acquitted.
Litigants usually spoke for themselves, though advocates could also speak on behalf of a defendant. Before c. 378 bc, evidence was presented orally; thereafter, a written brief was read before the court by its clerk. Once they had been determined, verdicts were not subject to appeal or revision. The presiding officer of the court supervised only procedural matters; the dicasts were judges of both law and fact and voted on the verdict without discussion among themselves.
The dicastery system has been defended on the grounds that the large number of dicasts provided solidarity against intimidation, lessened the chances of bribery, and made the administration of justice a more democratic process.
