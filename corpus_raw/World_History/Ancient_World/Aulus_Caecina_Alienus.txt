Aulus Caecina Alienus,  (born, Vicetia, Venetia [now Vicenza, Italy]—died ad 79),  Roman general who, during the civil wars of 69, played a decisive role in making first Aulus Vitellius and then Vespasian rulers of the empire.
As a quaestor (financial administrator) in Spain, Caecina aided the successful revolt of Servius Sulpicius Galba, governor of Nearer Spain, against the emperor Nero in 68. After Galba was made emperor (ruled June 68 to January 69), Caecina served as a legate in Upper Germany until Galba had him prosecuted for embezzlement. Caecina then sided with Vitellius, who had been proclaimed emperor by the troops of Upper and Lower Germany. In January 69 Galba was killed, and Marcus Salvius Otho was made emperor. Otho’s forces were crushed by Caecina and Fabius Valens at Bedriacum (near Cremona) in April, and Otho committed suicide.
Vitellius, recognized as emperor, made Caecina consul and sent him to face Vespasian’s invading troops. Caecina was imprisoned by his troops when he tried unsuccessfully to persuade them to change sides and join Vespasian; they were defeated by Vespasian’s army at Bedriacum (October 69). Caecina was sent to Vespasian, who befriended and honoured him but gave him no active command. In 79 he took part in a conspiracy against Vespasian. The emperor’s son Titus, in his capacity as praetorian prefect, had Caecina executed.
