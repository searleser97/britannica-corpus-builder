Demaratus,  (flourished  5th century bc), king of Sparta, together with Cleomenes I, who frustrated Cleomenes’ designs on both Athens and Aegina. He was consequently dethroned by Cleomenes on a false charge of illegitimacy, upon which he fled to Persia and was given some small cities in northwestern Asia Minor, which his descendants held in Xenophon’s time. The historian Herodotus told several stories of Demaratus’ advice and warnings to Xerxes, whom he accompanied on his expedition to Greece in 480.
