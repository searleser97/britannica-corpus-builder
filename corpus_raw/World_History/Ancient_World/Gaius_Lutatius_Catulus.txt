Gaius Lutatius Catulus,  (flourished  3rd century bc), Roman commander, victor in the final battle of the First Punic War between Rome and Carthage (264â€“241). As consul in 242, he blockaded the Sicilian cities of Lilybaeum and Drepanum with a fleet of 200 ships. On March 10, 241, the Carthaginian relieving fleet was totally defeated near the Aegates Islands off western Sicily. Catulus, who had made the decision to attack, shared in the triumph, though a wound had prevented him from taking part in the operations.
