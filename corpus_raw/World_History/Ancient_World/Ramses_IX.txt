Ramses IX, Ramses also spelled Ramesses or Rameses,  (flourished 12th century bce), king of ancient Egypt (reigned 1126–08 bce), during whose reign serious civil problems troubled Egypt.
Amenhotep, the high priest of Amon, exercised many religious and governmental functions in Thebes while Ramses IX remained almost continuously at his capital in the Nile River delta. Libyan marauders from two tribes began disturbing the Theban region in the eighth year of his reign, and five years later they caused work stoppages in western Thebes; later they actually penetrated eastern Thebes. The government’s failure to pay several months’ rations to the necropolis staff in western Thebes led the poorer workmen to plunder tombs, and the price of grain, though down slightly from its peak levels under Ramses IX’s predecessor, remained high.
Through all these difficulties Ramses IX still controlled Nubia, despite maintaining his own residence apparently chiefly in the delta. Although a 19-year reign has been suggested for him, no incidents of his last two years have been recorded.
