Proconsul, Latin Pro Consule, or Proconsul,  in the ancient Roman Republic, a consul whose powers had been extended for a definite period after his regular term of one year. From the mid-4th century bc the Romans recognized the necessity, during lengthy wars, of extending the terms of certain magistrates; such extension was termed prorogatio. Initially prorogation was voted by the people, but soon the Senate assumed this power. As Rome acquired more overseas territories, prorogation became more common: provincial governors were almost always prorogued magistrates or proconsuls. By the middle republic proconsular powers were sometimes conferred upon private citizens, for example, on Pompey in 77, 66, and 65 bc. Under the empire (after 27 bc), governors of senatorial provinces were called proconsuls. In modern times the title has been used informally of certain powerful colonial officials (e.g., the consul general of British-occupied Egypt).
