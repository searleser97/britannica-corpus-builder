Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus,  (born 102—died 48 bc), Roman politician who, as consul with Julius Caesar in 59 bc, worked with the senatorial conservatives against Caesar’s agrarian legislation. He was married to Porcia, a daughter of Cato the Younger.
When Bibulus was prevented by mob violence from opposing Caesar’s agrarian legislation in the Forum, he tried to stop its enactment by announcing that he would be watching the heavens for omens for the rest of the year. Technically, it could be held that this announcement should bring all elections and legislation to a standstill. Caesar, however, ignored the announcement as of doubtful legality. Bibulus retired to his house and did not emerge for the rest of his consulship. His only public acts were edicts against Caesar’s proceedings.
In 52 he voted in favour of a sole consulship for Pompey the Great. In 51–50 Bibulus was governor of Cilicia and resisted a Parthian invasion; he was awarded a triumph for a minor success. During the Civil War between Pompey and Caesar, Pompey gave Bibulus the command of a fleet in the Ionian Sea. Bibulus failed to prevent Caesar from crossing from Italy to Epirus with his army in the midwinter of 49, but he later succeeded in cutting Caesar off from Italy. He died a natural death soon after.
