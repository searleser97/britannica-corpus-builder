Lewis R. Binford, in full Lewis Roberts Binford,  (born Nov. 21, 1931, Norfolk, Va., U.S.—died April 11, 2011, Kirksville, Mo.), American archaeologist. Binford taught principally at the University of New Mexico (1968–91) and later at Southern Methodist University (1991–2003). In the mid-1960s he initiated what came to be known as the “New Archaeology,” which champions the use of quantitative methods and the practice of archaeology as a rigorous science. He applied the new methodology in an influential study of Mousterian artifacts and later extended it to a study of the hunting activities of a living people, the Nunamiut, trying to draw analogies to prehistoric contexts.
