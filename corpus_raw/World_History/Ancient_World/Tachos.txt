Tachos, also called Takhor, Teos, or Zedhor,  second king (reigned 365â€“360 bc) of the 30th dynasty of Egypt; he led an unsuccessful attack on the Persians in Phoenicia. Tachos was aided in the undertaking by the aged Spartan king Agesilaus II, who led a body of Greek mercenaries, and by the Athenian fleet commander Chabrias. Tachos, however, insisted on leading the Egyptian army himself, and Agesilaus, after quarreling with his ally, supported a military revolt in Egypt that placed the young pretender Nectanebo II on the throne. Tachos fled to Iran, where he died an exile.
