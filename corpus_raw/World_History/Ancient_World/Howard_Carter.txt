Howard Carter,  (born May 9, 1874, Swaffham, Norfolk, England—died March 2, 1939, London), British archaeologist, who made one of the richest and most-celebrated contributions to Egyptology: the discovery (1922) of the largely intact tomb of King Tutankhamen.
At age 17 Carter joined the British-sponsored archaeological survey of Egypt. He made drawings (1893–99) of the sculptures and inscriptions at the terraced temple of Queen Hatshepsut in ancient Thebes. He next served as inspector general of the Egyptian antiquities department. While supervising excavations in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings in 1902, he discovered the tombs of Hatshepsut and Thutmose IV.
About 1907 he began his association with the 5th earl of Carnarvon, a collector of antiquities who had sought out Carter to supervise excavations in the valley. On November 4, 1922, Carter found the first sign of what proved to be Tutankhamen’s tomb, but it was not until November 26 that a second sealed doorway was reached, behind which were the treasures. Carter’s diary captured the drama of the moment. After making a tiny hole in the doorway, Carter, with candle in hand, peered into the tomb.
For the next 10 years Carter supervised the removal of its contents, most of which are housed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. He published Thoutmôsis IV (1904) and The Tomb of Tut-ankh-Amen (1923–33) with, respectively, P.E. Newberry and A.C. Mace. An account of the Tutankhamen excavation may be found in C.W. Ceram’s Gods, Graves & Scholars (2nd rev. and enlarged ed., 1994).
