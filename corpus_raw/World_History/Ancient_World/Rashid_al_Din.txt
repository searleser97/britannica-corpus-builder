Rashīd al-Dīn,  (born 1247—died 1318), Persian statesman and historian who was the author of a universal history, Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh (“Collector of Chronicles”).
Rashīd al-Dīn belonged to a Jewish family of Hamadan, but he was converted to Islam and, as a physician, joined the court of the Mongol ruler of Persia, the Il-Khan Abagha (1265–82). He became vizier to Maḥmūd Ghāzān in 1298 and served under his successor Öljeitü. Accused by his rivals of having poisoned his sovereign, he was put to death by Öljeitü’s son Abū Saʿīd.
Rashīd al-Dīn’s history covers a vast field even outside the Muslim world. His sources of information were, for Mongolia and China, high officials of the Mongol empire and the Mongol records; for India, a Buddhist from Kashmir; and, for the popes and emperors, a Catholic monk. There are important chapters describing the social and economic conditions of the Islamic countries under Ghāzān (1295–1304) and the reforms introduced by this ruler on the advice of the author himself. Rashīd al-Dīn uses a great number of Mongol and Turkish terms, but his style is lucid and matter-of-fact.
