Quintus Fabius Pictor,  (flourished c. 200 bc), one of the first Roman prose historians, an important source for later writers.
A member of the Senate, Fabius fought against the Carthaginians in the Second Punic War (218–201) and was sent on a mission to the oracle of Delphi after the disastrous Roman defeat at Cannae (216). His history, now lost, was an account of the development of Rome from the earliest times. Fabius wrote it in Greek, partly because he sought to justify Roman policy to the Greeks. The later historians Polybius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Livy all used Fabius’ work as a source. Fabius (under the name Pictorinus) is one of the Greek historians who was listed on the walls of the ancient school at Taormina, Sicily.
