Marcus Livius Drusus,  (died 109 bc), Roman politician, tribune with Gaius Gracchus in 122 bc who undermined Gracchus’ program of economic and political reform by proposing reforms that were even more appealing to the populace but that he evidently did not seriously intend to be implemented. On the issue of colonization Drusus went further than Gracchus by proposing the immediate foundation in Italy and Sicily of 12 colonies to be settled by citizens without property qualifications. He proposed, in addition, that all land that had been distributed since the passage of Tiberius Gracchus’ agrarian reform bill should be rent free.
By pressing for immunity from corporal punishment (even during military service), Drusus was promising the Latins more protection from abuses by Roman magistrates than even Roman citizens enjoyed. This was a skillful measure since many Latins preferred protection from the magistrates to all the privileges that Roman citizenship would confer. Although a commission was set up to carry out these Leges Livianae, the laws probably were not implemented. The principal effect of Drusus’ proposals was to win votes away from Gaius Gracchus, who was defeated in his third bid for the tribunate (for 121).
Drusus was consul in 112 and became governor of Macedonia, where he campaigned successfully against the Scordisci tribe. On his return he celebrated a triumph in 110 and, as censor in 109, died in office.
