Tiglath-pileser I,   (flourished 11th century bc), one of the greatest of the early kings of Assyria (reigned c. 1115â€“c. 1077 bc).
Tiglath-pileser ascended the throne at the time when a people known as the Mushki, or Mushku (Meshech of the Old Testament), probably Phrygians, were thrusting into Asia Minor (now Turkey). Their invasion constituted a serious threat to Middle Eastern civilization because Asia Minor was the principal source of iron, which was then coming into general use. Tiglath-pileser defeated 20,000 Mushki in the Assyrian province of Kummukh (Commagene). He also defeated the Nairi, who lived west of Lake Van, extending Assyrian control farther into Asia Minor than any of his predecessors had done. He subdued various seminomadic Aramaean tribes living along the routes to the Mediterranean and reached the Syrian coast, where the Phoenician trading cities paid him tribute. Egypt, closely linked by trade with the Syrian coast, made overtures of friendship. After 1100 Tiglath-pileser conquered northern Babylonia.
Tiglath-pileser I carried out extensive building work in Ashur, Nineveh, and other cities, and texts from his library are still extant. His territorial conquests, however, did not outlast his reign, and after his death Assyria entered a period of decline.
