Tang, Wade-Giles romanization T’ang, personal name (xingming) Zi Lü, temple name (miaohao) Taiyi, also called Chengtang, or Tianyi,  (flourished  17th–16th century? bc), reign name of the Chinese emperor who overthrew the Xia dynasty (c. 2070–c. 1600 bc) and founded the Shang, the first historical dynasty ( c. 1600–1046 bc, though the dating of the Shang—and hence also of the Tang emperor’s founding of it—have long been the subject of much debate).
As a historical figure, Tang was apparently a scion of a noble family. According to legend, he was a descendant of the mythical sage-king Huangdi (the “Yellow Emperor”). Tang is also said to have revolted against the evil last ruler of the Xia dynasty after reading on the shell of a tortoise a prophecy that he would do so.
Revered as a humane and generous ruler, Tang is said to have offered himself as a sacrifice to Heaven during a drought. Rain fell before the ceremony ended, however, and he was spared. He is usually represented as a nine-foot-tall, white-faced, whiskered man with a pointed head, six-jointed arms, and a body markedly larger on one side than on the other.
