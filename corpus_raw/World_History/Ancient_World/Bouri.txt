Bouri,  site of paleoanthropological excavations in the Awash River valley in the Afar region of Ethiopia, best known for its 2.5-million-year-old remains of Australopithecus garhi. Animal bones found there show cut marksâ€”some of the earliest evidence of stone tool use in the record of human evolution.
The skull of A. garhi found at Bouri resembles that of the earlier species A. afarensis in many respects, but it possesses other traits typical of later hominins (members of the human lineage). Such a mix of features is also observed in other species and is considered evidence that human evolution involved numerous bipedal experiments and extinctions.
The Bouri site also contains fossils that are approximately one million years old, including a well-preserved cranium of Homo erectus with a brain size more than twice that of A. garhi. Early Acheulean industry stone tools are abundant. Animal fossils found at the site indicate an open grassland environment. There are also deposits approximately 250,000 years in age that contain archaic Homo fossils and late Acheulean tools.
