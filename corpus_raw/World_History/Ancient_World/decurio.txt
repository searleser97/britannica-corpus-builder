Decurio, plural decuriones,  in ancient Rome, the head of a group of 10. The title had two applications, one civil, the other military. In the first usage decurio was applied to a member of the local council or senate of a colonia (a community established by Roman citizens and having full citizenship rights) or a municipium (a corporation and community established by non-Romans but granted certain rights of citizenship). Qualifications were numerous, and the position was regarded as an honour. The decuriones had wide powers in local administration, finance, and judiciary proceedings.
From the 3rd century ad, when prosperity declined and the demands of the central government increased, responsibility for tax collection and liability for deficits gradually made their position difficult. It became a hereditary and compulsory service for the class that became known as curiales. Members of the class increasingly sought exemption from the formerly honourable position. Exemption was granted to members of the senatorial and equestrian orders, doctors, professors, wheat merchants, those in charge of state lands and collecting taxes, and a few other categories. Beginning in the reign of Diocletian (284–305), the imperial government took a role in discouraging the evasion of decurial duties. In the time of Constantine I (sole ruler, 324–337), the minimum age was lowered from 25 to 18. No efforts succeeded in preventing the shrinking of the eligible population, however.
In the army a decurio was an officer in command of a squadron of cavalry. He was also the officer in charge of headquarters troops.
