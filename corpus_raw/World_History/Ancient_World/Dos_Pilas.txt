Dos Pilas,  ancient capital of the Petexbatún kingdom of the Maya, situated near the Salinas River in what is now Petén, west-central Guatemala, about 5 miles (8 km) east of the border with Mexico. At the height of its hegemony the kingdom covered an area of some 1,500 square miles (3,885 square km).
At the turn of the 21st century, archaeologists were still piecing together the history of Dos Pilas. Excavations at the Dos Pilas site in 1991 revealed the tomb of a king—as yet known only as Ruler 2 (reigned c. 698–725). Further work in 2001 and 2002 exposed glyphs on a stairway that have resulted in a major revision of scholarly opinion regarding the decline of Mayan civilization about ad 900. The writing gives evidence that Dos Pilas was founded about ad 629, notes the birth of the man who became Ruler I, and marks the several ceremonial events of his life. Glyphs on other portions of the Dos Pilas structure note an attack on the city by Calakmul, another centre of power, and seem to indicate family infighting that turned fatal. These discoveries have led scholars to believe that wars fought for control of the commercial river and land trade routes and the disruption of these may have caused the sudden decline of the Maya.
