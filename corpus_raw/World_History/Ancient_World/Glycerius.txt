Glycerius,  (flourished  5th century), Western Roman emperor from 473 to 474.
Glycerius was made emperor on March 5, 473, by Gundobad, the nephew and successor of the powerful Western general and kingmaker Ricimer (died 472). At the time of his appointment four months had lapsed since the death of his predecessor, the emperor Olybrius (ruled April–November 472). Glycerius was not recognized as a legitimate ruler by the Eastern emperor, Leo I, who sent a fleet commanded by Julius Nepos against him. Nepos landed near Rome and proclaimed himself emperor. Glycerius surrendered without a struggle and was appointed bishop of Salonae (near modern Split, Croatia), but in 480 he helped engineer the assassination of Nepos. The most important achievement of Glycerius’ reign was the diversion to Gaul of a threatened Ostrogothic invasion of Italy.
