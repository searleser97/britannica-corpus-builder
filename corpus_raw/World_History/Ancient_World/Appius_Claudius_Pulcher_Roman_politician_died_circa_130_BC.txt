Appius Claudius Pulcher,  (died c. 130 bc), Roman politician, father-in-law of the agrarian reformer Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus. Claudius served on the Gracchan land commission from 133 until his death. He was consul in 143 and censor in 136. His prestige as princeps senatus (“senior senator”) enabled him to provide powerful support for Gracchus’ cause and to escape the violence that in 133 destroyed the reformer and many of his followers.
