Gaius Trebonius,  (died 43 bc), Roman general and politician who had been one of Caesar’s most trusted lieutenants before becoming a member of the conspiracy that resulted in Caesar’s death.
During his term as quaestor (financial magistrate) about 60 bc, Trebonius opposed Publius Clodius. Five years later he backed Caesar’s party. As tribune of the plebs, he was the author of an act that granted Spain to Pompey and Syria to Marcus Licinius Crassus for an additional five years and allowed these two consuls to recruit soldiers both in Italy and in the provinces. After Trebonius served as Caesar’s legate in the conquest of Gaul and the Roman Civil War, Caesar in 48 rewarded him with a praetorship and in 49 with the governorship of Further Spain. Trebonius soon abandoned Spain, however, following a mutiny of his troops. In 45 Caesar made him consul and promised him the governorship of Asia, but Trebonius joined the conspiracy against Caesar; he participated in Caesar’s assassination by keeping Mark Antony out of the building where the act took place. Trebonius was appointed proconsul in Asia in 44. He was murdered the next year at Smyrna by the governor of Syria, Publius Cornelius Dolabella.
