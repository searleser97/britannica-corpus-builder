Gaius Duilius,  (flourished  3rd century bc), Roman commander who won a major naval victory over the Carthaginians during the First Punic War (264–241 bc).
As consul in 260, Duilius was in charge of the army in Sicily when he was assigned to command Rome’s newly created fleet. Realizing that his forces lacked skill in naval warfare, he decided that they must fight under conditions as similar as possible to those of a land engagement. Hence, he invented boarding bridges fitted with grappling irons (corvi). With these devices he decisively defeated the Carthaginian fleet off Mylae (present-day Milazzo) on the north coast of Sicily. He celebrated a triumph at Rome that was the first naval triumph in Roman history. His victory was commemorated by a column in the Roman Forum decorated with the beaks (i.e., metal beams originally projecting from the bows and used to pierce enemy vessels) of captured Carthaginian ships. Called the columna rostrata, it was a favourite site for speeches. The English term rostrum derives from this Roman custom. In 258 Duilius was censor (magistrate responsible for the census and for public morality), and in 231 he was empowered (as a magistrate with emergency powers, or a dictator) by the Senate to hold elections.
