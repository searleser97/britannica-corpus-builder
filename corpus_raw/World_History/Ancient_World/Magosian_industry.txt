Magosian industry,  stone-tool technology in which an advanced Levallois technique was employed for the production of flakes for the manufacture of other tools, together with a punch technique for the production of microlithic artifacts. Projectile points were produced by pressure flaking.
The site for which the industry is named is located in northern Uganda. Other sites in central and southern Africa that are dated to the Pleistocene Epoch (i.e., about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) are often considered to represent the same material culture and hunting-and-gathering adaptation.
