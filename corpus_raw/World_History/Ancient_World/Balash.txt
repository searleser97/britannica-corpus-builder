Balāsh, also spelled Valākhsh,  (flourished 5th century), Sāsānian king (reigned 484–488), succeeding his brother Fīrūz I. Soon after he ascended the throne, Balāsh was threatened by the dominance of invading Hephthalites, a nomadic eastern tribe. Supported by Zarmihr, a feudal chief, Balāsh suppressed an uprising by his rebel brother Zareh. Later, however, he was abandoned by Zarmihr, and shortly afterward he was deposed and blinded. The crown was given to a son of Fīrūz, Kavadh I.
