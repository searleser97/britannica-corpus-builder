Demosthenes,  (died 413 bc), Athenian general who proved to be an imaginative strategist during the Peloponnesian War (Athens versus Sparta, 431â€“404).
In 426 he unsuccessfully besieged the Corinthian colony of Leukas and was severely defeated in an attempted invasion of Aetolia. Demosthenes redeemed these failures by successfully defending Naupactus, the Athenian naval base in the Gulf of Corinth, against a Spartan land attack and by winning two decisive victories over the Spartans, at Olpae near Argos and at Idomene in the hills to the north of Argos. In 425 he was authorized to use the fleet for operations around the Peloponnese. He fortified the promontory of Pylos in Messenia and, while the rest of the flotilla sailed on to Sicily, remained with five ships at the harbour of the peninsula at Pylos. There he managed to resist Spartan attacks. The Spartans occupied the neighbouring peninsula of Sphacteria but were besieged after their ships were driven off by the returning Athenian fleet. The politician Cleon joined Demosthenes in defeating and capturing the stranded foe.
In 424 Demosthenes made an abortive attack on Megara and launched an unsuccessful invasion of Boeotia. In 413 he was sent to reinforce the general Nicias during the Athenian siege of Syracuse. Failing in a night attack on the high ground overlooking the city, Demosthenes advised immediate retreat but was overruled by Nicias. When the retreat finally began, the division under Demosthenes fell behind and was forced to surrender. Demosthenes was put to death by his captors.
