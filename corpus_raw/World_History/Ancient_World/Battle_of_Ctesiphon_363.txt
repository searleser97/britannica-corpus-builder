Battle of Ctesiphon,  (363). Julian, the young hero of Argentoratum, badly overplayed his hand a few years later when he tackled Shapur II’s Sassanid Persian forces. The Romans won on the battlefield, but then faced a Persian scorched-earth policy. The campaign ended with the Roman army exhausted and demoralized, and Julian dead.
Julian, now emperor, was an attractive, charismatic figure: a man who lived his life on a heroic scale, a reckless romantic in search of striking gestures and epic triumphs. How else to explain the Persian campaign of 363 when, conscious of his weakness, Shapur II had already sued for peace? And what of Julian’s decision, on reaching the Persian capital Ctesiphon after sailing up the Tigris, quite literally to burn his boats?
The Persian army awaiting the Romans outside the city was an intimidating sight: long lines of cataphracts (armored cavalry), their weaponry glinting in the sun. Undaunted, though, Julian had his cavalry form a crescent, the wings enveloping the enemy. The Romans gained an unexpected victory, but Julian’s siege engines had gone up in flames with his fleet. There was no way that he could hope to lay siege to Ctesiphon. Instead, he decided to strike deep into Persia, from where Shapur was advancing with another army. Harried by the Persians, who had burned all the crops, the Romans were soon hungry and morale was low. The Persians were happy to avoid a head-on clash.
Julian decided to withdraw, sweeping around northward into Anatolia, but the Persian attacks continued, and, in one of these—at Samsarra—he was mortally wounded. His army limped home, decimated by starvation, disease, and enemy attack: never had a "victorious" army returned in so forlorn a state.
Losses: Roman, 70; Persian, 2,500.
