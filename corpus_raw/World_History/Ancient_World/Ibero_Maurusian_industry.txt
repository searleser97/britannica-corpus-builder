Ibero-Maurusian industry, also called Oranian Industry,  North African stone-tool industry dating from the late Würm (last) Glacial Period, about 16,000 years ago. The former presumption that the industry extended into Spain explains the prefix “Ibero-” in the name. The industry does bear a close resemblance to the late Magdalenian culture in Spain, which is broadly contemporary (c. 15,000 bc). Subsequent study, however, suggests that the Ibero-Maurusian industry is derived from a Nile River valley culture known as Halfan, which dates from about 17,000 bc. Human remains are rather frequently associated with Ibero-Maurusian artifacts, and it appears that the industry belonged to a group of people known as the Mechta-el-Arbi race, considered to have been a North African branch of Cro-Magnon man.
The Ibero-Maurusian industry, much more widespread than the Mesolithic Capsian industry (8000–2700 bc), is found along the entire coastline of North Africa and inland as well as in Morocco, Tunisia, and the Cyrenaica (Barqah) region of Libya. It is characterized by a great many small-backed blades and, unlike the Capsian, an absence of burins (a sort of chisel, probably used for working wood).
