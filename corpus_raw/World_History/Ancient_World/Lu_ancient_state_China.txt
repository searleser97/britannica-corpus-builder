Lu, Wade-Giles romanization Lu,  one of the vassal states of ancient China that originated during the Xi (Western) Zhou dynasty but came to prominence in the Warring States (Zhanguo) period (475–221 bc) of the Dong (Eastern) Zhou. One of the smaller of the warring states, Lu is known as the birthplace of Confucius (551–479 bc). The famous Chunqiu (“Spring and Autumn [Annals]”) is a chronological record of the major events that occurred at the court of the state of Lu between 722 and 481 bc. For almost 2,000 years this work has been revered as one of the great Chinese Classics, mainly because it has been claimed that Confucius edited the work. As a result of the continued interest in the Chunqiu, more is known about Lu than about most of the other states of the period.
The rulers of Lu, which was located in the southwestern portion of the present Chinese province of Shandong, traced their ancestry back to the founders of the Xi Zhou (mid-11th century bc). It is thought that Lu began as a vassal state of the Zhou; Lu rulers continued to acknowledge the traditions and customs of the Xi Zhou court as late as the time of Confucius. It was in this milieu that Confucius developed his teachings that the solution to the problems of the present was for men to return to the wisdom of the past. The rulers of Lu, however, did not heed Confucius’s advice and never employed him in a responsible government position. In 249 bc the state was finally extinguished by Zhu, one of the larger of the warring kingdoms then fighting for supremacy in China.
