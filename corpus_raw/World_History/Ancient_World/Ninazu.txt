Ninazu,  in Mesopotamian religion, Sumerian deity, the city god of Enegir, which was located on the Euphrates River between Larsa and Ur in the southern orchard region. Ninazu was also the city god of Eshnunna (modern Tall al-Asmar in eastern Iraq). Ninazu, whose name means “Water Knower,” was primarily an underworld deity, although the exact nature of his character or functions is not clear. In Enegir he was considered the son of Ereshkigal, goddess of the netherworld; according to another tradition, however, he was the son of Enlil and Ninlil (Belit). His spouse was Ningirda, a daughter of Enki (Ea).
