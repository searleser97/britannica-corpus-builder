Publius Clodius Thrasea Paetus,  (died ad 66), Roman senator who was famous for his opposition to the emperor Nero.
Thrasea was consul in 56 and took an independent line on various occasions in Nero’s reign; he walked out when the Senate congratulated Nero on his mother’s death (59); out of disgust with Nero’s immoralities, he retired altogether from public life from 63 to 66. In 66 his enemies persuaded Nero to order Thrasea’s death on the ground that he had become almost the head of a rival party in the state; in fact there is no evidence that he ever would have carried opposition to the point of conspiracy. He spent his last hours in a discussion of the immortality of the soul with his son-in-law, Helvidius Priscus; the cynic philosopher Demetrius; and his wife, Arria, whom he persuaded not to follow him in suicide. Thrasea Paetus wrote a biography of Cato the Younger, who had committed suicide rather than submit to Julius Caesar’s rule; the work became a source for Plutarch’s 2nd-century biography of Cato.
