Lucius Afranius,  (born, Picenum [Italy]—died  46 bc, Africa province [now in Tunisia]), Roman general, a devoted adherent of Pompey the Great.
Afranius’s hometown, Picenum, was a Pompeian stronghold. He served under Pompey against Sertorius and then held a praetorship and a command in a Gallic province, where he earned a triumph. He again served under Pompey as a legate against Mithradates VI. In 60 bc he was consul, as Pompey’s candidate, but he did not succeed in defending Pompey’s interests. In 55 bc Pompey, as consul, was assigned Spain as a province and sent Afranius and Marcus Petreius to govern it for him as legates. They were still there when civil war broke out between Caesar and Pompey in 49 bc.
When Caesar invaded Spain, they were compelled to surrender to him at Ilerda (49 bc). Caesar dismissed them on their promise not to serve again in the war. Afranius, however, went to join Pompey, and, at the Battle of Pharsalus (48 bc), he had charge of Pompey’s camp. On Pompey’s defeat, Afranius, despairing of pardon from Caesar, went to Africa; he took part in the Battle of Thapsus (46 bc), at which Caesar defeated the supporters of Pompey and gained control of Roman Africa. Although he escaped from the field with a strong body of cavalry, Afranius was afterward taken prisoner and was killed (according to varying accounts) either by seditious soldiers or at the command of Caesar.
