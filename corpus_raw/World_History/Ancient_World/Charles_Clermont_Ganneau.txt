Charles Clermont-Ganneau,  (born Feb. 19, 1846, Paris—died  Feb. 15, 1923, Paris), French archaeologist who contributed to biblical studies and also exposed a number of archaeological frauds.
Clermont-Ganneau pursued his archaeological investigations while holding various diplomatic posts. A notable event in biblical research was his identification of the site of the ancient Canaanite city of Gezer, near modern Lod (Lydda), Israel (1873–74). He also directed expeditions to Syria (1881), Crete (1895), and Elephantine (Jazīrat Aswān), Egypt (1906–08). Equipped with an excellent knowledge of the languages of western Asia, he improved the translation of important Phoenician, Aramaic, and other ancient texts and became professor of archaeology and Oriental epigraphy at the Collège de France (1890). Among the frauds he exposed was the “biblical manuscript” acquired by the British Museum in 1883. His publications include Études d’archéologie orientale, 2 vol. (1880–97; “Studies in Eastern Archaeology”).
