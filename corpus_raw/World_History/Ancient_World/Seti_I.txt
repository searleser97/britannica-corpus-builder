Seti I,  (died 1279 bce), ancient Egyptian king of the 19th dynasty (1292–1190 bce) who reigned from 1290 to 1279 bce. His father, Ramses I, reigned only two years, and it was Seti who was the real founder of the greatness of the Ramessids.
In the early years of his reign, Seti led his army northward to restore Egyptian prestige, which had been partly lost during the troubled years of the late 18th dynasty. He battled in northern Palestine and Syria and fought at least one battle with the Hittite king Muwatallis; he subsequently concluded a peace treaty that may have established the frontier at Kadesh on the Orontes River between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountains.
Seti did much to promote the prosperity of Egypt. He fortified the frontier, opened mines and quarries, dug wells, and rebuilt temples and shrines that had fallen into decay or been damaged; and he continued the work begun by his father on the construction of the great hypostyle hall at Karnak, which is one of the most impressive monuments of Egyptian architecture. Another important work is his memorial temple at Abydos, which he dedicated to Osiris and six other deities and decorated with reliefs of great delicacy on which much of the original colour remains. Behind this temple is a curious building dedicated to Osiris. Seti’s tomb is the finest in the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes.
Although his son Ramses II is more famous, Seti is thought by many scholars to have been the greatest king of the 19th dynasty.
