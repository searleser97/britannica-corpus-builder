Wei Yuan, Wade-Giles romanization Wei Yüan,  (born April 23, 1794, Shaoyang, Hunan province, China—died March 26, 1857, Hangzhou, Zhejiang province), historian and geographer of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911/12).
Wei was a leader in the Statecraft school, which attempted to combine traditional scholarly knowledge with practical experience to find workable solutions to the problems plaguing the Chinese government. In 1826 he published the Huangchao jingshi wenbian (“Collected Essays on Statecraft Under the Reigning Dynasty”), a study of political and economic issues. It inspired a series of similar anthologies aimed at making the ideas of officials on governmental problems readily accessible.
In 1844 Wei published his best-known work, the Haiguo tuzhi (“Illustrated Gazetteer of the Countries Overseas”), on the geography and material conditions of foreign nations. Although handicapped by the ignorance and superstition with which the Chinese viewed the West, this work was the first to make use of translations from Western sources. Wei proposed that the Chinese learn the superior technology of the barbarians (in his day, Westerners seeking trading rights) so as to be strong enough to deal actively with their challenges. This idea provided the justification for the reform of the Chinese state attempted in the 1860s and ’70s, when its leaders finally began to introduce Western devices and technology into China.
