Saxon Dynasty, also called Liudolfing Dynasty,  ruling house of German kings (Holy Roman emperors) from 919 to 1024. It came to power when the Liudolfing duke of Saxony was elected German king as Henry I (later called the Fowler), in 919.
Henry I’s son and successor, Otto I the Great (king 936–973, western emperor from 962), won a decisive victory over the Magyars at the Battle of Lechfeld near Augsburg in 955 and continued the policy, initiated by Henry I, of German expansion into Slavic territory to the east; he also intervened in Italy and, like several of his successors, established control over the papacy. By investing churchmen in Germany with lands, he laid down a long-lasting framework of support for the crown against the lay nobility. He was crowned emperor by Pope John XII at Rome in 962. He concluded the Privilegium Ottonianum, a treaty that regulated relations between emperor and pope, and initiated a Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. His son Otto II (973–83) continued his policy, but his grandson Otto III (983–1002) was interested in Italian affairs to the detriment of Germany.
The last member of the line, Henry II (1002–24), turned his attention back to Germany. When Henry II died childless in 1024, another descendant of Henry I, Conrad II, the Salian, was elected king, thus initiating the Salian dynasty.
