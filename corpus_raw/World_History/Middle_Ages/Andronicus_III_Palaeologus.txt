Andronicus III Palaeologus, also spelled Andronikos III Palaiologos,  (born March 25, 1297, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]â€”died June 15, 1341, Constantinople), Byzantine emperor who sought to strengthen the empire during its final period of decline.
Andronicus was the grandson of the emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus, but his youthful excesses cost him the favour of his grandfather, and, after he accidentally caused the death of his brother in 1320, the emperor excluded him from the succession. A civil war ensued, with the younger Andronicus enlisting the support of the powerful Byzantine nobility, particularly the wealthy John VI Cantacuzenus; in 1325 Andronicus compelled the old emperor to recognize him as coemperor, with control over the provinces of Thrace and Macedonia. In May 1328, after forcing his grandfather to abdicate and enter a monastery, he became sole ruler.
As emperor, he relied heavily on the guidance of Cantacuzenus, who encouraged reform of the law courts and initiated the rebuilding of the imperial navy, which had been neglected in the reign of Andronicus II; Cantacuzenus himself became emperor in 1347. Also under Andronicus III, the Orthodox monasteries took a more active role in both ecclesiastical and civil affairs. In foreign policy Andronicus was forced to recognize Serbian suzerainty over Macedonia (1334) and suffered losses to the Ottoman Turks in Anatolia; but he managed to regain the islands of Chios, Phocaea, and Lesbos from the Genoese with the aid of the rebuilt navy and reasserted imperial control over the separatist Greek states of Epirus and Thessaly.
