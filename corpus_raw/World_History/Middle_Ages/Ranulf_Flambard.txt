Ranulf Flambard,  (died Sept. 5, 1128), chief minister of King William II Rufus of England (ruled 1087–1100). Of Norman origin, Ranulf was made keeper of the seal for King William I the Conqueror about 1083, and during the reign of William II he became royal chaplain, chief adviser, and, for a time, chief justiciar. As administrator of the royal finances, he raised vast sums by increasing taxes and by extorting funds from the barons and the church. He delayed for years in making appointments to vacant sees and abbeys in order to obtain their revenues for William’s treasury.
In 1099 Ranulf was made bishop of Durham. William died shortly thereafter, and his successor, Henry I (ruled 1100–35), imprisoned Ranulf as a scapegoat for the late king’s unpopular policies. Early in 1101 Ranulf escaped to Normandy and incited Duke Robert II Curthose to attempt an invasion of England, which was unsuccessful. Ranulf was restored to royal favour and to his bishopric in 1101, but he never regained his former position as chief minister.
