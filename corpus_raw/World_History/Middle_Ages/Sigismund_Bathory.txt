Sigismund Báthory, Hungarian Zsigmond Báthory,  (born 1572—died  1613, Prague, Bohemia, Austrian Habsburg domain [now in Czech Republic]), prince of Transylvania whose unpopular anti-Turkish policy led to civil war.
The son of Christopher Báthory (prince of Transylvania, 1575–81) and nephew of Stephen (István Báthory, king of Poland, 1575–86), Sigismund succeeded his father in 1581 and actually assumed control of government affairs in 1588. Acting on the advice of his foreign counselor Alfonso Carrillo, Báthory reversed the traditional policy of Transylvania (i.e., to play off the Ottoman sultan against the Holy Roman emperor and thereby preserve Transylvanian de facto independence) and adopted an anti-Turk position. Although this policy shift provoked a rebellion, which was not suppressed until 1595, he nevertheless joined the princes Aaron of Moldavia and Michael the Brave of Walachia in an alliance against the Turks in 1594 and conquered Walachia for Michael after defeating an Ottoman army at Giurgiu (in present-day Romania; Oct. 25–27, 1595).
Báthory, a Roman Catholic, became increasingly active in the Counter-Reformation, to the dismay of the leading Transylvanian nationalists, most of whom were Protestant. In 1599 he decided to take holy orders; he separated from his wife, the archduchess Christina of Austria, and gave up his throne, offering it to the Habsburg emperor Rudolf II (also king of Hungary) in exchange for the Silesian duchy of Oppeln (Opole). Rudolf, however, supported Michael the Brave, who defeated Báthory’s son Andreas and declared himself prince of Transylvania. Báthory tried to recover his throne in 1600 and again in 1601, but on both occasions he was driven out by Michael, and he died in obscurity.
