Battle of Ankara,  Ankara also spelled Angora, (July 20, 1402), military confrontation in which forces of the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I, "the Thunderbolt," victor at the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, were defeated by those of the Central Asian ruler Timur (Tamerlane) and which resulted in humiliating defeat for Bayezid and the collapse of his empire.  The defeat came close to destroying the Ottoman Empire.
Bayezid I was at the height of his power, besieging the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, when he was drawn away from fighting the Christians by the threat of Timur’s army advancing from eastern Anatolia. Bayezid marched his army across Anatolia in the summer heat to face Timur, but the wily Asian warrior outmaneuvered him. As Bayezid marched eastward, Timur cut behind him and besieged the vital Ottoman city of Ankara.
Thirsty and exhausted, Bayezid’s troops had to turn back to attempt the relief of the city. Timur drew up his forces in battle order and forced Bayezid to attack by sending troops to divert the only source of water for his army—the Ottomans had to fight or die of thirst. Serbian cavalry, fighting as auxiliaries of the Ottomans, opened the battle with an effective charge, but Timur’s mounted archers took a heavy toll of Bayezid’s army. Thousands of Ottoman infantry were slaughtered. Bayezid fled from the battle with a cavalry force, but Timur pursued and surrounded him.
Bayezid became the only Ottoman ever to be captured by an enemy. He died in captivity in 1403, after allegedly being kept by Timur in a golden cage as a trophy. Timur advanced to the Aegean, forcing Bayezid’s son to flee Anatolia. Yet ultimately Timur’s army were only raiders; they established no permanent presence. The Timurid Empire declined rapidly after Timur’s death in 1405. For the Ottomans, decline was only temporary.
Losses: Timurid, 15,000 dead or wounded; Ottoman, 30,000 dead or wounded.
