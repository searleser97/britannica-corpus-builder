Battle of Djerba,  (May 1560). The Battle of Djerba was fought off the coast of Tunisia between the fleets of the Ottoman Empire and a Spanish-led alliance, commanded by the Genoese admiral, Giovanni Andrea Doria. Victory for the Ottomans marked the pinnacle of their naval superiority in the Mediterranean.
Victory in 1538 for the Ottoman fleet at Preveza was followed by increasingly threatening Turkish incursion into the western Mediterranean, putting the Spanish coast and the Balearic Islands at risk. To counter this, a new Christian alliance was formed that assembled a fleet of around fifty ships under the command of Giovanni Andrea Doria, a nephew of Andrea Doria.
In February 1560, the Christian fleet embarked to capture Tripoli in north Africa. However, the primary objective of the mission was cancelled because of sickness spreading through the fleet and adverse weather conditions. Instead, in March, the fleet reached the coast of Tunisia and easily took the fortress island of Djerba. The Ottoman network of north African forts quickly relayed news of the fall of Djerba to Admiral Piyale, who immediately gathered a fleet of one hundred ships and sailed for Djerba.
The Ottomans reached the island in May, catching the Christians by surprise and attacking their fleet as it lay anchored in port. The unprepared state of the Christian fleet meant that the battle was a walkover for the Ottomans and, within a few hours, more than half of the Christian fleet had been captured or sunk. The Christians sought refuge in the fort and were besieged for a few months before surrendering later in the year. Victory at Djerba prepared the way for the Ottoman Siege of Malta in 1565.
Losses: Christian allied, 30 ships sunk or captured, 15,000 dead or captured; Ottoman, fewer than 5 ships lost, 750 dead.
