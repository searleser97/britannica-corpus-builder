Alexius III Angelus, also spelled Alexios III Angelos,  (died 1211, Nicaea, Nicaean empire [now İznik, Turkey]), Byzantine emperor from 1195 to 1203. He was the second son of Andronicus Angelus, grandson of Alexius I. In 1195 he was proclaimed emperor by the troops; he captured his brother, the emperor Isaac II, at Stagira in Macedonia and had him blinded and imprisoned. Crowned in April 1195, Alexius III was a weak and greedy emperor, and his coup d’état had disastrous results. Byzantine prestige declined in the Balkans, where his failure to aid his son-in-law Stephen Prvovenčani (Stephen the First-Crowned) caused the latter to turn to the Bulgars for help. Campaigns against the Bulgars ended in defeat (1195 and 1196), and intrigues and diplomacy were equally unsuccessful because the new Bulgarian ruler, Kalojan, acknowledged the pope’s supremacy instead of that of Constantinople.
In 1203 the Fourth Crusade restored Isaac II and his son (crowned Alexius IV). Alexius III fled the capital with what treasure he could collect and escaped to Thrace. After an unsuccessful attempt to recover the throne, he wandered about Greece and surrendered to Boniface of Montferrat, then master of a great part of the Balkan Peninsula, but left his protection and sought shelter with Michael I, despot of Epirus. Finally, he went to Asia Minor, where his son-in-law Theodore Lascaris was holding his own against the Latins. Alexius, joined by the sultan of Iconium (modern Konya, Turkey), demanded Theodore’s crown and, when it was refused, marched against him. Taken prisoner by Theodore in 1211, Alexius was sent to a monastery at Nicaea, where he died.
