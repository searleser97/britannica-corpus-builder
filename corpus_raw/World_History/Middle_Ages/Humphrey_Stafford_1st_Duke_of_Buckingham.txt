Humphrey Stafford, 1st duke of Buckingham, in full Humphrey Stafford, 1st duke of Buckingham, earl of Stafford, earl of Buckingham, Baron Stafford, comte de Perche,  (born August 15, 1402—died  July 10, 1460, Northampton, Northamptonshire, England), Lancastrian prominent in the Hundred Years’ War in France and the Wars of the Roses in England.
He became 6th earl of Stafford when only a year old, his father having died in battle. He was knighted by Henry V in 1421 and then, under Henry VI, served several years in France in various military, administrative, and emissary roles; he was created comte de Perche (of Normandy) in 1431, inherited the earldom of Buckingham from his mother in 1438, and was created duke of Buckingham in 1444. A zealous Lancastrian, he added to his wealth the estates of dispossessed Yorkists, becoming perhaps the greatest landowner in all England. He was slain by Yorkists at the Battle of Northampton. His eldest son having been killed in an earlier battle, he was succeeded in his titles by his four-year-old grandson.
