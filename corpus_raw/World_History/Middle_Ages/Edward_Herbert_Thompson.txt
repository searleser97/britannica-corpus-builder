Edward Herbert Thompson,  (born Sept. 28, 1856, Worcester, Mass., U.S.—died  May 11, 1935, Plainfield, N.J.), American archaeologist who revealed much about Mayan civilization from his exploration of the city and religious shrine of Chichén Itzá in Yucatán.
Though lacking formal training in archaeology, Thompson was an enthusiastic antiquarian. In 1879 he published a paper suggesting that Mayan civilization may have originated on the lost continent of Atlantis. With the understanding that he could devote some time to the study of Mayan remains, he was appointed U.S. consul at Mérida, Mex., on Feb. 14, 1885. Upon assuming his post, he lived closely with the Maya Indians, learning their language and adopting their way of life. Through their friendship and confidence, he not only learned the lore of the ancient Maya but also secured valuable assistance in conducting his excavations.
Principal subjects of his work at Chichén Itzá included the great terraced pyramid, the astronomical observatory, the ceremonial court with its evidence of ritual games, and the temple decorated with a frieze of jaguars and shields and interior wall paintings of warriors attacking a city.
His most productive effort—and for many years a unique exploit in archaeology—was the dredging and underwater exploration of the Sacred Well of Chichén Itzá. Actually a small lake, it had been traditionally regarded as the grave of girls and captive warriors sacrificed alive to propitiate the rain god, who was supposed to reside at the bottom of the well. Thompson traveled to Boston to secure dredging equipment and deep-sea diving apparatus and to learn diving techniques. When his dredging efforts ceased to be productive, he descended into the well, where he found many skeletons and an extraordinary cache of archaeological remains. Difficulties with the Mexican government finally forced him to flee from Yucatán. He recounted his explorations in People of the Serpent (1932).
