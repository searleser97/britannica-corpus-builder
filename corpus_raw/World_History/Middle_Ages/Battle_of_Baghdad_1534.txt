Battle of Baghdad,  (1534). The Ottoman capture of Baghdad occurred during the first campaign of a twenty-year war between the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire and the Persian (Iranian) Safavid Empire of Shah Ṭahmāsp I. The famous city was to remain in Ottoman hands almost continuously until it was captured by the British in 1917.
War between the Ottoman and Safavid empires was brought about chiefly by territorial disputes along their Asian frontier, but also by Persian efforts to forge an alliance with the Hapsburg-controlled states, at the head of which sat the powerful Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V of Spain. Such an alliance would open up a double front against the powerful Ottoman Empire.
These tensions ignited into war when Ṭahmāsp had the governor of Baghdad—a supporter of the Ottoman cause—killed. The murder caused Suleiman to turn his attention away from his campaigns in central Europe to focus on the Safavid threat. The Ottomans invaded Safavid territory in 1531 and captured the Kurdish town of Bitlis in 1532 after a three-month siege. The force then advanced on the Safavid capital of Tabriz in eastern Persia, which was taken with ease. Ṭahmāsp continued to fall back, evading capture and avoiding engaging the Ottomans in battle. Baghdad fell in 1534, and Ṭahmāsp again withdrew.
From this point onward, he began harrying the Ottomans, launching guerrilla attacks and adopting a scorched-earth campaign that hampered Suleiman’s ability to supply his army. Frustrated by Ṭahmāsp’s tactics, Suleiman garrisoned his gains and withdrew in 1534, ending the first phase of the war with no decisive conclusion. After a further phase of fighting in 1548 to 1549, the war finally ended in 1555, leaving the Ottomans with key gains in Mesopotamia, including Baghdad.
Losses: Unknown.
