Battle of Edington,  (6–12 May 878).  The arrival of a Danish "great army" in East Anglia in 865 marked the start of a new phase of Viking attacks on Britain. Previously, the Vikings had come to raid and settle around the coast; this force came to conquer. Only the victory of Alfred the Great at Edington saved Anglo-Saxon independence.
After the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia, and Northumbria had been conquered by the Danish army, Wessex in southern England held out against the invaders. Alfred came to the throne after his brother, King Aethelred I, was killed fighting the Danes in 871. The new king benefited from a lull in the onslaught until 876, when Danish attacks resumed in earnest. Reinvading Wessex, they captured Wareham and, in 877, occupied Exeter. Alfred succeeded in forcing the Danes to withdraw to Mercia, but the reprieve was brief.
In January 878, under their leader Guthrum, the Danes struck back with a surprise attack against Alfred at his winter fortress at Chippenham. The king was lucky to escape, taking refuge with a handful of followers in the depths of the Somerset marshes at Athelney. There he built a fort that he used as a base for guerrilla warfare, while building up his forces. In May 878 he rode out to challenge the Danes at Edington (Ethandun) outside the now Danish-held fortress of Chippenham. Alfred’s warriors, fighting on foot, confronted the Danes with a dense shield wall. The battle raged until, in the words of his biographer, Asser, Alfred "overthrew the pagans with great slaughter, and smiting the fugitives, he pursued them as far as the fortress.” His victory was decisive, forcing Guthrum to withdraw from Wessex and agree to the division of England. Alfred’s Wessex controlled the south and west, Viking Danelaw the north and east.
Losses: Unknown.
