Flavius Ardaburius Aspar,  (died 471), Roman general of Alani descent, influential in the Eastern Roman Empire under the emperors Marcian (ruled 450–457) and Leo I (ruled 457–474).
Aspar led an East Roman fleet in 431 to expel the Vandals from Africa, but he was defeated and was forced to withdraw in 434, in which year he served as consul. Although Aspar fought the Persians successfully in 441, the Huns under Attila triumphed over him outside Constantinople in 443. Aspar’s influence increased; he was made a patrician after Marcian, who had formerly been in his service, became emperor in 450. When Marcian died Aspar had a protégé raised to the throne as Leo I (February 457). The general, head of a Gothic army devoted to him, was then at the height of his power. Leo, however, was not content to be Aspar’s puppet. He began to rely increasingly on Isaurian supporters (from southern Anatolia), and for about four years a struggle for ascendancy took place in the Eastern Roman Empire between Aspar’s Germans and the Isaurians led by Zeno. Aspar aroused intense resentment in Constantinople c. 470 by having the rank of caesar conferred on his son Patricius, though Patricius was an Arian Christian. A conspiracy organized by the Isaurians and Leo in 471 led to Aspar’s murder, and German domination over Eastern Roman policy ended.
