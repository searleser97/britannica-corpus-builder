Ahmed Cevdet Paşa,  (born March 22, 1822, Lovča, Ottoman Empire [now Lovech, Bulg.]—died  May 25, 1895, Istanbul [now in Turkey]), statesman and historian, a major figure in 19th-century Turkish letters.
Cevdet went to Istanbul at the age of 17 to complete his education at a religious college. In 1844/45 he was appointed qadi (judge) and then became the juridical adviser to the grand vizier (Ottoman prime minister), Mustafa Reşid Paşa, from 1846 to 1858. Throughout his life Cevdet held a number of important positions in the Ottoman government, including the post of vak’anüvis, or official court chronicler; the governorships of a number of Ottoman provinces; and, finally, the post of minister of justice, in which position he supervised and was a driving force behind the official codification and consolidation of Ottoman law, known as the Mecelle. More conservative than many of his contemporaries, however, who advocated a legal code based on the French Civil Code, Cevdet favoured a system based mainly on Islāmic law.
Although he wrote poetry in his early years, Cevdet is known mainly for his historical works, among which the best known are his 12-volume Tarih-ı Cevdet (“Cevdet’s Chronicle”), covering the period 1774 to 1826; the Tezakir-i Cevdet (“The Memoirs of Cevdet”), a collection of observations made on the events during his service as official court chronicler; and the Marûzat (“Observations”), written about the events from 1839 to 1876. Cevdet also wrote a number of Turkish grammars, including the Kavaid-i Osmaniye (“Ottoman Fundamentals”), with an important introduction, as well as a simpler version, the Kavaid-i Türkiye (“Turkish Fundamentals”).
Other works include his Takvim-i Edvar (“The Calendar of the Ages”), which deals with the reform of the calendar, and, finally, his completion of the translation of the Muqaddimah (“Prologomena”) to the historical work of the great 14th-century Arab historian Ibn Khaldūn, a work that profoundly influenced Cevdet Paşa’s writings.
