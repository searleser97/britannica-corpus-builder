Siege of Edessa,  (28 November–24 December 1144).  The fall of the crusader city of Edessa to the Muslims was the spark that ignited the Second Crusade. The victory entrenched Zengi as leader of the Muslims in the Holy Land, a mantle that would be taken up by his son Nur ad-Din and then by Saladin.
After victory at the Battle of Harran, the Muslim forces in the Holy Land fractured into warring factions. In 1128 Zengi of Mosul captured Aleppo and cowed neighboring Muslim rulers into submission. In 1144 Zengi learned that Count Joscelin of Edessa had argued with Prince Raymond of Antioch, and then taken almost his entire army to Diyarbakir to interfere in a dispute between Seljuk princes. Zengi marched a large army to Edessa hoping to overwhelm the city before Joscelin could return. He arrived on 28 November and began battering the walls with trebuchets and mining under the foundations. The city walls were, however, exceptionally strong, and the defenders put up determined resistance despite their low numbers. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem mustered a relief force that marched for Edessa, but Prince Raymond of Antioch refused to help. On 24 December, a section of the walls collapsed into a mine and Zengi’s troops poured into the city, capturing everything except the citadel. Zengi had the local Christians separated from foreign Christians, and then had all the latter executed. The men holding the citadel surrendered on 26 December on condition that their lives be spared. Joscelin and the troops sent by Melisende arrived a few days too late to save Edessa, but did hold on to the lands west of the Euphrates River.
When news of the fall of Edessa reached Rome, Pope Eugene III called for the raising of the Second Crusade. This would greatly strengthen the remaining crusader states, although Edessa was never recaptured.
Losses: Unknown, although all of the crusader garrison was killed.
