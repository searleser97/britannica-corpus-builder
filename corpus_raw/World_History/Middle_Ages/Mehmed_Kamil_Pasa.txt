Mehmed Kâmil Paşa,  (born 1832, Cyprus—died Nov. 14, 1913, Nicosia), Turkish army officer who served four times as Ottoman grand vizier (chief minister).
Trained as a military officer in Cairo, Kâmil held a succession of government posts until he became grand vizier in 1885–91 and again in 1895. Sultan Abdülhamid II dismissed him because he proposed a cabinet responsible to Parliament, and he then served as governor of Smyrna for 12 years.
After the revolution of 1908, Kâmil joined the cabinet of Said Paşa and later that same year replaced him as grand vizier. At first his administration succeeded, but in 1909 he was forced to resign by the Committee of Union and Progress. He became grand vizier in 1912 for the fourth time but was forced to resign in 1913 as a result of Enver Paşa’s coup d’état.
