Battle of Myriocephalon,  (September 1176), victory of the Seljuq Turks under Qïlïch Arslan II over the Byzantine army of Manuel I Comnenus in a mountain pass near the ruined fortress of Myriocephalon (southeast of modern Ankara, Tur.) in Phrygia. The battle ended Byzantium’s last hope of expelling the Turks from Anatolia.
Manuel determined to reassert his suzerainty over former Byzantine territory by capturing Iconium (now Konya, Turkey), a city of the Seljuq sultanate of Rūm. Ignoring Qïlïch Arslan’s attempts to arrange a peace treaty, Manuel led his army across the plains of Anatolia. Slowed by heavy wagons carrying supplies and siege machinery, the Byzantines failed to prevent the Turks from devastating the countryside through which they marched. Making their way up into the Phrygian mountains, the Byzantines arrived at the pass of Tzibritze, which permitted access to the fort of Myriocephalon. The Turkish army massed on the hills flanking the pass.
Manuel’s experienced generals warned of impending disaster, but he chose instead to follow the advice of the battle-hungry younger princes, sending the vanguard of the army through the Tzibritze pass. The Turks feigned flight, circling around into the hills, and then charged down the narrow pass onto the main body of the army. Manuel panicked and fled back through the pass, throwing his army into disarray, and the Turkish victory was complete.
