Romanus III Argyrus,  (born c. 968â€”died  April 11/12, 1034), Byzantine emperor from 1028 to 1034.
Of noble family, he was a prefect of Constantinople when he was compelled by the dying emperor, Constantine VIII, to marry his daughter Zoe and to become his successor. Romanus showed great eagerness to make his mark as a ruler but was mostly unfortunate in his enterprises; and in his endeavour to relieve the pressure of taxation and lavish expenditure on the churches of the capital, he disorganized the finances of the state. In 1030 he resolved to retaliate against the incursions of the Muslims on the eastern frontier by leading a large army against Aleppo, but he was defeated. His drowning was supposed to have been caused by his wife.
