Michael Critobulus, Critobulus also spelled Kritoboulos,  (flourished 15th century), historian whose account of the Turkish destruction of the Byzantine Empire remains as one of the few contemporary works on that period of Byzantium.
Almost nothing is known of his life. He was probably a native of the Aegean island of Imbros (later Gökçeada). Although he was not an eyewitness of the Turkish siege of Constantinople (which fell in 1453), he visited the city shortly afterward and later served under the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II as governor of Imbros. Although he grieved over the downfall of Constantinople and the decline of the Byzantine Empire, he admired Mehmed and provided a nonpartisan and generally accurate history of the Turkish invasion. His History of Mehmed the Conqueror covers only the first 17 years (1451–68) of Mehmed’s 30-year reign, but it remains a vividly descriptive and authoritative source for scholars of Byzantium.
