Siege of Corfu,  (19 July–20 August 1716).  The Siege of Corfu was a key encounter in the Ottoman-Venetian War (1714–18), the last in a series of wars between the two Mediterranean powers that stretched back to the fifteenth century. The failure to take Corfu by the Ottoman forces was hailed as a great victory across Christian Europe.
The Ottoman Empire declared war on Venice in 1714, determined to reverse their losses in the Great Turkish War of 1684 to 1699. After victory at Thebes, the Ottomans conquered Venice’s Peloponnesian territories in June 1714, under the command of the grand vizier, Damat Ali Pasha. Venetian forces were no match for the Ottoman Empire, and, after capturing Venetian bases in the Ionian Islands, the Ottomans arrived at Corfu on 8 July 1716. The Ottoman fleet was met by a Venetian fleet, commanded by Andrea Cornaro. The Venetians attempted to destroy the Ottoman fleet with fireships, but failed when the Ottomans withdrew slightly. After several hours, the Venetians withdrew and the Ottomans landed their invasion force. After a swift advance that overran a number of forts, the Ottomans besieged the city of Corfu on 19 July.
Over the next twenty-two days, the Turks launched assaults on the city’s defenses; each time the attacks were repelled after savage fighting. The Venetian garrison, led by Count von der Schulenburg, put up a heroic defense and was victorious eventually. However, the victory can also be attributed to the city’s formidable fortifications and a huge storm that raged on 9 August. The failure of the siege was a celebrated victory for Venice, but the republic never regained its losses in the Peloponnese despite Austria’s entry into the war. The Ottoman Empire was forced into a disadvantageous peace in 1718.
Losses: Unknown.
