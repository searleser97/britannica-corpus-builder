Piero di Tommaso Soderini,  (born May 18, 1452, Florence [Italy]—died  June 13, 1522, Rome, Papal States [Italy]), Florentine statesman during the late 15th and early 16th centuries.
Soderini was descended from an old Florentine family that had become famous in medicine. He became a prior in 1481 and later became a favourite of Piero di Lorenzo de’ Medici, who made him ambassador to the French court in 1493. After the expulsion of Piero and the martyrdom of Savonarola, Soderini was elected (1502) gonfalonier for life by the Florentines, who wished to give greater stability to their republican institutions. His rule proved moderate and wise, though he lacked the qualities of a great statesman. He introduced a system of national militia in the place of foreign mercenaries, and, during his government, the long war with Pisa was brought to a close with the capture of Pisa by the Florentines in 1509. Grateful to France, who had assisted him, he always took the French side in Italian politics.
In 1512 the Medici with the help of a Spanish army returned to Florence, deposed Soderini, and drove him into exile. He took refuge at Ragusa in Dalmatia, where he remained until the election of the Medici pope Leo X, who summoned him to Rome and conferred many favours on him. Soderini lived his remaining years in Rome, working for the good of Florence, to which he was never allowed to return.
