Sack of Rome,  (6 May 1527). Victory over the French at Pavia in 1525 left the forces of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, dominant in Italy. In 1527 these forces stormed the city of Rome and embarked on an orgy of destruction and massacre, terrorizing the population and humiliating Pope Clement VII.
Pope Clement had unwisely formed an alliance, the League of Cognac, to challenge Charles’s supremacy in Italy. Rome was not, however, attacked on the emperor’s orders, but on the initiative of imperial troops angry at not being paid. These ragged and hungry soldiers, including German Landsknecht mercenaries and Spanish infantry, mutinied and marched on Rome, under the command of renegade French aristocrat the Duke of Bourbon.
The walls of Rome were poorly defended, the city’s garrison numbering only 8,000 men, including the 2,000-strong Swiss Guard. On 6 May the rebellious imperial army launched an assault in the face of cannon and arquebus fire. The Duke of Bourbon was shot dead but the men he had led swept into the city, killing everyone in sight, armed or not. The Swiss Guards fought bravely to defend St. Peter’s Basilica and created enough delay to allow Pope Clement to escape down a tunnel into the fortress of Castel Sant’Angelo. There he was besieged while the city was laid waste. The Protestant Landsknecht felt particular hatred for Catholic Rome and its idolatrous Renaissance treasures—they stabled horses in St. Peter’s—but the Catholic Spanish equaled them in cruelty and destructiveness. Clement surrendered in June, agreeing to pay a huge ransom and cede substantial territory to Charles V who, although embarrassed by the brutal conduct of his troops, was happy to accept the advantage he had gained.
Losses: Roman, 1,000 Swiss Guards and 25,000 civilian casualties; Holy Roman Empire, unknown.
