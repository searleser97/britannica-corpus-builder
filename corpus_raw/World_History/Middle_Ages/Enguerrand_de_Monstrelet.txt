Enguerrand de Monstrelet,  (born c. 1390 —died  July 1453),  member of a noble family of Picardy, remembered for his chronicle of the final stages of the Hundred Years’ War. His chronicle is valuable because of the many authentic documents used and the credibly accurate speeches it records.
Monstrelet was in the service of John of Luxembourg, who besieged Compiègne before Joan of Arc’s capture; and, though he did not see Joan captured, he witnessed her later interview with Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. Monstrelet’s chronicle, in two books, continues that of Jean Froissart and covers the years 1400–44.
