Lothar II (or III), also spelled Lothair,  (born early June 1075—died Dec. 3/4, 1137, Breitenwang, now in Austria), German king (1125–37) and Holy Roman emperor (1133–37). He is reckoned as Lothar III by those who count not only Lothar I but also his son Lothar in their numeration of German kings. Lothar II’s election as king in 1125 represented a triumph for the principle of elective monarchy over that of hereditary succession, on which the claims of his Hohenstaufen opponents and their Salian predecessors were based.
Lothar, the son of Gebhard, count of Supplinburg, was born a few days before his father was killed in battle on June 9, 1075. He succeeded to extensive lands around Helmstedt, in Saxony, and in 1088 became involved in an uprising against the Holy Roman emperor Henry IV. By his marriage in 1110 to Richenza, heiress of both the Nordheim and the Brunswick houses, Lothar became the most powerful noble in Saxony and the wealthiest prince in northern Germany.
Having supported the German king Henry V against his father, Henry IV, in 1104, Lothar was appointed duke of Saxony by Henry V when Duke Magnus, the last of the Billung dynasty, died in 1106. Lothar’s independent attitude, however, soon brought him into conflict with the king. From 1112 to 1115 he was intermittently involved in revolts against Henry, and his forces defeated the king at the Battle of Welfesholz in 1115.
In 1125 Henry V died, and Lothar was elected German king and crowned at Aachen. Civil war between Lothar’s supporters and the heirs of the house of Hohenstaufen, the brothers Conrad and Frederick, duke of Swabia, broke out. In 1127 Conrad was elected king by his adherents. The fall of the Hohenstaufen strongholds Nürnberg and Speyer two years later ended effective resistance, although the Hohenstaufens carried on the struggle for several more years while Conrad maintained his fictitious title.
In 1130 Lothar’s support was solicited by two rival candidates for the papacy, Innocent II and Anacletus II. In March 1131 Lothar received Innocent at Liège, and, accompanied by Innocent, he marched with his army into Italy in 1132–33. Although part of Rome was held by Anacletus, Lothar was crowned Holy Roman emperor in June 1133. He then received as papal fiefs the vast estates of Matilda of Tuscany.
In 1134, after his return to Germany, Lothar resumed the campaign against the Hohenstaufens. Frederick of Hohenstaufen soon submitted. Peace was proclaimed at the Diet of Bamberg (March 1135), at which Swabia was returned to Frederick. In September 1135 Conrad made peace with Lothar under similar lenient conditions.
Lothar, in addition, encouraged the extension of German authority and the spread of Christianity in the districts east of the Elbe. In 1135 Eric II of Denmark declared himself a vassal of Lothar, and the Polish prince Bolesław III promised tribute and received Pomerania and Rügen as German fiefs.
As the result of an agreement with the Byzantine emperor John Comnenus, Lothar launched a second Italian expedition in 1136–37, driving the forces of Roger II of Sicily from the southern part of the Italian peninsula. He died on his way back to Germany.
