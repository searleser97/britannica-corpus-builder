 Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte was elected the first president of France in 1848. Prior to that point, the country had been ruled by kings, emperors, and various executives. The succession of republics was several times interrupted (1852–70, 1940–44, and 1944–46) by other forms of government that did not entail a presidency. This is a chronologically ordered list of the presidents of France. (See also major rulers of France.)
