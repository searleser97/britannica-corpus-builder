Orderic Vitalis,  (born Feb. 16, 1075, near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, Eng.—died c. 1142), English monk of Saint-Évroult in Normandy, a historian who in his Historia ecclesiastica left one of the fullest and most graphic accounts of Anglo-Norman society in his own day.
The eldest son of Odelerius of Orléans, the chaplain to Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Shrewsbury, he was sent to Normandy in 1085 to become a monk at Saint-Évroult, where he was given the name Vitalis. There, apart from a few visits to other monasteries, he passed the remainder of his life.
He began his historical work before 1109 by transcribing the Gesta Normannorum ducum of William of Jumièges with lengthy interpolations of his own, chiefly relating to the history of Norman families connected with Saint-Évroult. Not later than 1115, at the command of his abbot, he began a history of his own monastery and its patrons, which gradually expanded into a general history of the church and incorporated a chronological outline of events from the birth of Christ, originally intended as a separate work. He worked on his history, periodically revising the early parts, until June 1141.
He made critical use of all the works of contemporary historians. His account of William the Conqueror’s campaigns in 1067–71, based on William of Poitiers, has the value of a contemporary narrative, because the last books of William’s Gesta Guillelmi ducis Normannorum et regis Anglorum have not survived in the original. Otherwise the Historia ecclesiastica is most valuable for Norman, English, and French history in the period 1082–1141. It has been edited and translated by Marjorie Chibnall (1969), who also wrote The World of Orderic Vitalis (1984, reissued 1996), a study of his life and times.
