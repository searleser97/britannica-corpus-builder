Pierre II de Brézé,  Brézé also spelled Breszé,  (born 1410?—died  July 16, 1465, Montlhéry, France), trusted soldier and statesman of Charles VII of France.
Brézé made his name in the Hundred Years’ War when in 1433 he joined with Yolande (the queen of Sicily), the Constable de Richemont, and others in chasing from power Charles VII’s minister, Georges de La Trémoille. Brézé also won distinction in the Praguerie (a revolt of the nobles against Charles in 1440), when he supported the royal cause against the dauphin Louis, a service remembered against him after Louis came to the throne (as Louis XI). Brézé was made seneschal of Anjou in 1437 and of Poitou in 1441, fought the English in Normandy in 1440–41 and in Guienne in 1442, and became chamberlain to Charles VII and gained the chief power in the state through the influence of Agnès Sorel. The years of his ascendancy (1444–50) were the most prosperous period of Charles VII’s reign.
The dauphin Louis in 1448 brought against Brézé accusations that led to a formal trial, resulting in a complete exoneration of Brézé and his restoration to favour. He played a large part in the reconquest of Normandy (1449–51), especially in the Battle of Formigny, and became seneschal of the province in 1451. He made an ineffective descent on the English coast at Sandwich in 1457 and was preparing an expedition in favour of Margaret of Anjou when the accession of Louis XI brought him disgrace and a short imprisonment.
He accompanied Margaret to Scotland with a force of 2,000 men in 1462 and brought her back to Flanders on the collapse of her plans in 1463. Reappointed seneschal of Normandy, he was killed in the Battle of Montlhéry. He was succeeded as seneschal by his eldest son, Jacques de Brézé (c. 1440–90), Count de Maulévrier, and by his grandson Louis de Brézé (d. 1531), husband of Diane de Poitiers.
