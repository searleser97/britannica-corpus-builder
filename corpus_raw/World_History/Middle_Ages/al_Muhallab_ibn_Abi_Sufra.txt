Al-Muhallab ibn Abī Ṣufrā,  (born c. 632, Arabia—died February 702), Arab general in the service of the Umayyad caliphate and an important participant in the political developments of his time.
Al-Muhallab first served under the caliph Muʿāwiyah, campaigning in India and raiding the country between Kābul and Multān. Later he was stationed in the eastern provinces, leading expeditions against the Central Asian city of Samarkand for the governors of Khorāsān. Soon after the death of Muʿāwiyah (680), the Islamic community was convulsed by civil wars. During this time al-Muhallab deserted the Umayyads and sided with the anti-caliph ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Zubayr, who appointed him governor of the eastern province of Khorāsān. Before he could assume his responsibilities, however, he was forced to undertake several campaigns against the Azraqīs, a fanatical Muslim sect that made war on all who would not join them. He eventually pursued them into Persia and was able to break their power after a religious schism divided their ranks. Al-Muhallab finally assumed his duties in Khorāsān and began to launch campaigns deeper into Central Asia, in the course of which he met his death.
