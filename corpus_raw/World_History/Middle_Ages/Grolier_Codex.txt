Grolier Codex,  codex fragment consisting of 11 damaged pages from a presumed 20-page book and 5 single pages. Discovered in Mexico in 1965, the documents were named for the Grolier Club (founded 1884) of New York City, an association of bibliophiles who first photographed, published, and presented the codex, with an analysis by anthropologist Michael D. Coe. Coe’s examination revealed that the Grolier Codex is related to the Dresden Codex and, like it, deals with the Venus calendar. The style of the Grolier is hybrid, showing Toltec and Mixtec influences. It is the subject of Coe’s work The Maya Scribe and His World (1973).
