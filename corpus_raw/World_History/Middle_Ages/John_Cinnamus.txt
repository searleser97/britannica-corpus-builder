John Cinnamus, Greek Ioánnis Kínnamos,  (flourished 12th century), Byzantine historian, secretary (grammatikos) to the emperor Manuel I Comnenus, whom he accompanied on campaigns in Europe and Asia Minor. Cinnamus’s history of the period 1118–76, continuing the Alexiad of Anna Comnena, covers the reigns of John II and Manuel I, down to the unsuccessful campaign against the Turks of Iconium when the Byzantines were routed (1176) at Myriocephalon. Cinnamus was probably an eyewitness to the events of the last 10 years of the period he describes. The work breaks off abruptly and appears to be incomplete. The author’s hero is Manuel, but, in spite of his conviction that the Greek East was superior to the Latin West and his opposition to papal claims, he retains considerable objectivity.
