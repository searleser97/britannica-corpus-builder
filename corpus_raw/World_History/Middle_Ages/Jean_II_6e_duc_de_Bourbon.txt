Jean II, 6e duc de Bourbon,  (born 1427—died 1488), duke of Bourbon (from 1456) whose military successes, as at Formigny (1450) and Châtillon (1453), contributed greatly to the conquest of Normandy and Guyenne and the rout of the English. From Louis XI of France he received the governance of Orléanais, Berry, Limousin, Périgord, and Languedoc (1466) and became an ardent supporter of the crown. His brother, Charles II of Bourbon (1433–88), became archbishop of Lyon (1444) and then cardinal (1476).
