Mayor of the palace,  official of the western European kingdoms of the 6th–8th century, whose status developed under the Merovingian Franks from that of an officer of the household to that of regent or viceroy. The Merovingian kings adopted the system by which great landowners of the Roman Empire had employed a major domus (mayor, or supervisor, of the household) to superintend the administration of numerous, often scattered, estates. The Merovingians appointed a major palatii (mayor of the palace) to perform a similar function. The mayor gradually acquired further duties and powers: he obtained authority over court personnel, advised the king on the appointment of counts and dukes, protected the commendati (persons commended to the king) and the king’s wards, and eventually even came to command the royal army.
It was probably a long series of Merovingian child kings from the late 6th century onward that enabled the mayors of the palace, as tutors of the young rulers, to gain control of the government. Eventually, they maintained it even when the kings had come of age. At first liberal to, and thus supported by, the landowning aristocracy, some mayors later became strong enough to act severely toward them.
From the second quarter of the 7th century, members of the Carolingian family usually held the mayoral power in the Frankish kingdom of Austrasia. After Pippin II of Herstal had defeated the Neustrians at Tertry in 687, the three Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia, Neustria, and Burgundy were united under his de facto rule as mayor of the palace. His grandson Pippin III the Short set aside the Merovingian king Childeric III in 751 and had himself elected king, becoming the first of the Carolingian dynasty.
