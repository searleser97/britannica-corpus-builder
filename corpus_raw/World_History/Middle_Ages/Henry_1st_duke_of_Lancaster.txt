Henry, 1st duke and 4th earl of Lancaster, in full Henry, 1st duke and 4th earl of Lancaster, earl of Leicester, earl of Derby, earl of Lincoln, earl of Moray, Lord Lancaster,  (born c. 1300, perhaps at Grosmont Castle, Monmouthshire, Wales—died March 24, 1361, Leicester, Leicestershire, Eng.), soldier and diplomat, the most trusted adviser of King Edward III of England (reigned 1327–77). He was unquestionably the most powerful feudal lord in England at that time.
The son of Henry, 3rd earl of Lancaster, he was the great-grandson of King Henry III and the grandfather of King Henry IV. Created earl of Derby in 1337, he succeeded to his father’s earldoms of Lancaster and Leicester in 1345. In 1349 he was made earl of Lincoln and in 1351 duke of Lancaster, with sovereign (or palatine) powers within his domains. King David II of Scotland created him earl of Moray in 1359.
During the Hundred Years’ War between France and England (1337–1453), Henry served in the naval battles off Sluis (now in the Netherlands) in 1340 and off Winchelsea, Sussex, in 1350. From 1345 to 1347 he was Edward III’s lieutenant and captain in southwestern France. He won a notable victory over a superior French force at Auberoche in Périgord in October 1345 and sacked Poitiers in October 1346. In 1349 he was appointed captain and vice-regent of Gascony and Poitou. As Edward’s commissioner in France, he was largely responsible for negotiating in May 1360 the provisional Treaty of Brétigny, thus ending the first phase of the war. At various times he was sent on embassies to most of the courts of Europe. He died of the plague.
Upon the death of Lancaster’s older daughter, Maud, in 1362, the Lancastrian titles and estates passed to his younger daughter, Blanche, and her husband, John of Gaunt. Their son became King Henry IV, the first Lancastrian ruler of England.
