Battle of Kosovo,  Kosovo also spelled Kossovo, (June 28 [June 15, Old Style], 1389), battle fought at Kosovo Polje ("Field of the Blackbirds"; now in Kosovo) between the armies of the Serbian prince Lazar and the Turkish forces of the Ottoman sultan Murad I (reigned 1360–89) that left both leaders killed and ended in a Turkish victory, the collapse of Serbia, and the complete encirclement of the crumbling Byzantine Empire by Turkish armies.
Under Sultan Murad’s rule the Turks had been expanding their rule from Anatolia into the Balkans, where the Serb Empire was potentially their strongest opponent. At the Battle of Maritsa in 1371 the Serbs suffered a severe defeat that fragmented their empire into rival princedoms.
Murad resumed his campaigns against the Serbs in the 1380s. In the summer of 1389 he halted at Kosovo, from where he had options to attack Serbia or Macedonia. While Murad consulted with his commanders, Lazar mustered all his forces in alliance with Vuk Branković, a Serbian noble, and advanced on Kosovo. Lazar’s army is thought to have been less than half the size of Murad’s force. The battle began with Ottoman archers bombarding the advancing Serbian cavalry, which blunted their impact on the Turkish lines. However, inroads had been made and the Serbian charge was followed up by heavily armored knights. Fearing that the Serbians might break through, the Turks counterattacked, routing the Serbian infantry.
Some records claim that Lazar was captured and executed; others claim that he was deserted by the jealous Brankovi? and fought valiantly until hacked to death. Murad is thought to have been killed by a Serbian knight, Miloš Obilić, in the immediate aftermath of the battle. Although both sides suffered huge losses, the Ottomans possessed the resources to raise another army and Serbia became part of the Ottoman Empire.
Losses: Heavy on both sides, including both leaders and much of the Serbian nobility.
