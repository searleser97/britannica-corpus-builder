Stephen II (or III),  (born, Rome—died April 26, 757, Rome), pope from 752 to 757. He severed ties with the Byzantine Empire and thus became the first temporal sovereign of the newly founded Papal States.
He was a deacon when chosen on March 26, 752, as the second successor to Pope St. Zacharias (the first successor, Stephen II, had died on the previous day without being consecrated). The central act of his pontificate was to free the papacy from Byzantium and to ally it with the Franks against the Lombards, who, under the Lombardic king Aistulf, were threatening Rome and attempting to conquer all of Italy.
Following unsuccessful negotiations with Aistulf at Pavia in the fall of 753, Stephen became the first pope to make the trip across the Alps to Gaul. There he met (Jan. 6, 754) the Frankish king Pippin III the Short, who promised to restore to the church the lands taken by the Lombards. In July 754 at the abbey of Saint-Denis, France, Stephen anointed Pippin and his sons Charlemagne and Carloman, consecrating them kings of the Romans. Pippin then invaded Italy with his Frankish nobles, besieging Aistulf at Pavia; Stephen returned to Rome the following October. After Pippin’s army returned to Gaul, however, Aistulf resumed his war on Italy. By January 756 the Lombards had surrounded Rome, which they planned to make their capital.
After Stephen sent another appeal, Pippin, Charlemagne, and Carloman returned to Italy in 756, subduing the Lombards and conferring on Stephen territory in the exarchate of Ravenna, the duchy of Rome, and the districts of Venetia and Istria, thereby founding the Papal States under Stephen’s rule. Secured also was papal independence from the imperial regime at Constantinople, making the Frankish ruler protector of the papacy. Thus the pope became a sovereign prince.
