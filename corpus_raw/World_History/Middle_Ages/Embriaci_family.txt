Embriaci Family,   a powerful Genoese family, whose members played notable roles in the Crusades in the Holy Land in the 11th and 12th centuries. Guglielmo Embriaco and his brother Primo di Castello sailed for the Holy Land in 1099 and participated in the capture of Jerusalem and the defeat of an Egyptian army at Ramla. Guglielmo returned to Genoa to raise fresh troops and then participated in the capture of Arsuf, south of Jaffa (1101). The supposed Holy Grail, thought to be carved from a single great emerald (much later found to be glass), was captured at Caesarea and sent to the cathedral of San Lorenzo in Genoa. Returning to Genoa, Guglielmo served a term as consul of the comune.
In 1109 Guglielmo’s son Ugo (Hugh) took part in the capture of Gibilet, north of Beirut, two-thirds of which was ceded to the Embriaci; 30 years later the family acquired the remaining third, and in 1154 it received the Genoese quarter of Acre. Gradually an autocratic faction, made up of a handful of aristocratic clans, including the Embriaci, gained dominion over the Genoese comune and trade with the crusader states. The faction was ousted in Genoa in 1164; nevertheless, the Embriaci continued to rule Gibilet. Guglielmo’s great-great-granddaughter, Plaisance, married Bohemond IV of Antioch and Tripoli; their son succeeded as Bohemond V. Eventually, the Embriaci renounced Genoese citizenship and, when the Holy Land fell in 1187, withdrew to Cyprus.
The Embriaci Tower, built in the 12th century, still stands in the old quarter of Genoa.
