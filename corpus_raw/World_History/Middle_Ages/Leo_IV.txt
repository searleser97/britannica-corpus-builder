Leo IV, byname Leo The Khazar,  (born Jan. 25, 749—died  Sept. 8, 780), Byzantine emperor whose reign marked a transition between the period of Iconoclasm and the restoration of the icons.
Leo became Byzantine emperor in 775 at the death of his father, Constantine V. The following year, at the request of the army and with the support of the Senate and the citizens, Leo’s young son Constantine was crowned coemperor, passing over the caesar Nicephorus, a stepbrother of Leo. The resulting conspiracy in favour of the caesar Nicephorus was, however, suppressed, and the conspirators were exiled.
Leo profited from discord among the Bulgars by granting the Bulgar khan Telerig asylum in Constantinople (776–777) and marrying him to a cousin of his wife Irene. He also conducted three campaigns against the Arabs between 777 and 780.
At the beginning of his reign Leo made no attempt to continue his father’s fierce Iconoclastic policy that forbade the use of icons (religious images). Instead he showed considerable moderation toward the proponents of icons, even appointing them to bishoprics. This action may have resulted from the influence of Irene, who was strongly orthodox. In 780, however, shortly before the close of his reign, he reversed his policy and initiated a persecution of those favouring the use of icons.
