John V Palaeologus,  (born June 18, 1332, Didymoteichon, Byzantine Empire [modern Dhidhimótikhon, Greece]—died February 16, 1391, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]), Byzantine emperor (1341–91) whose rule was marked by civil war and increased domination by the Ottoman Turks, despite his efforts to salvage the empire.
Nine years old when his father, Andronicus III, died, John was too young to rule, and a dispute over the regency broke out between his mother, Anna of Savoy, and John Cantacuzenus, chief minister under Andronicus III. Cantacuzenus won the ensuing civil war and was crowned coemperor with John V at Constantinople in 1347. Despite John V’s subsequent marriage to Helen, Cantacuzenus’s daughter, he formed an alliance with the Venetians against Cantacuzenus, forcing him to abdicate in 1354.
When the Ottoman Turks, who had gained a foothold in Europe by occupying Gallipoli, threatened Constantinople (1354), John appealed to the West for help, proposing to end the schism between the Byzantine and Latin churches. Wars with the Serbs and Turks drained the Byzantine treasury, and John was detained as an insolvent debtor when he visited Venice in 1369.
In 1371 John was forced to recognize the suzerainty of the Turks when they gained control of large parts of Macedonia. When he was deposed and imprisoned in 1376 by his son, the Turks helped him regain the throne (1379), but when John tried to rebuild the fortifications around Constantinople, the Turkish sultan ordered them destroyed, threatening to blind John’s heir, Manuel, then residing at the Turkish court. John left Manuel an empire greatly reduced in size and strength, a Turkish overlord, and a frightened populace.
