 Spain’s constitution declares it a constitutional monarchy. From 1833 until 1939 Spain almost continually had a parliamentary system with a written constitution. Except during the First Republic (1873–74), the Second Republic (1931–36), and the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), Spain has always had a monarchy. The monarch is the head of state, but the crown’s role is defined as strictly neutral and apolitical.
