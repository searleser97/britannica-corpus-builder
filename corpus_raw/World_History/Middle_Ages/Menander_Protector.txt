Menander Protector,   (flourished  6th century ad), Byzantine historian whose surviving works are a valuable authority for the 6th century, especially on geography and ethnography. At the suggestion of the Emperor Maurice (582â€“602), he wrote a history modeled on that of Agathias. It begins at the point where Agathias left off, and the surviving text includes the period from the arrival of the Kotrigur Huns in Thrace in 558 down to the negotiations with the Avars about Sirmium in 582. Considerable fragments of the history are preserved.
