Adhémar De Chabannes,   (born 988, Limousin, Aquitaine [France]—died  1034), Frankish chronicler whose major work, Chronicon Aquitanicum et Francicum (“Chronicle of Aquitaine and France”), traces the history of Aquitaine and of the Franks from the times of the legendary king Pharamond.
The first two books of Adhémar’s history are of little value because his sources were severely limited. The third book, however, contains a reasonably accurate history of western France between 814 and 1028. Adhémar seems to have been more concerned about the development of his narrative than the accuracy of his dates. He also invented the famous dialogue between Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king of France, and his vassal in which Hugh asked his vassal, “Who made you duke?” and received the response, “Who made you king?” Adhémar’s works were critically edited by J. Chavanon (1897) and his minor works published by J.-P. Migne in Patrologia Latina, vol. 141 (1853).
