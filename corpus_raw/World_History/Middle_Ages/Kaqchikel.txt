Kaqchikel, formerly spelled Cakchiquel,  Mayan people of the midwestern highlands of Guatemala, closely related linguistically and culturally to the neighbouring K’iche’ and Tz’utujil. They are agriculturalists, and their culture is syncretic, a fusion of Spanish and Mayan elements. Their sharing of a common language does not provide a basis for ethnic identification among the Kaqchikel; the Indians themselves, like other Mayan peoples of the region, are organized into municipios (“municipalities”), and the people identify themselves with their own municipio. Each community usually speaks its own dialect of Kaqchikel, which is mutually intelligible with other dialects of Kaqchikel and is partly intelligible with K’iche’ and Tz’utujil. Each community also has its own political and religious hierarchy, local costume, patron saints, and economic specialty. Often, marriage to someone outside the municipio is considered improper.
