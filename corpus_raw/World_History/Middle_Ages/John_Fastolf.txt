Sir John Fastolf,  (born c. 1378, Caister, Norfolk, England—died November 5, 1459, Caister), English career soldier who fought and made his fortune in the second phase of the Hundred Years’ War between England and France (1337–1453). His name is immortalized through William Shakespeare’s character Sir John Falstaff, but the courageous Fastolf bears little resemblance to the cowardly, dissolute, clowning Falstaff of Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, and The Merry Wives of Windsor.
Fastolf served with distinction against the French at Agincourt (1415) and Verneuil (1424) and in the “Battle of the Herrings” at Rouvay in 1429, where he used barrels of herrings to shield his troops. Although accused of cowardice in the defeat of his forces at Patay in June 1429, he was later cleared of the charge. About 1440 he retired from military service.
The papers left by his Norfolk neighbour and friend John Paston picture Fastolf as an irascible, acquisitive old man who was utterly ruthless in his business dealings. Childless, he intended to leave his possessions for pious works, but the Pastons got most of them. The bishop of Winchester, however, managed to salvage a portion for his new Magdalen College at the University of Oxford.
