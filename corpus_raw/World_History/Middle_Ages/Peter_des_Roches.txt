Peter Des Roches,   (died June 1238, Farnham, Hampshire, Eng.), Poitevin diplomat, soldier, and administrator, one of the ablest statesmen of his time, who enjoyed a brilliant but checkered career, largely in England in the service of kings John and Henry III.
As bishop of Winchester from 1205 to 1238, he organized and added to the financial resources of his see. He held ecclesiastical appointments in Touraine and Poitou and afterward went to England, where King John influenced his election to the see of Winchester. He remained in England and retained his see throughout the interdict (1208–13), filling several administrative and military roles. He became chief justiciar in 1214 but was unpopular and was replaced in June 1215. He supported John loyally during the war with the barons and was one of his executors. Peter crowned Henry III and was his tutor until 1227. As the most influential Poitevin in the country, he headed that group of alien officials and soldiers who suffered political defeat at the hands of the justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, in 1223–24. He accompanied the emperor Frederick II’s crusade (1228–29) and reached Jerusalem. In 1230 he helped to reconcile Frederick with the Pope and in 1231 negotiated a truce between Henry III and the French. On his return to England in 1231, he influenced Henry III to promote his son (or nephew) Peter des Rivaux to numerous posts and brought about Hubert’s fall in 1232. The administrative methods he advocated, however, led to baronial opposition in 1233, and in 1234 Henry III dismissed Peter des Roches from favour and Peter des Rivaux from office.
