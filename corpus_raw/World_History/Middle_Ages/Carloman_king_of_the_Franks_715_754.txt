Carloman,  (born c. 715â€”died Aug. 17, 754), Frankish prince, son of Charles Martel and brother of Pippin III the Short.
After inheriting Austrasia, Alemannia, Thuringia, and the suzerainty of Bavaria from his father, Carloman fought alone and with his brother to suppress external enemies and rebellious subjects. Concerned with reform of the church, he called on St. Boniface for help and in 742 summoned the first Frankish council in nearly 50 years; in 743 the Synod of Estinnes regulated the problem of church lands seized by Charles Martel and granted out to his vassals.
Carloman abandoned the secular life, becoming a monk first at Monte Soratte, later at Monte Cassino, in Italy.
