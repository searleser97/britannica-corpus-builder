John III, byname John the Pious,  Portuguese João o Piedoso,  (born June 6, 1502, Lisbon, Port.—died  June 11, 1557, Lisbon), king of Portugal from 1521 to 1557. His long reign saw the development of Portuguese seapower in the Indian Ocean, the occupation of the Brazilian coast, and the establishment of the Portuguese Inquisition and of the Society of Jesus.
Shortly after succeeding his father, Manuel I, John married Catherine, sister of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain, while Charles married John’s sister Isabella. These marriages paved the way for the eventual succession of Philip II of Spain to the Portuguese throne in 1580. By the Treaty of Madrid (1529), Portugal secured the Moluccas, or Spice Islands (now part of Indonesia), while recognizing Spain’s claim to the Philippines; this complemented the Treaty of Tordesillas, which divided sovereignty over the New World between the peninsular powers. In 1533 John promoted Portuguese settlement in Brazil and in 1549 set up a central government at Bahia. In India the Portuguese conquered the city of Diu (1535), and they established trade with Siam and a settlement at Macau (Macao) in China. In North Africa John III relinquished some of the costly coastal fortresses, recognizing that Portuguese interests demanded reduction of its commitments.
John III retained control of the spice trade, but profits declined and costs increased, as did the number of court pensioners and the indebtedness of the state.
Though at first favourable to Erasmus, John imposed religious orthodoxy, instituting the Inquisition in 1536. He entrusted the Jesuits with control of the College of Arts of the University of Coimbra, and they remained dominant in Portuguese education and in missionary work in Brazil and the Orient.
John III’s heir, also John, died in 1554. His grandson Sebastian, born in 1554, succeeded him in 1557 under the regency of his widow, the Spanish queen Catherine.
