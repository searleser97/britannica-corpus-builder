Nicephorus Chumnus, also spelled Nikephoros Choumnos,  (born c. 1250—died January 16, 1327, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]), Byzantine Greek scholar and statesman who left a number of writings, some still unpublished, including letters and orations on occasional philosophical and religious topics.
Chumnus went at an early age to Constantinople, where he was educated by George (Gregory) of Cyprus. He held imperial office, rose to be prefect of the secretariat, and became chief minister of Andronicus II. Toward the end of 1309 he became governor of Thessalonica [modern Thessaloníki, Greece], but his influence seems to have been overshadowed by Theodore Metochites. He took the monastic habit and name of Nathaniel shortly before his death.
Chumnus was deeply tied to the Classical tradition, insofar as it did not conflict with Christian teaching. In the lively intellectual controversies of his day he sided with the “ancients” against the “moderns”; this led to a rift with Theodore Metochites, whose ardent pursuit of mathematics and astronomy he bitterly attacked. A man of letters rather than of learning, he was typical of the more conservative element in cultured court circles of late 13th-century Byzantium.
