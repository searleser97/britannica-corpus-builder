John Talbot, 1st earl of Shrewsbury,  (born c. 1384—died  July 17, 1453, Castillon, Fr.), the chief English military commander against the French during the final phase of the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453).
The son of Richard, 4th Baron Talbot, he served in campaigns in Wales between 1404 and 1413 and as lieutenant of Ireland (1414–19), when he joined the English army in France. He fought at Verneuil in 1424 and took part in the unsuccessful siege of Orléans in 1429. Talbot’s rashness was largely responsible for the severe English defeat at Patay (June 1429), where he was taken prisoner. Released in 1433, he captured Clermont the following year. By suppressing the revolt of the Pays de Caux in 1436, he prevented Normandy from falling under French control. As a reward, King Henry VI made him marshal of France.
The mainstay of the English cause for the next five years, Talbot defeated the Burgundians near Le Crotoy (1437) and captured Harfleur (1440). In 1442 he was created earl of Salop—Shrewsbury was the name that he himself used for the title. After spending another two years (1445–47) as lieutenant of Ireland, he returned to France. Shrewsbury was captured and held hostage by the French in 1449–50; during this time the English surrendered Normandy and began to lose their hold on Aquitaine. Rushing to relieve the besieged fortress of Castillon in July 1453, Shrewsbury impetuously attacked the enemy without waiting for artillery cover. He was killed in the battle—the last of the war—and soon thereafter the English yielded almost all their French possessions.
