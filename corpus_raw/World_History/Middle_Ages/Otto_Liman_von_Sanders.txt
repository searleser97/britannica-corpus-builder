Otto Liman von Sanders,  (born Feb. 17, 1855, Stolp, Pomeraniaâ€”died  Aug. 22, 1929, Munich), German general largely responsible for making the Ottoman army an effective fighting force in World War I and victor over the Allies at Gallipoli.
Liman began his military career in 1874 and rose to the rank of lieutenant general. In 1913 he was appointed director of a German military mission charged with reorganizing the Turkish army. Up to the outbreak of World War I, he did much to improve its fighting capabilities, which had been impaired by reverses during the Balkan Wars.
In March 1915 Liman was given command of the 5th Turkish Army at Gallipoli. Assisted by Turkish commanders, he succeeded in forcing the British and Australian invasion force to evacuate the Dardanelles, thus preventing an Allied seizure of Constantinople (now Istanbul). In March 1918 he headed the 4th, 7th, and 8th Turkish armies in Syria and Palestine. For a time he held up the British advance but was forced to withdraw to Aleppo. After the armistice, he organized the repatriation of German soldiers who had served in Turkey during the war.
