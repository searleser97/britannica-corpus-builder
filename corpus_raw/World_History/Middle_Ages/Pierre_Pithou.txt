Pierre Pithou,  (born Nov. 1, 1539, Troyes, France—died  Nov. 1, 1596, Nogent-sur-Seine), lawyer and historian who was one of the first French scholars to collect and analyze source material of France’s history.
Reared as a Calvinist, Pithou received his lawyer’s robes at Paris (1560) after he had earned recognition by his essays on Roman laws. On the outbreak of the Second War of Religion against the Protestants in 1567, he fled to Sedan and later to Basel, returning to France after the Edict of Pacification (1570). After the massacre of the Huguenots (1572), he converted to Catholicism in 1573 and was named procurer general (1579) for a temporary court set up by King Henry III to render justice in the province of Guyenne.
When the Holy League for the extermination of Protestantism prevented Pithou from practicing law, he devoted himself to his researches on the history and discipline of the church. Sympathetic to the royal cause, he helped in producing Satire Ménippée (1594), a polemical tract that did much to damage the cause of the League. In the same year, he was appointed procurer general for the parliament at Paris. On the order of King Henry IV, he wrote Les Libertés de l’église gallicane (1594; “Liberties of the Gallican Church”), a work echoing the position of the French legal scholars in the conflict between the government and the Holy See; it became the basis for the declaration of the French clergy (1682) concerning the authority of the pope.
Pithou’s other historical works are Leges Wisigothorum (1579; “Laws of the Visigoths”), the first publication of the laws of the Visigoths, and Annales Francorum (1588; “Annals of the Franks”).
