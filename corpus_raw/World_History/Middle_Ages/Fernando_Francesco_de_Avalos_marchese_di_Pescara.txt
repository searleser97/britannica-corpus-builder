Fernando Francesco de Avalos, marquis di Pescara,  (born 1490, Naples [Italy]—died Dec. 2, 1525, Milan), Italian leader of the forces of Holy Roman emperor Charles V against the French king Francis I.
A pupil of the soldier of fortune Prospero Colonna, Pescara commanded Spanish forces in Italy in the struggles from 1512 to 1525 between the French on one side and the Spanish and Germans on the other. In 1512 he was wounded at Ravenna, became a prisoner of the French, and was released on the promise not to fight against them again, a promise that was to be broken many times. In subsequent engagements he defeated the Venetians at Vicenza, occupied Padua in 1514, and, once more fighting against the French, took Milan in 1521 and Genoa in 1522. After Prospero Colonna’s death in 1523, Pescara became virtual commander of Charles V’s troops in Italy, winning a victory at Romagnano (northwest of Milan) in 1524 and, the following year, his greatest battle, at Pavia (south of Milan). There, by a combination of patience and tact, he successfully led his unpaid, ill-fed, and demoralized troops against the French.
After the victory Girolamo Morone, the Milanese chancellor, tried to enlist Pescara in a plot to ally Italy with France against Charles V, offering him the crown of Naples. Pescara at first appeared to give the plan serious consideration—to learn details of the conspiracy, he later claimed. But on Oct. 14, 1525, he arrested Morone, marched on Milan, and forced the Milanese to swear allegiance to the emperor, demanding the surrender of the citadels of Milan and Cremona (southeast of Milan). The duke of Milan, Francesco Sforza, refused, whereupon Pescara besieged the Castello Sforzesco. He died, however, before the duke yielded, and on his deathbed he recommended clemency for Morone.
