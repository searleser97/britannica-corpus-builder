Ulysse Chevalier,  (born Feb. 24, 1841, Rambouillet, Fr.—died  Oct. 27, 1923, Romans-sur-Isère), French priest, scholar, and author of major bibliographical works in medieval history.
As a student under Léopold Delisle, professor of ecclesiastical history at the University of Lyon, he began work on his massive Répertoire des sources historiques du moyen âge (“Collection of Historical Sources for the Middle Ages”) published in two parts: the Bio-bibliographie, 1877–88, and the Topo-bibliographie, 1894–1903. The former contains information on all historical personages alive between the years 1 and 1500 who are mentioned in printed books, and the latter contains place-names and other information. Chevalier was himself a professor at Lyon from 1887.
