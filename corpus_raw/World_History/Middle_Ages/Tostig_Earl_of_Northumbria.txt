Tostig, earl of Northumbria,  (died Sept. 25, 1066, Stamford Bridge, Yorkshire [now in East Yorkshire], Eng.), Anglo-Saxon earl who became a mortal enemy of his brother Earl Harold, who became King Harold II of England.
Tostig was a son, probably the third, of Godwine, earl of Wessex and Kent, and in 1051 married Judith, half sister of Baldwin V, count of Flanders. In the year of his marriage he shared the short exile of his father, returning with him to England in 1052, and he became earl of Northumbria after the death of Earl Siward in 1055. By stern measures, Tostig introduced a certain degree of order into the wild northern district under his rule; this severity made him exceedingly unpopular, and in 1065 Northumbria broke into open revolt. Declaring Tostig an outlaw and choosing Morkere in his stead, the rebels marched southward and were met at Oxford by Earl Harold, who, rather against the will of King Edward the Confessor, granted their demands.
Tostig sailed to Flanders and thence to Normandy, where he offered his services to Duke William (the future William the Conqueror), who was related to Tostig’s wife and who was preparing for his invasion of England. Tostig then harried the Isle of Wight and the Kentish and Lincolnshire coasts and, after a stay in Scotland and possibly a visit to Norway, joined another invader, Harald III Hardraade, king of Norway, in the River Tyne. Together they sailed up the Humber and at Gate Fulford, near York, defeated Earls Morkere and Edwine and entered York. But his brother Harold, now king, was hurrying to the north. Taking the Norwegians by surprise at Stamford Bridge, he destroyed their army on Sept. 25, 1066, and in this battle both Tostig and the king of Norway were slain.
Tostig’s two sons apparently took refuge in Norway, and his widow Judith married Welf, duke of Bavaria.
