Al-Muktafī,  (died 908), ʿAbbāsid caliph (reigned 902–908) who prosecuted wars on several fronts vigorously in a period of disintegration of the Islamic empire.
The son of al-Muʿtaḍid, al-Muktafī ascended to the throne in 902 with somewhat more popular support than his predecessors, thanks to his liberal rule and abolition of dungeons in Baghdad. He immediately faced battle with the Qarmaṭians, a schismatic sect and political movement, and defeated them once in 903 and decisively in 907. Al-Muktafī ended the independent rule of the Ṭūlūnids in Egypt in 905. In a war against the Byzantine Empire, he defeated the general Andronicus in battles in Tarsūs and other cities. However, al-Muktafī was unable to prevent the establishment of the independent Fāṭimid dynasty in Tunisia.
