Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Paşa,  (born 1634, Merzifon, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]—died  Dec. 25, 1683, Belgrade, Serbia), Ottoman grand vizier (chief minister) in 1676–83, who in 1683 led an unsuccessful Ottoman siege of Vienna.
During the grand vizierate (1661–76) of his brother-in-law Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed Paşa, Kara Mustafa Paşa served as captain of the fleet, vizier in the State Council, and deputy grand vizier. Succeeding Fazıl Ahmed Paşa as grand vizier, he led unsuccessful campaigns against Poland and then Russia. Meanwhile, a Hungarian revolt against Habsburg rule in 1678 allowed Kara Mustafa Paşa to move against Austria. The Ottoman army, under his command, laid siege to Vienna (July 17–Sept. 12, 1683) but was defeated by the Austrian-Polish army under John III Sobieski, king of Poland. Kara Mustafa Paşa was beheaded at Belgrade that same year on orders from the sultan, and his head was brought to the sultan on a silver dish.
