John Plantagenet, duke of Bedford,  (born June 20, 1389—died  Sept. 14, 1435, Rouen, Fr.), general and statesman who commanded England’s army during a critical period in the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453) with France. Despite his military and administrative talent, England’s position in France had irreversibly deteriorated by the time he died.
The third son of King Henry IV of England (ruled 1399–1413), he was made duke of Bedford by his brother King Henry V in 1414. Between 1415 and 1422 he served as lieutenant of the kingdom three times while Henry was campaigning in France. Bedford helped relieve the besieged city of Harfleur in 1416, and he and the King were both in France at the time of Henry’s death in 1422. He then became regent for Henry’s son, the infant King Henry VI, and it was agreed that during his absence from England his brother Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, was to take over his duties.
Bedford again turned his attention to the war. By allying with Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1423, he gained control over northwestern France, and he then opened an offensive against the French king, Charles VII. On Aug. 17, 1424, Bedford won an important victory at Verneuil. Nevertheless, throughout this period he had to struggle to maintain the crucial Anglo-Burgundian alliance, which was threatened by hostility between Gloucester and Duke Philip. Furthermore, Bedford was recalled to England in 1426 to arrange a reconciliation between the warring factions led by Gloucester on the one side and the chancellor, Henry Beaufort, on the other.
Returning to France in 1427, Bedford had continual success until he was forced, under pressure from a French army led by Joan of Arc, to raise his siege of Orléans in April 1429. This setback was the turning point of the war. Thereafter, all Bedford’s energy and judgment could not keep England’s hold on France from weakening. In addition, in 1433 he discovered that his country was rapidly becoming too insolvent to prosecute the conflict. Bedford’s death came as Burgundy was in the process of abandoning the English cause and making a separate peace with France.
