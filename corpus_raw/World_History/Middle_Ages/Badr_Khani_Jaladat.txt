Badr Khānī Jāladat,  (born 1893, Maktala, Syria—died  1951, Damascus), Kurdish nationalist leader and editor who was one of the chief 20th-century spokesmen for Kurdish independence.
Jāladat, like his elder brother Surayyā, devoted his life to the cause of establishing a unified Kurdish state in the Middle East. Educated in Istanbul, he emigrated in 1912 to avoid persecution and during World War I actively supported the British. Disappointed that the British did not support the formation of a unified Kurdish state after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Jāladat settled in Syria (1919), where he joined the Kurdish émigrés. In 1927 he was appointed the first president of the Khoybun (Kurdish National League) and three years later participated in the unsuccessful Kurdish rebellion in Turkey. He became the first editor (May 1932) of the bilingual Kurdish–French review Ḥawār (“Summons”), which, together with his later illustrated publication Runahi (“Light”), promoted understanding among the diverse and often conflicting elements of the Kurdish nationalist movement and contributed to the growth of a Kurdish popular literature.
