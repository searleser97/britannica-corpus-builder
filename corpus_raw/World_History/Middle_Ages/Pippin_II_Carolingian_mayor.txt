Pippin II, also spelled Pepin, byname Pippin of Herstal, French Pépin d’Héristal,  (died Dec. 16, 714, Jupille, near Liège [now in Belgium]), ruler of the Franks (687–714), the first of the great Carolingian mayors of the palace.
The son of Begga and Ansegisel, who were, respectively, the daughter of Pippin I and the son of Bishop Arnulf of Metz, Pippin established himself as mayor of the palace in Austrasia after the death of Dagobert II in 679 and defended its autonomy against Theuderic III of Neustria and Ebroïn, Theuderic’s mayor of the palace. Defeated by Ebroïn in 680 at Lucofao (near Laon), Pippin gained his revenge on the Neustrians in 687 at Tertry (near Péronne) and became sole effective ruler of the Franks. He nevertheless retained Theuderic III on the throne and after his death replaced him with three successive Merovingian kings. After several years of warfare Pippin defeated the Frisians on his northeastern border (689) and married his son Grimoald to Theodelind, daughter of the Frisian chief Radbod. He also forced the Alemanni to recognize Frankish authority again and encouraged Christian missionaries in Alemannia and Bavaria. Charles Martel was his son.
