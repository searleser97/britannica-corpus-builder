Philippicus Bardanes, original name Vardan,  (born, Armenia—died after 713), Byzantine emperor whose brief reign (711–713) was marked by his quarrels with the papacy and his ineffectiveness in defending the empire from Bulgar and Arab invaders.
He was the son of the patrician Nicephorus of Pergamum (modern Bergama, western Turkey). Emperor Tiberius III Apsimar (ruled 698–705) exiled Vardan to the Ionian island of Cephalonia for his pretensions to the throne, but in 711 Tiberius’s rival, Justinian II, recalled him and sent him to Cherson (on the Crimean Peninsula) to suppress a revolt. Instead, he made common cause with Cherson and was proclaimed emperor under the Greek name of Philippicus. He sailed to Constantinople, gained the throne, and had Justinian and his family killed.
Philippicus was an advocate of the monothelite heresy, the belief in a single will of Christ. Even before entering Constantinople, he had ordered the picture of the Third Council of Constantinople (which had condemned monothelitism in 680) to be removed from the palace and the names of those the council had condemned restored. Patriarch Cyrus refused to support the new policy and was deposed and replaced by the more-compliant deacon John early in 712. Pope Constantine therefore refused to recognize the new emperor.
In foreign policy, Philippicus’s reign was disastrous. The Bulgarians besieged Constantinople in 712, and in 712–713 the Arabs captured several cities. On June 3, 713, military conspirators overthrew and blinded Philippicus and installed his chief secretary, Artemius, as Anastasius II.
