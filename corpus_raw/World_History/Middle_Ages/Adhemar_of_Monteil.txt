Adhémar of Monteil, also called Adhémar of Puy, Adhémar also spelled Adémar or Aimar,  (died August 1, 1098, Antioch, Syria [now Antakya, Turkey]), French bishop, papal legate, and a leader of the First Crusade.
Adhémar was bishop of Le Puy from 1077 and made a pilgrimage to the East in 1086–87. Responding to Pope Urban II’s call in November 1095 for a holy expedition to the East, he was appointed papal legate of the Crusade. Wounded and temporarily captured, he recovered and entered Constantinople (now Istanbul) with Raymond IV of Toulouse and his troops and had friendly audiences with the Byzantine emperor. With the patriarch Symeon II of Jerusalem, who was in exile in Cyprus, he appealed to the West for more Crusaders. Adhémar did not preach Western papal supremacy, despite Urban II’s plans for such a policy, but, by effectively directing many battles, as well as organizing relief for poor pilgrims and ordering repentance fasts for the Crusaders, he proved to be a forceful, unifying leader. His death in Antioch from the plague deprived the Crusade of an important voice of reason and mediator of disputes.
