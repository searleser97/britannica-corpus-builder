Stephen III (or IV),  (born 720?, Sicily—died  Jan. 24, 772, Rome), pope from August 768 to 772.
After the death in 767 of Pope St. Paul I, the papal throne was coveted by temporal rulers. Duke Toto of Nepi caused his brother Constantine (II), a layman, to be elected pope. The Lombard king Desiderius dispatched to Rome troops that killed Toto and dethroned the antipope Constantine. The Lombards then set up as pope a monk named Philip, who, in turn, was ejected. Stephen, a Benedictine priest, was elected pope on Aug. 1, 768, and was consecrated on the following August 7. He notified the Frankish rulers, Charlemagne and his brother Carloman, of his election.
Constantine had been blinded by order of the Frankish party, and Desiderius’ legate Waldipert was subsequently assassinated. In April 769 Stephen summoned a Lateran council that formally deposed Constantine. He later tried to prevent an alliance between the Frankish and Lombard kingdoms. The alliance he did accept with the Lombards in 771 led to the murder of the leaders of the Frankish party in Rome, and Carloman died before he could avenge the wrong.
In ecclesiastical matters Stephen approbated the worship of icons for the Eastern Church and extended the rights of cardinal bishops for the Western Church.
