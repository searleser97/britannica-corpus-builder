Koƈu Bey, in full Kuricali Koƈu Mustafa Bey, Kuricali also spelled Göriceli, Koƈu also spelled Koƈi,  (born, Korƈa, Ottoman Empire—died c. 1650, Constantinople), Turkish minister and reformer, a notable early observer of the Ottoman decline. Originally from Albania, Koƈu Bey was sent to Constantinople, where he was educated in the Imperial Palace. He later entered the service of a number of Ottoman sultans, finding particular favour with Murad IV (1623–40) and İbrahim I (1640–48), whose adviser he became. Koƈu Bey is best known for his treatise Risale-i Koƈu Bey (“The Treatise of Koƈu Bey”), a brilliant study of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Written during a period when the empire was beginning to encounter serious problems at home as well as abroad, Koƈu Bey’s work sheds a great deal of light on the Ottomans’ awareness of their plight. Unacclaimed at the time of their writing, this treatise and a similar later one are now regarded by scholars as some of the finest analyses of Ottoman decline.
