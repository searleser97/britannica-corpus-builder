Afonso III,   (born May 5, 1210, Coimbra, Port.—died  Feb. 16, 1279, Lisbon), fifth king of Portugal (1248–79), who supplanted his brother, King Sancho II, and completed the reconquest of the Algarve from the Muslims.
The younger son of Afonso II and Urraeca, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile, Afonso emigrated and became, by marriage, count of Boulogne. His elder brother, Sancho II, was deposed by order of the pope, who granted Afonso the crown. He returned to Portugal and was welcomed by the towns and the church. He reconquered the district of Faro in 1249 and shared the former Muslim region of Algarve with Castile.
His reign saw the first meeting of the Portuguese Cortes (parliament) in which the commoners of the municipalities were represented. Despite the help that he received from the pope in becoming king, he took the same attitude as his predecessors about the repossession of church lands and was, like them, excommunicated. On his death, he was succeeded by his son Dinis.
