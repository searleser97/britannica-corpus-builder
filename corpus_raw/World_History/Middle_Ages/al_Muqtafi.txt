Al-Muqtafī,  (born April 1096, Iraq—died  1160, Iraq), ʿAbbāsid caliph during the later years of Seljuq influence in Iraq.
Al-Muqtafī became caliph in 1136 and soon embarked upon a policy of strengthening his political authority vis-à-vis the Seljuqs, whose princes at the time were feuding among themselves. Consequently, he was able to annex one district in Iraq after another. In 1156 he recognized the Seljuq prince Sulaymānshāh as sultan, provided that the latter would respect al-Muqtafī’s autonomy in Iraq. Al-Muqtafī even supported him in some military campaigns, but, when Sulaymānshāh was defeated by his rival Muḥammad, al-Muqtafī himself was besieged in Baghdad by Muḥammad’s forces. The siege was lifted after several months, and al-Muqtafī thereafter was able to control military and political affairs in Iraq and the surrounding regions.
