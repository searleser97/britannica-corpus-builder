Sokollu Mehmed Paşa,  (born 1505, Sokol, Bosnia, Ottoman Empire—died  Oct. 11/12, 1579, Constantinople [now Istanbul, Turkey]), Ottoman grand vizier (chief minister) from June 1565, under the sultans Süleyman the Magnificent and Selim II, and perhaps the real ruler of the empire until the death of Selim in 1574. During his tenure, a war was fought with Venice (1570–73), in which the Ottoman navy was defeated in the Battle of Lepanto (October 7, 1571), but ultimately the empire secured its war aim—the acquisition of Cyprus from the Venetians.
Recruited into Ottoman service through the child-tribute (devşirme) levied in the Balkans, Mehmed rose to the rank of high admiral of the fleet (1546) and later was governor-general (beylerbeyi) of Rumelia. He commanded the forces of Selim during the conflict (1559–61) between Selim and Bayezid, sons of Süleyman, over the succession to the throne, and he married (1562) a daughter of the victorious Selim. As grand vizier, he favoured peace, opposing Ottoman entry into war with Venice and with Iran (1578). After Selim’s death, Mehmed lost much of his power and, having made a number of enemies, was assassinated.
