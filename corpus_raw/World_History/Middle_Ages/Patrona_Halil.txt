Patrona Halil,  Halil also spelled Khalil,  (died 1730), Turkish bath waiter, who, after a Turkish defeat by Persia, led a mob uprising (1730) that replaced the Ottoman sultan Ahmed III (ruled 1703–30) with Mahmud I (ruled 1730–54). This was the only Turkish rising not originating in the army. Patrona Halil was assassinated soon after.
