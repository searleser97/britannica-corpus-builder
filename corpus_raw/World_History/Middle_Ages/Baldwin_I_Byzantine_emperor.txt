Baldwin I,  (born 1172, Valenciennes, France—died 1205), count of Flanders (as Baldwin IX) and of Hainaut (as Baldwin VI), a leader of the Fourth Crusade, who became the first Latin emperor of Constantinople (now Istanbul).
The son of Baldwin V, count of Hainaut, and Margaret of Alsace, countess of Flanders, Baldwin I was an ally of the English royal house of the Plantagenets, fighting at the side of Richard I against Philip II Augustus of France. During the Fourth Crusade, which was conceived by Pope Innocent III in 1198, he took part in the installation of the pro-Latin Alexius IV Angelus as emperor in Constantinople in 1203. After Alexius and his father, Isaac II, were deposed in February 1204, the Crusaders seized power, and Baldwin, with Venetian support, was elected ruler of a new Latin state. He was crowned emperor on May 16, 1204, in the church of Hagia Sophia. The Pope, although initially shocked at the Crusaders’ pillage of Constantinople and disconcerted by their failure to consult him on the partition of the empire, quickly recognized the Latin emperor. Even his enemies conceded that Baldwin was a man of bravery, piety, and self-control.
Baldwin created a new government, based on the western European feudal model, to replace the traditional hierarchy of the Byzantine Empire. In October 1204 he enfeoffed 600 knights with lands formerly held by Greek nobles.
A Byzantine revolt in Thrace provided the Bulgarian tsar Kalojan with a pretext for invasion. Baldwin led a small force to confront him at Adrianople in March 1205. Defeated, taken prisoner, and executed by the Bulgars, he was succeeded by his brother Henry.
