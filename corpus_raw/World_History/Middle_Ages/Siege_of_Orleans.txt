Siege of Orléans,  (October 12, 1428–May 8, 1429), siege of the French city of Orléans by English forces, the military turning point of the Hundred Years’ War between France and England.
The siege was begun by Thomas de Montacute, earl of Salisbury, after the English conquest of Maine, a border region between the zone recognizing Henry VI of England as king of France and the zone recognizing the dauphin, Charles VII. But Salisbury’s enterprise was contrary to the advice of Henry VI’s regent in France, John, duke of Bedford, who argued for an advance into Anjou instead. Salisbury captured some important places upstream and downstream from Orléans, along with the bridgehead fort on the south bank of the Loire River opposite the city itself, then died of a wound on November 3, 1428. His successor in command, William de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, did nothing to promote the operation until December, when John Talbot (later earl of Shrewsbury) and Thomas Scales arrived to stimulate him. Impressive siege works, including forts, were then undertaken. Weeks went by; a French attempt to cut the besiegers’ line of supply was defeated (Battle of the Herrings, February 12, 1429); and the defenders, under Jean d’Orléans, count de Dunois (natural son of Charles VII’s late uncle Louis, duke d’Orléans), were considering capitulation when Joan of Arc persuaded Charles VII to send an army to relieve the city. Diversionary action against one of the English forts enabled Joan, from Chézy, five miles upstream, to enter Orléans with supplies on April 30. In the following week the principal English forts were stormed, and Suffolk abandoned the siege.
