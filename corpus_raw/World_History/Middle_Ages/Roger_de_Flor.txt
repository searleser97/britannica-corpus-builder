Roger de Flor,  (born c. 1267, Brindisi, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies—died April 30, 1305, Adrianople, Byzantine Empire), Sicilian-born military adventurer and mercenary captain whose service to the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II had disastrous consequences.
As a boy he went to sea and became a Knight Templar. When Acre in Palestine fell to the Saracens (1291), he made his fortune by blackmailing refugees. Denounced by his grand master, he fled to Genoa and became commander of a force of almogávares (Spanish mercenaries) in service to the Aragonese king of Sicily, Frederick II, who was warring with the house of Anjou.
In 1303, with 6,500 almogávares known as the Grand Catalan Company, he entered the service of Andronicus II and fought with some success against the Turks. His evident intention, however, to found a principality of his own, combined with the predatory activities of his army, led to his recall at the end of 1304 and to his subsequent assassination. In revenge, the mercenaries ravaged Thrace, the hinterland of the Byzantine capital.
