Archibald Douglas, 4th earl of Douglas, byname Tyneman,  (born c. 1369—died  Aug. 17, 1424, Verneuil, Fr.), Scottish commander in the Scottish and French wars with the English in the early 15th century.
Son of the 3rd earl, Archibald the Grim, he married Margaret, daughter of the future Robert III of Scotland. As master of Douglas (1400) he defeated Sir Henry Percy (“Hotspur”) and George Dunbar, earl of March near Preston, and acquired the lands that March thus forfeited. When the other lands were restored (1409) he retained the lordship of Annandale. Archibald was, with the regent, Robert, duke of Albany, suspected of compassing the Duke of Rothesay’s death (March 1402) while he was in their custody at Falkland; but both were declared guiltless by Parliament.
In a raid upon England Archibald was captured by Percy at the Battle of Homildon Hill (September 1402); he fought with his captors against Henry IV at the Battle of Shrewsbury (1403) and was taken prisoner by the English king. He was allowed to visit Scotland several times after 1405, negotiating between the Scots and English for the release of the Scots king James I, who had been captured by the English (1406) while sailing to France. Archibald was finally freed in 1413.
He commanded a contingent of 10,000 Scots sent to help the French king Charles VII against the English and was made lieutenant general of the French army. Archibald received the peerage-duchy of Touraine with remainder to his male heirs. He was killed fighting against John, duke of Bedford, at the Battle of Verneuil and was buried in Tours cathedral.
