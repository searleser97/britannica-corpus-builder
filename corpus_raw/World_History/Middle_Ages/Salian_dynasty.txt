Salian Dynasty,   royal and imperial line that came to power with the election of a Salian Frank, Conrad of Swabia, as German king, after the Saxon dynasty of German kings and Holy Roman emperors died out in 1024. Conrad (Conrad II) was crowned Holy Roman emperor in 1027, obtained suzerainty over the kingdom of Burgundy, and reasserted German power in Italy. He began the policy of imperial reliance on a new class of officials, the ministerials, men of low rank closely attached to the crown.
His son and successor, Henry III (reigned 1039–56), inherited three of the five German stem (tribal) duchies. He augmented his power of possession with the use of the ministerials, close cooperation with German churchmen, and virtual control of the papacy and thereby formed the strongest central government in the history of the medieval German empire. Henry’s son succeeded him as Henry IV (reigned 1056–1106) at age six. After a minority, troubled by the conflicting ambitions of lay and ecclesiastical magnates, the young king became engaged in a struggle with the reformed papacy under Pope Gregory VII (reigned 1073–85), who sought to free the church from any dependence on the emperor for its German lands. Their dispute over the control of appointments to ecclesiastical office initiated nearly two centuries of papal-imperial conflict. After Gregory excommunicated him and had him dethroned in 1076, Henry came to terms with the pope at Canossa (January 1077). Henry IV had to meet many revolts of German princes; the last, in 1105, was led by his son, who succeeded him as Henry V. During his reign (1106–25), Henry V made peace with the papacy. The Salian line became extinct when he died without an heir.
