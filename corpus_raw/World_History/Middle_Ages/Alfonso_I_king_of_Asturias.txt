Alfonso I, byname Alfonso The Catholic,  Spanish Alfonso El Católico,  (born 693?—died  757, Cangas, Galicia), king of Asturias from 739 to 757, probably the son-in-law of the first Asturian king, Pelayo. The rebellion of the Berber garrisons in Islāmic Spain (741) and the civil strife there that followed gave him the opportunity to incorporate Galicia into his kingdom. He also campaigned far to the south of the Asturian mountains, but lack of manpower made it impossible to exert permanent control on the plains and, in his time, a wide, largely uninhabited no-man’s-land came into being between Asturias and the settled territories of the emirate of Córdoba.
