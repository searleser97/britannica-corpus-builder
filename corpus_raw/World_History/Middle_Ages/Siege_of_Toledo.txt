Siege of Toledo,  (1085). The Siege of Toledo was a key moment in the struggle between the Christians and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula. The city was the capital of the Taifa kingdom of al-Andalus and its fall to King Alfonso VI of Castile spurred the Reconquista, the Christian conquest of Muslim Spain.
Toledo was the prosperous capital of the Moorish kingdom of al-Andalus, commanding a strategic position in the center of the Iberian Peninsula. Throughout its history, al-Andalus had been in conflict with Christian kingdoms in the north and the tide began to turn in the Christians favor after Alfonso became king of Leon in 1065 and of Castile in 1072.
Alfonso carefully and cleverly exploited divisions within Moorish Spain. In 1075 he defeated the Taifa kingdom of Granada with the help of their rivals in Seville, and later that year, he supported Toledo against its rivals in Córdoba. However, Alfonso lost his influence in Toledo when Al-Qadir succeeded his father as caliph (Muslim head of state) and expelled Alfonso’s sympathizers.
Al-Qadir’s actions caused further divisions within the Moorish community; a rebellion lost him Córdoba and sent him into exile, and he was forced to ask Alfonso for assistance. The king agreed on the condition that Al-Qadir give up Toledo to Castile in return for the Moors holding onto Valencia. By the time Alfonso’s forces arrived at Toledo, the citizens were tired of conflict and invited him to enter. However, a faction linked to the kingdom of Zaragoza resisted and forced Alfonso to besiege the city.
The ultimate fall of Toledo in May 1085—after four years of mostly desultory military activity—was a significant milestone in the Reconquista of Muslim Spain, allowing King Alfonso to claim the leadership  of Spain for Leon-Castile.
