Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Paşa,  (born 1637, Vezirköprü, Anatolia, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]—died  Aug. 19, 1691, Slankamen, Serbia), Ottoman vizier and then grand vizier (1689–91) who helped overthrow the sultan Mehmed IV but was himself killed in the disastrous Battle of Slankamen (1691).
Fazıl Mustafa Paşa was the second son of the grand vizier Köprülü Mehmed Paşa. He received a theological education, but he spent most of his early years on military service with his brother Fazıl Ahmed Paşa, the next grand vizier. After his brother’s death (1676) the grand vizierate went to a brother-in-law, Kara Mustafa, whose failure to take Vienna (1683) in the great siege caused the collapse of the whole imperial edifice that the first two Köprülüs had erected. Fazıl Mustafa Paşa, who had been vizier since 1680, had to resign. Later, however, when another brother-in-law, Siyâvuş, became grand vizier, Fazıl Mustafa Paşa was made second vizier (Oct. 2, 1687), and they both played a major role in deposing Mehmed IV. But soon rebels turned against them, and Fazıl Mustafa Paşa saved his life only with the protection of the new sultan, Süleyman II.
In 1689, when the Austrian army advanced in the Balkans, Fazıl Mustafa Paşa was called to the grand vizierate. In the campaign of 1690 he liberated Nish and Belgrade from occupation; he was killed fighting an imperial army under Louis of Baden at Slankamen; Fazıl Mustafa Paşa was mortally shot while rushing to support his right wing. It fell to Mehmed Paşa’s nephew Amca-zâde Hüseyin Paşa, grand vizier between Sept. 13, 1697, and Sept. 29, 1702, to conclude the peace treaty with the allies at Carlowitz (Jan. 26, 1699).
