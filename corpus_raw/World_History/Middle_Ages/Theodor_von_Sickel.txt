Theodor von Sickel,  (born Dec. 18, 1826, Aken, Prussian Saxony [now Aachen, Ger.]—died  April 21, 1908, Merano, Austria), German historian of the early European Middle Ages who is considered the founder of modern diplomatics, the critical method for determining the authenticity of documents.
Educated at the École des Chartes de Paris (1850–52) and in Berlin, Sickel, on grants from the French government, carried out research projects at the archives at Milan, Venice, and Vienna. He was appointed professor of history at Vienna (1867), later becoming director of the Institute for Austrian History (1869) and the Austrian Historical Institute in Rome (1883–1901). His principal works were the Acta regum et imperatorum Karolinorum, 2 vol. (1867), an examination of Carolingian documents still valuable for the study of the period, and Beiträge zur Diplomatik, 8 vol. (1861–62; “Contribution to Diplomatics”), a treatise on the science of interpreting records. Sickel also was associated with the direction of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, writing in that series “The Diplomacy of Conrad I, Henry I, and Otto II” (1879–84).
