Nicetas Choniates, Nicetas also spelled Niketas,  (born c. 1155, Chonae, Byzantine Empire [now in Turkey]—died 1217, Nicaea, Empire of Nicaea [now İznik, Turkey]), Byzantine statesman, historian, and theologian. His chronicle of Byzantium’s humiliations during the Third and Fourth Crusades (1189 and 1204) and his anthology of 12th-century theological writings constitute authoritative historical sources for this period and established him among the most brilliant medieval Greek historiographers.
Nicetas, a protégé of his brother Michael, archbishop of Athens, served as a district governor in Philippopolis (now Plovdiv, Bulgaria), where he witnessed the Crusaders’ ravages under Frederick I Barbarossa. He later experienced the looting of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1204 by the Crusaders from the West. Forced to flee Constantinople, Nicetas moved to Nicaea, site of the Byzantine court-in-exile, and wrote the 21-volume History of the Times, a record of the rise and fall of the 12th- and 13th-century Byzantine dynasties, beginning with the Greek emperor John Comnenus (1118–43) and concluding with the intrusion of the first Latin Eastern emperor, Baldwin I of Flanders (1204–05).
A fervent Greek Byzantine nationalist, Nicetas produced a generally objective and concrete, although rhetorical, account of the Crusaders’ campaigns in Byzantium.
In the theological sphere Nicetas composed the Panoplia Dogmatike (“Thesaurus of Orthodoxy”), a collection of tracts to use as source material for responding to contemporary heresies and to document the 12th-century Byzantine philosophical movement.
