Childebert I,  (born c. 498?—died  Dec. 23, 558, Paris), Merovingian king of Paris from 511, who helped to incorporate Burgundy into the Frankish realm.
Childebert was a son of Clovis I and Clotilda. He received lands in northwestern France, stretching from the Somme down to Brittany, in the partition of his father’s kingdom in 511; to these he added part of the kingdom of Orléans in the 520s (by the murder of his brother Chlodomer’s young heirs), part of the kingdom of Burgundy in 534 (by conquest, with his brother Chlotar I), and Provence in 536 (by treaty from the Ostrogoths). After a campaign in 531 against the Visigoths, who still held the coastal strip between the Rhône and the Pyrenees, he invaded Spain itself in 542 in alliance with Chlotar; although the expedition had no great success, he did bring back with him the tunic of the martyred St. Vincent, housing this in a new foundation at Paris that came to be called Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Childebert left no sons, and his lands were taken over by Chlotar on his death.
