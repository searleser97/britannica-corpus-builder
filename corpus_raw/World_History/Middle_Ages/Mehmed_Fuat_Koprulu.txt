Mehmed Fuat Köprülü, also known as Köprülüzade,  (born Dec. 5, 1890, Constantinople—died  June 28, 1966, Istanbul), scholar, historian, and statesman who made important contributions to the history of Turkey and its literature.
A descendant of the famous 17th-century Ottoman prime ministers (grand viziers), Köprülü began teaching at the famous Galatasaray Lycée (secondary school) in Constantinople and in 1913 occupied the chair of Turkish literature at Istanbul University. Later he became dean of the Faculty of Letters there and founder and first director of the Türkiyat Enstitüsü (Institute of Turkology).
Turning to politics in 1936, he became a member of Parliament and finally foreign minister (1950–54). A brilliant and prolific scholar, he exerted influence in Turkish intellectual circles even after his death. He wrote many books on Turkish literature and history, among them Türk edebiyatǐnda ilk mutasavvǐflar (1919; “The First Mystics in Turkish Literature”), a penetrating analysis of the confluence of Central Asian and Islāmic streams of mysticism and its subsequent effect on Turkish literature; and a masterly revision of earlier American and European historians’ theories of the rise of the Ottoman Empire, Les Origines de l’empire Ottoman (1935; “The Origins of the Ottoman Empire”).
