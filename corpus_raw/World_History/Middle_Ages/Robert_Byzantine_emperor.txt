Robert, byname Robert Of Courtenay,  (died 1228, Morea), Latin emperor of Constantinople from 1221 to 1228. He was so ineffective that the Latin Empire (consolidated by his uncle, Henry of Flanders) was largely dissolved at the end of his reign.
Robert was a younger son of Peter of Courtenay (died early 1219?) and Yolande of Flanders and Hainaut, who was empress regent for her sons until her death in September 1219. Their eldest son, Philip of Namur, refused to leave France and renounced the succession in favour of Robert, an irresponsible youth, who was crowned in Constantinople on March 25, 1221. Robert was betrothed to Eudocia, daughter of the Greek emperor at Nicaea, Theodore I Lascaris. In 1225 Theodore’s successor, John III Vatatzes, forced Robert to cede most of the eastern lands of his Latin Empire in Asia Minor, and by 1228 Theodore Angelus, ruler of Epirus, a city-state in Asia Minor, seized Thessalonica and was crowned emperor there. In the meantime Robert had repudiated Eudocia and taken a French mistress, who was mutilated in the ensuing revolt by Robert’s own barons. He died while fleeing to take refuge with Pope Gregory IX.
