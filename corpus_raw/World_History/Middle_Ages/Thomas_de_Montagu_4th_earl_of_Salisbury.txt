Thomas de Montagu, 4th earl of Salisbury,  Montagu also spelled Montacute,  (born 1388—died  Nov. 3, 1428, Meung, Fr.), English military commander during the reigns of Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI.
The son of John, the 3rd earl, who was executed in 1400 as a supporter of Richard II, Thomas was granted part of his father’s estates and summoned to Parliament in 1409, though not fully restored until 1421. He was present throughout the campaign of Agincourt in 1415 and at the naval engagement before Harfleur in 1416. In 1420 he was in chief command in Maine, and, when Henry V went home the next year, Salisbury remained in France as the chief lieutenant of Thomas, duke of Clarence. The Duke, through his own rashness, was defeated at Baugé on March 21, 1421. Salisbury came up with the archers too late to retrieve the day but recovered the bodies of the dead and by a skillful retreat averted further disaster.
Salisbury’s success in Maine marked him out as a chief lieutenant in the French war after Henry’s death. Subsequent operations completed the conquest of Champagne, leaving him to be employed on the Norman border and in Maine. After a year’s visit to England he returned to the chief command in the field in July 1428. He determined to make Orléans his principal objective, and began the siege on October 12. On October 27, while surveying the city from a window in the castle of Tourelles he was wounded by a cannon shot and died a few days later. Salisbury was the most skillful soldier on the English side after the death of Henry V.
