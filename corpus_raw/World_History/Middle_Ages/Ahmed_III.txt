Ahmed III,  (born Dec. 30, 1673, Bulgaria, Ottoman Empire—died July 1, 1736,  Constantinople [now Istanbul], Turkey), sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1703 to 1730.
The son of Mehmed IV, he succeeded to the throne in 1703 upon the deposition of his brother Mustafa II. Ahmed III cultivated good relations with England and France and afforded refuge at his court to Charles XII of Sweden after his defeat by Peter I the Great of Russia at the Battle of Poltava (1709). Ahmed declared war on Russia in 1710 and came nearer than any other Turkish sovereign to breaking that country’s power. His grand vizier, Baltaji Mehmed Pasha, encircled Peter’s army near the Prut River in July 1711, and Russia had to agree to restore the town of Azov to Turkey, to destroy the Azovian forts, and to abstain from interference in Polish or Cossack affairs. (Turkish discontent at the leniency of these terms nearly brought on a renewal of the war in late 1712.) In 1715 Ahmed directed the capture of the Morea (Peloponnesus) from the Venetians, but when Austria intervened, the Turks suffered reverses, losing Belgrade in 1717. Under the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), which Ahmed made, Turkey retained its conquests from the Venetians but ceded Hungary and part of Serbia to Austria.
In 1724 Turkey and Russia reached an agreement to partition much of Iran between them. The Iranians drove the Turks out of Iran in 1729–30, however, and news of this defeat sparked a popular uprising in Turkey led by Patrona Halil in which Ahmed was deposed. He died in captivity in 1736.
Ahmed’s reign is sometimes known as the Tulip Age (Lâle Devri) because of the popularity of that flower in Constantinople in the early 18th century. With Ahmed’s encouragement, art and literature flourished during this time.
