Johan Huizinga,  (born Dec. 7, 1872, Groningen, Neth.—died  Feb. 1, 1945, De Steeg), Dutch historian internationally recognized for his Herfsttij der middeleeuwen (1919; The Waning of the Middle Ages).
Huizinga was educated at the universities of Groningen and Leipzig. After teaching history in Haarlem and lecturing in Indian literature at Amsterdam, he was professor of history first at Groningen (1905–15) and then at Leiden until 1942, when he was held as a hostage by the Nazis. He remained under open arrest until his death.
His first works dealt with Indian literature and cultures, but he established his reputation with The Waning of the Middle Ages, which examines life and thought in France and Holland in the 14th and 15th centuries. The book’s lively and well-modulated style makes it literature as well as history, as is also true of Erasmus (1924), a sympathetic study of a central intellectual figure of the 16th century. Huizinga’s other chief works are In de schaduwen van Morgen (1935; In the Shadow of Tomorrow), “a diagnosis of the spiritual distemper of our time,” and Homo Ludens (1938), a study of the play element in culture.
