Romanus II,  (born 939—died  963), Byzantine emperor from 959 to 963. The son of Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, Romanus was a politically incapable ruler who left affairs of state to the eunuch Joseph Bringas and military affairs to Nicephorus Phocas; Nicephorus became emperor after Romanus’ death with the help of Romanus’ widow, Theophano.
