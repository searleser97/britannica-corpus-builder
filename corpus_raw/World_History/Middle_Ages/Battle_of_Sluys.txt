Battle of Sluys,  (24 June 1340). In 1337, Edward III of England laid claim to the French throne, thus starting the lengthy series of conflicts known as the Hundred Years’ War. The first major contact between the two sides was a naval battle off the coast of Flanders. England’s victory ended the threat of a French naval invasion and brought it dominance of the English Channel.
In June 1340 a large English fleet commanded by Edward III set sail across the Channel to assert his claim to the French throne. Opposing him was a large French fleet, reinforced with galleys from Genoa, that was drawn up in the inlet of Sluys in Flanders. The French placed their fleet in a defensive position, their anchored ships lashed together with cables to create a floating platform on which to fight. The Genoese commander, Egidio Bocanegra, known as Barbavara, kept his galleys free behind the French lines. In response, the English placed one of their ships filled with knights and swordsmen between two ships packed with longbowmen. Ships of both sides were filled with soldiers because, at this time, naval battles were only fought on the restrictive confines of the ships’ decks.
Battle started at around noon and continued for most of the day and night. Both sides used grappling hooks to hold an enemy ship fast while it was boarded, but it was the English who eventually got the better of the battle. This was because their ships were free to attack the anchored French ships as and when required, and also because their longbowmen produced a more rapid and accurate rate of fire than the French and Genoese crossbowmen. The result was a disaster for the French, with almost all their 190 ships captured or sunk and both their commanders killed. Only the Genoese managed to gain something, seizing two English ships.
Losses: English, 2 ships captured of 210; French and Genoese, 170 ships captured or sunk of 190.
