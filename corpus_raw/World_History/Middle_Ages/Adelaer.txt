Adelaer, also spelled Adeler (Norwegian: “Eagle”),  byname of Cort, or Curt, Sivertsen, Italian Curzio Suffrido,  (born Dec. 16, 1622, Brevik, Nor.—died  Nov. 5, 1675, Copenhagen, Den.), Norwegian-born seaman and naval officer, distinguished in both Venetian and Danish naval history.
He entered the Dutch navy in 1639 as an adelborst (“cadet”) and served under Martin van Tromp but in 1642 moved into Venetian service, where he was known as Curzio Suffrido Adelborst. He soon distinguished himself and in 1650 was sent to patrol the Dardanelles. On May 16, 1654, his Venetian squadron took part in the Battle of the Dardanelles, when his ship alone sank 15 Turkish galleys; and on the following day he compelled the surrender of the Turks at Tenedos. In 1659 he was made a knight of St. Mark and given a pension for life, and in 1660 he became lieutenant admiral of the Venetian fleet.
Two years later, in 1662, he returned to Denmark as admiral of the Danish fleet, receiving at the same time various honours and revenues from King Frederick III. His most important work was the refitting and reorganization of the fleet. In 1665 he received an invitation to command the Dutch fleet against England, but this he refused. He was ennobled by Frederick III in 1666 and was sent to India to negotiate with the court of Coromandel three years later (1669–70). Under Christian V he was appointed to command the Danish fleet against Sweden but died before the expedition.
