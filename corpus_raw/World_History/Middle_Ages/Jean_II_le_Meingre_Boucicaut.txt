Jean II le Meingre Boucicaut,  (born c. 1366—died  1421, Yorkshire, Eng.), marshal of France, French soldier, and champion of the ideals of chivalry.
He was the son of Jean I le Meingre (d. 1368), also called Boucicaut and likewise a marshal of France. After the younger Boucicaut had served in several campaigns, Charles VI made him a marshal in 1391. During an expedition to Hungary in 1396, he was captured at Nicopolis (now Nikopol, Bulgaria) and ransomed by the Turks. In 1399, with troops and a fleet from the West, he defended the Byzantine Empire by defeating a Turkish fleet at Gallipoli and preventing the capture of Galata. After holding off the Turks from Constantinople for a year, he returned to France for volunteers. He was sent instead to strengthen the French administration in Genoa, which he temporarily secured after a skirmish with Venice; the Genoese, however, ousted the French in 1409 while Boucicaut was away.
Founder of the Dame Blanche à l’Écu Vert (“White Lady of the Green Shield”), an order to defend the female relatives of absent knights, he was skilled in the tournament. Boucicaut was taken prisoner in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 and died in England.
