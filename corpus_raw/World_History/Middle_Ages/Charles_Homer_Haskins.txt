Charles Homer Haskins,  (born Dec. 21, 1870, Meadville, Pa., U.S.—died  May 14, 1937, Cambridge, Mass.), American educator and a leading medievalist of his generation, known for his critical studies of Norman institutions and the transmission of Greco-Arabic learning to the West.
After receiving his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, in 1890, Haskins taught at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and in 1902 was appointed professor of history and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. In that position he helped to establish the pattern of graduate training in history that is now generally accepted.
As a leading member of the Inquiry, a body set up by Pres. Woodrow Wilson during World War I to consider the settlement of territorial problems after the war, Haskins was subsequently attached to the American delegation at the Paris Peace Conference (1919), at which he advanced the solution that was accepted for the disposition of the Saarland.
Haskins’ most important work, Norman Institutions (1918), was an epochal treatment of the 11th–12th-century institutions of Normandy and their contributions to medieval English government. It had been preceded by his more popular treatment of the subject, The Normans in European History (1915). His writings on the transmission of Greek and Arabic learning to western Europe are outstanding evaluations of 12th–13th-century scholarship and are summarized in Studies in the History of Mediaeval Science (1924) and Studies in Mediaeval Culture (1929). These works appeared in popular form as The Renaissance of the Twelfth Century (1927).
