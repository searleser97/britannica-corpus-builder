Jean-Baptiste de La Curne de Sainte-Palaye,  (born June 6, 1697, Auxerre, France—died March 1, 1781, Paris), French medievalist and lexicographer, who planned and began publication of a comprehensive glossary of Old French.
The son of a gentleman of the household of the duc d’Orléans, La Curne was elected, because of the value of his first works, to the Académie des Inscriptions in 1724. He then devoted himself to historical studies. He returned to Paris in 1726 and presented to the Académie monographs on Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, engaging himself from then onward in medieval studies. La Curne became director of the Académie des Inscriptions in 1754, and in 1758 he was elected to the Académie Française after publishing a brochure in 1756 outlining his ambitious plan for a glossary of Old French. The first volume of the work was ready for the press in 1780, but publication was delayed first by La Curne’s death and then by the French Revolution (1787–99). The whole work finally appeared as Dictionnaire historique de l’ancien langage françois, ou glossaire de la langue françoise depuis son origine jusqu’au siècle de Louis XIV (10 vol., edited by L. Favre and M. Pajot; 1875–92), with a life of La Curne in the 10th volume.
