Pippin I, also spelled Pepin, byname Pippin of Landen or Pippin the Elder, French Pépin de Landen or Pépin le Vieux, German Pippin der Ältere,  (died 639 or 640), councillor of the Merovingian king Chlotar II and mayor of the palace in Austrasia, whose lands lay in the part of the Frankish kingdom that forms part of present-day Belgium. The reference to Landen dates from the 13th century.
Through the marriage of his daughter Begga with Ansegisel, son of Arnulf (d. 641; bishop of Metz), Pippin was the founder of the Carolingian dynasty. Deprived of his mayoralty at the accession (629) of Dagobert I, he regained power in Austrasia after that king’s death (January 639) but did not long survive to enjoy it.
