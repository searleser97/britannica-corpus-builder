Ferdinand Lot,  (born September 20, 1866, Paris, France—died July 20, 1952, near Paris), French historian of the early Middle Ages and the later Roman Empire. He is best known for his important monographs on the transition from Roman to medieval civilization.
Lot taught at the École Pratique des Hautes Études (1900), later becoming professor at the University of Paris (1909). He was also, for many years, the director of the École de Chartes. His work on the diplomatic and narrative texts of the high Middle Ages appeared as Études sur le règne de Hugues Capet et la fin du Xe siècle (1903; “Studies on the Reign of Hugh Capet and the End of the 10th Century”). He also wrote Les Invasions barbares et le peuplement de l’Europe (1937; “The Barbarian Invasions and the Populating of Europe”); L’Art militaire et les armées du moyen âge (1946; “Military Art and the Armies of the Middle Ages”); and many other works on medieval philology, demography, and Romanesque literature. Lot’s best-known and most influential work was La Fin du monde antique et le début du moyen âge (1927; The End of the Ancient World and the Beginning of the Middle Ages, 1931). He received many honours, including membership in the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and the Legion of Honour.
