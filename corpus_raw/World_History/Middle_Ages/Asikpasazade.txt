Aşıkpaşazâde, also called Aşiki, original name Dervis Ahmet Ibn Şeyh Yahya Ibn Şeyh Salman Ibn Aşik Paşa,  (born 1400, Amasya, Ottoman Empire [now in Turkey]—died after 1484, Constantinople [now Istanbul]), one of the most important early Ottoman historians. The great-grandson of the famous mystic poet of Anatolia, Aşık Paşa, Aşıkpaşazâde also had affiliations with a Muslim mystical order.
Very little is known about his early life. In 1413 he claimed to have met Yahşi Fakih, whose early Ottoman history he utilized when writing his own many years later. About 1437 he made the pilgrimage to Mecca, and, during the reigns of the Ottoman sultans Murad II (1421–51) and Mehmed II (1451–81), the historian took part in Ottoman raids on Christian lands in the Balkans. Later, in Constantinople, he recorded the events he had either seen or heard about in his active and long life. His popular Tevârih-i Âl-i Osman (“The Chronicles of the House of Osman”), written in a vivid and simple narrative style, was meant, no doubt, to be read aloud. At the end of many chapters there are questions and answers as though to clarify the material for the listener. Although the source for the first half of the work is the history of the above-mentioned Yahşi Fakih and a continuation of that work, the rest is what Aşıkpaşazâde recorded from his own experience over the years. It is an invaluable source for early Ottoman history.
