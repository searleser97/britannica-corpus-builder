Concert of Europe,  in the post-Napoleonic era, the vague consensus among the European monarchies favouring preservation of the territorial and political status quo. The term assumed the responsibility and right of the great powers to intervene and impose their collective will on states threatened by internal rebellion. The powers notably suppressed uprisings in Italy (1820) and Spain (1822) but later condoned Belgiumâ€™s rebellion and proclamation of independence (1830).
Made obsolete in its original form by the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 and by the subsequent unifications of Italy and Germany, the Concert of Europe survived for most of the 19th century in the consultations among the great powers on territorial questions.
