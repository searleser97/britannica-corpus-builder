Minsk, in full Minskaya Voblasts,  voblasts (province), central Belarus. It extends from the rolling, morainic hills of the Belarusian Ridge in the northwest across the Byarezina plain, which slopes gently to the southeast. The natural vegetation is dense forest of pine, spruce, oak, and birch, and alder in wetter areas, but on the uplands most of the forest has been cleared for agriculture, with consequent gully erosion. In the south and east, grass marsh and peat bog are extensive. The economy is dominated by the capital city, Minsk. Apart from Barysaw and the vehicle-making centre of Zhodzina, the towns are small and are engaged in processing timber and local farm produce. Cultivation of rye, wheat, buckwheat, barley, and flax is chiefly concentrated on the uplands and around Slutsk in the south, and dairying is widespread. The chief industries are machine and instrument building (automobiles, tractors, lathes, motorcycles, televisions, and radio receivers). In the 1960s large deposits of potassium salts at Starobin began to form the base for fertilizer production in Salihorsk. This area has become one of the most important potash-producing centres in Europe. Area region, 14,800 square miles (38,300 square km); region and city, 15,750 square miles (40,800 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) region, 1,461,800; region and city, 3,275,800.
