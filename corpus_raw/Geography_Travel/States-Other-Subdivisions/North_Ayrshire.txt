North Ayrshire,  council area, southwestern Scotland, along the Firth of Clyde. It encompasses part of the historic region of Cunninghame on the Scottish mainland, in the historic county of Ayrshire, as well as several islands in the Firth of Clyde, including the Cumbraes and the Isle of Arran, which belong to the historic county of Buteshire. The islands’ economies depend on tourism fostered by the unspoiled mountain scenery, abundant reserves of game and fish, and, especially, their proximity to metropolitan Glasgow. Livestock raising is also important on Arran. The economy of mainland North Ayrshire reflects a contrast between the urbanized coastal plain and the more rural and agricultural interior. Agricultural activities include dairy farming and the cultivation of vegetable crops in the southern and eastern lowlands and hill sheep farming in the northern uplands. Along the coast there is a mix of industrial, commercial, and service activities; manufacturing has a strong presence, with notable paper milling, glass production, and pharmaceutical companies. Food and drink processing, particularly whisky distilling on the Isle of Arran, also represents a significant economic sector. Largs is a coastal resort known for its Viking heritage, and Ardrossan’s waterfront developments and ferry service draw visitors as well. Hunterston, near West Kilbride, is the site of a deepwater port, a nuclear power station, and wind turbine developments. As the commercial hub of North Ayrshire, the “new town” of Irvine supports a wide range of retail and manufacturing activities. Irvine is also the administrative centre of the council area. Area 342 square miles (885 square km). Pop. (2001) 135,817; (2011) 138,146.
