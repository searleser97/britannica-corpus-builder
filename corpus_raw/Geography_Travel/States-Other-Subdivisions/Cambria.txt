Cambria,  county, central Pennsylvania, U.S. It consists of a mountainous region on the Allegheny Plateau, with the Allegheny Mountains along the eastern edge. The principal waterways are the Conemaugh and Little Conemaugh rivers, Glendale Lake, and Beaverdam Run, in addition to Clearfield, Stony, and Blacklick creeks. Parklands include Prince Gallitzin and Laurel Ridge state parks.
The county was created in 1804; its name was derived from an ancient name for Wales. Johnstown, the largest city, developed into a major steelmaking and coal-mining centre after becoming the western terminus of the Allegheny Portage Railroad (1834–54), which transported Pennsylvania Canal barges across the Allegheny Mountains. A national historic site near Cresson commemorates the railroad. The Johnstown flood (May 31, 1889), considered one of the worst natural disasters in American history, caused more than 2,200 deaths and widespread property damage. Subsequent floods have claimed many lives despite flood control and safety measures such as an inclined-plane cable-pulled railway that was built in 1891 to transport residents to high ground. The railway rises 500 feet (150 metres) at a 71 percent grade.
Other communities are Westmont, Nanty Glo, Portage, and Ebensburg, which is the county seat. In addition to services and retail trade, the county’s economic activities include steelmaking and bituminous coal mining. Area 688 square miles (1,782 square km). Pop. (2000) 152,598; (2010) 143,679.
