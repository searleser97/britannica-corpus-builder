Terengganu, formerly Trengganu,  traditional region of northeastern West Malaysia (Malaya), bounded by those of Kelantan (north and northwest) and Pahang (south and southwest). It has a 200-mile- (320-kilometre-) long coastline along the South China Sea (east). Terengganu is mentioned in 1365 as a vassal of the Javanese kingdom of Majapahit. The sultanate of Terengganu, ruled by members of the same family since 1701, was under Thai suzerainty until a treaty in 1909 made it a British protectorate and one of the unfederated Malay states. After World War II it joined the Federation of Malaya (1948).
One of the least developed regions on the Malay Peninsula, Terengganu consists of a string of coastal settlements, usually at the mouths of the area’s many rivers, the longest of which is the Terengganu. High, forest-clad mountains, in places exceeding 7,000 feet (2,100 m) in height, have deterred inland settlement. Except for a small airstrip at its chief settlement, Kuala Terengganu (formerly Kuala Trengganu), the region is linked only by road and coastal shipping with the rest of the peninsula. For about four months a year, these links were often broken by heavy seas and flooding from the monsoon rains, but construction of a new bridge in the 1970s eliminated that problem.
The inhabitants are predominantly Muslim Malays engaged in fishing and paddy (rice) farming. Small rubber and coconut plantations are scattered among the paddy fields. The once-productive iron-ore mines near Kuala Dungun were closed in 1970. There is a large oil-palm plantation inland at Jerangau, 36 miles (58 km) south of Kuala Terengganu. Rice, although widely grown, is also imported, usually from Thailand. Terengganu’s exports include iron, rubber, copra, and salted and dried fish.
