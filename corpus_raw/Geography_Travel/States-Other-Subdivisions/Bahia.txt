Bahia,  estado (state) of eastern Brazil. It is bounded by Piauí and Pernambuco states to the north, by Alagoas and Sergipe states to the northeast, by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, by Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais states to the south, and by Goiás and Tocantins states to the west. The capital, Salvador, is a port situated at the southern tip of the peninsula that separates Todos os Santos (All Saints) Bay, a deep natural harbour, from the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese first entered the region in 1501, through the bay where Salvador is now located, and they called the area Bahia (“Bay”), whence the state derives its name. Area 218,029 square miles (564,693 square km). Pop. (2010) 14,016,906.
The Diamantina Upland and its northern extension, the Tombador Mountains, run north across Bahia from the borders of Minas Gerais and constitute the line of greatest elevation. The Diamantina reaches its maximum elevation at Almas Peak (6,070 feet [1,850 metres]). From the east and west of this dorsal ridge descend plateaus that vary in elevation between about 650 and 2,600 feet (200 and 800 metres) and are characterized by inselbergs (steep-sided, isolated hills that have been left by erosion). The eastern edge of the highlands terminates in the hills overlooking the coastal plain.
The major river is the São Francisco, which rises in Minas Gerais and flows north across western Bahia before turning eastward in a great curve to form the frontier between Bahia and Pernambuco and between Bahia and Alagoas, on its long way down to the Atlantic Ocean. Flowing directly to the coast are several minor rivers, which originate in the Diamantina Upland or in the Espinhaço Mountains of Minas Gerais.
Along Bahia’s coastline there are areas where annual rainfall exceeds 55 inches (1,400 mm). In the dry interior zone, which occupies most of the land area and virtually the entire northwestern half of the state, the rainy season is irregular, and the annual rainfall never exceeds 24 inches (610 mm).
The mangabeira rubber tree flourishes along Bahia’s coastline, while mangroves grow in estuaries. The sandy clay soil of the narrow coastal plain supports broad-leaved evergreen tropical forests. The zone of transitional forest to the west consists of deciduous shrubs and smaller plants. The dry zone’s landscape is open and bare, and plants such as cactus predominate.
Peccaries, tapirs, and two-toed sloths live in the forests. In the interior, giant armadillos, scarlet ibises, and king vultures can be found.
Bahia’s population includes a pronounced mulatto majority (of mixed European and African lineage) and sizable African and European minorities. Population density varies considerably. The greatest concentrations of Bahia’s population reside in the cities and towns of its eastern coastal area, particularly in the Recôncavo, the fertile region surrounding Todos os Santos Bay. Salvador is the largest city (its historic centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985); other urban centres include Ilhéus, Itabuna, Feira de Santana, Vitória da Conquista, Camaçari, Jequié, and Alagoinhas. The arid interior, on the other hand, is sparsely populated and has relatively few towns, with Barreiras in the west and Juazeiro in the north being the most important.
The main language of Bahians is Portuguese, but it is influenced to some extent by African and various indigenous languages. Roman Catholicism is professed by the overwhelming majority of the population, and the cardinal archbishop of Salvador is also the primate of Brazil. Protestantism, spiritualism, and other religions are practiced. Many Bahians practice the rituals of Candomblé, a syncretist religious sect.
Bahia is the major exporter of northeastern Brazil. The bulk of Bahia’s industry is centred in the Salvador metropolitan area, and agriculture is the main occupation of Bahians in the interior. At the onset of the 21st century, tourism increased in importance. In general, however, a lack of infrastructure and the state’s isolation from major markets have been hindrances to economic growth.
Bahia’s agriculture was severely threatened by recurring droughts in the latter part of the 20th century, but irrigation has ameliorated this problem. Crops grown in Bahia include sugarcane, cassava (manioc), soy, corn (maize), cotton, cacao (the source of cocoa beans), and sisal. Cattle are raised in many parts of the state for their leather and skins as well as for their meat. In the early 21st century, agriculture accounted for less than one-tenth of the state’s economic activity.
Among Bahia’s mineral resources are petroleum, natural gas, lead, copper, chrome, tin, barite, manganese, magnesite, titanium, hematite, quartz, kaolin, marble, asbestos, and amethyst. There is also a vast hydroelectric potential in the state: the São Francisco River has been harnessed by the Sobradinho, Itaparica, Paulo Afonso, and Xingó dams in Bahia and the neighbouring state of Alagoas.
Bahia is a major producer of paper, foodstuffs, cellulose, cement, and iron. An automotive plant and a concentration of petrochemical industries are centred on the city of Camaçari.
Like other Brazilian states, Bahia is semiautonomous, with its own constitution, justice system, and directly elected governor and legislative assembly. The poverty rate of the state is among the highest in Brazil, and many of the rural poor do not have access to health facilities. Salvador has two major universities—the Federal University of Bahia (1946) and the Catholic University of Salvador (1961).
