Atlántico,  departamento, northwestern Colombia, located on the Caribbean coastal plain and bounded east by the Magdalena River. The department was established in 1905.

Cotton and sesame are the principal commercial crops grown in the district. Cattle are raised, and fishing is important. Area 1,308 square miles (3,388 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 2,227,713.
