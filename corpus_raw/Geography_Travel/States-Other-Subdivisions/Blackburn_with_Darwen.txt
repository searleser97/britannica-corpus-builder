Blackburn with Darwen,  unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Lancashire, northwestern England, 23 miles (37 km) northwest of Manchester.
The famous weaving tradition of the town of Blackburn had its beginnings in the 13th-century wool trade. By the reign of Elizabeth I, Blackburn was a flourishing market town of 2,000 people, with Irish flax being utilized in the production of fabrics. The introduction of the spinning jenny (invented by James Hargreaves about 1764 at nearby Stanhill) and other textile machinery speeded cotton spinning, while the Leeds and Liverpool Canal (completed 1816) aided transport and was a useful source of water. The abundance of coal, lime, and building materials also helped expansion. Textiles remain important, but there is now a wide diversity of industry, including electronics, engineering, and brewing. The Lewis Textile Museum records the development of the textile industry.
Darwen developed especially after the Industrial Revolution, with cotton spinning and weaving, coal mining, and paper manufacturing. Wallpaper is important, and engineering and paint and plastics manufacturing have been developed.
The unitary authority encompasses an area of open moorland and forest south of Darwen. In this area stands Turton Tower, a mansion completed in the 16th century, with a museum of furniture and weapons. Area 53 square miles (137 square km). Pop. (2001) 137,470; (2011) 147,489.
