Namangan,  oblast (province), eastern Uzbekistan, in the northern part of the Fergana Valley. It is traversed by the Syr Darya, the Severny (Northern) Fergana irrigation canal, and the Great Namangan Canal. The economy is predominantly agricultural. Because of the dry climate, almost all crops are grown on irrigated land along the Syr Darya and in the river valleys of the Chatkal Mountains. Much of the sown acreage is under cotton; grain, fruit, vegetables, grapes, and fodder are also cultivated, and sericulture (raw-silk production) is important. The pasturelands are poor, but sheep, goats, and cattle are raised, primarily in the west. Industry is concentrated in the capital, Namangan.
