Orleans,  county, northern Vermont, U.S., bordered to the north by Quebec, Canada, and to the west by the Green Mountains.

The region, abundant in wildlife, is wooded with spruce, fir, white pine, and maple. Recreational areas include Crystal Lake State Park and Willoughby and Jay Peak state forests.
Orleans county was created in 1792 and probably was named for Louis-Philippe-Joseph, duc d’Orléans. The city of Newport, the county seat, developed as a railroad and logging centre.
