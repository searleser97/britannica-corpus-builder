Northland,  regional council, the northernmost of North Island, New Zealand. It is coextensive with most of the North Auckland Peninsula. Northland extends about 96 miles (250 km) northwest from Kaipara Harbour to Cape Reinga and North Cape and is bounded to the west by the Tasman Sea and to the east by the Pacific Ocean.
The North Auckland Peninsula, which is no more than 50 miles (80 km) wide, is generally at a lower elevation than the rest of North Island but rises to about 2,500 feet (760 metres) in the volcanic Tutamoe and Maungataniwha ranges. The peninsula’s western shore is sandy and indented by the large but shallow Hokianga and Kaipara harbours. On the peninsula’s east coast the shoreline is rocky, with good anchorages in Parengarenga and Rangaunu harbours, Doubtless Bay, Bay of Islands, and Bream Bay.
Northland is relatively undeveloped. Livestock is raised, and towns, with the exception of Whangarei, are small. Maori constitute a large proportion of the region’s population. Area 5,324 square miles (13,789 square km). Pop. (2006) 148,470; (2012 est.) 158,400.
