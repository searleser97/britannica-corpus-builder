Saratov,  oblast (region), western Russia, in the basin of the middle Volga River, which bisects it northâ€“south. Saratov city is the administrative centre.
Most of the right- (west-) bank area is occupied by the Volga Upland, which is greatly dissected by river valleys and erosion gullies; the left (east) bank is a low, rolling plain that formed the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic until 1941, when that administrative unit was abolished for security reasons. The oblast has a dry, continental climate, with frequent droughts. Rainfall amounts to only about 15 inches (380 mm) annually. Nevertheless, the presence of fertile chernozem soils has brought about the plowing up of almost all the grass-steppe vegetation on the west-bank area, thereby accelerating soil erosion. The east-bank area is dry steppe, with conditions increasingly resembling semidesert to the southeast, where sagebrush partly replaces the grass.
Agriculture, concentrating heavily on grains, cattle, and sheep, is well developed in the oblast despite recurrent droughts, and industry greatly expanded after 1940, especially along the Volga. Wheat, corn (maize), and rye are the chief crops, and millet, sunflowers, mustard, melons, potatoes, and other vegetables are also grown. Livestock raising is important in the eastern part of the oblast. Natural gas and some petroleum are obtained near Yelshanka and Stepnoye and have stimulated the growth of oil-refining, chemical, and engineering industries in the cities of Saratov, Engels, Balakovo, and Balashov. Other, smaller cities are chiefly concerned with processing agricultural products (flour milling, distilling, and the extraction of vegetable oil). Area 38,700 square miles (100,200 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) 2,583,808.
