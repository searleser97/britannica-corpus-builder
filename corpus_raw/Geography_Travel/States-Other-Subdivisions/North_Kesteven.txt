North Kesteven,  district, administrative and historic county of Lincolnshire, east-central England, south of the city of Lincoln. Sleaford, in the southeast, is the district’s administrative centre.
North Kesteven district is partly low-lying alluvial plain and partly fens (reclaimed marshland), both usually lower than 100 feet (30 metres) in elevation. It is split in the west-central part by the narrow limestone plateau of the Lincoln Edge that extends northward from low hills, rises above 200 feet (60 metres), and has a steep western scarp. Gradually descending to the east, the almost treeless plateau has a few scattered villages built of stone.
Both sides of the narrow plateau are agriculturally productive, but the fens in the southeast, having been drained and systematically irrigated, are more intensively cultivated. Crops grown (especially in the southeast) include cereals (barley and wheat), potatoes, and assorted market-garden produce. Limestone is quarried near the village of Blankney. A principal industry at Sleaford is the malt brewery, housed in a 1,000-foot- (300-metre-) long structure built in 1900. Other industries in the district manufacture agricultural machinery and electrical equipment.
The Royal Air Force College Cranwell near Sleaford provides specialized training for air force officers. Examples of Decorated Gothic (1250–1375) church architecture are found throughout the district. An old inn at Sleaford contains a carved stone depicting the now illegal sport of bullbaiting. Area 356 square miles (923 square km). Pop. (2001) 94,024; (2011) 107,766.
