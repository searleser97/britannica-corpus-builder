Antofagasta,  región, in an extremely arid part of northern Chile, bounded on the east by Bolivia and Argentina and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. Antofagasta is the second largest of Chile’s regions; about 98 percent of its population lives in urban areas, chiefly the capital city of Antofagasta, and in Tocopilla, Calama, and Chuquicamata.
Occupied in 1879 by Chilean forces early in the War of the Pacific, it was ceded by Bolivia in 1884 and created a Chilean province in 1888 and a region in 1974. It includes the provinces of Tocopilla, Antofagasta, and El Loa. The population grew greatly after the discovery of nitrate deposits in 1866, mainly in the Pampa del Tamarugal, lying between the coastal range and the volcanic Andes. After World War I, nitrate prices fell, and the population declined. Copper mining is now the main economic activity; from the region comes more than 50 percent of Chile’s copper production, especially from Chuquicamata and La Escondida. Borax, sulfur, iodine, molybdenum, lithium carbonate, gold, and silver are also important mineral resources. It is the leading region in road and railroad mileage and is linked with the rest of Chile and with Oruro, Bolivia, and Salta, Argentina. Area 48,668 square miles (126,049 square km). Pop. (2017) 607,534.
