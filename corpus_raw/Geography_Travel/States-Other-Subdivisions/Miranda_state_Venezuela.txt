Miranda,  estado (state), northern Venezuela, bounded by the Caribbean Seaon the northeast, by the Venezuelan states of Guárico on the south and Aragua on the west, and by the federal district. The state is named in honour of Francisco de Miranda, a revolutionary who helped to pave the way for independence in Latin America.
The mountainous northern and southern parts of the territory are separated by the Tuy River, which flows eastward to the Caribbean. Miranda ranks high among Venezuelan states in agricultural and pastoral production, and government irrigation projects have resulted in the expansion of its large-scale farming and in the diversification of its agriculture. Almost half of the nation’s cacao is grown around the Barlovento region of Miranda and neighbouring Anzoátegui, in the Tuy valley. Coffee plantations cover the higher elevations, while sugarcane, citrus trees, vegetables (including avocados), and bananas thrive on the valley floor. The state also produces cotton, corn (maize), peanuts (groundnuts), cassava, oranges, taro,  and coconuts. Tourism and fishing also contribute to the economy.
Miranda has a high rural population density, and the city of Caracas has expanded into neighbouring parts of northwestern Miranda. The highway network is extensive. Los Teques, the state capital and major industrial centre, lies on the Pan-American Highway. Area 3,070 square miles (7,950 square km). Pop. (2001) 2,330,872; (2011) 2,675,165.
