Argolís,  perifereiakí enótita (regional unit), periféreia (region) of Peloponnese (Modern Greek: Pelopónnisos), southern Greece. It is a narrow, mountainous peninsula projecting eastward into the Aegean Sea between the Saronikós Gulf (to the northeast) and the Gulf of Argolís (Argolikós Kólpos; to the southwest). Bordered on the north by Kórinthos (Corinth) and on the west by the mountains of Arcadia (Arkadía), it has been inhabited since Neolithic times. A limestone plateau comprises the highland areas of Argolís, while its lowland plain is alluvial and fertile, though too dry to cultivate without irrigation. The main natural vegetation is macchie, but with cultivation the land supports vegetables, olives, citrus, and grapes. On the coast trees are cultivated for resin. Goats and sheep are raised, especially for milk, which is used in the production of cheese.
The Argolid is an archaeological treasure house and thus a tourist trade centre: Mycenae (Mykínes) was the home of Agamemnon, Tiryns the birthplace of Heracles, Epidaurus (Epídavros) the home of an ancient healing cult. In ancient times the Gulf of Argolís gave Greece access to trade and exchange of ideas from Crete and Egypt. The city of Árgos gave its name to the plain; Nauplia (Návplio) is a seaport and seaside resort. It was also the first capital of an independent Greece in the 19th century. Area 832 square miles (2,154 square km). Pop. (2001) 102,392; (2011) 97,044.
