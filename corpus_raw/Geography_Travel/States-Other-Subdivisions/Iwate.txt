Iwate,  ken (prefecture), northeastern Honshu, Japan, bordering the Pacific Ocean (east). The greater part of its area is mountainous—dominated by the central Kitakami Mountains—and the climate is cold. The fishing port of Miyako on the eastern coast serves as the gateway to Rikuchū Coast National Park, which includes some rugged, scenic shoreline. The western fringe of the prefecture is part of Towada-Hachimantai National Park.
Agriculture, forestry, mining, and fishing support most of the population. Rice paddies occupy more than half the cultivated land, yielding only one crop per year. Morioka, located on the Kitakami River, is the prefectural capital and the site of Iwate University (1949). A major railway hub, the city produces ironware and charcoal. The first modern ironworks in Japan were in the coastal city of Kamaishi, south of Miyako. Other cities—including Hanamaki, Kitakami, Ōshū (formerly Mizusawa), and Ichinoseki—are situated in the central lowland area along the Tōhoku railway line.
On March 11, 2011, Iwate was struck by a severe earthquake (magnitude 9.0) centred offshore to the south in the Pacific Ocean. Although the temblor and subsequent aftershocks caused some damage in the prefecture, the powerful tsunami generated by the quake produced much greater destruction as it inundated large portions of Iwate’s coastal areas. Among the hardest-hit cities were Miyako, Ōtsuchi, Kamaishi, and Ōfunato. In addition to massive property damage in the affected areas (including more than 24,000 buildings that were wholly or partially destroyed), nearly 6,000 people were killed or were missing and presumed dead. Area 5,899 square miles (15,278 square km). Pop. (2010) 1,330,147.
