Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes,  région of east-central France created in 2016 by the union of the former régions of Auvergne and Rhône-Alpes. It encompasses the départements of Allier, Puy-de-Dôme, Cantal, Haute-Loire, Loire, Rhône, Ain, Haute-Savoie, Savoie, Isère, Drôme, and Ardèche. It is bounded by the régions of Centre and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté to the north, Nouvelle-Aquitaine to the west, and Occitanie and Provence–Alpes–Côte d’Azur to the south. Italy and Switzerland adjoin to the east. The capital is Lyon.
In June 2014 French Pres. François Hollande announced a plan to reduce the number of régions in metropolitan France from 21 to 13. The reorganization was designed to address redundancies in regional bureaucracies and to reduce costs. In November 2014 the National Assembly approved the measure, and it took effect on January 1, 2016. The région of Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes was thus created, encompassing a large portion of east-central France. Area 22,176 square miles (69,711 square km). Pop. (2015 est.) 7,877,698.
