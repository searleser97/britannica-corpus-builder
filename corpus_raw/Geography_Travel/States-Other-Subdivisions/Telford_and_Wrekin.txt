Telford and Wrekin, also called Wrekin,  unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Shropshire, west-central England, in the east-central part of the county. The unitary authority, drained in the south by the River Severn, is a plain covered by glacial drift soils in the north. Historically important iron-manufacturing industrial villages are scattered along the Shropshire Hills in the south. The town of Telford is the administrative centre.
The unitary authority takes its name from the Wrekin, which is a 1,334-foot (407-metre) hill near its southwestern border, and from adjacent Telford town. Telford, a planned new town, extends across a number of industrial villages (including Dawley, Madeley, Ironbridge, Coalport, Coalbrookdale, Wellington, and Oakengates) and encompasses nearly one-third of the unitary authority’s total area. Historical firsts of the area’s iron industry are the smelting of iron with coke (1709), the first iron bridge (cast in Coalbrookdale in 1774 and built at Ironbridge in 1779), and the first iron boat (1787); all are commemorated in a museum of industrial archaeology at Coalbrookdale. The region centred on Ironbridge was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986.
Contemporary iron foundry manufactures of the villages include steel furniture, automotive components, and stoves. The northern part of the unitary authority is mostly rural and agricultural, and cattle and cereals are raised near the northeastern market town of Newport. Area 112 square miles (290 square km). Pop. (2001) 158,325; (2011) 166,641.
