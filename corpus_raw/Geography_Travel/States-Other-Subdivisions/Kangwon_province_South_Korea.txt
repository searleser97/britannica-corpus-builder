Kangwŏn, also spelled Gangwon,  do (province), northeastern South Korea. It is bounded to the east by the East Sea (Sea of Japan), to the south by North Kyŏngsang (Gyeongsang) and North Ch’ungch’ŏng (Chungcheong) provinces, to the west by Kyŏnggi (Gyeonggi) province, and to the north by Kangwŏn province, North Korea. Prior to the division of the Korean peninsula after World War II, the two Kangwŏn provinces were a single entity, but that larger province was split between North and South Korea, first at latitude 38° N (the 38th parallel) in 1945 and then, following the Korean War armistice (1953), by the truce line (demilitarized zone); most of the original province is now in South Korea.
The T’aebaek Mountains nearly reach the sea, and the contour of the coastline is steep and smooth. Of the province’s total area, four-fifths is woodland that contains forest products such as edible alpine plants and mushrooms. Mineral resources include iron, coal, tungsten, fluorite, and limestone. Other industries have been created by the development of hydroelectric and thermoelectric power plants. The nearby waters abound in fish, especially cuttlefish and pollack. Cities in the province are Ch’unch’ŏn (Chuncheon), the provincial capital; Kangnŭng (Gangneung); Wŏnju; and Sokch’o. Both Mount Sŏrak (5,604 feet [1,708 metres]), with a ski run, and Mount Odae (5,128 feet [1,563 metres]) are in national parks in the T’aebaek range. In 2009 a cluster of royal tombs of the Chosŏn (Joseon) dynasty (1392–1910) in southern Kangwŏn were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site along with other such tombs located in Kyŏnggi province and in Seoul. In July 2011 P’yŏngch’ang (Pyeongchang), in the south-central region of the province, was selected as the location of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. Area 6,414 square miles (16,613 square km). Pop. (2010) 1,471,513.
