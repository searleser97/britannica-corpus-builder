Smolensk,  oblast (region), western Russia. The oblast lies mostly in the upper Dnieper River basin. The terminal moraines of the Smolensk-Moscow Upland lie east-west across the oblast, rising to 1,050 feet (320 m) and dividing the Dnieper, Volga, and Western Dvina basins. Easy portages between these basins have made the area a focal route since earliest times. The natural vegetation of mixed forest has been largely cleared for agriculture and now covers less than one-fifth of the surface, but there are many swamp areas of peat bog and grass marsh in valleys and hollows amid the hummocky morainic relief. Agriculture is dominated by flax cultivation, potato growing, and dairying. There are widespread and long-established linen-making, timber-working, and food-processing industries, with engineering in the larger towns. Smolensk city is the administrative centre. Area 19,200 square miles (49,800 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) 983,227.
