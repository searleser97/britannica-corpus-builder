Huelva,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Andalusia, southwestern Spain. It is bordered by the Guadiana River and Portugal to the west and by Sevilla province to the east. The province’s mountainous northern portion (Sierra de Aracena) gives way in the south to the flat, fertile La Campiña, or lowland, which stretches to the Atlantic. The estuaries of the Odiel and the Tinto, the main rivers of the province, join to form the ría (inlet) at the provincial capital, Huelva city.
Dry farming (cereals) predominates, but cultivation of cotton, olives, fruit trees, and strawberries for export is also important. The use of greenhouses has increased in the early 21st century. The local mineral deposits have been exploited since ancient times, and the Riotinto copper and pyrite mines near Nerva are world famous. The tuna-fishing industry supports many preserving and salting factories. Tourism along the sunny Costa de la Luz greatly increased after 1960. Important cities in the province include the capital, Huelva, and Ayamonte, Lepe, and Moguer. Area 3,910 square miles (10,128 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 497,671.
