Wear Valley,  former district, administrative and historic county of Durham, northeastern England, in the northwestern part of the county. Lying mostly within a section of the Pennines, Wear Valley is predominantly a high, bleak limestone upland, 1,000 to 2,300 feet (305 to 700 metres) in elevation, that descends gradually to the east and is drained from west to east by the River Wear. The upper Wear valley, called Weardale, is confined by steep walls. At the former districtâ€™s eastern edge the river emerges from the Pennines onto a less-restricted arable plain 200 to 400 feet (60 to 120 metres) in elevation, where most of the population is concentrated.
Wear Valley was historically important as a lead-, ironstone-, limestone-, and especially coal-mining area of Great Britain. Many villages in the eastern part of the area were established in the 19th century adjacent to the hillside locales of the coalpits, which were then extensively worked (mostly for coking). The area  suffered severe unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and coal production has since ceased. Many of the inhabitants are now employed at light industrial estates near the towns of Bishop Auckland, Crook, and Willington. There are steelworks at Wolsingham. Fluorspar and limestone deposits are worked in Weardale, but the greatly prized, gray-black Frosterley marble is now quarried only for special orders. Hardy breeds of sheep (particularly Swaledale) graze the uplands, and dairy cattle, cereals, potatoes, and fodder crops are raised in the lower Wear Valley. The hilly western part of the area, around Weardale, is noted for its natural beauty, which attracts many tourists. Weardale is popular with campers, hikers, and trout fishermen. The commercial centre is Bishop Auckland.
