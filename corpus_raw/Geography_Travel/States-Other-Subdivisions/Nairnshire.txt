Nairnshire, also called Nairn,  historic county, northeastern Scotland, on the southern shore of the Moray Firth. The town of Nairn is the historic county town (seat) and the principal town.
Part of the sandy shore of the Moray Firth has been forested, and the county’s coastal area is for the most part fertile and well-farmed with crops and livestock. Inland the highland plateaus, with summits rising to about 2,000 feet (600 metres), are dissected by the River Findhorn. Salmon fishing in the county’s streams has seriously declined. There are few industries apart from whisky distilling, granite quarrying, and tourism. The town of Nairn is a popular seaside resort.
The area was originally inhabited by the Picts, who had been subdued and Christianized by the 9th century ad. Nairn subsequently became part of the kingdom of Scotland and was included in the ancient Scottish province of Moray. The county’s history thenceforth is merged with that of Moray. The town of Nairn stands on the border between the traditionally Gaelic Scottish Highlands and the English-speaking North Sea coast, and at one time Gaelic was spoken in the town’s southwest end and English at its northeast end. Notable antiquities in the county include Cawdor and Rait castles.
