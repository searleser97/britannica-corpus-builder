Ulster,  county, southeastern New York state, U.S., bordered by the Hudson River to the east and the Catskill Mountains to the northwest. The varied terrain is drained by the Wallkill and Neversink (west and east branches) rivers; lakes include Ashokan Reservoir.

The dominant forest types are oak and hickory in the southeast; maple, birch, and beech in the centre; and white, red, and jack pine in the northwest.
Algonquian-speaking Indians, such as the Delaware, were early inhabitants of the region. Ulster, one of the original New York counties, was created in 1683. It was named for the traditional Irish province of Ulster, then under the control of James, duke of York and Albany (later King James II). Kingston, the county seat, was the first capital of New York state (1777) and the eastern terminus of the Delaware and Hudson Canal (completed 1828). New Paltz contains six houses built by the first settlers along Huguenot Street (1692–1712), one of the oldest American streets with its original houses. The State University of New York College at New Paltz was founded in 1828. Other communities are Saugerties and Ellenville.
