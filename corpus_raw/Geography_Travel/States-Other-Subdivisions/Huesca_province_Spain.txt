Huesca,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Aragon, northeastern Spain. It is bordered by France to the north, Lleida province to the east, and Zaragoza province to the south and west. In the north Huesca province includes the highest point in the Pyrenees, Aneto Peak (11,169 feet [3,404 metres]). Above 8,000 feet (2,440 metres) there is alpine vegetation, giving way at lower elevations to fir and pine and then to beech, chestnut, and oak. This isolated, sparsely settled region provides summer pasturage for livestock. Ordesa and Mount Perdido National Park, on the border with France, has magnificent mountain scenery and woodland; the area, including adjacent portions of France, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1997. The mountains and valleys of the Pyrenean foothills lead into the irrigated fertile southern plains of the Cinca, Flumen, and Ebro river valleys, where an agricultural economy predominates, producing grain (barley, rice, and corn [maize]) as well as alfalfa (lucerne), peaches, and pears. Pig raising is also important.
The provincial capital, Huesca city, has limited industry. The cities of Monzón and Sabiñánigo have chemical and metallurgical plants. Hydropower for the Barcelona grid, mainly from the Cinca river system, is significant. The energy resources of the province were enlarged by the discovery in 1979 of natural gas at Sabiñánigo. The service sector has grown in importance. Area 6,037 square miles (15,636 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 220,107.
