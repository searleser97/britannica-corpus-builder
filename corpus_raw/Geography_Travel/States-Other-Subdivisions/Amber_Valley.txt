Amber Valley,  district, administrative and historic county of Derbyshire, England, to the north of Derby. It takes its name from the River Amber, which joins the Derwent at Ambergate.
The industrial eastern half of the district contrasts with the still rural western portion. Traditionally, coal mining and ironworking were the staple industries, but, from the late 1950s, industrial diversification took place as mining declined in importance. Some of the derelict mining land has been reclaimed for new industrial estates, notably near Alfreton, one of the four market towns of Amber Valley; the others are Belper, Heanor, and Ripley. Engineering is important at Ripley and Belper, which is also a centre of the cotton and hosiery industry. Codnor Gate Business Park, just outside Ripley, is the site of one of the world’s leading doll house retailers, The Dolls House Emporium. Jedediah Strutt, inventor of a stocking ribbing machine, built the town’s first cotton mill in 1776. Among buildings of interest are the picturesque remains of Wingfield Manor House, begun in 1440 and dismantled in 1646. Area 102 square miles (264 square km). Pop. (2001) 116,471; (2011) 122,309.
