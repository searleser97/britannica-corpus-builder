Chang-hua, Pinyin Zhanghua,  county (hsien, or xian), west-central Taiwan. Chang-hua city, in the north of the county, is the administrative seat.
The county is bordered by the special municipality T’ai-chung (Taizhong) to the north, the counties Nan-t’ou (Nantou) and Yün-lin (Yunlin) to the east and south, respectively, and the Taiwan Strait to the west. Its northern and southern boundaries are roughly parallel to the Wu and Cho-shui (Zhuoshui) rivers, respectively. The Pa-kua (Bagua) Mountains, a western extension of the Chung-yang (Zhongyang) Range, are in the southeast. The rest of the region is a fertile alluvial deltaic plain.

Livestock and poultry are also raised. Rice and sugar milling, weaving, paper and hat making, sawmilling, and food canning are the major industries. Marble deposits are worked.

The region has many Confucian and Buddhist temples and relics.
