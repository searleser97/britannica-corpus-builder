Imo,  state, southern Nigeria. Imo is bordered by the states of Anambra to the north, Abia (until 1991 part of Imo state) to the east, and Rivers to the south and west. The British first entered the territory in 1901, when they established a military post in the region. Imo consists of coastal lowlands to the east of the Niger River. Most of the stateâ€™s original tropical rain forest vegetation has been replaced by more open areas of oil-palm bush.
