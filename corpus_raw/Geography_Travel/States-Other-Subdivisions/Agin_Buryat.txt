Agin Buryat, also called Aga,  former autonomous okrug (district), southeastern Russia; in 2008 it merged with Chita oblast (region) to form Zabaykalye kray (territory). The Agin Buryat area is situated along the left bank of the lower Onon River, a headstream of the Amur. The district was formed in 1937 for an exclave group of the Buryat people, who live chiefly east and south of Lake Baikal, although by the late 20th century they constituted only about half of the population (the remainder being mostly Russian). The western half of the area is forested hilly country, and the eastern half is steppe lowland. There are no towns, but there are several urban districts, including Aginskoye, the administrative centre. Large herds of cattle and sheep are kept, and spring wheat and oats are grown. Area 7,300 square miles (19,000 square km). Pop. (2005 est.) 73,500.
