Yaroslavl,  oblast (region), western Russia. It lies in the upper Volga River basin. Most of the oblast is a low plain traversed by the Volga River and broken only by the low, morainic Danilov and Uglich uplands, which run northeast–southwest across it. In the northwest is the 1,768-square-mile (4,579-square-kilometre) Rybinsk Reservoir on the Volga; most of the reservoir lies within the oblast. The oblast’s natural vegetation is forest of spruce, pine, oak, maple, and ash, with many patches of swamp and with floodplain meadows along the rivers. Agriculture is dominated by dairying, and the region is noted for its cheeses; flax, oats, fodder crops, and vegetables are also grown. Textile manufacture, timber working, and food processing are widespread in the towns, with engineering and chemical industries in the two main centres, Yaroslavl city (oblast headquarters) and Rybinsk. Power is supplied by the Rybinsk hydroelectric station. The centre of Yaroslavl city was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2005. Area 14,100 square miles (36,400 square km). Pop.
