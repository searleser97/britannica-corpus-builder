Rajasthan,  state of northwestern India, located in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is bounded to the north and northeast by the states of Punjab and Haryana, to the east and southeast by the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, to the southwest by the state of Gujarat, and to the west and northwest by the provinces of Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan. The capital city is Jaipur, in the east-central part of the state.
Rajasthan, meaning “The Abode of the Rajas,” was formerly called Rajputana, “The Country of the Rajputs” (sons of rajas [princes]). Before 1947, when India achieved independence from British rule, it comprised some two dozen princely states and chiefships, the small British-administered province of Ajmer-Merwara, and a few pockets of territory outside the main boundaries. After 1947 the princely states and chiefships were integrated into India in stages, and the state took the name Rajasthan. It assumed its present form on November 1, 1956, when the States Reorganization Act came into force. Area 132,139 square miles (342,239 square km). Pop. (2011) 68,621,012.
The Aravalli (Aravali) Range forms a line across the state running roughly from Guru Peak on Mount Abu (5,650 feet [1,722 metres]), near the town of Abu in the southwest, to the town of Khetri in the northeast. About three-fifths of the state lies northwest of that line, leaving the remaining two-fifths in the southeast. Those are the two natural divisions of Rajasthan. The northwestern tract is generally arid and unproductive, although its character shifts gradually from desert in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land toward the east. The region includes the Thar (Great Indian) Desert.
The southeastern area lies at a somewhat higher elevation (330 to 1,150 feet [100 to 350 metres]) than its northwestern counterpart; it also is more fertile and has a more-diverse topography. The hilly tract of Mewar lies in the southern region, while a broad plateau stretches across the southeast. In the northeast a rugged badlands region follows the line of the Chambal River. Farther north, the landscape levels out into flat plains that are part of the alluvial basin of the Yamuna River.
The Aravallis form Rajasthan’s most-important watershed. To the east of the range, the Chambal River—the only large and perennial stream in the state—and other waterways generally drain toward the northeast. The principal tributary of the Chambal, the Banas River, rises in the Aravallis near the great Kumbhalgarh hill fort and collects all the drainage of the Mewar plateau. Farther north, the Banganga, after rising near Jaipur, flows east toward the Yamuna before disappearing. The Luni is the only significant river west of the Aravallis. It rises near the city of Ajmer in central Rajasthan and flows some 200 miles (320 km) west-southwest into the Rann of Kachchh in Gujarat state. Northeast of the Luni basin is an area of internal drainage characterized by salt lakes, the largest of which is Sambhar Salt Lake. Farther to the west lies the true Marusthali (“Land of the Dead”), the barren wastelands and areas of sand dunes that form the heart of the Thar Desert.
In the vast, sandy, and arid northwestern region, soils are predominantly saline or alkaline. Water is scarce but is found at a depth of 100 to 200 feet (30 to 60 metres). The soil and sand are calcareous (chalky). Nitrates in the soil increase its fertility, and cultivation is often possible where adequate water supplies are made available.
The soils in central Rajasthan are also sandy; clay content varies between 3 and 9 percent. In the east the soils vary from sandy loam to loamy sand. In the southeast they are in general black and deep and are well drained. In the south-central region the tendency is toward a mixture of red and black soils in the east and a range of red to yellow soils in the west.
Rajasthan has a wide range of climate that varies from extremely arid to humid. The humid zone spans the southeast and east. Except in the hills, the heat during the summer is intense everywhere, with temperatures in June—the warmest month—typically rising from the mid-80s F (about 30 °C) to nearly 110 °F (low 40s C) daily. Hot winds and dust storms occur in the summer, especially in the desert tract. In January—the coolest of the winter months—daily maximum temperatures range from the upper 60s to the mid-70s F (low to mid-20s C), while minimum temperatures are generally in the mid-40s F (about 7 °C). The western desert has little rain, averaging about 4 inches (100 mm) annually. In the southeast, however, some areas may receive almost 20 inches (500 mm). Southeastern Rajasthan benefits from both the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal branches of the southwest (summer) monsoon winds, which bring the bulk of the annual rainfall.
The predominant vegetation of Rajasthan is scrub jungle. Toward the west there are typical arid-zone plants, such as tamarisk (genus Tamarix) and false tamarisk (genus Myricaria). Trees are scarce, limited mostly to small, scattered forest areas in the Aravallis and in the eastern part of the state. Less than 10 percent of Rajasthan is under forest cover.
A number of notable large mammals are regular residents of Rajasthan. Tigers are found primarily in the Aravallis. Leopards, sloth bears, Indian sambar (dark brown Indian deer), and chital (spotted deer) occur in the hills and forests. Nilgais (bluebucks; large antelope) are also found in parts, and blackbucks are numerous in the plains. Common birds include snipes, quail, partridges, and wild ducks; they occur everywhere except in the desert. The northwestern part of the state is well known for several species of sandgrouse.
Numerous sanctuaries and wildlife parks have been established in the state. Among the most important of those are Sariska National Park (established 1955), near Alwar in the northeast; Desert National Park (1980), near Jaisalmer in western Rajasthan; and Keoladeo Ghana National Park (1981), in the eastern part of the state near Bharatpur—the latter designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985.
