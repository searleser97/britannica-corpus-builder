Van Diemen’s Land,  (1642–1855), the southeastern Australian island colony that became the commonwealth state of Tasmania. Named for Anthony van Diemen, governor general of the Dutch East Indies, the island was first encountered by Europeans in 1642 and named by Abel J. Tasman, a celebrated navigator under van Diemen’s command. The first British settlers in the early 19th century retained the name. After being a part of the colony of New South Wales since 1803, Van Diemen’s Land became a separate colony in 1825. The colonists’ aggressive, bellicose efforts to expand their control of the island resulted in protracted conflict that pitted the settlers and British military against Tasmanian Aboriginal people (the Black War, 1804–30) and nearly led to their extermination. The island achieved self-governing status in 1855–56. Associated with that development was the long-foreshadowed name change to Tasmania. Since then, “Van Diemen’s Land” has generally evoked the brutalities of convict transportation and ethnic conflict.
