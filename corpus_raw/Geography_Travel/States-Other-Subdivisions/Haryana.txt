Haryana,  state in north-central India. It is bounded on the northwest by the state of Punjab and the union territory of Chandigarh, on the north and northeast by the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, on the east by the state of Uttar Pradesh and the union territory of Delhi, and on the south and southwest by the state of Rajasthan. The city of Chandigarh, within the Chandigarh union territory, serves as the capital of not only that territory but also of the states of Haryana and Punjab.
Haryana was constituted on November 1, 1966, as a result of the partition of the former state of Punjab into two separate states—Punjabi-speaking Punjab and Hindi-speaking Haryana. Although the reorganization followed demands made by the Sikh community for a Punjabi suba (Punjabi-speaking province), it also substantially met the aspirations of people in the Hindi-speaking region of Punjab for a Vishal Haryana (Greater Haryana). The name Haryana, from Hari (the Hindu god Vishnu) and ayana (home), means “The Abode of God.” Area 17,070 square miles (44,212 square km). Pop. (2011) 25,353,081.
Haryana has two major physiographic regions: the flat alluvial plain covering most of the state and, in the northeast, a strip of the highly dissected Siwalik (Shiwalik) Range (including the narrow foothill zone). Remnants of the Aravalli Range, which stretches from southwestern Rajasthan to Delhi, are evident in parts of southern Haryana.
The alluvial plain lies at an elevation of 700 to 900 feet (210 to 270 metres) and is drained by only one perennial river, the Yamuna, located on the state’s eastern border. Many seasonal streams flowing from the Siwalik Range pass through the area, however. The most notable of these is the Ghaggar (near the state’s northern boundary), which once flowed far enough to join the Indus River, in what is now Pakistan.
The soils of Haryana are generally deep and fertile. There are some exceptions, however, including the eroded lands of the hilly northeast and the sandy areas of the southwest that fringe the Thar (Great Indian) Desert of Rajasthan. Most of the state’s land is arable, but much requires irrigation.
The climate of Haryana is hot in the summer and markedly cold in winter; maximum temperatures in May and June may exceed 110 °F (43 °C), and in January, the coldest month, low temperatures may drop below the freezing point.
Most of the state experiences arid to semiarid conditions; only in the northeast are conditions relatively humid. Precipitation averages about 18 inches (450 mm) annually, most falling between July and September. Although the state has a system of canal irrigation and tube wells, there are chronic drought-prone areas, particularly in the southern and southwestern regions. By contrast, the areas surrounding tributaries of the Yamuna and the Ghaggar are subject to occasional floods.
Little natural vegetation remains in Haryana. Eucalyptus trees are planted along the highways and in wastelands. Shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) trees grow along the roads and canals in the northern half of the state, while small, spiny kikar (Acacia arabica) trees and scrub are found in southern and southwestern Haryana.
Haryana is home to a variety of mammals. Larger species, including leopards, jackals, wild boars, and several types of deer, among others, are generally limited to the hilly regions of the northeast and the far south. Small mammals, such as bats, squirrels, mice, rats, and gerbils, are common in the plains. Ducks and teals of various sorts are found near the rivers. Pigeons and doves are common in the agricultural areas, as are small, colourful birds such as parakeets, buntings, sunbirds, bulbuls, and kingfishers. Several species of snakes are found in the state; among these are pythons, boas, and rat snakes, as well as poisonous kraits and vipers. Other reptiles, including various lizards, frogs, and tortoises, also inhabit Haryana.
Hindus constitute the great majority of Haryana’s population. Sikhs and Muslims each form a small but significant minority; there is also a tiny community of Christians. Most of the state’s Sikh population is located in the northeast and northwest, while Muslims are concentrated in the southeastern districts adjoining Delhi. Jats (members of the peasant caste) form the backbone of Haryana’s agricultural economy. They also are prominent in India’s armed forces.
Roughly three-fourths of Haryana’s population remained rural in the early 21st century; however, cities have continued to grow rapidly as commercial, industrial, and agricultural marketing centres. The state’s largest cities include Faridabad, Rohtak, Panipat, Hisar, Sonipat, and Karnal. With the exceptions of Rohtak, which is in central Haryana, and Hisar, which is in the northwest, most of the major urban centres lie in the eastern part of the state.
An agriculturally prosperous state, Haryana contributes a large amount of wheat and rice to the Central Pool (a national repository system of surplus food grain). In addition, the state produces significant quantities of cotton, rape and mustard seed, pearl millet, chickpeas, sugarcane, sorghum, corn (maize), and potatoes. Dairy cattle, buffaloes, and bullocks, which are used for plowing the land and as draft animals, are prominent in the northeastern region.
Haryana’s agricultural productivity is largely attributable to the so-called Green Revolution, an international movement launched in the 1960s to diminish world hunger. As a result of this movement, large-scale investments have been made in irrigation, fertilizers, and high-quality seeds. In the early 21st century, nearly two-fifths of the state’s workforce was employed in agriculture.
Haryana has made rapid strides in the development of agriculture-based manufacturing. Among the most important of such industries are cotton and sugar processing and the production of farm machinery. Haryana also manufactures chemicals as well as a great variety of consumer goods, most notably bicycles.
Haryana has long been well connected to surrounding states and to the rest of India. A number of major highways and railway lines—including the historic Grand Trunk Road and the main line of the Northern Railway—pass through the state to converge on Delhi. State-owned bus service operates between most of Haryana’s larger towns and cities. The state is served by a domestic airport in Chandigarh.
