Copeland,  borough (district), administrative county of Cumbria, historic county of Cumberland, northwestern England, in the southwestern part of the county along the Irish Sea coast. Copeland is a scenic mountain-and-lake region coextensive with the southwestern part of the Lake District in the Cumbrian Mountains. Scafell Pike, reaching an elevation of 3,210 feet (978 metres) above sea level, is England’s highest point and is located in the borough’s northeastern corner. There are also narrow coastal plains along the sea. Evidence of ancient Roman and Viking settlements is found throughout the borough.
Coal mined in the vicinity of the port of Whitehaven on the northwestern coast and iron ore mined near Egremont, 5 miles (8 km) southeast, and at Millom in the extreme south of the borough were used to develop the late 19th- and early 20th-century iron and steel industry at Workington, 8 miles (13 km) north of Whitehaven. Mining operations in the borough had ceased by the end of the 20th century.
Copeland’s contemporary varied economic base includes chemical works and silk weaving. Tourism has grown in importance. Whitehaven, the administrative centre, is also a fishing (cod and pilchard) and pleasure-craft port. The United Kingdom’s first nuclear power station, Calder Hall (opened 1956; decommissioned 2003), was 10 miles (16 km) south of Whitehaven. The adjacent Windscale nuclear power research station was shut down in 1981 and became a test case for dismantling a nuclear reactor. Area 283 square miles (732 square km). Pop. (2001) 69,318; (2011) 70,603.
