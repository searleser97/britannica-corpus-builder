Västra Götaland,  län (county), southwestern Sweden. It was created in 1998 by the amalgamation of the counties of Älvsborg, Göteborg och Bohus, and Skaraborg. The capital is Gothenburg, Sweden’s major port and second largest city.
Västra Götaland is bordered on the west by Norway, the Skagerrak, and the northern extremity of the Kattegat. It extends eastward to the western shore of Lake Vänern in the north and to the region between Lakes Vänern and Vättern in the south and encompasses the traditional landskap (provinces) of Bohuslän, Dalsland, and Västergötland. The varied terrain is hilly in the north, flat and low around Lake Vänern, and hilly again in the area west and southwest of Lake Vättern; elevations can exceed 1,000 feet (300 metres) near the lake’s western shore. The Göta River is the principal stream, draining southwestward from Lake Vänern to Gothenburg.
Soils are poor in the hilly areas, which remain largely forested, but soil deposits from the ancient Yoldia Sea, an extension of the Baltic Sea that is believed to have covered the region c. 7500 bce, have produced fertile areas. Wheat, rye, and oats are grown, and cattle raising and dairying are important. The county’s industry, centred on Gothenburg and Borås, includes quarrying, automobile assembly, and the manufacture of cement and matches. The falls and rapids of the Göta River are an important source of hydroelectricity, with a major station at Trollhättan. Numerous seaside resorts have made the coast a noted tourist area.
Falköping is an ancient city that contributed heavily to the development of Swedish culture and law. Skara, the pre-Christian religious centre, became the seat of Sweden’s first bishop in 1015 and was an important city in the Middle Ages. Other major cities include Lidköping, Skövde, and Vänersborg. Area 9,803 square miles (25,389 square km). Pop. (2010 est.) 1,580,297.
