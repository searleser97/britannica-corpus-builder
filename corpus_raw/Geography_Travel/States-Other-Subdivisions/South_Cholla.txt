South Chŏlla, also spelled South Jeolla, Korean in full Chŏllanam-do or Jeollanam-do,  do (province), extreme southwestern South Korea. It is bounded by North Chŏlla province (north), South Kyŏngsang province (east), Cheju Strait (south), and the Yellow Sea (west). Its coastline, including nearly 2,000 islands, of which three-fourths are uninhabited, is about 3,800 miles (6,100 km) long and represents one-third of the country’s total. Its marine products lead the country, particularly laver (seaweed) and oysters; its shrimp and mackerel are also prized. Kwangju—administratively designated a metropolitan city with province-level status—lies within the north-central part of the province. Muan County is the provincial capital.
Although the province is partly mountainous, its plains spread out along the Sŏmjin, Yŏngsan, and Tamjin rivers, making it the largest granary in the country. The plains receive abundant rainfall, exceeding 47 inches (1,200 mm) per year, and the province has the warmest weather on the Korean peninsula. The fertile land and the favourable climate make possible the production of large quantities of rice, wheat, barley, pulses (legumes), potatoes, and vegetables. Cotton, fruits, and bamboo are also grown. Cattle breeding is carried on in several hilly districts. Some mining of coal, gold, molybdenum, and other minerals takes place, and various industries have been developed. Mokp’o, on the west coast, is South Chŏlla’s major port. In 2009 prehistoric dolmens (stone tombs) in the central part of the province were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site together with dolmens in Kyŏnggi (Gyeonggi) and North Chŏlla provinces. Area 4,670 square miles (12,095 square km). Pop. (2015) 1,939,562.
