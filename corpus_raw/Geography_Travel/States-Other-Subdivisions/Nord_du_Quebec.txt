Nord-du-Québec, English North of Quebec, formerly Nouveau-Québec,  administrative region constituting the northern half of Quebec province, Canada. The name Nouveau-Québec (“New Quebec”) once was used synonymously with Ungava for that part of the Labrador-Ungava peninsula between Hudson Bay and the Labrador Sea, north of the Eastmain and Churchill (Hamilton) rivers, which was at the time a part of the Northwest Territories. In 1912, however, when the territory was annexed by Quebec, the term Nouveau-Québec generally replaced Ungava. Following the establishment of the provincial boundary between Quebec and Newfoundland (now Newfoundland and Labrador) in 1927, use of the name was limited to a territory in northern Quebec province, which in 1967 became a political subdivision of the province. During the 1980s the region’s name was changed to Nord-du-Québec. Governed from the city of Quebec, Nord-du-Québec is the largest but least populous of Quebec province’s regions. Pop. (2006) 39,817; (2011) 42,579.
