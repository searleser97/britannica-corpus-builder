Gabú,  region located in northeastern Guinea-Bissau. The Corubal River flows east-west through the southern half of Gabú, while the Colufe River flows east-west through the centre and empties into the Gêba River. The Gêba River in turn forms the northwestern border with the neighbouring region of Bafatá. The Gabú Plateau, with an elevation of some 300–500 feet (90–150 metres), extends north of the Corubal River to the border with Senegal. South of the Corubal River are the Boé Hills, which give rise in neighbouring Guinea to the Fouta Djallon and are rich in bauxite and iron-ore deposits. In the northern part of the region between the Gêba River and the border with Senegal, peanuts (groundnuts) are cultivated. The rest of the Gabú region has scattered grazing land (used for cattle, sheep, and goats) and subsistence farming (producing millet, corn [maize], sorghum, and rice). Cotton and sugarcane cultivation was implemented in the early 1980s. Gabú town, the regional capital, is connected by road to other parts of the country. The Fulani (Fulbe) constitute the main ethnic group, and the Malinke are the minority in the region. Pop. (2004 est.) 178,318.
