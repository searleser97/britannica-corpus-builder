Kershaw,  county, central South Carolina, U.S., northeast of Columbia. The Lynches River forms the northeastern border. The county is also drained by the Wateree River, which is impounded by Wateree Dam to form Wateree Lake, which in turn provides part of the western border. Most of the county lies in Fall Line hills, where pine forests cover the terrain. N.R. Goodale State Park is located there.
The area was inhabited by Siouan-speaking Indians prior to its settlement by Europeans. Kershaw county was formed in 1791 and named for Joseph Kershaw, an officer in the American Revolution. In 1780 Camden, which became the county seat, was seized by British troops and later burned. Camden was the birthplace of six Confederate army generals. Navigation on the Wateree contributed to the county’s economic development, as did cotton growing during the 19th and part of the 20th centuries. In the late 19th century Kershaw county began developing as a winter resort area.
Although the county is one of the state’s chief sources of eggs, agriculture is of minor importance to its economy. Kaolin, sericite, and sand are mined. Lumbering and the manufacture of synthetic fabrics and textile products are the basis of the economy. Area 726 square miles (1,881 square km). Pop. (2000) 52,649; (2010) 61,697.
