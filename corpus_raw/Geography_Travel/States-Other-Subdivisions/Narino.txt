Nariño,  departamento, southwestern Colombia, bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west and Ecuador on the south. Its population is concentrated principally in the volcanic Andean highlands above 5,000 feet (1,500 m). The densely settled Altiplano (high plateau) of Túquerres-Ipiales, which is situated on the Ecuadoran frontier, is separated by the Guáitara River from that of the departmental capital of Pasto. The economy is based almost exclusively on agriculture (wheat, barley, beans, and potatoes). Bananas are cultivated in the Pacific lowlands and are exported from the port of Tumaco, which handles large, oceangoing vessels. Sulfur deposits exist at the Cumbal volcano near Ipiales. The department is also a centre of lumbering; products of that industry include sawn wood, molding, and plywood. The Pan-American Highway runs north-south through the province. Area 12,845 square miles (33,268 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 1,578,877.
