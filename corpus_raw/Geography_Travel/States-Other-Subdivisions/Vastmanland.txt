Västmanland,  län (county) of central Sweden, extending north of Lake Mälar.

Dairying and market gardening are pursued on the plain, while mining and metalworking are centred on Fagersta, in Bergslagen district. The proximity of iron ore, with lesser deposits of copper, lead, and zinc, influenced the development of Västerås (q.v.), the capital, and Köping as engineering centres.
