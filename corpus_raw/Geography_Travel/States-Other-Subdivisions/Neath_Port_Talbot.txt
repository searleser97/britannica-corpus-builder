Neath Port Talbot, Welsh Castell-nedd Port Talbot,  county borough, southern Wales. Encompassing the Swansea Bay coast from the Kenfig Burrows in the south to the eastern outskirts of Swansea in the north, it extends inland across an area of wooded hills that form a sandstone plateau crossed by the broad valleys of the Rivers Afan, Neath, and Tawe.

Copper smelting and coal mining transformed the region during the Industrial Revolution. While many older industries have since disappeared, Neath Port Talbot today remains primarily industrial, with a range of manufacturing facilities—including steel, petrochemicals, and apparel—as well as automotive engineering.

Towns in the western part of the county borough, including Neath and Pontardawe, have attracted commercial and residential development and serve as commuting bases for neighbouring Swansea.
