Albacete,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Castile–La Mancha, southeast-central Spain. It occupies the southeastern end of the Meseta Central (plateau). Albacete is the driest interior province of the Iberian Peninsula, with about 14 inches (350 mm) average annual rainfall. The south is mountainous or hilly and is crossed by the Júcar and Segura rivers, which are the chief local sources of power and water for irrigation. The Sierra de Alcaraz rises in the west.
Albacete is a stock-raising province, but barley growing is increasing steadily, with a corresponding decline in livestock (though sheep raising remains important). Cheese is sent to all parts of Spain, and the province is known for its wine. Olives and apricots also are cultivated. Other products include saffron, esparto grass, and pine lumber.
Manufacturing, mainly of foodstuffs and leather products, is concentrated in the provincial capital, Albacete, and in the towns of Almansa, Hellín, and La Roda. A large portion of the province is accessible only by road, although there are good railway connections with Madrid and Alicante. Area 5,763 square miles (14,926 square km). Pop.
