Nagano,  landlocked largely mountainous ken (prefecture), central Honshu, Japan. The prefectural capital is Nagano city, in the northern part of the prefecture.
Most of the prefecture’s landscape is dominated by the three ranges—from northwest to southeast, Hida, Kiso, and Akaishi—of the Japanese Alps. The bulk of Nagano’s surface area is above 2,600 feet (790 metres) in elevation, and 15 peaks, mostly volcanic, rise higher than 9,800 feet (3,000 metres). Such large rivers as the Tenryū, Kiso, Chikuma, and Shinano have been harnessed for hydroelectricity.
Most of the population occupies small mountain basins (Suwa, Matsumoto, Ina, Hida, Zenkoji), in which sericulture and apple raising are specialties. Forestland is a rich resource. Projects for antipollution measures in forests and lakes began in 1974. Tourism is an important component of the regional economy, and large areas of the prefecture are within several national or quasi-national parks. The area around Nagano city is a popular skiing destination, and the city hosted the 1998 Olympic Winter Games. Area 5,245 square miles (13,585 square km). Pop. (2010) 2,152,449.
