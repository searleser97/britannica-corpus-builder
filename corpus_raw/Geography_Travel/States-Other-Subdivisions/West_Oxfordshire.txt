West Oxfordshire,  district, administrative and historic county of Oxfordshire, south-central England. It encompasses a mainly rural area in the western part of the county. The Cotswolds uplands extend into the northwest, and a clay valley predominates in the rest of the district and borders on the River Thames in the south and east. Witney is the administrative centre.
West Oxfordshire’s economy is supported by mixed farming (particularly sheep raising) and light industries that manufacture precision machinery and furniture. Long-established specialized industries are located in various old stone-built towns in the district. They include the manufacture of tweeds at Chipping Norton in the northwest, gloves at Charlbury and Woodstock in the centre, and blankets (since 1669) at Witney in the south. Chipping Norton, a prosperous wool town as early as the 13th century, has fine examples of 16th- and 17th-century stonemasons’ skills. Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim Palace, 1 mile (1.6 km) south of Woodstock, and is buried in the churchyard of the nearby village of Bladon. Area 276 square miles (715 square km). Pop. (2001) 95,640; (2011) 104,779.
