Blyth Valley,  former borough (district), unitary authority and historic county of Northumberland, England, on the North Sea coast northeast of Newcastle upon Tyne. The port of Blyth, the area’s largest town, was an early centre of the salt industry and later a coal port and shipbuilding centre. After the demise of these industries in the late 20th century, the port shifted to servicing Britain’s North Sea oil and gas industry and handling aluminum ore, imported coal, wood, and paper. Situated near the port is the Blyth offshore windfarm, a row of wind turbines that generate electricity for the national grid. Light industry developed in both Blyth and Cramlington. The town of Seaton Delaval had strong links with the landowning Delaval family, for whom the classical-style Seaton Delaval Hall, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh, was built (1719–30). Blyth Valley is mainly urban and suburban but contains some open countryside and woodland.
