Tocantins,  inland estado (state) of north-central Brazil. Tocantins is bounded by the states of Maranhão and Piauí to the northeast, Bahia to the east, Goiás to the south, Mato Grosso to the west, and Pará to the northwest. Tocantins was created from the northern  two-fifths of Goiás state in 1989. The capital is Palmas.
The state lies in the Brazilian Highlands at elevations between 330 and 1,300 feet (100 and 400 metres) above sea level. It is drained northward by the Araguaia and Tocantins rivers, which have cut deep valleys along their courses. The highlands of the state are covered with woodland savanna, and the river valleys support dense semideciduous forest. The northern tip of Tocantins is covered with tropical rainforest. Bananal Island, which lies in the Araguaia River in the southwest corner of the state, contains a major wildlife preserve and is the world’s largest known inland river island.
The climate is generally subtropical. There is only a small variation in average monthly temperature, and the average annual temperature is 75 °F (24 °C). The average annual rainfall is about 59 inches (1,500 mm), and precipitation falls mostly between October and March.
Tocantins is a developing frontier area, and its inhabitants historically have been mostly of Indian and mixed European-Indian ancestry. Cattle raising is the main economic activity, supplemented by the growing of rice, corn (maize), and soybeans. The state’s mineral resources include limestone, tin, and gypsum. The major towns are Palmas, Araguaína, Gurupi, and Pôrto Nacional. Araguaína and Gurupi are connected by a paved highway north to Belém and south to Brasília. Area 107,190 square miles (277,621 square km). Pop. (2010) 1,383,445.
