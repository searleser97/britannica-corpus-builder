Hyndburn,  borough (district), administrative and historic county of Lancashire, northwestern England. It lies between the denser urban areas of Blackburn and Burnley, with the moorlands of the Forest of Rossendale to the south and the agricultural Ribble valley to the north. Accrington is the boroughâ€™s largest town and administrative centre.
The borough takes its name from the River Hyndburn, along whose valley the towns developed. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal winds through the middle of the borough. The towns grew during the 19th century as the cotton textile industry developed, using first waterpower and later local coal. Among early industrialists was Robert Peel, grandfather of the prime minister, who lived near Oswaldtwistle; the inventor of the spinning jenny, James Hargreaves, lived at Stanhill. Engineering developed as a result of the textile industry and has remained important. Area 28 square miles (73 square km). Pop. (2001) 81,496; (2011) 80,734.
