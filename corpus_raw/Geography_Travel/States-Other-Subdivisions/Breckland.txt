Breckland,  district, administrative and historic county of Norfolk, England. It occupies much of west-central and south-central Norfolk. With poor sandy soils overlying chalk or clay, landscape features include heathland vegetation, small lakes, or meres, whose water level is variable, and plantations of trees.
The name Breckland was first applied in 1894 by the Norfolk naturalist W.G. Clarke to part of rural East Anglia, extending into northwestern Suffolk. It refers to medieval times when the region’s infertile soils were farmed by rotation, each section being ploughed perhaps 1 year in 10 and lying fallow in the intervals. This gave a series of “breaks,” or “brecks,” a kind of shifting agriculture. Eventually this spasmodic farming ceased, and the region became mainly shooting preserves and rabbit warrens, remaining so until shortly before World War II. Since then much of the region has been transformed. New agricultural techniques brought wide areas of Breckland into permanent and stable agricultural use, while the spread of forest plantations obliterated much of the earlier heathland.
Preserved are relics of an earlier era, for Breckland was once a major centre of flint production; some of the Neolithic flint mines have been reexcavated and preserved at Grime’s Graves, near Brandon, a town which long supported a flint-working, or flint-knapping, industry in the age of flintlock firearms. The district’s largest towns are Thetford and East Dereham. Area 504 square miles (1,305 square km). Pop. (2001) 121,418; (2011) 130,491.
