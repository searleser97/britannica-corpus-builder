Taunton Deane,  borough (district), administrative and historic county of Somerset, southwestern England. It lies in the Vale of Taunton Deane, which is sheltered by the Quantock, Black Down, and Brendon hills. The town of Taunton is the administrative centre.
The Anglo-Saxon king Ine founded Taunton town, building its first castle about 710. The first charter was granted in 904. Taunton’s second castle, built early in the 12th century, was three times besieged by Royalists during the English Civil Wars of the mid-17th century, when the town of Taunton supported the Parliamentarians. The castle was subsequently largely dismantled except for its gateway and the great hall where the harsh judge George Jeffreys’ infamous Bloody Assizes took place after the rebellion by James Scott, duke of Monmouth, in 1685.
The borough is predominantly agricultural. The important weekly produce and livestock market at Taunton dates from before the Norman Conquest (1066). Taunton also has some light industry and is the administrative centre of Somerset. Tourism is important to the economy. Area 173 square miles (462 square km). Pop. (2001) 102,299; (2011) 110,187.
