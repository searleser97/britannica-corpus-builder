Falkirk,  council area, east-central Scotland, encompassing a mostly low-lying area extending inland from the south bank of the River Forth estuary. It lies about midway between Glasgow and Edinburgh. Most of the council area lies within the historic county of Stirlingshire, but its eastern portion, around Bo’ness, belongs to the historic county of West Lothian. The council area has an urban core, but it includes rural agricultural areas in the north and south. Grangemouth, on the estuary, is the site of Scotland’s main container port and petrochemical complex.  Bo’ness, once an important seaport, is a small manufacturing town. Other industries in the council area include food processing, papermaking, and bookbinding. The industrial town of Falkirk is the administrative centre and the site of the Kelpies (2013), a pair of gigantic equine sculptures that loom over the Forth and Clyde Canal in Helix Park. Tourists also are drawn to the area to visit the Falkirk Wheel (2002), a unique rotating boat lift that connects the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal, providing a water link between Glasgow and Edinburgh. Area 115 square miles (297 square km). Pop. (2001) 145,191; (2011) 155,990.
