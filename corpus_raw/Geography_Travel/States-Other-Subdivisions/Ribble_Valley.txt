Ribble Valley,  borough (district), administrative county of Lancashire, northwestern England. It is situated along the county’s eastern border, extending into the western Pennine uplands. The southern part of the borough, including the lower River Ribble valley and the two largest towns, Clitheroe—the borough’s administrative centre—and Longridge, lies in the historic county of Lancashire. The remainder of the mostly rural borough, including the Ribble valley above Chatburn, the Pennine uplands to the north, and the Forest of Bowland region, belongs to the historic county of Yorkshire.
The River Ribble flows through a wide, cultivated lowland valley in the east and south between the Pennine uplands to the north and those on the southern edge of the borough. The predominantly grit moorland in the borough’s section of the Pennines surrounds relatively slablike limestone summits that are deeply dissected by upland dales. A former royal hunting ground in the northeastern part of the borough has been planted with conifers; except for this, the Forest of Bowland is a misnomer for the scenic region of hills and moors that occupies the northern part of the borough.
Pendle Hill, a prominent limestone hill, rises to 1,831 feet (558 metres) above the towns of Clitheroe and Whalley at the southern limits of the borough; there George Fox (1624–91) reported receiving the vision that moved him to form the Society of Friends (Quakers). The hill has also been historically associated with witchcraft as described in William Harrison Ainsworth’s The Lancashire Witches (1849). Clitheroe, the borough’s commercial centre, has a variety of light industries. Limestone is quarried nearby. Sheep and cattle graze the hillsides. Area 225 square miles (584 square km). Pop. (2001) 53,960; (2011) 57,132.
