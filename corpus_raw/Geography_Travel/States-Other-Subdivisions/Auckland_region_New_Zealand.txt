Auckland,  former region, northwestern North Island, New Zealand. It included the city of Auckland, its metropolitan area, and several outlying cities and towns. In November 2010 the greater Auckland region became a unitary authority that combined the governments of its constituent parts into one entity, the Auckland Council; these included the cities of Manukau, North Shore, and 11 others. The region is surrounded by several fine harbours, including Kaipara Harbour to the north and Manukau Harbour to the south.
