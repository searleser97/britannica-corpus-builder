Banten,  propinsi (or provinsi; province), western Java, Indonesia, bounded to the north by the Java Sea, to the northeast by the special capital district of Jakarta, to the east by the province of West Java (Jawa Barat), to the south by the Indian Ocean, and to the west by the Sunda Strait, across which lies the province of Lampung, in southern Sumatra. The capital of Banten is Serang, in the northwestern part of the province. Area 3,731 square miles (9,663 square km). Pop. (2010 prelim.) 10,632,166.
For a relatively small province, Banten has a quite varied topography. Lowlands in the northern and southwestern regions give way in the province’s midsection to rolling hills, which, in turn, are flanked by mountains in the west and southeast. Some peaks, such as Mount Karang, in the western region, rise well above 5,500 feet (1,700 metres). The province’s principal rivers include the Ujung, the Durian, and the Sadane, which empty into the Java Sea; the Liman, which flows into the Sunda Strait; and the Baliung, which flows into the Indian Ocean. Mangrove swamps are found in many coastal areas. Typical trees of the upland areas include teak, sal (Shorea species), eucalyptus, rhododendron, juniper, banyan, oak, ash, maple, and ironwood (or beefwood; Casuarinaceae species). The interior lowlands of the province are virtually devoid of woodlands, with the exception of Ujung Kulon National Park.
Designated a World Heritage site in 1991, Ujung Kulon National Park contains the last tracts of primary lowland rainforest on Java, mostly in its higher elevations; its low hills and plateaus, by contrast, are covered largely by secondary forests of palm and bamboo. The park is home to numerous rare animals, most notably the Javan rhinoceros and the Javan gibbon, which are endemic to the area. Other animals include langurs (leaf monkeys), muntjacs (barking deer), chevrotains (mouse deer), crocodiles, green turtles, green peafowl, and jungle fowl.
The Bantenese—a group of people who are culturally distinct from their Sundanese and Javanese neighbors but who speak a dialect of the Javanese language—constitute nearly one-half of the population of Banten. Sundanese people form more than one-fifth of the population. Other significant minorities include the Javanese and the Betawi, a creole community tracing its roots and language to the ethnically mixed milieu of colonial Batavia (now Jakarta). Chinese and Batak peoples each account for a tiny portion of the population. Nearly all of Banten’s residents practice Islam; Christianity is the religion of a small minority. The province’s population is concentrated in the north, particularly the northeastern region, which interfaces with the urban agglomeration of Jakarta. Banten’s largest cities are Tangerang and South Tangerang (Tangerang Selatan) in the northeast, followed by Serang and Cilegon in the northwest.
Manufacturing is the largest contributor to the province’s economy, with chemicals and chemical products, textiles and apparel, leatherwork, and rubber products dominating the industry. Trade and hospitality are also important, as are the transportation and communication sectors. Agriculture constitutes a relatively small segment of the economy. The principal food crop is rice, but cassava, sweet potatoes, corn (maize), peanuts (groundnuts), and soybeans are major secondary crops. Poultry and eggs are other notable products of the agricultural sector. Banten also produces significant quantities of fish from aquaculture and open-sea capture.
Banten’s road network is reasonably extensive and well-maintained in the northern region. In the south, by contrast, the overland infrastructure is less-developed. Railways operate in northern Banten, linking the region to the economic and political hub of Jakarta. The principal seaport is located at Ciwandan, in the northwest, on the Sunda Strait. Banten’s main airport is Tangerang’s large international facility, which also serves Jakarta.
For administrative purposes, the province is divided into kabupaten (regencies) and kota (cities). Each of these units is subdivided on several more levels, with the group of villages—known variously as a desa or a kelurahan—serving as the smallest administrative unit. The chief executive of Banten is the governor.
Significant written records concerning the area that now constitutes Banten stem only from the 16th century. Nevertheless, it is likely that Banten’s bay and historical port city (Bantam) on the northwestern coast had already become an international nexus by the 7th century ce, because of their strategic position on the ancient maritime trade route between China and India. From roughly the 7th through the 13th century, the region was under the influence of the Buddhist Srivijaya empire, centred in Palembang, southern Sumatra. After the disintegration of Srivijaya in the 13th century, the area was controlled by the Hindu elite of the kingdom of Pajajaran, which emerged in western Java in the mid-14th century and operated alongside the great Hindu empire of Majapahit, based in eastern Java. While Majapahit fell to the central-Javanese Muslim state of Demak in the late 15th or early 16th century, Muslim traders—dealing primarily in pepper—gradually displaced Pajajaran’s Hindu elite in Banten’s port.
Hasanuddin became the first sultan of Banten, and the population in the port area subsequently converted to Islam. It is from this historic sultanate that the province of Banten draws its name. The new sultanate extended its authority southward by sacking the remains of Pajajaran in 1579 and northwestward by subjugating parts of southern Sumatra by the turn of the 17th century. New farmers were recruited to plant pepper with each conquest, and Banten emerged as a leader in the Southeast Asian spice trade. As it expanded, the sultanate developed relations—some amicable, some hostile—with Portuguese, Dutch, British, and other European traders, all seeking to dominate the spice market. The Dutch East India Company ultimately won the monopoly and absorbed the sultanate of Banten into its operation through a treaty in 1684. After the dissolution of the company in 1799, coastal Banten came under Dutch colonial control, while the inland areas remained under the sultan. In 1813 the Dutch eliminated the sultanate and converted the entire territory into a residency.
Banten was a volatile region throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. One of the most significant uprisings against the Dutch took place in 1888, triggered by high taxes, religious conflict, and friction among the local elite. In 1926 the Indonesian Communist Party (Partai Komunis Indonesia; PKI) spearheaded a landmark rebellion there. Like the rest of the Dutch East Indies, Banten was occupied by the Japanese in 1942–45, during World War II. In 1950 Banten joined the Republic of Indonesia as part of the province of West Java (Jawa Barat). Many residents of the Banten region, however, viewed themselves as culturally and historically distinct from the Sundanese of West Java, and this consequently fueled a separatist movement throughout the second half of the 20th century. As a result of their efforts, Banten was declared a separate province in 2000.
