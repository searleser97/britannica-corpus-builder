In 1682 English Quaker William Penn arrived in Pennsylvania near the confluence of the Delaware River and Chester Creek at the Swedish settlement of Upland, which Penn renamed Chester when he made it the provincial capital. Built by Swedish settlers, the Morton Homestead in Prospect Park is one of the oldest buildings in Pennsylvania (c. 1650). Near Chadds Ford on Brandywine Creek, the British defeated the Americans at the Battle of the Brandywine in the U.S. War of Independence (Sept. 11, 1777). The county was formed in 1789 and named for either the Delaware Indians or the Delaware River. Media replaced Chester as the county seat in 1850. Villanova University was founded in Villanova in 1842, and Swarthmore College was established by Quakers in Swarthmore in 1864.
