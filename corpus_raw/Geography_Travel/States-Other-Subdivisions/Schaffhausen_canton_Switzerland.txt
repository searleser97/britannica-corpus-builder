Schaffhausen,  (German), French Schaffhouse,  most northerly canton of Switzerland. It lies north of the Rhine River and west of Lake Constance (Bodensee) and has an area of 115 square miles (298 square km), of which about 90 percent is classed as productive. It is virtually surrounded on the north, east, and west by Germany, portions of which divide the canton into three detached parts: a large region including the capital city of Schaffhausen (q.v.), the small isolated district of Rüdlingen-Buchberg to the southwest, and an area extending northward from Stein am Rhein. The canton contains the small German enclave of Büsingen. The dominant relief feature is the plateau of Randen (reaching 2,992 feet [912 m] at the summit, Hoher Randen), which slopes gently southward to the Rhine River and is intersected by short, narrow valleys such as the Klettgau. On the Rhine just below Schaffhausen is the celebrated Rhine Falls.
Historically, the canton represents acquisitions made at various times by the city of Schaffhausen, which was admitted to the Swiss Confederation in 1501. The cantonal constitution dates from 1876.
The major industries include the production of machinery and metal goods, watches, food and beverages, and chemicals. Hydroelectricity produced at Rheinau supplies power for the chemical industry at Rheinfelden and engineering works at Schaffhausen. Vine cultivation is the predominant agricultural activity, and forestry is significant. The majority of the population is German speaking and Protestant. Pop. (2007 est.) 73,866.
