Oio,  region located in north-central Guinea-Bissau. It was created from the former concelhos (municipalities) of Farim, Bissorã, and Mansôa in the mid-1970s. Oio’s border with the Quinará region, its neighbour to the south, is formed by the Gêba River, which flows east-west. The Mansôa River flows east-west through the southern half of the region, and the Farim River (called the Cacheu River in its lower course) flows east-west through the region’s northern half; all three rivers empty into the Atlantic Ocean. Peanuts (groundnuts) are intensively cultivated around Farim town and are also grown just south of the Farim River and north of the river to the border with Senegal. There are forests around Bissorã town, the region’s capital. Scattered grazing land is used for raising cattle, sheep, and goats. Subsistence agriculture produces millet, corn (maize), sorghum, and rice. Cotton cultivation was implemented in certain parts of the region in the early 1980s. Phosphates are found near Farim and Binta towns. Roads link Farim town north to the border with Senegal, west to Bigene, and south to Mansabá. In southern Oio region a road connects Mansôa town to Bissau, the national capital. The Balante are the dominant ethnic group in the region. Pop. (2004 est.) 179,048.
