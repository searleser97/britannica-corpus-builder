Rotuma Island,  island dependency of Fiji, South Pacific Ocean, 400 miles (640 km) north-northwest of Suva. Rotuma is a volcanic island surrounded by eight islets. Sighted in 1791 by the British naval ship Pandora during its search for the HMS Bounty mutineers, the main island was formerly called Grenville. The group was annexed by Great Britain in 1881 and attached administratively to Fiji, then a British possession. The village of Ahau is the site of the government administrative centre as well as a post office, bank, and health centre. Copra, root vegetables, and woven mats are exported through the small ports of Motusa in the west and Oinafa in the northeast. An airstrip is located on the northern coast between Oinafa and Ahau. The Rotuman population is of primarily Polynesian origin. During the latter half of the 20th century many Rotumans migrated to other areas of Fiji. Area 18 square miles (47 square km). Pop. (2007 prelim.) 2,095.
