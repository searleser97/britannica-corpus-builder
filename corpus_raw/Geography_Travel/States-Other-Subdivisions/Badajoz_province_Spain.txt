Badajoz,  provincia (province) in the Extremadura comunidad autónoma (autonomous community), extreme western Spain. Badajoz is bordered by Portugal to the west. Along with the province of Cáceres, Badajoz makes up the autonomous and historic region of Extremadura. The climate is characterized by long, hot, dry summers. The terrain is almost entirely flat but rises in the south and southwest near the Sierra Morena, and in the northeast it joins the foothills of the mountains of Toledo province. It is crossed from east to west by the Guadiana River, the most important tributary of which is the Zújar. Typifying the wider central plain is the Barros Plain, the largest cereal-, wine-, and oil-producing region of Extremadura; its main centre is Almendralejo. Other regions in the province produce wool, and livestock raising is important. Industry, primarily agricultural processing (tomatoes), is concentrated in Badajoz city, Mérida, Almendralejo, and Villanueva de la Serena. Most services and administrative offices are concentrated in Badajoz (the provincial capital) and Mérida (the regional capital). The province’s extensive forests are only minimally exploited.
In 1952 the Spanish government promoted a project known as the Plan Badajoz, which raised the standard of living, productivity, and agriculture and intensified development and industrialization in the area. Irrigation was undertaken, using the waters of the Guadiana and Zújar, controlled by six dams. The plan provided for new agriculturally based industries, chiefly the production of flour, cotton, and olive oil, and for vegetable preserving. Electrification was also increased, and communications were improved. The National Institute of Colonization created new towns and resettled thousands of people to whom land grants were made. In spite of these undertakings, emigration to other parts of Spain continued into the early 21st century. Area 8,404 square miles (21,766 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 678,459.
