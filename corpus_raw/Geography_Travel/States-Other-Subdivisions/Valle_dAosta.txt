Valle d’Aosta,  region, northwestern Italy, containing the upper basin of the Dora Baltea River, from its source near Mount Blanc to just above Ivrea. The region is enclosed on the north, west, and south by the Alps. Originally the territory of the Salassi, a Celtic tribe, the valley was annexed by the Romans; Aosta, the capital, was founded in 24 bc. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Valle d’Aosta formed part of the Burgundian and Frankish kingdoms, passing through many hands until it was acquired in the 11th century by the House of Savoy (the future royal house of Italy). Aosta province was formed from part of Torino province in 1927, and the autonomous region of Valle d’Aosta was created in 1945 in recognition of the special French linguistic and cultural orientation of the area. At that time, the southern portion was returned to Torino province.
The busy highway from the Po Valley to the Great and Little St. Bernard passes runs through the region, which is important for dairy products and tourism and has hydroelectric resources. There is some industry in the area. A nationalist group supporting increased use of French in the region gained political and electoral strength throughout the 1970s. Area 1,259 square miles (3,262 square km). Pop. (2006 est.) 123,978.
