Ciudad Real,  provincia (province), southwestern Castile–La Mancha comunidad autónoma (autonomous community), south-central Spain, one of five provinces formed from the ancient region of New Castile. In the east and centre, high plains form part of the flat, dry windmill region known as La Mancha, characterized in Miguel de Cervantes’s novel Don Quixote. The remainder of the province is mountainous, crossed by the Morena Mountains to the south and the Toledo Mountains to the northwest. The Guadiana river system drains the region.
Cereals (barley and wheat), grapes, olives, vegetables, and wine (especially that of Valdepeñas) are the province’s main products. Sheep pasturing is carried on in La Mancha. Mercury is mined at Almadén and coal at Puertollano, near which a modern industrial chemical complex has been built (it includes an inland oil refinery). Industrial development, however, apart from that based on agriculture, is slight and is concentrated in the provincial capital of Ciudad Real, Valdepeñas, and in Manzanares. Other principal towns are Puertollano, Tomelloso, and Alcázar de San Juan. Area 7,650 square miles (19,813 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 510,122.
