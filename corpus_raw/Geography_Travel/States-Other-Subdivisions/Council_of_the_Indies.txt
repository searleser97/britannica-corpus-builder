Council of the Indies, Spanish Consejo De Indias,  supreme governing body of Spain’s colonies in America (1524–1834). Composed of between 6 and 10 councillors appointed by the king, the council prepared and issued all legislation governing the colonies in the king’s name, approved all important acts and expenditures by colonial officials, and acted as a court of last resort in civil suits appealed from colonial courts. It lost much of its importance in the 18th century.
