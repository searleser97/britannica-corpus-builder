Fukuoka,  ken (prefecture), northern Kyushu, Japan. Fukuoka faces the Tsushima Strait (Eastern Channel) to the west, the Inland Sea to the northwest, the Shimonoseki Strait to the north, and the Ariake Sea to the south. Rivers draining seaward have built up extensive plains. The western coast of Fukuoka is heavily indented, and Fukuoka city, the prefectural capital, is situated on Hakata Bay, one of those indentations.
Agriculture is carried out in the south, but Fukuoka is important mainly for its industry, which is concentrated in the north. Coal mining, once significant, has ceased. In 1963 the five cities of Moji, Kokura, Tobata, Yahata, and Wakamatsu were amalgamated to form Kita-Kyūshū, the largest city and industrial complex in Kyushu. Two tunnels run under the Shimonoseki Strait, connecting the city with Honshu. In addition, Kanmon Bridge also spans the strait. Area 1,919 square miles (4,971 square km). Pop. (2010) 5,071,968.
