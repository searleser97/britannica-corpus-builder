Orchha,  former Rajput princely state of central India, founded in about 1500. In the early 17th century it was systematically devastated by the forces of the Mughal emperor Shah JahƒÅn following the rebellion of the Bundala chief Jujhar Singh.
Tehri (later Tikamgarh) was chosen as the capital in 1783. Orchha was part of the Central Indian Agency under British rule. In 1948, following the achievement of Indian independence, it was merged into Vindhya Pradesh (later Madhya Pradesh) as the district of Tikamgarh.
