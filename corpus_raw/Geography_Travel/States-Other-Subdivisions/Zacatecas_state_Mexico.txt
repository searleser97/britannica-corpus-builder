Zacatecas,  estado (state), north-central Mexico. It is bordered by the states of Coahuila to the north, San Luis Potosí to the east, Jalisco and Aguascalientes to the south, and Nayarit and Durango to the west. Its capital is the city of Zacatecas.
The state’s territory lies largely within the arid Mexican Plateau, with the Sierra Madre Occidental traversing the southwestern region and the Sierra Madre Oriental reaching the northeastern corner. The average elevation on the plateau is about 7,700 feet (2,350 metres); the climate is dry and warm in the valleys and temperate in the mountains. The state’s major rivers are the Atengo, Jerez, Juchipila, San Andrés, Tlaltenango, and Valparaíso. Precipitation averages about 20 inches (500 mm) per year.
The state’s mineral wealth, consisting primarily of silver, was discovered soon after the Spanish conquest. From the mid-16th century the mines there were among the largest sources of wealth in the Spanish colonies, comparable only to Upper Peru’s Cerro Rico (now in Potosí, Bolivia). Agriculture (cereals, alfalfa, sugarcane, and maguey, from which the alcoholic beverage pulque is made) is also an important occupation, but the low rainfall limits crop yields, and only a small proportion of the state’s farmland is irrigated. Cattle are raised, and meat processing is important. Manufactures are limited chiefly to mineral products, sugar refining, beverages (notably rum, pulque, and mescal), and woolen and cotton textiles.
State government is headed by a governor, who is elected to a single six-year term. Members of the unicameral State Legislature are elected to three-year terms. Like other Mexican states, Zacatecas is divided into local governmental units called municipios (municipalities). In the late 20th century Zacatecas became part of Mexico’s so-called “hollow core” as many of its residents moved elsewhere, seeking work in the United States, along the U.S.-Mexican border, or in the Federal District. The rail, highway, and air routes traversing the state link Zacatecas city with El Paso (Texas) and Mexico City. Area 28,283 square miles (73,252 square km). Pop. (2010) 1,490,668.
