Suffolk Coastal,  district, administrative and historic county of Suffolk, eastern England. It occupies an area that borders the North Sea to the east for about 32 miles (51 km). Woodbridge is the district seat.
Suffolk Coastal is a low-lying district containing rolling hills in the interior north and west. The area bordering the sea has sand and gravel beaches, crumbling cliffs, and estuaries frequented by rare bird species. Directly inland the landscape is forested, especially in the south between the towns (parishes) of Woodbridge and Aldeburgh. The north coastal parishes of Walberswick, Dunwich, and Aldeburgh were prosperous local ports several hundred years ago. Erosion of the cliffs by waves, however, has washed away much of those towns. Artists, bird-watchers, and sailing enthusiasts visit the area, and music lovers attend the annual (since 1948) Aldeburgh Festival, founded by the locally born composer Benjamin Britten.
Felixstowe, Suffolk Coastal’s largest town, lies at the district’s southern tip. It developed as a seaside resort in the 19th century. By the late 20th century its amusement park and beaches remained popular, but it had also become one of Great Britain’s most important container ports. Cereals, sugar beets, cattle, and pigs are raised inland. The Sizewell nuclear power station is located in the district. Area 344 square miles (892 square km). Pop. (2001) 115,141; (2011) 124,298.
