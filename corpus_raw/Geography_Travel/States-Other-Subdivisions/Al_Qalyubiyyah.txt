The muḥāfaẓah’s mineral resources are phosphates and basalt, at Abū Zaʿbal, on the eastern fringe of the cultivated zone. There is also a chemicals plant, producing fertilizer, sulfuric acid, oleum, and aerosols. The principal towns are Banhā, capital of the muḥāfaẓah, and Qalyūb. At Musṭurud there is an oil refinery, located on the Suez-Mediterranean oil pipeline. Area 386 square miles (1,001 square km). Pop. (2006) 4,237,003.
