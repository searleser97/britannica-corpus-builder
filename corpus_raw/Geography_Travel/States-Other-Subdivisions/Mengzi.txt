Mengzi, Wade-Giles romanization Meng-tze,  county, southern Yunnan sheng (province), China. The county seat is in Wenlan town.
In the 19th century, Mengzi was a trading centre for commerce between the interior of Yunnan and the Hanoi-Haiphong area of Vietnam. Communications were inconvenient: goods were shipped to Hekou on the Vietnamese border by junk, transferred by small craft to Manhao, and then taken 37 miles (60 km) by pack animal to Mengzi. Despite these difficulties, Mengzi was an important port of entry into both Yunnan and western Guizhou provinces, and in 1889 it was opened to foreign trade as a treaty port. Most of this foreign trade was in tin and opium.
The importance of Mengzi was ended by the construction of the French railway from Haiphong to Kunming (the Yunnan provincial capital) in 1906–10. This railway bypassed Mengzi, but in 1915 a branch line was built via the town to the Gejiu tin mines. Apart from a brief respite during the early days of World War II, the town of Mengzi has, nevertheless, steadily declined in importance ever since. Gejiu became a county in 1913, and a city in 1951. With the improvement of communications and transportation between cities of Gejiu and Kaiyuan and the other counties nearby, plus the development of trade between southwestern China and the countries of Southeast Asia, Mengzi’s ties have increasingly strengthened with Gejiu and Kaiyuan. The whole area has become a border economic centre. In addition to tin, the county’s natural resources include coal, manganese, lead, zinc, and antimony. The Mengzi region is well-known for a dish called guoqiao mixian, made with long rice-flour noodles. Pop. (2005 est.) 320,000.
