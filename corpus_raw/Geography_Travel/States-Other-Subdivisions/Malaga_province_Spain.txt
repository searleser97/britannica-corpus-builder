Málaga,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Andalusia, southern Spain, on the Mediterranean coast. Its northern half lies on the Andalusian plain, while its southern half is mountainous and rises steeply from the coast, along which there is a narrow strip of lowland. The Alhama Mountains separate Málaga from Granada to the east, and not far from the Cádiz boundary, to the west, the ridges of Ronda, Mijas, Tolox, and Bermeja converge to form a summit, Mount Torrecilla (6,296 feet [1,919 metres]). The principal rivers in Málaga are the Guadalhorce and the Guadiaro.
The province is largely agricultural; fruits, including grapes, and vegetables are grown along the coastal lowlands and in the rich interior valleys. The warm, sunny climate of the coast (part of the Costa del Sol) has made the area popular with tourists, especially around Torremolinos, Fuengirola, Marbella, and Málaga city, the provincial capital. The service industry dominates the economy, but the manufacture of textiles, liquors, electronics, and leather products is substantial. Other attractions include the Menga, Viera, Nerja, and El Romeral caves, with their prehistoric paintings and relics, and a national hunting region in the Serranía de Ronda, north of Marbella. Besides Málaga, the most important cities in the province are Ronda and Antequera. Area 2,822 square miles (7,308 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 1,517,523.
