Lara,  estado (state), northwestern Venezuela. It was named for independence hero Gen. Juan Jacinto Lara. Bordered on the north by Falcón, east by Yaracuy, south by Portuguesa and Trujillo, and west by Zulia, the state lies in the Segovia Highlands, a hilly region plagued by recurring droughts.

Cattle raising is also an important component of the local economy, as are winemaking and liquor distilling. Lara accounts for almost all of Venezuela’s sisal; its manufacture into bags, sacks, and cordage is another of the state’s important industries. Lara is traversed by highways that link Barquisimeto, the state capital, with the major urban centres to the northeast. Area 7,645 square miles (19,800 square km). Pop.
