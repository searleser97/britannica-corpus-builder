Baffin,  northernmost and easternmost region of Nunavut territory, Canada. In 1967 it was created as Baffin region, Northwest Territories, from most of what was formerly Franklin district, and it took on its present borders with the creation of Nunavut in April 1999. The largest of Nunavutâ€™s three regions, Baffin extends southward from the northern tip of Ellesmere Island. It encompasses all of Ellesmere, Baffin, Devon, Bathurst, and the Belcher islands, as well as Melville Peninsula (on the mainland). It also includes the northern portions of Prince of Wales and Somerset islands and the eastern part of Melville Island. The landscape, which mostly consists of Arctic tundra and icecap, supports a small, largely Inuit population that is engaged in fur trapping, fishing, and mining. Major settlements include the Baffin Island towns of Iqaluit (the regional headquarters and territorial capital), Pangnirtung (Panniqtuuq), Pond Inlet (Mittimatalik), and Cape Dorset (Kingnait), as well as Igloolik (Iglulik) on Melville Peninsula. Pop. (2006) 15,765; (2011) 16,939.
