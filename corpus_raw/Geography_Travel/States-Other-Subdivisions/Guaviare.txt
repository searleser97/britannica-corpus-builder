Guaviare,  departamento, southeastern Colombia. Guaviare lies in an area of tropical, semideciduous rainforest merging into the Llanos (grassland plains) on the north. It is bounded on the north by the Guaviare River; on the east by the highlands of the mesas (tablelands) Cubiyú and Carurú; on the south by the departamentos of Vaupés and Caquetá; and on the west and north by Meta departamento. Guaviare’s area incorporated the majority of Vaupés’ inhabitants when it was formed as a comisaría (“commissariat”) in 1977; it became a departamento in 1991.
Guaviare has one principal settlement, the frontier capital San José del Guaviare, located on the right bank of the Guaviare River in the north. Land transportation is provided by an unimproved road from Bogotá, to the northwest, through Villavicencio, capital of Meta departamento, to San José del Guaviare. Difficult river transport on the Guayabero and Guaviare rivers exists for light-cargo transport. Air service, however, is the primary form of access to San José del Guaviare from northern and western Colombia. Many of the area’s inhabitants are indigenous Indians. Area 16,342 square miles (42,327 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 98,189.
