West Sumatra, Indonesian Sumatera Barat,  propinsi (or provinsi; province), west-central Sumatra, Indonesia, fronting the Indian Ocean to the west and bounded by the provinces of North Sumatra (Sumatera Utara) to the north, Riau to the northeast, Jambi to the southeast, and Bengkulu to the south. It includes the islands of Siberut, Sipura, North Pagai (Pagai Utara), and South Pagai (Pagai Selatan), all in the Mentawai group, located in the Indian Ocean across the Mentawai Strait from central Sumatra. The capital, Padang, lies at the centre of the province’s mainland coastline. Area 16,221 square miles (42,013 square km). Pop. (2010) 4,846,909.
The Barisan Mountains run northwest-southeast; they are flanked by lowlands on the southern half and by swamps on the northern half of the western coast. On the eastern side of the mountains, the Padang Highlands stretch almost to the eastern boundary of the province. The mountain system itself consists of several parallel ridges surmounted by numerous active and extinct volcanoes, including Mounts Talang (8,520 feet [2,597 metres]), Marapi (9,485 feet [2,891 metres]), and Singgalang (9,439 feet [2,877 metres]). Freshwater swamp forests are found at many places along the coast. The lowland rainforests of pine, teak, and mahogany extend to the hilly upland region.
Minangkabau people constitute the great majority of the population. Notable minorities include  Batak and Javanese peoples as well as smaller numbers of South Asians and Chinese. Islam is the dominant religion.
The mainstay of the economy is agriculture, with rice, corn (maize), cassava, tea, coffee, rubber, pepper, tobacco, coconuts, and soybeans among the principal products. Various manufacturing establishments yield processed foods and beverages, cement, textiles, rubber products, chemicals, and transport equipment. Roads run the length of the province, and railway lines cross the central part.
Western Sumatra, long inhabited by Minangkabau peoples, started to be settled by immigrants from India in the 2nd century ce. The region subsequently became part of the Buddhist Srivijaya empire, which flourished in southern Sumatra from the 7th to the 13th century. With the decline of Srivijaya, the Hindu-Malay kingdom of Minangkabau rose to power in the region, and in the 16th century the Minangkabau king converted to Islam. Shortly thereafter, in 1596, the Dutch entered the area and began to establish a firm foothold in western Sumatra. In the early 19th century, control of the island passed temporarily to the British. The Dutch managed to reestablish themselves in the region after intervening on behalf of the Minangkabau royal family during the civil war known as the Padri War (1821–37). Dutch rule was then imposed throughout the domain of the Minangkabau (roughly coextensive with what is now West Sumatra province).
The Japanese occupied Sumatra (1942–45) during World War II. After the war, Indonesian nationalists declared the formation of the Republic of Indonesia; following a period of intense anticolonial struggle, West Sumatra was incorporated into the Republic of Indonesia in 1950, as part of the province of Central Sumatra. In 1957 Central Sumatra was split into the provinces of Riau, Jambi, and West Sumatra. Early the following year, West Sumatra was a seat of rebellion against the Sukarno government, and the Revolutionary Government of the Indonesian Republic was formed in the province, with its headquarters at Bukittinggi. The rebellion was crushed by Indonesian forces in mid-1958 after aerial attacks on Padang and Bukittinggi.
