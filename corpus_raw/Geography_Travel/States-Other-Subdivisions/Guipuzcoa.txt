Guipúzcoa,  province, in the autonomous Basque Country, northern Spain. The smallest of the Spanish provinces, it is situated on the Bay of Biscay between Vizcaya (Biscay) province and the French frontier. With Álava and Vizcaya, it became one of the three component provinces of the autonomous region of the Basque Country in 1980. The name was used as a geographical entity from the end of the 10th century, and as a county Guipúzcoa was unified with Castile in 1200. Its chief towns were founded or resettled during the 13th and 14th centuries. Its central position among the three Basque Country provinces has enabled it to preserve its language and ancient traditions more fully than either of the others.
To the east and west the province’s boundaries are clearly defined by the valleys of the Bidasoa (French Bidassoa) and Deva rivers, and it is also traversed by the valleys of the rapid and unnavigable Urumea, Oria, and Urola rivers. The province’s mountainous and partly forested interior accounts for its primary economic activity—lumbering. Everywhere there is careful and intensive cropping of the lower valley slopes, and much of the land is under pasture. Only a small portion of the total area is cropped, however, chiefly under corn (maize), beans, and numerous small apple orchards. A stock-raising economy dominates, especially of Swiss stall-fed dairy cattle. Iron is mined in the Deva Valley and has fostered light metallurgical industries throughout the province. Paper and textiles are also manufactured. Tourism, based on beach resorts near the provincial capital, San Sebastián, is also significant economically. Towns of importance include the manufacturing centres of Vergara, Eibar, and Tolosa; the nation’s chief customs town, Irún; and Puerto de Pasajes, a busy port. Area 771 square miles (1,997 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) 701,056.
