Hertsmere,  borough (district), administrative county of Hertfordshire, England. Most of the borough belongs to the historic county of Hertfordshire, but the eastern part of the borough, including Potters Bar, lies in the historic county of Middlesex. The district headquarters are at Borehamwood.
Hertsmere lies just north of Greater London, between Watford on the west and Hatfield on the east. It thus covers a part of the periphery of contemporary London, with a considerable area of open space surviving in the form of farmland, parks, playing fields, and golf courses but with tentacles of suburban development encroaching upon it from the south. Green Belt legislation has helped to restrict this encroachment and preserve the remaining open space. Area 39 square miles (101 square km). Pop. (2001) 94,450; (2011) 100,031.
