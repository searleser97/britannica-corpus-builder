Janūb Sīnāʾ, (Arabic: “Southern Sinai”) formerly Sīnāʾ al-Janūbiyyah,  muḥāfaẓah (governorate), southern part of Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. The governorate was created out of Sīnāʾ muḥāfaẓah in late 1978, after the first stages of the Israeli withdrawal from the peninsula were initiated. The northern boundary of the governorate roughly follows the old pilgrim track (Darb al-Ḥājj) from Suez city to Elat in Israel.
The topography of the governorate is rugged, consisting in the south of granite and sandstone mountains cut by steep-walled wadis (seasonal watercourses). The highest peak is the historic Mount Katrīnah (Catherine), 8,668 feet (2,642 metres). Scattered over the governorate is a modest Bedouin population that lives mainly by growing dates, barley, and some fruits and by raising livestock (camels, goats, donkeys, and sheep). The city of Al-Ṭūr, capital of the governorate, is their principal settlement.
Fishing is of some importance along the Gulf of Suez, with the main catching and storage centre at Al-Ṭūr. The governorate’s main resource is mineral wealth, of which petroleum is the most important. First discovered at Mount Tanakah in 1910, new oil fields have multiplied, especially since the return of the western Sinai to Egypt. The Gulf of Suez fields are the richest oil-producing deposits in Egypt. Al-Ṭūr is the centre for the Sinai oil industry.
Tourism has become an economically important activity in the governorate since the late 1970s. St. Catherine’s, built by the Byzantine emperor Justinian (527–565) on the traditional site of the burning bush encountered by Moses near Mount Sinai, remains an active Greek Orthodox monastic community and is the seat of an autocephalous archbishop. It is also a pilgrimage and tourist site. The governorate contains several other Christian monastic sites of historical interest. Area 12,796 square miles (33,140 square km). Pop. (2006) 149,335.
