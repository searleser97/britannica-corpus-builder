Chautauqua,  county, extreme southwestern New York state, U.S., bordered by Lake Erie to the north and Pennsylvania to the west and south. A band of lowlands along Lake Erie rises to rolling hills that surround Chautauqua Lake in the interior. The county is drained by French, Cassadaga, and Conewango creeks. The major forest types are sugar maple, beech, and oak, with stands of elm and red maple in lowland regions. Recreational areas include Lake Erie and Long Point state parks.
Indians native to the region when Dutch and English traders arrived were Iroquoian-speaking Erie. The State University of New York College at Fredonia was founded in 1826. Other communities are Jamestown, Dunkirk, and Mayville, which is the county seat. Located on Chautauqua Lake, the resort town of Chautauqua contains the Chautauqua Institution (founded 1874), a centre for adult education that inspired hundreds of similar lyceums nationwide as part of the Chautauqua movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
The county was formed in 1808, its name derived from a Seneca Indian word meaning “where the fish was taken out.” The main economic activities are agriculture (fruit, hay, and cattle) and manufacturing (furniture, machinery, and metal products). Area 1,062 square miles (2,751 square km). Pop. (2000) 139,750; (2010) 134,905.
