Mole Valley,  district, administrative and historic county of Surrey, southeastern England. It occupies the south-central portion of Surrey, with the town of Dorking as its administrative and service centre.
The River Mole, from which the district takes its name, flows northward across it to join the Thames at Hampton Court, on the southwestern edge of Greater London. The river cuts through a line of chalk hills (the North Downs) in a steep-sided valley that is followed by road and rail routes. South of the Downs is a narrow lowland and then a second line of sandstone heights. Dorking stands at the point where the River Mole enters its narrow valley section from the south.
From the northern end of the district, near Leatherhead, the built-up area is virtually continuous to central London, but the North Downs and other parts of the district fall within London’s Greenbelt or are designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, thereby enjoying protection from residential development. A considerable number of the district’s residents are commuters to the Greater London region. Area 100 square miles (259 square km). Pop. (2001) 80,287; (2011) 85,375.
