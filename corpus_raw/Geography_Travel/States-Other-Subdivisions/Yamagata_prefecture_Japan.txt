Yamagata,  prefecture (ken), northern Honshu, Japan, on the Sea of Japan (East Sea). Much of the prefecture is mountainous. Bandai-Asahi National Park, stretching from north to south, includes the Dewa Sangan (Three Mountains of Dewa [Gassan, Yudono-san, Haguro-san]), which are sacred to the Shugen-dō sect of Buddhism; the granite mountains associated with Asahi-dake (6,135 ft [1,870 m]); and Iide-san (6,906 ft). In the northwest, Chōkai Quasi-national Park is crowned by Chōkai-zan, which rises to 7,316 ft on the border with Akita Prefecture. The extinct volcano of Zaō-san (6,040 ft) is the central feature of Zaō Quasi-national Park in the southeast.
The prefecture is drained by the Mogami River. Its valley is followed by a main highway and railway and contains the major interior towns. The short coastal plain is largely composed of the Mogami River delta.
Yamagata’s agriculture is based on rice production, sericulture, and fruit orchards. Forestry and fishing are locally important, and deposits of petroleum, zinc, natural gas, and feldspar are worked. Industries produce electrical machinery, precision instruments, and paper.
