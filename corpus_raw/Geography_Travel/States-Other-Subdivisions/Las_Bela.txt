Las Bela, also spelled Lasbela,  district of Kalāt division, Balochistān province, Pakistan. A former princely state, it has an area of 7,048 sq mi (18,254 sq km) and is bounded north by Khuzdār district, east by the Kīrthar Range (separating it from Sind), south by the Arabian Sea, and west by the Hāla Range. An agriculturally underdeveloped zone with untapped water resources, it is mountainous in the east and has a central alluvial lowland drained by the Porāli and Kūd rivers; in the west is a narrow coastal strip dotted with mangrove swamps.
Cultivation depends upon flood irrigation, with jowār (sorghum) and oilseeds being the chief crops. Sheep, camels, and goats are bred extensively, and fishing is important along the coast. Sonmiāni is the principal seaport.
Bela (ancient Armabel, Armel), the district headquarters until it was replaced by Uthal, and site of the jām’s (chief’s) residence, lies just east of the Porāli at the apex of the Las Bela Plain; it is linked by roads with Karāchi and with Quetta via Kalāt and Mastung. Rugs, embroidery, and crochet work are local handicrafts. The caves at Gondrāni (north of Bela), hewn out of solid rock, are probably of Buddhist origin.
Las Bela is strategically located on the Makrān coastal trade route between Sind and Iran (Persia). The army of Alexander the Great retreated to Persia through the southern part in 325 bc, and the Arab general Muḥammad ibn al-Qāsim followed the same path c. ad 711. Stone ruins at Gondakeha on the Kūd, 10 mi (16 km) northwest of Bela, indicate ancient Arab (possibly Ḥimyaritic) occupation.
Las Bela princely state acceded to Pakistan in 1948. In 1955 it became a district of Kalāt division and in 1961 of Karāchi division; it was returned to Kalāt after 1972. Its population is Muslim. The Lumris or Lasis, whence the prefix Las, are the dominant tribal groups; other tribes include the Baluchi and Brahui.
