Red River Settlement,   (1811–36), colony in Canada on the banks of the Red River near the mouth of the Assiniboine River (in present-day Manitoba). The colony was founded in 1811–12 by Thomas Douglas, 5th earl of Selkirk, a Scottish philanthropist, who obtained from the Hudson’s Bay Company a grant of 116,000 square miles (300,000 square km) in the Red and Assiniboine river valleys. The official name of the settlement was Assiniboia (q.v.).
In the summer of 1811 Lord Selkirk sent a group of Scottish and Irish colonists to the Red River region by way of Hudson Bay, under Miles Macdonnell, the first governor of the colony; the party reached its destination in 1812. Subsequent parties of colonists followed in 1812, 1813, 1814, and 1815.
The Hudson’s Bay Company’s rival, the North West Company, induced a number of colonists to desert in 1815; the remainder were intimidated and driven from the settlement. The Hudson’s Bay Company quickly restored the colony, but it was broken up by the Nor’Westers a second time as a result of the Seven Oaks Massacre (q.v.) of 1816. In 1817 the colony was again reestablished by Lord Selkirk, who arrived with a force of military veterans recruited from former regiments. The colony survived thereafter without attack from the Nor’Westers, who merged with the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1821.
The Red River Settlement was administered by a governor and council appointed by Lord Selkirk and his heirs until 1836, when the Hudson’s Bay Company purchased the colony from the Selkirk estate and created the District of Assiniboia. The region became part of the province of Manitoba in 1870.
