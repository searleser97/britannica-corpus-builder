Amb,  former princely state, northern Pakistan. It was located along the west bank of the Indus River. Amb became part of Pakistan in 1947 and was formally abolished and incorporated within the North-West Frontier Province in 1969. The royal status of the Amb rulers was officially terminated in the early 1970s. The reservoir of the Tarbela Dam (completed in the mid-1970s) was responsible for the inundation of a large portion of Amb. The displaced residents of Amb settled throughout the broader region, most notably from Abbottabad to Muzaffarabad.
