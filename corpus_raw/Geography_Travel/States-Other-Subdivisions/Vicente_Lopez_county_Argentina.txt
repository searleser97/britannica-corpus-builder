Vicente López,  partido (county) of Gran (Greater) Buenos Aires, eastern Argentina. It is located directly north of the city of Buenos Aires, in Buenos Aires provincia (province), on the Río de la Plata estuary. Olivos is its cabecera (county seat).
Colonization of the area began with the second and permanent founding of Buenos Aires (1580). The region was called Costa de Monte Grande (later becoming the pago [country district] of Monte Grande in 1730) and included the present county of San Isidro. In 1706 the region became part of the parish of the San Isidro Labrador chapel, which in 1784 became San Isidro county. In 1905 the county of Vicente López was created out of San Isidro territory; its name honours the Argentine historian Vicente López, author of the country’s national anthem.
Localities within the county have many manufacturing and processing establishments that produce textiles, chemicals, lumber, metals, and food. Beach resort facilities are located along the coast of the county in the cities of Olivos and Vicente López. The Argentine presidential residence is located in Olivos.
With the growth of the national capital, the county of Vicente López has been absorbed into the north-northwestern suburban area of Gran Buenos Aires. The county experienced most population growth in the 1920s through 1950s. Three railway lines cross the county, and the national highway system connects it with Buenos Aires city and other parts of Argentina. Pop. (2001) 274,082; (2010) 269,420.
