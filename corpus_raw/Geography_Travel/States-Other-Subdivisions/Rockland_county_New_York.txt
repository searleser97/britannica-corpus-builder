Rockland,  county, southeastern New York state, U.S., consisting of a hilly region bordered by the Hudson River to the east and New Jersey to the southwest. Sandstone bluffs known as the Palisades border the Hudson where it narrows below the Tappan Zee area of the river. Among the other waterways are the Mahwah River, Rockland and DeForest lakes, and Lake Sebago. Harriman State Park, located in the northwestern section of the county, is the second largest state park in New York; several other state parks line the shore of the Hudson. Oak and hickory are the dominant forest types.
Algonquian-speaking Indians, such as the Wappinger, once hunted in the region. The Stony Point Battlefield commemorates a battle (July 16, 1779) fought during the U.S. War of Independence. The county was established in 1798. The 6-mile (9.7-km) Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson has linked Rockland and Westchester counties since the bridge’s completion in 1956, and in August 2017 the first span of its dramatic replacement—the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge—was opened.
The principal communities are Spring Valley, West Haverstraw, Pearl River, Suffern, Nyack, and New City, which is the county seat. The main economic activities are services (health and business), manufacturing (drugs and other chemicals), and retail trade. Rockland has the smallest area of any county in the state outside New York City. Area 174 square miles (451 square km). Pop. (2000) 286,753; (2010) 311,687.
