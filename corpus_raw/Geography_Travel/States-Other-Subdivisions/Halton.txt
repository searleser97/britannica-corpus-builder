Halton,  unitary authority, geographic county of Cheshire, northwestern England. The unitary authority comprises Widnes and surrounding suburban areas, on the north shore of the River Mersey in the historic county of Lancashire, and Runcorn and its suburbs, on the south shore of the Mersey in the historic county of Cheshire. The name Halton is ancient, and the barony of Halton created after the Norman Conquest (1066) included land on both sides of the Mersey.
Runcorn was a small agricultural settlement dominated by a castle first built in the early 10th century on Halton Hill. The building of the Bridgewater Canal (1761), and later the Old Quarry and Weaver canals, transformed Runcorn into an industrial town with tanneries, shipyards, and soap and chemical works.
Widnes was merely a small scatter of houses at Woodend until 1845, when the rail-canal-dock complex was completed on what was then called Widnes Dock, now Spike Island. Woodend was transformed into a centre of the alkali industry, established in 1847 by John Hutchinson. Soap manufacture and other chemical industries were also attracted to the growing town. Enormous quantities of toxic and evil-smelling waste from the alkali industry produced ugly refuse dumps, but the first Alkali Act of 1862 was the beginning of the slow introduction of stricter operating conditions. Widnes town centre developed in the second half of the 19th century around Victoria Square.
The environment improved slowly in the 1920s and â€™30s; after World War II there was a large building program and industrial diversification, but the chemical industry is still important. The first bridge across the Mersey at Runcorn, a high-level railway bridge, was completed in 1868; the Transporter bridge for road traffic was opened in 1905 and replaced in 1961. Area 31 square miles (79 square km). Pop. (2001) 118,208; (2011) 125,746.
