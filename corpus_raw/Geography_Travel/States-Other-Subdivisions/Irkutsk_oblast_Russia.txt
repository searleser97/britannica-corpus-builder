Irkutsk,  oblast (region), east-central Russia, occupying an area of 296,500 square miles (767,900 square km) west and north of Lake Baikal. It consists mostly of the hills and broad valleys of the Central Siberian Plateau and of its eastern extension, the Patom Plateau. In the south the oblast extends to the eastern crestline of the Sayan Mountains. Dense taiga dominated by Siberian and Dahurian larch, with pine, stone pine, fir, and spruce, occurs throughout the oblast; in the south there are small patches of mixed forest and steppe. Soils nearly everywhere are underlain by permafrost. Climate conditions are strongly continental. In 2008 the Ust-Ordyn Buryat autonomous okrug (district), inhabited mainly by Russians (about 60 percent) but also by Buryat (about 30 percent) and some Tatars, Ukrainians, and Belorussians, was merged with the Irkutsk oblast.
Irkutsk city is the administrative centre, and nearly all the oblast’s population is concentrated along the Trans-Siberian Railroad and the Angara River, where there is a developing industrial region based on Cheremkhovo and Azey coal, Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky iron ore, and local salt and mica deposits. Hydroelectricity is supplied by the Irkutsk, Bratsk, and Ust-Ilimsk dams on the Angara. Petroleum is piped to the oblast from the Volga-Urals oil field. Metallurgical, engineering, and chemical industries have grown rapidly in the main towns. In the northeast, near Bodaybo on the Vitim, gold is mined. Over the rest of the oblast, timber working is the only important industry. Agriculture is largely confined to the vicinity of the oblast’s towns. Reindeer herding and hunting are carried on by the Evenks of the north. The BAM (Baikal-Amur Magistral) Railroad cuts through the centre of the oblast, running east from Ust-Kut. Pop. (2002) 2,581,705; (2006 est.) 2,526,977.
