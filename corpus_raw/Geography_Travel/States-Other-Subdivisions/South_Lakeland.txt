South Lakeland,  district, administrative county of Cumbria, northwestern England. It lies in the southern part of the county, bordering the shallow Morecambe Bay of the Irish Sea to the south. The western part of the district, west of the River Winster and the northern Windermere (lake), is in the historic county of Lancashire. The eastern part of the district, including the Pennine uplands, Garsdale, Dentdale, and the area around Sedbergh, forms part of the Yorkshire Dales in the historic county of Yorkshire. The central part of the district, including Kendal, the administrative centre and largest town, is in the historic county of Westmorland.
South Lakeland is generally an upland district that is a popular vacation area. Central South Lakeland has lower hills and dales of the fertile Kent and Lune river valleys. The western and eastern uplands encompass parts of Lake District and Yorkshire Dales national parks, respectively, and rise to elevations of 1,500 to 3,000 feet (450 to 900 metres) above sea level. One of the narrow, lake-filled valleys contains Windermere, England’s largest freshwater lake. The Yorkshire Dales are rolling uplands of bleak moors. The rough grazing of sheep predominates in all the uplands, and dairy cattle as well as oats and fodder crops are raised in the valleys. Kendal and Ulverston are local agricultural and light industrial centres. Grasmere, Windermere, and Coniston are resorts in the Lake District. Some of the area west of Windermere has been replanted in coniferous forests. The Romantic poet William Wordsworth and the children’s writer Beatrix Potter found creative inspiration through observation of the district’s landscape. Area 592 square miles (1,533 square km). Pop. (2001) 102,301; (2011) 103,658.
