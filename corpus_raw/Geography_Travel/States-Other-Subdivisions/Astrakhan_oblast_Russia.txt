Astrakhan,  oblast (region), southwestern Russia. It occupies a low-lying area (much of it below sea level) along the lower Volga River and is bordered to the northeast by Kazakhstan. The Volga and its parallel distributary, the Akhtuba River, form the axis of the oblast, ending in a large delta on the Caspian Sea. The majority of the population lives in the delta area around the city of Astrakhan, the administrative centre.
Vegetables and fruit are grown on the fertile fields enriched by the Volga. Fishing is important along the rivers and Caspian shore, but it has suffered from pollution and the falling sea level. A major nature reserve in the delta protects the unique vegetation—including the lotus (Nelumbium caspicum)—and abundant birdlife—including pelicans and herons. Outside the floodplain and delta is an arid steppe–semidesert region, with sand dunes, saline soils and lakes, and a sparse sage vegetation; it is used only for extensive cattle and sheep raising and large-scale salt extraction at Lake Baskunchak. Area 17,027 square miles (44,100 square km). Pop. (2010) 1.010,073; (2014 est.) 1,016,516.
