The domestic stocking and knitting industries of Ilkeston declined in the 18th century, but by the mid-19th century both hosiery and lace factories were in operation and the town was growing rapidly. In the same period coal mining expanded. The annual fair, granted by a charter of 1252, is held at Ilkeston in October. Long Eaton was an agricultural community until the 19th century, when the development of a canal and later railways contributed to the growth of industry, particularly lace making (which collapsed in 1921). Today there is a wide range of industry, from heavy engineering to light crafts. Area 42 square miles (109 square km). Pop. (2001) 110,099; (2011) 112,081.
