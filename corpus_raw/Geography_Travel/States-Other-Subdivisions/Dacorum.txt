Dacorum,  borough (district), administrative and historic county of Hertfordshire, England. The borough, in the northwestern corner of the county, includes part of the range of chalk hills known as the Chilterns, which border the London Basin on the north. Dacorum embraces a number of the outer suburban communities of London, including the new town of Hemel Hempstead, which is the administrative centre of the borough and is located 25 miles (40 km) from central London.
The name Dacorum dates from as early as the 12th century, when it applied to one of the “hundreds,” or early administrative divisions of the English county. It seems likely that the name commemorates the presence in this area of Daci, or Danish, settlers. Area 82 square miles (212 square km). Pop. (2001) 137,799; (2011) 144,847.
