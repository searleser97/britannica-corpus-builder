Ávila,  provincia (province) in the Castile-León comunidad autónoma (autonomous community), central Spain, on the northern Meseta Central (plateau). Ávila is separated from Madrid province by the Sierra de Guadarrama to the east and from Toledo province by the Sierra de Gredos to the south. Agriculture predominates on the level ground in the north, but the soils are poor, relying on outwash from the central sierras. To the south, sierras rise steplike from the plateau to the Sierra de Gredos and are separated from each other by longitudinal valleys, the most important of which are Alberche, Adaja, and Tiétar.
There is little industrial development, and agriculture predominates throughout the province. The raising of stock, especially of Merino sheep, is the principal activity; the forests, mostly pine, are still economically important in places. Wheat and barley, with and without irrigation, are increasing in acreage. Rye, oats, corn (maize), sugar beets, and tobacco are also grown. Modern methods have been widely adopted; production of cereals exceeds consumption, and a surplus is exported to other parts of Spain. Agricultural processing is largely confined to the provincial capital, Ávila, and the chief market is the town of Arévalo. The Tiétar and Alberche valleys produce wines of some repute; olive cultivation is confined to a few sheltered localities (e.g., Arenas de San Pedro and Cebreros) with very high yield. The sierras formerly abounded in game; the diminution of the ibex (wild goat) of the Sierra de Gredos led to the creation of an ibex sanctuary in 1905. Area 3,108 square miles (8,050 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 168,638.
