Sverdlovsk,  oblast (region), west-central Russia. The oblast occupies an area along the eastern slopes of the Ural Mountains, stretching from the crestline, which reaches 5,148 feet (1,569 m) in Mount Konzhakovsky Kamen, to the West Siberian Plain. Almost the entire oblast is in swampy forest, or taiga, of pine, birch, and larch, with only the highest summits above the treeline; in the extreme south is forest-steppe with birch groves. Soils are poor, and agriculture is largely confined to the southeast.
About 90 percent of the population is urban, a reflection of the role of the oblast in the Urals industrial area. It is remarkably rich in minerals, including iron ore from Kachkana, Nizhny Tagil, Kushva, and elsewhere; manganese at Ivdel; cobalt, nickel, tungsten, and vanadium near Yekaterinburg; bauxite at Severouralsk; and beryllium near Asbest. One of the largest asbestos deposits in Russia occurs at Asbest, and copper, platinum, and gold are widely distributed. Coal and lignite are scarce, and the oblast lacks fuel, importing coal from the Kuznetsk Basin and natural gas from Tyumen oblast.
On the basis of the local mineral deposits, ironworking and copper working have been important in the region since the early 18th century, but today there is a varied and technologically modern metallurgical industry. Iron and steel are made at a number of centres, including one of the largest in Russia, at Nizhny Tagil; aluminum is made at Krasnoturinsk and Kamensk-Uralsky; and nickel is processed at Rezh and copper at several centres. Yekaterinburg and Nizhny Tagil are the chief centres of heavy engineering. The chemical and timber-working industries also are highly developed. Area 75,000 square miles (194,300 square km). Pop. (2006 est.) 4,409,731.
