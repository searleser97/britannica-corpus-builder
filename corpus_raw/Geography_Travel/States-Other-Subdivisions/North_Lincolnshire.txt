North Lincolnshire,  unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Lincolnshire, England. Scunthorpe is the unitary authority’s largest town and its administrative centre.
North Lincolnshire consists of a low plain on the south shore of the River Humber estuary that extends inland to the northernmost Lincolnshire Wolds and the reclaimed wetlands of the Isle of Axholme along the River Trent. The unitary authority covers a largely rural and agricultural area. Its fertile lands produce heavy yields of cereals, sugar beets, and vegetables. The unitary authority is also an important industrial centre, with two major oil refineries at Killingholme on the Humber, a large steel mill at Scunthorpe, and other industries, including food processing.
Among the area’s historic landmarks are Normanby Hall, a Regency country mansion completed in 1830, and the Old Rectory, the childhood home of John Wesley, in the village of Epworth. The Humber Bridge—the longest suspension-bridge span in the United Kingdom, with a length of 4,626 feet (1,410 metres)—connects the unitary authority with Kingston upon Hull and East Riding of Yorkshire. Area 327 square miles (846 square km). Pop. (2001) 152,849; (2011) 167,446.
