Thanet,  district, administrative and historic county of Kent, southeastern England, in the extreme northeast of the county. It roughly coincides with the historic Isle of Thanet, but the modern administrative district extends south of the Great Stour river almost to Sandwich. Margate is its administrative centre.
Thanet has 26 miles (42 km) of coastline on the Thames estuary and the Strait of Dover. There are several seaside resorts, including Margate, Broadstairs, and Ramsgate, and a large proportion of the people living in Thanet are 65 years of age or older. Increasing sea traffic between Ramsgate and French ports in the second half of the 20th century brought an expansion of related ground and air transportation facilities, warehousing, light industry, and hotels. Agriculture, traditionally concentrated on grains, now specializes in green vegetables and potatoes. Area 40 square miles (103 square km). Pop. (2001) 126,702; (2011) 134,186.
