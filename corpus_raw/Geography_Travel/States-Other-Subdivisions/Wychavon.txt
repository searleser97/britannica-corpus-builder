Wychavon,  district, administrative county of Worcestershire, west-central England. It is located in the southeastern part of the county. Pershore is the administrative centre.
Most of the district is in the historic county of Worcestershire, but the area around Hinton and Childwickham and the parishes of Ashton-under-Hill and Kemerton belong to the historic county of Gloucestershire. Wychavon district consists mostly of the fertile clay valleys of the Severn and (Upper) Avon rivers. The Vale of Evesham in the south and centre has the proper soil and climate for the cultivation of plums and various other fruits and vegetables. The steep limestone scarps of the Cotswolds uplands cross into Wychavon near the small parish (town) of Broadway in the extreme southeast. Isolated Bredon Hill in the southwest, nearly 1,000 feet (300 metres) high, is a spur of the Cotswolds.
Evesham, Pershore, and Droitwich are historic towns of Wychavon. Droitwich, in the northwest, has been known since Roman times for its saline springs and baths, said to be 10 times saltier than seawater. Evesham, in southeastern Wychavon, has the Round House (a large rectangular Tudor building with elaborate woodwork) and a town hall (built 1586; remodeled 1885). Pershore, west of Evesham, has a 17th-century bridge across the Avon and a thousand-year-old Norman abbey. Light industries include canneries at Evesham for locally grown fruits and vegetables. Area 257 square miles (666 square km). Pop. (2001) 112,957; (2011) 116,944.
