East Staffordshire,  borough (district), administrative county of Staffordshire, central England. The borough’s main locality and administrative headquarters is Burton upon Trent.
Nearly all of East Staffordshire lies within the historic county of Staffordshire, except for a small area around Rocester east of the River Dove and the section of Burton upon Trent east of the River Trent, both of which belong to the historic county of Derbyshire. East Staffordshire is essentially a gently rolling rural borough lying between the industrial areas of Stafford to the west, the West Midlands conurbation centring on Birmingham to the south, Derby to the east, and the northern Staffordshire coalfield region (centred on Stoke-on-Trent and also called the Potteries) to the north. It is drained to the east by the Rivers Trent and Dove.
The borough is an area of mixed farming, especially dairying. Burton upon Trent is one of England’s leading brewing centres; the Bass Museum there illustrates the history of brewing from the 18th century and the influence of the pub on social life. The parish of Uttoxeter, 14 miles (22 km) northwest of Burton upon Trent, is the site of one of England’s noted steeplechase courses. Area 149 square miles (387 square km). Pop. (2001) 103,770; (2011) 113,583.
