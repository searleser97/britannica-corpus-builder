San Juan,  provincia (province), west-central Argentina. It is separated from Chile to the west by the cordilleras of the Andes Mountains, whose peaks average between 14,800 and 16,400 feet (4,500 and 5,000 metres) in elevation. The south-central city of San Juan is the provincial capital.
Snow-fed rivers from the Andes dissect the province’s mountainous western terrain. Three main rivers, the Bermejo, Jáchal, and San Juan, all used for irrigation, discharge into marshes in the semiarid southeastern portion of the province. Ischigualasto Provincial Park in northeastern San Juan province and Talampaya National Park in neighbouring southwestern La Rioja province were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2000. Together, the two parks occupy more than 1,060 square miles (2,750 square km) of the desert region bordering the mountains.
San Juan was settled in the late 16th and early 17th centuries by small numbers of Spanish agriculturists, Dominicans, and Jesuits from Chile. A part of the old Cuyo region, it remained a sparsely populated area exporting wine and dried fruits that were produced in its irrigated valleys. In 1776 control over San Juan passed from the Chilean captaincy general to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. San Juan declared its own status as a province in 1825. It was the epicentre of severe earthquakes in 1776, 1944, and 1977.
Grapes grown for both the table and wine occupy half of the cultivated land; olives, apples, barley, and onions are also grown, and sheep and cattle are raised. San Juan is rich in copper reserves, but exploitation is limited. Economic activity in San Juan city and other urban centres is concentrated on food processing. The province is linked to Chile, with which much of its trade is carried on, by one local road across the Andes. Area 34,614 square miles (89,651 square km). Pop. (2001) 620,023; (2010) 681,055.
