It is bounded by the régions of Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes to the south, Centre to the west, and Île-de-France and Grand Est to the north. Switzerland lies to the east. The capital is Dijon.
In June 2014 French Pres. François Hollande announced a plan to reduce the number of régions in metropolitan France from 21 to 13. The reorganization was designed to address redundancies in regional bureaucracies and to reduce costs. In November 2014 the National Assembly approved the measure, and it took effect on January 1, 2016. The région of Bourgogne–Franche-Comté was thus created. Area 18,450 square miles (47,784 square km). Pop. (2015 est.) 2,820,940.
