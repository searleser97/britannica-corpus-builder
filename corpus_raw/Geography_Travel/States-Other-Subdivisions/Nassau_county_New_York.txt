Nassau,  county, southeastern New York state, U.S., on central Long Island just east of the borough (and county) of Queens, New York City. It consists of a coastal lowland region bordered to the north by Long Island Sound and to the south by the Atlantic Ocean. Embayments along the north shore include Manhasset and Oyster bays, while a string of barrier islands on the Atlantic coast enclose such bodies of water as East and South Oyster bays. Parklands include Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge and Bethpage, Hempstead Lake, and Jones Beach state parks.
Delaware Indians occupied the area when Dutch and English settlers arrived in the first half of the 17th century. By the Treaty of Hartford (1650), the territory west of a line drawn from Oyster Bay southward to the Atlantic was given to the Dutch, only to become part of the English province of New York in 1664. The area was occupied by the British during the U.S. War of Independence and was again subject to British harassment during the War of 1812. The region grew rapidly with the coming of the railroad in the 1840s, as numerous (often fashionable) suburban residential communities developed. Nassau county was created from Queens county in 1899 and named for the family of William III of England. Mineola is the county seat.
The county is divided administratively into three towns, or townships (Hempstead, North Hempstead, and Oyster Bay). Notable communities include the city of Long Beach, the villages of Garden City and Great Neck, and the planned community of Levittown. Hofstra University (founded 1935) in Hempstead, the State University of New York College at Old Westbury (1965), and the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point (1938; dedicated 1943) are the major institutions of higher education. Landmarks include Sagamore Hill, the former home of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and now a national historic site.
The economy is based on wholesale and retail trade and services (notably finance and health services). Area 287 square miles (743 square km). Pop. (2000) 1,334,544; Nassau-Suffolk Metro Division, 2,753,913; (2010) 1,339,532; Nassau-Suffolk Metro Division, 2,832,882.
