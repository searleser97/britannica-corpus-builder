Almería,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Andalusia, southeastern Spain, bordering the Mediterranean Sea. It was formed in 1833. Primarily mountainous, Almería is crossed by sierras in which terminate successive zones of the Baetic Cordillera. The intervening valleys of the Adra, Almanzora, and Andarax rivers provide the only fertile land. Despite an average annual rainfall of about 8 inches (200 mm), several important irrigation systems have considerably increased cultivation, which has also been boosted by the use of greenhouses. Fruit and vegetable growing is the principal agricultural activity, and large quantities of tomatoes, peppers, cabbage, green beans, oranges, and white grapes are exported. Sugarcane, almonds, and esparto are also produced. Livestock is raised, especially goats and sheep.
Mineral resources include iron, lead, and gold, and fine marble is quarried in the Sierra Nevada of the Baetic Cordillera. There is a flourishing ceramics industry at Níjar. Tourism is important because of the year-round resort areas along the Mediterranean coast. The village of Tabernas is the site of two solar power plants that are among the world’s most advanced. An astronomical observatory, jointly operated by Spain and Germany, is located at Calar Alto, where it takes advantage of the infrequency of cloud cover over the province (unusual in Europe).
Communications focus on Almería city, the provincial capital and a seaport. Other chief towns are Adra, Berja, Cuevas del Almanzora, El Ejido, Huércal-Overa, Garrucha, and Roquetas de Mar. Area 3,388 square miles (8,775 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 646,633.
