Cheshire East,  unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Cheshire, northwestern England. Cheshire East is bounded to the north by Greater Manchester, to the northeast by Derbyshire, to the east by Staffordshire, to the south by Shropshire, to the west by the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester, and to the northwest by the unitary authority of Warrington. It is flanked on the east by the Pennine uplands and is partly within the Peak District National Park. The administrative centre is Sandbach. The unitary authority, which comprises the former districts of Congleton, Crewe and Nantwich, and Macclesfield, was created in 2009 when the former administrative county of Cheshire was restructured.
The manufacture of pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and paper is important to the local economy, as is research and development. A number of towns in the former borough of Macclesfield are residential communities for Manchester commuters, including Poynton, Wilmslow, Alderley Edge, and Knutsford. Knutsford was the original Cranford in Elizabeth Gaskell’s novel of that name (1853). Much of the Cheshire East unitary authority is rural and agricultural, and large dairy farms predominate. Cheshire cheese is still made in only a few farmhouses and is now largely a factory product. Historic black-and-white half-timbered farmhouses are characteristic features of Cheshire East’s countryside. This vernacular style has also survived in several ancient towns, such as Nantwich. (For the history of the area, see Cheshire.) Area 450 square miles (1,166 square km). Pop. (2011) 370,127.
