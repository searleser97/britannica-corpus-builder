Surrey Heath,  borough (district) in the northwestern part of the administrative and historic county of Surrey, southeastern England. The borough owes its name to its natural vegetation. The sands and gravels that underlie the area yield an acidic infertile soil supporting rough heathland, scrub, and pine forest. Much of the borough is still common land, used for recreation, and other parts were taken over by the military in the 19th century for maneuvers and firing ranges. Although the borough is largely rural, Camberley (the administrative centre) and Frimley have undergone development and have some light industry. Area 37 square miles (95 square km). Pop. (2001) 80,314; (2011) 86,144.
