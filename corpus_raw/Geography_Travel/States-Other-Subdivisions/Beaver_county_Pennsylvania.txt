Beaver,  county, western Pennsylvania, U.S., bordered to the west by Ohio and West Virginia. It consists of a hilly region on the Allegheny Plateau drained by the Ohio and Beaver rivers. Other waterways include Ambridge Reservoir, Brush Creek, and Raccoon Creek, which runs through Raccoon Creek State Park.
The county was created in 1800. After founding utopian communities in nearby Butler county (1805) and in the state of Indiana (1814), George Rapp and his Pietist sect of Harmonists (Rappites) created an agricultural and manufacturing centre called Economy (1825–1906). The thriving community dwindled in the late 19th century. The American Bridge Company bought the village in 1901 and later renamed it Ambridge (1906). Old Economy Village features several restored buildings from the early settlement.
Among the county’s other communities are Aliquippa, Beaver Falls, Monaca, New Brighton, Baden, and Beaver, which is the county seat. The main economic activities are retail trade, services, and manufacturing, especially steel, glass, and electronic equipment. Area 435 square miles (1,127 square km). Pop. (2000) 181,412; (2010) 170,539.
