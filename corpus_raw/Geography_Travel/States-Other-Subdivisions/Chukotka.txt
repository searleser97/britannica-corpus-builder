Chukotka, in full Chukotsky Avtonomny Okrug, also called Chukot,  autonomous okrug (district), Russia, in the extreme northeastern portion of Siberia. Apart from the basin of the Anadyr River, most of the okrug is mountainous or hilly. Almost everywhere a severe Arctic climate permits only tundra vegetation, with some stunted forest in the south. The okrug was formed in 1930 for the Chukchi people, but they, together with small numbers of Evenk, Koryak, and Sakha (Yakut), were outnumbered by Russian settlers. The okrug is the leading Siberian gold area. Centres of gold production include the northern coast around and to the east of Cape Shmidta and the Bilibino area. There is also mining of tin, tungsten, and mercury in the north and some coal near the capital, Anadyr. Area 284,800 square miles (737,700 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) 50,263.
