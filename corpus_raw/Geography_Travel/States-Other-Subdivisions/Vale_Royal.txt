Vale Royal,  former borough (district), Cheshire West and Chester unitary authority, historic county of Cheshire, northwestern England. It is named for a great Cistercian abbey built by Edward I near the present village of Whitegate. The former borough was centred on the Cheshire salt field in the middle of the county. The areaâ€™s two main towns, Winsford and Northwich, were both founded on salt production; Northwich was important for salt as early as Roman times. In the 18th and 19th centuries the uncontrolled extraction of salt caused much subsidence both in the countryside and among the buildings of Northwich. The modern chemical industry of the area is still based on brine products. Winsford is famous for its rock salt mine, although extraction has declined. The borough has abundant agricultural land that is especially important for dairying. In the west, Delamere Forest, the remnant of a great medieval hunting ground, is an important recreational area.
