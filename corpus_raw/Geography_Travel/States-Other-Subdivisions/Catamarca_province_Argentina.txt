Catamarca,  provincia (province), northwestern Argentina, separated from Chile by the Andes Mountains. The province is generally mountainous with intermontane tablelands and valleys (some fertile, others completely arid). The sandy desert on the west side of the Aconquija Mountains is referred to as the Argentine Sahara. Catamarca city, in the southeast, is the provincial capital.
The region constituted part of the Inca empire after the 12th century, and pottery relics are still found. Spaniards, who settled the area in the 16th century, were subjects of the Viceroyalty of Peru. For many years after liberation from Spain (1816), the caudillos (military strongmen) of the Catamarca region and their gaucho armies resisted the Buenos Aires government. Wealthy landowners continued to have an independent spirit, and in 1946 President Juan Perón, to suppress local criticism, deposed the provincial governor and installed a nominee of his own. In 1943, when the northern national territory of Los Andes was divided, the department of Antofagasta de la Sierra was incorporated into Catamarca.
Scarcity of water has hindered agricultural development; irrigation, supporting mainly alfalfa, vineyards, olive and walnut groves, and cattle, provides only a partial remedy. Tungsten and mica are mined. The province’s virtual isolation accounts for a retention of traditions and has encouraged tourism. Catamarca city has rail and bus transportation facilities. Area 39,615 square miles (102,602 square km). Pop. (2001) 334,568; (2010) 367,828.
