South Hams,  southernmost district in the administrative and historic county of Devon, southwestern England. It extends from Dartmoor in the north to the English Channel in the south. Its scenery and rural character attract holiday visitors, retired people, and purchasers of second homes (especially in Stokenham, Salcombe, and Marlborough). The east-central town of Totnes is the administrative centre.
Part of Dartmoor National Park extends into the northern portion of South Hams. The moor is mainly heathland used extensively for the grazing of sheep, cattle, and ponies. The moor’s common grazing land is fringed by irregular fields that have extended up the main river valleys from the ancient peripheral villages. Dartmoor’s formerly drier, warmer climate brought considerable settlement during the Bronze Age, and old hut circles, enclosures, field boundaries, and stone monuments still remain.
The land falls from Dartmoor toward the coast in a series of steps, deeply incised by rivers flowing south from the moor. The steep sides of the valleys are generally wooded, and the floors form rich meadows. In the hedged fields between the rivers, dairying predominates, and Totnes is a centre for collecting, processing, and distributing milk products. Stock rearing is also important. Barley is the main crop; fruit, vegetables, and flowers are also cultivated.
The coastline extends for 51 miles (82 km) of picturesque headlands, cliffs, estuaries, and bays, forming the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Ports have grown up on the sheltered river mouths. Dartmouth, a historic port on the River Dart, is a yachting centre with marine and light engineering. On the branching Kingsbridge estuary are Salcombe, a holiday and residential town noted for sailing, and Kingsbridge, which has retail and tourist services. Area 342 square miles (887 square km). Pop. (2001) 81,849; (2011) 83,140.
