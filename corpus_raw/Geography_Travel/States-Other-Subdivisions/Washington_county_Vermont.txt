The city of Montpelier was named the Vermont state capital in 1805 and the county seat in 1811. The county was formed in 1810 and named for George Washington. The arrival of the Central Vermont Railroad to Barre in 1875 spurred the city’s growth as a centre of the granite industry, resulting in large-scale immigration. Local granite was used to construct the Vermont State House (built 1857) and Barre City Hall (built 1899). Norwich University (founded 1819), the oldest private military academy in the nation, was moved from Windsor county to Northfield in 1867. Goddard College (founded 1863) was relocated to the village of Plainfield from Barre in 1938. Other villages are Waterbury, East Montpelier, and Marshfield. The county contains 10 covered bridges.
