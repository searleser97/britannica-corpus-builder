Kano consists of wooded savanna in the south and scrub vegetation in the north and is drained by the Kano-Chalawa-Hadejia river system. The state’s light sandy soils are excellent for growing peanuts (groundnuts), a major export. Other crops include cotton, onions, indigo, tobacco, wheat, and gum arabic; millet, sorghum, beans, cowpeas, and corn (maize) are subsistence crops. Cattle, horses, goats, and sheep are grazed, and hides and skins are exported. Tin and columbite are mined.
Kano city, the state capital, is a manufacturing centre producing processed foods, textiles, furniture, cement, rolled steel, and light trucks. Most of the state’s inhabitants are Hausa or Fulani, but there are also Nigerians from other parts of the country, Arab traders, and Europeans.
