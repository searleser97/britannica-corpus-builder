Medway,  unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Kent, southeastern England. It is named for, and lies around the mouth of, the River Medway where it flows into the estuary of the Thames.
The unitary authority comprises the ports of Chatham (the administrative centre) and Gillingham and the town of Rainham south of the Medway and the historic cathedral city of Rochester north of the Medway. Those adjacent urban centres are sometimes referred to as the “Medway Towns.” To the north and east of Rochester, the unitary authority includes a section of the marshes and flats along the Thames. A detached portion of the latter, the Isle of Grain, has been diked and reclaimed and is now the site of a large oil refinery. The areas along the Medway are largely industrialized. From the 15th century until 1984 Chatham had one of Britain’s major naval dockyards. Besides this and the oil refinery at Grain, there are numerous engineering plants lining the river frontage of the Medway. Area 74 square miles (192 square km). Pop. (2001) 249,488; (2011) 263,925.
