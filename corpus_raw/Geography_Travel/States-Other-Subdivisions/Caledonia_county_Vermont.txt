Caledonia,  county, northeastern Vermont, U.S., bounded on the southeast by New Hampshire, the Connecticut River constituting the border. Piedmont terrain occupies most of the county except the northeastern corner, which lies in a highland region. The principal waterways are the Passumpsic, Lamoille, Wells, and Moose rivers, as well as Lake Groton, Harvey Lake, and Peacham Pond. The main species of timber are spruce, fir, white pine, and hard maple. Recreational lands include Groton and Willoughby state forests and Burke Mountain Ski Area.
The county, formed in 1792, was named Caledonia—the historic name of Scotland through the 11th century—because many early settlers were Scottish. The county seat is St. Johnsbury, which developed into a manufacturing centre after the arrival of the Fairbanks family in the early 19th century; Thaddeus Fairbanks invented the platform scale in 1830. The family founded St. Johnsbury Academy (1842), the Athenaeum (1871), and the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium (1889).
The county’s economy now rests primarily on manufacturing, retail trade, and health care services. Logging and maple sugar production are also important. Area 651 square miles (1,686 square km). Pop. (2000) 29,702; (2010) 31,227.
