Santiago,  región metropolitana, central Chile, bordering Argentina on the east, Valparaíso region on the north and west, and O’Higgins region on the south. Santiago, created a province in 1826 and a metropolitan region in 1974, is divided into the provinces of Santiago, Chacabuco, Cordillera, Maipo, Melipilla, and Talagante. It spans the fertile Central Valley and the Andean cordillera. Winter rains and snowmelt in the watershed of the Maipo River supply the water used for power development and for farm and urban needs. River canyons provide summer recreation areas and access to winter resorts (Farellones, Lagunillas, and Refugio lo Valdés).
Santiago is Chile’s major industrial and agricultural region. The bulk of Chile’s industrial and commercial activity is concentrated in the national and regional capital of Santiago, but there are important farm-supply, marketing, and processing activities at San Bernardo (location of major railroad shops), Puente Alto (a paper- and gypsum-processing centre), Melipilla, Talagante, and Buin. Dairying and beef production are significant; the main crops are grains, grapes, potatoes, and beans. Copper, gypsum, and limestone are mined. Marketing is facilitated by the proximity of urban centres, by main-line railroad communications, and by the best-developed regional road system in Chile. Area 5,947 square miles (15,403 square km). Pop. (2002) 5,428,590; (2017) 7,112,808.
