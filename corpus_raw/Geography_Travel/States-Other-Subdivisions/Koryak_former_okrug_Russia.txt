Koryak, also spelled Koriak,  former autonomous okrug (district), far eastern Russia. In 2007 Koryak was merged with Kamchatka oblast (region) to form Kamchatka kray (territory). The Koryak area occupies the northern half of the Kamchatka Peninsula, the southern end of the Koryak Mountains, and the Penzhina Basin. The relief is rugged and the climate is severe. Vegetation consists of tundra or thin birch forest, with some larch in the Penzhina Basin. The area is very sparsely populated; there are no towns and only several urban settlements, including the administrative centre of the former district, Palana. The chief occupation is fishing (especially for crab) from the small settlements along the coast, while fur hunting and reindeer herding are important inland. A little coal is also mined, and some timber is cut in the Penzhina Basin. The population is composed of Russians (about 65 percent), Koryak (about 20 percent), and small numbers of Ukrainians, Chukchi, and Itelmen. Area 116,400 square miles (301,500 square km). Pop. (2006 est.) 25,157.
