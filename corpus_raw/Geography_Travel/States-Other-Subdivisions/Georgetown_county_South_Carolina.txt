Georgetown,  county, eastern South Carolina, U.S. The Atlantic Ocean is the eastern border, the Great Pee Dee River the irregular northeastern border, and the Santee River the southern border. It also is drained by the Waccamaw, Black, and Sampit rivers, which empty into Winyah Bay. A portion of the Sea Islands, with their sandy beaches, line the coast, and swamps and pine forests cover much of the inland area.
The region was inhabited by Siouan-speaking Winyah Indians when Europeans began settling Carolina in the 1670s. During the colonial era rice and indigo cultivation made it important agriculturally. Georgetown county was established in 1785 and named for George II of England. The deep harbour at the town of Georgetown, the county seat, made it a crucial port of entry for supplies during the U.S. War of Independence; the British seized the town in 1780 and destroyed it the next year. The county first became noted as a resort area in the 18th century; Huntington Beach State Park and oceanside communities such as Murrells Inlet, Litchfield Beach, and Pawleys Island continue to attract vacationers who enjoy fishing and swimming.
Tourism, commercial fishing, lumbering, and textile, steel, and paper production are important elements in the economy, but, apart from tobacco growing, agriculture is a minor element. Area 815 square miles (2,110 square km). Pop. (2000) 55,823; (2010) 60,158.
