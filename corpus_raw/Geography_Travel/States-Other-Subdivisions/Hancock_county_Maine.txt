Hancock,  county, southeastern Maine, U.S. It is located in a mountain-and-valley region bounded to the west by the Penobscot River and to the south by several bays of the Atlantic Ocean and includes many islands. The rugged coastline was formed by a flooded mountain range; Mount Desert Island features Cadillac Mountain (1,532 feet [467 metres]), the highest Atlantic coast summit in Maine, and Somes Sound, the only fjord along the East Coast. There are many marshlands and waterways, including Graham and Nicatous lakes and the Union River. State recreational areas include Holbrook Island Sanctuary and Lamoine state parks. The main forest type is spruce and fir, with stands of maple, aspen, and birch.
