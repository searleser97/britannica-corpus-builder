Stirling,  council area, central Scotland. The area south of Loch Katrine and the River Forth lies within the historic county of Stirlingshire, and the area to the north belongs to the historic county of Perthshire. It borders Loch Lomond to the west and spans the Highland Boundary Fault, which separates the Highlands in the north and west from the Lowlands. Towering above the Lowlands, with abrupt slopes of about 1,000 feet (300 metres) in places, are the intrusive volcanic Campsie Fells. The Lowlands, which drain into the River Forth, are thickly mantled with glacial deposits, and raised beaches flank the alluvial flats along the Forth. Annual rainfall decreases from 100 inches (2,500 mm) in the northwestern Highlands to 30 inches (760 mm) along the Forth.
In the wetter north and west, pastoralism predominates; cattle are fattened, and dairying is important. In the southeast, particularly on the alluvial carse (fertile riverine lands), farmers raise crops as well as livestock. The coalfield in the southeast, which underlay the growth of heavy industry in and around Stirling town in the 19th century, is now largely exhausted, and coal mining has virtually ceased in Stirling council area. However, most of the population still lives in the southeast. Tourism is important to the local economy, especially in the scenic Highlands. Stirling is the council areaâ€™s administrative centre and largest town. Area 844 square miles (2,187 square km). Pop. (2001) 86,212; (2011) 90,247.
