Bridgend, Welsh Pen-y-Bont ar Ogwr,  county borough, historic county of Glamorgan (Morgannwg), southern Wales. Bridgend county borough extends from the mining valleys of Ogmore, Garw, and Llynfi in the north to the arable lowlands and an extensive coastline in the south. The town of Bridgend is the administrative centre of the county borough.
Discoveries of Bronze Age and Iron Age artifacts have been made near the village of Merthyr Mawr, and the remains of many Norman castles give further evidence of the areaâ€™s long history. Ogmore Castle, situated in the Ogmore river valley between Bridgend town and Ogmore-by-the-Sea, is one of these; it was founded in 1116 by William de Londres, and its stone keep is one of the earliest built in Wales. Others are Coity Castle (also built in the 12th century), located north of Bridgend town, and Candleston Castle (14th century), near Merthyr Mawr.
Mining was once important in the northern part of the county borough, but it had  ceased by the end of the 20th century. New industries (engineering, clothing manufacture, and cosmetics) have been introduced, particularly in the town of Maesteg, in the Llynfi valley. Agriculture remains economically important in the south. The town of Bridgend has industrial and commercial estates and shopping centres. Porthcawl is one of the leading coastal resorts in South Wales. The M4 motorway connects Bridgend with Cardiff and Newport to the east and with Swansea to the west. Area 97 square miles (251 square km). Pop. (2001) 128,645; (2011) 139,178.
