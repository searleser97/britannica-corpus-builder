Veneto, also called Venezia Euganea,  regione, northern and northeastern Italy, comprising the provincie of Venezia, Padova, Rovigo, Verona, Vicenza, Treviso, and Belluno. It is bounded by Trentino–Alto Adige (north), Emilia-Romagna (south), Lombardia (Lombardy; west), Austria (northeast), and Friuli–Venezia Giulia and the Adriatic Sea (east). The northern limit of Veneto is marked by a mountainous area, including the Dolomites, between Lake Garda (southwest) and the Carnic Alps to the northeast. The southern part consists of a fertile plain extending to the Gulf of Venice and drained chiefly by the Po, Adige, Brenta, Piave, and Livenza rivers, the mouths of which form an extensive delta area with shore lagoons.
Veneto is a chief producer of corn (maize), wheat, sugar beets, and hemp. Dairy-cattle fodder and fruit (apples, pears, peaches, cherries), and wine grapes are also grown. There is much irrigation, and considerable land has been reclaimed, especially in the Po River delta. After World War II, large estates were expropriated for distribution to smallholders. The region uses hydroelectric power from the swift streams of the Alpine area.
The larger towns of the plain have textile, silk, lace, hemp, paper, founding, and shipbuilding industries, as well as sugar refining and food processing. Besides Venice, the capital, the principal cities are Verona, Rovigo, Padua, Vicenza, and Treviso. The regione has a dense road and rail network and is connected by motorway to Milan and Turin. Venice is connected to the mainland by a road bridge and rail bridge. Area 7,090 square miles (18,364 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) 4,832,340.
