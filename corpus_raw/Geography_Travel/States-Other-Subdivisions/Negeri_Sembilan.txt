Negeri Sembilan, formerly Negri Sembilan,  state (negeri), southwestern Peninsular (West) Malaysia (Malaya), bounded by the states of Selangor (northwest), Pahang (north), Johor (east), and Melaka (south). Its area of  is drained by the Linggi and Mirar rivers and has a 30-mile (48-km) coastline on the Strait of Malacca.
Its princes, who trace their ancestry from the monarchs of Śrivijaya (a maritime empire based on Sumatra), came from Minangkabau (Sumatra) and Celebes in the 14th century. The Minangkabaus brought a matrilineal society and laws known as Adat Perpateh to the peninsula. Their culture and architecture, while not widespread, are unique to the state.
Nine states (negeri sembilan), including parts of present-day Selangor, Melaka, Johor, and Pahang, were loosely confederated in 1773. The British, interested in the key tin-producing state of Sungei Ujong, offered the group protection after 1874, which was accepted. Negri Sembilan became one of the Federated Malay States (1895) and after World War II it joined the Federation of Malaya.
The state is now ruled by a constitutional sultan (Yang di-Pertuan Besar) selected from the territorial chiefs, a system peculiar among Malaysian states.
The inhabitants engage in paddy (rice) farming at the bottoms of the steep-sided valleys; fruit cultivation is also common and rubber trees are extensively grown. A few declining alluvial tin mines are in the western valleys and along the coast. The towns are dominated by Chinese and Indians. Negeri Sembilan contains part of the west coast “tin and rubber” belt road network, one of the few east–west peninsular routes, and there is a junction of railway lines on either side of the mountains at Gemas. The main towns are Seremban (q.v.; the capital), Kuala Pilah, and Port Dickson. Area 2,565 square miles (6,642 square km). Pop. (2005 est.) 946,300.
