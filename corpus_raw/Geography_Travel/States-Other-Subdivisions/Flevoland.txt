Flevoland,  provincie (province), central Netherlands. It consists of three polders reclaimed from the eastern side of Lake IJssel (IJsselmeer), part of the former Zuiderzee. Flevoland province was established in 1986 and includes the municipalities of Almere and Zeewolde on South (Zuidelijk) Flevoland Polder, Dronten and Lelystad on East (Oostelijk) Flevoland Polder, and Noordoostpolder and Urk on Northeast (Noordoost) Polder. The South and East Flevoland polders form a continuous expanse of rich marine clay separated from the Northeast Polder to the north by the 1- to 3-mile- (1.6- to 5-km-) wide Lake Ketel, from Overijssel and Gelderland provinces to the east and southeast by the narrow Lake Veluwe, and from Utrecht and Noord-Holland provinces to the south and southwest by the narrow Gooi and Eem lakes. The Northeast, the East Flevoland, and the South Flevoland polders were completed in 1942, 1957, and 1968, respectively.
The province produces apples, cereals, and flowers and contains dairy cattle. It also functions as a residential area for the “overspill” from the northern Randstad and is used for light industrial and recreational purposes. The major population centre and provincial capital is Lelystad on Lake IJssel in East Flevoland Polder. Area 931 square miles (2,412 square km). Pop. (2009 est.) 383,449.
