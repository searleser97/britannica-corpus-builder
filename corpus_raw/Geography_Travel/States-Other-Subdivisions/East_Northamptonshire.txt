East Northamptonshire,  district, administrative and historic county of Northamptonshire, south-central England, in the northeastern part of the county. Thrapston, east of Kettering, is the administrative centre.
The district spans some 27 miles (43 km) from north to south and is about 14 miles (22 km) across at its widest point. It is covered with fertile glacial drift, and the gently rolling clay hills, 200 to 300 feet (60 to 90 metres) in elevation, are bisected north-south for the length of the district by the River Nene. East Northamptonshire has a mixed urban- and rural-based economy with significant contributions from the manufacturing, distribution, agricultural, and tourism sectors; no one sector or employer dominates. The four manufacturing towns at the district’s southern end (Rushden, Irthlingborough, Higham Ferrers, and Raunds) grew as a result of the development of the boot- and shoe-making industry, for which the district—especially its southern portion—was historically world-renowned. That industry gradually declined in the late 20th century, but its legacy lingers in the culture of the local economy, which is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises.
Farther north in the Nene Valley is an area of mixed farming for which Oundle and Thrapston serve as local market centres. Oundle contains fine examples of 17th- and 18th-century town houses and 17th-century hostelries. Remnants of the Rockingham Forest, a former royal hunting preserve, are in the western part of the district. Parks abound in East Northamptonshire. The extraordinary natural assets of the Nene Valley draw national and international visitors to the area to traverse its wildlife-rich riverine landscape by boat, bicycle, or foot. In addition to a variety of overwintering birds (curlew, gadwal, lapwing, and widgeon, among others), the valley is also home to kites, kingfishers, and otters. Area 197 square miles (510 square km). Pop. (2001) 76,550; (2011) 86,765.
