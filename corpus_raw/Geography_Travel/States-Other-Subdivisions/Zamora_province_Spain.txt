Zamora,  provincia (province) in the comunidad aut贸noma (autonomous community) of Castile-Le贸n, northwestern Spain. It was formed in 1833 from part of the historic province of Le贸n and is bounded by the provinces of Le贸n to the north, Valladolid to the east, and Salamanca to the south; Portugal bounds it to the west. It is traversed from east to west by the Duero (Portuguese: Douro) River; the Tormes River skirts the southwestern boundary for about 25 miles (40 km). Except in the northwest, where it is entered by two outlying ridges of the Cantabrian Mountains, the surface is a level or slightly undulating plateau. Its plains, especially the Esla Valley, yield much grain (barley and wheat) and pulse; wine and flax are also produced, and on higher grounds Merino sheep and goats are raised for wool and cheese. Large dams on the Esla and Duero rivers generate hydroelectric energy. The provincial capital, Zamora city, is the main communications centre; other cities and towns include Benavente and Toro. Area 4,078 square miles (10,561 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 197,237.
