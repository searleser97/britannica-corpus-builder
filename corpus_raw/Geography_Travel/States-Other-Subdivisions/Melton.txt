Melton,  borough (district), administrative and historic county of Leicestershire, south-central England, in the northeastern part of the county. Melton borough encompasses partly wooded, rolling countryside, with an elevation around 400 feet (120 metres), and is dotted with stone-built villages. The only town of consequence, Melton Mowbray, has an important cattle market and is the administrative headquarters in the borough’s centre.
The borough’s rich pastureland is grazed by New Leicester sheep (first bred locally), cattle (both beef and dairy), and pigs. During World War II a considerable amount of the borough’s land was plowed for the first time in centuries, but since then much of it has reverted to pasture. Pies made of pork and locally produced Stilton cheese have long been associated with Melton Mowbray.
Industries produce hosiery, knitwear, and processed pet foods. Horses and dogs are trained in the vicinity for use by the military. Ironstone is extracted at Holwell and Asfordby, north of Melton Mowbray. The cruciform Church of St. Mary (built 1280–1330) in Melton Mowbray contains rare double-aisled transepts. Foxhunting traditionally has been a popular local sport; sites such as Belvoir in the borough and its vicinity had particular hunts named for them. Area 186 square miles (482 square km). Pop. (2001) 47,866; (2011) 50,376.
