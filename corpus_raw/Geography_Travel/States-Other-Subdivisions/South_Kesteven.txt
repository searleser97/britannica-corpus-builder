South Kesteven,  district, administrative and historic county of Lincolnshire, east-central England, lying in the southwestern part of the county. Grantham, the districtâ€™s administrative centre, is in the northwest.
There are fertile pasturelands on the western borders with Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, but the bulk of South Kesteven district is a limestone plateau oriented north-south. Lying at an elevation of 200 to 400 feet (60 to 120 metres), the plateau has a steep western scarp and descends gradually eastward, crossing a treeless expanse before touching the outer limits of the Fens, an extensive area of reclaimed marshland near sea level that produces wheat, barley, and sugar beets and other root crops. Bourne and, especially, Stamford are well-preserved ancient market towns at the edge of the Fens and have textile, footwear, and stone-trade industries. Stamford was the first place in England or Wales to be designated a conservation area under the Civic Amenities Act (1967), which preserves the character of areas of special architectural or historical interest.
Agricultural implements and machinery are manufactured at Grantham, and sheep are pastured in the nearby limestone uplands. The adjacent parishes (towns) of Market Deeping and Deeping St. James are expanding agricultural communities within the Fens. Sir Isaac Newton and Dame Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to be prime minister of the United Kingdom, spent their formative years around Grantham. Area 364 square miles (943 square km). Pop. (2001) 124,792; (2011) 133,788.
