Pendle,  borough (district), administrative county of Lancashire, northwestern England, on the eastern boundary of the county. Most of the borough—including its largest towns Burnley, Nelson, and Colne—lies in the historic county of Lancashire, but an area in the northeast, including the towns of Barnoldswick and Earby, belongs to the historic county of Yorkshire.
The borough takes its name from Pendle Hill, with an elevation of 1,831 feet (707 metres), and Pendle Forest, famous for their association with Lancashire witches in the 17th century. In the early 18th century woolen textiles were an important domestic industry, but they were replaced by cotton by the end of the century, when the Leeds and Liverpool Canal allowed easy transport of the raw cotton from Liverpool. More recently, industrial diversification added engineering, including Rolls-Royce at Barnoldswick, and the manufacture of furniture, carpets, and plastics. Much of the area is rural, and agriculture is important. Area 66 square miles (170 square km). Pop. (2001) 89,248; (2011) 89,452.
