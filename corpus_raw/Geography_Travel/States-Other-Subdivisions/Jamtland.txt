Jämtland,  län (county) of western Sweden, on the Norwegian border. It takes in the traditional landskap (provinces) of Jämtland and Härjedalen. The land rises in the west to 5,780 feet (1,762 metres) but falls to below 1,500 feet in the east. It is drained by the rivers Ljungan, Indalsälven, Ångermanälven, and Ljusnan; Storsjön is the largest of its many lakes. The region around Storsjön has been settled since pre-Christian times.
Frösön, an island in Storsjön, was the ancient capital, as well as the site of a sacrificial temple. The northernmost rune stone in Sweden was erected near the lakeshore in about 1050. Except for a brief period (1563–70), Jämtland was part of Denmark’s Norwegian domains until 1645.
The core of Jämtland is a relatively fertile lowland that lends itself to agriculture. Dairying is a chief occupation, together with lumbering and quarrying. The beautiful lake scenery and wild mountains with many waterfalls also make the län a tourist area. Östersund is the capital, and Åre is a popular resort. Area 20,888 square miles (54,100 square km). Pop. (2005 est.) 127,424.
