The Cherokee, British, and patriots fought often in the area during the U.S. War of Independence. Spartanburg county was established in 1785 and named for the Spartan Rifles, a local militia force during the Revolution. It soon became a resort region known for its mineral springs. Agriculture was the principal occupation, cotton the dominant crop. Soil depletion, erosion, and boll weevil infestations forced farmers to other activities, including growing peaches (production of which is now considerable) and raising cattle.
