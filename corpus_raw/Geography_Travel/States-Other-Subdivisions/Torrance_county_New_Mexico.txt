Torrance,  county, central New Mexico, U.S. It lies in the Basin and Range Province, with the western portion including the Manzano Mountains, topped by Manzano Peak (10,098 feet [3,077 metres]). Most of Torrance county is an area of rolling plains interrupted by ridges, hills, and mesas and scarred by the dry beds of streams; it includes the long, wide Estancia Basin. Within county borders are the Cibola National Forest, Manzano Mountain Wilderness, Isleta Indian Reservation (Pueblo), Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument, and Manzano Mountain State Park.
Pueblos were thriving in the region by the time Juan de Oñate’s expedition arrived in 1598. But the Pueblo Indians’ cooperation with the Spanish in slave raids against the nearby Apaches led to retaliation by the Apaches; moreover, both tribes were raided by Comanches from the Plains. Pueblos such as the ones at Tajique and Quarai were abandoned as a result of recurring warfare. Sheep and cattle ranchers were operating in the region by the mid-19th century, and Torrance county was established in 1903.
During the 1940s, Torrance was principally a farming area, a major producer of pinto beans. Subsequently, drought devastated the county. Cattle are now the chief agricultural product. Estancia is the county seat and Moriarty is the largest town. Area 3,345 square miles (8,664 square km). Pop. (2000) 16,911; (2010) 16,383.
