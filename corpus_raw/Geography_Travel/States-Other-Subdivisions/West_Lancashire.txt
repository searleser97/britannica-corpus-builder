West Lancashire,  district, administrative and historic county of Lancashire, northwestern England, north of the city of Liverpool. Ormskirk, in the southwest, is the districtâ€™s administrative centre.
West Lancashire is separated from the Irish Sea by the narrow coastal strip of Sefton except in the north at the mouth of the River Ribble. The district is essentially a low-lying coastal plain, much of it reclaimed marshland, although marshes in the extreme north have not been drained. Its proximity to large urban centres encourages intensive market gardening of the rich peat soils. Glacial moraines are found at higher elevations in the southeast near Skelmersdale.
Ormskirk, an agricultural centre, preserves much of its medieval market town character. Its street market is said to date to some 700 years ago. Skelmersdale, the other centre, has experienced industrial relocation and town development and expansion since being designated a new town in 1961. The Rufford Old Hall in the small town of Rufford is a fine example of a late medieval timber-framed building. Area 134 square miles (347 square km). Pop. (2001) 108,378; (2011) 110,685.
