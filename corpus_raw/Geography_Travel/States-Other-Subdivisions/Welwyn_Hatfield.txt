Welwyn Hatfield,  district, administrative and historic county of Hertfordshire, southeastern England, directly north of the metropolitan county of Greater London. Welwyn Garden City is the district seat.
Welwyn Hatfield district is an area of rolling open countryside within the Thames basin, and its southern sections are part of the Greater London Green Belt. Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield, located 3 miles (5 km) apart and about 30 miles northwest of central London, were both designated as new towns in the late 1940s to help meet Londonâ€™s urgent postwar housing needs. Welwyn Garden City was founded in 1920 by Sir Ebenezer Howard, the originator of the garden city movement, and many experiments of combined rural-and-urban living have been undertaken in the town.
Dairy farming, market gardening, and seed-growing nurseries are the principal economic activities in the southern Green Belt. Welwyn Garden City has a wide variety of light industries, including electronics, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and food processing. An aircraft-manufacturing plant at Hatfield closed in the mid-1990s, and the site was redeveloped as a business centre. East of Hatfield is the early 16th-century Hatfield House, an E-shaped building constructed for Robert Cecil, 1st earl of Salisbury, that includes a section of the redbrick Tudor palace where Elizabeth I spent her childhood. Area 50 square miles (130 square km). Pop. (2001) 97,553; (2011) 110,535.
