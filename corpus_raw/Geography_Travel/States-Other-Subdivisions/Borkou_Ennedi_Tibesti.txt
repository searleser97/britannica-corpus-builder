Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti (BET),  former large prefecture (administrative division) of northern Chad. The region occupies much of the southeast-central portion of the Sahara, and the terrain is primarily low-lying arid desert that rises in the northwest to the lofty massif of the Tibesti. The sparse population consists mainly of nomadic and seminomadic Arab, Amazigh (Berber), and Teda peoples. Faya (formerly Largeau), the former prefectural capital, is centrally located.
The region was historically important as a crossroads in the trans-Saharan trade between West Africa and Cyrenaica (Libya); the hajj (pilgrimage) route from West Africa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia also passed through it. In the early 1900s it came under French control when the resistance of the Sanūsī brotherhood was somewhat subdued. The French considered the region ungovernable, and, following Chad’s independence in 1960, BET remained under French military administration. The French finally withdrew from the area in January 1965, and the region was incorporated into the Chadian republic. BET’s nomadic groups resented the excessive and rather corrupt actions of the Chadian administration and military, and clashes soon erupted. Later that year the death of a Chadian soldier in the village of Bardai prompted the army to carry out brutal reprisals against civilians, which fueled a rebellion against the government.
Attempts to administratively reorganize the prefecture began in 1999, and in 2008 it was divided into Borkou, Ennedi, and Tibesti regions. Area Borkou, 93,050 square miles (241,000 sq km); Ennedi 81,470 square miles (211,000 sq km); Tibesti, 50,190 square miles (130,000 sq km). Pop. (2009 prelim.) Borkou, 97,251; Ennedi, 173,606; Tibesti, 21,970.
