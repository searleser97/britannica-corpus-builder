Granada,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Andalusia, southern Spain, on the Mediterranean coast. Its varied landscapes range from the arid zones of the Guadix and Baza plains in the north and centre to the fertile valleys and beaches of the Costa del Sol in the south. Granada is not a wealthy province. The economy is predominantly agricultural, with cereals (barley and wheat) as the most widely grown crop, although sugarcane and, especially, tobacco are also important. Olive and fruit trees (oranges, lemons, figs, almonds, and pomegranates) and vineyards are common. The principal industries are agriculture-based and include sugar refining, although manufacturing is carried on in Granada city, the provincial capital.
The province contains the lead mines of the Sierra de Gador (the richest in the world during the 19th century), and the Marquesado de Zenete region is one of Spain’s largest producers of iron ore. The Granada coast (part of the Costa del Sol) includes the thriving beach resorts of Motril, Salobreña, and Almuñécar. Other important towns are Guadix, Loja, and Baza. The service industry, especially tourism, has grown in importance. Area 4,883 square miles (12,647 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 884,099.
