Genève,  (French), English Geneva, German Genf,  canton, southwestern Switzerland. The canton lies between the Jura Mountains and the Alps and consists mainly of its capital, the city of Geneva (Genève). It is one of the smallest cantons in the Swiss Confederation. Bordering on Vaud canton for 3.5 miles (5.5 km) in the extreme north, it is otherwise surrounded by French territory—the département of Haute Savoie to the south and that of Ain west and north. The canton is drained by the Rhône River from east to west and then along its southwest edge, and by the turbid L’Arve River, which flows from Mont Blanc to join the Rhône within the city of Geneva.
Admitted into the Swiss Confederation in 1815, Genève was increased in 1815–16 by adding to the old territory belonging to the city 16 communes (to the south and east) ceded by Savoy and 6 communes (to the north) from the French district of Gex. The population, about one-third Roman Catholic and one-fifth Protestant, is primarily French speaking.
Industry is concentrated in the city of Geneva and its suburbs. Market gardens, vineyards, and orchards occupy a large proportion of the canton’s soil. Area 109 square miles (282 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 433,235.
