Forest of Dean,  district, administrative county of Gloucestershire, south-central England, in the western part of the county. Most of the district belongs to the historic county of Gloucestershire, but the villages of Staunton and Redmarley Dâ€™Abitot and the surrounding area belong to the historic county of Worcestershire. Coleford, in the west, is the administrative centre.
The district is bordered on the southeast by the broad estuary of the River Severn and on the southwest by the River Wye, which (for the most part) forms the border with Wales. The district takes its name from one of the great primeval forests of England that still covers much of the 500- to 800-foot- (150- to 245-metre-) high sandstone ridges and valleys of the south-central part of the district. The woodland area was designated a National Forest Park in 1938. Its oaks, ashes, beeches, birches, and ferns have overlapped a former coalfield and an ancient ironworks much used by the Crusaders. Timber from the forest was utilized in the construction of ships between the 16th and 18th centuries.
Coleford, Cinderford, and Mitcheldean, all former coal-mining centres, are parishes (towns) in the region. Sheep and cattle are raised, and dairying is the most significant economic endeavour along the fertile strip of lowland bordering the Severn. Limestone is quarried from the cliffs above the Wye valley. Dairy cattle also graze the fertile loams and marls of the Vale of Newent west of the city of Gloucester in the northern part of the district. Greenhouse produce (including lettuce, cucumbers, and tomatoes) is grown there, as are apples and pears for cider and perry (fermented pear juice). The Newent area is known for its fields of wild daffodils. Light industrial manufactures of the district include automobile accessories and plastics. Area 203 square miles (527 square km). Pop. (2001) 79,982; (2011) 81,961.
