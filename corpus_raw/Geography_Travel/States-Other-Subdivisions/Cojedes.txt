Cojedes,  inland estado (state), northwestern Venezuela. It is surrounded by the states of Yaracuy and Carabobo on the north, Gu√°rico on the east, Barinas on the south,  Portuguesa on the west, and Lara on the northwest.
Since colonial days, cattle raising has dominated the local economy, but plant cultivation is also important. The principal crops are rice, yams, sorghum, and tobacco. The state lies mainly in the Llanos (plains), with no elevation above 700 feet (210 metres). Drained by secondary tributaries of the Orinoco River, Cojedes has a tropical climate with extremes of wetness and dryness, which brings hardship to the cattlemen, who must contend with hazards of flooding as well as drought. About 50 inches (1,270 mm) of rain fall during the rainy season (May to September or October). San Carlos, the state capital, and Tinaquillo are the principal market centres. Area 5,714 square miles (14,800 square km). Pop. (2001) 253,105; (2011) 323,165.
