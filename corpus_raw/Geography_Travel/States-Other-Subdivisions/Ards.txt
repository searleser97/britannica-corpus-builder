Ards, Irish An Aird,  former district (1973–2015) within the former County Down, now in the Ards and North Down district, eastern Northern Ireland. The former district extended northward from just south of the village of Killinchy along the western shoreline of Strangford Lough (inlet of the sea) to the town of Newtownards and encompassed the peninsula of land east of Strangford Lough. Bordered by the former districts of North Down and Castlereagh to the northwest and the former district of Down to the southwest, Ards was composed of relatively dry rolling lowlands in the west. The peninsula is characterized by clusters of drumlins (oval mounds of glacial till). Newtownards, settled about 1608 by Scots of the Montgomery clan at the site of a Dominican friary (now in ruins), was the district’s administrative seat and manufacturing centre with textile, metal, and engineering industries. Much of the land is devoted to crops (potatoes and barley) and pastureland. Donaghadee, at the northeastern end of the peninsula, is a popular resort town, and bird sanctuaries are found along the lough-side. Roads extending throughout the former district merge with a national highway at Newtownards, then run westward to Belfast. Area former district, 139 square miles (361 square km).
