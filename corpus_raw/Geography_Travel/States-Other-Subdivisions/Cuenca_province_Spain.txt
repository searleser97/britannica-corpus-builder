Cuenca,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Castile–La Mancha, east-central Spain, formed in 1833 from part of the ancient region of New Castile; it lies on the southern Meseta Central (plateau). The population density is low because of the large area of mountainous terrain; much of the land is uncultivated. The Serranía de Cuenca, a region of great mountain blocks, pine forests, and pastures, occupies the eastern and central parts of the province. The Júcar and Tagus rivers run through deep valleys in an eroded limestone zone, called Ciudad Encantada (“Enchanted City”), a fantastic formation of rocks resembling a city, near Cuenca, the provincial capital.
The undulating hills of the Alcarria, a semiarid region receiving less than 20 inches (500 mm) of rain per year, lie to the north; to the south the plain of La Mancha begins. Westward lies the Sierra de Altomira. Agriculture (barley and to a lesser extent olives, mushrooms, sunflowers, saffron, and fruit) and viticulture predominate in Cuenca, but the main natural source of wealth is timber (pine), used for casks, carpentry, and construction work. Sheep and goats are grazed. Honey, beeswax, goat cheese, and wool are exported. Area 6,618 square miles (17,141 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 211,375.
