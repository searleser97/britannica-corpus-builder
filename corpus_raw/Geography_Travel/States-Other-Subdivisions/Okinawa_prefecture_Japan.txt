Okinawa,  ken (prefecture), Japan, in the Pacific Ocean. The prefecture is composed of roughly the southwestern two-thirds of the Ryukyu Islands, that archipelago forming the division between the East China Sea to the northwest and the Philippine Sea to the southeast. Okinawa Island is the largest in the Ryukyus, being about 70 miles (112 km) long and 7 miles (11 km) wide and having an area of 463 square miles (1,199 square km). Naha, on the island, is the prefectural capital.
Before Okinawa became a prefecture during the early part of the Meiji period (1868–1912), it was a semi-independent kingdom under the influence of both Japan and China. Tuna fishing, cattle raising, sugar refining, and pineapple canning constitute Okinawa’s main economic activities, and tourism is of growing importance. Sweet potatoes, rice, and soybeans are also grown on the island, and textiles, sake (rice wine), and lacquerware are manufactured. Offshore wells yield petroleum.
Okinawa Island was the site of one of the bloodiest campaigns in the Pacific theatre during World War II. In April 1945 U.S. troops made an amphibious landing on Okinawa, which was heavily defended by the Japanese. In the resulting three-month-long campaign, U.S. forces sustained about 12,000 dead and 36,000 wounded before they were able to establish complete control of the island. The Japanese sustained about 100,000 dead.
In 1972 the United States returned Okinawa Island to Japan, although the extensive U.S. military installations there remained operative. Area prefecture, 877 square miles (2,271 square km). Pop. (2010) 1,392,818.
