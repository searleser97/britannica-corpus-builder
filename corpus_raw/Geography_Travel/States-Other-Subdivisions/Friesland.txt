Friesland,  coastal provincie (province), northern Netherlands. Occupying the western portion of the historic region of Frisia, the province extends inland from the IJsselmeer and the North Sea (west and north) and includes four of the West Frisian Islands off the north coast. Leeuwarden, the capital, is in the north-central part of the province.
Friesland is drained by a vast system of canals, waterways, and lakes, particularly in the north and west; the principal lakes are Tjeukemeer, Slotermeer, Fluessen, and Sneekermeer. The provinceâ€™s topography rarely exceeds 50 feet (15 metres) above sea level. Friesland has the lowest population density of any province and is only a fraction of the national average. The predominantly Protestant Frisians have maintained both their own language and their own literature to a considerable degree.
The terrain in the southeast, supporting woodlands, orchards, and Frisian cattle, is sandy heathland bordered by fens; some reclamation of peat areas continues. Between fen and coast stretch almost flat clay marshlands and polders, where reclamation continues slowly, chiefly near the north coast. The last serious flooding was in 1825. These lands support potatoes, wheat, sugar beets, and pasture for the Frisian cattle. Agriculture is the basis of the provincial economy; beef and dairy products are sold in large quantities. There is some manufacturing of agricultural machinery in the province, and tourism, largely based on water sports, is an economic asset.
Leeuwarden is the only large town, and Harlingen, the only port, serves as its outlet. Other centres are Sneek, Heerenveen, Drachten, Bolsward, Franeker, and Dokkum. There is a nature reserve for seals that is located on the Frisian island of Terschelling. Area 2,217 square miles (5,741 square km). Pop. (2009 est.) 644,811.
