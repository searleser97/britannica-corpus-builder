Glarus, French Glaris,  canton, east-central Switzerland, comprising the deep, level upper valley of the Linth River, which rises in the southwest in the glaciers of the Tödi (11,857 feet [3,614 metres]), highest of the Glarus Alps, and flows north and northeast to the Walensee (lake). About 190 square miles of its area are classed as productive, including more than 50 square miles of forest. The Linth Valley is almost completely surrounded by high mountains, rising to 10,361 feet (3,158 metres) at the Hausstock and 9,560 feet (2,914 metres) at the Glärnisch.
The Linth Valley inhabitants are said to have been converted to Christianity in the 6th century by the Irish monk St. Fridolin, founder of the Benedictine convent of Säckingen on the Rhine, east of Basel. From about the 9th century, the district was owned by the convent, over which the Habsburgs gradually claimed all rights by 1288, leading Glarus to join the Swiss Confederation in 1352. The reformer Huldrych Zwingli was priest in Glarus from 1506 until 1516, and it early adopted the Reformation, but the Zwinglians were eliminated by 1564.
There were many struggles between Protestants and Catholics, and to secure peace it was arranged that, besides the common Landsgemeinde (democratic open-air assembly), each party should have its separate Landsgemeinde (1623) and tribunals (1683). After being part of Linth canton (1798–1803), the old government was restored in 1814. In 1836 a new constitution retained only one Landsgemeinde. Under the present cantonal constitution of 1887 (revised 1988), the original open-air assembly still meets annually.
In the 18th century Glarus’s traditional woollen spinning industry was augmented by the introduction of cotton spinning and cotton printing. Other industries include slateworks (since the 17th century), hydroelectric plants, and metal and machinery factories. Cattle breeding and dairying are important on the mountain pastures. The canton is served by a railway line running north to south, past Glarus the capital, to Linthal village, and by a line from Schwanden to Elm. The population is mainly German speaking, with a small Protestant majority. Area 264 square miles (685 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 38,084.
