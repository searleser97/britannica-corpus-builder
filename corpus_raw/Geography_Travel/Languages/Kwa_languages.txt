Kwa languages,  a branch of the Niger-Congo language family consisting of 45 languages spoken by approximately 20 million people in the southern areas of Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, and Benin and in the extreme southwestern corner of Nigeria.
The Kwa languages are divided into two groups. The larger Nyo group comprises 35 languages situated in southern Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. It includes the Akan language cluster (more than eight million speakers); the Anyi and Baule languages (almost three million speakers), mostly in Côte d’Ivoire; and the Guang language cluster (about half a million speakers), mostly in Ghana.
The remaining 10 Kwa languages are termed “left bank” because they are spoken to the east of the Volta River. Of these languages the Gbe cluster (of which Ewe is the best-known member) is by far the largest, with some eight million speakers.
Kwa languages are marked by a vowel harmony system, which contrasts sets of vowels in which the tongue root is either advanced or retracted. Many Kwa languages are also characterized with a two-level tonal system in which high tones are down-stepped after low tones. Another interesting feature of Kwa languages is the fortis/lenis distinction—i.e., the contrast between the degree of pressure with which sounds are articulated.
