Grantha alphabet,   writing system of southern India developed in the 5th century ad and still in use. The earliest inscriptions in Grantha, dating from the 5th–6th century ad, are on copper plates from the kingdom of the Pallavas (near modern Madras). The form of the alphabet used in these inscriptions, classified as Early Grantha, is seen primarily on copper plates and stone monuments. Middle Grantha, the form of the script used from the mid-7th to the end of the 8th century, is also known from inscriptions on copper and stone. The script used from the 9th to the 14th century is called Transitional Grantha; from about 1300 on, the modern script has been in use. Currently two varieties are used: Brahmanic, or “square,” and Jain, or “round.” The Tulu-Malayalam script is a variety of Grantha dating from the 8th or 9th century ad. The modern Tamil script may also be derived from Grantha, but this is not certain.
Originally used for writing Sanskrit only, Grantha in its later varieties is also used to write a number of the Dravidian languages indigenous to southern India. The script has 35 letters, five of them vowels, and is written from left to right.
