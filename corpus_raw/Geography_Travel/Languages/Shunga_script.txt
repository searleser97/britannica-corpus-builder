Shunga script,  Brahmi script of North India that is associated with the Shunga dynasty (c. 185â€“73 bce). It may be connected with the scripts used in the late Mauryan empire as well as with early Kalinga characters. The Shunga script was one of three prototypes of the North Indian subdivision of Brahmi script, out of which the Gupta scripts rose.
