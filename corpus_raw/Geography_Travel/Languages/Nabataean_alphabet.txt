Nabataean alphabet,   writing system used between approximately 150 bc and ad 150 in the Nabataean kingdom of Petra in the Arabian Peninsula. Used by the Nabataeans to write the Aramaic language, this alphabet was related to the Aramaic alphabet, one of the major Semitic scripts. The Nabataean script gave rise to the neo-Sinaitic alphabet, the ancestor of the Arabic alphabet. Like its Semitic precursors, Nabataean had 22 letters, all representing consonants, and was written from right to left. Nabataean inscriptions have been found in Egypt and Italy and on coins from Petra. A bilingual inscription in Nabataean and Greek scripts was discovered on the Aegean island of Kos.
