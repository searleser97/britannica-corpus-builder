Denotation,  a name is said to denote that thing or those things of which it is a name. The threatened circularity of this definition (the two italicized words are not easily defined except by means of one another) suggests that denotation is a basic concept, for which an axiomatic treatment may be more appropriate than definition. For a fixed formalized language, a definition of denotation of names in that language is possible, although there is no definition available for denotation in general except by semantical terms, such as connotation, that are closely related to it.
