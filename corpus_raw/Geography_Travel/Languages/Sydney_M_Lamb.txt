Sydney M. Lamb, in full Sydney MacDonald Lamb,  (born May 4, 1929, Denver, Colo., U.S.), American linguist and originator of stratificational grammar, an outgrowth of glossematics theory. (Glossematics theory is based on glossemes, the smallest meaningful units of a language.)
Lamb obtained his Ph.D. in 1958 from the University of California, Berkeley. He taught at the same institution from 1956 to 1964, directing the Machine Translation Project from 1958 to 1964. He began teaching at Yale University in 1964. In 1977 he joined the staff of Semionics Associates in Berkeley, Calif. In 1981 he was appointed professor of linguistics and semiotics at Rice University in Houston, where he became Agnes Cullen Arnold Professor of Linguistics in 1983 and professor of cognitive sciences in 1996. He was named professor emeritus at Rice in 1998.
Lamb’s dissertation and early publications were studies of North American Indian languages. His seminal work, Outline of Stratificational Grammar (1966), describes four necessary levels of sentence analysis: the sememic, the lexemic, the morphemic, and the phonemic. These levels are hierarchically related, each “realized” by the elements in the level structurally beneath it. He considerably developed this theory in two later works, Pathways of the Brain: The Neurocognitive Basis of Language (1999), and (with Jonathan Webster) Language and Reality (2004).
