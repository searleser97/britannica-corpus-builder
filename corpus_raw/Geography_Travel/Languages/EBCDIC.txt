EBCDIC, in full extended binary-coded decimal interchange code,  data-encoding system, developed by IBM and used mostly on its computers, that uses a unique eight-bit binary code for each number and alphabetic character as well as punctuation marks and accented letters and nonalphabetic characters. EBCDIC differs in several respects from Unicode and ASCII, the most widely used systems of encoding text, dividing the eight bits for each character into two four-bit zones, with one zone indicating the type of character, digit, punctuation mark, lowercase letter, capital letter, and so on, and the other zone indicating the valueâ€”that is, the specific character within this type.
