Glottal stop,   in phonetics, a momentary check on the airstream caused by closing the glottis (the space between the vocal cords) and thereby stopping the vibration of the vocal cords. Upon release, there is a slight choke, or coughlike explosive sound. The glottal stop is not a separate phoneme (or distinctive sound) in English, though it is one of the allophones of the t phoneme in some dialects (as in Cockney or Brooklynese “bo’l” for “bottle”). It functions as a phoneme in numerous other languages, however, such as Arabic and many American Indian languages. The process of momentary partial or complete closure of the glottis is known as glottalization. The closure may occur slightly before the primary articulation, simultaneously with it, or slightly after it. Several African and American Indian languages have glottalized stops and sibilants, and many languages also have glottalized vowels.
