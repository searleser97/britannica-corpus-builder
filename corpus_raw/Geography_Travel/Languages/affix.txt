Affix,  a grammatical element that is combined with a word, stem, or phrase to produce derived or inflected forms. There are three main types of affixes: prefixes, infixes, and suffixes. A prefix occurs at the beginning of a word or stem (sub-mit, pre-determine, un-willing); a suffix at the end (wonder-ful, depend-ent, act-ion); and an infix occurs in the middle. English has no infixes, but they are found in American Indian languages, Greek, Tagalog, and elsewhere. An example from Tagalog is the alteration of the form sulat, “a writing,” to the form sinulat, “that which was written,” through the addition of an infix, -in-. English inflectional suffixes are illustrated by the -s of “cats,” the -er of “longer,” and the -ed of “asked.” A circumfix consists of a prefix and a suffix that together produce a derived or inflected form, as in the English word enlighten.
