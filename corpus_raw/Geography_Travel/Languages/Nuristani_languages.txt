Nuristani languages,  group of six languages and several dialects that form a subset of the Indo-Aryan subdivision of the Indo-Iranian group of Indo-European languages. Nuristani languages are spoken by more than 100,000 people, predominantly in Afghanistan.
These languages were formerly labeled Kafiri, a designation now considered offensive. They were once thought to have been members of the Dardic language group. In the mid-20th century, however, the Norwegian linguist Georg Morgenstierne discovered several linguistic characteristics and archaisms in the Nuristani group that suggested its very early separation from other branches of Indo-Iranian.
The Nuristani group includes six languages—Kati, Kamviri, Prasuni, Waigali, Tregami, and Ashkun—each of which has several dialects. There is no written literary tradition associated with any of these languages.
