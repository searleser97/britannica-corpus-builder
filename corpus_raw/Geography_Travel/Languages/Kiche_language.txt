K’iche’ language, formerly spelled Quiché,  member of the K’ichean (Quichean) subgroup of the Mayan family of languages, spoken in the western highlands of central Guatemala by nearly one million people. It is most closely related to Kaqchikel, Tz’utujil, Sakapulteko (Sacapultec), and Sipakapense (Sipacapeño) languages of central Guatemala and more distantly related to Poqomchi’, Poqomam, Uspanteko, Q’eqchi’, and other languages of the Eastern Mayan (K’ichean-Mamean) group. Achi’ is officially recognized as a separate language and is usually considered by linguists to be a dialect of K’iche’.
The major ancient literary work in K’iche’ is the Popol Vuh (“Book of Counsel”), a historical chronicle of the K’iche’ people and their kings and heroes. It was written before 1701, perhaps considerably before, based on pre-Columbian sources. Other important preconquest works include three other histories, like the Popol Vuh, written down in the 16th century in a Spanish orthography, and the Rabinal Achí, a Maya drama first discovered in the 19th century.
