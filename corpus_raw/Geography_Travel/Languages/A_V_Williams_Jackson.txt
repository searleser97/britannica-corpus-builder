A.V. Williams Jackson, in full Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson,  (born Feb. 9, 1862, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Aug. 8, 1937, New York), American scholar of the Indo-Iranian languages whose grammar of Avestan, the language of the sacred literature of Zoroastrianism, and Avesta Reader (1893) have served generations of students.
Jackson became an instructor at Columbia University soon after receiving his Ph.D. (1886). During a leave of absence in Europe, he continued to study Sanskrit, Prākrit, and Avestan, producing his noted work An Avesta Grammar in Comparison with Sanskrit (1892).
In 1895 Jackson began his 40 years as professor of Indo-Iranian languages at Columbia, where he became known as an authority on Iranian religion with the publication of Zoroaster, the Prophet of Ancient Iran (1899). In the course of four trips to India and Iran (1901–10), he scaled the cliff at Bīsitūn, Iran, to read and, for the first time (1903), to photograph the famed trilingual inscription of Darius I. His accounts of these travels, Persia Past and Present (1906) and From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam (1911), combine popular description and scholarly observation.
