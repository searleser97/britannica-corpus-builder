Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu,   (born Feb. 26, 1838, Cristineşti, Bessarabia, Russian Empire [now in Ukraine]—died  Aug. 25, 1907, Câmpina, Rom.), scholar and archivist who was a pioneer in Romanian language and historical studies.
After studies at the University of Kharkov, Hasdeu settled as a high school teacher and librarian at Iaşi (1858), where he collected and published a great number of ancient Slavic and Romanian documents for the first time in Arhiva istorică a României, 4 vol. (1865–67; “The Historical Archive of Romania”). In 1870 he founded an important review of Romanian studies and in 1875 published a work that, though incomplete, marked the beginning of critical investigation of Romanian history. He became director of the state archives in 1876 and was appointed professor of philology at the University of Bucharest in 1878. His Cuvente den Bătrâni, 2 vol. (1878–81; “Words of the Ancestors”), was the first history of apocryphal literature in Romania. In 1881 he edited a notable 16th-century Slavo-Romanian religious work, the Psalter of Coresi. He also began preparing an encyclopaedic dictionary of the Romanian language but did not get beyond the letter B.
