Ibn Durayd, in full Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan al-Azdī ibn Durayd,  (born 837/838, Basra, Iraq—died  Aug. 13, 933, Baghdad), Arab philologist who wrote a large Arabic dictionary, Jamharat al-lughah (“Collection of Language”).
Ibn Durayd traced his descent to an Arab tribe of Oman, and in 871, to avoid the Zanj (black African) slave rebellion, during which Basra was sacked, he moved to Oman. He stayed there more than a decade. After returning to Basra and later living in Fārs (southwestern Iran), Ibn Durayd settled in Baghdad in 920. He was given a pension there by the ʿAbbāsid caliph al-Muqtadir. The anthologist Abū al-Faraj al-Iṣbahānī was his student at this time.
Ibn Durayd’s dictionary was written in Fārs and was inspired in part by the earlier dictionary Kitāb al-ʿayn of the grammarian al-Khalīl. Words are listed alphabetically in Jamharat al-lughah, but all permutations of the root letters are given together. Among Ibn Durayd’s other works are Kitāb al-ishtiqāq (“Book of Derivation”), on the etymology of Arab names, and al-Malāḥin (“Ambiguities of Speech”), a book of ambivalent words for the use of persons forced to swear. Ibn Durayd was also a gifted poet.
