Biagio Marin,  (born June 29, 1891, Grado, Venice, Italy—died  Dec. 24, 1985, Grado),  Italian poet noted for writing with clarity and simplicity in the unique Venetian dialect spoken on Grado.
Marin spent his earliest years on Grado, an island in the Lagoon of Venice. He later attended the University of Vienna (1912–14) and was drafted into the Austrian army during World War I; stationed in Yugoslavia, he deserted and then fought on the Italian side. After receiving a degree in philosophy from the University of Rome, he taught high school, directed a Grado tourist agency, and served as a librarian in Trieste. He returned in 1968 to Grado, where he spent the rest of his life.
In an era of experimental poetry, Marin wrote simple poems using traditional forms. He also consistently used the Grado dialect, which he adapted somewhat by the use of archaisms and neologisms. His first poetry collection, Fiuri de tapo (1912; “Flowers of Cork”), introduced his characteristic subjects, including the sea, the wind, and the rhythms of life in an Italian island village. Love of his fellows and of God are also recurring themes, and Marin’s expressions extend to tragedy as well as to celebration. His poetry collections include I canti de l’isola (1951; revised and enlarged, 1970, 1981; “Songs of the Island”), L’estadela de San Martin (1958; “The Summer of St. Martin”), Quanto più moro (1969; “The More I Die”), and Poesie (1972; enlarged ed., 1981; “Poems”).
