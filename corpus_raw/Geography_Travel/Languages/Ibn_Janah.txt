Ibn Janāḥ, also called Ibn Jonah, Abu Al-walīd Marwān, bynames Rabbi Jonah and Rabbi Marinus,  (born c. 990, Córdoba—died c. 1050, Zaragoza, Spain), perhaps the most important medieval Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer. Known as the founder of the study of Hebrew syntax, he established the rules of biblical exegesis and clarified many difficult passages.
Trained as a physician, Ibn Janāh practiced medicine, but, out of profound religious conviction, he also devoted much time to the scientific investigation of Hebrew so as to place biblical exegesis on a firm linguistic basis. His first work, al-Mustalha (“The Complement”), like his other works, was written in Arabic. It was a criticism of and a supplement to the verb studies of Judah ben David Ḥayyuj, the founder of scientific Hebrew grammar.
The critical aspect of Ibn Janāḥ’s study embroiled him in a long and bitter dispute with the partisans of Ḥayyuj. Though his polemics against them have been lost, their substance has been preserved in his principal work, Kitāb at-tanqiḥ (“Book of Exact Investigation”). In the first of its two parts, Kitāb al-luma (“Book of the Many-Coloured Flower Beds”), Ibn Janāḥ dealt in large measure with grammar proper and included discussions of parts of speech and prefixes and provided a detailed outline of noun declensions. Particularly important was the section on syntax, which has scarcely been surpassed.
The second part of the Tanqiḥ, Kiṭāb al-uṣūl (“Book of the Roots”), is a Hebrew lexicon in which Ibn Janāḥ showed the nuances of word roots and illustrated them with examples. He made extensive comparisons of Hebrew and Arabic and thereby managed to clarify the meaning of many words. His comments facilitated the exegesis of many abstruse biblical passages, and the origin of various corrections by modern textual critics can be found in his work.
