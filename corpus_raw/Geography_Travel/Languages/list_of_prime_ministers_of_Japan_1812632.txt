 The office of prime minister of Japan was established in the 1880s during the Meiji Restoration. Originally chosen and appointed by the emperor (with the recommendation of advisers), since the constitution of 1947 the prime minister has been designated by the Diet (Kokkai) before being formally appointed by the emperor. This is a chronologically ordered list of the prime ministers, from the earliest to the most recent.
