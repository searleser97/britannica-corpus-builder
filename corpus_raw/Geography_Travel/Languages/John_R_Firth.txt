John R. Firth, in full John Rupert Firth,  (born June 17, 1890, Keighley, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  Dec. 14, 1960, Lindfield, Sussex), British linguist specializing in contextual theories of meaning and prosodic analysis. He was the originator of the “London school of linguistics.”
After receiving an M.A. in history from the University of Leeds (1913), Firth joined the Indian Education Service in 1915 and served intermittently until 1928. From 1916 to 1919 he also saw military service in Afghanistan, Africa, and India and, from 1919 to 1928, was professor of English at the University of the Punjab at Lahore. In 1928 Firth became a senior lecturer in phonetics at University College, London. He held teaching positions at the London School of Economics and at the Indian Institute, Oxford; in 1944 he was appointed to the first chair of general linguistics in Britain at the University of London, where he taught until his retirement in 1956. Beginning in 1941, Firth gave intensive courses in Japanese to military personnel, for which he was awarded the Order of the British Empire (1946). Apart from popular books on linguistics, Firth published comparatively little during his lifetime. A collection of his most important articles, Papers in Linguistics 1934–1951, appeared in 1957.
