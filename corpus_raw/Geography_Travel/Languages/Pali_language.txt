Pāli language,  classical and liturgical language of the Theravāda Buddhist canon, a Middle Indo-Aryan language of north Indian origin. On the whole, Pāli seems closely related to the Old Indo-Aryan Vedic and Sanskrit dialects but is apparently not directly descended from either of these.
Pāli’s use as a Buddhist canonical language came about because the Buddha opposed the use of Sanskrit, a learned language, as a vehicle for his teachings and encouraged his followers to use vernacular dialects. In time, his orally transmitted sayings spread through India to Sri Lanka (c. 3rd century bce), where they were written down in Pāli (1st century bce), a literary language of rather mixed vernacular origins. Pāli eventually became a revered, standard, and international tongue. The language and the Theravāda canon known as Tipiṭaka (Sanskrit: Tripiṭaka) were introduced to Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Pāli died out as a literary language in mainland India in the 14th century but survived elsewhere until the 18th.
