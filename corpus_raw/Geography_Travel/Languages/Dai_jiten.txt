Dai jiten,   (Japanese: “Great Dictionary”), dictionary of the Japanese language published in 13 illustrated volumes in Tokyo (1953–54).
The work is a reduced-size reprint of the 26-volume edition of 1934–36, augmented substantially with new entries. Dai jiten contains more than 400,000 modern, classical, dialect, and technical words, many of them, especially in the technical and modern categories, of foreign origin. Also included are 300,000 biographical and geographic names, literary titles, etc., and some illustrations.
The set also contains an introduction to grammar, as well as indexes of Kanji (Chinese characters used in writing Japanese) arranged by stroke count. There are appendixes for difficult pronunciations and for foreign biographical and geographic names.
