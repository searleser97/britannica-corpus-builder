Phoenician language,  a Semitic language of the Northern Central (often called Northwestern) group, spoken in ancient times on the coast of Syria and Palestine in Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, and neighbouring towns and in other areas of the Mediterranean colonized by Phoenicians. Phoenician is very close to Hebrew and Moabite, with which it forms the Canaanite subgroup of the Northern Central Semitic languages. The earliest Phoenician inscription probably dates from the 11th century bce; the latest inscription from Phoenicia proper is from the 1st century bce, when the language was already being superseded by Aramaic.
In addition to being used in Phoenicia, the language spread to many of its colonies. In one, the North African city of Carthage, a later stage of the language, known as Punic, became the language of the Carthaginian empire. Punic was influenced throughout its history by the Amazigh language and continued to be used by North African peasants until the 6th century ce.
Phoenician words are found in Classical Greek and Latin literature as well as in writings in the Egyptian, Akkadian, and Hebrew languages. The language is written with a 22-character alphabet that does not indicate vowels. The Phoenician writing system survived in the tifinagh script of the Tuareg, who live in the southern Sahara.
