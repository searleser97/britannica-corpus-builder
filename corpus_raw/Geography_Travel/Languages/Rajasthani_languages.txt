Rājasthānī languages,   group of Indo-Aryan languages and dialects spoken in the state of Rājasthān, India, and adjoining areas. There are four major groups: northeastern Mewātī, southern Mālvī, western Māṛwāṛī, and east-central Jaipurī.
Māṛwāṛī is the most extensive geographically. Rājasthān is a transition area between the Hindi areas on the east and the Gujarātī areas on the southwest; and Rājasthānī languages are not recognized as official media in the constitution of India. Instead, Hindi is used as the official language.
