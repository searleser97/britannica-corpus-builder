Velarization,   in phonetics, secondary articulation in the pronunciation of consonants, in which the tongue is drawn far up and back in the mouth (toward the velum, or soft palate), as if to pronounce a back vowel such as o or u. Velarization is not phonemic in English, although for most English speakers the l in “feel” is velarized, but the l in “leaf” is not. It is distinctive in some languages (e.g., Arabic). Velarized consonants may be distinguished from velar consonants, in which the primary articulation involves the back of the tongue and the velum; in velarized consonants there must always be some other primary articulation.
