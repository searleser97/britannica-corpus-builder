Papiamentu, also spelled Papiamento,  creole language based on Portuguese but heavily influenced by Spanish. In the early 21st century, it was spoken by about 250,000 people, primarily on the Caribbean islands of Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire. It is an official language of Curaçao and Aruba.
Papiamentu developed in Curaçao after the Netherlands took over the island from Spain in 1634. In 1659, having been expelled from Brazil, several Portuguese-speaking Dutch colonists and their Sephardic Jewish allies immigrated to Curaçao. They took with them not only their slaves but also a Portuguese vernacular. If this vernacular did not yet qualify as a creole, it would within the following decades, after being appropriated and modified by the African slaves who were continually being imported to the island, which was used as a slave-trading centre or “slave depot.” Increased contacts with Spanish-speaking slave buyers from mainland South America introduced a Spanish element into the then-developing Papiamentu. During the 18th century the creole apparently spread to Curaçao’s sister islands of Aruba and Bonaire.
Because of structural similarities between Portuguese and Spanish that make it difficult to distinguish their respective influences, Papiamentu is often identified simply as an Iberian creole. It is one of the rare Atlantic creoles that clearly use tones for lexical (vocabulary) and grammatical contrasts, as in pápà ‘pope’ versus pàpá ‘dad’ or biáhà ‘travel’ (noun) versus biàhá ‘to travel,’ in which the acute accent represents the high tone and the grave accent the low tone. Papiamentu is also one of the few Caribbean creoles that have been well integrated into the elementary and secondary school systems and mass media as well as the political life of the islands.
