Ethio-Semitic languages,  the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea, including Geʿez, the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox church; Amharic, one of the principal languages of modern Ethiopia; Tigré, of northwestern Eritrea and Sudan; Tigrinya, or Tigrai, of northern Ethiopia and central Eritrea; Argobba; Hareri; and Gurage. Although some scholars once considered the so-called Ethiopic languages to be a branch within Semitic, these languages are now referred to as Ethio-Semitic. They are generally grouped together with the dialects of the South Arabic language as Southern Peripheral Semitic or South Arabic-Ethiopic.
