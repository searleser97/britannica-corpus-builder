Object language,   in semantics and logic, the ordinary language used to talk about things or objects in the worldâ€”as contrasted with metalanguage, an artificial language used by linguists and others to analyze or describe the sentences or elements of object language itself. The concept was developed by such 20th-century logical positivists as Polish-American Alfred Tarski and German-American Rudolf Carnap.
