al-Mubarrad, original name Abū Al-ʿabbās Muḥammad Ibn Yazīd,  (born March 25, 826, Basra, Iraq—died  October 898, Baghdad), Arab grammarian and literary scholar whose Al-Kāmil (“The Perfect One”) is a storehouse of linguistic knowledge.
After studying grammar in Basra, al-Mubarrad was called to the court of the ʿAbbāsid caliph al-Mutawakkil at Sāmarrāʾ in 860. When the caliph was killed in 861, al-Mubarrad went to Baghdad, remaining there most of his life as a teacher. In Al-Kāmil, al-Mubarrad gives excerpts from Arab poetry and proverbs and from Arab history and the Ḥadīth (traditions of the prophet Muḥammad) and subjects them to grammatical and literary scrutiny.
