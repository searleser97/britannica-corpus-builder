Subtitle,  a secondary or explanatory title. Such titles can explain the form of the work, as in Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Remorse: A Tragedy, in Five Acts; they can give an idea of the theme or contents of the book, as in George Eliot’s Middlemarch: A Study of Provincial Life; or they can simply be an alternate title, which may or may not be a comment on the work, such as Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded by Samuel Richardson and Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley.
