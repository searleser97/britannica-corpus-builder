Josef Dobrovský,  (born August 17, 1753, Gyarmat, Hungary—died January 6, 1829, Brno, Moravia, Austrian Empire [now in Czech Republic]), scholar of the Czech language, antiquary, and a principal founder of comparative Slavic linguistics.
Educated for the Roman Catholic priesthood, Dobrovský devoted himself to scholarship after the temporary dissolution of the Jesuit order in 1773. He was tireless in his research on ancient Slavic manuscripts, and he traveled widely, notably to Russia and Sweden in 1792, in search of works removed during the Thirty Years’ War. His textual criticism of the Bible led him to study Old Church Slavonic and, subsequently, the Slavic languages as a group. His erudition ultimately extended to all fields of Slavic literature, language, history, and antiquities.
The first of his three most important works was Geschichte der böhmischen Sprache und Literatur (1792; “History of the Bohemian Language and Literature”), which included considerations of many earlier works long suppressed because of their Protestant religious content. His grammar of Czech, Lehrgebäude der böhmischen Sprache (1809; “Learning System of the Bohemian Language”), codified the language and brought order to the usage of the literary language that had come to be neglected in the preceding 150 years. The foundation of comparative Slavic studies was laid in Dobrovský’s grammar of Old Church Slavonic (1815).
