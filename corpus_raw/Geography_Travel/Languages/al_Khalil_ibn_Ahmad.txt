Al-Khalīl ibn Aḥmad, in full Abū ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Khalīl ibn Aḥmad al-Farāhīdī al-Azdī,  (born c. 718, Oman—died c. 791, Basra, Iraq), Arab philologist who compiled the first Arabic dictionary and is credited with the formulation of the rules of Arabic prosody.
When he moved to Basra, al-Khalīl left the Ṣufriyyah division of the Khārijites, which was popular in his native Oman. He lived simply and piously in Basra, where he taught. The renowned grammarians Sībawayh and al-Aṣmaʾī were among his students. Khalīl’s dictionary, Kitāb al-ʿayn (“Book of the [Letter] ʿAyn”), may have been written in part by his student al-Layth ibn al-Muẓaffar of Khorāsān, who was at one time secretary to the Barmakid viziers of the ʿAbbāsid court. It is arranged according to a novel alphabetical order based on a letter’s place of articulation in the mouth, beginning with the letter ʿayn. His sample verses from his work on poetry, Kitāb al-ʿarūḍ (“Book of Prosody”), are known, although his book is lost.
