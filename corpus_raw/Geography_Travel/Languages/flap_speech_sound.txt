Flap,   in phonetics, a consonant sound produced by a single quick flip of the tongue against the upper part of the mouth, often heard as a short r in Spanish (e.g., in pero, “but”) and similar to the pronunciation of the sound represented by the double letter in American English “Betty” and some forms of British English “berry.”
