Position,  in Greek or Latin prosody, the condition of having a short vowel followed by two consonants or a double consonant (such as -pp- in the Greek word hippos), which makes its syllable long. Such a syllable is said to be long by position, in contrast to a syllable having a long vowel or a diphthong, which is said to be long by nature.
