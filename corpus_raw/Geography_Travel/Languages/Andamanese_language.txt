Andamanese language,   language spoken by the indigenous people of the Andaman Islands. The number of speakers of the language has been steadily decreasing. Andamanese dialects are usually classified into northern, central, and southern groups, with the southern dialects being the most archaic. The dialect of Little Andaman island is the southernmost of the Andamanese dialects and diverges greatly from the others.
One of the chief characteristics of Andamanese grammar is the use of affixes (especially prefixes) to specify the functions of the words of a sentence. The language has no number system; the two number words in the language mean “one” and “more than one.”
Andamanese is not known to be related to any other language.
