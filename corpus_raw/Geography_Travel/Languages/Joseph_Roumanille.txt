Joseph Roumanille,  (born Aug. 8, 1818, Saint-Remy-de-Provence, France—died May 24, 1891, Avignon), Provençal poet and teacher, a founder and leader of the Félibrige, a movement dedicated to the restoration and maintenance of Provençal language, literature, and customs. Félibrige stimulated the renaissance of the language and customs of the whole of southern France.
While teaching at the Collège Royal of Avignon (later renamed the Lycée Frédéric Mistral), Roumanille became a lifelong friend of Frédéric Mistral, who was to be the preeminent figure in the Provençal renaissance.
Roumanille was both a writer and a scholar of Provençal. His standardization of the orthography of the Provençal language, which he set forth in the introduction to his play La Part dou bon Dieu (1853), is considered the first attempt to regularize spelling and usage in the language. Working with Frédéric Mistral, Roumanille then began standardizing Provençal grammar. In 1854 the two, together with five other Provençal poets, founded Félibrige. The following year they established the annual Armana Prouvençau (“Provençal Almanac”). Roumanille also wrote many works of poetry and prose in Provençal, including the poems of Li Margarideto (1847; “The Daisies”) and Li Flour de Sauvi (1859; “The Sage Flowers”).
