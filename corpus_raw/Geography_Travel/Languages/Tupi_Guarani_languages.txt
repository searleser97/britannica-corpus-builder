Tupí-Guaraní languages,   one of the most widespread groups of South American Indian languages (after Arawakan). It is divided by some scholars into two major divisions: Tupí in eastern Brazil and Guaraní in Paraguay and Argentina. These languages were used by the first European traders and missionaries as contact languages in their dealings with the Indians. Guaraní became the national language of Paraguay, although not with official status; persons not speaking Guaraní are in a minority in that country. The language is also a literary language for works of a popular character, especially for songs. Some scholars classify Tupí-Guaraní with a number of other less important groups in a Tupian grouping.
