Nonce word,  a word coined and used apparently to suit one particular occasion. Nonce words are sometimes used independently by different writers and speakers, but they are not adopted into general use. Literary works known for their prominent use of nonce words include Lewis Carroll’s poem “Jabberwocky” (1871) and James Joyce’s novel Finnegans Wake (1939). Compare portmanteau word.
