Ethiopic alphabet,   writing system used to write the Geʿez literary and ecclesiastical language and the Amharic, Tigre, and Tigrinya languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Apparently derived from Sabaean, a South Semitic script, the Ethiopic script probably originated in the early 4th century ad; it is unclear whether Ethiopic resulted from a gradual evolution of the Sabaean script or whether it was invented deliberately by some individual who used the Sabaean script as a model. Current opinion is that the letters were derived gradually from Sabaean, while the vocalic (vowel) markings used with the letters were the work of a single individual. Inscriptions from the 4th century occur in the Geʿez language both in Sabaean and in varieties of the Ethiopic script.
The Ethiopic alphabet consists of 26 letters, all representing consonants, which may be transformed into syllabic symbols by the attachment of the appropriate vocalic markers to the letters. The 26 letters are derived from 24 of the 28 letters in Sabaean, plus added letters to represent the p sound, which did not exist in the Sabaean language. The direction of writing, unlike that of Sabaean and the other Semitic languages, is from left to right; this is probably a result of Greek influence.
