Portmanteau word, also called blend,  a word that results from blending two or more words, or parts of words, such that the portmanteau word expresses some combination of the meaning of its parts. Examples in English include chortle (from chuckle and snort), smog (from smoke and fog), brunch (from breakfast and lunch), mockumentary (from mock and documentary), and spork (from spoon and fork). A portmanteau is a suitcase that opens into halves.
Lewis Carroll was the first to use portmanteau to describe a specific type of word, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. He did so in his Through the Looking-Glass (1871), in reference to the nonsense poem “Jabberwocky,” which begins
Alice recites this stanza to Humpty Dumpty soon after she meets him and hopes that he can explain the meaning of slithy. He  replies, “Well, ‘slithy’ means ‘lithe and slimy.’ ‘Lithe’ is the same as ‘active.’ You see it’s like a portmanteau—there are two meanings packed up into one word.” Mimsy is similar, he later  explains : “Well then, ‘mimsy’ is ‘flimsy and miserable’ (there’s another portmanteau for you).”
Among writers of literature in English, James Joyce pushed the idea of the portmanteau word to a literary extreme in Finnegans Wake (1939), in which he wove together words from numerous languages and invested them with multiple meanings. Portmanteau words are common and often serve a practical purpose as shorthand for trends or phenomena that are themselves blends.
