Aleut language, Aleut Unangam Tunuu,  one of two branches of the Eskimo-Aleut languages (q.v.). Two mutually intelligible dialects survive, Eastern Aleut and Atkan Aleut. A third dialect, Attu, now extinct in Alaska, survives on Bering Island (one of the Komandor Islands) in a creolized form that incorporates Russian verbal inflections. Aleut is spoken from the Alaska Peninsula through Umnak Island and on Atka Island in the Aleutian Islands, on the Pribilof Islands north of the Aleutians, and on Bering Island.
