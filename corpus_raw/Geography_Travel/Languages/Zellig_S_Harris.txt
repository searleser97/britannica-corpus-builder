Zellig S. Harris, in full Zellig Sabbetai Harris,  (born Oct. 23, 1909, Balta, Russia—died May 22, 1992, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Russian-born American scholar known for his work in structural linguistics. He carried the structural linguistic ideas of Leonard Bloomfield to their furthest logical development: to discover the linear distributional relations of phonemes and morphemes.
Harris was taken to the United States as a child in 1913, and he received a B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. (1934) from the University of Pennsylvania, where he began teaching in 1931 and became Benjamin Franklin Professor of Linguistics in 1966.
Harris’s Methods in Structural Linguistics (1951) established his scholarly reputation as a theorist. In subsequent work on discourse analysis, Harris suggested the use of transformations as a means of expanding his method of descriptive analysis to cross sentence boundaries. Since Harris was Noam Chomsky’s teacher, some linguists have questioned whether Chomsky’s transformational grammar is as revolutionary as it has been portrayed, but the two scholars developed their ideas in different contexts and for different purposes. For Harris, a transformation relates surface structure-sentence forms and is not a device to transform a deep structure into a surface structure, as it is in transformational grammar.
