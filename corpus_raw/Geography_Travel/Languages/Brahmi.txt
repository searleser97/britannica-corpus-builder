Brāhmī,,  writing system ancestral to all Indian scripts except Kharoṣṭhī. Of Aramaic derivation or inspiration, it can be traced to the 8th or 7th century bc, when it may have been introduced to Indian merchants by people of Semitic origin. Brāhmī is semialphabetic, each consonant having either an inherent a sound pronounced after it or a diacritic mark to show another vowel; initial vowels have separate characters. In most cases Brāhmī and its derivatives are written from left to right, but a coin of the 4th century bc, discovered in Madhya Pradesh, is inscribed with Brāhmī characters running from right to left. Among the many descendants of Brāhmī are Devanāgarī (used for Sanskrit, Hindi, and other Indian languages), the Bengali and Gujarati scripts, and those of the Dravidian languages.
