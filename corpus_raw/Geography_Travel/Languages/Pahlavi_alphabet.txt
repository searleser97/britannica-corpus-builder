Pahlavi alphabet, Pahlavi also spelled Pehlevi,  writing system of the Persian people that dates from as early as the 2nd century bce, some scholars believe, and was in use until the advent of Islam (7th century ce).  The Zoroastrian sacred book, the Avesta, is written in a variant of Pahlavi called Avestan.
The Pahlavi alphabet developed from the Aramaic alphabet and occurred in at least three local varieties: northwestern, called Pahlavik, or Arsacid; southwestern, called Parsik, or Sāsānian; and eastern. All were written from right to left. Of the 22 letters in Aramaic, most came to represent more than one sound in Pahlavi; several were not used at all, and one evolved into two letters in Pahlavi. Northwestern Pahlavi had 20 letters, and southwestern had 19. Avestan, a cursive script, had 50 distinct letters and was perhaps separately invented, though patterned after Pahlavi.
A peculiarity of the Pahlavi writing system was the custom of using Aramaic words to represent Pahlavi words; these served, so to speak, as ideograms. An example is the word for “king,” in Pahlavi shāh, which was consistently written m-l-k after the Aramaic word for “king,” malka, but read as shāh. A great many such ideograms were in standard use, including all pronouns and conjunctions and many nouns and verbs, making Pahlavi quite difficult to read.
