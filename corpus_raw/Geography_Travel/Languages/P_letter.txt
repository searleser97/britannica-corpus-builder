P,  sixteenth letter of the alphabet. Throughout its known history it has represented the unvoiced labial stop. It corresponds to the Semitic pe, perhaps deriving from an earlier sign for "mouth." The Greeks renamed this form pi (Π).
A rounded form occurred in the early Greek inscriptions from the island of Thera. In the Italic alphabets the form varied strangely. The standard rounded form in the Latin alphabet was evidently borrowed from the Etruscan, but the colonial Latin alphabet of the 3rd century bce also shows an angular form resembling the Chalcidic. The Umbrian alphabet had a two-stroke form that recalled the ancient Semitic, and Faliscan had a rounded form that resembled a modern P flipped right-to-left. Oscan lengthened the second small vertical stroke found in the Umbrian form, and the result was similar to the Greek Π.
The minuscule letter resembles the majuscule, the chief difference being that the loop is brought down to the level of the line of writing and the vertical stroke is extended below the line. The English initial p is slightly aspirated—that is, it is accompanied by a slight puff of breath—in contrast to the unaspirated p of French, for example. In English, as in French and German, the letter is used in combination with h in words of Greek origin to denote the unvoiced labiodental spirant expressed in other words by the letter f—e.g., philosophy, phonetics, and graphic. Initial p is silent in the combinations ps and pt in such Greek-derived words as psychology and pterodactyl.
