Stop, also called plosive,  in phonetics, a consonant sound characterized by the momentary blocking (occlusion) of some part of the oral cavity. A completely articulated stop usually has three stages: the catch (implosion), or beginning of the blockage; the hold (occlusion); and the release (explosion), or opening of the air passage again. A stop differs from a fricative (q.v.) in that, with a stop, occlusion is total, rather than partial. Occlusion may occur at various places in the vocal tract from the glottis to the lips; stops are thus classified as to their place of articulation—glottal, velar, palatal, alveolar, dental, bilabial, etc. In English, b and p are bilabial stops, d and t are alveolar stops, g and k are velar stops. A stop for which there is no English letter is the glottal stop, which occurs in the Scottish, Cockney, and Brooklynese pronunciation of the tt in “bottle” (“bo’l”); in other tongues (e.g., Arabic) the glottal stop has a separate mark in the script.
