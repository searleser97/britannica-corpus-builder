Dunash Ben Labrat,  Labrat also spelled Librat,  also called Al-abrad, or Adonina Ha-levi,  (born c. 920, Fès, Mor.?—died c. 990, Córdoba?), Hebrew poet, grammarian, and polemicist who was the first to use Arabic metres in his verse, thus inaugurating a new mode in Hebrew poetry. His strictures on the Hebrew lexicon of Menahem ben Saruq provoked a quarrel that helped initiate a golden age in Hebrew philology.
Dunash was born either in Fès or in Baghdad and after travelling to Sura, Babylonia, studied there under a renowned master of Jewish learning, Saʿadia ben Joseph. It was in Sura that he first composed his poems in Arabic metres, an innovation that amazed Saʿadia.
After a time, Dunash migrated to Córdoba, in Moorish Spain, then experiencing a renaissance of Jewish culture under a powerful Jewish statesman and adviser to the caliph, Ḥisdai ibn Shaprut (c. 915–975?). A favourite of Ḥisdai’s, the philologist Menahem ben Saruq, had written the first true Hebrew dictionary. Dunash wrote a devastating polemic against this work that combined personal attacks on Menahem with praise for Ḥisdai. Menahem lost favour with Ḥisdai and died not long afterward. Menahem’s pupils answered with a polemic of their own, a quarrel that paved the way for a fresh examination of Hebrew grammar. Dunash also wrote an unpublished treatise on grammar in which he reveals his understanding (unusual for his time) that, although Hebrew verbs are based on three-consonant roots, in some conjugations a root letter may be dropped.
