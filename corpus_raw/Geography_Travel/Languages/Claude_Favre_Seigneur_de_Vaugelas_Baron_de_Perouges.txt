Claude Favre, seigneur de Vaugelas,  (born January 6, 1585, Meximieux, France—died February 1650, Paris), French grammarian and an original member of the Académie Française who played a major role in standardizing the French language of literature and of polite society. A courtier, he was a habitué of the salon of the Marquise de Rambouillet, where his taste and judgment in questions of speech and writing earned the respect of men of letters.
In his Remarques sur la langue françoise, utiles à ceux qui veulent bien parler et bien escrire (1647; “Remarks on the French Language, Useful for Those Who Wish to Speak Well and Write Well”), Vaugelas recorded what he considered good usage: the speech of the “soundest” elements of the court and the written language of the most intelligent authors. His contemporaries soon accepted his decisions as authoritative in cases of doubtful or conflicting usage; parler Vaugelas meant to speak not merely correctly but elegantly, and the Remarques became la bible de l’usage.
Vaugelas was sensible enough to realize that good usage changed with changes of interest in society. But when Richelieu took over his literary discussion group of nine to form the Académie Française, he instructed them to create firm rules for the language and to render it pure and eloquent. Vaugelas’ dicta were then taken too literally. The rigidity imposed by the Académie was resisted by authors in the second half of the 17th century, and, even some of Vaugelas’ contemporaries, not content with the formal language of the court, spiced their writing with language of the common people. Ultimately, however, the Académie eliminated the excesses of Renaissance diction and set a standard of literary taste.
