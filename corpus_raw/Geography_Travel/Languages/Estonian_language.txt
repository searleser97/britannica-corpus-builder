Estonian language, Estonian Eesti,  member of the Finno-Ugric branch of the Uralic language family, spoken in Estonia and in scattered pockets in surrounding regions. The language occurs in two major dialectal forms, northern and southern; the northern, or Tallinn, dialect is the basis of the Estonian literary language. The first notable written materials in Estonian are the Kullamaa prayers of the 1520s.
Estonian belongs to the Baltic-Finnic branch of the Finno-Ugric languages, and it is most closely related to Finnish, Votic, Livonian, Ingrian, Karelian, and Veps. In structure the language is best known for its unusual contrast of three degrees of consonant and vowel length—e.g., koli ‘junk’ (with short o), kooli ‘of school’ (with long o), and kooli ‘to school’ (pronounced with an extra long o although spelled the same as the preceding form). Estonian also has the characteristic Baltic-Finnic consonant gradation, in which consonants alternate in certain contexts, but it has lost the feature of vowel harmony. (Vowel harmony is said to exist when certain vowels cannot occur with other specific vowels within a word.) Estonian, like the other Uralic languages, primarily marks grammatical categories by the addition of suffixes to the stem. Much of the Estonian vocabulary has been borrowed from German.
