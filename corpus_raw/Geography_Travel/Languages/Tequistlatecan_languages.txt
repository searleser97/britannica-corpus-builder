Tequistlatecan languages, also called Chontal of Oaxaca or Oaxaca Chontal,  a small family of three closely related languages spoken in Mexico. Huamelultec (also called Lowland Chontal) is spoken today by fewer than 100 elderly persons in San Pedro Huamelula and Santiago Astata near the coast in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Tequistlatec (Tequistlatec proper) was formerly spoken in Tequisistlán, Oaxaca, but now has no speakers. Highland Chontal has about 3,000 speakers, spoken in the highlands of Oaxaca.
Tequistlatecan is often called Chontal of Oaxaca (or Oaxaca Chontal) but is not to be confused with Chontal of Tabasco, a Mayan language. The origin of these names is the Nahuatl word chontalli ‘foreigner’. Tequistlatecan has often been associated with the now mostly abandoned Hokan hypothesis, sometimes thought more closely connected with Seri and Yuman languages, though none of these hypotheses is substantiated. Evidence for a connection with Jicaquean of Honduras is suggestive but inconclusive.
