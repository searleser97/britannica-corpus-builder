Didymus Chalkenteros, Chalkenteros also spelled Chalcenterus,  (flourished c. 80–10 bc, Alexandria), Greek scholar and grammarian, one of the chief links between ancient and modern classical scholarship. His industry, as the reputed author of 3,500 books, earned him the nickname of Chalkenteros (“Brass Guts”). His output included work on the text of Homer, exegetical commentaries on numerous Greek authors, lexicographical compilations, and grammatical and antiquarian treatises.
