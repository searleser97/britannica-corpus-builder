Galician language, Galician Galego, Castilian Spanish Gallego,  Romance language with many similarities to the Portuguese language, of which it was historically a dialect. It is now much influenced by standard Castilian Spanish. Galician is spoken by some four million people as a home language, mostly in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain—where almost 90 percent of the population spoke Galician at the turn of the 21st century—but also in adjacent regions of Portugal (notably Trás-os-Montes).
In Castile, where standard Spanish (Castilian) originated, Galician was the conventional language of the courtly lyric until roughly 1400, but it lost ground in the 15th century, and Castilian replaced Galician as the official language of Galicia in 1500. Dialect poetry in Galician has flourished since the 18th century, with an upsurge in the 19th century.
