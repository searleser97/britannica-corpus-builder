Eponym,  one for whom or which something is or is believed to be named. The word can refer, for example, to the usually mythical ancestor or totem animal or object that a social group (such as a tribe) holds to be the origin of its name. In its most familiar use, eponym denotes a person for whom a place or thing is named, as in describing James Monroe as the eponym of Monrovia, Liberia. The derivative adjective is eponymous. An eponymous hero of a work of literature is one whose name is the title of the work, such as Anne Bronte’s Agnes Grey, Charles Dickens’s David Copperfield, and John Fowles’s Daniel Martin.
