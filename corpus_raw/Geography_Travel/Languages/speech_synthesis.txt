speech synthesis,  generation of speech by artificial means, usually by computer. Production of sound to simulate human speech is referred to as low-level synthesis. High-level synthesis deals with the conversion of written text or symbols into an abstract representation of the desired acoustic signal, suitable for driving a low-level synthesis system. Among other applications, this technology provides speaking aid to the speech-impaired and reading aid to the sight-impaired.
