Aspirate,   the sound h as in English “hat.” Consonant sounds such as the English voiceless stops p, t, and k at the beginning of words (e.g., “pat,” “top,” “keel”) are also aspirated because they are pronounced with an accompanying forceful expulsion of air. Such sounds are not aspirated at the end of words or in combination with certain consonants (e.g., in “spot,” “stop”). The voiced stops b and d in Sanskrit and Hindi also have aspirated forms that are usually transliterated as bh and dh.
