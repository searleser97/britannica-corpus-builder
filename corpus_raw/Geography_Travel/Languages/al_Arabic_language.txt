Al-,  Arabic definite article, meaning “the.” It often prefixes Arabic proper nouns, especially place-names; an example is Al-Jazīrah (Arabic: “The Island”), the name of an interfluvial region in Sudan. The article is often used in lowercase form, hence al-Jazīrah. Reference works, including the Encyclopædia Britannica, often alphabetize names beginning with al- under the main part of the name (thus, in the example, “Jazīrah, Al-”). Thirteen Arabic letters—the so-called sun letters, t, th, d, dh, r, z, s, sh, ṣ, ḍ, ṭ, ẓ, and n—assimilate the l of al- in pronunciation: thus, “Ash-Shām” (the colloquial Arabic name of Damascus), not “Al-Shām,” for example. (In the Encyclopædia Britannica, however, the definite article is written al- in transliteration, even when the l is assimilated in pronunciation [i.e., is not pronounced].)
Care must be taken to avoid confusing the definite article al- meaning “the” with the form Āl, a different Arabic construction that is used to designate a family or tribal name. Āl is invariate and does not elide; thus, Āl Saʿūd, not Ās-Saʿūd. The form Āl is always romanized with a capital letter, irrespective of its position in an English sentence.
