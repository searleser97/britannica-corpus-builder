Semelaic languages, also called Southern Aslian Languages,   (from Malay orang asli, “aborigines”), subbranch of the Aslian branch of the Mon-Khmer language family, which is itself a part of the Austroasiatic stock. The subbranch consists of three languages spoken in southern and central Malaysia: Betise’ (previously known as Mah Meri, or Besisi), Semelai, and Semaq Beri. Like the Senoic languages, the Semelaic languages were sometimes referred to as Sakai.
