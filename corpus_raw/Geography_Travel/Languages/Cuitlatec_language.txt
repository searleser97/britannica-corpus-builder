Cuitlatec language, also called Cuitlateco,  a language isolate (i.e., a language with no known relatives) that was spoken in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It became extinct in the 1960s with the death of Juana Can, the last known speaker. It is poorly documented, though brief descriptive materials exist.
Proposals have attempted to link Cuitlatec with several other language families or isolates—with the “Hokan” hypothesis, Mayan, Otomanguean, Paya (a member of the Chibchan family), Tarascan, Tlapanec (of the Otomanguean family), Uto-Aztecan, and Xinkan (Xincan)—but all of these hypotheses lack convincing evidence.
The name Cuitlatec is not native to the language but comes from Nahuatl cuitla- ‘excrement’ + -teca ‘-ite, inhabitant of the place of.’ It is not known why the language and its speakers were given this name.
