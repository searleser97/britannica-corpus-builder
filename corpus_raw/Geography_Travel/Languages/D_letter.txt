D,  letter that has retained the fourth place in the alphabet from the earliest point at which it appears in history. It corresponds to Semitic daleth and Greek delta (Δ). The form is thought to derive from an early pictograph, possibly Egyptian, indicating the folding door of a tent. The rounded form D occurs in the Chalcidian alphabet, whence the Latin alphabet may have acquired it by way of the Etruscans. The letter has retained the rounded form that it had in the Latin alphabet until the present day.
In Latin cursive forms of the 5th and 6th century, the right-hand rounded line of the majuscule letter was carried far above the level of its junction with the stroke. From these forms and from the uncial arose the Carolingian and our own minuscule d.
The sound consistently represented by the letter in Semitic, Greek, Latin and the modern languages of Europe is the voiced dental stop. In English this sound, as well as the unvoiced sound represented by t, has become alveolar, that is to say, is pronounced by the pressure of the tongue upon the gums rather than upon the teeth.
The etymological value of d in words of native English origin is generally the same as that of German t (th), Sanskrit dh, Greek θ, Latin f (initial) or d or b (medial), all being derived from dh in the parent Indo-European speech (e.g., English do, German thun, Sanskrit dadhāmi). In some other instances d is derived from Indo-European t when the d originally resulting from the t has been subsequently altered by the change familiarly known as Verner’s law. The occurrence of this change depended on the place of the Indo-European accent (so, for example, the prior d in hundred, Sanskrit śatám, Latin centum).
