Juan Pablo Bonet,  (born 1560, Torres de Berrellen, Spain—died 1620, Torres de Berrellen), Spanish cleric and educator who pioneered in the education of the deaf.
Bonet helped develop one of the earliest and most successful methods for educating the deaf and improving their verbal and nonverbal communication skills. Bonet’s multidimensional approach, based on the work of Pedro Ponce de León (c. 1520–84), is detailed in his Reducción de las letras y arte para enseñar a hablar a los mudos (1620; “Reduction of the Letters of the Alphabet and Method of Teaching Deaf-Mutes to Speak”). Bonet used every technique available in developing this approach. Beginning with the study of written words, Bonet taught the phonetic values of the letters, emphasizing the correct positioning of the lips and tongue needed for clear articulation. He also taught manual signs and a finger alphabet.
