Lao language, also called Laotian,  one of the Tai languages of Southeast Asia, and the official language of Laos. Lao occurs in various dialects, which differ among themselves at least as much as Lao as a group differs from the Tai dialects of northeastern Thailand. The latter are usually called Northeastern Thai, but the difference between Lao and Northeastern Thai is more political than linguistic. Like the other Tai languages, Lao is generally monosyllabic in word form and uses tones (pitch differences) to distinguish between words that are otherwise pronounced alike. Some polysyllabic Lao words do occur; for the most part, they are borrowed from PƒÅli (the language of the Buddhist scriptures, related to Sanskrit) and from Cambodian. Lao has also received influence from the neighbouring, and closely related, Standard Thai, the national language of Thailand. The language is written in a script of Indic origin, similar to that of Thai. See also Tai languages.
