Ionic alphabet,  most important variety of the eastern form of the ancient Greek alphabet, developed late in the 5th century bc. In 403 the Ionic alphabet used in the Anatolian city of Miletus was adopted for use in Athens, and by the middle of the 4th century the Ionic had become the common, 24-letter, classical Greek alphabet.
