Mon language, also called Talaing, or Peguan,  Mon-Khmer language spoken by the Mon people of southeastern Myanmar (Lower Burma) and several Mon communities in Thailand. The oldest inscriptions, dating from the 6th century, are found in central Thailand in archaeological sites associated with the Dvaravati kingdom. Numerous Old Mon inscriptions date from the later Mon kingdoms of Thaton and Pegu. The Old Mon inscriptions found at Pagan, central Myanmar, attest to the prestige of the Mon language in medieval Myanmar society. Old Mon is written in a script originating from South India. The Mon writing system evolved gradually into its modern form and served as a basis for the Burmese writing system. The modern Mon language is now spoken primarily in southeastern Myanmar, between the towns of Moulmein and Ye. In northern, central, and western Thailand, there are also numerous Mon communities that migrated from Myanmar over the past four centuries.
