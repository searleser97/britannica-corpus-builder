Hälsinge Runes,  greatly abbreviated runic alphabet, found mainly in inscriptions dating from the 10th to the 12th century in the Hälsingland region of Sweden. Probably developed near Lake Malar, the runes seem to be a simplification of the Swedish-Norwegian Rök runes and lack vertical strokes. See also Rök Stone; runic alphabet.
