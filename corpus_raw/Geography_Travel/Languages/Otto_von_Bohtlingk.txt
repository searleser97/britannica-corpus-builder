Otto von Böhtlingk,  (born June 11 [May 30, old style], 1815, St. Petersburg, Russian Empire—died April 1, 1904, Leipzig), language scholar and lexicographer whose writings and seven-volume Sanskrit–German dictionary formed a notable contribution to 19th-century linguistic study.
While completing his education at the University of Bonn (1839–42), Böhtlingk published a two-volume edition (1839–40) of the earliest known grammar, that of Pāṇini, the 5th- or 6th-century-bc Indian Sanskrit grammarian. This edition served as a vehicle for criticizing the research methods of Franz Bopp, a major German Sanskritist of the time. Returning to St. Petersburg in 1842, he joined the Imperial Academy of Sciences and published a number of works on Sanskrit, including an edition and translation of the drama Śakuntalā by Kālidāsa (1842). He also explored one of the languages of Siberia in Über die Sprache der Jakuten, 3 vol. (1851; “Concerning the Language of the Yakuts”). His great work, the Sanskrit-Wörterbuch (1853–75; “Sanskrit Dictionary”), was prepared in collaboration with the Indic scholars Rudolf von Roth, Albrecht Weber, and others and appeared in a new edition in 1879–89. Late in his life, he published, in addition to other Sanskrit research, a new edition of the Pāṇini grammar along with a translation.
