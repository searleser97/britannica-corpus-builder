B,  letter, corresponding to Semitic beth and Greek beta, that has from earliest times retained the second place in all the European alphabets except the Cyrillic. The earliest form of the letter appears on the Moabite Stone, dating from the 9th century bce. Early Greek forms gave way to intermediate Greek and Latin renditions that were virtually identical to the modern B.
The equivalent Hebrew letter is thought to derive from an earlier symbol resembling the floor plan of a house; hence, the letter was named beth, the Hebrew word for "house." The English minuscule b is a descendant of Latin cursive form, in which the upper loop is extremely elongated and has almost disappeared. The sound represented by the letter is the voiced bilabial stop. It stood for this sound in the Semitic languages and in Greek and Latin. From the 2nd century ce the sound in Latin tended to become a bilabial spirant, for there is evidence of confusion in spelling between b and v. The letter, however, did not fall into disuse and was used in the Romance languages to represent the voiced labial stop in those situations where it was preserved, including the double bb and, in many of the languages, the initial b. The sound was always present in English, where it was derived from Indo-European.
The Cyrillic alphabet was based on medieval Greek, in which the phonetic value of B had become v. A new form was therefore devised as the phonetic equivalent of b, and this letter appears in the second position of the Cyrillic alphabet.
