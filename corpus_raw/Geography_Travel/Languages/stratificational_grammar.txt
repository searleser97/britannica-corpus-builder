Stratificational grammar,  system of grammatical analysis in which language is viewed as a network of relationships and linguistic structure is considered to be made up of several structural layers, or strata. Stratificational grammar derives in part from glossematics and in part from American structuralism. It was put forward in the United States as one of the principal alternatives to transformational grammar, but it has had much less impact elsewhere on linguistic theory and practice.
