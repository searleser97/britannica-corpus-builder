Phrynichus Arabius,  (flourished  2nd century ad, Bithynia, Asia Minor [now in Turkey]), grammarian and rhetorician who produced Sophistike paraskeue (“A Grounding in Sophistic”), of which a few fragments and a summary by Photius survive, and an Attikistes, extant in an abridged form, called the Ekloge (“Selected Atticisms”). He is critical not only of contemporary deviations from the best Old Attic usage but also of what he considers the lapses of his Attic models themselves. He went as far as to deny that the Attic comic poet Menander was a good model for Attic diction. In spite of some mistaken pedantry his judgments are often acute and learned and provide a useful commentary on the language of his own day.
