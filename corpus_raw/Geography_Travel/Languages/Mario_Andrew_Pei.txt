Mario Pei,  (born Feb. 16, 1901, Rome—died  March 2, 1978, Glen Ridge, N.J., U.S.), Italian-born American linguist whose many works helped to provide the general public with a popular understanding of linguistics and philology.
Pei immigrated to the United States with his parents when he was seven years old. By the time he was out of high school he knew not only English and his native Italian but also Latin, Greek, and French. Over the years he became fluent in five languages, capable of speaking some 30 others, and acquainted with the structure of at least 100 of the world’s 3,000 spoken languages.
As a graduate student at Columbia University, New York City, he learned such early languages as Sanskrit, Old Church Slavonic, and Old French. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1937 and from 1952 to 1970 was professor of Romance philology. Besides compiling the companion popular sellers The Story of Language (1949) and The Story of English (1952; revised 1967 as The Story of the English Language), he published a large number of both technical and popular works, including A Dictionary of Linguistics (edited with Frank Gaynor, 1954), Languages for War and Peace (1943), a guide to seven key world tongues and 30 minor languages, and Weasel Words: Saying What You Don’t Mean (1978).
