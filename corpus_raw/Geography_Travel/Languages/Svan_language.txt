Svan and the Georgian, Mingrelian (Megrelian), and Laz (Chan) languages constitute the Kartvelian, or South Caucasian, language family. Svan has four dialects and differs from the other Kartvelian languages especially in vocabulary. It preserves a number of archaisms not present in the other three Kartvelian tongues, although it also has a number of independent linguistic changes.
