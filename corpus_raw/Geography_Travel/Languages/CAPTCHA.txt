CAPTCHA,  a visual interface feature, or code, to stop automated computer programs, known as bots and spiders, from gaining access to Web sites. A CAPTCHA, which may consist of letters, numbers, or images, is distorted in some manner to prevent recognition by computers but not so distorted that a human with normal vision cannot identify the code and retype it.
In 2000 Yahoo! Inc., an American Internet services company, was having trouble keeping computer programs that were pretending to be teenagers out of its chat rooms, where the programs were collecting personal information and adding spam. Yahoo! contacted the computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University for help. Manuel Blum, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, led a group (including Luis von Ahn, Nicholas Hopper, and John Langford) that came up with the first CAPTCHA—an acronym for “completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart.”
As computer programs became more sophisticated, the early simple techniques of using overlapping letters and various background colours and patterns were replaced by using ever more broken or partial typefaces and highly distorted script characters. Carried to an extreme, many people found they could no longer read CAPTCHAs, which led to the development of CAPTCHAs based on identifying some object, such as a type of animal, from a photograph. The development of CAPTCHAs has spurred research in visual recognition, a field in artificial intelligence that has applications in optical scanning software, remote sensing, and robotics.
