Numic languages, formerly called Plateau Shoshonean,  North American Indian languages spoken by Native Americans in what are now the U.S. states of Nevada, Utah, California, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Arizona, Colorado, and Oklahoma. In the early 21st century, these languages were usually divided into three groups: Western Numic, including Mono and Northern Paiute; Central Numic, including Panamint, Shoshoni (or Shoshoni-Goshiute), and Comanche; and Southern Numic, including Kawaiisu, Ute and Chemehuevi, and Southern Paiute. Numic represents the northernmost extension of the Uto-Aztecan language family. Together with Tubatulabal, the Takic languages, and Hopi, the Numic languages form the Northern division of the Uto-Aztecan language family.
