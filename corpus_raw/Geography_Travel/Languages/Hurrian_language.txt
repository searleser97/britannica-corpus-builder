Hurrian language,  extinct language spoken from the last centuries of the 3rd millennium bce until at least the latter years of the Hittite empire (c. 1400–c. 1190 bce); it is neither an Indo-European language nor a Semitic language. It is generally believed that the speakers of Hurrian originally came from the Armenian mountains and spread over southeast Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia at the beginning of the 2nd millennium bce. Before the middle of the 2nd millennium bce, parts of Hurrian territory were under the control of an Indo-Aryan ruling class, the Mitanni, whose name was incorrectly applied to the Hurrians by early researchers.
Many sources for the language exist, including an extensive  Hurrian-Hittite bilingual and numerous passages marked hurlili ‘in Hurrian’ found among the cuneiform tablets discovered in the ruins of the Hittite archives at Hattusa (near the modern town of Boğazkale, formerly Boğazköy, Tur.). Other Hurrian texts have been found in the cities of Urkish (Mardin region, c. 1970 bce), Mari (on the middle Euphrates, 18th century bce), Amarna (Egypt, c. 1400 bce), and Ugarit (on the coastline of northern Syria, 14th century bce). Amarna yielded the most important Hurrian document, a political letter sent to Pharaoh Amenhotep III.
Hurrian constitutes the sixth language of the Hittite archives—after Sumerian, Akkadian, Hattian, Palaic, and Luwian.  The later Urartian language is thought to be descended from the same parent language as Hurrian.
