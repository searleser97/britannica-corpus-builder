Pitman shorthand,   system of rapid writing based on the sounds of words (i.e., the phonetic principle) rather than on conventional spellings. Invented by Sir Isaac Pitman, an English educator, the Pitman shorthand method was first published in 1837 as Stenographic Sound Hand. Pitmanâ€™s system classifies the sounds of a language into basic groups and makes use of simple abbreviations for rapidity. Consonants are drawn from simple geometrical forms, straight lines, and shallow curves. As far as possible they are paired; thus, a light slanted line stands for p and a heavier slanted line for b, a light vertical line stands for t and a heavier one for d, and so on. Vowels are indicated by disjoined dots and dashes that are placed in specific positions relative to the consonants and the line of writing. The system makes use of circles, loops, and hooks for sounds frequently used in consonant combinations and syllables (e.g., for s, st, str, spr, and -ter, -der, -tion). Syllables are also added by halving or doubling the length of a consonant stroke.
Pitman shorthand was introduced into the United States in 1852; among the many languages to which it has been adapted are Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, German, French, Spanish, and Dutch.
