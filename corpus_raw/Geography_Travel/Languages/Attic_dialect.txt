Attic dialect,   Ancient Greek dialect that was the language of ancient Athens. Its closest relative was the Ionic dialect of Euboea. With the ascendance of the Athenian empire in the course of the 5th century bc, Attic became the most prestigious of the Greek dialects and as a result was adopted later as the standard language by the Macedonian kings. Moreover, it became in Hellenistic times the language of the Macedonian rulers in the Middle East and Egypt. This later phase of Attic is called Koine, a dialect common to all Greeks.
In literature, Attic is the dialect of Athenian comedy and, interspersed with Doric lyric elements, of tragedy. In the second half of the 5th century bc, it also became the dialect of Greek prose, not only for such Athenian writers as Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, Lysias, Isocrates, and Demosthenes but also for foreigners such as the orator and Sophist Gorgias of Leontini (Sicily). During the Roman period, prose writers such as Plutarch and Lucian were Atticists: they preferred to use the classical Attic dialect of the 5th and 4th centuries bc, rather than the spoken Koine of their own time.
