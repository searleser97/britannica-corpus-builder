Yury Valentinovich Knorozov, Knorozov also spelled Knorosov,  (born November 19, 1922, Kharkov, Ukraine, U.S.S.R. [now Kharkiv, Ukraine]—died March 31, 1999, Moscow, Russia), Russian linguist, epigraphist, and ethnologist, who played a major role in the decipherment of Mayan hieroglyphic writing.
Knorozov fought in the Soviet armed forces during World War II and graduated from Moscow State University in 1948. About that time he became interested in ancient Mayan hieroglyphs, very few of which could be deciphered, and his researches on the problem earned him a doctorate in historical sciences in 1955. He was a senior associate for many years at the Ethnographic Institute of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg).
Knorozov brought a groundbreaking new approach to the field in an article published in the Soviet journal Sovietskaya Etnografia (“Soviet Ethnography”) in 1952. In it he argued that the glyphs written by the ancient Mayan Indians consist either of logograms (signs used to represent an entire word) or of phonetic signs; in the case of the latter, each glyph represents a consonant-vowel combination. Knorozov went on to correctly posit that a Mayan word made up of a consonant-vowel-consonant combination was written with two glyphs, with the vowel of the second glyph not pronounced. Hence, the glyphs for tzu and lu were pronounced tzul, which was the Mayan word for “dog.” Using this approach, Knorozov was able to decipher a wide array of hitherto incomprehensible Mayan symbols. He published his major work on the subject, Pis’mennost’ Indeitsev Maiia (The Writing of the Maya Indians), in 1963. His phonetic hypothesis earned widespread acceptance in the 1970s and enabled many ancient Mayan inscriptions to be read in their entirety.
