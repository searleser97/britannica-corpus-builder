Dai hyakkajiten,   (Japanese: “Great Encyclopaedia”), comprehensive Japanese general encyclopaedia, published in Tokyo.
It was first published from 1931 to 1935 in 28 volumes, with four supplements published in 1939–52, and was reissued in 15 volumes (1951–53). In 1955–63, a successor encyclopaedia, the Sekai dai hyakkajiten (“World Encyclopaedia”), was published in 33 volumes containing approximately 70,000 articles signed by specialists; it quickly became the standard Japanese encyclopaedia. The final three volumes contain supplementary material, which includes not only updated information covering the years 1958–63 but also a chronological table of world history; a comprehensive list of Japanese cities, towns, and villages; and indexes of abbreviations and proper nouns.
Sekai dai hyakkajiten was completely revised (1964–68) in 23 volumes, with two supplementary atlas volumes.
