Gudbrandur Vigfússon,  (born March 13, 1827, Dalasýsla, Ice.—died  Jan. 31, 1889, Oxford), one of the 19th century’s foremost scholars of Old Norse, who completed the Richard Cleasby Icelandic–English Dictionary (1874; 2nd ed., 1957) and published editions of a number of Icelandic sagas as well as the collection Corpus poeticum boreale (1883; “Body of Northern Poetry”).
Vigfússon studied in Iceland and at the University of Copenhagen but took no degree. As a research fellow at Copenhagen (1854–64), Vigfússon published his first work, the Timatel (1855), a brilliant attempt at establishing the chronologies of the Icelandic family sagas, followed by editions of Icelandic works, the first volume of the Biskupa sögur (1858; “Bishops’ Sagas”) and the Eyrbyggja saga (1864). Persuaded to move to Oxford to supervise completion of the Cleasby Icelandic–English lexicographical enterprise (1864), he collaborated on the Flateyjarbók (1860–68; The Flatey Book, 1893) and published his edition of the Badar saga (1869). In 1871 he was granted an honorary M.A. degree by Christ Church, Oxford, became a member of the college, and from 1884 was a reader in Old Icelandic. In the works of his later years, including editions of the Sturlunga saga (1878), the Hákonar saga (1887), and the Corpus poeticum boreale, he wrote prefaces and notes showing insight into literary and historical problems far ahead of his contemporaries.
