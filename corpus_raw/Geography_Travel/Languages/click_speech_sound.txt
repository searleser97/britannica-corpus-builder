Click,  in phonetics, a suction sound made in the mouth. Click sounds occur in a number of African languages and are often used as interjections in other languages—e.g., the sound of disapproval represented in English by tsk, tsk. That sound is an example of a dental click; to make it, the back of the tongue contacts the soft palate and the sides and tip of the tongue touch the teeth. The click noise occurs when the tip of the tongue is lowered. Other click sounds differ in the positions of the tip and blade of the tongue and in the manner of the release of air into the mouth cavity.
Clicks are a regular part of the consonant system in the Khoisan languages (sometimes called click languages) of such peoples as the Nama and !Xóõ. Linguists have distinguished five distinctive sounds, including dental clicks (as described above), lateral clicks (like the clucking sound made to horses), alveolar clicks (in which the tip of the tongue is on the ridge behind the upper teeth), postalveolar clicks, and, in some dialects, bilabial clicks (making the sound of a kiss), as well as a number of variants. Nguni languages of southern Africa, which include Zulu and Xhosa, are believed to have borrowed their clicks from Khoisan languages. See also Khoisan languages, which contains several audio clips.
