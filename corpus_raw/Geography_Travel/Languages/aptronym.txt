Aptronym,  a name that fits some aspect of a character, as in Mr. Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wiseman in John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress or Mrs. Malaprop in Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s play The Rivals. The term aptronym was allegedly coined by the American newspaper columnist Franklin P. Adams, by an anagrammatic reordering of the first letters of patronym (to suggest apt) to denote surnames that suit the occupation of the name’s bearer (such as Baker for a baker). Both aptronym and the synonymous euonym are rarely encountered.
