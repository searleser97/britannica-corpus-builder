Baudot Code,  telegraph code developed by J.-M.-E. Baudot in France, which by the mid-20th century supplanted the Morse Code for most printing telegraphy. It consisted originally of groups of five “on” and “off” signals of equal duration, representing a substantial economy over the Morse system, composed of short dots and long dashes. In Baudot Code, each group of five signals represented a single character; the code therefore provided 32 combinations. Modern versions of the Baudot Code usually use groups of seven or eight “on” and “off” signals. Groups of seven permit transmission of 128 characters; with groups of eight, one member may be used for error correction or other function. See also teleprinter.
