Stenotypy,   a system of machine shorthand in which letters or groups of letters phonetically represent syllables, words, phrases, and punctuation marks. The machine—mainly the commercial Stenotype, or Stenograph—which is commonly used in court reporting, is virtually noiseless and can be operated at speeds of more than 250 words per minute. It consists of letter keys, a space key, a correction key, and a numeral bar that operates like the shift bar on a typewriter.
The machine is operated with both hands, and several keys may be struck simultaneously to print a complete word with one stroke. In contrast to the variety of handwritten shorthand systems, stenotype recordings can be read by anyone familiar with the system, because stenotypy does not lend itself to individual modification.
