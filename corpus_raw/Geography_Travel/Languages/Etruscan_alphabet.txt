Etruscan alphabet,  writing system of the Etruscans, derived from a Greek alphabet (originally learned from the Phoenicians) as early as the 8th century bc. It is known to modern scholars from more than 10,000 inscriptions.
Like the alphabets of the Middle East and the early forms of the Greek alphabet, the Etruscan script was usually written from right to left but occasionally appears in boustrophedon style (i.e., the direction of writing alternates with each line, right-to-left/left-to-right). The alphabet went through many changes in form and composition over the course of time; it achieved its final (“classical”) form about 400 bc, with 20 letters—four vowels (a,e,i,u) and 16 consonants—a reduction from earlier forms with 26 letters (c. 700 bc) and 23 letters (5th century bc). The script continued to be written in its classical form until at least the 1st century ad. The Etruscan language ceased to be spoken in the time of imperial Rome but continued to be used in a religious context until late antiquity. The Etruscan writing system gave rise to the other Italic alphabets, including the Latin alphabet, which finally replaced it.
