Gregg shorthand,  system of rapid writing based on the sounds of words that uses the curvilinear motion of ordinary longhand. Devised by the Irishman John Robert Gregg (1867â€“1948), who originally called it light-line phonography and published under that name in pamphlet form in 1888 in England, the system was taken in 1893 to the United States, where it is now taught and used more than any other system. It has also been adapted to numerous languages, among them French, Spanish, Hebrew, Russian, Italian, Tagalog, Chinese, and Polish.
Characteristics of Gregg shorthand include a total absence of shading or thickening (in contrast to Pitman shorthand), the expression of vowels by circles and hooks that are inserted in word outlines in their natural order, a preponderance of curved motion to aid writing, and on-the-line writing. Gregg shorthand also uses brief forms for some of the commonest words, consonant clusters, and suffix and prefix forms and has an abbreviation principle.
