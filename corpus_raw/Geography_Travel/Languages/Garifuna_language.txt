Garífuna language, formerly also called Black Carib language,  an Arawakan language spoken by approximately 190,000 people in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and also by many who have emigrated to the United States. The language’s presence in Central America is relatively recent. African slaves mingled with the Caribs of Saint Vincent and Dominica, and a new ethnic group, the Garífuna, emerged. That group was deported by British forces to Central America beginning in 1797, the majority arriving about 1832. Thus, Garífuna is a variety of Island Carib (also known as Iñeri or Igneri), an offshoot from 300 years ago of the Island Carib women’s speech of the Lesser Antilles. Those islands had been invaded by Caribs who claimed descent from the Galibi, a Cariban group from Brazil and what is now French Guiana. The language remained basically that of the aboriginal Arawakan people, but with a men’s jargon in which Carib forms could be substituted for Arawakan equivalents, based probably on an old Carib pidgin, scarcely attested. The women’s Arawakan language did not change much over time, but the Garífuna men’s forms derived from Carib were mostly lost. That explains how Garífuna (Black Carib) can be an Arawakan language but have a name that suggests a Cariban connection. The names Carib and Garífuna are both derived from Proto-Cariban *karípona ‘native, indigenous person.’
