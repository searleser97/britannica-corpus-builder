John of Garland, also called Johannes de Garlandia,  (born c. 1180, England—died c. 1252), English grammarian and poet whose writings were important in the development of medieval Latin. Though much of his life was spent in France, his works were influential mainly in England.
Garland went to Paris (1202) to complete his studies and remained there as a teacher until 1229, when he went to the University of Toulouse. He fled Toulouse, however, in 1232 or 1233 because of conflicts ensuing from the defeat of the heretical Cathari, or Albigenses.
Among his grammatical works were Compendium grammatice (“Outline of Grammar”), Liber de constructionibus (“Book on Constructions”), and a Latin vocabulary. Two of his best-known poems are De triumphis ecclesiae (“On the Triumphs of the Church”), which gives a detailed account of the crusade against the Cathari, and Epithalamium beatae Mariae Virginis (“Bridal Song of the Blessed Virgin Mary”).
