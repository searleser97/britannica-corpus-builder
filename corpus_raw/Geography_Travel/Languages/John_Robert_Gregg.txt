John Robert Gregg,  (born June 17, 1867, Rockcorry, County Monaghan, Ire.â€”died  Feb. 23, 1948, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Irish-born American inventor of a shorthand system named for him.
Gregg developed an interest in speed writing when he was 10 years old, and by the age of 21, in Glasgow, he had published a 28-page pamphlet, Light-Line Phonography (1888), presenting his own shorthand alphabet, which was phonetic and based on the regular cursive movements of familiar longhand. This alphabet later was adapted to 13 languages.
In 1893 Gregg moved to the United States. From 1900 he edited the Gregg Writer, a monthly magazine; and from 1920 he edited the American Shorthand Teacher, later called Business Education World. The basic Gregg book was Gregg Shorthand, first published in 1902 as a revision of Light-Line Phonography and revised frequently thereafter. He also published such works as The Private Secretary (1943). Gregg was president of the Gregg Publishing Company, based in New York City, and chairman of the board of the Gregg Publishing Company, Ltd., of London and of the Gregg Schools, Ltd., of London.
