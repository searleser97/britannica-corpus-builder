Jean-Jacques Ampère,  (born Aug. 12, 1800, Lyon, France—died  March 27, 1864, Pau), French historian and philologist who initiated important studies of the diverse cultural origins of western European languages and mythology. A world traveler, he wrote both scholarly works and Romantic poetry.
The son of the scientist André-Marie Ampère, Jean-Jacques Ampère in 1826 made his first journey to Germany, where his work greatly impressed the poet and philosopher J.W. von Goethe. On the basis of his study of Scandinavian mythology, Ampère was named to a chair in the history of foreign literature at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1830; three years later he became a professor at the Collège de France, where he did the research for his major philological works, Histoire littéraire de la France avant le douzième siècle, 3 vol. (1839–40; “History of French Literature before the 12th Century”), and Histoire de la formation de la langue française (1841; “History of the Development of the French Language”). In his theories of environmental influences on history, he was a precursor of the French critic and historian Hippolyte Taine. His personal life was largely dominated by his platonic love for the famous beauty and hostess Madame de Récamier, who was much older than he; Ampère carried on a long correspondence with her and was a habitué of her salon. In 1848 he was elected to the French Academy. In the company of the writer Prosper Mérimée, he visited the Middle East and, later, the United States and Mexico. Ampère’s major historical work is L’Histoire romaine à Rome, 4 vol. (1861–64; “Roman History in Rome”); his other diverse works include De l’histoire de la poésie (1830; “On the History of Poetry”) and Promenade en Amérique: États-Unis, Cuba et Mexique (1855; “Travels in America: The United States, Cuba, and Mexico”).
