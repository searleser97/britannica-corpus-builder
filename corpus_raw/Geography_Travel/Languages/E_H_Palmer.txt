E.H. Palmer, in full Edward Henry Palmer,  (born August 7, 1840, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England—died August 11, 1882, Wadi Sidr, Egypt), English Orientalist, distinguished as a linguist and as a traveler, among whose many translations is a version of the Qurʾān—the sacred scripture of Islam—that, despite some inaccuracies, captures the spirit and poetry of the original.
As a student, Palmer showed remarkable linguistic ability; in 1867 he was elected a fellow in Oriental studies at the University of Cambridge. The following year he joined an ordnance survey expedition tracing the route taken by the Israelites from Egypt through the Sinai Desert to Jerusalem, and in 1870 he accompanied Charles Tyrwhitt Drake, an explorer, on a further desert exploration. Both journeys he described in The Desert of the Exodus, 2 vol. (1871). The same year he published Jerusalem, the City of Herod and of Saladin, a Muslim view of the history of the city. He was professor of Arabic at Cambridge during 1871–81. In 1882 he was asked by the British government to enlist the sheikhs’ support for the proposed British occupation of Egypt and to take measures ensuring the safety of the Suez Canal. His first mission was successful, but he was ambushed and killed on a second.
Palmer’s many publications include Oriental Mysticism (1867) and The Song of the Reed and Other Pieces (1877), which include translations from the Persian and Arabic as well as original poems.
