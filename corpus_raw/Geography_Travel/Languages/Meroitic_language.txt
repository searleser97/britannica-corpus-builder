Meroitic language,  extinct language used in the ancient city known to the Greeks as Meroe and the area surrounding the city (now in Sudan). The language was used from about 200 bce until about the 4th century ce. It was written with two scripts: linear, or demotic, script, which was adapted to writing with a stylus and suitable for general records; and hieroglyphic, used mainly for royal or religious inscriptions in stone. Both were obviously inspired by their Egyptian counterparts, and in each some signs are identical in formation.
The known material written in Meroitic consists largely of funerary inscriptions of royal and private persons, captions accompanying temple reliefs, travelers’ and pilgrims’ graffiti, and a few lengthy memorial texts. Some short texts on potsherds are presumed to be fiscal in nature. That the Meroites also employed papyrus and parchment is known from fragments preserved at various sites, mostly in the relatively dry region of Lower Nubia. The funerary texts are the most numerous, and it was with these that scholars, notably Francis L. Griffith, began the decipherment in 1910.
Texts were usually written from right to left; inscriptions were sometimes written vertically. The writing is essentially alphabetic, each script having 23 signs: 15 consonantal signs, 4 vowel signs (1 of them occurring only in the initial position), and 4 syllable signs (for ne, se, te, and to). A number of new texts were discovered during the excavations occasioned by the building of the Aswan High Dam.
Although some scholars believe the language to be related to Nilo-Saharan languages (more specifically the Eastern Sudanic branch), nothing is known for certain about the relation of Meroitic to other languages, as it remains largely undeciphered.
