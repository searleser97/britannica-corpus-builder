Rangaku,   (Japanese: “Dutch learning”), concerted effort by Japanese scholars during the late Tokugawa period (late 18th–19th century) to learn the Dutch language so as to be able to learn Western technology; the term later became synonymous with Western scientific learning in general. With the exception of the Dutch trading post on the island of Deshima in Nagasaki Harbour, Japan remained inaccessible to all European nations for some 150 years after 1639, when the Tokugawa government adopted a policy of severely restricted economic and cultural contact with the West. The Dutch language was therefore the only medium by which the Japanese in the late 18th century could study European technology. The rangaku scholarly tradition heightened Japan’s later, wide-ranging responses to the West in the late 19th and 20th centuries. Dutch-Japanese dictionaries were compiled, and Dutch books were published. Rangaku scholars studied European medicine, military science, geography, and politics.
