M,  thirteenth letter of the alphabet. It corresponds to the Semitic mem and to the Greek mu (Îœ). The Semitic form may derive from an earlier sign representing waves of water. Early Greek forms from Thera, Attica, and Corinth closely resemble the early North Semitic rendering. The Lydian alphabet also has a similar form. These forms differ only in the direction of the writing. The Etruscan form is similar but has an additional stroke. Since this form is rare in Etruscan, the Latin form may have been borrowed directly from the Chalcidian.
Curious forms occur in the various Italic alphabets, including Umbrian, Oscan, and Faliscan. The rounded form appears in the uncial writing of the 5th or 6th century. The cursive hands of the 6th century show a different rounded form that is based on the Carolingian. The modern minuscule does not differ essentially from the majuscule letter.
The sound represented by the letter has been from the beginning the labial nasal. Of all sounds, the nasals are least liable to change, a fact that is reflected in the consistent history of the letter.
