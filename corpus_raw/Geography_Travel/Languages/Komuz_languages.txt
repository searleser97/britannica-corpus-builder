Komuz languages, Komuz also called Koman or Coman,  a branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family formed by a group of related languages spoken in the border area that separates Ethiopia from Sudan and South Sudan. The Komuz group consists of Koma, Twampa (Uduk), Kwama, and Opo (Opo-Shita). Another variety of Komuz, known as Gule (Anej), may be extinct because its speakers have shifted to (Sudanese) Arabic for daily communication.
In his 1963 classification the American linguist Joseph Greenberg also grouped Ganza and other so-called Mao languages of southwestern Ethiopia under Komuz, which he called Coman. More extensive data on these languages, however, has revealed that they belong to the Omotic group of Afro-Asiatic languages rather than to Nilo-Saharan.
