Uyghur language, Uyghur also spelled Uighur,  member of the Turkic language family within the Altaic language group, spoken by Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of northwestern China and in portions of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The modern Uyghur language, which was based on the Taranchi dialect spoken in Russia before the Russian Revolution of 1917, is classified with Uzbek in the southeastern (Uyghur-Chagatai) branch of the Turkic languages. The Turkic language known as Yellow Uyghur was closely related to Uyghur but subsequently developed in isolation from it.
The Uyghur literary language was originally written in Arabic script, but a modified Latin alphabet was officially adopted in 1930, and in 1947 a modified Cyrillic alphabet was adopted within the Soviet Union. In China the Arabic script continues to be widely used for writing Uyghur, although a modified Latin alphabet was introduced in 1969. The Arabic script was reintroduced in 1983, and it has since been the official Uyghur writing system. Education in the Uyghur language is coming under pressure from the Chinese government; Xinjiang University, which offered courses taught in both Mandarin and Uyghur, was in 2002 ordered to cease teaching in Uyghur.
