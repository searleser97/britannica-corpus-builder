Aramaic alphabet,  major writing system in the Middle East in the latter half of the 1st millennium bce. Derived from the North Semitic script, the Aramaic alphabet was developed in the 10th and 9th centuries bce and came into prominence after the conquest of the Aramaean states by Assyria in the 9th and 8th centuries bce.
The Aramaic language and script were used as a lingua franca throughout the Middle East, and documents and inscriptions in the Aramaic alphabet have been found in Greece, India, northern Arabia, and Egypt. The oldest inscription in Aramaic script yet discovered dates from approximately 850 bce.
The Aramaic alphabet consists of 22 letters, all indicating consonants (though some can also represent vowels), and it is written from right to left. It is ancestral to Square Hebrew and the modern Hebrew alphabet, the Nabataean and modern Arabic scripts, the Palmyrenian alphabet, and the Syriac, as well as hundreds of other writing systems used at some time in Asia east of Syria.
