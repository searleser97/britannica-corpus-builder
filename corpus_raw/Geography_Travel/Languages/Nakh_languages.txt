Nakh languages,   languages spoken in the Caucasus in southwestern Russia and in the Akhmeta district of Georgia. The Nakh language group includes Chechen, Ingush, and Bats (Tsova-Tushian). Because Bats has no written form, its speakers use Georgian as their literary language. The Nakh group, sometimes called the Central Caucasian languages, is often classified by scholars with the Dagestanian languages (among which are Avar and Lezgian) in a Nakho-Dagestanian, or Northeast Caucasian, language group.
