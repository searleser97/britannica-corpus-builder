Balochi language, also spelled Baluchi or Beluchi,  one of the oldest living languages of the Indo-Iranian group of the Indo-European languages. A West Iranian language, Balochi is spoken by about five million people as a first or second language in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, India, and Baloch diaspora communities.
Balochi is generally divided into eastern, southern, and western dialect groups. Eastern Balochi has been influenced by Sindhi, while Western Balochi has been influenced by Persian. Pronunciation varies depending upon dialect group. For example, ph is generally pronounced /f/ in the east but is pronounced /p/ in the west.
Balochi poetry dates to at least the middle of the 15th century ce. It was later recorded by using a local adaptation of Persian nastaʿlīq script. During the mid-18th century, Jam Durrak, the chief poet of the court of Mir Muhammad Nasir Khan of Kalat, wrote songs and poems that are still sung by Balochs.
