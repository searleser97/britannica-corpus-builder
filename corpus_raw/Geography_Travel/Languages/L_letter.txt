L,  twelfth letter of the alphabet. Ancestors of this letter were the Semitic lamedh, which may derive from an earlier symbol representing an ox goad, and the Greek lambda (λ). The form appearing on the Moabite Stone was rounded. Other Greek forms were found in early inscriptions from Attica and Corinth. The former was also usual in the Chalcidian alphabet, and the Etruscan form was similar. Thus the Latin and Faliscan alphabets derived their form L with the oblique stroke becoming horizontal. The modern form L derives from the Latin.
In the uncial writing of the 7th century or earlier, the vertical stroke was raised above the line. In Latin cursive of the 6th century, l appears as a rounded form, and this is the parent of the Carolingian form, from which derives the current rounded minuscule or the straight form.
The sound consistently represented by the letter throughout its history has been the liquid or “lateral” for which it at present stands. This is not made like the sound of R by twirling the tip of the tongue but by allowing the air to escape at both sides of the tongue or (as in Welsh) at one side only (written ll, a breathed consonant). In some languages, such as in certain Slavonic languages, the contrast between a back l and a front l is distinctive. This is not the case in English, but in general the English l is pronounced farther back than the l in German and certain other continental languages. The l in could or would is silent. An l is never doubled at the beginning of an English word except in a few words of Spanish or Spanish-American origin (e.g., llama) or Welsh origin (e.g., Lloyd).
