Isolating language,   a language in which each word form consists typically of a single morpheme. Examples are Classical Chinese (to a far greater extent than the modern Chinese languages) and Vietnamese. An isolating language tends also to be an analytic language (q.v.), so that the terms isolating and analytic are often used interchangeably in linguistics.
