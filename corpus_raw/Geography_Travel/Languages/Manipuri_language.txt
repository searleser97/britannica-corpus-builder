Manipuri language, Manipuri Meiteilon, also called Meitei (Meetei),  a Tibeto-Burman language spoken predominantly in Manipur, a northeastern state of India. Smaller speech communities exist in the Indian states of Assam, Mizoram, and Tripura, as well as in Bangladesh and Myanmar (Burma). There are approximately 1.5 million speakers of Manipuri, which is used as a lingua franca among the 29 different ethnic groups of Manipur. In 1992 it became the first Tibeto-Burman (TB) language to receive recognition as an official, or “scheduled,” language of India.
Manipuri has its own script, locally known as Meitei Mayek. Manipur state and its surround are the locus from which the Tibeto-Burman family spread and diversified, making the genetic assignment of the region’s languages very difficult. During the 19th and 20th centuries, different linguists conjectured that Manipuri belonged to one of several TB subdivisions. In the early 21st century the consensus view placed Manipuri in its own subdivision of the so-called Kamarupan group—a geographic rather than a genetic designation but one that must suffice until more definitive information becomes available.
Nonetheless, Manipuri clearly has the genetic features of the Tibeto-Burman group. These include three positional occurrences of the velar nasals, widespread stem homophony, semantic bleaching of verbs, duplication or elaboration, final particles, the predominance of aspect rather than tense, a lack of gender marking verb–final word order, and agglutinative verb morphology, with extensive suffixation and more limited prefixation.
