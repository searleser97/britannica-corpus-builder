Patronymic,   name derived from that of a father or paternal ancestor, usually by the addition of a suffix or prefix meaning “son.” Thus the Scottish name MacDonald originally meant “son of Donald.” Usually the “son” affix is attached to a baptismal name, but it is also possible to attach it to the father’s occupation (e.g., Clerkson). Sometimes a patronymic is simply the father’s given name (Thomas, Edward) or its genitive form (Edwards).
In some cultures the patronymic varies according to the sex of the child receiving it: in Russia, where everyone has a patronymic as well as a given name and surname, sons receive a patronymic ending in -ovich (e.g., Ivanovich) and daughters a form ending in -ovna (e.g., Ivanovna). A similar situation holds true in Norway.
