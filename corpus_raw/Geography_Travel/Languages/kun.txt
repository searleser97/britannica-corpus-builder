Kun, (Japanese: “reading”) , in full kun’yomi,  one of two alternate readings (the other is the on) for a kanji (Chinese ideogram, or character). The ambiguity of a kanji arises from its having two values, the first being the meaning of the original Chinese character from which the kanji is derived and a Chinese pronunciation of the character. In the second (kun) reading the pronunciation given the kanji is a Japanese word or word element, often equivalent to a Chinese understanding of the meaning of the character. Kanji typically have two or more kun readings.
