Michael Ventris, in full Michael George Francis Ventris,  (born July 12, 1922, Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire, Eng.—died  Sept. 6, 1956, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire), English architect and cryptographer who in 1952 deciphered the Minoan Linear B script and showed it to be Greek in its oldest known form, dating from about 1400 to 1200 bc, roughly the period of the events narrated in the Homeric epics.
As a boy, his fascination with the classics led Ventris to study Greek and Latin. A competent and zealous cryptographer at 14, in 1936 he heard the famed archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans lecture on the Linear B script that he had discovered at Knossós, Crete, in about 1900 and how it still baffled linguists and archaeologists. Ventris’ determination to solve the puzzle of this peculiar writing dated from that time.
At 18 Ventris published a paper in the American Journal of Archaeology supporting the possibility of a relation between the script and another problematic language, Etruscan. In 1949, following architectural studies that had been interrupted by service in the Royal Air Force during World War II, he began searching in earnest for the key to Linear B. The method by which he achieved success was essentially that of statistical analysis, aided by stray hints from the analysis of various arrangements of syllabic signs. After the publication (1951) of texts in an almost identical script found on the Greek mainland in 1939, Ventris’ progress was rapid. In June 1952 he announced over a British radio program that he had found the Linear B to be a very archaic form of Greek.
Joined shortly thereafter by the Cambridge linguist John Chadwick, they assembled dramatic evidence supporting Ventris’ theory. In 1953 they published their historic paper, “Evidence for Greek Dialect in the Mycenaean Archives.” Their Documents in Mycenaean Greek (1956; rev. ed., 1973) was published a few weeks after Ventris’ death in an auto accident, and Chadwick’s The Decipherment of Linear B (1958; 2nd ed., 1968) followed.
