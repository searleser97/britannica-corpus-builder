Moon type,  system of written letters invented in 1845 by William Moon of Brighton, East Sussex, to enable blind people to read. Moon type partly retains the outlines of letters in the Latin alphabet. Easily learned by those who have become blind late in life, it is the only writing system for the blind based on the Latin alphabet that is still in use in the English-speaking world (although it has been largely superseded by Braille).
