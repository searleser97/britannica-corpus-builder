Roman Jakobson, Russian Roman Osipovich Jakobson,  (born Oct. 11 [Sept. 29, Old Style], 1896, Moscow, Russia—died  July 18, 1982, Boston, Mass., U.S.), Russian born American linguist and Slavic-language scholar, a principal founder of the European movement in structural linguistics known as the Prague school. Jakobson extended the theoretical and practical concerns of the school into new areas of study.
Jakobson left Moscow for Prague in 1920. In 1928, with his colleagues of the Prague school, Nikolaj S. Trubetzkoy and S.I. Karcevskij, he announced his hypothesis that phonemes, the smallest units of speech sounds that distinguish one word from another, are complexes of binary features, such as voiced/unvoiced and aspirated/unaspirated. Among his early works were Remarques sur l’évolution phonologique du russe comparée à celles des autres langues slaves (1929; “Comments on Phonological Change in Russian Compared with That in Other Slavic Languages”) and Kharakteristichke yevrazi-yskogo yazykovogo soyuza (1931; “Characteristics of the Eurasian Language Affinity”).
Jakobson began his association with Masarykova University of Brno, Czech., in 1933, becoming professor of Russian philology (1934) and Czech medieval literature (1937) there. The European political situation, however, compelled him to flee successively to the universities of Copenhagen, Oslo, and Uppsala, Swed., where he served as visiting professor. In 1941 he reached New York City, where he taught at Columbia University (1943–49). He was professor of Slavic languages and literature and general linguistics at Harvard University (1949–67).
The titles of Jakobson’s works indicate the expanding scope of his research—e.g., Kindersprache and Aphasie und allgemeine Lautgesetze (both 1941; Studies in Child-Language and Aphasia). Among his later works are Preliminaries to Speech Analysis (1952), a pioneering work in the distinctive feature analysis of speech sounds, written in collaboration with C. Gunnar, M. Fant, and Morris Halle, and Fundamentals of Language (1956; rev. ed. 1971), also with Halle. Jakobson’s Selected Writings, 6 vol. (1962–71), are concerned with phonological studies, the word, language, poetry, grammar, Slavic epic studies, ties, and traditions. His The Sound Shape of Language, with Linda R. Waugh, was published in 1979.
