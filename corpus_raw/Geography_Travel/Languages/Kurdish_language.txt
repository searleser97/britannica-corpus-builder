Kurdish language,  a West Iranian language, one of the Indo-Iranian languages, chiefly spoken in Kurdistan. It ranks as the third largest Iranian language, after Persian and Pashto, and has numerous dialects. It is thought to be spoken by some 20–40 million people. There are three main dialect groups. Northern Kurdish—spoken from Mosul, Iraq, into the Caucasus—is called Kurmānjī; in Turkey, Latin characters are used in the written form. Central Kurdish, called Sōrāni, emerged as the major literary form of Kurdish. It is spoken within a broad region that stretches roughly from Orūmīyeh, Iran, to the lower reaches of traditional Kurdistan in Iraq. It is usually written in a modified Perso-Arabic script, though Latin script is increasingly used. Southern Kurdish, also called Pehlewani, consists of a number of less-studied dialects.
