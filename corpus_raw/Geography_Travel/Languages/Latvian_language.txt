Latvian language, also called Lettish, Latvian Latviesu Valoda,  East Baltic language spoken primarily in Latvia, where it has been the official language since 1918. It belongs to the Baltic branch of the Indo-European family of languages. (See Baltic languages.) In the late 20th century Latvian was spoken by about 1.5 million people.
The earliest texts in Latvian, a Roman Catholic catechism and a Lutheran catechism, both written in Gothic script, date from the 16th century. The first grammar of the language appeared in the 18th century, and by the end of the 19th century the literary language was well developed. A modified Latin alphabet was adopted in 1922.
Latvian has three dialect groups: East, or High, Latvian; West Latvian; and Central Latvian. The last is more conservative and was the basis for the modern literary language.
Although closely related to Lithuanian, Latvian is more innovating than Lithuanian in many respects; for example, the reduction of vowels in final syllables has progressed much further in Latvian. Furthermore, because of the influence of Finnish, word accent has been fixed on the first syllable.
