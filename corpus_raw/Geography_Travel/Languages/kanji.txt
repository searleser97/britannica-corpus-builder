Kanji, (Japanese: “Chinese character”)  in the Japanese writing system, ideograms (or characters) adapted from Chinese characters. Kanji constitute one of the two systems used to write the Japanese language, the other being the two indigenous kana syllabaries (hiragana and katakana).
Ancient Japan had no writing system for its spoken language until kanji were imported from China in about the 8th century ce. With the development of the kana syllabaries, kanji came to be employed for writing nouns, verb roots, adjectives, and other important words. Nouns often consist of compound characters: two or more kanji written together. The Japanese affixes for verb tenses, prepositions, and other grammatical markers, which do not exist in Chinese, were then indicated by kana (typically hiragana). The pronunciation of kanji symbols may be indicated as well by hiragana script.
