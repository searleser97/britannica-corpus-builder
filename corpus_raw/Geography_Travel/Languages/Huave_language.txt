Huave language,  a language isolate (i.e., a language with no known relatives) on the Pacific coast in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. It is spoken in four main towns—San Francisco del Mar, San Dionisio del Mar, San Mateo del Mar, and Santa María del Mar—with a total of about 18,000 speakers. Attempts to find relationships between it and other languages have not been successful, though proposals have hypothesized links with Mayan, Mixe-Zoquean, Otomanguean, and even “Algonquian-Gulf.”
