Quechuan languages,   the languages of the former Inca Empire in South America and the principal native languages of the central Andes today. According to archaeological and historical evidence, the original languages were probably spoken in a small area in the southern Peruvian highlands until about 1450; after that their geographical range was rapidly enlarged by the Inca conquests. When the Spanish conquered the empire in 1532, Quechuan languages were spoken in western South America from what is now southern Colombia to central Chile and from the Pacific coast to the borders of the Amazon Basin.
Although the languages are still spoken by a large population of Indians, many of whom are monolingual, they are slowly losing ground to the Spanish language, which is the language of government and education. Some scholars place the Quechuan languages and the Aymaran languages together in a Quechumaran grouping.
