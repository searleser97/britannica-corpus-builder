Canaanite languages,   group of Northern Central or Northwestern Semitic languages including Hebrew, Moabite, Phoenician, and Punic. They were spoken in ancient times in Palestine, on the coast of Syria, and in scattered colonies elsewhere around the Mediterranean. An early form of Canaanite is attested in the Tell el-Amarna letters (c. 1400 bc). Moabite, which is very close to Hebrew, is known chiefly from one inscription dating from the 8th century bc. The only living Canaanite language is Hebrew, which was revived as a spoken language in the 19th and 20th centuries. See also Hebrew language; Phoenician language.
