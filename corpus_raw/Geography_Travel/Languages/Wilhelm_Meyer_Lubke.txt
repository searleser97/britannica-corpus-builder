Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke,  (born Jan. 30, 1861, Dübendorf, Switz.—died  Oct. 4, 1936, Bonn), Swiss-German linguist whose comparative studies of the Romance languages and the popular spoken Latin from which they developed revolutionized Romance linguistics. Adhering to the tenets of the Neogrammarian school of linguistics, he advocated rigorous research methodology.
After teaching at the University of Jena (1887–90), he joined the faculty of the University of Vienna, where he remained until his appointment at the University of Bonn (1915). An important early work was his historical-critical Italian grammar (1891). The work that established his reputation as a comparativist, however, was the Grammatik der romanischen Sprachen, 4 vol. (1890–1902; “Grammar of the Romance Languages”). Most successful in methodology, Meyer-Lübke reached his peak in the Einführung in das Studium der romanischen Sprachwissenschaft (1901; “Introduction to the Study of Romance Linguistics”). He also published a spate of manuals and monographs on Old Sardinian, Old Portuguese, Catalan, and Romanian. His wide influence has continued to the present. In the 1960s a number of his works were reissued, and a revision of his great Romanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch (“Romance Etymological Dictionary”), which was originally published between 1911 and 1920, appeared in 1968.
