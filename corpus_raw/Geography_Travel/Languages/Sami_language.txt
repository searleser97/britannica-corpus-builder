Sami language, also called Lapp,  any of three members of the Finno-Ugric group of the Uralic language family, spoken by the Sami (Lapp) people in northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway and on the Kola Peninsula in Russia. The Sami languages, which are mutually unintelligible, are sometimes considered dialects of one language. The largest language, North Sami, spoken by about two-thirds of all Sami, is distributed over northernmost Finland, Sweden, and Norway. East Sami is spoken in Russia on the Kola Peninsula and by two groups in eastern Finland: Inari and Skolt. South Sami is used by a few persons in central Norway and north-central Sweden.
Nearly all Sami are bilingual in a Sami language and in the official language of the country in which they live. The Sami languages have some literature and are used in newspapers, but they are little used in education or government; they also lack a uniform orthography or literary language.
The Sami languages share many features with the Baltic-Finnic languages (Finnish, Estonian, Karelian, etc.; see Finno-Ugric languages), although they cannot be closely related to any of these. In linguistic structure their grammars are similar to that of Finnish, although their syntax has been influenced by the Scandinavian languages. The sound system of South Sami, however, is largely unlike that of its neighbours, in particular its correlative quantity system, in which a kind of balance is maintained between the vowels and consonants of the stemâ€”the longer the one, the shorter the other. The Sami languages contain many Scandinavian and some Russian loanwords.
