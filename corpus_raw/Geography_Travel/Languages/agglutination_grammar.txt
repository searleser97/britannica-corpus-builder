Agglutination,  a grammatical process in which words are composed of a sequence of morphemes (meaningful word elements), each of which represents not more than a single grammatical category. This term is traditionally employed in the typological classification of languages. Turkish, Finnish, and Japanese are among the languages that form words by agglutination. The Turkish term ev-ler-den “from the houses” is an example of a word containing a stem and two word elements; the stem is ev- “house,” the element -ler- carries the meaning of plural, and -den indicates “from.” In Wishram, a dialect of Chinook (a North American Indian language), the word ačimluda (“He will give it to you”) is composed of the elements a- “future,” -č- “he,” -i- “him,” -m- “thee,” -1- “to,” -ud- “give,” and -a “future.”
Agglutinating languages contrast with inflecting languages, in which one word element may represent several grammatical categories, and also with isolating languages, in which each word consists of only one word element. Most languages are mixtures of all three types.
