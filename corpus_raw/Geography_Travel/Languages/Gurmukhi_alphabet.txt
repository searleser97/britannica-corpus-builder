Gurmukhi alphabet,  writing system developed by the Sikhs in India for their sacred literature. It seems to have been modified from the Lahnda script, which is used to write the Punjabi, Sindhi, and Lahnda (now considered to consist of Siraiki and Hindko) languages. Lahnda, Gurmukhi, and two other scripts used in northwestern India—Sharada and Takri—make up a related group that is probably descended from a common ancestor. According to Sikh tradition, Gurmukhi (literally, “from the mouth of the Guru”) was invented in the mid-16th century by Angad, the second Sikh Guru (head of the Sikh religion), in order to correct certain inadequacies in the Lahnda script so that sacred literature might be accurately recorded. However, the script is known to have existed before Angad’s time, and he is now considered the popularizer or standardizer of Gurmukhi rather than its originator.
