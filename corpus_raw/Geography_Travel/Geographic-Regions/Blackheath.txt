Blackheath,  open common and residential area mainly in the Greater London boroughs of Lewisham and Greenwich. It lies about 6 miles (10 km) southeast of the City of London. The site of both Roman and Saxon remains, the heath was crossed by the Roman Watling Street (now partly traced by Shooter’s Hill Road). Blackheath was the rallying ground of historic English popular rebellions under Wat Tyler (beheaded 1381) and Jack Cade (died 1450). In 1497 an army of Cornish rebels was crushed there by the forces of Henry VII. The site of England’s first golf club (founded in 1608 by James I, who brought the sport from Scotland), Blackheath became a notorious haunt of highwaymen. It now serves as a recreational common of some 270 acres (110 hectares) and is bordered by Greenwich Park to the north.
