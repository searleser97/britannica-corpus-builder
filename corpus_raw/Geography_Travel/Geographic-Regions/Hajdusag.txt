Hajdúság,  region in northeastern Hungary. It lies between the rivers east and south of the Tisza River to the northwest, the Nyírseg region to the east, and the Hortobágy steppe to the south. Nearby are several towns with the same prefix (Hajdúnánás, Hajdúdorog, Hajdúvid, Hajdúhadház, Hajdúszoboszló, Hajdúsámson, Hajdúszovát, and Hajdúböszörmény, the largest). The modern inhabitants of the Hajdúság are descendants of peoples who fled the westward expansion of the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century. Some are descended from local hajtó (herdsmen) of the region, and some from Magyar and Slav hajdus (foot soldiers) who fought for István Bocskay (1557–1606), prince of Transylvania. This militarized population, called haiduk (“brigand,” or “bandit”) by the Turks, were granted lands, privileges, and title exemptions by Bocskay. The region’s fortified towns and their citizens played a role in the struggles against both the Turks and the Habsburgs. Hajdúböszörmény was the capital of these military settlements until 1876, when the area was incorporated into Hajdú-Bihar county and the privileges were terminated.
