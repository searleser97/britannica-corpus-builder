Camargue,  delta region in Bouches-du-Rhône département, Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur région, southern France. The region lies between the Grand and Petit channels of the Rhône River and has an area of 300 square miles (780 square km). In the northern part of the delta, the alluvium has emerged as dry land; in the south, the highest ground is along the embankments of present and former watercourses; in the intervening basins are marshes and shallow lagoons.
Sparsely populated, the region was formerly entirely wild, with roaming herds of bulls (raised for Provençal bullfights) and wild Camargue horses. The conquest of the northern Camargue began at the end of the 19th century with the appearance of vineyards, followed by forage crops and grains; more recently fruits and vegetables have been cultivated. The great free-roaming herds of cattle and horses the region is known for are still found, especially around the edge of the Vaccarès Lagoon in what became the Camargue regional park. The growing of rice developed after World War II in an attempt to meet national demand and is still important. The salt that is so intimately a part of the marsh soils is exploited in the southeast between the Vaccarès Lagoon and the (Grand) Rhône River. A nature reserve at the Vaccarès Lagoon protects rare species such as flamingos and egrets. The Camargue is also a centre of pilgrimage (Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer) and of tourism.
