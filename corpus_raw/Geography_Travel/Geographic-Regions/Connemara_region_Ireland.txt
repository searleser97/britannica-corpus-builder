Connemara,  region of County Galway, western Ireland. It lies west of Galway city and Loughs (Lakes) Corrib and Mask. Referred to as a “savage beauty” by Irish writer Oscar Wilde, Connemara comprises ice-scoured, rock-strewn country mostly covered with peat bog. Between the city of Galway and Kilkieran Bay, more than 20 miles (30 km) to the west, the land rises gradually from the coastal lowland northward to more than 1,100 feet (335 metres); this area is traditionally called Iar (“West”) Connaught. The largest of the many islands in the bay, Lettermore, Gorumna, and Lettermullan, are linked with the mainland by road. True Connemara begins west of Kilkieran Bay and has a varied coastline and many islands, peat bogs, and lakes. It is known for its austerely grand scenery, Connemara ponies, and tweeds. North of the Clifden-Galway road are the sharp-peaked quartzite ranges of the Twelve Bens and Maumturks, with many summits more than 2,000 feet (610 metres) high. The population of the region is concentrated in a narrow coastal belt in which the cultivable land was built up from sand, seaweed, and manures, and the fields are protected by high stone walls. Clifden, the only town, was the terminus of a light railway from 1895 to 1935 and was once a small port. Roundstone is a small village and seaside resort.
