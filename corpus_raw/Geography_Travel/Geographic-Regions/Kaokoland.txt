Kaokoland, also called Kaokoveld,  geographic region, northwestern Namibia. It is inhabited by the Bantu-speaking Herero, Ovahimba, and Ovatjimba nomadic pastoralists. Kaokoland is bordered by Angola and the Kunene River to the north, the Owambo geographic region to the east, the Hoanib River to the south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It is an arid, sparsely populated, and extremely isolated region that was originally settled by the Herero, who migrated from central Africa in the mid-16th century. In the 1870s Boers trekking northwestward from western Transvaal settled in Kaokoland for a time before pressing on to Angola; the ruins of their buildings can be seen at Otjitunduwa and Kaoko Otavi.
Much of inland Kaokoland is mountainous, with an average elevation of about 4,500 feet (1,400 m). Numerous relatively short, rugged mountain ranges in the region are covered with a variety of grasses, succulents (such as aloe), and scattered dwarf trees. Between the mountain ranges and the Atlantic coast is a nearly uninhabited section of the Namib Desert that supports little vegetation except occasional succulents. A region of gravel plains and rock platforms, the desertâ€™s narrow coastal belt, called the Skeleton Coast, is often foggy and humid because of cool offshore currents. Water is scarce except along the Kunene River; elsewhere in Kaokoland pools of water are sometimes found in otherwise dry riverbeds. There are a few springs adequate to support limited irrigation of garden crops. The local nomadic tribes raise cattle, sheep, and goats; hunt wild game; and gather wild roots and berries after rains. Diamonds are sometimes found along the coast, and iron ore has been discovered inland. Opuwo (also called Ohopoho) and Kaoko Otavi are the main settlements.
