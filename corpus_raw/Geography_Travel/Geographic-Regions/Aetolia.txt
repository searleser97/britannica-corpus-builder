Aetolia, also spelled Aitolia,  district of ancient Greece, located directly north of the Gulf of Corinth and bounded by Epirus (north), Locris (east), and Acarnania (west). In modern Greece, Aetolia is linked with Acarnania in the department of Aitolía kai Akarnanía. Aetolia, particularly its cities Pleuron and Calydon, figures prominently in early legend. During the great migrations (1200–1000 bc) most of the region’s early inhabitants were displaced; those tribes that remained still lived in open villages under petty kings in the 5th century bc and were dedicated to piracy. Their archers and slingers, however, repulsed an Athenian invasion in 426 bc, and by 367 they had organized into a federal state, the Aetolian League. In 27 bc Augustus incorporated Aetolia into the Roman province of Achaea. In the 15th century ad it passed successively under the rules of Albania, Venice, and, in 1450, Turkey. In the War of Greek Independence (1821–29), it was the scene of fierce fighting, notably the sieges of Mesolóngion (Missolonghi).
