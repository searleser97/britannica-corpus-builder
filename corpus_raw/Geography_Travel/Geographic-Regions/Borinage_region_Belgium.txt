Borinage,   coal-mining and industrial region of southwestern Belgium, Hainaut province, southwest of Mons. Borinageâ€™s development was based on coal extracted from the area since the Middle Ages. The mines are no longer operative; the principal industries are metallurgy (in the town of Jemappes) and glassmaking (at Boussu). The city and workshops of Grand Hornu constitute a remarkable reconstruction (begun c. 1820) of an ancient mine and its attendant industrial complex.
