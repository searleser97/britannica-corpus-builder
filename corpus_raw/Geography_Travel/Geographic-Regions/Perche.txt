Perche,  region of northern France on the border of Normandy, mainly in the east of the Orne département, with extensions into neighbouring départements. Formerly a county, it was united with the French crown in 1525. It is largely hilly country, the Perche Hills having summits of about 1,000 feet (300 metres). Perche is a district of mixed farming, especially dairying, and was once famous for its breed of draft horses (Percherons). Mortagne-au-Perche and Nogent-le-Rotrou, the chief market towns, were at different times capitals of Perche county.
