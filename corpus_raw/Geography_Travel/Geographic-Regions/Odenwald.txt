Odenwald,   wooded upland region in Germany, about 50 mi (80 km) long and 25 mi wide, situated mainly in Hesse Land (state) with small portions extending into the states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. A popular tourist area, it extends between the Neckar and the Main rivers and overlooks the Rhine Valley. The highest points are Katzenbuckel (2,054 ft [626 m]), Neunkircher Höhe (1,985 ft), and Krähberg (1,821 ft). The range is bounded against the Rhine by a rich and densely settled ancient migration route called the Bergstrasse (literally “mountain street”), along which Bensheim, Heppenheim, and Weinheim are the major towns. The wooded heights overlooking the Bergstrasse are studded with castles and medieval ruins. Orchards and vineyards lie along the western slope, and much of the range is contained within the Bergstrasse-Odenwald Naturpark.
The Odenwald, ancient hunting ground of the Nibelungen (Burgundians), was the background for the 13th-century epic poem Nibelungenlied. The Nibelungenstrasse, a road from west to east between Worms and Würzburg, is marked for tourists according to the events of the poem, though they probably occurred elsewhere in the Odenwald. Another legendary figure, popularized in the 19th century by Victor von Scheffel, was the “Wild Huntsman of Rodenstein,” who supposedly galloped with fearful din to Schnellerts castle, which now lies in ruins northwest of the village of Reichelsheim.
