Franconian Forest, German Frankenwald,  forested highland in extreme northeastern Bavaria Land (state), east-central Germany. It forms a physical and geological link between the highlands of the Fichtel Mountains and the Thuringian Forest. About 30 miles (50 km) long, the forest descends gently north and east toward the Saale River but more precipitously west to the Bavarian Plain. Its highest point is Mount DÃ¶bra (2,608 feet [795 m]). Along the centre lies the watershed between the Main and the Saale basins and between the Rhine and the Elbe systems. The principal tributaries of the Main rising in the forest are the Rodach and the Hasslach; of the Saale, the Selbitz. Small hamlets lie in clearings in the heath, bog, and woods of the Franconian Forest. The chief city is Hof, to the east. Kulmbach, Kronach, and Bayreuth lie to the west.
