Parts of Holland, also called Holland,  formerly one of the three separately administered divisions of the historic county of Lincolnshire, England. It now forms two county districts; the borough of Boston, the northern portion, includes the ancient port and its rural surroundings, while the mainly rural South Holland district is centred on the market town of Spalding. Much of the area is reclaimed fen, the fertile alluvial soils of which are mainly cultivated and yield heavy crops of corn (maize), potatoes, and vegetables. The area around Spalding is especially noted for its extensive bulb fields.
