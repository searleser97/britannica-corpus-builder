Girnar Hills,  physiographic region on the Kathiawar Peninsula, Gujarat state, west-central India. At the foot of one of the hills is a rock bearing one of the rock edicts of Ashoka (3rd century bce). The same rock bears an inscription referring to the construction of a lake, called Sudarshana, in the late 4th century bce by the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta. In the hills surrounding these two important historical records are numerous Jaina temples built by kings of the Solanki dynasty (961â€“1242).
