Baltistan,  geographic region of Gilgit-Baltistan, in the Pakistani-administered sector of the Kashmir region, in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. Drained by the Indus River and tributaries such as the Shyok River, Baltistan is situated on the high Ladakh Plateau and contains the loftiest peaks of the Karakoram Rangeâ€”K2 (Mount Godwin Austen; at 28,251 feet [8,611 metres] the second highest mountain in the world), Gasherbrum I (26,470 feet [8,068 metres]), and Broad Peak I (26,401 feet [8,047 metres]). Baltistan has a harsh climate, with an average annual precipitation of only 6 inches (150 mm). It contains several glaciers, including Siachen Glacier, the site of occasional skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani troops over the status of Kashmir. The valleys lie at elevations of 8,000 to 10,000 feet (2,500 to 3,000 metres). Baltistan is chiefly inhabited by Baltis, Muslim tribes of Tibetan origin who eke out a meagre living growing crops (mainly barley and fruits).
