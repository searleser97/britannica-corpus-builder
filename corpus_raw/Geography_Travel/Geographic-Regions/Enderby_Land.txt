Enderby Land,   region of Antarctica, bordering on the Indian Ocean and extending from Prince Olav Coast of Queen Maud Land (west) to Edward VIII Bay and Kemp Coast (east). Primarily a barren, ice-capped plateau in the interior sections, it rises to rugged peaks along the coast, where the Napier Mountains exceed 7,400 feet (2,260 m). The English navigator John Biscoe, sailing for Enderby Brothers, a London whaling firm, discovered the coast in 1831 and named it for his employers. Enderby Land, claimed by Australia, is the site of a research station opened by the Soviet Union in 1963.
