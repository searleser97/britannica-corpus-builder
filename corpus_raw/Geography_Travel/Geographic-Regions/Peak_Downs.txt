Peak Downs,   fertile region of northeast central Queensland, Australia, comprising rolling scrub- and grass-covered country studded with peaks of volcanic rock. Bounded by the Rivers Belyando (west) and Nogoa (east) and drained by the Mackenzie River system, the Downs were once the source of gold and copper. Cattle, sheep, and grains are now produced there, and the region is also a source of timber and coal. Visited in 1844â€“45 and named for the Peak Range, whose granite summits rise above 2,000 ft (600 m), by the explorer Ludwig Leichhardt, the area was pioneered by pastoralists in 1854. Principal settlements include Clermont, Blair Athol, Emerald, and Springsure.
