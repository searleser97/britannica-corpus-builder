Northern Kantō, Japanese Kita-kantō,  industrial region, east-central Japan, occupying portions of Gumma, Saitama, and Tochigi ken (prefectures). Situated just north of, and adjacent to, the Keihin (Tokyo-Yokohama) Industrial Zone, the area consists mostly of plains, interrupted by the Kantō Range and Echigo Range. Northern Kantō is neither an administrative nor a political entity.
The region’s industries include the manufacture of electrical machinery, metal products, and transport equipment. Copper, zinc, and iron mining, forestry, and sericulture are other economic activities. The silk and paper industries were first mechanized in Gumma prefecture in 1912 and 1914; an iron and steel factory opened in Koyuma in 1939. Later industrial development included precision machinery (began operation in Niza, 1946); diesel engines, trucks, and buses (Ageo, 1950); motor vehicles (Ōta, an aircraft-production centre during World War II); electrical appliances (Ōra, 1959); and textiles (Ashikaga and Kiryū). During the 1960s, industrial output developed rapidly, and as industries migrated outward from the Keihin area, Northern Kantō gained further importance. Although Northern Kantō’s heavy-industrial production is small compared with Japan’s other industrial regions, it is strong in light manufacturing. Cameras and electrical appliances are assembled from parts manufactured in Keihin and are returned to Keihin for distribution. Agricultural products from the area include rice, livestock, mulberries, pears, and chestnuts.
