Maghreb, (Arabic: “West”) also spelled Maghrib,  region of North Africa bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The Africa Minor of the ancients, it at one time included Moorish Spain and now comprises essentially the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plain of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. The weather of the Maghreb is characterized by prevailing westerly winds, which drop most of their moisture on the northern slopes and coastal plain, leaving little for the southern slopes, which maintain desert scrub fading into true desert in the Sahara to the south.
From the vastness of their mountain ranges, the native peoples of the Maghreb have resisted successive Punic, Roman, and Christian invasions. Not until the 7th and 8th centuries was the Maghreb conquered; the Arabs, who imposed on the native peoples the religion of Islam and Arabic, the language of the Quʾrān, thus absorbed the Maghreb into the Muslim civilization. Despite this absorption, most of the North African societies have preserved their cultural identity throughout the centuries.
The people of the Maghreb belong to both Berber and Arab ethnolinguistic groups. The Berbers are descended from the earlier inhabitants of the region and may trace their ancestry to Paleolithic times. Many other groups have invaded the area, including the Phoenicians, the Arabs, and the French. About one-sixth of the population of the Maghreb still speak one of the Berber languages (most of them in Algeria and Morocco), but most also speak some form of Arabic.
