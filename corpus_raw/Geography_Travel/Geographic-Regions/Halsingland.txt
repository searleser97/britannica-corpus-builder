Hälsingland,  landskap (province), east-central Sweden, in the southern part of Norrland region. It is bounded on the east by the Gulf of Bothnia, on the south by the landskap of Gästrikland, on the west by those of Dalarna and Härjedalen, and on the north by that of Medelpad. It is included in the administrative län (counties) of Gävleborg and Jämtland. Like the rest of Norrland, it is characterized by forests cut by fertile river valleys. Extensive forests have made sawmilling and the manufacture of wood pulp and cellulose the leading industries; there is some agriculture. The principal towns are Söderhamn, the southernmost; Hudiksvall, the largest and oldest (chartered 1582); and Bollnäs.
