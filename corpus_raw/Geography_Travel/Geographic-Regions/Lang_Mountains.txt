Lang Mountains, Norwegian Langfjella or Langfjellene, English Long Mountains,  mountainous area lying south and west of the Dovre Mountains in west-central Norway. The Lang Mountains include the Jotunheim Mountains, the Jostedals Glacier, the Hardanger Ice Cap, the Hardanger Plateau, the Bykle Hills, and many lesser features. The highest mountains in Scandinavia are found in the group, with Galdh√∏ Peak (8,100 feet [2,469 metres]) and Mount Glitter (8,084 feet [2,464 metres], including glacier at summit) being the two loftiest peaks. Several major fjords penetrate the region, including Bokna, Hardanger, and Sogn fjords, the latter being the longest fjord in Norway. Jostedals Glacier, in the northwestern part of the Lang Mountains, is the largest ice field in continental Europe. Most of the principal rivers of southern Norway originate in the Lang Mountains. The region, generally sparsely populated, is a centre for both winter and summer tourism.
