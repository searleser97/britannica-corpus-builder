Medelpad,  landskap (province) in the administrative län (county) of Västernorrland, northeastern Sweden. It is bounded on the south by the landskap of Hälsingland, on the west by that of Härjedalen, on the north by those of Jämtland and Ångermanland, and on the east by the Gulf of Bothnia. Fertile cultivated fields are found along the two principal rivers, Ljungan and Indalsälven, former logging routes that are now sources of hydroelectric power. The area between the two river valleys abounds in forests, mountains, and lakes. Artifacts from the Stone and Bronze ages indicate that Medelpad was one of the earliest-inhabited parts of the region of Norrland. Finds of Arabic, Anglo-Saxon, and German coins from Viking times attest to its early importance as a commercial and trading area, where the Ljungan and Indalsälven served as lines of communication between the east and west coasts of the Scandinavian Peninsula. Agriculture is practiced along the deeply indented coast, as well as in the river valleys. Leading industries are sawmilling and wood processing. The major town is the port of Sundsvall.
