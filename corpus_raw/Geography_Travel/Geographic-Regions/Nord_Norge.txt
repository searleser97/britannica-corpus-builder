Nord-Norge, English Northern Norway,  geographic region of Norway. It reaches from Nordland about 575 miles (925 km) northward to the North Cape (Nordkapp), the northernmost point in Europe. An arm of the Gulf Stream, the North Atlantic Current, which flows past its coast, provides a relatively mild maritime climate. Commonly known as the “Land of the Midnight Sun,” it has a five-month summer, from May through September; in the far north the sun does not set from mid-May to late July. The northeastern section includes the plain of Finnmarksvidda, but the remainder of the region is extremely mountainous, with dense forests and many rivers. The entire region is dotted with thousands of lakes, while the coastline is indented by numerous fjords. Adjacent to the coast are hundreds of islands, the most important group being the Lofoten-Vesterålen near Narvik.
Nord-Norge is connected to southern Norway via coastal shipping and passenger ferries and by highways and a railroad that runs as far north as Bodø in the middle of the region. Principal economic activities include fishing, farming (as far north as 70° N), shipping (especially Swedish iron ore through Narvik), and tourism. Bodø, Narvik, Tromsø, Hammerfest, Harstad, Vardø, and Kirkenes are the main towns and ports. Area 43,598 square miles (112,918 square km).
