New Territories,  part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, southeastern China. It comprises the northern portion of the Kowloon Peninsula from Mirs Bay (Dapeng Wan) on the east to Deep Bay (Shenzhen, or Houhai, Wan), an inlet of the Pearl River Delta, on the west and includes Lantau (Lantao) and other islands. Historically, New Territories also once included the so-called New Kowloon, an area currently considered to be administratively part of the Kowloon area’s urban districts north of Boundary Street.
By the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory, promulgated in 1898, Great Britain leased these territories from China for 99 years and expanded its control of Hong Kong territory beyond the former boundary line (later known as the Old Frontier Line) set up by the Convention of Beijing in 1860. This was the origin of the name New Territories. Although much of the terrain in the area is mountainous, the valleys are among the region’s most productive farmlands.  There are some major commercial and residential towns in the area as well, such as Sha Tin, Tsuen Wan, and Tai Po. Area 377 square miles (976 square km). Pop.  (2001) 3,343,046; (2005 est.) 3,597,900.
