Karnataka, also called Carnatic or Karnatic,  linguistic region of the Deccan plateau, south-central India, generally corresponding to Karnataka state. Of irregular shape, and defined as the area in which Kannada (Kanarese) is spoken, Karnataka was unified during the Vijayanagar kingdom (c. 1300â€“1600) until successive conquests by the Muslim kings of the Deccan, the Mughals, and the states of Maratha and Hyderabad greatly reduced its size. (The term has also been applied to the southern Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal because the Vijayanagars retired there in defeat.) The remaining kingdom continued as the independent Hindu state of Mysore until the British conquest in 1799, following the Mysore Wars. The Kannada-speaking people were leaders in the successful movement for the linguistic reorganization of India (1953 and 1956), which resulted in the addition of territories from Bombay (now Mumbai), Hyderabad, and Madras (now Chennai) to form Mysore state. The state was renamed Karnataka in 1973.
