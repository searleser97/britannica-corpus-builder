Bavarian Forest, German Bayerischer Wald,  mountain region in east-central Bavaria Land (state), southeastern Germany. The Bavarian Forest occupies the highlands between the Danube River valley and the Bohemian Forest along Bavaria’s eastern frontier with the Czech Republic. Located largely in the Regierungsbezirk (administrative district) of Niederbayern (Lower Bavaria), the highlands parallel the southeasterly flowing Danube for about 90 miles (145 km) from the Cham and lower Regen rivers to the Austrian border east of Passau.
The Bavarian Forest, occupying mainly granite and gneiss hills, is divided into two sections by a sharp quartz ridge known as the Pfahl. The ridge runs roughly along the Regen valley and ranges from 65 to 100 feet (20 to 30 m) in height. The Vorderer Forest, or Danube Hills, a rolling plateau situated to the southwest between the Danube and the Pfahl, seldom rises more than 3,300 feet (1,000 m) above sea level. Meadow, isolated farmsteads, and small hamlets dominate the landscape; only the higher and steeper slopes are still wooded. Northeast of the Pfahl is the Hinterer Forest, a higher and almost continuously forested mountain region where human settlement is confined to a few longitudinal valleys. Its highest peaks include the Grosser Arber, with an elevation of 4,777 feet (1,456 m), and the Rachel, Lusen, Dreisesselberg, and Grosser Falkenstein.
The climate of the highlands is severe and wet, supporting only modest yields of rye, oats, and potatoes produced on small valley farms. Coniferous forest predominates, with spruce the main species at higher altitudes and a mixed woodland of spruce, silver fir, and beech found at lower levels. Lumbering, woodworking, and glass grinding are the principal industries. The tourist trade is expanding as the reputation of the Bavarian Forest as a beautiful and uncrowded holiday resort area spreads. Each year many visitors explore the Bavarian Forest National Park, where more than 98 percent of the park’s 50.5-square-mile (130.8-square-kilometre) area is tree-covered and many species of plants, birds, and small animals thrive. Principal towns of the mountain region are Regen, Zwiesel, Waldkirchen, and Grafenau.
