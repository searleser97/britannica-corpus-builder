Carniola, German Krain, Slovenian Kranjska,  western region of Slovenia, which in the 19th century was a centre of Slovenian nationalist and independence activities within the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary. It was part of the Roman province of Pannonia in ancient times and was occupied by the Slovenes in the 6th century ad. Emerging as a distinct district in the 10th century, Carniola belonged to a series of ecclesiastical and lay princely houses until 1335 when it became a possession of the Austrian Habsburgs, who held it with only brief interruption until 1918.
The scene of Turkish raids and peasant revolts (15th–17th centuries) and of religious repression during the Counter-Reformation, Carniola underwent significant economic advance in the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly while it was ruled by Napoleonic France as part of the Illyrian Provinces (1809–14). Slovene nationalism also developed in Carniola in the 19th century, and during the 1848 revolutions against the Habsburgs, the inhabitants of the region tried unsuccessfully to create an autonomous Slovene kingdom within the Austrian Empire. In 1849 Carniola was reorganized as an Austrian crown land, which was dominated by Austrian bureaucrats. Under that administration the Slovene nationalist movement grew stronger, and in 1918 most of Carniola was attached to the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later called Yugoslavia). After 1947 Carniola was located entirely within Slovenia.
