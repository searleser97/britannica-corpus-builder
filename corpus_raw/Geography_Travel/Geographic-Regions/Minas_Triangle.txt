Minas Triangle, Portuguese Triângulo Mineiro, also called Triângulo,  western região (region) of Minas Gerais estado (state), southeastern Brazil. Roughly triangular in shape, the region is defined by the Paranaíba River to the west and north and the Grande River to the south. This 20,371-square-mile (52,760-square-km) area of undulating grasslands makes excellent grazing land for cattle, herds of which are collected in Uberaba and Tinguatiba and shipped to markets in São Paulo. The raising of chicken and pigs is also important. Major crops grown in the region are soybeans and corn (maize). Biotechnology has become a major industry, especially in the production of foodstuffs. There is some diamond mining in the tributaries of the Grande River. Minas Triangle is traversed by several highways and rail lines.
