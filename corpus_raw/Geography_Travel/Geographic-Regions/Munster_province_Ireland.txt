Munster, Old Irish Muma,  the southwestern province of Ireland, comprising the counties of Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, and Waterford. It was historically one of the “Five Fifths” (ancient provinces, or kingdoms) of Ireland. Geographically, the area is divided by the Sliabh Luachra Mountains into Desmond to the south and Thomond to the north.
The power of the kingdom originally lay in the south, where the ruling Érainn clan had their chief fortress at Temuir Érann in the Ballyhoura Hills in what is now County Limerick.  Inroads into northern Munster made by the neighbouring men of Leinster were fought off by a people known as the Eoghanachta, who were aided by dési, professional fighting men, who were rewarded for their efforts with land that became County Waterford and part of southern County Tipperary. An offshoot group of those dési invaded Connaught and deprived that kingdom of the area that is now County Clare. From 400 ce the Eoghanachta ruled Munster, establishing colonies in Cork and Kerry and making Cashel their capital. 
The Eoghanachta later unsuccessfully challenged the Leinster high kings and in the 10th century failed to defend their own land against Viking raiders who settled in Waterford and Limerick. That led to the collapse of the Eoghanachta dynasty, which was succeeded in Munster by the Clare dynasty of Dál Chais. In the 11th and 12th centuries, Eoghanachta power revived, especially in Cork (where the McCarthys, O’Callaghans, and O’Keeffes held sway), but the Dál Chais dynasty (the O’Briens) remained dominant, especially in Thomond. After the Anglo-Norman invasion of the mid-12th century, the feudal families of Fitzgerald, earls of Desmond, and of Butler, earls of Ormonde, became all-powerful in the province. Area 9,527 square miles (24,674 square km). Pop. (2002) 1,100,614; (2006) 1,173,340.
