Gulf Country,  lowland region of northwestern Queensland and northeastern Northern Territory, Australia, bordering the Gulf of Carpentaria. Crisscrossed by the distributaries of numerous rivers, the area supports the breeding and fattening of cattle. The stock is then collected at centres such as Normanton and Borroloola and trucked to slaughter or to transfer points, such as the port of Karumba in the north, for live transport overseas. The mining of copper, lead, and zinc is another economically important activity in the region.
