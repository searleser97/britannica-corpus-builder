Peary Land,   region, northern Greenland, extending about 200 miles (320 km) east and west along the Arctic Ocean, between Victoria Fjord and the Greenland Sea. One of the northernmost land regions of the world, ending at Cape Morris Jesup, it is Greenlandâ€™s largest ice-free part, with a generally mountainous surface rising to 6,398 feet (1,950 m). The coastline is deeply indented by fjords. Although the region is without human habitation, its vegetation supports herds of musk-oxen. It was partially explored in 1892, 1895, and 1900 by Robert E. Peary, the American Arctic explorer.
