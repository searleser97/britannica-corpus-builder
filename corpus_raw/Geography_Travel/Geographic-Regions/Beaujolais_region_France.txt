Beaujolais,   region of east-central France, just east of the Massif Central and west of the Sâone River. Most of the region is located within Rhône département. The local relief is broken and culminates in Mount Saint-Rigaud, 3,310 feet (1,009 m); well-wooded, the region supports a local forestry industry. Small family farmsteads characterize the region west of Mount Saint-Rigaud. To the east of it, the limestone escarpments of the Côte Beaujolaise, drier in climate, support a world-famous red wine industry.
