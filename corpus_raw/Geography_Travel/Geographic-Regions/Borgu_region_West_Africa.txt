Borgu, also spelled Borgou,  inland region of western Africa, covering parts of what is now Benin and Nigeria and bounded northeast and east by the Niger River. Its name probably derives from the aquatic grass called borgu, a cattle food. The peoples of the region formerly gave allegiance to the sultan of Borgu and the chief of Busa. After a dispute over the territory in 1894, an Anglo-French convention of 1898 declared the western part French and the eastern part British. Nigerian areas of this region are protected game and forest reserves.
