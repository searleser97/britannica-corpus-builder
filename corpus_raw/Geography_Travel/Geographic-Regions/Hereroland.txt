Hereroland,   geographic region of eastern Namibia, encompassing part of the western Kalahari (desert) and bordering Botswana on the east.
Hereroland occupies a semiarid area of gently undulating terrain; all intermittent rainfall drains eastward. Deep sands through which groundwater is not easily obtained support only perennial grasses, low-lying shrubs, and thorny woodlands; cattle are nevertheless grazed in the region near boreholes that have been drilled to provide drinking water. The Herero people who inhabit the region are nomadic herders of cattle and also grow subsistence levels of corn (maize), millet, and cowpeas; poultry and sheep are also raised.
The Herero, though never large in numbers, from the 17th through the late 19th century often dominated the intensively cattle-grazed Central Highland north of Windhoek, the present-day territorial capital. Their rebellion against German colonial encroachment between 1904 and 1907 led to the extermination of three-fourths of their population and to the eventual resettlement of some of the survivors in the mostly inhospitable sand veld of contemporary Hereroland. The standard wearing apparel of Herero women remains a colourful, long Victorian dress and train characteristic of the 19th century, worn mostly by contemporary German missionary wives. The principal settlements in Hereroland are Okakarara and Otjinene.
