Al-Jazīrah, also spelled El-Gezira,  region, central-southeast Sudan. Al-Jazīrah lies just southeast of the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers; the Blue Nile runs northwestward through the central part of the region, and the White Nile lies to the west. The Blue Nile is joined by the Dinder River at the southern border of Al-Jazīrah and is joined by the Rahad River east of Wad Madani.
Al-Jazīrah is the site of one of the largest irrigation projects in the world. Begun by the British in 1925, the Jazīrah (Gezira) scheme distributes the waters of the Blue Nile through a 2,700-mile (4,300-km) network of canals and ditches to irrigate fields growing cotton and other cash crops. This scheme has made Al-Jazīrah the most productive agricultural area of Sudan. Water for the scheme is supplied from the Sennar and Al-Ruṣayriṣ dams upstream on the Blue Nile.
Most of the population engages in agriculture, and crops include cotton, cereals, oilseeds, peanuts (groundnuts), wheat, sesame, durra (sorghum), dukhn (millet), and vegetables. A hydroelectric plant is located at Wad Madani. Industries produce ginned cotton, sesame and peanut oils, cigarettes, leather goods, soap, and processed foods. Wad Madani is the chief city of Al-Jazīrah. Most of the people are Arabs; the Nuba are the only significant minority.
