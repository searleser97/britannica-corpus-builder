Bluegrass region,  Area of central Kentucky, U.S. The region contains Kentucky’s best agricultural land and thus became the first area to be settled. It became known for its abundant bluegrass and became famous for breeding fine horses; the calcium-rich soil imparts its minerals to the grass and thence into the horses’ bones.
