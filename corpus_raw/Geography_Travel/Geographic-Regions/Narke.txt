Närke,  landskap (province) lying mostly in the administrative län (county) of Örebro, south-central Sweden. It lies between the traditional landskap (provinces) of Västmanland on the north, Södermanland on the east, Östergötland on the southeast, Västergötland on the southwest, and Värmland on the west. Dominating its landscape is the great central plains area, bordered by the Kils Hills (915 feet [279 metres]) on the northwest and wooded heights on the south. Two of Sweden’s largest lakes—Vättern and Hjälmaren—are partly within its boundaries. Based on the many small iron-ore deposits, ironworking was prevalent during the Middle Ages. Although some mining operations remain, particularly on the border with Östergötland, they have been replaced largely by forestry and related industries. The central plains area is one of the most agriculturally productive of central Sweden. The acreage of arable land has been greatly increased by the reclamation of swampland and by the lowering of lake levels. Among the leading industries are shoe manufacturing and food processing. Principal towns include Örebro, Kumla, and Askersund.
