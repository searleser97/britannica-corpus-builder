Makapansgat,  site of paleoanthropological excavation, one of the oldest of the known cave sites in South Africa containing Australopithecus africanus fossils.
Located about 240 km (150 miles) north of Sterkfontein, itself a major site that has yielded numerous hominin (of human lineage) fossils, the area around Makapansgat consists of dolomite cliffs pierced by several caves.
Searches at Limeworks Cave from 1947 to 1962 by a team led by paleoanthropologist Raymond Dart revealed the remains of about 40 individuals of Australopithecus africanus, a species of gracile (slender) hominin dating from 2.5 to 3 million years ago or more. The nearby Cave of Hearths yielded the right side of an early Homo sapiens childâ€™s jaw, dating from about 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.
