Uraha Hill,  a paleoanthropological site in northern Malawi known for the discovery of a jawbone of an ancient human (genus Homo) dating to 2.4 million years ago (mya). It is similar to specimens dating to between 1.9 and 1.8 mya from Koobi Fora, Kenya. The Uraha Hill specimen is one of the oldest occurrences of the genus Homo, and it fills the geographical gap between sites of East and South Africa.
As part of the collection of fossils attributed to H. rudolfensis, the Uraha Hill jawbone takes its place in the centre of intense debate on the origin of the human genus. It is the earliest member attributed to H. rudolfensis, but precise dates are difficult to establish. Some experts prefer to include all the specimens referred to as H. rudolfensis into a morphologically diverse species of large-brained, small cheek-toothed hominins (members of the human lineage) called H. habilis.
No stone tools are known from the stratigraphic layer containing this specimen. Animal fossils found at the site reveal a pattern of habitat change between about 4 and 1.5 mya. Particularly noticeable is a shift beginning about 2.8 mya, when the climate became dryer and cooler. This drying trend intensified by about 2.5 mya, when grasslands became more extensive.
