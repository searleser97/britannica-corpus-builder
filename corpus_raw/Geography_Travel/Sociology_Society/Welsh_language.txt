Welsh language, Welsh Cymraeg,  member of the Brythonic group of the Celtic languages, spoken in Wales. Modern Welsh, like English, makes very little use of inflectional endings; British, the Brythonic language from which Welsh is descended, was, however, an inflecting language like Latin, with word endings marking such grammatical categories as noun case and verb tense. The spoken language occurs in several local dialects but has been declining on the whole since the accession of Henry Tudor (Henry VII), of Welsh descent, to the English throne in 1485. At present few people speak only Welsh.
