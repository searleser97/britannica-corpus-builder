Volapük,   artificial language constructed in 1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer, a German cleric, and intended for use as an international second language. Although its vocabulary is based on English and the Romance languages, the word roots in Volapük have been modified to such a degree that they are virtually unrecognizable; for example, lol from English “rose,” nim from “animal,” and Melop from “America.” It is difficult to learn because of the unfamiliar appearance of the words and because it has a grammar nearly as complex as that of Latin. There are four cases for nouns, six pronouns with plural forms, and six persons and six tenses for the verb, as well as indicative, passive, infinitive, aorist, conditional-conjunctive, imperative, and participial forms, each with full or nearly full conjugation. Although the complexity of Volapük grammar made it difficult, regularity of spelling and grammar eased this somewhat, and in the 1880s, until Esperanto appeared as a competitor, hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts studied Volapük and published books and periodicals in the language.
