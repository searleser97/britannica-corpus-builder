Xinkan languages, Xinkan also spelled Xincan,  a small family of four languages from southeastern Guatemala: Chiquimulilla Xinka, Guazacapán Xinka, Jumaytepeque Xinka, and Yupiltepeque Xinka. Extinct and poorly attested Jutiapa Xinka may have been a dialect of Yupiltepeque Xinka or possibly an additional distinct language. Chiquimulilla Xinka and Yupiltepeque Xinka are extinct. The last speaker of Chiquimulilla Xinka died in the late 1970s. There are one or two elderly semispeakers of Guazacapán Xinka and Jumaytepeque Xinka. A very active group of young people are endeavouring to learn and revitalize Xinka, basing themselves primarily on Guazacapán Xinka.
Evidence from Xinkan place-names indicates that these languages formerly had a much-broader distribution. Since nearly all agricultural terms in Xinkan are loanwords from Mayan languages, with a few from Mixe-Zoquean languages, it is hypothesized that Xinkan speakers were not agriculturalists until they acquired knowledge of agriculture from their Mayan neighbours.
It is frequently thought that Xinkan and Lencan are members of a higher-order language family, but the evidence for this is extremely poor. Both are distinct language families with no known outside relatives.
