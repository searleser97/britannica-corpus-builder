Yeniseian languages, also spelled Yeniseyan, formerly called Yenisey-Ostyak languages,  small group of languages generally classified among the Paleo-Siberian languages. That category includes Yeniseian languages with three other genetically unrelated groups—Nivkh, Luorawetlan languages, and Yukaghir (itself now sometimes considered to be a distant relative of the Uralic languages).
The Yeniseian group contains at least four languages—Ket, Kott, Arin (Arrin), and Assan—but only Ket is a living language; Ket was classified as “moribund” in the early 21st century. It has been hypothesized that Yeniseian languages are distantly related to the Na-Dené languages (Tlingit and Athabaskan-Eyak but not Haida) of northwest North America; whereas some scholars believe that that proposal has merit, a majority do not, finding the evidence inadequate to support the hypothesized relationship.
