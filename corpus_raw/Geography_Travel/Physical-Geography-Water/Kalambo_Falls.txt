Kalambo Falls,   waterfall, the second highest uninterrupted fall in Africa (after Tugela Falls, South Africa), located on the Kalambo River near the southeastern shore of Lake Tanganyika on the Tanzania-Zambia border. The 704-foot (215-metre) drop in the falls is only part of a 3,000-foot (900-metre) descent along a 6-mile (10-kilometre) section of the Kalambo River. In the abyss is the breeding ground of the rare, giant marabou stork. Primitive tools have been excavated from Kalambo Gorge and dated by radiocarbon from 300,000 bc.
