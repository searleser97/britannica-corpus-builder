Scoresby Sund, English Scoresby Sound,  deep inlet of the Greenland Sea, which penetrates eastern Greenland for 70 miles (110 km). Numerous fjords (the longest 130 miles) extend to the edge of the inland ice cap, where they are fed by large glaciers. The sound, charted by William Scoresby in 1822, is dotted with islands; the largest, Milne Land, is about 60 miles long and 25 miles wide and rises to 7,987 feet (2,434 metres). Ittoqqortoormiit (also called Illoqqortoormiut; Danish: Scoresbysund) is a hunting and fishing town founded in 1924 by Ejnar Mikkelsen. The town lies north of the soundâ€™s mouth at a place where fishing is possible throughout the year.
