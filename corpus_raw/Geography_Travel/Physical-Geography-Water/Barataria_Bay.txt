Barataria Bay,  inlet of the Gulf of Mexico, about 15 miles (24 km) long and 12 miles (19 km) wide, in southeastern Louisiana, U.S. Its entrance, largely blocked by Grand Isle and the Grand Terre Islands, is via a narrow Gulf channel navigable through connecting waterways into the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway system. The bay is indented and marshy with many islands. The surrounding low-lying Barataria Country, south of New Orleans and west of the Mississippi River delta, is noted for its shrimp industry (based on villages built on pilings above the coastal marshes), muskrat trapping, natural gas and oil wells, and sulfur production. The area is sometimes called Laffite Country for Jean Laffite and his brother Pierre, who in 1810–14 organized a colony of pirates and smugglers around the Baratarian coast. The name Barataria is derived from the Spanish word meaning “to deceive.” Grand Isle, accessible from the west via a road bridge, is a resort community with a state park at its eastern end.
