Gulf of Lion, French Golfe Du Lion,  gulf of the Mediterranean Sea, extending along the coast of southern France from the Spanish border (west) to Toulon (east). The gulf receives the Tech, Têt, Aude, Orb, Hérault, Vidourle, and Petit and Grand Rhône rivers. When cold-air masses flow past the Alps and sweep southward down the Rhône River valley, the gulf experiences a dry, cold, northerly wind known locally as the mistral.
The gulf coastline includes the easternmost spurs of the Pyrenees, several lagoons, the Rhône River delta, and limestone hills near the city of Marseille. Many canals and waterways (especially, the Rhône River) link coastal areas with the hinterland. The Gulf of Fos, which receives the outlet from the Berre Lagoon, and the bay of Marseille are part of the Gulf of Lion. The major ports along the gulf are Marseille and Sète. The coast of Languedoc, west of the Rhône delta, has been transformed by the creation of new towns that are centres of tourism and recreation.
