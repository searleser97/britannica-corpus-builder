Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay, Spanish Bahía Sebastián Vizcaíno,  bay of the Pacific Ocean, western Baja California peninsula, Mexico. The bay is approximately 80 miles (130 km) long from northwest to southeast and 60 miles (100 km) wide from east to west; it has several islands, the largest of which is Cedros, known for its large colony of elephant seals. The northeastern and eastern shores, lying in the state of Baja California Norte, are generally sandy and have a number of small bays. The southern shores, in Baja California Sur state, are marked by swamps in the east and by sharply rising hills in the west. Point Eugenia is the southwestern extremity. The bay is of economic importance for the sharks and other fishes in its waters and for the saltworks on its shores.
