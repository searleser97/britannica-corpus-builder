Port Jackson, also called Sydney Harbour,  inlet of the Pacific, 12 miles (19 km) long with a total area of 21 square miles (55 square km), which is one of the world’s finest natural harbours and the principal port of New South Wales, Australia. It has minimum and maximum depths of 30 feet (9 metres) and 155 feet at low water, and its irregular foreshores extend more than 150 miles, affording extensive docking facilities. Its principal wharves are near Sydney’s business district.
Its entrance (1.5 miles wide) is between North and South Heads, where naval and military stations are located. The Parramatta River, Cockatoo Island (shipyards), and Middle Harbour Creek form the inlet’s western and northern branches. Sydney Harbour Bridge (1932), one of the world’s largest steel-arch types, with a span of 1,650 feet, connects Sydney on the south shore with its northern suburbs. The Sydney Opera House (1973), whose design suggests billowing sails, is located on Bennelong Point east of the bridge; in 2007 it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. The harbour was sighted in 1770 by Capt. James Cook, who named it in honour of Sir George Jackson, an Admiralty secretary.
