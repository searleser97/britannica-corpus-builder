Gulf of Ob, Russian Obskaya Guba,  large inlet of the Kara Sea indenting northwestern Siberia, between the peninsulas of Yamal and Gyda, in north-central Russia. The gulf forms the outlet for the Ob River, the delta of which is choked by a huge sandbar. The gulf is about 500 miles (800 km) in length and has a breadth varying between 20 and 60 miles (32 and 97 km). The depth of the sea at this point is 33–40 feet (10–12 m). Its eastern coastline is steep and rugged; the west is low-lying and marshy. Novy Port is the main port of the gulf.
