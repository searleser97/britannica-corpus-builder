Bay of Whales,  former indentation in the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica. First seen by the British explorer Sir James Clark Ross in 1842 and visited by a fellow countryman, Ernest Henry (later Sir Ernest) Shackleton, in 1908, the Bay of Whales served as one of the most important centres of Antarctic exploration.
The natural bay, created by uneven advancement of the ice shelf, was the continent’s most southerly open harbour in summer months and the site of several important bases, including those of the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen (1911) and the American explorer Richard E. Byrd (Little America I, 1928; II, 1933–34; III, 1940; IV, 1947; V, 1956). More than 10 miles (16 km) wide in 1911, the bay gradually narrowed until sometime in the early 1950s the advancing sheets collided and broke off the ice shelf, nearly obliterating the Bay of Whales and carrying away part of the Little America IV station. The Bay of Whales was entirely eliminated in 1987 when an iceberg 99 miles (159 km) long broke off from the Ross Ice Shelf.
