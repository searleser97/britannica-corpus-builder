Apalachee Bay,  arm of the Gulf of Mexico indenting the coast of northern Florida, U.S., 25 miles (40 km) south of Tallahassee. It receives the Ochlockonee, St. Marks, Econfina, and Aucilla rivers, and its marshy coast forms St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge. In 1528 five boats were built in the bay by Pánfilo de Narváez, a Spanish explorer who had decided to abandon his search for wealth in Florida and to set out for Mexico. The bay was named for the Apalachee people, who originally inhabited the area. Ochlockonee River State Park lies at the river’s mouth where it enters into Ochlockonee Bay (itself an arm of Apalachee Bay).
