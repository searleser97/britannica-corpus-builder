Oceanic trough,   an elongate depression in the seafloor that is characteristically shallower, shorter, narrower, and topographically gentler than oceanic trenches. Maximal depths of oceanic troughs range between 2,300 m (7,500 feet) in the Papuan Trough and 7,440 m in the Banda Trough. More typical maximum depths lie between 4 and 5 km (2.5 and 3 miles) below sea level. Lengths of the 25 best-known troughs range between 270 and 2,300 km and average about 700 km; their widths are from 20 to 100 km and average about 50 km. Unlike trenches, oceanic troughs probably owe their origins to a wide variety of geologic mechanisms.
