Gulf of Dulce, Spanish Golfo Dulce,  long, narrow inlet of the Pacific Ocean, bounded on the north, east, and west by southwestern Costa Rica. Extending northwestward from Cape Matapalo and Banco Point for 30 miles (50 km), it measures about 15 miles (24 km) from the Osa Peninsula on the west to the mainland on the east. Golfito, the banana port built by the United Fruit Company in the 1930s, and Jim√©nez, the gateway to Corcovado National Park on the Osa Peninsula, are the principal ports on the gulf.
