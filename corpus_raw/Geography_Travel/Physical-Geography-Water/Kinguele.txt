Kinguélé,   waterfall and site of a hydroelectric complex on the Mbei River of Gabon. Kinguélé is situated near Kango and is about 95 miles (150 km) by road east of Libreville, the national capital. There are actually two sets of waterfalls. The upper Kinguélé falls drop a total of 115 feet (35 m) in three consecutive leaps. The larger, lower falls drop 148 feet (45 m). Below the lower falls, the Mbei River continues to rush in cascades for another mile and a half.
The Kinguélé dam and electric-power station, Gabon’s first hydroelectric complex, were constructed (1969–73) at the lower falls by Gabon with assistance from France. Two turbo-alternators began operation in 1973, and a third was added shortly afterward. The complex supplies electrical power for the Gabon Estuary region, including a paper-pulp factory at Kango and the expanding industries of Libreville and Owendo.
