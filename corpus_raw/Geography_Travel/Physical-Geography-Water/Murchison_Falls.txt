Murchison Falls, Murchison also called Kabalega or Kabarega,  waterfall on the lower Victoria Nile River in northwestern Uganda, 20 miles (32 km) east of Lake Albert. The Victoria Nile passes through many miles of rapids before narrowing to a width of about 20 feet (6 metres) and dropping about 400 feet (120 metres) in a series of three cascades. The initial fall of 130 feet (40 metres) is generally recognized as Murchison (Kabalega) Falls. The cataract forms the central feature of the Murchison Falls National Park (established 1952), which occupies an area of 1,483 square miles (3,840 square km) of rolling grassland. The English traveler Sir Samuel White Baker visited the falls in the mid-1860s and named them for the geologist Sir Roderick Murchison.
