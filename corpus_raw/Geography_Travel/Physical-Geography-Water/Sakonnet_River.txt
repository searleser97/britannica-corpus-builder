Sakonnet River,  inlet of the Atlantic Ocean extending approximately 14 miles (23 km) north to Mount Hope Bay, southeastern Rhode Island, U.S. Although called a river, the Sakonnet is actually a saltwater strait that separates Rhode (Aquidneck) Island from the mainland to the east. Sakonnet is an Indian name said to mean “Haunt of the Wild Black Goose.” East of the river’s mouth, at the southern tip of the mainland peninsula, are Sakonnet Point and the resort village of Sakonnet.
