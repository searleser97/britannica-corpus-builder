Alexander Bay,  inlet of the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the Orange River on the extreme northwest coast of Northern Cape province, South Africa. Its mouth is less than 3 miles (5 km) wide and is nearly closed by sandbars, which are widely breached during high floods. The gap in the southern end of the bars is maintained by the outflow of water from the river mouth during low tides and by the tidal inflow at high tides. The town of Alexander Bay, a diamond-mining centre, is located on the inlet.
