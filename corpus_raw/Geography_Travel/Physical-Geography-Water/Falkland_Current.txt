Falkland Current,   branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Southern Hemisphere, flowing northward in the South Atlantic Ocean along the east coast of Argentina to about latitude 30° to 40° S, where it is deflected eastward after meeting the southward-flowing Brazil Current. Characterized by cold temperatures varying from 41° to 66° F (5° to 19° C), the current has a relatively low salinity averaging about 33.5 parts per thousand. Icebergs originating in the Weddell Sea are carried by the Falkland Current approximately as far north as latitude 35° S.
