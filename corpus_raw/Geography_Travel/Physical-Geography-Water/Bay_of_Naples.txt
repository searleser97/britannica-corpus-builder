Bay of Naples, Italian Golfo Di Napoli, Latin Sinus Cumanus,  semicircular inlet of the Tyrrhenian Sea (an arm of the Mediterranean Sea), southwest of the city of Naples, southern Italy. It is 10 miles (16 km) wide and extends southeastward for 20 miles (32 km) from Cape Miseno to Campanella Point. The bay is noted for its scenic beauty, which is enhanced by the steep, mainly volcanic hills surrounding it (including the still-active Mount Vesuvius). The major port is Naples; other coastal towns along the bay are Pozzuoli, Torre Annunziata, Castellammare di Stabia, and Sorrento. Along the bay shore are the extensive ruins of the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. At the bayâ€™s entrance are the islands of Ischia, Procida, and Capri. The Gulf of Pozzuoli is a northwest inlet.
