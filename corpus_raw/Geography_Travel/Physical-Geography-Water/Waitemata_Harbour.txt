Waitematā Harbour,  harbour in northern North Island, New Zealand. The focal point of the Auckland region, it opens into Hauraki Gulf/Tīkapa Moana (east) through Stanley Bay. Its shore has many lesser embayments, containing Island, Soldiers, and Onetaunga bays in the northwest, Herne Bay in the southeast, and Stanley and Freemans bays in the east. Several tidal rivers, including Henderson and Whau creeks, empty into the western part of the harbour. Tidal mudflats covered by mangroves and salt marshes mark its banks. The Auckland Harbour Bridge spans it in the east, linking Auckland on the south with Takapuna on the north.
Deep navigable channels, slow currents, and minimal tidal range all contribute to good berthing facilities for large ships. The harbour also provides a setting for a one-day regatta that draws thousands of people into Auckland annually.
