Oya Current, Japanese Oya-shio, also called Kuril Current,  surface oceanic current flowing southwest along the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kuril Islands. Meeting the Kuro Current Extension east of Japan, part of the cold, less saline water of the Oya Current sinks below the Kuro Current and continues southward; the confluence of these currents is marked by fogbanks. The Oya Current is thought to transport approximately 530,000,000 cubic feet (15,000,000 cubic m) of water per second.
