Gulf of Saint-Malo, French Golfe De Saint-malo,  gulf of the English Channel indenting the north coast of Brittany, France. The Gulf of Saint-Malo extends from the island of Bréhat (west) to the peninsula of Cotentin of Normandy (east). It is 60 miles (100 km) wide from east to west and 20 miles (32 km) long from south to north and receives the Trieux, Rance, Couesnon, and Sélune rivers. The gulf includes the bays of Saint-Brieuc and Mont-Saint-Michel, site of the rocky islet of Le Mont-Saint-Michel, which is famous for its medieval walls and towers and its ancient abbey. At the gulf’s main port, Saint-Malo, tides rise 23 to 26 feet (7 to 8 m) normally and as much as 49 feet (15 m) at spring and autumn tide; thus, at low water an immense tract of land is uncovered. The shore of the gulf is lined with numerous small resorts.
