North Sea Canal, Dutch Noordzeekanaal,  waterway in the Netherlands that extends in an east-west direction between Amsterdam and IJmuiden on the North Sea coast. Its construction was first proposed in 1852; work started in 1865; and the canal opened in 1876. It has been enlarged several times. Navigable by 90,000-ton oceangoing vessels, the canal is 24 km (15 miles) long, 15 metres (49 feet) deep, and 235 metres (771 feet) wide. It gave Amsterdam access to the sea and made it a major port. The sea locks at IJmuiden were destroyed during World War II but were later rebuilt; the largest is now 400 metres (1,300 feet) long by 50 metres (160 feet) wide.
