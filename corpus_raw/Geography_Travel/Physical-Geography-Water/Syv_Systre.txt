Syv Systre, also spelled Sju Søstre, also called Knivsflåfoss,  waterfalls in west-central Norway. The falls have their sources in Geit Mountain. The water flows over a high perpendicular cliff and plunges several hundred feet into Geiranger Fjord below. The name, which in English means “seven sisters,” is derived from the seven separate streams that join at the top of the falls. East of the falls, on a small plateau about 800 feet (240 metres) above the fjord, is the Knivsflå farm, which can be reached only by aerial cable car. The Syv Systre have made Geiranger Fjord a popular tourist attraction.
