Ta√±on Strait,  strait separating the islands of Cebu (east) and Negros (west) in the Philippines. The strait, which is about 100 miles (160 km) long, extends from the Visayan Sea on the north to the Bohol Sea on the south. Its width varies from 3 to 17 miles (5 to 27 km), with the narrowest point in the south. In the north the strait is closed off by the Don Islands, the largest of which is Bantayan. The cities of Bais (Negros) and Toledo (Cebu) have deepwater port facilities.
