California Current,   surface oceanic current, southward-flowing continuation of the Aleutian Current along the west coast of North America between latitudes 48° N and 23° N. The California Current’s surface velocity is commonly less than 10 in. (25 cm) per second, transporting about 390,000,000 cu ft (11,000,000 cu m) of water per second above 3,300 ft (1,000 m).
The temperature and salinity of its waters vary with seasonal variations in upwelling, insolation, and flow. The maximum ranges in temperature and salinity from its northern to its southern end are 48° to 79° F (9° to 26° C) and 32.5 to 34.5 parts per thousand, respectively. During the summer, when upwelling is most dominant, a countercurrent below 650 ft develops close to the coast. The cold upwelling water brings rich nutrients to the surface and abundant plankton and animal life is supported.
