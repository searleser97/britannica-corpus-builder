Samaná Bay, Spanish Bahía de Samaná,  bay located in the northeastern Dominican Republic and lying along the Mona Passage joining the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Bounded on the north by the Samaná Peninsula, the bay measures about 40 miles (65 km) east-west and 15 miles (25 km) north-south. Its well-protected deepwater anchorages make it one of the finest natural harbours in the West Indies. The Yuna River empties into the bay, but only the lower course is navigable. The bay is a fishing and tourist site.
