Storm Bay,  inlet of the Tasman Sea, indenting southeastern Tasmania, Australia. It is about 16 miles (26 km) long and 25 miles (40 km) wide, is bounded by Bruny Island (west) and the Tasman Peninsula (east), and opens into Norfolk and Frederick Henry bays to the northeast. The River Derwent estuary enters the bay from the northwest by way of Hobart. It was named by the Dutch navigator Abel Janszoon Tasman in 1642 when a storm forced his ships out to sea before they could anchor there. The British explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders sailed its waters in 1798â€“99.
