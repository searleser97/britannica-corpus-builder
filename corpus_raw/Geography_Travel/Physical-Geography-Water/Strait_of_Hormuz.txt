Strait of Hormuz, also called Strait of Ormuz,  channel linking the Persian Gulf (west) with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea (southeast). The strait is 35 to 60 miles (55 to 95 km) wide and separates Iran (north) from the Arabian Peninsula (south). It contains the islands of Qeshm (Qishm), Hormuz, and Hengām (Henjām) and is of great strategic and economic importance, especially as oil tankers collecting from various ports on the Persian Gulf must pass through the strait. In the mid-2010s one-fifth of the world’s oil supply passed through the strait, including about one-third of all seaborne trade. The strait also became important for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG), accounting for one-third of all LNG trade in the same period.
