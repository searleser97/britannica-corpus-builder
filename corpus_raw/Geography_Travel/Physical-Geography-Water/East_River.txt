East River,  navigable tidal strait linking Upper New York Bay with Long Island Sound, New York City, U.S. It separates Manhattan Island from Brooklyn and Queens. About 16 miles (26 km) long and 600–4,000 feet (200–1200 metres) wide, it connects with the Hudson River via the Harlem River and Spuyten Duyvil Creek at the north end of Manhattan Island. Roosevelt (formerly Welfare), Wards, Randalls, and Rikers islands are in the East River. The Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, Queensboro, Robert F. Kennedy (formerly called Triborough), Bronx-Whitestone, and Throgs Neck highway bridges and the Hell Gate railroad bridge span it; vehicular, railroad, and subway tunnels also pass under it. Port facilities are on southern portions of the river.
