Gulf of Messenia, Modern Greek Messinía, also called Messiniakós Kólpos, or Gulf of Kalamáta,  gulf of the Ionian Sea (Modern Greek: Ióvio Pélagos) in the nomós (department) of Messenia (Messinía), southwestern Peloponnese (Pelopónnisos), Greece. It is enclosed by the Likódimon Óros (mountain) and Ákra (cape) Akrítas on the west and the Máni peninsula on the east.
The non-navigable Pámisos Potamós (river), rising in the Mínthi Óros of Messenia, empties at the head of the gulf just west of Kalamáta, a manufacturing centre and the second port of the Peloponnese. On the east side of the Akrítas is the port of Koróni (ancient Asine), originally settled by Argives after the First Messenian War (c. 735–c. 715 bce). Reoccupied during the Middle Ages by refugees from the north who gave it the name of their former village, Koróni retains Byzantine, Venetian, and Turkish fortifications. In 1828 the French landed in this gulf during the War of Greek Independence to help clear the Peloponnese of Turks.
