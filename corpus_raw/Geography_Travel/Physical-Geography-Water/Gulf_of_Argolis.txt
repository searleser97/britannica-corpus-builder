Gulf of Argolís, Modern Greek Argolikós Kólpos,  deep inlet of the Mirtóön Sea, a western arm of the Aegean, eastern Peloponnese (Modern Greek: Pelopónnisos), Greece; it is separated from the Gulf of Saronikós by the Argolís peninsula. Some 30 miles (50 km) long and 20 miles (30 km) wide, it includes some small islands off the eastern shore, notably Psilí and Platiá. At the head of the gulf are its principal port, Nauplia (Návplio), and the mouth of the Ínakhos River. Just north of the head of the gulf is Árgos, an important Mycenaean and Dorian centre continuously occupied since the Early Bronze Age (c. 3500 bce). At the entrance to the gulf is the island of Spétsai, an Athenian summer resort.
