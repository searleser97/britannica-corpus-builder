Bay of Plenty,  bay of the South Pacific Ocean, eastern North Island, New Zealand. About 100 miles (160 km) wide, it extends along a narrow lowland strip from Waihi Beach eastward to Opotiki. The Rangitaiki and Whakatane rivers empty into the bay, the largest islands of which are White and Motiti. Matakana Island shelters Tauranga Harbour to the west.
The Bay of Plenty was named in 1769 by Captain James Cook, in recognition of the generous provisions and water received from Maoris living along its shore. Principal settlements are Mount Maunganui, Maketu, Matata, Whakatane, and Opotiki. The region supports dairy and sheep farming.
