Western Schelde, Schelde also spelled Scheldt, Dutch Westerschelde,  estuary, flowing westward for about 30 miles (50 km) through the Delta Islands in the southwestern Netherlands to the North Sea. The former islands of Walcheren and Zuid-Beveland (now a peninsula) are located to the north of the estuary. The Zeeuws Vlaanderen region, consisting mainly of land that was reclaimed during the 16th and 17th centuries, lies to the south. The Western Schelde is formed in the east where the Schelde River enters the Netherlands from Belgium. It has been an important transportation route since the 16th century, when the Holy Roman emperor Charles V designated Vlissingen (on Walcheren) as his port of embarkation from the Netherlands. Unlike inlets to the north, the Western Schelde continues to be kept open to the North Sea as an important and very crowded shipping route to Antwerp, Belg., and destinations on canalized waterways farther north, south, and east. Dikes built along most of the coastline prevent flooding. The estuary is not bridged; ferry services operate between Vlissingen and Breskens and between Perkpolder and Kruiningen.
