Antarctic Circumpolar Current, also called ACC or West Wind Drift,  wind-driven surface oceanic current encircling Antarctica and flowing from west to east. Affected by adjacent landmasses, submarine topography, and prevailing winds, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is irregular in width and course. Its motion is further complicated by continuous exchange with other water masses at all depths. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current separates the Southern Ocean from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans at 60° S latitude, which roughly coincides with the current’s southern boundary.
The Antarctic Circumpolar Current spans 8° of latitude or more, and its course varies slightly by location. In the Pacific and Indian oceans, its northern boundary occurs between latitudes 48° S and 58° S, and its southern extreme approaches 70° S, near the coast of Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica. In the Atlantic Ocean, its northern boundary fluctuates between latitudes 42° S and 48° S, whereas its southern boundary occurs at about 60° S. Its mean transport is estimated at 134 sverdrup (or 134 million cubic metres [about 4.7 billion cubic feet] per second); however, studies have estimated the current’s flow through the Drake Passage as high as 173.3 sverdrup (or 173.3 million cubic metres [about 6.1 billion cubic feet] per second).
