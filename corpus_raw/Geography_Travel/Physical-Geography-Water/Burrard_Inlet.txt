Burrard Inlet,   eastern arm of the Strait of Georgia, extending 23 miles (37 km) in an easterly direction into southeastern British Columbia, Canada. It varies from 1 to 4 miles in width and forms Vancouver Harbour, one of the best natural harbours on the Pacific coast of North America. Vancouver lies on its south shore, North Vancouver on its north, and Port Moody and Ioco near its eastern end. The inlet was explored in 1792 by the British navigator George Vancouver and was named for Sir Harry Burrard, who had served with him in the West Indies in 1785.
