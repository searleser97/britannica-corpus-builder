Kongs Fjord, Norwegian Kongsfjorden,  inlet, Spitsbergen island (Norway), Arctic Ocean. Kongs Fjord is an arm of the Arctic Ocean measuring 16 miles (26 km) long and ranging in width from 4 to 9 miles (6 to 14 km). The head of the bay (southeast) receives the waters of the Kongsvegen glacier.
Ny-Ålesund is located on the inlet’s southern shore; it was once a coal-mining town but was developed as a centre for Arctic research by the University of Tromsø beginning in the early 21st century. Kongs Fjord has been a base for a number of polar flights, including that of Richard E. Byrd (U.S.) with Floyd Bennett (U.S.) and that of Roald Amundsen (Norwegian) with Umberto Nobile (Italian), both in 1926.
