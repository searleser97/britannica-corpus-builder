West Australian Current,   relatively cold surface current of the southeast Indian Ocean, part of the general counterclockwise movement in the southern section of that ocean. As the South Indian Current (part of the West Wind Drift) approaches the west coast of Australia, it turns north to parallel that coast as the West Australian Current. The current, which is much affected by winds, is weak during the winter and strong during the summer, attaining velocities of 20–35 cm (8–14 inches) per second. The flow dissipates by sending some of its water northwest to join the Indian South Equatorial Current and the remainder northeast into the Timor Sea.
