Kangerlussuaq, Danish Søndre Strømfjord,  fjord in southwestern Greenland, located just north of the Arctic Circle and 60 miles (95 km) southeast of Sisimiut (Holsteinsborg). About 120 miles (190 km) long and 1–5 miles (1.5–8 km) wide, the fjord extends northeastward from Davis Strait to the edge of the inland ice cap, where its arms are fed by several glaciers. Near the head of the fjord is the town of Kangerlussuaq, the site of Greenland’s main international airport. Established as Bluie West 8 (BW 8), a U.S. World War II air base, the airport served for many years as a transpolar intermediate stop between Scandinavia and North America. It was abandoned as a U.S. base in 1992 and taken over by Greenland’s home rule government. The town is also a centre for tourism and scientific activities.
