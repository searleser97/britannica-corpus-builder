Gulf of Laconia, Modern Greek Lakonía Kólpos, also called Lakonikós,  large, deep gulf on the southern Ionian Sea (Modern Greek: Ióvio Pélagos) embraced by the two southernmost peninsulas of the Peloponnese (Pelopónnisos), Greece, 35 miles (56 km) north-south and 30 miles (48 km) wide. Cape Maléa, which divides the Gulf of Laconia from the Aegean Sea, was once feared by sailors for its treacherous winds and harbourless coast. The surrounding region lies entirely within Laconia nomós (department). The major stream entering is the non-navigable Evrótas River, which rises in the Taïyetos (Táygetos) range. Two promontories on the western shore form the Skoútari and Kolokithiás inlets, the latter fronting the port of Kótronas. The small island of Elafónisos is separated on the south by a channel from Cythera (Kýthira), an Ionian island.
