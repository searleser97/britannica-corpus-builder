Uummannaq Fjord, Uummannaq also spelled Umanak,  inlet of Baffin Bay, western Greenland, north of Nuussuaq Peninsula. About 100 miles (160 km) long and 15–30 miles (24–48 km) wide, the inlet divides into several smaller fjords extending eastward to the inland ice cap, where they are fed by extensive glaciers. Upernivik and Ubekendt islands separate the inlet from Karrat Isfjord; Qarajaqs Isfjord is its most southerly arm. The town of Uummannaq (founded 1763) is on a small island just north of Nuussuaq Peninsula. It has been a hunting and fishing base for centuries and now serves as a municipal centre. Fishing and fish processing contribute to the economy. Nearby is Maarmorilik, a 20th-century mining site, originally established for marble production, that produced lead, zinc, and silver.
