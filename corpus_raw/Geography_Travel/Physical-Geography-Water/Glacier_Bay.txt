Glacier Bay,  scenic indentation, about 50 miles (80 km) long, on the coast of southeastern Alaska, U.S. Situated about 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Juneau, it contains a spectacular display of glaciers that descend from the lofty ice-draped St. Elias Range in the east and the Fairweather Range in the west. Most of the several dozen glaciers in the area are terrestrial, but a handful are classified as tidewater (i.e., those that flow directly into the ocean). The bay, which is studded with many largely treeless islands that are used as rookeries by thousands of seabirds, has fjordlike inlets that terminate at ice cliffs or sheer faces of the glaciers. Muir Glacier, formerly the most famous of the tidewater glaciers, once rose 265 feet (81 metres) above the water and was nearly 2 miles (3 km) wide; it has shrunk and receded and no longer reaches the sea. Johns Hopkins Glacier is now the largest tidewater glacier in the region. Glacier Bay was the descriptive name given to the striking locality by Captain Lester A. Beardslee of the U.S. Navy in 1880. The bay is the focus of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.
