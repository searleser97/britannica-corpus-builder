Poverty Bay,   inlet of the southern Pacific Ocean, bounded by eastern North Island, New Zealand. The town of Gisborne is situated on its northern shore.
Poverty Bay is 6 miles (10 km) long and 4 miles (6 km) wide. Named by Captain James Cook, it is the site of the explorerâ€™s first landing (1769) in New Zealand. The botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, who sailed with Cook on the Endeavour, participated in the historic landing and collected, drew, and described a great number of plants found in the Poverty Bay region. In addition to the Primitive Florae Novae Zelandiae (never published), Banks wrote detailed descriptions of the appearance of the Maoris who were encountered at Poverty Bay. Some Maori lives were lost in the encounter. The Poverty Bay area was also the site of warfare in the mid-1800s, when the Maoris resisted European attempts to appropriate Maori lands.
