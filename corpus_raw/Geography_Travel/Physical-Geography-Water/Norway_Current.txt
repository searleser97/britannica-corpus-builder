Norway Current,   branch of the North Atlantic Current, sometimes considered a continuation of the Gulf Stream (issuing from the Gulf of Mexico). The Norway Current enters the Norwegian Sea north of Scotland and flows northeastward along the coast of Norway before flowing into the Barents Sea. With subsurface temperatures ranging from 46째 F (8째 C) in the south to about 39째 F (4째 C) in the north, the current exerts a moderating influence on the climate of Norway and northern Europe. The main flow of water reaches a velocity of about 0.5 knot and is dispersed westward in eddies that meet those of the southwest-flowing East Greenland Current. This thermal mixing of the water creates excellent fishing grounds, especially around coastal regions of the Faroe and Shetland islands and of Norway.
