Folda,  fjord, northern Norway. The fjord’s mouth opens into Vest Fjord of the Norwegian Sea and is 25 miles (40 km) northeast of the town of Bodø and about 75 miles (120 km) north of the Arctic Circle. The Folda extends two branches inland: the Nordfolda, 25 miles (40 km) long, and the Sørfolda, 18 miles (29 km) in length. Each is dotted with small fishing villages; herring is the main catch. The heads of both branches are crossed by the North Cape (Nordkapp) Highway connecting the coastal counties north of the fjord with the more densely settled portion of the country to the south.
