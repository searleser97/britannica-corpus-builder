Makassar Strait, also spelled Macassar Strait, Indonesian Selat Makassar,  narrow passage of the west-central Pacific Ocean, Indonesia. Extending 500 miles (800 km) northeastâ€“southwest from the Celebes Sea to the Java Sea, the strait passes between Borneo on the west and Celebes on the east and is 80 to 230 miles (130 to 370 km) wide. It is a deep waterway containing numerous islands, the largest of which are Laut Island and Sebuku. Balikpapan is the principal settlement along the strait on Borneo, and Makassar (Ujungpandang) is the largest on Celebes. In January 1942, during World War II, combined U.S. and Dutch military forces engaged a Japanese naval expedition in the strait. In five days of fighting, the Allies were unable to prevent a Japanese landing at Balikpapan, the first step taken in the occupation of Dutch Borneo.
