Mozambique Current,   relatively warm surface current of the western Indian Ocean. The southeast trade winds move the Indian South Equatorial Current toward the east coast of Africa, off which, because of the Earthâ€™s rotation, it is directed south to follow the outline of the mainland and its continental shelf. While some of this flow passes east of the island of Madagascar, the rest funnels to the west through the Mozambique Channel, bringing with it strong influences on the climate of the island and mainland. South of Madagascar both streams feed into the Agulhas Current.
