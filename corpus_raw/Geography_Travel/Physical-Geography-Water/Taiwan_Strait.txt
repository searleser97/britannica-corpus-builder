Taiwan Strait, also called Formosa Strait, Chinese (Wade-Giles romanization) T’ai-wan Hai-hsia or (Pinyin) Taiwan Haixia,  arm of the Pacific Ocean, 100 miles (160 km) wide at its narrowest point, lying between the coast of China’s Fukien province and the island of Taiwan (Formosa). The strait extends from southwest to northeast between the South and East China seas. It reaches a depth of about 230 feet (70 m) and contains the Pescadores Islands (which are controlled by the government of Taiwan). The chief ports are Amoy in mainland China and Kao-hsiung on Taiwan. The area lies in a typhoon zone.
The strait was named Formosa (“Beautiful”) by Portuguese navigators in the late 16th century; although it is still known in the West by its European name, the Chinese and now most Westerners use the name Taiwan Strait.
