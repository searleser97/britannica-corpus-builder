Amatique Bay, Spanish Bahía de Amatique,  inlet of the Gulf of Honduras in the Caribbean Sea, indenting eastern Guatemala and southeastern Belize. Extending northwestward for about 40 miles (64 km) from Santo Tomás de Castilla, it is some 15 miles (24 km) from northeast to southwest. Three rivers empty into Amatique Bay: the Dulce River, which drains Izabal Lake; the Sarstoon (Sarstún) River, which forms the Belize-Guatemala border; and, in the northwest, the Moho River. The bay’s principal ports are Puerto Barrios, Santo Tomás de Castilla, and Livingston, in Guatemala; and Punta Gorda, in Belize.
