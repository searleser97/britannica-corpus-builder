Gulf of Nicoya, Spanish Golfo de Nicoya,  inlet that indents the west-central part of the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The inlet extends northward and northwestward from Cape Blanco (Cabo Blanco) for about 50 miles (80 km). Cape Blanco, on the Nicoya Peninsula, is about 25 miles (40 km) from the mainland, but the gulf narrows to a width of approximately 15 miles (24 km) farther northward. The Tempisque, Abangares, and TÃ¡rcoles rivers empty into the gulf. It has several islands, most notably Chira, the largest, and San Lucas, the site of a prison until 1991. The largest town and port of the many settlements on the shores of the gulf is Puntarenas, on the mainland.
