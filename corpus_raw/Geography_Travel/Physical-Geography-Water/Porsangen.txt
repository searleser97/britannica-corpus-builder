Porsangen,  fjord, indenting the coast of extreme northern Norway on the Arctic Ocean. An inlet of the Barents Sea, the fjord is approximately 80 miles (130 km) long and lies well north of the Arctic Circle. Adjacent to the mouth of the fjord is a largely uninhabited area, Sværholtklubben, which serves as home to thousands of seabirds. Many islands are found in Porsangen. Magerøya (island), just west of the mouth, contains North Cape (Nordkapp) and the northernmost point in Europe; a tunnel under Magerøy Sound leads to the island. The region around Porsangen is sparsely populated; Kistrand, Banak, Lakselv, and Børselv are the main villages. All are located along the southern shores. There is an airport at Banak. Fishing and reindeer herding are the major activities of the Sami people who live in the region. Norwegians and descendants of Finnish immigrants (Kvens) also live there.
