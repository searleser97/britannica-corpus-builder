Kaipara Harbour,   inlet of the Tasman Sea indenting northwestern North Island, New Zealand. It is the largest drowned river system of the North Auckland Peninsula and was formed when the sea flooded the lower valleys of the Wairoa, Kaipara, Hoteo, and other rivers. Connected to the open sea by a passage 5 miles (8 km) wide, the interior of the broad, shallow harbour—200 square miles (520 square km) in area—has many narrow extensions and more than 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of shoreline. The harbour served as an important port before roads and rail lines were built in the area. Major settlements on the inlet are Helensville, Ruawai, and Paparoa.
