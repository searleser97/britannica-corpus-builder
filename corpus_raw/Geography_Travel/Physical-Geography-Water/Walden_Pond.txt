Walden Pond,  small pond (about 64 acres [26 hectares]) in Concord town (township), Middlesex county, eastern Massachusetts, U.S. It lies just south of the village of Concord in Walden Pond State Reservation (304 acres [123 hectares]). The pond was immortalized by Henry David Thoreau, who retreated there (1845–47) from society prior to writing Walden; or, Life in the Woods. In “Where I Lived, and What I Lived For,” the second chapter of the book, Thoreau wrote:
The spot by the north shore on which Thoreau’s cabin stood is marked with a cairn and nine stone posts indicating the walls of the cabin. Travelers to the site, including Walt Whitman, paid homage to Thoreau by laying stones on the cairn. For a discussion of Thoreau’s stay at Walden, see Thoreau, Henry David: Move to Walden Pond.
