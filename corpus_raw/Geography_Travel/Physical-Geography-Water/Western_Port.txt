Western Port,   circular bay, about 20 miles (32 km) across, indenting the south coast of Victoria, Australia, southeast of Melbourne. An inlet of Bass Strait, it is separated from Port Phillip Bay (12 miles [19 km] west) by Mornington Peninsula. Phillip Island (40 square miles [100 square km]) lies at its entrance flanked by passages on the west and east, the latter, narrower one being bridged to the mainland. French Island (84 square miles [218 square km]) fills much of the bay’s interior. The discovery of large deposits of oil and natural gas off the Gippsland coast in the 1960s has led to the development of the Western Port area as a zone of heavy industry. The inlet was named by George Bass, the English explorer, because it was the most westerly point reached by his expedition (1798). At one time all of the Victorian coast between Wilson’s Promontory and Port Phillip Bay was known as Western Port.
