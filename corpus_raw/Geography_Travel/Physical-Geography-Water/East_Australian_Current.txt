East Australian Current,  surface oceanic current, a section of the counterclockwise flow in the Tasman Sea, southwestern Pacific Ocean. It is formed by water masses from the Coral Sea—equatorial water driven by monsoonal winds from January to March and eastward subtropical flow from April to December—which pass southeast between the Great Barrier and Chesterfield reefs (20° S latitude), paralleling the east coast of Australia into the Tasman Sea. Narrowing as it approaches 25° S latitude, the current is strongest off Cape Byron, northern New South Wales. It weakens and begins to dissipate beyond 32° S latitude, but its remnants continue to drift southward until, off Tasmania, they swing eastward and begin to flow north as the Tasman Current. At the surface its salinity is more than 35 parts per thousand, increasing to a maximum of 35.8 at a depth of 660 feet (200 metres). Reaching depths greater than 3,300 feet (1,000 metres), the East Australian Current transports about 1,100 million cubic feet (30 million cubic metres) of water per second.
