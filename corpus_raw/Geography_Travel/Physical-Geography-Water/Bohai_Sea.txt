Bohai Sea, also called Bo Hai, Wade-Giles romanization Po Hai, also called Gulf of Chihli,  gulf, shallow northwestern arm of the Yellow Sea, off the northern coast of China. It is enclosed by the Liaodong Peninsula (northeast) and the Shandong Peninsula (south). Liaodong Bay to the northeast and Laizhou Bay to the south are generally considered part of Bohai Sea. Within these limits, the gulf’s maximum dimensions are 300 miles (480 km) from northeast to southwest and 190 miles (306 km) from east to west. Bohai Haixia, the strait leading to the gulf,  is about 65 miles (105 km) in width. The Huang He (Yellow River), China’s second longest river, discharges into the gulf. The gulf has long been a source of prawns and salt. There are both onshore and offshore petroleum deposits, and several oil refineries are located there as well as other industries. Bohai Sea has experienced high levels of pollution, although efforts to combat it, particularly those begun in the late 2010s, have garnered some success.
