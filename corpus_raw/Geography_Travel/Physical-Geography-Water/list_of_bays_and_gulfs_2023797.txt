 Bays and gulfs are concavities formed by tidal erosion in the coastline of an ocean, lake, or sea. The difference between a bay and a gulf is not clearly defined, but the term bay usually refers to a body of water somewhat smaller than a gulf. Numerous exceptions, however, are found throughout the world, such as the Bay of Bengal, which is larger than the Gulf of Mexico and about the same size as the Arabian Sea. This is a list of bays and gulfs, ordered alphabetically by continent or region and by country. Fjords—deep, glacially formed inlets—are also included. (See also list of fjords.)
