Big Sur,  scenic region in western California, U.S., that comprises a 100-mile- (160-km-) long ruggedly beautiful stretch of seacoast along the Pacific Ocean. It extends southward from Carmel, just south of Monterey (whence the name El Sur Grande: “The Big South”), to the Hearst Castle at San Simeon.
A winding, narrow, mountainous coastal road affords some spectacular views of the Pacific and the wayside wilderness areas of Los Padres National Forest. Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, with diverse wildlife and some 800 acres (325 hectares) of coastal redwood and chaparral, contains the village of Big Sur, some 30 miles (50 km) south of Monterey, and borders the Big Sur River, a short stream in the Santa Lucia Range. The area contains other state parks, including Garrapata, Andrew Molera, and San Simeon, and Point Sur State Historic Park.
The area, now popular with tourists and naturalists, was once a wilderness dotted with cattle ranches and small farms; electricity did not reach it until the mid-1950s. The splendour of its scenery and the loneliness of its 19th-century homesteaders have been interpreted by Robinson Jeffers in poems such as Women at Point Sur (1927). The poet’s home (which he built of local rock and stone) is one of the Big Sur’s landmarks. Many other writers, among them Henry Miller and Jack Kerouac, lived in the region and celebrated it in their work. In the mid-1980s a comprehensive zoning plan was adopted by Monterey county authorities that strictly limited commercial development along a 68-mile (109-km) stretch of Big Sur’s twisting and mountainous shoreline.
