Sint Anna Bay, English Santa Anna Bay, Dutch Sint Anna Baai,  deep channel separating the two parts of Willemstad, capital of Curaçao. The bay is a narrow waterway, about 1 mile (1.6 km) long and 300 to 1,000 feet (90 to 300 metres) wide. The south end opens into the Caribbean Sea, and the north end opens up into the Schottegat—a giant, deep lagoon that serves as a harbour and seaplane anchorage. Spanning Sint Anna Bay is the Koningin Emma (“Queen Emma”) Bridge, a pontoon bridge linking the two parts of the city. A newer fixed bridge vaults 160 feet (50 metres) high over the bay and contains a four-lane highway.
