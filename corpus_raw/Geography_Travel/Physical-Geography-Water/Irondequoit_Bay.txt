Irondequoit Bay,  inlet of Lake Ontario in western New York state, U.S., just northeast of Rochester. It is 4 miles (6 km) long and 0.5 to 1 mile (0.8 to 1.6 km) wide. A channel connects with Lake Ontario at the northeastern end of the bay. The Irondequoit Creek enters the bay from the south, and the town of Irondequoit lies along the west shore.
