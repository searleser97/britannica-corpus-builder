Agulhas Current,  surface oceanic current that forms the western boundary current of the southern Indian Ocean. It flows southward along the southeast coast of Mozambique and the coast of South Africa before turning eastward to join the flow from Africa to Australia. A small part of Agulhas water apparently continues westward around the Cape of Good Hope into the Atlantic Ocean. The Mozambique Current, between Madagascar and Africa, also feeds the Agulhas Current.
Only 60 miles (100 km) wide, the Agulhas Current is estimated to flow at an average rate of 0.5 to 1.4 miles (0.8 to 2.2 km) per hour. Its velocity depends on variations in the equatorial current velocity, which in turn change with location, depth, and season. One of the fastest-flowing currents in any ocean, it reaches an estimated top speed of 5.8 miles (9.3 km) per hour off the southeast coast of South Africa. Because it is fed from lower latitudes, the Agulhas Current is warm, ranging in temperature from 57 to 79 °F (14 to 26 °C) at the surface. The average temperature is lower in southern sections near Antarctica. The Agulhas is noted as a major western boundary current in the Southern Hemisphere.
