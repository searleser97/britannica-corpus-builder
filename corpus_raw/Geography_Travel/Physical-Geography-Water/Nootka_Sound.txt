Nootka Sound,   an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, on the western coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, some 168 miles (270 km) northwest of Victoria. The sound, which forms a good harbour, is 6 miles (10 km) wide and has three arms, one of which separates Nootka Island from Vancouver Island.
Captain James Cook visited the sound in 1778. He called it King Georgeâ€™s Sound, then renamed it Nootka Sound, believing that to be its Indian name.
