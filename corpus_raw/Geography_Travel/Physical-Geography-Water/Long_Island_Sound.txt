Long Island Sound,   semienclosed arm of the North Atlantic Ocean, lying between the New York–Connecticut (U.S.) shore to the north and Long Island to the south. Covering 1,180 square miles (3,056 square km), it is 90 miles (145 km) long and 3–20 miles (5–32 km) wide and is limited on the east by Orient Point (Long Island) and Plum, Gull, and Fishers islands and on the west by the narrow Throgs Neck, which leads into Upper New York Bay via the East River. Two glacial advances have deepened the sound’s water to more than 100 feet (30 m); near its eastern limits it reaches a maximum depth of 330 feet (100 m). The mean tidal range is from less than 3 feet (1 m) in its eastern reaches to more than 6 feet (about 2 m) in the west. The sound’s drainage basin is nearly 13 times its area, and the annual volume of incoming fresh water is about 35 percent of the total. Most of the drainage of the Housatonic, Connecticut, and Thames rivers flows out rapidly through the open eastern end of the sound and thus has little effect on the salinity. The sound’s waters are rich in plankton and bottom-dwelling organisms, making it favourable for young fish but deterring most commercially valuable fish. Except for menhaden processed for fish meal, the sound alone does not support an important fishery. The major sport fishing is for weakfish and bluefish. Lobsters, crabs, and clams are caught along the Connecticut shores, and oyster farms are found from Bridgeport, Conn., eastward. The sound is part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, and around its shores are many residential communities and yachting resorts.
