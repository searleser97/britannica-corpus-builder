New York State Canal System, formerly (1918â€“92) New York State Barge Canal, or Barge Canal,  system of state-owned, state-operated waterways, 524 miles (843 km) in length, linking the Hudson River with Lake Erie, with extensions to Lakes Ontario and Champlain and Cayuga and Seneca lakes (in the Finger Lakes region). It incorporates the Erie Canal, from Troy via Rochester to Tonawanda, north of Buffalo; the Champlain Canal, which joins the Erie Canal at Waterford and extends north to Whitehall; the Oswego Canal, which connects the Erie Canal at Three Rivers (just north of Syracuse) and enters Lake Ontario at Oswego; and Cayuga and Seneca lakes, connecting these at Montezuma with the Erie Canal. It can accommodate barges 300 feet (91 metres) long, 43.5 feet (13 metres) wide, with a draft of 12 feet (3.7 metres) and a cargo capacity of 2,200 tons (2,000 metric tons). Authorized in 1903, it was completed in 1918. By the 1980s commercial shipping had declined because of the increased use of pipeline, rail, and bulk truck-carrying facilities. The canal system has, however, become popular for pleasure boating.
