Denmark Strait, also called the Strait,  channel partially within the Arctic Circle, lying between Greenland (west) and Iceland (east). About 180 miles (290 km) wide at its narrowest point, the strait extends southward for 300 miles (483 km) from the Greenland Sea to the open waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The cold East Greenland Current flows southward along the west side of the strait and carries icebergs, which originate in the Arctic Ocean and on the Greenland ice cap; a branch of the warmer Irminger Current flows northward near the Iceland coast. The channel has been known as the Denmark Strait since at least the late 19th century.
