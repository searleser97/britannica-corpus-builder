Tasermiut,  fjord in southern Greenland, extending northeasterly from its mouth and the nearby town of Nanortalik on the Atlantic Ocean to the inland ice cap. It is 45 miles (70 km) long and 1–3 miles wide. In the 10th century, Tasermiut (Ketilsfjord) was the site of Norse settlements, notably Vatsdalr (Vazdalr) and Vík in Ketilsfjord (Ároskirkja in Ivar), where an Augustinian monastery was located.
