Zoigê Marsh, Chinese (Pinyin) Ruo’ergai Zhaoze or (Wade-Giles romanization) Jo-erh-kai Chao-tse, also called Songpan Grasslands,  large marsh lying mostly in northern Sichuan province, west-central China. It occupies about 1,000 square miles (2,600 square km) of the eastern part of the Plateau of Tibet at an elevation of 11,800 feet (3,600 metres) above sea level and extends westward across the border of Sichuan into southern Gansu and southeastern Qinghai provinces. The marsh, formed by abundant rain and snow, lies in a region of restricted drainage with a long frost period (fewer than 20 frost-free days annually). It is bordered on the east by the Min Mountains and on the west by the A’nyêmaqên (Amne Machin) Mountains; the Huang He (Yellow River) runs through the western part of the region from south to north. Beneath its uneven surface lies a layer of peat generally 7–10 feet (2–3 metres) thick but increasing to as much as 20–23 feet (6–7 metres) deep in some places. Crossed by the Chinese communists during the Long March (1934–35), the region was then a marshy wilderness area. In the 1970s ditches were dug, parts of the marsh were drained, and cattle, sheep, and horses pastured on the reclaimed grasslands. A nature preserve was established in the area in 1994; it is home to the chital, or spotted deer, and the black-necked crane.
