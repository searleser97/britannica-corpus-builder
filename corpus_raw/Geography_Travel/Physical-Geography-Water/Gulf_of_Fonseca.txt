Gulf of Fonseca, Spanish Golfo de Fonseca,  sheltered inlet of the Pacific Ocean, bounded northwest by El Salvador, northeast by Honduras, and southeast by Nicaragua. Discovered in 1522, it reaches inland for approximately 40 miles (65 km) and covers an area of about 700 square miles (1,800 square km). Its entrance, marked by Cape Amapala in El Salvador and Cape Cosigüina in Nicaragua, is about 20 miles (32 km) across, but widens to approximately 50 miles (80 km). The gulf is fed by the Goascorán, Choluteca, and Negro rivers of Honduras and the Estero Real River of Nicaragua. The gulf’s shores are covered with mangrove swamps, except in the west, where Conchagua Volcano in El Salvador rises sharply from the shore. Notable among the islands in the gulf are Zacate Grande, El Tigre, and Meanguera. The main ports are La Unión in El Salvador, Amapala on Isla del Tigre in Honduras, and Puerto Morazán (upstream on the Estero Real) in Nicaragua.
