Greenland Current,   surface oceanic current, a combination of polar sea surface drift, return flow of the North Atlantic Current, and Irminger Current waters. The East Greenland Current flows south along Greenlandâ€™s east coast, transporting large fields of ice, and then turns north into the Labrador Sea. The current mixes with the warmer Irminger and Norwegian currents, creating excellent fishing grounds near the coast of Iceland and in portions of the Norwegian Sea. At the southern extremity of Greenland (Cape Farewell), a branch turns to form the West Greenland Current, which flows north along the west coast of Greenland into the Davis Strait, where it joins the Labrador Current. Salinity and temperature increase outward from the Greenland coast. In contrast to the east coast of Greenland, the west coast is kept free of ice by warm North Atlantic waters that contribute to the current beyond the slope.
