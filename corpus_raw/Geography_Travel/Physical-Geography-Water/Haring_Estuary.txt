Haring Estuary, Dutch Haringvliet,  freshwater channel, southwestern Netherlands. A distributary of the Hollands Diep, it ultimately (through other streams) has its origin in the Lower Rhine (Neder Rijn) River. The Haring flows for about 20 miles (32 km) between the joined islands of Voorne and Putten and the island of Beijerland to the north and the joined islands of Goeree and Overflakkee to the south. It discharges into the North Sea. Its low shores were devastated during the disastrous tidal surge floods of February 1953. As part of the Delta Plan for land reclamation and both Rhine and tidal flood protection, a dam with numerous sluices was completed at the Haringâ€™s mouth in 1970. A large lock built as part of the Haring Dam allows the channel to remain open to shipping.
