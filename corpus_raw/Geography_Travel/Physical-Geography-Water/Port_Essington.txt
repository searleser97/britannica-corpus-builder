Port Essington,  inlet of the Arafura Sea, indenting the north shore of the Cobourg Peninsula, at the extreme north of the Northern Territory, Australia. About 19 miles (30 km) long and 7 miles (11 km) wide, it was surveyed in 1818 by Captain Phillip Parker King of the Royal Navy, who named it for Admiral Sir William Essington. In 1824 it was the site of Britainâ€™s third attempt to settle the north coast of Australia. The attempt failed, and the settlement, named Victoria, survived only from 1838 until 1849. Relics of the settlement are preserved in the Cobourg Marine Park. Cultured pearl farming is carried on in the inlet and other bays of the Cobourg Peninsula.
