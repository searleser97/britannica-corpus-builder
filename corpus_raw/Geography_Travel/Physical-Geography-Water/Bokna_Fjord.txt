Bokna Fjord, Norwegian Boknafjorden,  inlet of the North Sea in southwestern Norway. At its mouth, between the southern tip of Karm Island and the northern tip of the Tungenes Peninsula, it is 12 miles (20 km) wide. Bokna Fjord proper extends inland for about 28 miles (45 km). Its principal branches include Skjold Fjord and Sandeid Fjord to the north, Sauda Fjord and Hyls Fjord to the northeast, and Lyse Fjord and Høgs Fjord to the southeast. It is dotted by many islands and islets. Among the more important are the Kvits Islands, in the centre of the fjord’s entrance; Bokn, inside the north entrance; Finn and Rennes islands, in the middle of the fjord; and Ombo, near its head. The city of Stavanger is the only large settlement along Bokna Fjord.
