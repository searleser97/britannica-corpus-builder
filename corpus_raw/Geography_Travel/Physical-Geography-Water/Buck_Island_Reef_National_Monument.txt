Buck Island Reef National Monument,  tropical marine park in the northeastern Caribbean Sea. It is located off the northern coast of St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. Established in 1961 and significantly expanded in 2001, it covers approximately 30 square miles (78 square km), completely encompassing Buck Island and its surrounding waters and coral reefs. A barrier reef formed of elkhorn coral around part of the island offers beautiful coral formations, sea fans, grottoes, gorgonians, and a variety of colourful tropical fish.
For some two centuries beginning in the 1750s, the island served as pastureland for goats. Tree cutting and overgrazing cleared the land of vegetation, but the goats were removed in the 1950s and the natural species were allowed to grow back. The mongoose, introduced to curb the island’s rat population, now preys on native reptiles and birds. The monument is accessible only by boat. There is an underwater trail for snorkeling and scuba diving, the main activities. Buck Island has white sand beaches and a land-based nature trail. It provides habitat for frigate birds, least terns, and endangered hawksbill sea turtles and brown pelicans.
In 2001, 28.3 square miles (73.3 square km) were added to the monument’s original 1.4 square miles (3.6 square km). The enlarged area, in which fishing was discontinued, allowed depleted fish stocks and damaged reefs to recover, in addition to expanding the types of marine environments protected.
Christiansted National Historic Site is nearby on St. Croix; its 27 acres (11 hectares) were set aside in 1952 to preserve historic colonial-era buildings. Virgin Islands National Park covers much of St. John, about 40 miles (65 km) to the north.
