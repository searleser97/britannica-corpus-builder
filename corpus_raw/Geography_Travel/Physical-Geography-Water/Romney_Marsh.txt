Romney Marsh,  extensive tract of flat land with an area of about 25,000 acres (about 10,000 hectares) bordering the English Channel in Shepway district in the administrative and historic county of Kent, England. It extends from Hythe in the north to the Dungeness promontory in the south. It has emerged from the sea since Roman times, partly by natural accretion and partly by dyking and reclamation. This marshland possesses some of the finest grazing land in Britain. Romney Marsh sheep, a long-wool variety, have earned worldwide renown and are especially important in Australia and New Zealand. The Romney, Hythe, and Dymchurch narrow-gauge railway attracts many visitors.
