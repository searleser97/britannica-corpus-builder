Straits of Florida,  passage connecting the Gulf of Mexico with the Atlantic Ocean. It is about 93 miles (150 km) at its narrowest width, between the Florida Keys, U.S., on the north and Cuba on the south, and it extends east to The Bahamas. The straits mark the area where the Florida Current, the initial part of the Gulf Stream, flows eastward out of the Gulf of Mexico with a mean surface velocity of 4 to 6 miles (6.5 to 9.5 km) per hour. The Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le√≥n first recorded sailing through the straits in 1513.
