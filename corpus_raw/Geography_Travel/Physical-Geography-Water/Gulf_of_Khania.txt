Gulf of Khaniá, Modern Greek Kólpos Khaníon,  gulf on the northwestern coast of Crete (Modern Greek: Kríti), Greece. It is enclosed on the west by the north-south Rodhopós Peninsula, which rises to 2,454 feet (748 m) in Mount Títiron, and on the east by the mushroom-shaped Akrotíri Peninsula. The well-defined gulf is some 19 miles (30 km) wide between the tips of its confining peninsulas and has depths up to 650 feet (200 m). At the base of the Akrotíri Peninsula is Khaniá, site of ancient Kydonia and now the principal settlement on the bay. Just offshore is the small island of Áyios Theódhoros.
