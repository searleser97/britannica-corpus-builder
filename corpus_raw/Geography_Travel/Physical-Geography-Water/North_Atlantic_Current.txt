North Atlantic Current, also called North Atlantic Drift,  part of a clockwise-setting ocean-current system in the North Atlantic Ocean, extending from southeast of the Grand Bank, off Newfoundland, Canada, to the Norwegian Sea, off northwestern Europe. It constitutes the northeastward extension of the Gulf Stream; the latter issues from the Gulf of Mexico and gradually emerges as the North Atlantic Current in mid-ocean. It is composed of several broad currents with speeds of about 0.2 knots, as compared with the Gulf Streamâ€™s rather concentrated flow at 1 to 6 knots.
Characterized by warm temperature and high salinity, the North Atlantic Current is sometimes concealed at the surface by shallow and variable wind-drift movements. The current often mixes with northern cold polar water to produce excellent fishing grounds near islands and along the coast of northwestern Europe. The combination of the warm current and prevailing westerly winds helps maintain a mild climate in northwestern Europe. Major branches of the current include the Irminger, Norway, and Canary currents (qq.v.).
