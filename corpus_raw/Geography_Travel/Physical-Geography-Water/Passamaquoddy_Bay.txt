Passamaquoddy Bay,   inlet of the Bay of Fundy (Atlantic Ocean), between southwestern New Brunswick, Can., and southeastern Maine, U.S., at the mouth of the St. Croix River. Deer Island and Campobello Island are in its southern part. The bay has an immense tidal flow, with about 70,000,000,000 cu ft (2,000,000,000 cu m) entering and leaving twice daily on the turn of the tide. Passamaquoddy is derived from an Amerindian term meaning “place where pollock leap out of the water.”
