Buzzards Bay,  inlet of the Atlantic Ocean, indenting southeastern Massachusetts, U.S. The bay is 30 miles (48 km) long and 5–10 miles (8–16 km) wide. It extends to the base of the Cape Cod peninsula (northeast) and is bounded on the southeast by the Elizabeth Islands. It is connected to Cape Cod Bay by the Cape Cod Canal (northeast). The name Buzzards Bay may have originated from the misidentification of ospreys in the area as buzzards. The inlet’s jagged coastline is dotted with numerous fishing villages, summer resorts, and yacht clubs. The largest population centres are New Bedford and Fairhaven, which are located at the mouth of the Achushnet River. Woods Hole (in Falmouth town) is a centre for marine research. Among the lighthouses in the area are the 19th-century structures of Bird Island, Dumpling Rock, Ned Point, Wing Neck, and Cleveland. The Buzzards Bay Light Tower, rising 170 feet (52 metres) above mean low water, was the first lighthouse in the United States to be built (1951) over open water (i.e., lacking a foundation on dry land); the four-masted structure was scheduled for demolition in the mid-1990s. The name Buzzards Bay also corresponds to a village in the town (township) of Bourne, at the northeastern end of the bay.
