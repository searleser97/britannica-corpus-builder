Weeki Wachee Spring,  spring and tourist attraction in Hernando county, west-central Florida, U.S., 55 miles (90 km) north of St. Petersburg. The spring, with a measured depth of more than 250 feet (75 metres), produces a crystal clear water flow of more than 22,460,000 cubic feet (636,000 cubic metres) daily at a temperature of 72–74 °F (22–23 °C). With the development of underwater breathing techniques consisting of occasional trips by the underwater performers to free-floating air hoses, the spring (once a swimming and boating hole) was engineered and promoted as a showcase for an underwater ballet of “mermaids”—i.e., female underwater swimmers. A large auditorium was built 16 feet (5 metres) below the water’s surface with thick plate-glass windows for viewing, and the first underwater show was presented in 1947. Shows now include both male and female performers. Scuba diving, snorkeling, boat cruises, bird shows, and a petting zoo are also available. A water amusement park is adjacent to the spring. The spring, whose name derives from the Creek Indian words wekiwa (“spring”) and chee (“little”), forms a river which meanders through the Weeki Wachee Swamp to the Gulf of Mexico, about 5 miles (8 km) west.
