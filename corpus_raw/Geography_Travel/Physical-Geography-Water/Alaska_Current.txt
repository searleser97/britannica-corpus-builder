Alaska Current,   surface oceanic current, a branch of the West Wind Drift that forms a counterclockwise gyre in the Gulf of Alaska. In contrast to typical sub-Arctic Pacific water, Alaska Current water is characterized by temperatures above 39° F (4° C) and surface salinities below 32.6 parts per thousand.
Flow velocities at a depth of 16 feet (5 m) have been reported to be as high as 1.7 knots (1.9 miles per hour) for the southern portion of the current. Volume transport is estimated to be in the range of 350,000,000 to 700,000,000 cubic feet (10,000,000 to 20,000,000 cubic m) per second.
