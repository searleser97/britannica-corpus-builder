Jin dynasty, Wade-Giles romanization Chin, also called Juchen dynasty, Juchen also spelled Jurchen, Pinyin Nüzchen, or Ruzhen, Wade-Giles romanization Nü-chen, or Ju-chen, Mongolian Jürched, or Jürchid,  (1115–1234), dynasty that ruled an empire formed by the Tungus Juchen (or Jurchen) tribes of Manchuria. The empire covered much of Inner Asia and all of present-day North China.
Originally subjects of the Liao, an Inner Asian dynasty created in the 10th century by the Khitan tribes, the Juchen, with the aid of the Chinese Song dynasty, threw off the rule of their overlords and established their own dynasty between 1115 and 1122. They then turned to attack the Song and drove them south of the Huai River. Like the Liao they set up a dual-administration system: a Chinese-style bureaucracy to rule over the southern part of their conquests and a tribal state to control the nomadic tribes of Inner Asia. Their capital was at Huining (in present-day Heilongjiang province) until 1152, then at Yanjing (now Beijing), and finally at Bianjing (Kaifeng). The major part of their realm was in China proper, but the Juchen were very conscious of preserving their ethnic identity. To this end, they continued to use their own alphabet and speech and banned Chinese clothing and customs from their armies—although they had chosen the Chinese name of Jin for their dynasty. Their fierce warrior ways gradually disappeared, however, and the dynasty was finally destroyed in 1234, when it was caught in the middle of a newly concluded alliance between the Mongols on the north and the Song on the south.
