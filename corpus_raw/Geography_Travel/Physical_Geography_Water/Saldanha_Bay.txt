Saldanha Bay, Afrikaans Saldanhabaai,  deep, essentially landlocked harbour of the Atlantic Ocean, situated on the southwest coast of South Africa. Named after the early 16th-century Portuguese navigator António de Saldanha, the bay is both larger and safer than Table Bay, which is located 65 miles (105 km) farther south-southeast. Saldanha Bay’s former abundance of seals, fish, and guano deposits was long contested between French, English, and Dutch interests, with exploitation restricted only by a lack of fresh water in the area.
Important harbour works, exporting primarily high-grade iron ore, were opened at Saldanha Bay in 1976; air and naval bases, along with the nation’s professional military academy, are located nearby. Commercial fishing is significant in the adjacent Atlantic waters.
