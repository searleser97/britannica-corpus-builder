Prudhoe Bay,  small inlet of the Beaufort Sea and Arctic Ocean, indenting the northern coast of Alaska, U.S. It is situated about 200 miles (320 km) east-southeast of Point Barrow. The bay has been the centre of drilling activities since the discovery of vast petroleum deposits on Alaska’s North Slope in 1968. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline links the area to Valdez, an ice-free port on Prince William Sound (Pacific Ocean) 800 miles (1,300 km) to the south. Deadhorse, located near the bay, is the centre of much of the area’s oil production. Working conditions in the desolate Arctic Circle are severe, particularly in winter when crews face subzero temperatures.
