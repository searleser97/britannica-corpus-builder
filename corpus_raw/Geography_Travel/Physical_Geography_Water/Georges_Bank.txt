Georges Bank,  submerged sandbank in the Atlantic Ocean east of Massachusetts, U.S. It has long been an important fishing ground; scallops are harvested in its northeastern portion. Navigation is made dangerous by crosscurrents and fog. In 1994 large areas of Georges Bank were closed indefinitely to ground fishing in order to  protect depleted stocks of cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder.
