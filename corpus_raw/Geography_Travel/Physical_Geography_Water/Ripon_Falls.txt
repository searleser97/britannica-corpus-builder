Ripon Falls,  falls located on the Victoria Nile at Jinja, Ugan., just below the river’s outlet from Lake Victoria. About 16 feet (5 metres) high and 900 feet (275 metres) wide, they have been submerged by the Nalubaale (formerly Owen Falls) Dam, completed in 1954. The falls were visited by the British explorer John Hanning Speke in 1862 and were named after the then undersecretary of state for India, George Frederick Samuel Robinson, 1st marquess of Ripon (1827–1909).
