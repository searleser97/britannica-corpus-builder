Buckingham Canal, also called Kommamur Canal,  navigation canal in eastern Andhra Pradesh state and northeastern Tamil Nadu state, southeastern India. It was constructed section by section between 1806 and 1882 along the backwaters of the Coromandel Coast, which extends for a distance of 1,100 km (680 miles) from Cape Comorin northward to the Krishna and Godavari deltas. It was once the only main route by which bulky commodities, such as fuel, salt, and dried fish, could be profitably brought to the city of Madras (now Chennai) in Tamil Nadu state.
Although the canal was extensively rebuilt after 1880, its transportation importance was diminished by the construction of railroads and highways. In the 20th century, portions became unusable due to age, damage from tropical cyclones, and the expense of repairs, and some areas of the waterway were highly polluted from industry and sewage. It cannot be used by craft drawing more than 1 metre (3 feet) of water, and the canal has been substantially narrowed in some places due to construction, especially within the Chennai city limits. In the 21st century, interest in the canal increased as a means to mitigate seasonal flooding and to lessen the impacts of a potential tsunami, and the government has undertaken improvement projects.
