Narragansett Bay,  inlet of the North Atlantic Ocean extending northward from Rhode Island Sound for 28 miles (45 km) into Rhode Island, U.S., and almost dividing the state into two parts. The bay is 3 to 12 miles wide and receives the Taunton, Providence, and Sakonnet rivers. It includes Rhode, Prudence, and Conanicut islands and Mount Hope Bay (a northeastern arm), which is crossed by one of New England’s longest bridges. Since colonial times the bay has been an active shipping centre, the chief ports being Providence (capital of Rhode Island) and Newport. Much of the bay’s area is devoted to fishing and recreation.
