Gulf of Alaska,  broad inlet of the North Pacific on the south coast of Alaska, U.S. Bounded by the Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island (west) and Cape Spencer (east), it has a surface area of 592,000 square miles (1,533,000 square km). The coast is deeply indented by fjords and other inlets, including Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound (on either side of the Kenai Peninsula). The gulf receives the Susitna and Copper rivers. Large glaciers cast off huge icebergs, which are taken out to sea by the Alaska Current. Rising from the gulf’s shores in Alaska are the high Chugach, Kenai, Fairweather, and St. Elias mountains. Ports along the gulf include Anchorage, Seward, and North America’s northernmost ice-free harbour, Valdez, which is the trans-Alaskan pipeline terminal. Oil has been found along Cook Inlet and beneath Controller Bay. In 1741 the first Europeans to enter the gulf were a Russian expedition led by Danish mariner Vitus Bering.
