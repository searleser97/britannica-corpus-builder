Chambly Canal,  navigational waterway bypassing a series of rapids on the Richelieu River between the Chambly Basin and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, in Quebec province, Canada. Built between 1833 and 1843 and improved in 1850, it is nearly 20 km (12 miles) long and has nine hydraulic locks, a lift of 24 metres (80 feet), and a normal draught of 2 metres (6.5 feet). Vessels up to 34 metres (112 feet) long and 7 metres (22 feet) wide can be accommodated. With the smaller Saint-Ours Canal, south of Sorel, it permits uninterrupted water communication for about 145 km (90 miles) from the main body of Lake Champlain to the St. Lawrence River. It is a national historic site in Canada and is now largely used by recreational vessels.
