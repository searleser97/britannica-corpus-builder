Sunda Strait, Indonesian Selat Sunda,  channel, 16–70 miles (26–110 km) wide, between the islands of Java (east) and Sumatra, that links the Java Sea (Pacific Ocean) with the Indian Ocean (south). There are several volcanic islands within the strait, the most famous of which is Krakatoa, which erupted on August 27, 1883, causing a tsunami with waves as high as 125 feet (38 metres) that destroyed 300 towns and villages and killed about 36,000 people. The strait was the scene of an encounter between Allied and Japanese forces in March 1942. The Sunda Strait is an important passage connecting the Indian Ocean with eastern Asia.
