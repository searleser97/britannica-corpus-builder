Trondheims Fjord, Norwegian Trondheimsfjorden,  fjord, in the Norwegian Sea, indenting the coast of west central Norway. Extending some 80 miles (130 km) inland, it serves as a natural boundary between northern and southern Norway. Trondheims Fjord branches into many smaller fjords, the most important being Orkdalsfjorden in the southwest, Strindfjorden and Åsenfjorden in the east, and Beitstadfjorden in the northeast; it also has some islands, of which Ytterøya, near its head, is the largest. The fjord is bordered by a narrow strip of rich agricultural land that quickly gives way to steep mountains. Trondheim, the major export city for the area and the third largest city in Norway, lies along the southern shore of the fjord; the town of Verdalsøra is situated at its head.
