Yucat√°n Channel,   strait connecting the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, extending for 135 miles (217 km) between Cape Catoche, Mexico, and Cape San Antonio, Cuba. The north and south equatorial currents enter the channel from the southeast and form the beginnings of the Gulf Stream in the Gulf of Mexico.
