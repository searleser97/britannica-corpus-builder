Gulf of Darién, Spanish Golfo De Darién,  triangular southernmost extension of the Caribbean Sea, bounded by Panama on the southwest and by Colombia on the southeast and east. The inner section, which is called the Gulf of Urabá, is a shallow, mangrove-lined arm lying between Caribana Point and Cape Tiburón, Colombia. The delta of the Atrato River protrudes into the gulf. Farther northwest along the Panama coast of the gulf, Caledonia Bay is the site of remains of a 17th-century Scottish colony (New Caledonia), a shipwreck (the Olive Branch, sunk 1699), and a fortification (Fort St. Andrew, in use 1698–1700), all of which were discovered by archaeologists in 1979.
