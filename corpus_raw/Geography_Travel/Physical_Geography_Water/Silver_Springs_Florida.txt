Silver Springs,  series of artesian springs, in Marion county, north-central Florida, U.S., about 5 miles (8 km) east of Ocala. The springs, which discharge an average of more than 73,500,000 cubic feet (2,080,000 cubic metres) per day, have the world’s largest flow. The water maintains a constant temperature of 74 °F (23 °C). The source of the main spring is a cavern 65 feet (20 metres) long and 12 feet (3.6 metres) high. Most of the water discharged from the dozens of springs in the group is from the region’s abundant rainfall, which drains into the porous limestone subsurface and later gushes to the surface, filtered to unusual clarity. The springs sustain a large variety of aquatic life. Remains of mastodons, manatees, and extinct elephants have also been found, including some in the Silver River (formed by the springs).
The clear water is often exploited for filming underwater movie scenes. A 350-acre (142-hectare) nature theme park surrounds the springs, and glass-bottomed boats (invented there in 1878) take visitors on tours of the waters. Other boat tours allow visitors to view local wildlife and exotic animals. The park also has populations of bears, alligators, pumas, and crocodiles. Other park attractions include bird and reptile shows, a petting zoo, and botanical gardens, and a separate water park is adjacent to the springs. The Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto was probably the first European to see Silver Springs when he camped at Ocali, a Native American village nearby, in 1539. The springs were registered as a national landmark in 1925.
