Gulf of Thailand, formerly Gulf Of Siam,  inlet of the South China Sea bordering Thailand (southwest through north), Cambodia, and southern Vietnam (northeast). The Gulf of Thailand is 300 to 350 miles (500 to 560 km) wide and 450 miles (725 km) long. The Chao Phraya and Nakhon Chai Si rivers enter the gulf near its head. The main harbours in Thailand are located along the Gulf of Thailand at Bangkok, Pattani, Songkhla (Singgora), Pak Phanang (port for Nakhon Si Thammarat), and Chanthaburi; in Cambodia at Réam, Kâmpôt, and Kep; and in Vietnam at Rach Gia. The shallow waters along the gulf’s coast provide economically important fishing grounds.
