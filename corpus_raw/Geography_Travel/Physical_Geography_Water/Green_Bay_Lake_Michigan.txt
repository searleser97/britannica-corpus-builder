Green Bay,  inlet of northwestern Lake Michigan, U.S., along the states of Wisconsin and Michigan (Upper Peninsula). It extends southwestward for 118 miles (190 km) from the head of Big Bay de Noc (Michigan) to the mouth of the Fox River (Wisconsin) and is 23 miles (37 km) at its widest point, opposite Rock Island Passage (the main entrance to the bay), located between Rock and St. Martin islands. The bay is partially sheltered from Lake Michigan by the Garden Peninsula (northeast) and Door Peninsula (southeast). The Sturgeon Bay and Lake Michigan Ship Canal cuts across the Door Peninsula to provide a short route to the ports of Green Bay and Marinette, Wisconsin, and Menominee, Michigan. Another important port is Escanaba, Michigan, located on Little Bay de Noc. Entrance to the bay is difficult because of the prevalence of islands and submerged reefs and shoals. Hiawatha National Forest and Menominee State Forest (Michigan) lie along part of the northern shore. The first European to visit the bay was the French Canadian explorer Jean Nicolet, in 1634. The bay was the head of an important portage route for the fur trade between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River by way of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers. In 1968 a rich deposit of manganese was discovered on the floor of the bay. In 1973 the entrance channel to the port of Green Bay was deepened to 26 feet (8 metres).
