Jog Falls, also called Gersoppa Falls,  cataract of the Sharavati River, western Karnataka state, southwestern India. The Jog Falls are located 18 miles (29 km) upstream from Honavar at the river’s mouth on the Arabian Sea. As it plunges 830 feet (253 metres) into a chasm, the river splits into four cascades known as the Raja, or Horseshoe; Roarer; Rocket; and Ranee (“Queen”), or La Dame Blanche (“The White Lady”). A leading scenic attraction, the falls can be observed from bungalows on either bank of the river. A large hydropower project has been developed at Jog, downstream.
