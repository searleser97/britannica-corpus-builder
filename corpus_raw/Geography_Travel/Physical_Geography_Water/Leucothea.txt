Leucothea,   (Greek: White Goddess [of the Foam]), in Greek mythology, a sea goddess first mentioned in Homer’s Odyssey, in which she rescued the Greek hero Odysseus from drowning. She was customarily identified with Ino, daughter of the Phoenician Cadmus; because she cared for the infant god Dionysus, the goddess Hera drove Ino (or her husband, Athamas) mad so that she and her son, Melicertes, leaped terrified into the sea. Both were changed into marine deities—Ino as Leucothea, Melicertes as Palaemon. The body of Melicertes was carried by a dolphin to the Isthmus of Corinth and deposited under a pine tree. There Melicertes’ body was found by his uncle Sisyphus, who removed it to Corinth and instituted the Isthmian games and sacrifices in his honour. Leucothea’s link with Cadmus suggests possible Semitic connections; Melicertes may be identical with the Phoenician god Melqart.
