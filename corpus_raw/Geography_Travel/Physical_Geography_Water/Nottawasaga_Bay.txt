Nottawasaga Bay,   large inlet of Georgian Bay (and Lake Huron) indenting Grey and Simcoe counties in southeastern Ontario, Canada, and fed by the Nottawasaga, Bighead, Beaver, and Pretty rivers. The bay’s entrance lies between Cape Rich (west) and Christian Island (east). Many apple orchards are located near the bay’s shores, which form a popular summer-resort area, most notably near the town of Wasaga Beach. Important settlements around the bay include Meaford, Thornbury, and Collingwood. The name is from Huron Indian words meaning “outlet of the river of the Iroquois” (whose war parties used the Nottawasaga River to attack the Hurons).
