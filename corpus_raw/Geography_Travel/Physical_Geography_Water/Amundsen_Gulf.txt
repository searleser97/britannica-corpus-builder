Amundsen Gulf,   southeastern extension of the Beaufort Sea of the Arctic Ocean. Extending for 250 miles (400 km), it is bordered by Victoria Island on the east and separates Banks Island (north) from the Canadian mainland (south). In 1850 the gulf was entered from the west by the British explorer Robert McClure, whose expedition became the first—by ship and sledge—to cross the Northwest Passage.
The gulf is named for the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who was first to traverse the Northwest Passage by ship.
