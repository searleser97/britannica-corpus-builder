Gulf of Kotor, Italian Bocche di Cattaro, Serbo-Croatian Boka Kotorska,  winding, fjordlike inlet of the Adriatic coast, Montenegro. A fine natural harbour, it comprises four bays linked by narrow straits. The stark mountains around the bay slope steeply to a narrow shoreline on which citrus fruits and subtropical plants grow and tourist facilities have been developed.
A road follows the outline of the inlet, connecting several small settlements and resorts, the oldest of which is Risan, which existed as an Illyrian town in the 3rd century bc before being taken by the Romans. There are remains of many Roman villas and other buildings in the area of the gulf. At the strategic entrance to the gulf system is Hercegnovi, founded in 1382 and occupied at various times by Turks, Spaniards, Venetians, Russians, French, and Austrians. East of Hercegnovi is Savina Monastery, dating from 1030, which contains historic treasures. In the Middle Ages a “Boka Navy” was created with ships from the town of Kotor and other gulf ports; initially a trading guild, it became involved in naval battles and campaigns against pirates until the 19th century.
