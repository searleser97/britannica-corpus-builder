Jervis Bay,  inlet of the Tasman Sea, southeastern New South Wales, Australia. A broad bay, 10 miles (16 km) by 6 miles (10 km), it is partly enclosed by Point Perpendicular on Beecroft Head on the northeast and by Governor Head on the southwest. It was discovered in 1770 and named Long Nose by Captain James Cook but was renamed in 1791 for the naval hero Admiral John Jervis, Earl of St. Vincent. One of Australiaâ€™s finest natural harbours, the bay and some adjacent shoreland were ceded by New South Wales in 1915 to the Australian Commonwealth in accordance with the Seat of Government Act of 1908, which stipulated that the Australian Capital Territory (A.C.T.), 110 miles (177 km) west-southwest, should have access to the sea. The area is administered by the A.C.T. as the Jervis Bay Territory. The bay itself has become a resort area served by such towns as Jervis Bay, Huskisson, and Sussex Inlet. The Royal Australian Naval College was established there in 1915. Area of Jervis Bay Territory 28 square miles (73 square km). Population Jervis Bay Territory, statistical local area, (2016) 391.
