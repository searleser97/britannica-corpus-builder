Saint Abb’s Head,  promontory on the North Sea in the Scottish Borders council area, historic county of Berwickshire, southeastern Scotland. It is located about 12 miles (19 km) northwest of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland, England. St. Abb’s is a sheer headland with cliffs some 300 feet (90 metres) high. It is a national nature reserve administered by the National Trust for Scotland and the Scottish Wildlife Trust and serves as a reserve for nesting and migrating seabirds.
St. Abb’s Head was the site of a 7th-century convent founded by Ebba, a Northumbrian princess who escaped shipwreck there. The convent was burned by Norsemen in the 9th century. About 1098 King Edgar established a priory in the village of St. Abb’s; its remains still stand. With neighbouring Coldingham and West Loch, St. Abb’s, now a fishing village, forms part of a summer resort area.
