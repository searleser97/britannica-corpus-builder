Gulf of Euboea, Modern Greek Evvoïkós Kólpos,  arm of the Aegean Sea, between the island of Euboea (Modern Greek: Évvoia) to the northeast and the Greek mainland to the southwest. Trending northwest-southeast, the gulf is divided by the narrow Strait of Euripus, at the town of Chalkída. The northern part is about 50 miles (80 km) long and up to 15 miles (24 km) wide, and the southern part is about 30 miles (48 km) long, with a maximum width of 9 miles (14 km). The northern gulf’s western shore is very irregular; several large inlets indent the base of the Kallídhromon mountain range. The eastern shore is more regular although also highly indented, as is the southern gulf’s western margin.
Euboea was probably once connected to the geologically related mainland at its northern tip, and a land bridge certainly once existed across the Euripus, a submerged river valley the present water depth of which, at 20 to 27 feet (6 to 8 m), is navigable only by small vessels. The Euripus has been spanned since 411 bce, when the Chalcidians and Boeotians barred the channel with a dike and tower system. Chalcis has port facilities on both sides of the strait, as well as a shipyard on the mainland side at Avlis.
