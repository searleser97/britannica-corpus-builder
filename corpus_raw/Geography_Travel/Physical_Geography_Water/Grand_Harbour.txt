Grand Harbour,  picturesque small inlet on the east coast of Malta in the Mediterranean Sea. It is separated from Marsamxett harbour by Mount Sceberras, a rocky promontory on which Valletta, Maltaâ€™s capital, is built. The story of Malta is intimately linked with that of Grand Harbour. With the growth of the Dockyard Creek complex in the late 19th century, settlements around Grand Harbour increased. The harbour is a major port of entry for Malta and has customs facilities and several dry docks.
