Sargasso Sea,   area of the North Atlantic Ocean, elliptical in shape and relatively still, that is strewn with free-floating seaweed of the genus Sargassum. It lies between the parallels 20° N and 35° N and the meridians 30° W and 70° W inside a clockwise-setting ocean-current system, of which the Gulf Stream (issuing from the Gulf of Mexico) forms part of the western rim. The sea reaches depths of 5,000–23,000 feet (1,500–7,000 m) and is characterized by weak currents, low precipitation, high evaporation, light winds, and warm, saline waters, all combining with the lack of thermal mixing to create a biological desert largely devoid of plankton, a basic food supply for fish.
The brown seaweed (gulfweed) is kept at the surface by its small but prominent berrylike bladders. It then travels with the wind and current, apparently receiving minor replenishment from coastal plants drifting in from the southwest. The seaweed supports a specialized marine life, most of it characteristic of a coastal zone but some found only in this area.
The Sargasso Sea, which encompasses the Bermuda islands, was first mentioned by Christopher Columbus, who crossed it on his initial voyage in 1492. The presence of the seaweed suggested the proximity of land and encouraged Columbus to continue, but many early navigators had the fear (actually unfounded) of becoming entangled within the mass of floating vegetation.
