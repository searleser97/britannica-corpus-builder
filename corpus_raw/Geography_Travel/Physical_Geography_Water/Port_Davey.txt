Port Davey,   inlet of the Indian Ocean, indenting southwestern Tasmania, Australia. It is a glacial fjord, its entrance flanked by Point St. Vincent (north) and Hillyard Island. The inlet comprises two main arms, the shorter extending north to form Payne Bay and the other stretching 20 miles (32 km) east along Bathurst Channel to Bathurst Harbour. Passed in 1798 by the British explorer Matthew Flinders, it was entered in 1815 by James Kelly, who named it after the Tasmanian lieutenant governor Thomas Davey (1813â€“17). Port Davey receives the Davey, Spring, and North rivers and lies in an almost uninhabited region comprising mountain, forest, and moor. It is accessible only by sea and by a walking track.
