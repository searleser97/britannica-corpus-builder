Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument,  natural marine area lying off the island of St. John in the United States Virgin Islands, West Indies. The national monument was created in 2001 to further protect the resources of Virgin Islands National Park. It encompasses about 22 square miles (56 square km) of submerged reef and other marine environments adjacent to the northeastern and southern portions of the park. To allow recovery of depleted fish stocks and damaged reefs, the monument is designated a “no-take” zone for fishing. It also provides greater opportunities for tourism in the region by increasing the available recreation area. The monument is accessible by land at one location (Hurricane Hole) and via boat.
