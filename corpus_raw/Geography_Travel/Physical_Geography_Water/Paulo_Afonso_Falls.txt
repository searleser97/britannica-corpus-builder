Paulo Afonso Falls, Portuguese Cachoeira De Paulo Afonso,  series of rapids and three cataracts in northeastern Brazil on the São Francisco River along the Bahia-Alagoas estado (state) border. Lying 190 miles (305 km) from the river’s mouth, the falls have a total height of 275 feet (84 m) and a width of less than 60 feet (18 m). Water no longer freely flows over the falls, as a large hydroelectric station and dam intercept the river. Water does flow over the falls when the dam’s flood gates are opened. Prior to damming, the falls had an average water discharge of 100,000 cubic feet (3,000 cubic m) per second.
