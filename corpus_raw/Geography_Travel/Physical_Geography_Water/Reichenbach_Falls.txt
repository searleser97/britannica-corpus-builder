Reichenbach Falls, German Reichenbachfälle,  falls on the Reichenbach (creek) in Bern canton, central Switzerland, one of the highest falls in the Alps. There are five cascades with an overall height of 650 feet (200 m); best known are Upper and Lower Reichenbach Falls, with a drop of about 300 feet (90 m). Much of Reichenbach’s beauty has been marred by a hydroelectric development.
