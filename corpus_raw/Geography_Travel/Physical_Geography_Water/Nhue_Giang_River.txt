Nhue Giang River, Vietnamese Song Nhue Giang,  canal flowing north-south for about 70 miles (113 km) through the Ha Dong–Phu Ly region of northern Vietnam. It was built just before World War II by the French colonial government to regulate the flow of water in the wet-rice farming area south of Hanoi, which covers about 425 square miles (1,100 square km) between the Red River (Song Hong) and the Day River. The creation of the canal and of the large Day River barrage, 853 feet (260 metres) wide, ensured what is known to the Vietnamese as a “tenth-month” (i.e., autumn) harvest by draining the water. Irrigation water for “fifth-month” (spring) crops is supplied by a catch basin and distributed via the canal.
