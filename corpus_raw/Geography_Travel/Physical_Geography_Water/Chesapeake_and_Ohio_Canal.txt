Chesapeake and Ohio Canal,  former waterway, extending 297 km (184.5 miles) along the east bank of the Potomac River between Washington, D.C., and Cumberland in western Maryland. Begun in 1828, the canal was intended to provide cheap transportation between the Atlantic seaports and the Midwest via the Potomac River. It immediately faced competition from the Erie Canal, however, and further construction was abandoned in 1850 after the canal had reached Cumberland. From the 1840s the canal also faced stiff competition from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which was able to buy the waterway in 1894. The canal was purchased in 1938 by the U.S. government and was restored as a unit of the national parks system; it became a national historical park in 1971.
