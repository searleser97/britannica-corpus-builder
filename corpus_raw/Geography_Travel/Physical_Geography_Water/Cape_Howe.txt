Cape Howe,  southeastern point of mainland Australia, at the Victoriaâ€“New South Wales border, 300 miles (560 km) southwest of Sydney. It is the southern portal of Disaster Bay, an inlet of the Tasman Sea. The cape rises to the conspicuous landmark of Howe Hill (1,297 feet [395 m]). Sighted in 1770 by the British navigator Captain James Cook, the cape was named after Richard, Lord Howe, then treasurer of the Royal Navy.
