Scripps Canyon,   shallow submarine canyon in the Pacific off La Jolla, Calif.; it is the best studied of all submarine canyons by virtue of its proximity to Scripps Institution of Oceanography, for which it was named. The canyonâ€™s shallow tributary valleys head very close to shore in water only 40 feet (12 m) deep. The valley joins a larger canyon, La Jolla Canyon, at an axial depth of 980 feet, 1.3 miles from its head. There the walls of Scripps Canyon are V-shaped and have a height of approximately 360 feet.
