Bering Strait, Russian Proliv Beringa,  strait linking the Arctic Ocean with the Bering Sea and separating the continents of Asia and North America at their closest point. The strait averages 98 to 164 feet (30 to 50 metres) in depth and at its narrowest is about 53 miles (85 km) wide. There are numerous islands in the strait, including the two Diomede Islands (about 6 square miles [16 square km]), and to the south of the strait lies St. Lawrence Island (about 1,000 square miles [2,600 square km]). The U.S.â€“Russian boundary extends through the strait.
Some of the Bering Sea water passes through the strait into the Arctic Ocean, but most of it returns to the Pacific. In winter the region is subject to severe storms and the sea is covered by ice fields averaging 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 metres) thick. In midsummer drift ice remains in the Bering Strait. The strait is named after Vitus Bering, a Danish captain, who sailed into the strait in 1728. During the Ice Age the sea level fell by several hundred feet, making the strait into a land bridge between Asia and North America, over which a considerable migration of plants and animals, as well as humans (about 20,000 to 35,000 years ago), occurred.
