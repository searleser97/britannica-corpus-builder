Ekman spiral,  theoretical displacement of current direction by the Coriolis effect, given a steady wind blowing over an ocean of infinite depth, extent, and uniform eddy viscosity. According to the concept proposed by the 20th-century Swedish oceanographer V.W. Ekman, the surface layers are displaced 45° to the right in the Northern Hemisphere (45° to the left in the Southern Hemisphere), and successively deeper layers are further displaced so that at a given depth the water motion is opposite to wind direction. Current velocity decreases with depth because of the loss of momentum associated with the transference of motion from layer to layer.
