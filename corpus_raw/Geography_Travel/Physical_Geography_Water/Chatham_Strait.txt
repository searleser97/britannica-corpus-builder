Chatham Strait,   narrow passage of the eastern North Pacific through the northern Alexander Archipelago, southeastern Alaska, U.S. It extends for 150 miles (240 km) from the junction of Icy Strait and Lynn Canal, past Chichagof and Baranof islands (west) and Admiralty and Kuiu islands (east), to Coronation Island and the open sea. The deep, fault-formed strait, 3–10 miles (5–16 km) wide, is navigable and forms part of the Inside Passage between Alaska and Washington state. It was named in 1794 by the British navigator George Vancouver after Sir John Pitt, the 2nd Earl of Chatham.
