Gulf of Árta, Modern Greek Amvrakikós Kólpos,  deep inlet on the western coast of Greece. Almost landlocked by the peninsulas of Préveza on the north and Áktion on the south, it has access to the sea through the narrow Prévezis Strait. The northern shore of the gulf is formed by the combined deltas of the Loúros and Árachthos rivers, with marshes and lagoons; the southern shore has broad bays alternating with wooded, rocky headlands. The town of Amfilokhía lies at the southeast corner of the gulf.
