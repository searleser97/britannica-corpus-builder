Shoshone Falls,  cataract on the Snake River, southern Idaho, U.S., near the city of Twin Falls. The falls have a 212-foot (65-metre) drop, about the same as that of Niagara Falls, New York; early settlers aptly called the falls “the Niagara of the West.” Once spectacular, the cataract has lost much of its volume because water upstream has been diverted for irrigation.
