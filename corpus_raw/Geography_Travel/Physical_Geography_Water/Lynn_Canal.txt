Lynn Canal,  narrow scenic passage, 3 to 12 miles (5 to 19 km) wide, in the eastern North Pacific Ocean, southeastern Alaska, U.S. It lies within the Alexander Archipelago and extends north from Chatham Strait for 60 miles (100 km). It is the northernmost fjord to penetrate the Coast Mountains, which rise on its eastern side. The canal was named (1794) by Captain George Vancouver for his birthplace, Kingâ€™s Lynn, England. Just south of Haines, the navigable canal divides into two inlets, the westernmost to the mouth of the Chilkat River, the easternmost through Taiya Inlet to the port of Skagway, terminus of the Inside Passage (Alaska Marine Highway) from Washington state. The canal is home to many fish and mammals, including humpback whales and northern, or Steller, sea lions.
