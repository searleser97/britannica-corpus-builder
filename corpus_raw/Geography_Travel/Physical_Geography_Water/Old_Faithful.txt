Old Faithful,  geyser, northwestern Wyoming, U.S., located at the head of the Upper Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park. Old Faithful is the most famous, though not the highest, of all North American geysers. It was so named in 1870 by the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition because it seemed to spout “faithfully” every 63 to 70 minutes. Continuous observation revealed, however, that the eruptions occurred with some irregularity, the intervals varying from 33 to 120 minutes. After the 1983 Borah Peak (Idaho) earthquake, those intervals became increasingly less predictable, although detailed measurements made since 2000 revealed that most eruptions fell generally within a range of approximately 60 to 110 minutes, the average being roughly every 90 minutes. Ultimately, though, naturalists at Yellowstone have found that the geyser’s eruption can be predicted accurately only from one event to the next. Precisely when the next eruption will occur is determined by the duration of the preceding eruption: the longer an eruption, the longer the interval to the next eruption.
Old Faithful is an example of a cone geyser. Cone geysers are visible on Earth’s surface as mounds of porous deposits of siliceous sinter (geyserite). Cone geysers typically produce steady eruptions lasting several seconds or minutes. The duration of Old Faithful’s eruptions ranges from 1.5 to 5.5 minutes. Billowing steam and 3,700 to 8,400 gallons (14,000 to 32,000 litres) of hot water are ejected at each eruption. The geyser’s fountainlike columns reach heights averaging about 130–140 feet (40–43 metres), although eruption height can exceed 180 feet (55 metres). During an eruption, the water temperature at the geyser’s opening is about 203–204 °F (95–95.6 °C).
The Upper Geyser Basin has Yellowstone’s largest concentration of hydrothermal features and has long been the focal point for visitors to the park. The historic Old Faithful Inn (1903–04) is one of the country’s great national park lodges; Old Faithful Lodge (1918–28) and other vintage buildings are also in the vicinity. In 2010 Yellowstone park officials opened the Old Faithful Visitor Education Center. The facility provides park visitors with an opportunity to learn more about the geology, hydrothermal properties, and scientific study of Old Faithful and other hydrothermal features in the park.
