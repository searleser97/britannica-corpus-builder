Repulse Bay,  inlet of the Coral Sea, on the central Queensland coast, northeastern Australia. Oriented northwest-southeast, the bay is about 16 miles (26 km) wide and about 19 miles (31 km) long. The area was visited by the British explorer Capt. James Cook in June 1770. He had hoped to lay up his ship, HMS Endeavour, there for repairs, but the bay was insufficiently sheltered for that purpose. Cook therefore gave the name Repulse to the bay and the small group of islands at its entrance.
