Volga-Don Canal, Russian Volgo-Donskoy Sudokhodny Kanal,  canal linking the lower Volga River with the Don River at their closest point in southwestern Russia. The canal runs from Kalach-na-Donu, on the eastern shore of the Tsimlyansk Reservoir, for 101 km (63 miles) to Krasnoarmeysk on the Volga immediately south of Volgograd. There are 13 locks along its route, which drops 88 metres (289 feet) to the Volga and 44 metres (144 feet) to the Don. Three reservoirs—Karpovka, Bereslavka, and Varvarovka—occupy 45 km (28 miles) of its length.
Attempts to join the rivers date from 1697, when Peter the Great made an abortive effort, organized by the English engineer Captain Perry, to build a canal between two tributaries, the Kamyshin and Ilovlya, respectively, of the Volga and Don rivers. A second scheme was approved in 1887, but work did not begin until 1938 and was not completed until 1952.
The canal, which can take the largest rivercraft and smaller seagoing ships, opened up the upper Volga, Kama River, and Urals regions to oceanic commerce via the Don River (which also links the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea). Timber moving west and coal moving east are the principal cargoes on the canal.
