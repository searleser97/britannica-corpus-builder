Great Australian Bight,   wide embayment of the Indian Ocean, indenting Australia’s southern coast. By definition of the International Hydrographic Bureau it extends eastward from West Cape Howe, Western Australia, to South West Cape, Tasmania. The more generally accepted boundaries are from Cape Pasley, Western Australia, to Cape Carnot, South Australia—a distance of 720 miles (1,160 km).
The head of the bight abuts on the arid Nullarbor Plain and is bounded by a remarkably even and continuous line of cliffs, 200–400 feet (60–120 m) high. Between Eucla and Israelite Bay on the bight’s shores are the Nuytsland Reserve and the Cape Arid National Park. West of Eucla, near the Western Australia–South Australia boundary, the old cliff line is bordered by a sandy coastal plain. Lying full in the track of the winter westerly winds, the bight has a reputation for storms and rough seas. It includes the offshore Archipelago of the Recherche, Nuyts Archipelago, and the Investigator and Whidbey islands.
First visited in 1627 by the Dutch navigator Pieter Nuyts, the barren coast was surveyed by Matthew Flinders, an Englishman, in 1802.
