Peter the Great Bay, Russian Zaliv Petra Velikogo,  inlet, Sea of Japan, northwestern Pacific Ocean, in the Maritime (Primorye) region of far eastern Russia. The bay extends for 115 miles (185 km) from the mouth of the Tumen River (on the Russian-Chinese border) northeast across to Cape Povorotny. The bay reaches inland for 55 miles (88 km) and contains the port of Vladivostok, which is situated on the Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula between Amur and Ussuri bays. The town of Posyet is on Posyeta Bay (southwest). The functioning of these harbours is severely limited by the freezing of the bay from early December to mid-April. Formerly (from 1855) known as Victoria Bay, the inlet was renamed (1859) to honour Peter I the Great.
