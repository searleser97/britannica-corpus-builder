Inside Passage, also called Inland Passage, or Marine Highway,  natural sheltered sea route extending for more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from Seattle (Wash., U.S.) northwest to Skagway (Alaska, U.S.). It comprises channels and straits between the mainland and islands (including Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Can., and the Alexander Archipelago, Alaska) that protect it from Pacific storms. In most places there is ample depth for all vessels; anchorages are numerous, and extensive surveys have identified practically all hazards to navigation. It is the route generally used by coastal shipping to Alaska and is favoured for its scenic beauty and dependable smoothness. Towns along the passage include Victoria, Vancouver, and Prince Rupert (B.C.) and Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, and Juneau (Alaska).
