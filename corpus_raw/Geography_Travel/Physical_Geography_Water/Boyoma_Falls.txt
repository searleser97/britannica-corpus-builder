Boyoma Falls, formerly Stanley Falls,  seven cataracts in the Lualaba River, central Congo (Kinshasa). The falls extend for 60 miles (100 km) along a curve of the river between Ubundu and Kisangani. The total fall in the riverâ€™s elevation is about 200 feet (60 m), and the seventh and largest cataract is 800 yards (730 m) wide. Beyond the cataract the Lualaba becomes the Congo River. A rail line goes around the falls, connecting river ports at Kisangani and Ubundu.
