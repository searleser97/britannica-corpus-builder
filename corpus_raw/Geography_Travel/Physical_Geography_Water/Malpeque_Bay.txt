Malpeque Bay,  arm of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, indenting the northwestern coast of Prince Edward Island, Canada. The inlet, 12 miles (19 km) long and up to 10 miles (16 km) wide, is protected from the ocean by Hog Island. Its shallow inshore waters form an ideal habitat for oysters. Several oyster farms operate in the bay from headquarters in Summerside, a town 4 miles (6 km) south, producing high-quality mollusks that bear the inlet’s name, which is a French rendition of the Mi’kmaq (Micmac) Indian word makpaak, meaning “large bay.”
