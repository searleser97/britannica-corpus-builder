Charlotte Harbor,  shallow inlet of the Gulf of Mexico, indenting the southwest coast of Florida, U.S., between Sarasota and Fort Myers. It covers about 270 square miles (700 square km). The Peace and Myakka rivers enter the harbour’s north end, and a dredged channel serves the port of Punta Gorda. The harbour was originally named for the Calusa Indians; corruptions of the name Calusa led to the Spanish Carlos, which the British changed to Charlotte for the wife of King George III. In 1521 the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León tried to establish a colony in the area, but he was wounded and driven away by the Calusa and died later that year in Cuba. The harbour has mangroves and sea-grass beds and provides habitat for animals including manatees, sea turtles, wood storks, and dolphins. The harbour and much of the surrounding shoreline are included within state preserves.
