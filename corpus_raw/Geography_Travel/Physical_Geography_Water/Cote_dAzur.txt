Côte d’Azur,  (French: “Coast of Azure”), cultural region in southeastern France encompassing the French Riviera (see Riviera) between Menton and Cannes in Alpes-Maritimes département and extending into southern Var département. The population is predominantly urban. Traditional inland towns in Alpes-Maritimes include Gourdon, Èze, Utelle, and Peille; many such towns are perched on cliffs. Their streets are narrow and paved with flagstones or cobbles; houses are built of stone and roofed with rounded tiles. The doors of larger houses feature elaborate bronze knockers and hinges of wrought iron. The mas is the traditional farmstead of the plains and houses living quarters and sheds under one roof; windows are narrow to admit little summer heat. Farmsteads in the plains tend to be dispersed. Retirees have immigrated to the coast of Alpes-Maritimes, with the result that the population of the département is aging. Repatriates from former French colonies are concentrated around Nice. Tourism is the dominant activity, and the “sunbelt” image which it accords to this coastal belt has become a powerful factor in attracting big technology firms to the area.
Roman Catholicism predominates. Signes, in Var, commemorates Saint Eligius during the fourth week in June, and the sailors of Antibes honour Saint Peter late in June. Menton hosts a festival of lemons in February; floats are decked with lemons and oranges.
The region’s cuisine relies heavily on garlic and olive oil. Mayonnaise is made with olive oil and seasoned with garlic. Pissaladiera comes from Nice; this is an onion flan spiced with anchovies and black olives. Ratatouia (ratatouille), a vegetable stew of tomatoes, eggplant, and green peppers, also comes from Nice.
