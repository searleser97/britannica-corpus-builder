Keweenaw Bay,  inlet of southern Lake Superior, indenting for 22 miles (35 km) the coast of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, U.S. The bay narrows from a maximum width of 12 miles (19 km) at its mouth, and it is the eastern outlet for the Keweenaw Waterway, which cuts northward via Portage Lake through the Keweenaw Peninsula. The villages of Keweenaw Bay, Baraga, and L’Anse lie along the bay, which is popular as a summer resort area and is noted for its fishing. Early explorers, trappers, and missionaries used the site as a campground. L’Anse Reservation, which belongs to the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community (an Ojibwa, or Chippewa, group), lies along the bay’s southern shore.
