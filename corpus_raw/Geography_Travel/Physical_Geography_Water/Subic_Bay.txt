Subic Bay,  embayment of the South China Sea, southwestern Luzon, Philippines. The bay is located 35 miles (55 km) northwest of the mouth of Manila Bay and extends northward into the Luzon coastline. Rice, corn (maize), and bananas are grown in the area, and there are secondary forests around the bay. Olongapo, near the head of the bay, is the largest city in the region.
From 1901 to 1992 the United States operated a naval base, Subic Bay Naval Station, on the southeast coast of the bay, the largest naval installation in the Philippines. The area suffered heavy damage during World War II; it was taken by the Japanese in 1942 and retaken by Allied forces in 1944. Its proximity to Southeast Asia gave the U.S. naval base a prominent supply and maintenance role in the Vietnam War (1955â€“75) as well as the Cold War in the second half of the 20th century.
Following the U.S. turnover of the base to the Philippines in 1992, the area was redeveloped as a free-enterprise zone that included establishing a free port and manufacturing plants, building tourist facilities in the coastal areas, and converting the air base there to an international airport. Those activities provided a major boon to the regional economy. In 2012 the Philippine government agreed to begin allowing U.S. warships limited access to the Subic Bay port facilities.
