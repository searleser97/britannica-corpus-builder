Owen Falls,  waterfall on the Victoria Nile at Jinja, Ugan., below the river’s outlet from Lake Victoria. The falls are the site of the Nalubaale Dam (formerly the Owen Falls Dam), 2,726 feet (831 metres) long and 102 feet (31 metres) high, which was completed in 1954, using Lake Victoria as a reservoir. The fall from the lake is harnessed by a hydroelectric installation to provide power for Uganda’s industry and for western Kenya. A second dam, Kiira, was later constructed 0.6 mile (1 km) from Nalubaale. It was completed in 1999 and began producing hydroelectric power the next year.
