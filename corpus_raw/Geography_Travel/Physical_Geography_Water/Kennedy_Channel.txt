Kennedy Channel,   Arctic sea passage between Ellesmere Island, Canada (west), and northwestern Greenland (east). It is 16–24 mi (26–39 km) wide and extends northward for 110 mi from the Kane Basin to the Hall Basin, forming part of the waterway between Baffin Bay, an inlet of the North Atlantic Ocean, to the south and the Lincoln Sea, part of the Arctic Ocean, to the north. The channel is sometimes navigable in late summer and autumn. It was first explored in 1871 by Charles F. Hall of the United States.
