Barra Kunda Falls, Barra Kunda also spelled Barrakunda,  waterfalls located 300 miles (480 km) upstream from the mouth of the Gambia River, on the northeastern border of The Gambia and Senegal. They are formed by a ledge of rock stretching 200 feet (60 metres) across the river. The river is tidal up to the rapids, which are navigable by small boats during the flood season (November to June).
