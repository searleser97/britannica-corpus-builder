Bering Canyon,  submarine canyon in the Bering Sea that is about 250 miles (400 km) long—possibly the longest submarine canyon in the world. The canyon head is situated at the edge of the continental shelf north of Umnak Island in the Aleutians. Its upper half is fed by a number of tributary valleys and trends southwestward. With depth, the canyon turns gradually northwestward, then turns abruptly to trend north along its lower 45 miles (72 km) to its mouth on the continental rise at a depth of 10,500 feet (3,200 metres). The canyon is asymmetric in cross section; along its northerly trend its western wall is as steep as 13°, and its eastern wall has slopes of only 2° to 3°. Maximum relief is at least 2,600 feet (800 metres), and the canyon’s volume has been estimated at 1,030 cubic miles (4,300 cubic km), compared with volumes of less than 75 cubic miles for most other canyons. Bering Canyon is believed to have formed during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs (i.e., from about 5,300,000 to 11,700 years ago), when large masses of sediment supplied by Alaskan and Siberian rivers slumped down the continental slope.
