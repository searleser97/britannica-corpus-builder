Takakkaw Falls, also spelled Takkakaw Falls,  cataract on the Yoho River, and a major feature in the northern part of Yoho National Park in southeastern British Columbia, Canada. The Takakkaw (Cree Indian for “wonderful”) Falls is formed by meltwater from the Daly Glacier in the Waputik Mountains and consists of three distinct, nearly vertical drops. The Takakkaw was long thought to be the highest waterfall in Canada, but in 1985 a new survey showed its main drop to be 833 feet (254 m) in height rather than 1,260 feet (384 m) as was previously thought. The total height of the falls was thus accepted as 1,223 feet (373 m) rather than as 1,650 feet (503 m), making the Takakkaw considerably shorter than Della Falls, on Vancouver Island, B.C.
