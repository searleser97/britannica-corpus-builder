Pulicat Lake,  saltwater lagoon on the Coromandel Coast of Andhra Pradesh state, southern India. It extends from the extreme southeastern portion of Andhra Pradesh into the adjacent portion of Tamil Nadu state and has a length of about 30 miles (50 km) and a width of 3 to 10 miles (5 to 16 km). The lake is located on the swampy, sandy Andhra plains, and the surrounding area is sparsely settled. Towns along the lake include Dugarajupatnam and Pulicat. The lake yields salt and prawns. The long and narrow Sriharikota Island, which separates Pulicat Lake from the Bay of Bengal, is the site of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Indiaâ€™s satellite-launching facility. The only sea entrance into the lake is around the south end of the island, north of the town of Pulicat on the mainland.
