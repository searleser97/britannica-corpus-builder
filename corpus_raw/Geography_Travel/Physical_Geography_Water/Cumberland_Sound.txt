Cumberland Sound,  inlet (170 miles [270 km] long, 100 miles [160 km] wide) of Davis Strait and the Atlantic Ocean, indenting the southeast coast of Baffin Island, in southeastern Baffin region, Nunavut territory, Canada. John Davis, an English navigator, sailed into the sound in 1585 in search of the Northwest Passage. Blacklead Island, within the sound, was a noted whaling station by the late 19th century. The Anglican church established missions early in the 20th century at many settlements, including Pangnirtung (Panniqtuuq), on the northern shore of the sound. Now primarily a trading post and gateway to Auyuittuq National Park Reserve (8,394 square miles [21,470 square km]), Pangnirtung has a medical centre and hospital, a weather and radio station, and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police post. Economic activities include sealing, fishing, hunting, and the marketing of crafts through the local cooperative.
