Koro Sea,  submarine depression in the floor of the South Pacific Ocean. The sea reaches a depth of more than 9,600 feet (2,930 metres) and intrudes northward and westward onto the shallow submarine shelf upon which the two largest islands of Fiji (Viti Levu and Vanua Levu) are situated. To the east it encroaches upon a more narrow and elongated shelf that holds Fijiâ€™s Lau Group. Most of the sea-lanes linking the Koro Sea to the islands are densely lined with coral reefs, leaving only a few navigable approaches to the centre of the group of islands. The sea bottom is covered by the heavy basaltic rock common to oceanic basins.
