Oslo Fjord, Norwegian Oslofjorden,  fjord on the Skagerrak (strait) penetrating the southern coast of Norway for 60 miles (100 km) from about Fredrikstad to Oslo. With an area of 766 square miles (1,984 square km), the fjord occupies a glacier-formed depression, or graben, that has been partially filled and partially reexcavated. The fjordâ€™s forested shoreline is dotted with numerous towns and seaports and is one of the most densely populated areas of Norway. The fjord carries considerable shipping to and from Oslo. Its northern part splits into several smaller fjords, including Sande Bay, Drams Fjord, and Bunne Fjord. Oslo Fjord has many islands, the largest and most famous of which is Jel Island, near Moss. Most major rivers of southeastern Norway flow into Oslo Fjord.
