Gulf of Sidra, Arabic Khalīj Surt, Italian Golfo della Sirte, historically Syrtis Major,  arm of the Mediterranean Sea, indenting the Libyan coast of northern Africa. It extends eastward for 275 mi (443 km) from Miṣrātah to Banghāzī. A highway links scattered oases along its shore, which is chiefly desert, with salt marshes. In August the gulf’s water temperature reaches 88 °F (31 °C), the warmest in the Mediterranean. The gulf is important for tuna (tunny) fishing and sponges; and the main port is Surt—a starting point of many Saharan caravan routes. Salt flats are scattered along the coast.
During World War II the gulf was the scene of the Battle of Sirte (March 1942), in which a British naval convoy thwarted attacks from Italian warships and German bombers. In the 1980s Libya established across the gulf a national boundary and stated that no foreign vessels were allowed to pass; this precipitated several brief military conflicts with the United States. Libya’s maritime territorial extension was not sanctioned by international law.
