Caratasca Lagoon, Spanish Laguna de Caratasca,  lagoon in northeastern Honduras. The country’s largest lagoon, Caratasca extends inland from the Caribbean Sea for approximately 25 miles (40 km) and measures up to 55 miles (88 km) from northwest to southeast. It is linked to the Caribbean by a 3-mile (5-kilometre) channel, on the bank of which stands the village of Caratasca. Many islands, the largest of which is Tansín, dot its waters, and its low-lying shores are lined with dense tropical rainforests, which yield mahogany and cedar; shrimp are caught in the lagoon. The principal town is Puerto Lempira, on the southern shore.
