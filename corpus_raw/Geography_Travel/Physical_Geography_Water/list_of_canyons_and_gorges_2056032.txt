 A canyon is a deep steep-walled V-shaped valley cut by a river through resistant rock. Such valleys often occur in the upper courses of rivers, where the stream has a strong swift current that digs its valley relatively rapidly. Smaller valleys of similar appearance are called gorges. The term canyon is taken from the Spanish word cañón, meaning “tube.” This is a list of significant canyons and gorges, arranged by location and ordered alphabetically. (See also list of valleys.)
