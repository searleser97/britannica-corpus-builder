Limfjorden,  strait (110 miles [180 km] long) across northern Jutland, Denmark, connecting the North Sea and the Kattegat and separating the Vendsyssel and Thy regions from the mainland. Actually a series of fjords dotted with inlets and islands, it opens into a lagoon (15 miles [24 km] wide) in its middle course, then becomes narrow from Ålborg to the Kattegat. The strait is crossed by several bridges, and a road tunnel connects Ålborg and Nørresundby. Shallow in parts (maximum depth is about 82 feet [25 metres]), it has been deepened to aid shipping. Its western outlet at Thyborøn was open during the Viking period but silted up in the Middle Ages creating freshwater lakes, which drained into the Kattegat from the eastern end. In 1825 the tide of the North Sea broke through the western part, and the Thyborøn Kanal was cut in 1875 to keep the outlet open.
Limfjorden is noted for its oysters and mussels, and the ash and clay of the surrounding region supplies special lightweight building bricks (moler). The largest island is Mors, and the chief ports are Ålborg, Nørresundby, Løgstør, Nykøbing Mors, and Thisted.
