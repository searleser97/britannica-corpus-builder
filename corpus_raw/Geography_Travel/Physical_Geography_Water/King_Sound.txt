King Sound,   inlet of the Indian Ocean, northern Western Australia, measuring 90 miles by 35 miles (145 km by 56 km). Its entrance is flanked by Cape Leveque to the west and the four island clusters of the Buccaneer Archipelago in Yampi Sound to the east. The mouths of the Fitzroy, Meda, Lennard, May, and Robinson rivers are along its shores. A peninsula that divides the inner section of the inlet has the port of Derby on its western shore. A 35-foot (11-metre) tidal range poses a challenge to navigators, as does the presence of many shoals and reefs. The sound was explored in 1838 by John Stokes and John Wickham, captains of the ship HMS Beagle, who named it after the surveyor Phillip Parker King.
