Haro Strait,   passage of the eastern North Pacific, lying between Vancouver and Saturna islands of the province of British Columbia, Canada (west), and San Juan and Stuart islands of the state of Washington, U.S. (east). Part of the United States–Canadian border passes down the centre of the strait, which extends north to the Strait of Georgia and south to Juan de Fuca Strait. Mid-channel depths average 600–900 feet (180–275 m), but at its southern end submerged islands reduce the depth to 60–300 feet. Vessels approaching the city of Vancouver usually follow Haro Strait through the islands to the Strait of Georgia. The strait was named for Gonzalo López de Haro, a Spaniard who probably explored the waters in 1790.
