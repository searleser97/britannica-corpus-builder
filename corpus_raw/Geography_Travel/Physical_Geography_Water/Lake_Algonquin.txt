Lake Algonquin,  large glacial lake that once existed in North America and covered most of the area now occupied by three Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, and Huron). Lake Algonquin was present in the Pleistocene Epoch (approximately 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago), a geologic glacial period when the Laurentide Ice Sheet was retreating northward from the Great Lakes region. The body of water, perhaps 250,000 square km (100,000 square miles) in area and with depths of up to 460 metres (1,500 feet), at various stages drained through channels that included the Trent River valley and the Mattawa, Ottawa, St. Clair, and Mississippi rivers. Remnants of the lake include Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Nipigon, Simcoe, and Nipissing.
