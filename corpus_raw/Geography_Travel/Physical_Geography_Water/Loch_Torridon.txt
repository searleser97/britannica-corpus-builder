Loch Torridon,  Atlantic sea inlet, fed by the River Torridon, Highland region, Scotland, lying opposite the northeastern portion of the isle of Skye. The loch penetrates 13 miles (21 km) east-southeast inland and is divided into three separate reaches that are divided by narrow straits: Loch Torridon, Upper Loch Torridon, and Loch Shieldaig in the south. Much of the surrounding countryside is of outstanding beauty and forms part of the Torridon and Beinn Eighe nature reserves.
