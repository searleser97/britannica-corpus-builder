Mardals Falls, Norwegian Mardalsfossen,  waterfalls at the head of Eikesdalsvatnet (lake), east-southeast of Åndalsnes, Nor. The falls consisted of two cataracts in Mardøla district of Møre og Romsdal fylke (county), western Norway. The falls ranked among the highest in the world, with their total drop of 1,696 feet (517 metres) and individual descents of 974 and 722 feet. During the period of maximum snow melting in the spring, the waterfalls, descending from a hanging (tributary) valley, appeared from the main valley below to be one long cataract. Hydroelectric development dried out the waterfalls, though they are allowed to flow seasonally for tourism purposes.
