Chile Rise,   submarine ridge of the Pacific Ocean, trending southeast from Easter Island toward Chile after branching from the Albatross Cordillera (East Pacific Rise). Shallow earthquakes are common to this feature; using the epicentre locations of these earthquakes, the existence of the ridge in the vicinity was predicted before depth soundings confirmed it. Highly irregular relief, formed by troughs and asymmetrical ridges, characterizes this ridge. The Chile Basin lies between the Chile Rise and the mainland of South America.
