Georgian Bay,   bay, northeastern arm of Lake Huron, south-central Ontario, Canada. It is sheltered from the lake by Manitoulin Island and the Bruce (or Saugeen) Peninsula. The bay is 120 miles (190 km) long and 50 miles (80 km) wide, and the depth (generally 100–300 feet [30–90 m]) reaches a maximum of 540 feet (165 m) near the Main Channel, which leads to Lake Huron.
The principal rivers emptying into Georgian Bay are the French, draining Lake Nipissing; the Muskoka, draining the Muskoka chain of lakes; the Severn, draining Lake Simcoe; the Magnetawan; and the Nottawasaga. The Severn River is part of the Trent Canal, a series of navigable rivers and lakes joined by canals extending southeastward for 240 miles (390 km) to the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario. The coast of the bay is indented by Nottawasaga, Matchedash, and Colpoys bays and by Parry and Owen sounds.
The Georgian Bay Islands National Park, established in 1929, comprises some 40 islands in the southeastern and western parts of the bay. The largest is Beausoleil Island (4 square miles [10 square km]), once the home of Ojibwa (Chippewa) Indians. Another, Flowerpot Island, is named for two giant flowerpot-shaped pillars that were sculptured from limestone cliffs by the waves. The park’s landscape is varied and includes glacier-scraped rocks and some dense forests. The Thirty Thousand Islands that lie along the bay’s eastern shore constitute another popular summer resort area.
The surrounding region is well forested except for an apple-growing area along the southern shore. The bay’s important commercial shipping focuses on the ports of Parry Sound, Port McNicoll, Collingwood, Midland, and Owen Sound.
The French explorer Samuel de Champlain was the first European to record seeing part of the Great Lakes when he reached Georgian Bay from the north in 1615. The bay was named for Britain’s George IV by Captain Henry Bayfield of the Royal Navy.
