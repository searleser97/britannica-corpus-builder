Pamlico Sound,  shallow body of water along the eastern shore of North Carolina, U.S. The largest sound on the East Coast, it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by narrow barrier islands (the Outer Banks), of which Cape Hatteras is the southeasternmost point. Pamlico Sound extends south and then southwestward some 80 miles (130 km) from Roanoke Island to Cedar Island and is about 15–30 miles (25–50 km) wide; its greatest depths reach 26 feet (8 metres). It receives the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse-Trent rivers from the west, while the main inlets from the ocean are Ocracoke and Hatteras. It is connected at the north with Albemarle Sound through Roanoke and Croatan sounds. Numerous swans, geese, and ducks nest along the coastal waters, and there is some commercial and recreational fishing, notably for blue crabs and oysters. The name is derived from that of the Pamlico Indians.
