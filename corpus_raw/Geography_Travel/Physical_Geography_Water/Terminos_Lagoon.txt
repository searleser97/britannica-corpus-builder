Términos Lagoon, Spanish Laguna de Términos,  lagoon in southwestern Campeche state, at the base of the Yucatán Peninsula, eastern Mexico. An inlet of the Bay of Campeche on the Gulf of Mexico, it measures 45 miles (72 km) east-west and about 12 to 15 miles (19 to 24 km) north-south. Long, narrow Carmen Island stretches across its entrance enclosing it. The lagoon is fed by the Palizada and Candelaria rivers. Shrimp, fish, and turtles are taken from Términos, and crocodiles are hunted in the smaller adjacent lagoons.
