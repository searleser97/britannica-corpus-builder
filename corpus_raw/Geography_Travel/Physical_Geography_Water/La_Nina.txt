La Niña,  cyclic counterpart to El Niño, consisting of a cooling of surface waters of the Pacific Ocean along the western coast of South America. While its local effects on weather and climate are generally the opposite of those associated with El Niño, its global effects can be more complex. La Niña events often follow El Niño events, which occur at irregular intervals of about two to seven years.
The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), a measure of the departure from normal sea surface temperature in the east-central Pacific Ocean, is the standard means by which each La Niña episode is determined, gauged, and forecast. La Niña episodes are indicated by sea surface temperature decreases of more than 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) for at least five successive overlapping three-month seasons.
