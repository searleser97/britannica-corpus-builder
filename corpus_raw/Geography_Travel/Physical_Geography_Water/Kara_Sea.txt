Kara Sea, Russian Karskoye, Karskoe, or Karskoje More,  marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean, located off western Siberia (Russia), between the Novaya Zemlya islands (west), Franz Josef Land (northwest), and the Severnaya Zemlya islands (east). It is connected with the Arctic Basin (north), the Barents Sea (west), and the Laptev Sea (east). It has an area of 340,000 square miles (880,000 square km). Average depth is 417 feet (127 m), and maximum depth is 2,034 feet (620 m).
Several deep inlets of the Kara Sea cut into the mainland. The largest rivers flowing into the sea are the Yenisey, Ob, Pyasina, and Kara, from which the sea derives its name. Numerous islands, concentrated primarily in the north, are diverse in origin and landscape. Some are mountainous, others are completely covered by icy domes, and many are low-lying and sandy.
The Kara Sea lies on the Siberian Shelf; thus, about 40 percent of it is less than 160 feet (50 m) deep, and only 2 percent is over 1,600 feet (500 m) deep. The shelf is cut in the north by two wide, deep-sea troughs—the Svyatoy Anny east of Franz Josef Land, with a depth of 2,034 feet (620 m), and the parallel Voronin Trough, some 180 miles (290 km) east, with a depth of 1,475 feet (450 m). East of Novaya Zemlya stretches the Novaya Zemlya Trough, 650–1,300 feet (200–400 m) deep.
The Kara Sea formed as a result of deglaciation during the last Ice Age, traces of glacial ice being found under a thin layer of silty sediment. Rocky soils are found in the northeast part of the sea. There are also sandbars and sandy mainland shores.
Salinity varies greatly, from 10–12 parts per thousand near the mouths of the Ob and the Yenisey to 33 parts at Franz Josef Land.
Air temperatures below 32° F (0° C) prevail in the north 9 to 10 months a year and in the south 7 to 8 months. The average temperature in January is from -18° to -4° F (-28° to -20° C), and the minimum is -51° F (-46° C). In July, averages are from 30° to 43° F (-1° to 6° C), with a maximum of 61° F (16° C). Winter brings frequent gales and snowstorms, while summer brings snow, snow squalls, and fogs. For most of the year the sea is covered with ice.
The water masses of the Kara Sea are extremely cold and stratified. In the winter the water temperature averages 29.1° F (-1.6° C); in the summer it reaches 43° F (6° C) in the southwestern part of the sea and 36° F (2° C) in the north. Currents move in two slow, counterclockwise rotations in the southwestern and northeastern parts of the sea.
Fish found in the Kara Sea include cod, salmon, and sturgeon. The sea’s mammals include the seal, sea hare, white whale, walrus, and polar bear.
The Kara Sea is on the Russian Northern Sea route. The main port along it is Dikson. Timber, building materials, furs, and foodstuffs are the most important cargoes transported across it. The importance of the Kara Sea route has increased following the discovery in the Ob-Yenisey region of large deposits of oil and natural gas.
