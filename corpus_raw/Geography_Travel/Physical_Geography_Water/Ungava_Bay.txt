Ungava Bay, French Baie D’ungava,  inlet off the Hudson Strait, on the northeast coast of Nord-du-Québec region, northern Quebec province, Canada. The bay is approximately 200 miles (320 km) long, 160 miles (260 km) wide at the mouth, and has a maximum depth of 978 feet (298 m). It is fed by several large rivers, notably the Feuilles, Arnaud, Baleine, and George. Akpatok Island (area 551 square miles [1,427 square km]), at the bay’s mouth, rises to 930 feet (283 m). Its coastal region is rich in minerals, including iron-ore deposits to the west. Because the bay is ice-free only four months a year, much of the ore is stockpiled in Greenland and Newfoundland for shipment.
