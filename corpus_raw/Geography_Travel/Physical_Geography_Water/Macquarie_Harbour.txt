Macquarie Harbour,  inlet of the Indian Ocean indenting western Tasmania, Australia. A fault valley modified by glaciation, it extends 20 miles (32 km) northwest-southeast and is about 5 miles (8 km) wide. It receives the King River from the northeast and the Gordon from the southeast. A bar across the narrow mouth of the inlet (Hellâ€™s Gates) severely limits the use of port facilities at Strahan on Long Bay, a northern extension of the harbour. The inlet was probably visited in 1815 by an adventurer, Captain James Kelly, and was named after Lachlan Macquarie, then governor of New South Wales. In 1821 the coastal area was chosen for a penal colony to punish transported convicts who had further misbehaved. This settlement, centring on Sarah (Settlement) Island, lasted until 1833, when the difficulty of supply forced its abandonment. Deserted for more than 40 years, the harbour later saw activity with gold mining in the King valley and timber cutting in the Gordon. Sarah Island and the outlying Isle of the Condemned are now historical reserves.
