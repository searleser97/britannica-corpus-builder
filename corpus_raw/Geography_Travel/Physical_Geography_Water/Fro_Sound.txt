Fro Sound, Norwegian Frohavet,  sound in the Norwegian Sea, off the coast of west-central Norway. A busy commercial artery at the entrance to Trondheims Fjord, it extends for about 35 miles (55 km) between the Froan Islands to the west and the Fosna Peninsula on the mainland to the southeast in the Sør-Trøndelag region. Small fishing villages dot the shores of Fro Sound, both on the islands and the mainland.
