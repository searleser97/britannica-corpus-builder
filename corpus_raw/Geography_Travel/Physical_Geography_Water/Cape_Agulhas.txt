Cape Agulhas,  cape that is the southernmost point of the African continent, located 109 miles (176 km) southeast of Cape Town, S.Af. Its name, Portuguese for “needles,” may refer to the jagged rocks and reefs there that have wrecked many ships; another explanation attributes the name to observations by early Portuguese navigators that their compass needles showed no magnetic deviation there. A lighthouse was established there in 1849. The Agulhas Banks are excellent for trawling. The cape’s meridian (20° E) is the official boundary between the Indian and Atlantic oceans.
