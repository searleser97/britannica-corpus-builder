Cape Henry,  promontory at the southern entrance to Chesapeake Bay, on the Atlantic coast in the northeast corner of the city of Virginia Beach, southeastern Virginia, U.S. Cape Henry Memorial, a stone cross put up by the Daughters of the American Colonists in 1935, marks the site of the landing on April 26, 1607, of the first permanent English settlers in America, who named the cape for Henry, prince of Wales (son of King James I); they ascended the James River in their three small ships (Godspeed, Susan Constant, and Discovery) to settle Jamestown. Cape Henry also marks the site of the American Revolutionary Battle of the Capes (September 5, 1781). The memorial, part of Colonial National Historical Park, is surrounded by Fort Story Military Reservation and Seashore State Park.
The Cape Henry Lights are located at Fort Story. The Old Lighthouse was the first such structure in the United States (erected 1791–92). The nearby New Lighthouse (1879–81) is 157 feet (48 metres) high and has one of the world’s most powerful lights, visible offshore for 17 miles (27 km).
