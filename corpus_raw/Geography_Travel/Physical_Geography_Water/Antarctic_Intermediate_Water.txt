Antarctic Intermediate Water,  ocean water mass found in all the southern oceans at depths of about 1,650 to 4,000 ft (500 to 1,200 m), characterized by temperatures of 37° to 45° F (3° to 7° C) and salinities of 33.8 to about 34.5 parts per thousand. This water mass forms at the Antarctic Convergence in the latitudinal belt between 50° and 60° S, where water with the relatively low salinity of 33.8 parts per thousand is cooled to about 40.7° F. The resulting density, 1.02702, causes the water to sink beneath the surface before it slowly flows laterally northward. It becomes modified by mixing with other waters, but it is still discernible as minima in temperature and salinity profiles obtained at hydrographic stations as far north as latitude 35° N in the Atlantic Ocean and latitude 20° S in the Indian and Pacific oceans.
