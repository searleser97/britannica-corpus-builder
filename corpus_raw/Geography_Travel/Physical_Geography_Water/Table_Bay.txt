Table Bay,  bay of the Atlantic Ocean, located near the southern tip of Africa and forming the harbour of Cape Town. Extending north from Cape Town to Melkbosstrand, S.Af., the bay is 12 miles (19 km) long and 8 miles wide; it contains Robben Island and is overlooked by Table Mountain. Portuguese navigators were the first Europeans to see the bay (c. 1500). Although it was less well sheltered than other bays along the coast, it was favoured by the availability of fresh water and therefore became a place of call for ships voyaging to India and the East. The shore was permanently settled (1652) by the Dutch.
