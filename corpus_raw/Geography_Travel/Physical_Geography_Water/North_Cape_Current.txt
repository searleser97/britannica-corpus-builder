North Cape Current,   oceanic surface current, the northernmost extension of the Norway Current (a part of the North Atlantic Current), bathing the northern coasts of Norway, Finland, and Russia’s Kola Peninsula. Characterized by warm temperatures (39°–54° F [4°–12° C]) and average oceanic salinity (34–35 parts per 1,000), the current flows at speeds of about 0.5–0.8 knot, but it becomes colder and less saline as it enters the Barents Sea of the Arctic Ocean before separating into many branches. This combination produces a very unstable climate with many storms; at the same time, the higher temperatures of the current’s waters produce more temperate winters and well-above-average precipitation.
