Irminger Current,   branch of the warm North Atlantic Current, flowing generally westward along the south coast of Iceland. It divides into two currents west of Iceland. One proceeds northward and then eastward around Iceland, and the other flows westward and then southwestward, merging with the East Greenland and, eventually, the West Greenland currents. The Irminger Current is a rather saline flow that represents a combination of waters from the North Atlantic and the Arctic oceans. The thermal mixing forms important fishing grounds near the Icelandic coast. The current is named for Carl L. Irminger, a Danish admiral who conducted hydrographic studies in the area in 1854.
