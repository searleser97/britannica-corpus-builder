Brazil Current,   branch of the Atlantic South Equatorial Current, flowing southward in the South Atlantic Ocean along the eastern coast of South America from Cape St. Roque, Brazil, to about latitude 30°–40° S, where the northward-flowing Falkland Current deflects it to the east. The current is characterized by warm temperatures that vary from 66° to 81° F (19° to 27° C) and a high salinity that averages 35 to 37 parts per thousand. It is relatively weak and shallow, with a surface speed of one to two knots and a depth of 330–660 feet (100–200 m), and has a volume of approximately 353,000,000 cubic feet (10,000,000 cubic m) per second.
