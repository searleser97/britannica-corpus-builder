River Tamar,  tidal estuary in northern Tasmania, Australia, formed by the confluence of the North and South Esk rivers. It extends 40 miles (65 km) northwest to enter Bass Strait at Port Dalrymple, the mouth of the estuary. The latter was named in 1798 by the explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders and was the site in 1804 of York Town (or Yorktown), the first local settlement. About 2 miles (3 km) wide, the River Tamar is navigable over its entire length to the port of Launceston, but larger ships use wharves closer to the mouth at Bell Bay, Australiaâ€™s largest aluminum-production complex, and at Beauty Point and Inspection Head. Fertile terraces, which support orchards, vineyards, and sheep farms, line the river, which is paralleled by the East and West Tamar highways. The name Tamar was taken from a river flowing between Cornwall and Devon, Eng.
