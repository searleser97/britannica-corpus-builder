Wādī ash-Shāṭiʾ,  valley in south-central Libya. The valley extends between Wanzarīk town on the west and Umm al-ʿAbīd town on the east for a distance of about 87 miles (140 km). Wādī ash-Shāṭiʾ has one of the largest iron-ore deposits in the world; it was discovered in 1943, and, although it is suitable for strip mining, it is not high-grade ore. Manganese reserves also have been detected, and millet is grown in the valley.
