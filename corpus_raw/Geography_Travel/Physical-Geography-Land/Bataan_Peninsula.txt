Bataan Peninsula,  peninsula, western Luzon, Philippines, sheltering Manila Bay (to the east) from the South China Sea. It is about 30 miles (50 km) long and 15 miles (25 km) wide. Corregidor Island lies just off its southern tip at the entrance of the bay. Bataan is largely covered by jungle and is traversed north to south by steep mountains culminating in Mount Natib (4,224 feet [1,287 metres]) in the north and Mount Bataan (4,701 feet [1,433 metres]) in the south.
The peninsula was the scene of fierce fighting during the Pacific phase of World War II. After the Japanese invasion of the Philippines in December 1941 and the fall of Manila to them (January 2, 1942), the defending U.S. and Filipino troops withdrew to Bataan, defeating Japanese efforts to split the forces of U.S. General Douglas MacArthur. His troops fought a fierce delaying action until April 9, 1942, and remnants, led by Lieutenant General Jonathan M. Wainwright, escaped to Corregidor Island, where they surrendered about a month later. The surviving captured troops were then subjected to the infamous Bataan Death March, during which thousands of prisoners died. On January 9, 1945, U.S. forces under MacArthur sealed off the Bataan Peninsula. Landings were then made at Mariveles Harbor in the south and on Corregidor Island, thus securing Manila Bay for the U.S. Navy.
The major city on the peninsula is Balanga. Subic Bay in the north is the site of U.S. (1901–92) and Philippine naval bases. There are shipyards at Mariveles. Because of the proximity of Manila, none of Bataan’s five ports is open to overseas shipping. The towns of Orani, Samal, Abucay, Orion, and Limay are located along the eastern coastal plain, the principal agricultural (rice, corn [maize], sugarcane) district. Morong and Bagac are on the western coast. Hermosa in the north is the site of Roosevelt National Park (1933), a 3,296-acre (1,334-hectare) area with hot springs and a game refuge. Bataan National Park (1945), on Manila Bay, is largely a World War II commemorative area of 77,593 acres (31,402 hectares). Area 530 square miles (1,370 square km). Pop. (2000) 557,659; (2010) 687,482.
