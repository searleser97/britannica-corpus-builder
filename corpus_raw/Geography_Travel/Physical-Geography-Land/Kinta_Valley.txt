Kinta Valley,   West Malaysia (Malaya), one of the most productive and easily worked tin regions in the world. Formed by the Sungai (River) Kinta (a tributary of the Sungai Perak), the valley lies between the Keledang (formerly Kledang [west]) and Main (east) ranges. It forms the largest field along the western Malayan tin belt and has been mined since the 1880s. The river and its tributaries have laid down the cassiterite- (tin-ore-) rich alluvium. The ore is scattered as black, sandy grains through a surface now extensively mined. Older mines, largely Chinese operated and of the shallow, open-pit type, have given rise to the towns of Gopeng, Batu Gajah, Kampar, and Ipoh (q.v.; the state capital). South of Ipoh the ores lie deeper, down to 200 ft (60 m) in wetter ground, where dredges are used. Limestone occurs beneath the gravels and in the 2,000-ft hills to the east. The river’s course has been greatly modified by heavily loaded outwash from the mines, and large swamps occur in the south near the Kinta’s confluence with the Perak.
