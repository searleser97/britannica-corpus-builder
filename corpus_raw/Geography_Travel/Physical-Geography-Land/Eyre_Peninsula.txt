Eyre Peninsula,   large promontory of South Australia, projecting into the Indian Ocean. A broad-based triangular formation about 200 miles (320 km) on each side, it extends from a base along the Gawler Ranges and lies between the Great Australian Bight to the west and Spencer Gulf to the east. Generally sandy and rocky, it rises from an irregular coastline to a maximum elevation of 1,550 feet (472 m) at Nukey Bluff in the Gawler Ranges. Whereas the northern section has extremely hot summers, the south has a mild climate most of the year. Sighted in 1802 by the English explorer Matthew Flinders, it was named after Edward John Eyre, who explored the region (1838â€“41). The peninsula supports wheat, sheep, and barley; iron is extracted in the Middleback Ranges (northeast). There are numerous resort and fishing towns along the coasts.
