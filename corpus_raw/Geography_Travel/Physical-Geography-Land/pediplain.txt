Pediplain,  broad, relatively flat rock surface formed by the joining of several pediments. (See pediment.) Pediplains are usually formed in arid or semi-arid climates and may have a thin veneer of sediments. It is postulated that the pediplain may be the last stage of landform evolution, the final result of the processes of erosion.
