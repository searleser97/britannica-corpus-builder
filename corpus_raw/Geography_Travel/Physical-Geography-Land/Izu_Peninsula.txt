Izu Peninsula, Japanese Izu-hantō,  peninsula in Shizuoka ken (prefecture), Honshu, Japan. The peninsula extends 37 miles (60 km) into the Pacific Ocean between Suruga Bay on the west and Sagami Gulf on the east. The entire peninsula is included within the Fuji Volcanic Zone. Its southern part consists primarily of volcanic breccia, and its northern section is an assembly of numerous volcanoes, among which are Mount Amagi (4,613 feet [1,406 m]) and Mount Atami (2,539 feet [774 m]) in the east and Mount Daruma (3,222 feet [982 m]) in the west. The peninsula’s volcanoes are highly eroded and deformed by tectonic movements; the eastern half of Mount Atami and the northern and western portions of Mount Daruma have been downfaulted into the sea. The valley of the Kano River in the north is regarded as a graben (a depressed part of the Earth’s crust that is bounded by faults).
The Izu Peninsula abounds in hot springs of both volcanic and tectonic origin and is part of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. Combined with the warm winter climate, they attract numerous tourists. Chief among the peninsula’s spas are Atami, Itō, and Shuzenji. The port of Shimoda, northeast of Cape Irō, received the ships of Commodore Matthew C. Perry of the United States in 1854. It was subsequently the site of the first chancellery of the U.S. consulate general in Japan.
