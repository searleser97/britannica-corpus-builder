Kassándra,  promontory, westernmost of the three prongs of the Chalcidice (Modern Greek: Chalkidikí) Peninsula, Macedonia (Makedonía), Greece, projecting into the Aegean Sea. It is a part of the nomós (department) of Khalkidhikí. Upon the narrow isthmus that links Kassándra with Chalcidice stand the sparse ruins of the Corinthian colony of Potidaea, a port founded about 600 bce; its site is the village of Néa Potídhaia just south of the ship canal that was cut through the isthmus in 1937.
The Classical history of Kassándra revolves around the communities of Olynthus and Potidaea. Settled by non-Greek Bottiaians in the 7th century bce, Olynthus was subdued by Sparta (382–379), which dissolved the Chalcidian League that it had dominated for a decade. In 357/356 Potidaea was so completely obliterated by Philip of Macedon that the Athenian orator Demosthenes wrote that a visitor would not be able to identify the site. As a result of the Olynthian War (349–347) that destroyed Olynthus, Potidaea was revived as Kassandreia, which became very prosperous; in the Third Macedonian War (171–168) it repulsed a Roman fleet. In the early Middle Ages it was destroyed by the Huns. Kassándra was occupied largely by cattle and sheep ranchers before the War of Greek Independence (1821–29), during which its inhabitants were massacred by the Turks for joining the revolt.
The Kassándra peninsula has great natural beauty and fine beaches and has become the most important tourist centre of northern Greece.
