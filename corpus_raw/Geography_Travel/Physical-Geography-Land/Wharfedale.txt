Wharfedale,  upper valley of the River Wharfe within the Pennine uplands, in the historic county of Yorkshire, England, noted for its scenic attractions. The valley descends from the western part of the administrative county of North Yorkshire across the northern part of the metropolitan county of West Yorkshire. It widens below the point where Litton Dale joins the main dale from the west, and there agriculture, especially dairy farming, has more scope. The upper Wharfedale lies within Yorkshire Dales National Park. Grassington, formerly a market centre and now a tourist centre, is the chief village of the upper Wharfedale. Farther downstream is the Augustinian Bolton Priory (1155). The towns of Ilkley, Burley, and Otley lie in the lowest 8 miles (13 km) of the dale.
