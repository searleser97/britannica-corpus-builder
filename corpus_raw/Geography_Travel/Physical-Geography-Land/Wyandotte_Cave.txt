Wyandotte Cave,  cave in Crawford county, southern Indiana, U.S., near the village of Wyandotte, about 30 miles (48 km) west of New Albany. With 25 miles (40 km) of passages on five levels, it is the largest of the many such caves dissolved out in the horizontally bedded Mississippian limestones that extend southward into the cave-bearing regions of Kentucky and Tennessee. The entrance is about 200 feet (60 metres) above the Blue River. The cave was used by Native Americans and is believed to have been inhabited in prehistoric times. Outstanding features include Rothrock Cathedral—an enormous room almost 1,300 feet (400 metres) in circumference with a 175-foot- (53-metre-) tall rock pile at its centre called Monument Mountain—and the Senate Chamber, an elliptical amphitheatre 145 feet (44 metres) long and 56 feet (17 metres) wide. In the centre of the chamber, a mass of fallen rock supports one of the cave’s grandest spectacles, the Pillar of the Constitution—a great fluted column of white calcite that combines a stalactite and a stalagmite and is more than 70 feet (21 metres) in circumference. The cave also contains many fine examples of helictites (irregular stalactites). The temperature within averages 52 °F (about 11 °C). Little Wyandotte Cave is within the same state recreation area, and Marengo Cave is about 10 miles (16 km) north.
