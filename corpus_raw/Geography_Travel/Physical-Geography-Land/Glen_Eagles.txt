Glen Eagles,  narrow glen, Perth and Kinross council area, Scotland, running south through the Ochil Hills. Within the glen are the remains of Gleneagles Castle (14th century), which was superseded in 1624 by Gleneagles House as the home of the Haldane family. The track of a Roman road and an old drover road, linking the north with the Falkirk cattle fairs, also lie within the glen. About 2 miles (3 km) northwest of the glen, unconnected with the Gleneagles estate, stands Gleneagles Hotel (opened 1923), with three well-known golf courses.
