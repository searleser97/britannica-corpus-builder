Dingle Peninsula,  peninsula and bay in County Kerry, on the southwestern coast of Ireland. The peninsula begins south of Tralee as the Slieve Mish range, with elevations of more than 2,000 feet (600 metres), but in the west it becomes a mixture of hills and lowlands, with a north-trending line of hills near the town of Dingle. This ridge includes Brandon Mountain (3,127 feet [953 metres]) and ends in some spectacular cliffs. The mountains are penetrated by heavily glaciated valleys. The extreme west of the peninsula comprises mainly lowlands, particularly around the harbours at Dingle, Ventry, and Smerwick. The peninsula terminates in the Blasket Islands. Dingle Bay separates the Dingle Peninsula from the Iveragh Peninsula to the south.
