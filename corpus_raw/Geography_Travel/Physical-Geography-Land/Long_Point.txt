Long Point,   peninsula in Lake Erie, Norfolk county, southern Ontario, Canada. It lies about 45 miles (70 km) southwest of Port Colborne, which is the Lake Erie terminus of the Welland Canal. Formerly an island separated from the mainland by a small channel, it is now a narrow peninsula jutting nearly 20 miles (32 km) eastward into the lake. Long Point consists mainly of uninhabited sand dunes, but Long Point Provincial Park (356 acres [144 hectares]) is often frequented by hunters, campers, and fishermen attracted to the peninsula because of its wildlife. Despite the peninsulaâ€™s having been the site of a lighthouse since 1830, numerous shipwrecks have occurred along its shoals.
