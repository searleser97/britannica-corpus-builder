Pediment,   in geology, any relatively flat surface of bedrock (exposed or veneered with alluvial soil or gravel) that occurs at the base of a mountain or as a plain having no associated mountain. Pediments, sometimes mistaken for groups of merged alluvial fans, are most conspicuous in basin-and-range-type desert areas throughout the world.
The angle of a pediment’s slope is generally from 0.5° to 7°. Its form is slightly concave, and it is typically found at the base of hills in arid regions where rainfall is spasmodic and intense for brief periods of time. There is frequently a sharp break of slope between the pediment and the steeper hillside above it. Water passes across the pediment by laminar sheet flow, but if this is disturbed, the flow becomes turbulent and gullies develop.
Though features characteristic of pediments attain their fullest development in arid regions, beveled bedrock surfaces also occur in humid areas. In the tropics, for example, the surfaces tend to be mantled with soils and obscured by vegetation. Many tropical towns sited on pediments (which offer easier building sites than the steep hillsides above or the river marshes below) show severe gullying where the water flow has been concentrated between walls and buildings.
