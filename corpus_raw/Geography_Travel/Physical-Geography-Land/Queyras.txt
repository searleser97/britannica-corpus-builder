Queyras,  high Alpine valley of the Guil River in Hautes-Alpes département, Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur région, southwestern France. The Queyras extends from the confluence of the Guil and Durance rivers (near the village of Mont-Dauphin) northeastward to Abriès and then southeastward to the Italian border—a total distance of about 30 miles (50 km). The area is noted for its flora (about 2,000 species), ranging from Mediterranean to Alpine varieties. The Queyras is flanked by more than 100 peaks of the Cottian Alps; winter sports are popular there, and a number of villages with ski chalets line the valley. A slim canyon known as the Combe de Queyras is bounded by limestone precipices about 650 feet (200 metres) high and narrows occasionally to a mere fissure. The Queyras Regional Park, created in 1977, encompasses some 150,000 acres (60,000 hectares).
