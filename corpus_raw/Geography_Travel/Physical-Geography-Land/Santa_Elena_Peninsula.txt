Santa Elena Peninsula,   peninsula in western Ecuador that is the northernmost extension of the west-coast desert of South America. It is bounded by the Gulf of Guayaquil on the south and by Santa Elena Bay on the north. It is an arid region, but it has Ecuador’s important oil field at Ancón, as well as refineries, salt mines, and a fertilizer plant. The oil deposits, however, are not far from depletion. The peninsula offers fine seaside resort facilities at Salinas, and domestic tourism is of growing importance.
