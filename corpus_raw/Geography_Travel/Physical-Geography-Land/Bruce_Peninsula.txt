Bruce Peninsula, also called Saugeen Peninsula,  extension of the Niagara Escarpment, southeastern Ontario, Canada. The peninsula juts northwestward for 60 miles (100 km) into Lake Huron, separating that lake from Georgian Bay. After rising abruptly from its rugged east coast to heights of 200–500 feet (60–150 m) above the lake, the peninsula slopes gradually to its western coast. Although it is poor agriculturally, it is a popular vacation area. Much of the peninsula is part of the Bruce Peninsula National Park (1987), and the offshore waters (including Flowerpot Island) are part of Fathom Five National Marine Park. The town of Tobermory lies at the peninsula’s tip. Chief towns include Owen Sound and Wiarton.
