Lapi√©s, also spelled Lapiaz,   weathered limestone surface found in karst regions and consisting of etched, fluted, and pitted rock pinnacles separated by deep grooves. This rugged surface is formed by the solution of rock along joints and areas of greater solubility by water containing carbonic and humic acids. It is not clearly understood whether lapies forms on bare rock or forms under soil mantle and is exposed later. The grooves of the lapies may vary in depth from a few millimetres to several metres. Lapies commonly forms on tilted rocks, and the limestone base becomes extremely hard.
