Pine Mountain,   ridge on the Cumberland Plateau, a section of the Appalachian Mountains in the United States, extending for 125 miles (200 km) across southeastern Kentucky, along the Virginia border, and into northern Tennessee. With average heights of 2,100 to 2,800 feet (640 to 850 m), the ridge rises to Big Black Mountain (4,145 feet [1,263 m]), the highest point in Kentucky. A scenic highway crosses a section of the wooded ridge, which is partly within a division of the Jefferson National Forest.
