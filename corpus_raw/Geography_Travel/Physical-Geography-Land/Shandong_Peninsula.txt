Shandong Peninsula, Chinese (Pinyin) Shandong Bandao or (Wade-Giles romanization) Shan-tung Pan-tao,  peninsula in eastern China, forming the eastern section of Shandong province and jutting northeastward between the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli) and the Yellow Sea toward the Korean peninsula. The terrain, composed of ancient granites and metamorphic rocks and partly covered by thinner deposits of Holocene age (i.e., from about the past 11,700 years), is hilly, with elevations of about 600 feet (180 metres) but rising to 3,714 feet (1,132 metres) at Mount Lao. Fishing for croakers, hairtails, herring, and prawns is economically important along the coast, and tidal beaches serve as salt fields and breeding grounds for mollusks. Grain is grown on the narrow plains along the coast, and apples, grapes, pears, and tea (on the south side of the peninsula) are raised in the hills. Iron ore, magnesite, and gold are abundant.
Some of China’s best ports are located along the peninsula’s rocky, indented coast. Qingdao, a major port and manufacturing centre (electronics, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and machinery manufacturing), is on the southeast side of the peninsula. The port of Yantai, on the north, has a variety of industries, including textiles, food processing, machinery, construction equipment, and electronics.
