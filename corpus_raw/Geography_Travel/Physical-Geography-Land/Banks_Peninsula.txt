Banks Peninsula,   peninsula in eastern South Island, New Zealand, extending 30 miles (48 km) into the Pacific Ocean. It is bounded by Pegasus Bay (north) and Canterbury Bight (south) and has a total land area of about 500 square miles (1,300 square km). Generally hilly, it rises as high as 3,012 feet (918 m) at Herbert Peak. The peninsula was originally an island formed by two contiguous volcanic cones but was joined to the mainland by sediments of the Waimakariri River. It was visited (1770) by Captain James Cook, who named it after Sir Joseph Banks, and it was surveyed by John Stokes (1850). In the early 19th century, whalers and sealers made use of Lyttelton and Akaroa harbours, occupying the breached craters of the volcanoes. Later in the century, the peninsula was stripped of its forests. Agriculture (sheep, grass seed, and garden products) is now the most important economic activity. Christchurch, the largest city of South Island, lies just northwest of the peninsula.
