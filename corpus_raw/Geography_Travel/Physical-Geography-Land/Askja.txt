Askja, (Icelandic: Box)  largest caldera (volcanic crater) in the Dyngjufjöll volcanic massif, in east-central Iceland. It lies 20 miles (32 km) north of Vatnajökull (Vatna Glacier), the island’s largest ice field. Its rugged peaks, up to 4,973 feet (1,516 metres) above sea level, encircle a 4.25-square-mile (11-square-km) lake that occupies the caldera. Askja is the highest peak in the Dyngjufjöll; surrounding it is the Ódádhahraun, an extensive lava field covering 1,422 square miles (3,681 square km). The volcano erupted in 1875 and again in 1961.
