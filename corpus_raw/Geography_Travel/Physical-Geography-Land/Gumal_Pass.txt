Gumal Pass, also spelled Gomal Pass,  route along the Gumal River valley in the extreme southwestern portion of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. The most important pass between the Khyber and Bolān passes, it connects Ghaznī in eastern Afghanistan with Tank and Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan via Domandi and Kot Murtaza. The Gumal Pass is actually a 4-mile (6-km) defile (gorge), but the name is sometimes applied to the full course of the Gumal River. The oldest trade route in the area, the Gumal Pass has been traditionally used by nomadic Afghan traders called Powindahs, whose entry into Pakistan is now restricted. By treaty agreement with the Maḥsūd Wazīrī inhabitants, the British succeeded in opening the pass in 1889.
