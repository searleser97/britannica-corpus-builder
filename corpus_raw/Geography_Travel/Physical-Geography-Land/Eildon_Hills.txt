Eildon Hills,  three conical hills in the Scottish Borders council area, Scot., east of Melrose. Reaching heights of 1,385 feet (422 metres), 1,327 feet, and 1,216 feet, respectively, they present a striking appearance and have been the subject of much folklore. The Roman camp of Trimontium lay on the military road that passes nearby.
