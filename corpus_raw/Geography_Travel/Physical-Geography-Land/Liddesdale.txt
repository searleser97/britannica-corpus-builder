Liddesdale,  valley of the Liddel Water, southern Scotland, extending more than 20 miles (32 km) southwest from Peel Fell to the River Esk, which flows into the head of the Solway Firth. The upper Liddesdale lies within the Scottish Borders council area (historic county of Roxburghshire), but its lower portion lies partly within Dumfries and Galloway council area (historic county of Dumfriesshire). For 7 miles (11 km) the Liddel forms the Anglo-Scottish border, and its dale was long ravaged by border warfare and cattle raiders. The most important fortification is Hermitage Castle (1244), but the countryside is studded with minor fortified buildings (pele towers). It is still very rural in character, with the sheep farms of the enclosed valley land set between steep hills of rough summer grazing.
