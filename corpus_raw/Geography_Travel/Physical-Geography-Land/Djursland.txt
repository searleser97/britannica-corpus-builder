Djursland,  eastward projection of Jutland, Denmark, northeast of Århus. Water bounds it on three sides: Århus Bay to the south, the Kattegat (strait) to the east, and Ålborg Bay to the north. Ancient burial places, dolmens, and stone circles dot the low, forested landscape. Old churches, castles, and manor houses (Rosenholm, Gammel Estrup, Løvenholm, and Neilgård) draw tourists, and parts of the long coast have been developed as holiday resorts. At Grenå, an old textile town 2 miles (3 km) from the east coast, an 18th-century hall houses the Djursland Museum. Neighbouring Grenå Harbour is a fishing port with boat connections to Anholt (a Danish island in the Kattegat) and Sweden. A commercial airport at Tirstrup serves Århus and the region.
Inlets cut the southern coast of Djursland into several smaller peninsulas. On one are the sandstone Mols Hills covered with heather and spruce. On Helgenæs peninsula across the Ebeltoft Inlet, the winding cobbled streets and half-timbered houses of Ebeltoft preserve its flavour as a medieval market town.
