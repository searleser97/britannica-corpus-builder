Kowloon Peninsula, Kowloon also spelled Kaulun or Kaulung, Chinese (Pinyin) Jiulong or (Wade-Giles romanization) Chiu-lung,  part of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, southeastern China. It constitutes the Chinese mainland portion of the Hong Kong region and is located north of Hong Kong Island and east of the mouth of the Pearl (Zhu) River Delta. Geographically, it consists of two portions: the hillier, more rural, and farmed New Territories to the north and west and the more residential and industrial Kowloon area to the south and east. In some instances, the use of the name Kowloon Peninsula is restricted to only the southern section of the peninsula that directly faces Hong Kong Island and is surrounded on three sides by Victoria Harbour.
The chief sectors of the densely populated Kowloon area of the peninsula and the contiguous urban sprawl farther east are Tsim Sha Tsui (a popular business, shopping, and entertainment district at the tip of the peninsula), Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok (one of the most densely populated areas on Earth), New Kowloon, San Po Kong, Kowloon City, the industrialized Kwun Tong, and the Kowloon Walled City (a somewhat shady district of crime and squalor). Since the 1950s, Kowloon has become an industrial centre (particularly of textile manufacturing) and rivals Victoria as a tourist destination. The harbour accommodates oceangoing vessels. Area Kowloon area, 18 square miles (47 square km). Pop. (2001) Kowloon area, 2,023,979; (2005 est.) 2,070,000.
