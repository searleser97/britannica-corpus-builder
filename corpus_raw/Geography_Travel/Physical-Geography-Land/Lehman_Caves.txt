Lehman Caves,  large, spectacular cavern at Great Basin National Park in eastern Nevada, U.S. The cave lies 5 miles (8 km) west of Baker at the base of the eastern slope of Wheeler Peak (13,063 feet [3,982 metres]) in the Snake Range. It is made of light gray and white limestone that is honeycombed by tunnels and galleries containing a spectacular array of stalactites, stalagmites, and other cave deposits.
The cavern was discovered in the mid 1880s by Absalom Lehman, a local prospector and rancher. Lehman Caves (as the cavern came to be known) was established in 1922 as a national monument and was incorporated into Great Basin National Park when the park was established in 1986. There is evidence that the cave was used as a burial place by prehistoric Native Americans.
