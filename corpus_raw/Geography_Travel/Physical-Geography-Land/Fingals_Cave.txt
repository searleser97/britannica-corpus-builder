Fingal’s Cave,  most famous of the sea caves in the basalt southwest coast of Staffa, an island of the Inner Hebrides, western Scotland. Estimates of its length vary between 227 feet (69 metres) and 270 feet (82 metres), and its arched roof is said to reach between 66 feet (20 metres) and 72 feet (22 metres) above sea level. It is about 40 feet (12 metres) wide. Its floor is covered by about 25 feet (7.6metres) of water. The cave is embedded in symmetrical, hexagonally jointed basalt columns that were formed from lava flows by cooling and pressure.
The cave’s arched roof lends it remarkable natural acoustics that harmoniously echo the sound of the swelling ocean waves within it. Fingal’s Cave shares its geological origins with the Giant’s Causeway of Northern Ireland, to which it may have once been connected by the same massive lava flow. Like the Causeway, its Celtic legendary origins are found by many in the exploits of Finn MacCumhaill (MacCool) of the Fenian cycle of Gaelic literature.
After being “rediscovered” in 1772 by naturalist Sir Joseph Banks, the cave became a tourist magnet. Its famous visitors included Queen Victoria as well as the poets William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and John Keats, along with novelists Jules Verne and Sir Walter Scott. Painter J.M.W. Turner rendered it on canvas, and German composer Felix Mendelssohn found in it the inspiration for his overture The Hebrides, Op. 26.
