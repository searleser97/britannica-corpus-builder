Waipio Valley, Hawaiian Waipi‘o, also called Valley of the Kings,  valley in the Kohala Mountains, northern Hawaii island, Hawaii, U.S. Enveloped on three sides by 2,500-foot- (750-metre-) high cliffs ribboned with spectacular waterfalls (including Hiilawe Falls, which drops more than 1,000 feet [300 metres]), the picturesque valley faces a heavy Pacific surf along the Hamakua coast, where it is fringed by an impassable reef. The valley, whose name means “Curving Water,” was once the home of a large native community and is the birthplace of many island legends. King Kamehameha I was raised in the area, but it has been virtually uninhabited since 1946, when a tsunami devastated the valley. Its flat alluvial floor is covered with lush vegetation and drained by Waipio Stream, which enters the ocean at a black-sand beach. Swift headwaters and landslides have caused Kawainui Stream to be diverted westward into the valley. The fertile floor is now used for taro farming, and the sheer cliffs are a popular challenge for island rock climbers.
