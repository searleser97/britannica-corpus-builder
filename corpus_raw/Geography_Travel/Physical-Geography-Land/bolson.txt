Bolson,   (from Spanish bolsón, “large purse”), a semiarid, flat-floored desert valley or depression, usually centred on a playa or salt pan and entirely surrounded by hills or mountains. It is a type of basin characteristic of basin-and-range terrain. The term is usually applied only to certain basins of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.
