Somali Basin,   submarine basin on the floor of the southwestern Arabian Sea, an arm of the Indian Ocean, east of Somalia. The Carlsberg Ridge separates it from the shallower Arabian Basin to the northeast. The Somali Basin also connects with the Mascarene and Madagascar basins to the south, with sill depths greater than 11,800 feet (3,600 m). Sill depths between the Somali and Arabian basins have been deduced from the minimum temperatures observed in the two areas.
