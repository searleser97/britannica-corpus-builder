Rybachy Peninsula, Rybachy also spelled Rybaƒçij, Russian Poluostrov Rybachy,  peninsula in the northwestern part of the Murmansk oblast (province), northwestern Russia, jutting into the Barents Sea. Its most northerly point is Cape Nemetsky. Geologically, the peninsula is strikingly different from the rest of the Kola Peninsula, from which it is separated by the Gulf of Motovsky. It consists of sedimentary strata from the early Silurian Period (about 438 to 421 million years ago), considerably more recent than those of Kola. The Rybachy Peninsula reaches an elevation of 981 feet (299 metres) and is covered with tundra vegetation.
