Cape Verde Peninsula, French Presqu’île du Cap Vert,  peninsula in west-central Senegal that is the westernmost point of the African continent. Formed by a combination of volcanic offshore islands and a land bridge produced by coastal currents, it projects into the Atlantic Ocean, bending back to the southeast at its tip. Exposure to southwesterly winds contributes to Cape Verde’s seasonal verdant appearance, in contrast to the undulating yellow dunes to the north. The cape is the site of modern day Dakar, the capital of Senegal, and its immediate suburbs.
The peninsula is shaped like a triangle (about 9 miles [15 km] per side), with the base of the triangle roughly along the north and its apex on the south, the site of the seaport of Dakar. Near Pointe des Almadies, the northwestern tip of the cape, lies Dakar’s international airport, famous as a transatlantic ferrying point during World War II. Twin volcanic cones, the Deux Mamelles ("Two Teats"), dominate the landscape along the coast northwest of Dakar. The peninsula embraces a bay and an excellent natural harbour in the southwest.
The indigenous inhabitants of the peninsula, the Lebu, lived as fishermen and farmers. Since about 1444, when the Portuguese first sighted the cape, it has been an entrepôt for African-European trade. The French later established the city of Dakar on the cape in 1857.
