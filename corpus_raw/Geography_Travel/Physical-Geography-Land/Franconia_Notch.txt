Franconia Notch,  scenic pass between the towering peaks of the Franconia (east) and Kinsman (west) ranges in the White Mountains, northwestern New Hampshire, U.S. The pass is located in Grafton county just north of North Woodstock and is about 8 miles (13 km) long. An impressive example of glacial action, the pass includes at its southern end the Flume, a narrow gorge 70 feet (21 metres) deep that extends along the flank of Mount Liberty (4,460 feet [1,359 metres]). Cannon Mountain (4,186 feet [1,276 metres]) itself, which is 5 miles (8 km) south of Franconia village, has skiing facilities and an aerial tramway to its summit. One of the stateâ€™s most famous landmarks, the Old Man of the Mountain (also called the Great Stone Face or the Profile), was located on Cannon Mountain. Comprising ledges of granite (48 feet [15 metres] high) shaped like a face on the mountainside 1,200 feet (366 metres) above Profile Lake, it collapsed in 2003 despite numerous efforts to protect it. Echo Lake, at the head of the Notch and surrounded on three sides by mountains, is noted for boating, fishing, and swimming. The Pemigewasset River rises in the Notch and follows the pass, from which it flows southward for about 70 miles (113 km) to join the Winnipesaukee River and form the Merrimack. The area, made a state park in 1928, is traversed by the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.
