Plynlimon, Welsh Pumlumon,  ridge on the gritstone plateau of central Wales, reaching an elevation of 2,468 feet (752 metres) at Plynlimon Fawr. The ridge marks the watershed between drainage westward to Cardigan Bay and eastward to the Rivers Severn and Wye, flowing toward England and ultimately the Bristol Channel. It forms part of the administrative boundary between the counties of Ceredigion and Powys. Plynlimon is known for its mists and general wetness. Much of the surface is boggy and of little agricultural value except for sheep grazing. Extensive planting of conifers has been carried out by the British Forestry Commission. The heavy rainfall sustains reservoirs supplying water to the industrial cities of England. Mining for lead was active in the 19th century and led to an extension of settlement; abandoned lead mines dot the slopes of the ridge. The area now suffers from severe rural depopulation.
