Sand mountain,  isolated mountain of sand formed in an open desert area by the action of strong winds blowing from various directions. These huge accumulations of sand may reach up to 300 metres (1,000 feet) in height in Saudi Arabia and in the Namib Desert. They generally remain stable for centuries and are used as desert landmarks. They resemble a several-pointed star in plan view, and sharp-crested ridges rise from the basal points to a central peak. In their smaller versions they are called pyramidal or star dunes.
