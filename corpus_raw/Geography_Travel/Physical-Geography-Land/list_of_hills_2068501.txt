 Hills are landforms that rise above the surrounding terrain and have relatively confined summits but are generally understood to be smaller than mountains. There is no formal distinction between the two. This is a list of hills, ordered alphabetically by country. Also included are landforms such as tors, which are elevated rock formations that may occur at the summits of hills or in isolation, as well as notable regions of hilly terrain.
