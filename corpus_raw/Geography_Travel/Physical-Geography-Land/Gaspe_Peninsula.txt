Gaspé Peninsula, French Péninsule de la Gaspésie, English Gaspesia,  peninsula in eastern Quebec province, Canada. The peninsula extends east-northeastward for 150 miles (240 km) from the Matapédia River into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is situated between the St. Lawrence River (north) and Chaleur Bay and New Brunswick (south). The well-forested Monts Chic-Choc (Shickshock Mountains), which are an extension of the Appalachians, parallel the St. Lawrence in the north-central portion and rise to Mount Jacques Cartier (4,160 feet [1,268 m]). A number of rivers drain the peninsula, including the Cascapédia, Saint-Jean, York, Grande, and du Grand Pabos. The chief settlements are along the coast: Matane, Gaspé, Percé, Chandler, and New-Carlisle.
Much of the region is within conservation areas, including Gaspesian Provincial Park. A highway encircling the peninsula affords views of the rugged and picturesque coastal and mountain scenery. Forillon, a national park occupying 93 square miles (240 square km), is at the northeastern tip of the peninsula. Both sporting and local interests benefit from the excellent hunting and fishing; the peninsula is drained by several outstanding salmon rivers. Lumbering is also a main economic activity; and there is some mining of copper, lead, and zinc and the production of pulp for papermaking.
