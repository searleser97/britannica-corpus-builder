Sandomierz Basin, Polish Kotlina Sandomierska,  lowland region, southeastern Poland, located south of the Lublin Uplands and north of the Western Carpathian foothills. It is drained by the Vistula River and its tributary the San River.
The Sandomierz Basin is a structural depression with natural transportation routes connecting the basin in an easterly direction with the upper Dniester River valley (in Ukraine) and in a westerly direction with the Oświęcim Basin on the upper Vistula River near Kraków. Sandy tracts are widespread in the northern part of the depression, while marshy conditions exist in the area of the Vistula-San confluence. The region contains deposits of sulfur, natural gas, and petroleum. Rzeszów and Tarnów are principal industrial and commercial centres in the basin.
