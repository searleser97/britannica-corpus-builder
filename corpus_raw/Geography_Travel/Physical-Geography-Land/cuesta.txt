Cuesta, (Spanish: “slope”, ) also called Homoclinal Ridge,  physical feature that has a steep cliff or escarpment on one side and a gentle dip or back slope on the other. This landform occurs in areas of tilted strata and is caused by the differential weathering and erosion of the hard capping layer and the soft underlying cliff maker, which erodes more rapidly. Cuestas with dip slopes of 40°–45° are usually called hogback ridges.
Cuesta escarpments tend to be cut into rough, hilly country with numerous ravines and steep valleys, because the short streams flowing down the steep scarp face erode rapidly. The back slopes commonly are smooth. Cuestas are common in the United States, notably in Arizona and New Mexico and along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.
