Land’s End, Cornish Pedn-an-Laaz,  westernmost peninsula of the county of Cornwall, England. Composed of a granite mass, its tip is the southwesternmost point of England and lies about 870 miles (1,400 km) by road from John o’ Groats, traditionally considered the northernmost point of Great Britain. The popular expression “from Land’s End to John o’ Groats” means “from end to end of Britain.” Land’s End is a major British tourist attraction. Off its rocky but scenic coast lie dangerous reefs, one group of which, a mile from the mainland, is marked by the Longships lighthouse.
