Arthur Pass, also spelled Arthur’s Pass,  road through the Southern Alps, west-central South Island, New Zealand. At an elevation of 3,018 feet (920 metres), it is the lowest pass and the only crossing for motor traffic between the Haast and Lewis passes. It crosses a mountain ridge between peaks 6,000 feet (1,800 metres) high. The pass was the site of a temporary settlement (Camping Flat) for Maori, explorers, and miners successively since the 1850s, but it did not become a major route until gold was discovered in Westland in 1864. A road was put through two years later. The Otira Viaduct, completed in 1999, replaced a dangerous 1,450-foot (440-metre) stretch of the road through the pass. The Otira Railway Tunnel, more than 5 miles (8 km) long, lies beneath the pass and is the only rail link across South Island. Arthur’s Pass National Park (383 square miles [993 square km]) was created in 1929. The pass was named for the explorer Sir Arthur Dudley Dobson.
