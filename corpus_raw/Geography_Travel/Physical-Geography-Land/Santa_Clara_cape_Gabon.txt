Santa-Clara,  cape situated on the Atlantic coast of northwestern Gabon, Africa. Extending south from the larger peninsula that separates the Gabon estuary from Corisco Bay, the cape juts into the mouth of the estuary. Santa-Clara is located 12 miles (20 km) north of Libreville and just north of Owendo, one of Gabon’s major ports. Like Cape Esterias, still farther north, Santa-Clara has fine sand beaches that attract some tourism. Okoumé trees have been planted on the cape as part of a forestry development scheme. Since the late 20th century Santa-Clara has been the site of a mineral-exporting port (for iron, manganese, and uranium), part of the Owendo port complex at the western terminus of the Trans-Gabon Railway.
