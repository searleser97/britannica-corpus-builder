River terrace,   bench or step that extends along the side of a valley and represents a former level of the valley floor. A terrace results from any hydrological or climatic shift that causes renewed downcutting. It generally has a flat top made up of sedimentary deposits and a steep fore edge, and it may be the remains of an old floodplain, cut through by the river and left standing above the present floodplain level. Another type of terrace is cut into bedrock and may have a thin veneer of alluvium, or sedimentary deposits. In paired terraces, the terrace features on each side of a valley correspond.
