Yardang,   large area of soft, poorly consolidated rock and bedrock surfaces that have been extensively grooved, fluted, and pitted by wind erosion. The rock is eroded into alternating ridges and furrows essentially parallel to the dominant wind direction. The relief may range from one to several metres, and there may be unconnected hollows and other irregular shapes. Yardangs occur in various deserts of the world including the Turkistan and the Mojave deserts.
