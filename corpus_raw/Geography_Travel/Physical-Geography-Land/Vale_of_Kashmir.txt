Vale of Kashmir,  intermontane valley, western Jammu and Kashmir union territory, northern India. Lying wholly within the Indian-administered portion of the Kashmir region, it is flanked by the main range of the Himalayas on the northeast and the Pir Panjal Range on the southwest.
The Vale of Kashmir is an ancient lake basin about 85 miles (135 km) long, 20 miles (32 km) wide, and 5,300 feet (1,620 metres) high that is drained by the upper Jhelum River. Lined by mountains that rise 12,000 to 16,000 feet (3,600 to 4,800 metres), the vale is sheltered from the wet southwest monsoon. The population of the Kashmir region is concentrated in the valley, at the centre of which lies Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir. The fertile alluvial soil yields rice, corn (maize), fruit, and vegetables, and the scenic mountains and lakes (notably Wular, Dal, and Nagin) attract many tourists. The valley was the resort of Mughal emperors, notably Jah훮ng카r, who reigned in the early 17th century and constructed picturesque gardens and buildings in the vale for his empress, N큰r Jah훮n.
