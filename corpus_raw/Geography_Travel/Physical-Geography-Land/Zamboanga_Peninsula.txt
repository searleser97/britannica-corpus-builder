Zamboanga Peninsula,   long, semicircular peninsula of western Mindanao, Philippines, extending southwesterly toward the Sulu Archipelago and Borneo. It has an area of roughly 5,600 square miles (14,500 square km). It is bordered on the north and west by the Sulu Sea and on the south by the Moro Gulf.
The peninsula is drained in the north by the Lubungan, Dipolog, and Quipit rivers, and its northern highlands generally descend sharply to the coast. Its southern coastline is deeply indented by the Sibuguey and Dumanquilas embayments. In the north, the most populated region is a lowland area of fertile volcanic material from Mounts Ampiro and Malindang. Agriculture (rice, corn [maize], sugarcane, tobacco, abaca), fishing, and logging are the main economic activities. Small sawmills are scattered along the northern coast. Dipolog, an interisland port, is a commercial-fishing centre and is served by an airport and by coastal roads. The port of Dapitan, a city just northeast of Dipolog, was the place of exile from 1892 to 1896 for the Filipino patriot Jos√© Rizal and is the site of Rizal National Park.
The main rivers in the south of the peninsula are the Subuco, Pangasinan, and Sioco, which form a delta of mangrove forests that are a source of export timber. The largest lowlands and population centres of the south are in and adjacent to Zamboanga City, on the Sibuguey and Baganian peninsulas, and at the heads of the embayments. Forestry, fishing, agriculture (rubber, corn, rice, fruits, vegetables), and mining are important economic activities in the south as in the north. Iron ore and coal are mined near Malangas. In the southeast, Pagadian ships rice and corn to Manila and the Visayas. Although Muslims are a strong minority, most of the inhabitants of the peninsula are Roman Catholic migrants from the Visayas.
