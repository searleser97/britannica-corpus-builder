West Scotia Basin,   submarine trough of the Scotia Sea, an arm of the South Atlantic Ocean, about 500 miles (800 km) southeast of Tierra del Fuego, South America. Its mean depth is about 9,800 feet (3,000 m), and it is some 700 miles (1,130 km) long and 300 miles (480 km) wide. The submerged Scotia Ridge rises to the north of it and the South Shetland Islands to its south. The West Scotia Basin parallels the East Scotia Basin but is separated from it by a slight submerged rise that runs between the island of South Georgia and the South Orkney Islands. A part of the basin floor is covered with a silt that is probably glacial rock flour; the rest of it is largely covered by oozes made up of the skeletons of diatoms and foraminifera; glass and micro-manganese nodules have been found there. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current flows from west to east in the basin.
