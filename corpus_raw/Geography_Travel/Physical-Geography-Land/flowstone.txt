Flowstone,  mineral deposit found in “solution” caves in limestone. Flowing films of water that move along floors or down positive-sloping walls build up layers of calcium carbonate (calcite), gypsum, or other cave minerals. These minerals are dissolved in the water and are deposited when the water loses its dissolved carbon dioxide and therefore its carrying ability. Flowstone is usually white or translucent but may be stained various colours by minerals dissolved in the water.
