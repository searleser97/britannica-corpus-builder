Seventeenth parallel,   the provisional military demarcation line established in Vietnam by the Geneva Accords (1954). The line did not actually coincide with the 17th parallel but ran south of it, approximately along the Ben Hai River to the village of Bo Ho Su and from there due west to the Laos-Vietnam border. Extending for 3 miles (5 km) on either side of the demarcation line was a demilitarized zone (DMZ), also called for by the Geneva agreement.
Although the accords stipulated that the line “should not in any way be interpreted as constituting a political or territorial boundary,” the rest of the agreement was not carried out, and the 17th parallel became the practical political boundary between North and South Vietnam.
