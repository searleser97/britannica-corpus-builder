Kame,   moundlike hill of poorly sorted drift, mostly sand and gravel, deposited at or near the terminus of a glacier. A kame may be produced either as a delta of a meltwater stream or as an accumulation of debris let down onto the ground surface by the melting glacier. A group of closely associated kames is called a kame field, or kame complex, and may be interspersed with kettles or kettle lakes. A kame terrace is produced when a meltwater stream deposits its sediments between the ice mass and the valley wall. In small areas, kames may form the terminal moraine.
