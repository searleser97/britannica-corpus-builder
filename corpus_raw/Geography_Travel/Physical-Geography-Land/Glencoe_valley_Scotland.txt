Glen Coe, also spelled Glencoe,  glen (valley) south of Fort William in the Highland council area of western Scotland. From a relatively low watershed and pass to Glen Etive at an elevation of 1,011 feet (308 metres), Glen Coe runs west for about 5 miles (8 km) as a steep-sided glacier-scoured trough about 0.5 mile (800 metres) wide, bounded by towering mountains with elevations of 3,000 feet (900 metres) or more, before turning northwest as a broader glen opening into the valley of Loch Leven. In February 1692 it was the site of a treacherous clan massacre involving the Macdonalds of Glen Coe. The glen is now almost completely uninhabited.
