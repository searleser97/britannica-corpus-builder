Crowsnest Pass,   pass in the Canadian Rockies at the Alberta–British Columbia border, Canada, 7 mi (11 km) south of Crowsnest Mountain. One of the lower passes of the Continental Divide, it has an elevation of 4,449 ft (1,356 m). Noted by Capt. John Palliser’s expedition in 1858, it was used for many years by the North West Mounted Police. In return for a federal subsidy to build a line through the pass, the Canadian Pacific Railway signed the Crow’s Nest Pass Agreement (1897). This route reduced freight rates on grain shipped east to the lake ports and on certain goods shipped west. The agreement, modified in 1925 to reduce rates on grain shipped in both directions, boosted Vancouver as a grain-shipping port.
