Minahasa,   northeasternmost portion of the longest of the four peninsulas that project from the curiously shaped, mountainous island of Celebes (Sulawesi), Indonesia. The peninsula protrudes northeast between the Celebes and Molucca seas. The name is derived from the Minahasan, a local Malayan tribe that was converted to Christianity in the 19th century. See Celebes.
