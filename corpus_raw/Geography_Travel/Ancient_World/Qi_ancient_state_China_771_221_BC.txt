Qi, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’i,  one of the largest and most powerful of the many small states into which China was divided between about 771 and 221 bc.
In the 7th and 6th centuries bc, Qi, which was located on the extreme eastern edge of the North China Plain in what is now Shandong and Hebei provinces, began to increase in size, expanding at least sixfold by incorporating many previous “barbarian” areas into its realm. Moreover, under the rule of its semi-legendary prince Duke Huan (Qi Huangong) and his famous adviser Guan Zhong, a uniform tax system was instituted, a central army was created, and state monopolies of salt and iron production were formed. At the same time, a centralized bureaucracy based on talent rather than hereditary rank began to grow up. Although all of these changes were not unique to Qi, it was the first state to fully institute all of them.
As a result, Qi began to dominate most of China proper; in 651 bc it formed the little states of the area into a league, which was successful in staving off invasions from the semibarbarian regimes to the north and south. Although Qi thus gained hegemony over China, its rule was short-lived; after Duke Huan’s death, internal disorders caused it to lose the leadership of the new confederation. Meanwhile, other states also began to grow in power.
In the 4th century bc, Qi, under the leadership of a new ruling house, again became a predominant power in Chinese politics, and early in the 3rd century it made an unsuccessful attempt to regain sole hegemony. Thereafter it declined. Finally, in 221 bc the state of Qin absorbed the remnants of Qi, completing the unification of all of China under a strong central government.
