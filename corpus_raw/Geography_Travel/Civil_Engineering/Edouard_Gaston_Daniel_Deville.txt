Édouard Gaston Deville,  (born February 21, 1849, La Charité, France—died September 21, 1924, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), French-born Canadian surveyor of Canadian lands (1875–1924) who perfected the first practical method of photogrammetry, or the making of maps based on photography.
Deville served in the French navy, conducting hydrographic surveys in the South Sea islands, Peru, and elsewhere until 1874. He then went to Canada, where he was appointed (1875) inspector of surveys in the province of Quebec. In 1881 he became inspector of Dominion land surveys and four years later surveyor general. Deville devised a system of making maps by plotting intersections from photographs taken from tripods on the ground. Among his several articles and books is Photographic Surveying (1895).
