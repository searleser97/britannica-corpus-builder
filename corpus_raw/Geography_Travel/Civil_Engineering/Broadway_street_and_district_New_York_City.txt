Broadway,  New York City thoroughfare that traverses the length of Manhattan, near the middle of which are clustered the theatres that have long made it the foremost showcase of commercial stage entertainment in the United States. The term Broadway is virtually synonymous with American theatrical activity.
Broadway gained its name as the axis of an important theatre district in the mid-19th century, attracting impresarios with its central location and fashionable reputation. The number, size, and magnificence of the Broadway theatres grew with New York City’s prosperity and power, and in the 1890s the brilliantly lighted street became known as “the Great White Way.”
Impelled by growing U.S. wealth and cultural aspirations and unrivaled by other forms of popular entertainment, the theatres on Broadway increased in number from about 20 in 1900 to an all-time high of 80 in 1925. The record season of 1927–28 saw 280 new productions open there. Broadway’s fortunes subsequently shifted with those of the nation, and by 1980 only 40 of its theatres remained (few of which were located on Broadway itself; rather, they were east or west of Broadway, generally between 41st and 53rd streets). However, since the 1980s major new stages have drawn theatregoers to Times Square, nearby venues on 42nd Street, and elsewhere along the boulevard. Times Square itself was transformed in the 1990s from a seedy urban core to a brightly lit hub of tourism and high-powered corporate consumerism. See also Off-Broadway.
