Witan, also called Witenagemot,  the council of the Anglo-Saxon kings in and of England; its essential duty was to advise the king on all matters on which he chose to ask its opinion. It attested his grants of land to churches or laymen, consented to his issue of new laws or new statements of ancient custom, and helped him deal with rebels and persons suspected of disaffection. Its composition and time of meeting were determined by the kingâ€™s pleasure.
Usually attended by the greater nobles and bishops, the witan was in no sense a popular assembly. In its composition and duties it closely resembled its successor, the commune concilium of the Anglo-Norman kings, the fundamental difference being that, in the latter body, baronial councillors were bound to the king by feudal ties.
