 Traditionally, the ruler and absolute monarch of Japan was the emperor or empress, even if that person did not have the actual power to govern, and the many de facto leaders of the country throughout history—notably shoguns—always ruled in the name of the monarch. After World War II, with the U.S.-approved constitution of 1947, the emperor officially became a symbol of the state and of the unity of the people. The emperor’s duties have since consisted of mostly formal and ceremonial functions.
