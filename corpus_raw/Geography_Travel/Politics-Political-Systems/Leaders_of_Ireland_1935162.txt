 Until the 17th century, political power in Ireland was shared among small earldoms. Afterward, Ireland effectively became an English colony, and, when the Act of Union came into effect in 1801, Ireland was joined with England and Scotland under the name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1921 the Irish Free State was established as a self-governing dominion of the British Empire, and in 1937 Ireland gained independence. It remained a member of the British Commonwealth until 1948. Over its history, Ireland has had many political leaders with various titles. Since 1937 the head of government of Ireland has been the taoiseach (prime minister).
The table provides a chronological list of the leaders of Ireland since 1922.
