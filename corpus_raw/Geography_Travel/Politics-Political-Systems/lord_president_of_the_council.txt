Lord president of the council,  in the United Kingdom, one of the great officers of state and a member of the ministry who formally directs the privy council. It was only in 1679 that the office of lord president became permanent; previously either the lord chancellor, the lord keeper of the seal, or some particular court official carried out the duties.
The office was of greater direct importance when the powers of the privy council, exercised through various committees, were of wider extent than at the present time. The duties of the office are to preside over the meetings of the privy council and to draw up the minutes of council upon subjects which do not belong to any other department of state. The office is very frequently held in conjunction with other ministerial offices. The lord president is generally a member of the House of Lords and is included in the cabinet.
