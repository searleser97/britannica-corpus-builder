Canton,  political subdivision in France, Switzerland, and other European countries.
In France the canton, a subdivision of the arrondissement, is a territorial division rather than a genuine unit of local government; it is only a convenient administrative subdivision for purposes of elections, tax collection, and the gendarmerie. The cantons were created by a law of Dec. 22, 1789, but their governmental character was taken away by the consular constitution of the year VIII (Dec. 24, 1799).
In Switzerland, canton is the name given to each of the 23 states comprising the Swiss Confederation. Three cantons—Unterwalden, Basel, and Appenzell—are subdivided into demicantons, or half cantons, which function as full cantons; thus, there is often reference to 26 states of Switzerland. Each of the cantons and half cantons has its own constitution, legislature, executive, and judiciary. Glarus and Appenzell Inner-Rhoden have preserved their ancient democratic assemblies (Landsgemeinden), in which all citizens of full age meet annually for the purpose of legislation, taxation, and the election of an annual administrative council and of the members of the cantonal supreme court. In the remaining cantons the legislature (Kantonsrat, Grosser Rat, or Grand Conseil) is composed of representatives chosen by universal suffrage and usually by proportional representation. These councils deal with legislation and all questions not reserved to the federal government. They decide on cantonal taxes and appoint judges as well as cantonal representatives to the federal Ständerat (Council of States) unless the cantonal constitution demands public elections. All cantons have the referendum and the popular initiative, the application of which varies.
