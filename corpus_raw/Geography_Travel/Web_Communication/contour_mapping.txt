Contour mapping,   the delineation of any property in map form by constructing lines of equal values of that property from available data points. A topographic map, for example, reveals the relief of an area by means of contour lines that represent elevation values; each such line passes through points of the same elevation. The method is not wholly objective because two investigators may produce somewhat different maps whenever interpolation between data points is necessary for construction of the contours. In addition to topography, there are scores of geophysical, geochemical, meteorological, sociological, and other variables that are mapped routinely by the method. The availability of plotting devices in recent years has permitted mapping by computer, which reduces the effect of human bias on the final product.
