Bathymetric map,  chart that depicts the submerged topography and physiographic features of ocean and sea bottoms. Individual soundings, or points at which the depth to the seafloor have been measured, are given; however, the principal technique for expressing the submarine topography involves drawing contour lines that connect all measured and extrapolated points at the same depth below sea level.
