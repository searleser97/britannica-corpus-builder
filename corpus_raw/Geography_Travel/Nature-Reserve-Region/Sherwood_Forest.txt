Sherwood Forest,   woodland and former royal hunting ground, county of Nottinghamshire, England, that is well known for its association with Robin Hood, the outlaw hero of medieval legend. Sherwood Forest formerly occupied almost all of western Nottinghamshire and extended into Derbyshire. Today a reduced area of woodland, mostly pine plantations, remains between Nottingham and Worksop. In the north the great ducal estates, or “dukeries,” of Welbeck, Clumber, and Thoresby have preserved parts of the forest. Many veteran oaks remain, and there is much heath. Agricultural encroachment has been limited by the poor, sandy soil. An underlying coalfield has been extensively developed since the mid-19th century.
