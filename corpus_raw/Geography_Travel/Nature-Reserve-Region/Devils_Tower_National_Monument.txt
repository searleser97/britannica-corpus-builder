Devils Tower National Monument, also called Grizzly Bear Lodge,  the first U.S. national monument, established in 1906 in northeastern Wyoming, near the Belle Fourche River. It encompasses 2.1 square miles (5.4 square km) and features a natural rock tower, the remnant of a volcanic intrusion now exposed by erosion.
The tower has a flat top covering 1.5 acres (0.6 hectare) and fluted sides. It is 867 feet (264 metres) high as measured from its base and 1,267 feet (386 metres) as measured from the river valley; its top has an elevation of 5,112 feet (1,558 metres) above sea level. The tower probably formed when molten rock, pushing upward, encountered a hard rock layer and was forced to spread into a flat-topped shape. Its colour is mainly light gray and buff. Lichens cover parts of the tower, and sage, moss, and grass grow on its top. Chipmunks and birds live on the summit, and a pine forest covers some of the surrounding country; there is also a sizable prairie dog town near the base of the tower.
The tower is a sacred site for many Plains Indians as well as a popular site for rock climbing. The month of June is a particularly important time in the Plains religious calendar, when many individuals visit sacred sites to conduct religious services. June is also one of the more popular climbing months. This has created conflict in the past, as some American Indians feel that climbing should be prohibited at the site either permanently or during that month, while some climbers feel this would unfairly restrict their use of public lands. The National Park Service began a voluntary climbing hiatus program at Devils Tower in 1995. Although some individuals continue to climb during June, many have chosen to avoid doing so out of respect for othersâ€™ religious traditions.
