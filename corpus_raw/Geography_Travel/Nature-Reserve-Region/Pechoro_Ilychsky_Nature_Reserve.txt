Pechoro-Ilychsky Nature Reserve,  natural area, set aside for research in the natural sciences, in the low-lying western foothills of the Northern Ural Mountains, near the confluence of the Ilych and Pechora rivers, in northwestern Russia. The reserve was established in 1930, mainly to protect the habitat of the sable and salmon spawning grounds. Covering an area of 1,782,370 acres (721,300 hectares), it lies on a vast plain of sand and morainic loam and is traversed by the Pechora and Ilych rivers, both rising near the summit ridge of the Urals. Caves along the Pechora River have Paleolithic campsites and fossil remains. Vegetation in the lowlands mostly consists of forests of pine; forests of larch and tundra are at higher elevations. Wildlife includes moose, wolf, fox, brown bear, otter, pine martin, wolverine, lynx, elk, reindeer, and birds such as grouse, woodpecker, and nutcracker. The beaver, wiped out in the early 19th century, has been reintroduced.
