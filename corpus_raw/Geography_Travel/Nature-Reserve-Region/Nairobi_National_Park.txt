Nairobi National Park,  national park, in south-central Kenya, 5 miles (8 km) south of Nairobi. It was the first national park established in Kenya (1946), has an area of 45 square miles (117 square km), and lies about 5,000–6,000 feet (1,500–1,800 metres) above sea level. It consists partly of thick woods near the city outskirts, partly of rolling plains and valleys, and partly of a wooded confluence of several rivers. Its vegetation is of the dry transitional savanna type. Acacias and other thorny varieties, muhuhu, Cape chestnut, and Kenya olive are the most important trees. Scores of mammals, such as lions, gazelles, black rhinoceroses, giraffes, various species of antelope, and zebras, as well as numerous reptiles and hundreds of species of birds, inhabit the park. Only by establishing migration routes into nearby Ngong Reserve has it been possible to maintain wildlife in the area at its present levels. The Nairobi Animal Orphanage, founded in 1963, is located inside the park. The park’s headquarters are at Nairobi.
