San Rafael National Park, Spanish Parque Nacional de Turismo Laguna San Rafael,  national park, southern Chile, on the Pacific coast. Established in 1945, it occupies an area of 2,300 sq mi (5,900 sq km). One of its great attractions is Laguna San Rafael (Lake San Rafael), a fjord more than 10 mi (16 km) long between Península de Taitao and the mainland, into which Ventisquero (glacier) San Rafael flows. Created to preserve native fauna and flora from extinction, the park is also of considerable scientific interest to volcanologists. Its windswept canyons and numerous lakes make it a promising tourist and recreation centre. The park is accessible by boat from Aisén or by air.
