Bregenzerwald, English Bregenz Forest,  forested mountain range in western Austria. The range, part of the Allg√§uer Alps, is drained by the Bregenzer Ache (stream) and has been partly deforested. Its hilly Vorderwald (foothill area toward Bregenz) supports pasture and dairy farming, while winter-sports centres and climatic health resorts in its Hinterwald (mountainous interior) make the tourist trade a major economic factor.
