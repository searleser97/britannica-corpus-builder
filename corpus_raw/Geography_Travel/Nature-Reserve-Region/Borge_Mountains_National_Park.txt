Børge Mountains National Park, Norwegian Børgefjell Nasjonalpark,  national park occupying an area of 420 square miles (1,087 square km) in northern Norway.
Designated a national park in 1970, the site consists mostly of granitic mountains with an alpine terrain of cirques and steep-walled valleys. The highest peak in the park is Kvig, reaching 5,587 feet (1,703 metres) above sea level. Lower valleys, hills, and marshes occupy the remainder of the park. Lakes and small rivers are numerous. Birches are the most common trees found in forested areas, and there are small evergreen stands in the south and southwest. Other vegetation includes blueberry heaths, sedge grass, willows, and snow-bed plants.
Many birds inhabit the northern part of the park near the Simskard River, particularly blue throat, red-necked phalarope, long-tailed duck, bean goose, and Teminck’s stint. Snow bunting, ptarmigan, rough-legged buzzard, golden eagle, and osprey live in the mountain areas. Mammals include moose, reindeer, wolverine, lynx, and bear. An abandoned settlement at Fagerneset, on Nams Lake, was inhabited for several hundred years by the Sami, who raised reindeer. Numerous Sami place-names show that they have lived in the region for several hundred years.
