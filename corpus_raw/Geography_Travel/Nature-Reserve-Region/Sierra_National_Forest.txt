Sierra National Forest,  region of forests and streams in central California, U.S., extending along the Sierra Nevada between Yosemite and Kings Canyon national parks (north and southeast, respectively) and bordered by Inyo (northeast), Sequoia (south), and Stanislaus (northwest) national forests. It was established in 1905 from an earlier (1893) forest reserve. It has an area of about 2,030 square miles (5,260 square km) and elevations ranging from 900 to 13,000 feet (275 to 4,000 metres). Notable features include the big trees (giant sequoias) of the Nelder and McKinley groves and the Kaiser, Dinkey Lakes, Monarch, Ansel Adams, and John Muir wilderness areas (the last two shared with Inyo National Forest). Headquarters are at Clovis.
Vegetation ranges from alpine meadows to stands of lodgepole pines, red and white firs, cedars, mountain hemlocks, and aspen. The forest and its streams provide timber, grazing land, water, and hydroelectric power, and there is some gold mining. Wildlife includes mule deer, black bears, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, marmots, porcupines, and quail. Trout, bass, and bluegills are favourite sportfishing species. The Mount Dana–Minarets Escarpment is one of the forest’s scenic highlights, many of its peaks exceeding 12,000 feet (3,700 metres). Hundreds of miles of trails are maintained in the Mammoth–High Sierra area. The highest peak, Mount Humphreys (13,986 feet [4,263 metres]), is on the Sierra Nevada crest. The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail crosses the forest, and Devils Postpile National Monument is near its eastern edge. The Sierra Vista Scenic Byway runs for 100 miles (160 km) past some of the area’s natural highlights. The region offers fishing in numerous cold, clear streams and lakes, as well as bear, deer, and quail hunting. Winter sports such as snowmobiling and skiing are popular, as are aquatic sports such as kayaking and white-water rafting in warm weather.
