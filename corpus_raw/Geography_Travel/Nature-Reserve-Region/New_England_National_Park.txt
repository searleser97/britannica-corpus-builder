New England National Park,  natural area in northeastern New South Wales, Australia. It occupies some 280 square miles (725 square km) on the eastern slope of the New England Range, 45 miles (72 km) east of Armidale. The park was established in 1935 and was named for its climatic and scenic resemblance to England. Point Lookout (5,138 feet [1,566 metres]), the park’s highest elevation, overlooks the headwaters of the Bellingen River and the northern tributaries of the Macleay and Nambucca rivers. The park’s eastern slopes are covered mainly with virgin forest, including heavy stands of red cedar, hoop pine, and tallowwood. Wildlife includes wallabies, kangaroos, gliders, and more than 100 bird species.
