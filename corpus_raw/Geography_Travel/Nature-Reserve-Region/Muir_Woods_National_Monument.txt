Muir Woods National Monument,  one of the two virgin stands of coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) in northern California, U.S., administered by the U.S. National Park Service (the other being Redwood National Park). The small groves of the giant trees lie near the Pacific Ocean coast at the foot of Mount Tamalpais, about 15 miles (25 km) northwest of San Francisco. Some of these trees are over 250 feet (75 metres) high and nearly 15 feet (4.5 metres) in diameter; the oldest are more than 1,000 years old. Other typical trees in Muir Woods include Douglas firs, big-leaf maples, and tanbark oaks. Lush growths of ferns are common on the forest floor.
The core 295 acres (120 hectares) of the present forest, established as a national monument in 1908, was a gift of Congressman William Kent and his wife, Elizabeth Thacher Kent. It was named in honour of naturalist John Muir, renowned advocate of forest conservation in the United States. The monument now has an area of 554 acres (225 hectares) and includes 6 miles (10 km) of walking trails; those along the canyon floor next to Redwood Creek are paved. Muir Woods is surrounded by Mount Tamalpais State Park and is administered as part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
