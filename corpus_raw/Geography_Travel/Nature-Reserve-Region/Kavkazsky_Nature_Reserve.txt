Kavkazsky Nature Reserve,   natural area set aside for research in the natural sciences, at the western end of the Caucasus Mountains, in southwestern Russia. It includes the upper reaches of the Malaya Laba, Bolshaya Laba, Mzymta, and Shakhe rivers. The Kavkazsky Nature Reserve was established in 1924 and has an area of 1,017 square miles (2,633 square km). It is within a folded-mountain region subjected to the action of glaciers and snow; the rocks are mostly crystalline granites and gneisses. At low elevations forests of beech and oak prevail, and at higher elevations extensive forests of fir are found; higher still is rhododendron, and above this, alpine meadows. The reserveâ€™s wildlife includes brown bear, wild pig, lynx, red deer, Caucasian tur (a type of wild goat), chamois, wolf, and the European bison, which has been reintroduced. Bird species include the Caucasian blackcock, Caucasian snowcock, and alpine chough. The reserve is used for scientific research concentrating on reacclimatization studies of the European bison and on the preservation of Caucasian flora and fauna.
