Gaspesian Provincial Park, French Parc Provincial De La Gaspésie,  park in eastern Quebec province, Canada. The park occupies 500 square miles (1,295 square km) on the Gaspé Peninsula, near the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. It was established in 1937 to protect the fast-diminishing herds of caribou as well as to preserve the natural beauty of the region, which is heavily wooded with many lakes and streams. Extending from east to west are the Monts Chic-Choc (Shickshock Mountains), with some rare species of Alpine flora; Mount Jacques Cartier (4,160 feet [1,268 m]) is the highest peak. The park’s domain includes Port-Daniel (southeast), the Saint-Jean-Rivière district (east), the Lapetite-Cascapédia-Rivière (south), and the Matane River country (west)—all of which are well known for salmon fishing.
