Tongue-tie, also called Ankyloglossia,  congenital shortening of the flap of mucous membrane (frenum) beneath the tongue, a condition that sometimes interferes with protrusion of the tongue. The name comes from the belief, of folk origin, that the anomaly is the cause of speaking or feeding difficulties. Medical studies suggest that such shortening of the frenum is a normal variation that does not interfere with either feeding or speaking and usually needs no treatment.
