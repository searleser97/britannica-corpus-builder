Field of Cloth of Gold,  in European history, the meeting place, between Guînes and Ardres near Calais in France, where Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France and their entourages gathered between June 7 and 24, 1520. The castles at both villages were in decay, and therefore splendid temporary palaces and pavilions were erected for Henry at Guînes and for Francis at Ardres. Henry’s palace covered nearly 2.5 acres (1 hectare) and was sumptuously decorated; it contained a great hall and a spacious chapel; and, outside, a gilt fountain spouted claret, hippocras (spiced wine), and water through separate runlets.
The kings first met at the Val Doré, midway between the two camps, on June 7. The subsequent meetings and entertainments were conducted with much apparent cordiality, although “many persons present could not understand each other.” There were jousts and mummers, and on the last day, Sunday, June 24, sections of the mass were sung alternately in French and English. Although its splendour made the meeting vastly impressive to contemporaries, its political result was negligible. Henry met the Holy Roman emperor Charles V, Francis’ rival, at Gravelines near Calais on July 10, and each agreed to make no fresh alliance with France for two years.
