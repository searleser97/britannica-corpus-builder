Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument,  archaeological site in southwestern New Mexico, U.S., in the Gila National Forest near the headwaters of the Gila River. The name Gila is derived from the Yuma Indian term hahquahssael, meaning “salty water running.” The monument lies in rugged country about 30 miles (50 km) north of Silver City. It contains groups of small but well-preserved dwellings built of stone masonry in natural cavities of an overhanging cliff 150 feet (45 metres) high. The dwellings were inhabited from about ad 1280 to the early 14th century by peoples of the Mogollon culture. The ruins of earlier dwellings also have been found there, the oldest of these dating to about ad 100. The monument, established in 1907, occupies an area of 0.8 square mile (2 square km).
