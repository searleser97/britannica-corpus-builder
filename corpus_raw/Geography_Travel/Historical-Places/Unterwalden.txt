Unterwalden,   former canton, central Switzerland; it occupied the basins of the Sarner Aa (river) and the Engelberger Aa. The former canton is divided (east and west) into two sovereign half cantons—Nidwalden and Obwalden—based on the medieval distinction between the upper and lower river valleys. Unterwalden was included in the Zürichgau (district) and was ruled after 1173 by the Habsburg counts, acting as the representatives of the German king. In 1291, with Uri and Schwyz, it formed the Everlasting League that became the nucleus of the Swiss Confederation. In 1340 Unterwalden divided itself into Nidwalden and Obwalden. Although continuing to maintain their distinct identities, Nidwalden and Obwalden usually acted in concert as Unterwalden canton. In 1803 they became half cantons having equal rights.
