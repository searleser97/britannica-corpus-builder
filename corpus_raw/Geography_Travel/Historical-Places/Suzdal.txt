Suzdal, in full Suzdal Principality, Russian in full Suzdalskoye Knyazhestvo,  medieval principality that occupied the area between the Oka River and the Upper Volga in northeastern Russia. During the 12th to 14th centuries, Suzdal was under the rule of a branch of the Rurik dynasty. As one of the successor regions to Kiev, the principality achieved great political and economic importance, first becoming prominent during the reign of Andrey Bogolyubsky (1157–74), who conquered Kiev (1169) and transferred the title of “grand prince” from that ancient capital first to Suzdal, then to Vladimir, his new capital on the Klyazma River. He and his brother and successor, Vsevolod III (1176–1212), organized a strong monarchical political system and, as rulers of the Grand Principality of Vladimir, became the most powerful of the Russian princes. They encouraged their subordinate princes to develop the principality and to build churches, palaces, and new cities.
But the Suzdal princes came to regard their territories as private, hereditary property, and, contrary to Russian custom, they divided it among their heirs. Suzdal–Vladimir thus disintegrated into small principalities (13th and 14th centuries), which nominally recognized the seniority of the grand prince of Vladimir. After the Tatar invasion (1237–40), they became subject to the Golden Horde. Prince Konstantin Vasilyevich (1332–55) attempted to rebuild the area of Suzdal and Nizhny Novgorod, which the Tatar khan Jani Beg had made into a new grand duchy (c. 1342). His son Dmitry was briefly the grand prince of Vladimir (1359–62). Nevertheless, the title of grand prince soon reverted to the princes of Moscow, and in 1392 Prince Vasily I Dmitriyevich of Moscow annexed the Suzdal–Nizhny Novgorod region.
