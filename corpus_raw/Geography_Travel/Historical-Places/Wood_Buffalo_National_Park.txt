Wood Buffalo National Park,  park in northern Alberta and southern Northwest Territories, Canada, between Athabasca and Great Slave lakes. It has an area of 17,300 sq mi (44,807 sq km) and was established in 1922 as a refuge to protect the few remaining bison herds in northern Canada. A vast region of forests and plains crossed by the Peace River, it has many lakes (including Lake Claire). It is the habitat of both plains and wood buffalo (bison), as well as of bears, caribou, moose, deer, and beavers. In the park are the only remaining nesting grounds for the whooping crane, the tallest native North American bird, which is dangerously close to extinction. Because of its rare animal population and abundant natural resources, the park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.
