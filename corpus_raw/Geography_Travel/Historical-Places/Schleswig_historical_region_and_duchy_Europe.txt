Schleswig,  historic and cultural region occupying the southern part of the Jutland Peninsula north of the Eider River. It encompasses the northern half of Schleswig-Holstein Land (state) in northern Germany and Sønderjylland region in southern Denmark.
Schleswig became a Danish duchy in the 12th century and remained a fief associated with Denmark until it was forcibly annexed by Austria and Prussia after the German-Danish War (1864). After the Seven Weeks’ War (1866), Schleswig was incorporated with Holstein as a single Prussian province. Following World War I, the Danish majority living in North Schleswig (north of Flensburg) voted for incorporation with Denmark in a plebiscite (1920) held in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles.
Evidence of the struggle between the Danes and Germans from the 9th to the 12th century lies west of the town of Schleswig. Here the Danish kings built an impressive fortification wall known as the Danewerk. Nearby are the ruins of Haithabu, a historic Viking trading settlement. Evidence of both German and Danish cultural influences abound throughout Schleswig. Scandinavian place-names are mixed with German names throughout the lands north of the Eider, where dispersed farms and small hamlets are predominant. Danish farms, however, do not extend south of the city of Schleswig. The area from Schleswig north to Flensburg has a mixture of Saxon and Danish farmhouses, while north of Flensburg the Jutish rectangular enclosed farmstead is most common. The majority of the people in the German portion of Schleswig speak a Low German dialect, while the majority in the Danish portion of the region speak Danish.
