Wolof empire, also spelled Ouolof,   (fl. 14th–16th century), state that dominated what is now inland Senegal during the early period of European contact with West Africa. Founded soon after 1200, the Wolof state was ruled by a king, or burba, whose duties were both political and religious. During the 14th century, it began to develop satellite states, of which the most important was Cayor. During the 15th century Wolof was a powerful empire, on the border of which lay the tributary state of Sine-Solum, ruled by the Serer, a kindred people to the Wolof.
With the advent of the Portuguese in about 1440, the Wolof were drawn first into a profitable trading partnership and then into a political alliance—though they remained sufficiently independent to repel Portugal’s more blatant attempts at infiltration.
In 1556 the nobles of Cayor threw off Wolof domination and established an independent state of their own on the Senegal coast. This action cut off Wolof ’s access to the sea and to the European trade; its importance subsequently declined.
