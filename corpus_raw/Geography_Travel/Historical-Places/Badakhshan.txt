Badakhshān,   historic region of northeastern Afghanistan, roughly encompassing the northern spurs of the Hindu Kush and chiefly drained by the Kowkcheh River. Mountain glaciers and glacial lakes are found in the higher elevations of the region.
The name Badakhshān first appears in Chinese writings of the 7th and 8th centuries ad, before which the area was ruled successively by Hephthalites, Turks, and Arabs. From the 13th century, after several changes of possession, a local dynasty claiming descent from Alexander the Great ruled until the Timurids took over in the 15th century. In 1584 the Uzbeks conquered Badakhshān, and it remained under local Uzbek mīrs (“leaders”) until 1822, when Morād Beg of Kondūz overran it. In 1859 Badakhshān became tributary to Kābul, and its autonomy ended in 1881. A British-Russian accord (1895) delineated the Panj River as part of the Russo-Afghan border separating Afghan Badakhshān from Russian Badakhshān in the Pamirs. After the Russian Revolution (1917), this Pamir region became the Gorno-Badakhshān autonomous oblast, part of the Tadzhik S.S.R. (Tajikistan after 1991). In the 1979 Soviet military intervention, the Afghan towns of Feyẕābād and Eshkāshem were captured from Afghan guerrillas, and in 1980 the Soviets established a military command at Feyẕābād.
Agriculture is the chief occupation in Badakhshān. Irrigation in the valleys permits the growing of rice, wheat, corn (maize), and cotton, while barley and legumes are produced in the hills. Grapes, fruit trees, and nuts are also grown, and livestock are raised for wool and skins. There is some mineral wealth in the region, including unexploited sulfur deposits, and precious stones, including lapis lazuli, which has been mined for more than 4,000 years at Shar Shākh.
