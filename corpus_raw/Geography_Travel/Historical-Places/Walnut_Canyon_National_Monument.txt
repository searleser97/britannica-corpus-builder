Walnut Canyon National Monument,  archaeological site and natural area in north-central Arizona, U.S., on Walnut Creek, 10 miles (16 km) east-southeast of Flagstaff. Established in 1915, it has an area of 6 square miles (15 square km).
Its central feature is Walnut Canyon, which winds for 20 miles (32 km) through the monument and reaches depths of 400 feet (120 metres). The monument preserves more than 300 pre-Columbian dwellings (rooms) built by the Sinagua Indians (a Pueblo people) in shallow caves on the canyon walls and protected by overhanging ledges. Main occupancy was from approximately ad 1100 to 1250. Well supplied with fresh water, the Indians lived chiefly by farming the mesa tops. The monument has a museum and a panoramic view at the visitor centre. Five vegetation zones are found in the monument: a riparian community of black walnut trees, Sonoran Desert vegetation, pi√±on pine and juniper woodland, mixed conifer forest, and ponderosa pine forest.
