Kingdom of the Two Sicilies,  the state that united the southern part of the Italian peninsula with the island of Sicily between the mid-15th and the mid-19th centuries. (For a brief history of the state, see Naples, Kingdom of.) United by the Normans in the 11th century, the two areas were divided in 1282 between the Angevin (French) dynasty on the mainland and the Aragonese (Spanish) dynasty on the island, both of which claimed the title of king of Sicily. In 1443 Alfonso V of Aragon, on reuniting the two portions, took the title of rex Utriusque Siciliae (king of the Two Sicilies). This title was sometimes used during the Spanish and Bourbon rule of the two areas, from the 16th to the 19th century; it became official in 1815, when the administration of both areas was combined, and Sicily lost its autonomy.
