Anglo-Egyptian Condominium,  the joint British and Egyptian government that ruled the eastern Sudan from 1899 to 1955. It was established by the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreements of January 19 and July 10, 1899, and, with some later modifications, lasted until the formation of the sovereign, independent Republic of the Sudan on January 1, 1956. (The Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1953 had outlined the steps to be taken for Sudanese self-rule and self-determination.)
The Condominium agreements established an office of governor-general, to be appointed, on British recommendation, by the khedive of Egypt and vested with supreme civil and military command. In theory Egypt shared a governing role, but in practice the structure of the Condominium ensured full British control over the Sudan. The governors and inspectors were customarily British officers, though technically serving in the Egyptian Army, and key figures in the government and civil service always remained graduates of British universities and military schools.
