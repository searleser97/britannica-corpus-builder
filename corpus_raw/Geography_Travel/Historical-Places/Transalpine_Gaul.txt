Transalpine Gaul, Latin Gallia Transalpina,  in Roman antiquity, the land bounded by the Alps, the Mediterranean, the Pyrenees, the Atlantic, and the Rhine. It embraced what is now France and Belgium, along with parts of Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.
The Romans first ventured into Transalpine Gaul in 121 bce to subdue the Celtic tribes along the Mediterranean coast. All of Transalpine Gaul was annexed by Julius Caesar after the Gallic Wars (58–50 bce). Augustus later divided Transalpine Gaul into four provinces. Narbonensis, situated along the Mediterranean, became a senatorial province with stronger cultural and political ties to Italy than the rest of Gaul. The remaining territory was called Gallia Comata; Augustus divided it into three imperial provinces—Belgica, Lugdunensis, and Aquitania.
