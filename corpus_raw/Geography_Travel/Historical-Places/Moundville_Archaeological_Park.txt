Moundville Archaeological Park,  habitation site (from ad 1000 to 1450) of Native American farmers and pottery makers, near Moundville, western Alabama, U.S. It lies on a plain above the Black Warrior River, 14 miles (23 km) south of Tuscaloosa.
Archaeological excavations date from the mid-19th century, with work being done by Clarence B. Moore in the early 20th century. Large-scale excavations were carried out by the Alabama Museum of Natural History in the 1930s and early ’40s.
The park now encompasses 320 acres (130 hectares) and is operated by the University of Alabama. It contains some two dozen flat-topped earth mounds that were used as foundations for dwellings. The largest, Mound B (58 feet [18 metres] high and about 2 acres [0.8 hectare] at its base), was the foundation of a temple. A museum containing exhibits and burials was built in 1939; the burials were closed in 1989. The Indian Village depicts the daily life of the site’s original inhabitants, and a Native American Festival is held annually.
