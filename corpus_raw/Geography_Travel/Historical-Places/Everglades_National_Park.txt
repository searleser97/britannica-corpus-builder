Everglades National Park,  large natural area encompassing the southwestern portion of the more extensive Everglades region in southern Florida, U.S. It constitutes the largest subtropical wilderness left in the United States.
The park was authorized in 1934, but, because of difficulties acquiring land, it was not established until 1947. UNESCO designated it (along with Dry Tortugas National Park) a Biosphere Reserve in 1976 and a World Heritage site in 1979. The park’s area has been expanded several times, most recently in 1989. It encompasses 2,357 square miles (6,105 square km), including most of Florida Bay, and preserves a unique blend of temperate and tropical species and freshwater and marine habitats. Part of its northern border adjoins Big Cypress National Preserve. Biscayne National Park is to the east, off the Atlantic coast, and Dry Tortugas National Park lies to the southwest, at the western end of the Florida Keys.
Everglades National Park’s several visitor centres have natural history exhibits. The park is popular with boating and canoeing enthusiasts; there are several marked canoe trails, including the 99-mile (159-km) Wilderness Waterway along the park’s western side. In addition, private companies offer guided tram and boat tours in portions of the park. Forested areas and the main visitor centre suffered damage from Hurricane Andrew in 1992. As a result of that storm, the park was on UNESCO’s List of World Heritage in Danger from 1993 to 2007. In 2010 it was again added to the list, because of concerns about decreases in water flowing into the Everglades and increases in pollution levels there.
