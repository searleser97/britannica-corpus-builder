Dithmarschen, Danish Ditmarsken,  area on the west coast of the Jutland peninsula between the Eider and Elbe rivers, now included in the Land (state) of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, but down to 1866 a semi-independent territory under the king of Denmark. First mentioned in the 9th century, Dithmarschen was then one of the three Saxon districts north of the Elbe. In 1144 the ruling count was killed in a popular rising, and, after a dispute between the Duke of Saxony and the Archbishop of Bremen, Dithmarschen passed to the latter.
In 1434 the federated parishes created a central judiciary that developed into an administration by 48 regents, and in 1447 the customary laws were codified. In 1473 the Holy Roman emperor Frederick III enfeoffed Christian I of Denmark with Dithmarschen, but the Danish kingsâ€™ attempts to make good this grant ended in humiliating defeat at Hemmingstedt (February 1500). In 1580 the province was divided into royal South Dithmarschen and ducal (Gottorp) North Dithmarschen; these districts remained even when in 1773 the whole territory fell to the king of Denmark. In 1867 Dithmarschen, together with Schleswig and Holstein, became Prussian.
