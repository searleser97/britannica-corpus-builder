Clergy Reserves,   lands formerly set aside for the Church of England in Canada, a cause of controversy in 19th-century Canadian politics. Established by the Constitutional Act of 1791 “for the support and maintenance of a Protestant clergy,” the Clergy Reserves amounted to one-seventh of all land grants. The phrase “a Protestant clergy” was interpreted as referring exclusively to the Church of England.
In Upper Canada (now in Ontario), where a majority of Protestants were non-Anglican, controversy over the Clergy Reserves arose soon after the conclusion of the War of 1812. In 1822 the Church of Scotland demanded a share in the Clergy Reserves. Most other denominations denounced their existence as inimical to religious liberties and demanded their application to general public purposes, such as education.
An imperial act of 1827 allowed for the sale of one-fourth of the reserved land. In 1840 another imperial act forbade the creation of any new reserves; divided the income from past sales among the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, and the Wesleyan Methodists; and left the income from future sales to be divided among other denominations.
The Clergy Reserves were finally secularized in 1854. At the same time, a large cash payment was made to the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, and the Wesleyan Methodists as acknowledgment of their “vested interests” in the Clergy Reserves.
