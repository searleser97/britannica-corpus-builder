Algarve,  historical province of southern Portugal, bounded by the Atlantic Ocean (south and west) and the lower Guadiana River (east). Much of the interior upland region is of low productivity and is sparsely populated; the fertile coastal lowland is more densely inhabited.
The Phoenicians established bases in the area, and the Romans later conquered it; Visigoths ruled the region until Muslims took control in the early 8th century. After nearly five centuries of Muslim rule, Algarve (Arabic: Al-Gharb, “the west”) was taken into the Portuguese kingdom in 1189, but it retains some of its Moorish characteristics. At Sagres in 1419 Henry the Navigator founded a centre of research that came to be called a school of navigation.
The region has a warm climate and numerous fine beaches, contributing to its popularity as a holiday destination. The economy is heavily dependent on tourism, which has vastly expanded in recent years and in significant ways altered the landscape. The building of hotels, apartment blocks, and residential housing has been extensive. Moreover, many golf course have also been created along the coast. Fishing (for sardines, horse mackerel, and other types of fish) and fish processing continue, and other industries include wine and cork processing. Agriculture, once vital to the region’s economy and based on the cultivation of figs, almonds, olives, oranges, grapes, and carobs, has declined.
