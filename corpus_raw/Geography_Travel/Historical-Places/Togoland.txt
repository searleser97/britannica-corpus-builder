Togoland,  former German protectorate, western Africa, now divided between the Republics of Togo and Ghana.
Togoland covered 34,934 square miles (90,479 square km) between the British Gold Coast colony to the west and French Dahomey to the east. Inhabited by a mixture of Ewe and other peoples, it became a political unit in 1884, when, in the European scramble for overseas territories, German chancellor Otto von Bismarck claimed it for Germany and other European powers formally recognized the claim. The Germans intended to make Togoland a model colony. Because the region lacked mineral resources (its phosphate reserves were not then known), Germany concentrated on agricultural development. Valuable oil palms grew naturally near the coast. The Germans introduced additional export crops, especially cacao and cotton, to be grown on plantations worked by African labour. Lomé, on the Gulf of Guinea, was developed as the principal town and port, and roads and railways were constructed to link the port to parts of the interior. The Germans also established a judicial and administrative system. The infrastructure, designed to serve German needs, brought some unity to the protectorate.
During World War I France and Britain occupied the protectorate, and in 1922 it was formally divided between them under a League of Nations mandate. Two-thirds of the land and people, including Lomé, became French Togoland, bordering Dahomey. The remainder in the west, bordering the Gold Coast, became British Togoland. In 1946 the two Togolands became United Nations trust territories. The British part was administered with the Gold Coast and became part of independent Ghana in 1957, but French Togoland remained administratively distinct from Dahomey (now Benin) and became independent as the Republic of Togo in 1960. Lingering sentiment for the reunification of Togoland, especially among Ewe people in Ghana, has occasionally strained relations between Togo and Ghana since independence.
