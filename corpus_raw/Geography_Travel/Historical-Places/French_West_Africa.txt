French West Africa, French Afrique Occidentale Française (AOF),  administrative grouping under French rule from 1895 until 1958 of the former French territories of West Africa: Senegal, French Guinea, the Ivory Coast, and the French Sudan, to which Dahomey was added in 1899. Certain territories of the Sudan were grouped together under the name Senegambia and Niger (Sénégambie-Niger; 1903), which was transformed into Upper Senegal and Niger (Haut-Sénégal-Niger; 1904). At the same time, Mauritania (Maurétanie) was added to French West Africa. The colony of Upper Volta (Haute-Volta), founded in 1909 and attached in 1932 to the Ivory Coast, was reestablished as a territory of the federation in 1947. Upper Senegal and Niger was renamed the French Sudan in 1920. By 1960 the formerly colonial territories had become independent republics, with French Sudan changing its name to Mali. Upper Volta was renamed Burkina Faso in 1984.
