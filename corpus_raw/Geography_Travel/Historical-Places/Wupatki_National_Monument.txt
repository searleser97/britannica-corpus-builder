Wupatki National Monument,  desert area of archaeological sites in north-central Arizona, U.S. It lies along the Little Colorado River near the San Francisco Mountains, 30 miles (48 km) north-northeast of Flagstaff and about 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument. Established in 1924, the monument has an area of 55 square miles (142 square km).
The monument comprises more than 800 pre-Columbian red sandstone pueblos, including an oval amphitheatre and a circular ball court. Studies of tree rings in their ancient wooden beams indicate that the pueblos, ranging in size from one-story, single-family houses to multilevel dwellings (one with more than 100 rooms), were built between the 11th and the 13th century. Their occupants were farming Native Americans (Sinagua, Kayenta Ancestral Pueblo [Anasazi], and Cohonina), who came with corn (maize) seed and digging sticks to cultivate the cinder soils that covered the region after the eruption in 1064â€“65 of nearby Sunset Crater. The outstanding groups of pueblos are the Wupatki and the Citadel, the latter built near the rim of a sinkhole. A loop road links the two monuments.
