Foix,  feudal county of southwestern France, corresponding approximately to the modern département of Ariège, in the Midi-Pyrénées région. Between the 11th and the 15th century, the counts of Foix built up a quasi-independent power bounded by Languedoc on the north and on the east, by the territories of the counts of Roussillon and of the kings of Aragon on the south, and by those of the counts of Comminges and of Armagnac on the west.
At the beginning of the 11th century the town of Foix, from which the county took its name, belonged to the counts of Carcassonne. In his will (1002), Roger I of Carcassonne left “the land of Foix,” Consérans (Cousérans), and some adjacent domains to his second son, Bernard, who was styled count of Consérans and lord of Foix. The first count of Foix was this Bernard’s second son, Roger I (died c. 1064), whose descendants held the countship for three centuries. The most famous of this line was Gaston III Phoebus. On the death of his successor in 1398, the countship passed to a collateral line, Foix-Grailly, which in the 15th century became involved through marriage in the affairs of Navarre. As a result of family alliances, Foix, Béarn, and Navarre passed to the House of Albret in 1484. The heiress Jeanne d’Albret (1528–72), by her marriage to Anthony of Bourbon, passed her possessions on to her son, the future Henry IV of France. On his accession (1589) Foix became part of the crown lands.
