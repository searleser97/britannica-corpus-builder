Dbus-Gtsang,  one of three historical regions of Central Asia (the other two being A-mdo and Khams) into which Tibet was once divided.
Dbus and Gtsang were provinces in the days of the early kings of central Tibet (c. 7th century ce). The area of Dbus encompassed the Skyid-chu valley system in which Lhasa is located, as well as the Yar-klungs and ’Phyong-rgyas valleys on the south side of the Brahmaputra River (called the Tsang-po, or Yarlung Zangbo, in Tibet), which together were the ancient regions of the Tibetan royal court. West of Dbus was the province of Gtsang. Its area embraced several river valleys that converge with that of the Brahmaputra. Chief among these is the Nyang Chu River valley, which runs from the northwest to the southeast for some 150 miles (240 km) before it enters the Brahmaputra. The Nyang Chu flows past the fortress town of Gyangzê and past Xigazê, the former administrative headquarters of Gtsang.
During the 7th to 9th centuries the Tibetan kingdom was extended until it reached the Tarim Basin to the north, China to the east, India and Nepal to the south, and the Kashmir region to the west. The newly added dominions to the west were called Mnga’-ris, and those to the east and northeast were called Mdo-khams. This vast area marked the limits of the Tibetan empire before its collapse in the 9th century. Today the traditional region of Dbus-Gtsang is considered to stretch from Mnga’-ris skir-gsum at the border of Kashmir to Sog-la skya-bo near the town of Sog (Zaindainxoi, or Suoxian), encompassing most of the Tibet Autonomous Region of western China.
