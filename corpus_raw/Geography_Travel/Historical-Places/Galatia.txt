Galatia,   ancient district in central Anatolia that was occupied early in the 3rd century bc by Celtic tribes, whose bands of marauders created havoc among neighbouring Hellenistic states. Invited from Europe to participate in a Bithynian civil war (278 bc), the Gallic horde plagued western Anatolia until checked by the Seleucid king Antiochus I at the so-called Elephant Battle (275 bc). At that point the Celts, called Galatae (Galatians) by 3rd-century writers, settled in the territory to which they gave their name. The Galatians, having joined the Seleucids against Rome (winter 190â€“189 bc), brought upon themselves a Roman punitive expedition (189 bc) from which they never recovered. Passing successively under the rule of Pergamum and Pontus, Galatia became a Roman protectorate (85 bc) ruled by puppet kings. Though originally possessing a strong cultural identity, the Galatians by the 2nd century ad had become absorbed into the Hellenistic civilization of Anatolia.
