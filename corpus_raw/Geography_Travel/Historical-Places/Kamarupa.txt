Kamarupa, also called Kamrup or Kamata,  ancient Indian state corresponding roughly to what is now the state of Assam, in northeastern India. This region had many rulers but, being protected by natural fortifications, maintained fairly consistent territorial boundaries.
Kamarupa was ruled by at least three dynasties from about 350 to the mid-12th century ce. Although it began as a feudatory state of the Gupta empire from the 6th century, Kamarupa existed as an independent kingdom. Although several Muslim invasions were repelled in the 13th century, in the same period the area was infiltrated from the east by the Ahom tribe of northern Myanmar (Burma), who slowly progressed westward in their control of the region. The Ahom referred to the region as Assam (or possibly Asama), and this term eventually supplanted Kamarupa as the accepted name for the area. Having a unique mix of South Asian and East Asian cultures, Kamarupa was the seat of evolution for the Tantric form of Hinduism, including at the Kamakhya temple complex in Guwahati.
