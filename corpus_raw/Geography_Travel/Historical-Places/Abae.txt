Abae,   ancient town in the northeast corner of Phocis, Greece. The town was famous for its oracle of Apollo, which was one of those consulted by the Lydian king Croesus. Although the Persians sacked and burned the temple in 480 bc, the oracle continued to be consulted—e.g., by the Thebans before the Battle of Leuctra (371 bc). The temple, burned again during the Sacred War (355–346 bc), was partly restored by the Roman emperor Hadrian. Ruins of the town walls and the acropolis remain on the town’s site.
