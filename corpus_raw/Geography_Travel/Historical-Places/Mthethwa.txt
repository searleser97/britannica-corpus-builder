Mthethwa, also spelled Mtetwa,  important chieftaincy and small historical state of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, located south of the lower Mfolozi River in the northeastern part of the present-day province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. Under chiefs from the Nyambose lineage, particularly Jobe and his son Dingiswayo, Mthethwa became prominent in the first two decades of the 19th century by absorbing small local lineages and by engaging in conflicts with neighbouring chieftaincies engaged in similar expansionist processes, such as the Qwabe chieftaincy to the south and the Ndwandwe group to the northwest.
The Nyambose of Mthethwa were involved in trade with the Portuguese at Delagoa Bay. Between the 1750s and the 1820s, the most important exports out of this region of Africa were elephant ivory, slaves, and perhaps cattle. In the 1810s Portuguese soldiers and Dingiswayo reportedly had an alliance, and firearms for Mthethwa were imported via Delagoa Bay.
Under Dingiswayo, Mthethwa established close links with the Zulu chieftaincy to its west. After Dingiswayoâ€™s death (c. 1817), Mthethwa fused with the Zulu and several other groups in the subregion to form the Zulu kingdom under Shaka. Descendants of the Nyambose became chiefs under a succession of Zulu kings.
Many military and administrative innovations, including the system of age regiments (amabutho) that later characterized the Zulu kingdom, were utilized by Mthethwa, although an older theory that credits the Nyambose rulers of Mthethwa with the introduction of amabutho is no longer accepted because of evidence for the widespread existence of amabutho going back into the 18th century and perhaps earlier.
