Marche,   French province before the Revolution of 1789 corresponding roughly to the modern département of Creuse, with a small fragment of Indre and much of northern Haute-Vienne.
In ancient times the country was part of Limousin, from which it was detached in the middle of the 10th century to form a separate frontier countship (march) to protect Poitou and the rest of the duchy of Aquitaine against invasion from the north. During the 12th and 13th centuries, a chain of fiefs depending directly on Poitiers, interspersed with ecclesiastical lordships, grew up to cut the countship practically into western and eastern halves, basse Marche and haute Marche. Held by a junior line of the Bourbons from 1342 to 1435 and by a junior line of the Armagnacs from 1435 to 1477, the countship later went to Pierre II, duc de Bourbon (sire de Beaujeu), and then to the constable Charles, duc de Bourbon. Confiscated by Francis I of France in 1527, it was granted successively to the widows of French kings from 1574 to 1643. From the late 17th century until the end of the ancien régime, the title was borne by the sons of the princes de Conti.
Administratively, basse Marche was from 1586 under the intendant of Limoges, and haute Marche was under the intendant of Moulins (Bourbonnais); judicially, the whole province depended on the Parlement of Paris.
