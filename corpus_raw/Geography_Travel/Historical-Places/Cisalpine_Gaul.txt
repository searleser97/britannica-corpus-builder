Cisalpine Gaul, Latin Gallia Cisalpina,  in ancient Roman times, that part of northern Italy between the Apennines and the Alps settled by Celtic tribes. Rome conquered the Celts between 224 and 220 bc, extending its northeastern frontier to the Julian Alps.
When Hannibal invaded Italy in 218 bc, the Celts joined his forces, and Rome thereby lost this territory. It was recovered, however, during the final conquest of the Celtic Insubres and Boii between 198 and 191 bc. In 42 bc the province was incorporated into Italy.
