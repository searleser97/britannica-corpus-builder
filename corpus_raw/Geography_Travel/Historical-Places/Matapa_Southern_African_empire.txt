Matapa, also known as the empire of the Mwene Matapa; Matapa also spelled Mutapa,  a Southern African empire ruled by a line of kings known as the Mwene Matapa. Matapa encompassed the territory between the Zambezi and Limpopo rivers, in what is now Zimbabwe and Mozambique, from the 14th to the 17th century. It is associated with the historical site known as Great Zimbabwe.
Oral traditions ascribe the dynastyâ€™s foundation to Mbire, a semimythical ruler of the 14th century. His great-great-grandson Nyatsimba, who ruled in the late 15th century, was the actual creator of the empire. During his reign the centre of the state was shifted from Zimbabwe north to Mount Fura on the Zambezi River. In the 16th century the Matapa empire was invaded by the Portuguese, who moved in from the east coast beginning in the 1530s. When the reigning Mwene Matapa attempted to expel them in 1629, they deposed him and forced his successor to grant them extensive trading and mining privileges. By the late 17th century, the Matapa empire was overshadowed by the Rozwi empire of southwestern Rhodesia.
