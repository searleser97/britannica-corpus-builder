Baol,   in the 14th century, a satellite state of the Wolof empire of West Africa. Situated along the coast and inland to the south of Dakar in present Senegal, it was conquered some time after 1556 by the neighbouring state of Cayor, which controlled it until 1686. Late in the 17th century, Wolof invaded Cayor, causing many of its inhabitants to flee to Baol. The rulers of Baol were able to withstand European attempts at conquest until the French occupied their territory in the mid-19th century.
