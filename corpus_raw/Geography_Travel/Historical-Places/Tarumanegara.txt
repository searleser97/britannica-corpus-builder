Tarumanegara, also called Taruma,  the oldest recorded kingdom in western Java. It was established about the 5th century ad, but little is recorded about the kingdom except for a sketchy account by a Chinese traveler and several rock inscriptions discovered near Bogor and in extreme western Java. These sources agree that the most powerful king of Tarumanegara was Purnavarman, who conquered neighbouring countries and built a canal to improve irrigation. The main product of the kingdom was indigo; its people practiced Buddhism. Chinese sources refer to the kingdom as To-lo-ma.
