Shewa, also spelled Showa, or Shoa,  historic kingdom of central Ethiopia. It lies mostly on high plateau country, rising to 13,123 feet (4,000 m) in Mount Ābuyē Mēda. Its modern capital and main commercial centre is Addis Ababa. Shewa is bounded on the northwest by the Blue Nile River and on the southwest by the Omo River; its eastern and southeastern boundaries are in the Great Rift Valley along the Awash River.
Shewa was the residence of regional kings from the mid-10th century to the end of the 14th century. In 1528 Shewa was overrun by Muslim invaders from the state of Adal to the east, and its ancient cities were destroyed. For over a century afterward, Shewa was penetrated by the Oromo people from the south, who moved into the political vacuum left in the region and established themselves in farming communities as far north as the Blue Nile valley. In 1856 Shewa was incorporated into the Ethiopian empire by the emperor Tewodros (Theodore) II, but Menilek II regained his kingdom of Shewa and in 1886 chose the site for Addis Ababa, his future capital. Building began at once, and, when Menilek became emperor of the whole country in 1889, Addis Ababa became the capital of Ethiopia.
