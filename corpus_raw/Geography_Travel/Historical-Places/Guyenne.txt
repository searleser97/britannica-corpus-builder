Guyenne, also spelled Guienne,  former region of southwestern France, merged with Gascony for the last centuries before the French Revolution in the gouvernement of Guyenne and Gascony (Guyenne-et-Gascogne). The Guyenne region corresponds to the modern département of Gironde and to most of the départements of Lot-et-Garonne, Dordogne, Lot, and Aveyron. The region was under English control during much of the later European Middle Ages.
From Roman times until the Middle Ages, the region of Guyenne was simply part of the region of Aquitaine (q.v.), of which the name Guyenne is a corruption. Historically, the name Guyenne first became important through the Treaty of Paris (1259) between Louis IX of France and Henry III of England. By this treaty, Louis IX accepted Henry III as his vassal for Guyenne and also for Gascony, which the English had held previously. (England had received both Aquitaine and Gascony in the 12th century through Henry II’s marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine.) Guyenne was retaken by the French at the beginning of the Hundred Years’ War, but the Treaty of Brétigny in 1360 restored it, with the whole of the old Aquitaine, to the English. In the later phases of the Hundred Years’ War, France reconquered all these areas. The last attempt by the English to retake the territory was repulsed at the Battle of Castillon (1453).
Louis XI gave the duchy of Guyenne to his brother Charles de France, duke de Berry, in 1469, but, after the latter’s death in 1472, it was reunited to the French crown. During the religious wars in the 16th century and during the Fronde in the 17th, Guyenne was the scene of bitter fighting.
