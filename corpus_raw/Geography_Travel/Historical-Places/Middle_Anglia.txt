Middle Anglia,  a province of Anglo-Saxon England, lying between East Anglia and Mercia and inhabited by a variety of peoples. It certainly comprised the basins of the Nene, Welland, and Great Ouse, with the districts west of the Fens, and probably extended into present Oxfordshire. Parts of the area were settled early, but nothing is known of its political history until 653, when it was subject to Mercia, under the rule of Penda’s son, Peada. St. Guthlac, who was born there, belonged to the Mercian royal family. Peada introduced Christianity, but no permanent see was created until 737, when one was established at Leicester. St. Wilfrid administered the province in his exile of 691–705.
The province contained the religious foundations of Peterborough, Ely, Oundle, and Crowland.
