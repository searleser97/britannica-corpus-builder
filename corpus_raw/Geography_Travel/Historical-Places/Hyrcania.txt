Hyrcania,  Old Persian Varkana,   (“Wolf’s Land”), ancient region located southeast of the Caspian Sea. Its capital was Zadracarta (Astrabad, modern Gorgān), and it formed part of the Median, Achaemenian, Seleucid, and Parthian empires, either as an independent province or joined with Parthia. In the list of Persian satrapies given by the Greek historian Herodotus, the Paricanians may have been the Hyrcanians.
Hyrcania was also the name of a town in Lydia, said by the Greek geographer Strabo to have derived its title from a colony of Hyrcanians settled there by the Persians.
