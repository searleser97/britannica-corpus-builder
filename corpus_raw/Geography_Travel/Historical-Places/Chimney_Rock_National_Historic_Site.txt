Chimney Rock National Historic Site,  spirelike sandstone rock formation in western Nebraska, U.S., that was a major landmark along the Oregon Trail. It is located about 3 miles (5 km) south of Bayard and consists of a 120-foot (37-metre) needle atop a cone-shaped mound; in all, the formation rises 475 feet (145 metres) above the south bank of the North Platte River. First used as a landmark by fur traders in the early 19th century, it was a significant milestone on the Oregon Trail; to early westbound travelers it meant they were near the end of the Great Plains and the beginning of the Rocky Mountains. The presence of a reliable water supply there made it a popular camping spot for the pioneers. The visitorsâ€™ centre has exhibits on westward migration. Chimney Rock was designated a national historic site in 1956.
