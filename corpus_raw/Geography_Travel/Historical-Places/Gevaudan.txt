Gévaudan,  ancient region of France, formerly located in the southern province of Languedoc and corresponding to most of the modern département of Lozère. A Roman community called Civitas Gabalitana, or Gabalitanus Pagus, it was occupied by the Visigoths in 472 and later became part of the Frankish kingdom. By the 9th century its master had become the powerful count-bishops of Mende. Louis IX (Saint Louis) inherited their rights in the 13th century, and in 1306 Gévaudan was absorbed into Languedoc.
Gévaudan gained notoriety in the 18th century as the roaming ground of a mysterious Beast of Gévaudan (Bête du Gévaudan), which inspired much popular literature and contemporary excitement. It appeared suddenly in 1765 and, in three years, allegedly attacked and devoured some 50 persons before it was killed by a peasant named Jean Chastel. The beast was doubtfully identified as a wolf or, later, as a lynx.
