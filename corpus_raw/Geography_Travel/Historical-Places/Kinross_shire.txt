Kinross-shire, also called Kinross,  historic county in central Scotland, which lies entirely within Perth and Kinross council area. It encompasses the basin of the lake known as Loch Leven and the surrounding rim of hills, including part of the Ochil Hills. Kinross-shire is the second smallest historic county in Scotland. It was long a poor farming region until the 19th century, when modern farming methods improved the productivity of its cropland. Kinross, the principal town, lies along Loch Leven. Mary, Queen of Scots, was imprisoned (1567–68) in Lochleven Castle, on an island in the lake. Another architectural landmark is Kinross House (1685–92), designed by Sir William Bruce and situated just east of Kinross on Loch Leven.
