George Washington Birthplace National Monument,  historical area consisting of 538 acres (218 hectares) of plantation land in Westmoreland county, eastern Virginia, U.S. It lies along the Potomac River 38 miles (61 km) east-southeast of Fredericksburg. The monument was established in 1930–32 through the efforts of the Wakefield National Memorial Association (organized in 1923 to recover the birthplace grounds), aided by industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
John Washington, great-grandfather of George, was the first family member to settle in the area, in about 1664. In 1731 Augustine, John’s grandson, married his second wife, Mary Ball, and settled at Popes Creek, where their son George was born February 22, 1732. “Wakefield,” the house where George spent the first three years of his life, was built (1722–26) by Augustine, but it was destroyed by fire (1779) after the family had moved to Mount Vernon in 1735.
The present Memorial House, reconstructed (1931–32) near a stone marker set by the Washington family in 1815, represents a typical 18th-century Virginia plantation dwelling with a period garden. The nearby Colonial Living Farm also depicts the environment of Washington’s infant years. Foundations of what is believed to be the birthplace house and other buildings have been unearthed.
