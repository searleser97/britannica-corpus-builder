Chu, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’u,  one of the most important of the small states contending for power in China between 770 and 223 bce.
Originally one of the duke states under the Xi (Western) Zhou dynasty (1046–771 bce), Chu rose in the mid-8th century bce around the present province of Hubei, in the fertile valley of the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) in South China. The Chu state has been characterized by some scholars as “barbarian” in origin, though some members of its ruling class possibly came from North China. Chu began to expand rapidly into north and east proper, conquering much of present-day Henan province. China itself was at the time divided into a series of small duke states, all of which theoretically owed allegiance to the Zhou dynasty, although the Zhou rulers had long since been unable to exercise control over more than their own fiefs. Chu was one of the first states to break with the established custom and give its rulers the title of wang, or “king,” thus removing any pretense of overall Zhou suzerainty.
Chu’s rapid expansion into North China was halted temporarily in the 7th century bce, when the small states of the region banded together to protect themselves from being absorbed. But Chu continued nevertheless to be a major contender for power in China for the next 400 years. In the 3rd century bce, Chu and six other major states finally absorbed all of the other little states and began a desperate struggle for supreme control of China. Chu itself was finally eliminated in 223, and the state of Qin united all of China two years later.
When the Qin dynasty fell after ruling for less than 15 years, the rebels, led by a former aristocrat, Xiang Yu, installed a former member of the Chu ruling house as the new emperor of China. But this new Chu government survived only for a few months before Xiang Yu was defeated by one of his former generals, Liu Bang, who then established the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce).
