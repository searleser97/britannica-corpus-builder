Komoé National Park, French Parc National de la Komoé, Komoé also spelled Comoé,  national park, northeastern Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast). Originally founded in 1953 as the Bouna-Komoé game reserve, in 1968 it was expanded and established as a national park. Comprising approximately 4,440 square miles (11,500 square km) of wooded savanna, Komoé contains the country’s largest concentration of wildlife, including antelopes, hippopotamuses, lions, monkeys, and other animals. The Lobi people inhabit sections of Komoé, engaging in millet and sorghum farming and some hunting. In 1983 it was recognized as a Biosphere Reserve and designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. The park’s longstanding problems of poaching, uncontrolled fires, and overgrazing were further exacerbated by the civil unrest in Côte d’Ivoire in the early 21st century.
