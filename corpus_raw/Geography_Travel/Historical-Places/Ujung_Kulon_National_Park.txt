Ujung Kulon National Park, English Point Kulon National Park,  national park on the island of Java, in the province of Banten, Indonesia. It is best known as the last refuge of the one-horned Javan rhinoceros. A remote area of low hills and plateaus, with small lagoons and coastal dunes, it occupies 475 square miles (1,229 square km) on a peninsula and some islands at the extreme western tip of Java. The park faces the Sunda Strait, separating Java from Sumatra, and includes Panaitan Island, about 6 miles (10 km) northwest of the peninsula.
The Krakatau Islands, a small group of islands that are remnants of the famous volcanic eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, are located about 40 miles (65 km) north of the peninsula. Following Krakatoaâ€™s explosions and tidal waves, the peninsula was blanketed by a layer of volcanic ash and dust. After the jungle grew back and the area was reinhabited by wildlife, it was set aside as a nature reserve in 1921; the national park was proposed in 1980 and formally established in 1992. The area was designated a World Heritage site in 1991. The park today contains the last remaining low-relief forest on Java; typical trees are of the genera Ficus and Barringtonia.
Fewer than 60 Javan, or lesser one-horned, rhinoceroses (Rhinoceros sondaicus) remain alive, although the animals once thrived throughout the islands of Java, Borneo, and Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and other areas of Southeast Asia. Poaching and disease are the gravest threats to the remaining Javan rhinoceroses. Additional species in the park include bantengs (a type of wild cattle), Javan gibbons, langurs (leaf monkeys), muntjacs (barking deer), chevrotains (mouse deer), crocodiles, green turtles, green peacocks, and jungle fowl. In the late 20th century Javan tigers, which had inhabited the area, were considered to be extinct.
