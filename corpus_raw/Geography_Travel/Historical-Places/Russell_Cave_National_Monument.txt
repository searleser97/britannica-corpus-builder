Russell Cave National Monument,  portion of a limestone cavern in northeastern Alabama, U.S., 6 miles (10 km) northwest of Bridgeport and just south of the Alabama-Tennessee border. The cave and site area (0.5 square mile [1.3 square km]) were given to the National Park Service by the National Geographic Society in 1958, and the national monument was created in 1961. The cave is named for Thomas Russell, a veteran of the American Revolution who once owned the land above it.
The cave is about 210 feet (64 metres) long, 107 feet (33 metres) wide, and 26 feet (8 metres) high. It is one chamber of a more extensive cave system, of which some 7 miles (11 km) of passages have been mapped. It contains an almost continuous record of human habitation dating to at least 7000 bc, including artifacts from the Archaic, Woodland, and Mississippian cultures. The first archaeological excavation of the cave was in 1953; other digs were conducted in 1956–58 and 1962. A selection of the artifacts recovered are displayed at the monument’s visitor centre. Spelunkers are permitted to explore about 2.5 miles (4 km) of mapped passages beyond the monument area.
