Franklin,  unofficial state (1785–90) of the United States of America, comprising the eastern portion of what is now Tennessee and extending to “unclaimed” lands to the west.
The short-lived state was established mainly as a result of North Carolina’s cession of its western lands to the United States. Settlers in the isolated mountain wilderness, deserted and largely ignored, formed an association that would make and administer laws. They also required an active militia because they were open to Indian attack. When North Carolina acted to rid itself of the unwanted burden of protecting these remote settlements, the settlers elected delegates who met to discuss the establishment of a new state. Patterning their state constitution on that of North Carolina, the Franklanders (as they called themselves) elected officers who would act under the leadership of John Sevier. Personal rivalries and other factors led to the dissolution of the Franklin union, and, when the federal government in 1790 brought into being the Southwest Territory, it effectively reorganized the area, and the Franklin administration ended.
