Kaḍiri,   Hinduized kingdom in eastern Java, established about the 11th century. Little is known of the kingdom. According to the Pararaton (“Book of Kings”), a mighty king of eastern Java, Airlangga, divided his kingdom between his two sons before he died in 1049: the western part was called Kaḍiri, or Panjalu, with Daha as its capital, while the eastern part was called Janggala. Jayabhaya of Kaḍiri (reigned 1135–57) successfully annexed Janggala. Jayabhaya and succeeding kings of Kaḍiri expanded their territories to non-Javanese areas, including coastal areas of Borneo and the island of Bali. Kaḍiri could not control Sumatra, however, because the Śrivijaya empire, though by now in decline, was still predominant in the region. The last king of Kaḍiri was Kertajaya, who reduced the power of the Brahmans and hence came into conflict with them. A rebel, Ken Angrok, later the king of Singhasāri, made a secret agreement with the Brahmans and in 1222 defeated Kertajaya at Ganter. In the place of Kaḍiri, the kingdom of Singhasāri was established. See also Kediri.
