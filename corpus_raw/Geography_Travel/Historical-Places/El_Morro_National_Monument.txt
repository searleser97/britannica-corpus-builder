El Morro National Monument,  rock formation and archaeological site in west-central New Mexico, U.S., 12 miles (19 km) southeast of Ramah. The monument was established in 1906 and has an area of 2 square miles (5 square km).
El Morro (the “Headlands,” or “Bluff”), or Inscription Rock, is a soft sandstone mesa (cuesta) rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the valley floor. A water catchment basin and sheltered coves at its foot made it an important camping place on the trail to the fabled cities of Cíbola. Indians, Spaniards, and Americans left hundreds of inscriptions (1605–1906) on the cliff sides of the mesa. The best-known of these inscriptions was left by the Spanish conquistador Juan de Oñate when he passed through the region in 1605. El Morro also has a number of pre-Columbian petroglyphs, and on its top lie ruins of two Ancestral Pueblo (Anasazi) pueblos.
