Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet,   in South Africa, administrative districts of the Cape of Good Hope under the rule of the Dutch East India Company. Established in 1743 and 1786, respectively, they became centres of a frontier independence movement in the 1790s. With the continuous expansion of colonial cattle farmers, the eastern frontier of Swellendam moved progressively from the Great Brak River in 1743, to the Gamtoos (1770), and finally to the Great Fish and Bushmans rivers in 1778. Graaff-Reinet, carved out of the turbulent black-white frontier zone of Swellendam and Stellenbosch, was bounded by the Baviaans and Tarka rivers in the northeast and the Great Fish in the southeast. In 1795 the discontentment of the white inhabitants with the policies of the remote central government at Cape Town erupted in the declaration of short-lived independent republics in Swellendam and Graaff-Reinet. They were reincorporated into the Cape Colony after its conquest by the British late that year.
