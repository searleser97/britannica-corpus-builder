Beni Hasan, also spelled Banī Ḥasan,  Egyptian archaeological site from the Middle Kingdom (1938–c. 1630 bce), lying on the eastern bank of the Nile roughly 155 miles (245 km) south of Cairo. The site is noted for its rock-cut tombs of 11th- and 12th-dynasty officials of the 16th Upper Egyptian (Oryx) nome, or province. Some of the 39 tombs are painted with scenes of daily life and important biographical texts. The governors of the nome, whose capital was Menat Khufu, administered the eastern desert. The tomb of one, Khnumhotep II, contains a scene showing Semitic Bedouin merchants in richly coloured garments entering Egypt. Speos Artemidos, a rock-cut shrine  originally dedicated to the local lion-headed goddess Pakhet, built by Queen Hatshepsut and Thutmose III of the 18th dynasty, lies one mile south in an ancient quarry, with a smaller shrine of Alexander II nearby.
