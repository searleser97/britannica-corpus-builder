Dombes,   historic region of east-southeastern France, once a sovereign municipality and now included in the d√©partement of Ain. From 1032, when the Kingdom of Arles, of which Dombes was part, passed to the Holy Roman emperor Conrad II, effective authority in the region was exercised by local lords. After 1378 it was under the nominal authority of the kings of France but was actually ruled as an independent principality by the Bourbon family. Francis I of France seized it from the Bourbons in 1523, and, although Dombes was later restored to the House of Bourbon-Montpensier (1561), it ultimately returned to the French crown in 1762.
