Ciskei, also called Xhosa-Ciskei or Xosa-Ciskei,  former republic (though never internationally recognized as such) and Bantustan that was inhabited principally by Xhosa-speaking people in Southern Africa. It bordered the Indian Ocean on the southeast and was bounded by the Republic of South Africa on the southwest, northwest, and northeast. A fingerlike extension of South African territory on the northeast separated Ciskei from Transkei (another former Xhosa homeland that was declared independent by South Africa). Ciskei, which means “this side of the Kei,” reflected the republic’s location south of the Great Kei River, as compared with Transkei (“across the Kei”) north of the river. The Great Fish River bounded Ciskei to the southwest.
Repeated incursions by Xhosa peoples from the area into territory settled by European farmers began in the late 18th century. An ensuing series of wars, the Cape Frontier Wars, resulted in the complete incorporation of the Ciskei region into the Cape Colony by the end of the 19th century. Ciskei became an administratively distinct territory within South Africa in 1961 and acquired a legislative assembly and an executive council 10 years later. In 1972 Ciskei was declared a self-governing Bantustan, with its capital at Zwelitsha, and in 1981 it was declared an independent republic under an act passed by the South African Parliament. The new republic functioned as an official homeland for millions of Xhosa-speaking Africans in South Africa who were denied citizenship in that country under the laws of the apartheid system.
Under the South African constitution that abolished the apartheid system, Ciskei was reincorporated into South Africa as part of newly created Eastern Cape province in 1994.
