Murcia,   independent Muslim (Moorish) kingdom centred on the city of Murcia (Arabic: Mursīyah), Spain. It came into being on two occasions: first in the 11th century, following the disintegration of the Spanish Umayyad caliphate; and again in the 12th century, as part of the Spanish Muslim reaction against the rule of the North African Almoravids. The kingdom’s first ruler, ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Ṭāhir, declared himself independent in 1063, though to preserve the fiction of the unity of the Umayyad caliphate he took the title not of king (malik) but of minister (ḥājib).
For a time Murcia played an intermediary role between the Almoravids and the Castilians, but in the end religious sympathies inclined it to the Almoravids. Then the Almoravid caliph Yūsuf ibn Tāshufīn, who had brought the quarreling states of Muslim Spain under his control, took possession of Murcia in 1092, incorporating it into his empire. General discontent under the Almoravids led to a rising under Abu Jaʿfar ibn Hud in 1144 and the reestablishment of Murcian independence. The kingdom was then united with Valencia.
After 1168 Murcia came under the rule of the North African Almohads. In spite of this, it retained an autonomous administrative system that was conserved by the Christian Castilians when they took possession of the territory, almost without a struggle, in 1243.
