Kakongo,  former African kingdom that was located on the Atlantic coast, north of the mouth of the Congo River (present-day Angola, in the Cabinda exclave), between the kingdoms of Ngoyo and Loango. According to Loango tradition, Kakongo was the source of its founding dynasty.
Kakongo was part of the kingdom of Kongo’s domain in the early 16th century, though it was not under Kongo’s direct authority. Kakongo’s principal port, Malemba, became a major centre for the export slave trade in the early 1700s—especially for English, Dutch, and French merchants—and port facilities were expanded from that time to handle increasing numbers of ships. Powerful local families who held titles such as “governor of the harbour” and “minister of trade and Europeans” allied themselves with foreign merchants and further increased their status in Kakongo; their burgeoning influence eventually diminished the power of the Kakongo king in the early 1800s.
The Portuguese had an interest in the vicinity of Kakongo and occupied the coast in 1883 to forestall French action in the area. They also made agreements with local authorities, such as António Thiaba da Costa, the holder of a Kakongo title who was simultaneously made an officer in the Portuguese army. These actions helped support Portugal’s authority in the region, and their long-standing claim to Cabinda (of which Kakongo was then a part) was internationally recognized in 1885, resulting in the region’s incorporation into Angola.
