Neustria,  during the Merovingian period (6th–8th century) of early medieval Europe, the western Frankish kingdom, as distinct from Austrasia, the eastern kingdom. By derivation, Neustria was the “new” (French neuf; German neu) land—i.e., the area colonized by the Franks since their settlement in northern Gaul. It corresponded roughly to the area of present France west of the Meuse and north of the Loire rivers. In the 7th century Austrasia and Neustria were rivals, but the victory of Pippin II of Herstal, mayor of the palace in Austrasia, over the Neustrians at Tertry (687) assured the ultimate ascendancy of Austrasia. In the later Merovingian period, Neustrian writers used the names Neustria and Francia (France) interchangeably, implying that Neustria formed the heart and core of the Frankish lands. Later, the name Neustria came to denote a much smaller area, and, by the 11th and 12th centuries, it was sometimes used synonymously with Normandy.
