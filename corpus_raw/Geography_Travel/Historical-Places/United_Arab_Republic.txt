United Arab Republic (U.A.R.), Arabic Al-Jumhūriyyah al-ʿArabiyyah al-Muttaḥidah,  political union of Egypt and Syria proclaimed on February 1, 1958, and ratified in nationwide plebiscites later that month. It ended on September 28, 1961, when Syria, following a military coup, declared itself independent of Egypt.
Years of political turmoil in Syria, topped with increased interest in its affairs from the Cold War powers, pushed the country’s Pan-Arabist Baʿth Party to seek political union with Egyptian Pres. Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser, unprepared to tackle Syria’s domestic issues, was initially reluctant toward union but was eventually persuaded. His conditions for union, however, included measures that would bring Syria in line with the administrative structure of Egypt. While this enabled a more full integration, it effectively marginalized Syrian voices in the new regime even as Nasser implemented unpopular economic policies in Syria. Disaffected and ignored, members of the government from Syria’s Baʿth Party resigned their posts in December 1959.
The situation failed to improve thereafter and Syrians remained dissatisfied with the union. After a set of decrees in July 1961 exacerbated the agitation by limiting landholdings and nationalizing financial institutions and private enterprises, Syrian units of the military staged a coup on September 28 and seceded without contest. Despite the dissolution of the union with Syria, Egypt retained the name United Arab Republic until September 2, 1971, after Nasser’s death.
From March 1958 until December 1961, the United Arab Republic maintained a confederation with the Zaydi imam Aḥmad ibn Yaḥyā who ruled in northern Yemen. The confederation was known as the United Arab States. Overtures were made to Iraq to join the union after its July 1958 revolution, but the effort was opposed by its prime minister, ʿAbd al-Karīm Qāsim.
