Valois,   historic region of France that gave its name to the second line of the Capetian dynasty; it corresponds to the southeastern quarter of the modern département of Oise, with an adjacent portion of Aisne. Under the Merovingian kings (c. 500–751) and their successors, the first Carolingians, the county of Valois, or pagus Vadensis, with its capital at Vez, was an administrative district; in the post-Carolingian period it became a hereditary countship. Dynastically united with the Vexin (borderland between Île-de-France and Normandy) in the early Capetian period, it passed, with Crépy as capital, in 1077 to the House of Vermandois. In 1214 Philip II Augustus of France annexed Valois to the royal domain. Philip of Valois became king of France in 1328; his descendants ruled until 1589. Under them, Valois was a duchy held by members of the royal family. Louis XIII, a Bourbon king, gave Valois to his brother Gaston, duc d’Orléans, in 1630. Louis XIV gave it in turn to his brother Philippe, likewise duc d’Orléans, in 1661. The latter’s descendants held it until the Revolution. In 1790 it was erased in the redivision of France into départements.
