Jaintia,  in Indian history, a state in Assam, northeastern India, stretching from what is now the northern frontier between Bangladesh and India over the Jaintia Hills to the Kalong River in the Assam plain. The people were of Khasi origin.
In 1824, when Myanmar (Burma) invaded Assam, the raja allied with the British, who annexed his territory in 1832. Bengali traders and European tea planters moved in, producing tension that led to a rebellion in 1862. This was suppressed in a campaign that led to criticism of the severity of British authorities in India.
