Griqualand East,  historical region of South Africa that now lies within interior southwestern KwaZulu/Natal province and adjacent areas of Eastern province. In 1861 Adam Kok III, the chief of the Griqua people (a group of mixed white and Khoekhoe ancestry), led his people from what had become the Orange Free State to Griqualand East after many had been forced to sell their lands to white trekkers. The British hoped the Griquas would be a buffer there between African peoples and white settlers. The influence of European law increased in the area until 1879, when Griqualand East was formally annexed to the Cape Colony and Griquas were once again forced to sell their land to white settlers. Many of the demoralized Griqua eventually resettled north of Cape Town.
In 1903 the district of Griqualand East was established as a black African council and was admitted into the Transkeian territories, which, although they contained many European farms in certain areas, were chiefly a black reserve. The eastern portion of the former Griqualand East (around Umzimkulu) and the larger western portion (around the towns of Mount Fletcher, Qumbu, Mount Frere, and Mount Ayliff) became part of Transkei in 1976 and part of Eastern province in 1994. The central portion (around Kokstad, Cedarville, and Franklin) remained an exclave of what was then Cape Province until 1978, when it was transferred to Natal (later KwaZulu/Natal). Dairy farming and cheese processing are economically important.
