Furka Pass,  mountain pass between Uri and Valais cantons of south-central Switzerland. It lies at 7,976 feet (2,431 metres), just south of the Dammastock peak (11,909 feet [3,630 metres]). It is crossed by road (built 1864–66) and railway (1910–27), which connect Andermatt (northeast) with Gletsch (southwest). The road, constructed mainly for military reasons, is now noted for its scenic views of the Rhône Glacier and of the Bernese and Pennine Alps. The railway, which passes through the mile-long Furka Tunnel, is part of a larger railroad system connecting eastern and western Switzerland.
