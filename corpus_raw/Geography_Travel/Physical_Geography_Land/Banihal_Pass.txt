Banihal Pass,  pass in the Pir Panjal Range in the Indian-held sector of Jammu and Kashmir union territory in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. Banihal—a name that in Kashmiri means “blizzard”—lies at an elevation of 9,290 feet (2,832 metres) in the Doda district. It forms the main gateway to the Vale of Kashmir from the Indian plains. The Jammu–Srinagar road enters the pass through the Jawahar Tunnel, which is occasionally blocked by snow in winter. Goods formerly crossed the pass on the backs of porters, who made the journey in a day.
