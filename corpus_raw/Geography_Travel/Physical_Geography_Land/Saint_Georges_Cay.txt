Saint Georgeâ€™s Cay,   islet in the Caribbean Sea, 9 miles (14 km) northeast of Belize City, Belize, of which it is considered a part. Offshore, in 1798, the British defeated a Spanish armada of 2,500 men and 31 vessels to end Spanish claims to British Honduras (Belize). During the 19th century, the islet served briefly as the administrative capital. Its main population centre is Spanish Wells village. Tomatoes, coconuts, pineapple, and fish support a subsistence economy. From February to May and during August, there is a thriving beach-resort business.
