Vostok Island, Vostok also spelled Vostock, formerly Staver Island,  coral atoll in the Southern Line Islands, part of Kiribati, southwestern Pacific Ocean. It lies 400 miles (640 km) northwest of Tahiti. A low formation rising to 16 feet (5 metres) above sea level and with a land area of only 0.1 square mile (0.3 square km), it has no anchorage in its lagoon. Vostok was sighted in 1820 by the Russian Antarctic explorer Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and was named for his ship. It was claimed in 1860 by the United States under the Guano Act of 1856 and by Great Britain in 1873, but its guano deposits were probably never exploited. An attempt to establish a copra plantation on the atoll in 1922 failed. With the other Southern Line Islands, Vostok became a part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony in 1972 and a part of independent Kiribati in 1979. The island has the least-disturbed indigenous flora of all the Line Islands and was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1979. There are no inhabitants.
