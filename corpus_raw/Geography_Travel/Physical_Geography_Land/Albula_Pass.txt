Albula Pass,  mountain pass in the Albula Alps of eastern Switzerland that forms the principal route from northeast Graub√ºnden (Swiss canton), southeastward to the Engadin (valley of the Upper Inn River). The Albula River rises nearby, just north of Saint Moritz, and flows northwestward for 22 miles (35 km) to the Hinterrhein River. The pass (the highest point of which reaches an elevation of 7,585 feet [2,312 metres]) has been used since the 13th century, and a carriage road was built across it in 1865. The opening of the railway tunnel (4 miles [6.5 km] long) beneath the pass in 1903 greatly increased its importance. The tunnel connects the resorts of Preda (northwest) and Bevers (southeast); and cars can board the trains and avoid the pass, which is generally closed by snow between November and June.
