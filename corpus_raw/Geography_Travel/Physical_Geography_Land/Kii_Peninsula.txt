Kii Peninsula, Japanese Kii-hantō,  peninsula of southern Honshu, Japan, facing the Pacific Ocean (east and south) and the Kii Strait and the Inland Sea (west). The peninsula is composed of the Kii Range, whose mountains end abruptly on the north in a fault scarp that commands the valleys of the Kushida River and the Kino River. In general, the mountains are of strong relief, being broken by deep valleys, sharp ridges, and steep declivities. High elevation is maintained until the coast is approached. At the coast the steep descent of the mountains is continuous to the sea bottom, where there is no continental shelf. The range is regarded as the deepest block of mountains in Japan. The flat-topped ridge of Mount Ōdaigahara rises in the east to 5,561 feet (1,695 m), while the Ōmine Mountains, crowned by Mount Hakken (6,283 feet [1,915 m]), rises in the centre of the peninsula. The western ridge is lower, attaining 4,403 feet (1,342 m) in Mount Obako.
The Kii Peninsula is located directly in the path of typhoons and weather fronts that bring the baiu (“rainy season”) and is therefore one of the wettest areas of Japan. Banyan trees, hemp palms, and other subtropical plants are mixed with temperate laurel forests. The mountainous interior is a rich source of Japanese cedar.
Many important centres of Buddhism and Shintō—including Kōyasan, Yoshino, and Kumano—are located on the peninsula. Ise, the site of the foremost Shintō shrine of Japan, is near its eastern tip. The Kii Peninsula is included within the ken (prefectures) of Wakayama, Nara, and Mie.
