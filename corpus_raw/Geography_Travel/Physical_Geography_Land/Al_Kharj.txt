Al-Kharj,  oasis, east-central Saudi Arabia. It lies southeast of Riyadh, the national capital, with which it is associated administratively. Situated around a series of deepwater pools, near which numerous ancient tombs have been found, Al-Kharj was chosen as the site of a government experimental farm in 1938. Since then it has grown into a flourishing agricultural oasis, producing cereals, dates, vegetables, and fruits. Other economic activities include livestock and poultry raising and horse breeding. Its traditional dairy industry was greatly expanded in 1981 by the inauguration of a meat and dairy combine that, at its opening, was the largest in the Middle East. Al-Kharj is linked to Riyadh and the Persian Gulf by a railroad.
