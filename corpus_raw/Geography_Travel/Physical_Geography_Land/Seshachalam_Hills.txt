Seshachalam Hills,  hill ranges of the Eastern Ghats, southern Andhra Pradesh state, southeastern India. Formed during Precambrian time (i.e., earlier than about 540 million years ago), the ranges contain sandstone and shale interbedded with limestone and are highly dissected, with many longitudinal valleys. They are bounded by the Rayalaseema uplands in the west and northwest and the Nandyal Valley (formed by the Kunderu River) in the northeast. The Seshachalam Hills extend over some 3,000 square miles (8,000 square km), and their general trend is east-southeast. The Seshachalam Hills, together with the Erramala Range to the north, vary in elevation from 1,300 to 4,500 feet (400 to 1,370 metres). The hillslopes have only a thin forest cover because of scanty rainfall. Tributaries of the Penneru River drain the region. The ruggedness of the topography, the infertility of the soils, and the semiarid climate restrict agriculture. Jowar (grain sorghum) and peanuts (groundnuts) are the major crops. Asbestos, barite, and limestone are worked; hand-loom weaving, bamboo working, and brick making are the only other economically significant activities. Pulivendla is the only important town.
