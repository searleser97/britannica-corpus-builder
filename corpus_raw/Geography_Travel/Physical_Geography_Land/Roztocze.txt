Roztocze,  range of hills in east-central Poland. The Roztocze rises from the Lublin Uplands and extends southeastward across the border into Ukraine. Low and rolling, the range is approximately 100 miles (160 km) in length, and its highest peaks are Rogaty Goraj (1,280 feet [390 metres]) and Wapielnia (1,263 feet [385 metres]). The range provides a number of scenic views and is composed of forested terrain indented with deep gorges and streams overflowing slabs of limestone. A few small towns are located in the region. In 1974 a national park was founded there.
