Corregidor Island,  rocky island, strategically located at the entrance of Manila Bay, just south of Bataan province, Luzon, Philippines. It is a national shrine commemorating the battle fought there by U.S. and Filipino forces against overwhelming numbers of Japanese during World War II.
The small (2-square-mile [5-square-km]) island, part of the province of Cavite, has long been considered a natural fortress. The Spanish fortified it in the 18th century, when it was used as a registration (corregidor) site for ships entering the bay. After the Spanish-American War, the island became a U.S. military station, and an elaborate system of tunnels and emplacements was constructed. When Japan invaded the Philippines (December 1941), Gen. Douglas MacArthur chose Bataan and Corregidor Island as his major defense positions. Bataan fell on April 9, 1942, and Corregidor Island became the last outpost of organized resistance in the islands. Lieut. Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright and his forces repelled the invaders for 27 days, until May 6, 1942, when they were forced to surrender Corregidor Island to Lieut. Gen. Homma Masaharu. U.S. forces regained the island in 1945.
On Corregidor Island are the Pacific War Memorial, numerous gunneries, and the Malinta Tunnel, which served as a supply depot, hospital, and MacArthurâ€™s headquarters. Since the mid-1950s, the island has been the site of a military training camp in counterguerrilla tactics.
