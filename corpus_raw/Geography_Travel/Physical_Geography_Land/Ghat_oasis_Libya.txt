Gh훮t, also spelled Gat,  oasis, southwestern Libya, near the Algerian border. Located on an ancient Saharan caravan route, it was a slave-trading centre and the object of European exploration in the 19th century. Gh훮t lies west of the Wadi Tanezzuft in hilly sandstone country, near the Jib훮l Mountains and the Tadr훮rt plateau. A nearby offshoot of the mountains, Idinen, is a legendary fortress of ghosts. The town is walled and compact, with white houses, narrow alleyways, and covered arcades. It is inhabited by Tuareg peoples. Water, supplied by springs, is strictly controlled by customary law. Palm groves and gardens yielding cereals and vegetables lie outside the walls; livestock are grazed along the nearby wadis; and artisan industries produce rugs, baskets, and leather goods. Pop. (2003 est.) 22,800.
