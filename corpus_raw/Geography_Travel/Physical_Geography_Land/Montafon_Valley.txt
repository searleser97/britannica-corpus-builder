Montafon Valley, German Montafontal,  upper valley of the Ill River, western Austria, extending about 15 miles (25 km) southeast from Bludenz between the Rhätikon Mountains and the Fervall Gruppe (mountains). Settled since Celtic times (4th century bc), its inhabitants were generally isolated until the coming of the Walsers (emigrants from the Swiss canton of Wallis [Valais] in the Upper Rhône River valley) in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Walsers were responsible for the name Montafon, probably meaning either “mountain beyond” or “mountain gorge.” Traditionally an area of cattle breeding and dairy farming, the valley has, since World War II, become the focus of Vorarlberg’s hydroelectric-power production (at Parthenen and Rodund) and a popular resort area.
