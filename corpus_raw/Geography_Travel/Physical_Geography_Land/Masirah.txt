Maṣīrah, also spelled Masira,  island of Oman, in the Arabian Sea, off the country’s southeastern coast. The island is separated from the mainland by the narrow Turʿat (channel) Maṣīrah. There is an airfield, occupied by the British until the late 1970s, at the northern tip. The Gulf of Masira lies between the island (north) and the Raʾs (cape) al-Madrakah (south). Maṣīrah is the habitat of large colonies of turtles. There are several very small towns on the island’s coast.
