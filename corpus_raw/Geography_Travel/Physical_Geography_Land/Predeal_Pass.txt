Predeal Pass, Romanian Pasul Predeal,  pass, southeastern Romania, connecting the city of Braşov and the Bîrsei Depression to the north with the city of Ploieşti and the Danube Plain to the south, across the Transylvanian Alps (Southern Carpathians). A major natural route followed by road and rail lines, it divides the Bucegi Massif, the eastern limit of the Southern Carpathians, from the Eastern Carpathians, which terminate there in the Baiu Mountains. Southward from the Predeal Pass the transportation lines follow the Prahova River valley, which holds a string of eight settlements. West of Predeal Pass is Bran Pass (Pasul Bran), a route from Braşov to Cîmpulung between the Bucegi Massif and the Făgăraş Mountains.
