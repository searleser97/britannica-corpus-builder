Shelf break,  submerged offshore edge of a shallow continental shelf, where the seafloor transitions to continental slope. A shelf break is characterized by markedly increased slope gradients toward the deep ocean bottom. The shelf break may be as shallow as 20 metres (65 feet) and as deep as 550 metres; the worldwide average depth is 133 metres.
