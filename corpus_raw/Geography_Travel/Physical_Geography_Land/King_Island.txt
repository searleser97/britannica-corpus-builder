King Island,  island in Bass Strait, 50 miles (80 km) off the northwestern coast of Tasmania, Australia. The rougly oval-shaped island is about 40 miles (64 km) long and 15 miles (24 km) wide at its widest point. It has a gently rolling surface that rises to a hill known as Gentle Annie (531 feet [162 metres]) in the southeast.
The island was sighted in 1798 by a Captain Reed and was claimed for Great Britain in 1802 to prevent the French from taking possession. It was named in 1801 for Philip Gidley King, third governor of New South Wales. Scarcely settled before 1900, it now makes up a local government area. Mixed livestock farming (dairy and beef cattle) and crop growing are pursued on a broad central and narrower northern belt. Scheelite (tungsten ore), mined sporadically at Grassy since 1917, is typically sent to the chief town and harbour of Currie on the west coast. There are also mineral sand deposits. Area 424 square miles (1,098 square km). Pop. (2001) local government area, 1,689; (2011) local government area, 1,566.
