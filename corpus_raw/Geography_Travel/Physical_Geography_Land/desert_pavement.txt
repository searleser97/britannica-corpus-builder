Desert pavement,  surface of angular, interlocking fragments of pebbles, gravel, or boulders in arid areas. Desert pavement forms on level or gently sloping desert flats, fans, or bajadas and lake and river terraces dating to the Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago).
The percolation of infrequent precipitation tends to cause lateral and downslope movement of silt particles beneath the surface of the ground. This leads to the concentration of gravel, a process enhanced by the constant removal of fine sediment at the surface by wind action. Gravel concentrations in desert areas are sometimes called lag gravels, in reference to the residue left by the removal of fine material. Thus, pavements are produced by the combined effects of water and wind. Evaporation and capillarity draw soil moisture to the surface and may precipitate calcium carbonate, gypsum, and other salts that cement the pebbles together to form a desert conglomerate. The pebbles often are so packed and smooth that no more wind deflation can occur; in the Sahara such areas are generally followed by caravan routes. A similar area is the hammada, in which wind has removed most of the material, leaving only bare rock surfaces scattered with large rocks.
