Østerdalen,  narrow valley, Hedmark fylke (county), southeastern Norway. It extends in a general north-south direction from the eastern flanks of the Dovre Mountains and is approximately 75 miles (120 km) long. The Glomma (Glåma), Norway’s longest river, flows through the valley. Lumbering, agriculture (grains and hay), and livestock raising are principal economic activities. Rena, at the junction of the Rena and Glomma rivers near the valley’s southern end, has paper and cardboard mills, powered by hydroelectricity from dams on the Glomma. Other places of importance in the valley are Tynset and Alvdal, which are herredskommuner (rural municipalities), and Koppang. Fine fishing in the Glomma attracts many tourists.
