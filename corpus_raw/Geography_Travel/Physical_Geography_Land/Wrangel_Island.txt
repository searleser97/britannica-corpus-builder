Wrangel Island, Russian Ostrov Vrangelya,  island, in Chukotka autonomous okrug (district), far northeastern Russia, lying in the Arctic Ocean and separating the East Siberian Sea from the Chukchi Sea. The long, narrow island is about 78 miles (125 km) wide and occupies an area of some 2,800 square miles (7,300 square km). It is separated from the Siberian mainland by Long Strait. Wrangel Island is part of the region of Arctic tundra, much of it low-lying lichen. Although the highest part of the island reaches 3,596 feet (1,096 m) at Sovetskaya Mountain, discovered in 1938, there are no glaciers. Geologically, Wrangel Island consists of crystalline slates, granites, and gneisses together with alluvial sands. There are many small lakes, and the northern and southwestern coasts are characterized by numerous sandspits enclosing lagoons. The seas around the island are rarely free from pack ice. The climate is Arctic, with a mean July temperature of 36 °F (2.4 °C). In summer there is a large bird population, as well as lemmings, Arctic fox, and polar bears.
Russian writings claim Russian knowledge of the island from the early 18th century. The Russian explorer Ferdinand P. Wrangel, for whom the island was later named, determined its location from accounts of Siberian natives but did not land there during his mapping of the Siberian coast in the early 1820s. Russian fur traders subsequently visited the island, it was sighted by U.S. vessels in 1867 and 1879, and U.S. crews landed on the island in 1881. Survivors of a sunken Canadian ship reached Wrangel in 1914, and the leader of the expedition, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, created an international incident in the early 1920s when he claimed Wrangel for Canada without authorization. The Soviet Union then annexed the island, and permanent occupation began with the landing of Chukchi and Russian families in 1926. Wrangel Island State Reserve, established in 1976, occupies 2,700 square miles (7,000 square km) and contains polar bears, walruses, and reindeer. The reserve was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004.
