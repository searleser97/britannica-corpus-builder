Mitiaro,  island in the southern Cook Islands, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. It is a raised coral atoll about 4 miles (6 km) wide and is encircled by a reef.
The island’s interior, made up of fertile volcanic soil, is ringed by swamps and limestone. It also has underground limestone caves and pools that supply fresh water.

The volcanic soil of the interior supports the growing of kumara (sweet potatoes), coconuts, bananas, and citrus fruits. The leaves of the aromatic maire bush are harvested, made into garlands, and exported via Rarotonga to Hawaii and New Zealand for use in making leis. The island has an airstrip located on the northern coast. Area (land only) 8.6 square miles (22.3 square km). Pop. (2006) 193; (2011) 189.
