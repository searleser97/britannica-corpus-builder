Langkawi Island, Malaysian Pulau Langkawi,  main island of the Langkawi group, in the Strait of Malacca, Peninsular (West) Malaysia. It lies just south of the Thai island of Tarutao. Langkawi, 18 miles (29 km) long and 10 miles (16 km) wide, rises to 2,887 feet (880 metres) at Raya Mountain.
Though most of its inhabitants are engaged in fishing, the island is also intensively cultivated (coconuts and rubber). Kauh, the main village on the southern shore, is linked by road to the coastal settlements of Air Hangat and Padang Masirat. Langkawi Island has ferry connections with Kuala Kedah on the mainland and is frequented for its beaches, waterfalls, hot springs, coloured cliffs, historic caves, and fishing grounds. Its steep-sided limestone hills are favoured by climbers.
