Roosevelt Island,   island of Antarctica, in the northeastern part of the Ross Ice Shelf, Ross Dependency (New Zealand), south of the Bay of Whales, off the coast of Edward VII Land. The ice-covered island, 90 miles (145 km) long and 35 miles (56 km) wide, was discovered in 1934 by American explorer Richard Evelyn Byrd. Its mean absolute elevation exceeds 1,640 feet (500 m), and its ice varies from 1,300 to 2,950 feet (400 to 900 m) thick. Pioneering studies of ice-sheet seismology, made on Byrd’s second Antarctic expedition (1933–35), showed that a large northwestern section of the shelf (Roosevelt Island) is actually grounded, i.e., not afloat.
