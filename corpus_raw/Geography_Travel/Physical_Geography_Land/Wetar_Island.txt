Wetar Island, Indonesian Pulau Wetar,  island in the Banda Sea, Maluku provinsi (“province”), Indonesia. It lies 35 miles (56 km) north of and across the Wetar Strait from the northeastern coast of Timor. Wetar Island is 80 miles (130 km) long east-west and 28 miles (45 km) wide north-south; it is spread over an area of 1,400 square miles (3,600 square km). The island is surrounded by coral reefs and deep seas. In its interior, wild, rugged mountains covered with tropical rain forests rise to 4,632 feet (1,412 m). The climate is hot and moist, with heavy rainfall. The island is sparsely populated, and the principal occupation is subsistence agriculture, producing mainly sago. Deep-sea fishing is also important, and tortoiseshells are exported to those countries where their importation is still permitted. The population is mostly Papuan, and the dominant religion is Islām; some islanders are Christians. Roads connect the towns of Masapun and Ilwaki on the southern coast, Arwala on the eastern coast, and Lioppa, Laliki, and Wesiri on the northern coast.
