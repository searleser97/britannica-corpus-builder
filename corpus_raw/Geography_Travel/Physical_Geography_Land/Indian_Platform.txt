Indian Platform,  Precambrian continental shield, one of four around which the Asian continent coalesced. Five areas of geosynclinal folding constitute the platform basement; from oldest to youngest, these are the Dharwar, Aravalli (see Aravalli Range), Eastern Ghat (see Ghats), Satpura (see Satpura Range), and Delhi foldings. After the consolidation of the basement in Proterozoic times (between 2.5 billion and 542 million years ago), the evolution of the platform comprises six major tectonic-stratigraphic sequencesâ€”that which produced the rocks of the Cuddapah Group and those of the Vindhyan (see Vindhya Range), Gondwana, Mesozoic, Paleogene, and Neogene sequences.
