Andros Island,  largest island of The Bahamas, West Indies. It lies 25 miles (40 km) west of New Providence Island and about 125 miles (200 km) east-southeast of the U.S. state of Florida.
A flat, heavily forested island, Andros extends about 100 miles (160 km) from north to south and spans about 45 miles (70 km) from east to west at its widest point. Although the island has a distinct outline, it is highly fragmented, with many bays, inlets, lakes, cays, and channels, and is technically an archipelago. Just off the east coast is one of the largest barrier reefs in the world. Andros has only a small population and only moderate tourism, and the people tend to live in scattered settlements, the chief towns being Nicholls Town, Andros Town, and Kemps Bay, all on the east coast. Fruit and vegetable agriculture and fishing are the islandâ€™s economic mainstays, supplemented by a growing tourist industry and some packinghouses. A batik industry exists at Andros Town. Area 2,300 square miles (5,957 square km). Pop. (2000) 7,686; (2010) 7,490.
