Goodenough Island, formerly Morata,  one of the Dâ€™Entrecasteaux Islands of Papua New Guinea, in the Solomon Sea, southwestern Pacific Ocean. It lies about 20 miles (32 km) across Ward Hunt Strait from the eastern tip of the island of New Guinea and northwest of Fergusson Island across Moresby Strait. The forested volcanic island, measuring about 20 by 15 miles (32 by 24 km), rises to 8,419 feet (2,566 metres) in its central mountain range. This range is bordered by a cultivated plain producing copra, yams, and kapok. The main settlement is at Bolubolu, on the east coast. The island was visited in 1873 by Capt. John Moresby, who named it after Commodore James Graham Goodenough. During World War II it was occupied by Japanese troops for several months in 1942 and then captured by Allied forces, who built an airstrip at Vivigani (open to commercial service since 1963). Goodenough was once the site of important alluvial gold mining.
