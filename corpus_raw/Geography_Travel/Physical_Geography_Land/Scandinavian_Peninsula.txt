Scandinavian Peninsula,  large promontory of northern Europe, occupied by Norway and Sweden. It is about 1,150 mi (1,850 km) long and extends southward from the Barents Sea of the Arctic Ocean between the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea (east), Kattegat and Skagerrak (south), and the Norwegian and North seas (west). The peninsula (area 289,500 sq mi [750,000 sq km]) essentially consists of a mountainous mass, much of which is part of the ancient Baltic Shield, parts of which were affected by glaciation during the Pleistocene Epoch (i.e., about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago). Norway and Sweden share the western and eastern sides, respectively, of this mountain mass. Sweden, however, has extensive slopes of gentle gradient down to the Baltic Sea, while Norwayâ€™s mountains reach to the actual coastline and are deeply dissected by fjords.
