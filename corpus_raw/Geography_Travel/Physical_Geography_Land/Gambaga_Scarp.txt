Gambaga Scarp,   line of cliffs along the Volta River basin, northeastern Ghana, western Africa. The scarp forms the elevated northern boundary of the Volta River basin and the eastern section of the granite plateaus of Wa and Mamprusi. To the south is another narrow plateau, followed by a gradual descent to the surrounding land. The Gambaga’s steep erosional scarps reveal a composition of nearly horizontal sandstones. Because of the elevation (1,000–1,500 feet [300–460 m]), the climate is relatively cool and moist, allowing cultivation of grains and yams and stock raising. The only sizable town on the plateau is Gambaga, originally a cotton-collecting centre and now a popular hill station. The only major road off the scarp runs from Gambaga to Walewale and from there to Kumasi.
