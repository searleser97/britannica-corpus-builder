Donner Pass,  pass, in the Sierra Nevada of northern California, U.S., that is the most important transmontane route (rail and highway) connecting San Francisco with Reno, Nev. Rising to an elevation of more than 7,000 feet (2,100 metres), it lies 35 miles (55 km) west-southwest of Reno. During the winter of 1846â€“47, George and Jacob Donner lost nearly half of a party of more than 80 immigrants when they tried to cross the pass en route to the Sacramento Valley. The party was blocked by snow in the Sierra Nevada, and, when their food ran out, some reportedly survived by eating the corpses of their fallen companions. (After examining remains from the campsite, researchers in 2010 announced that they had been unable to find any human bones or other physical evidence of cannibalism.) The pass now lies within Tahoe National Forest, and Donner Memorial State Park is nearby.
