It is bounded to the northwest by the Canal de los Indios and on the north and northeast by the Gulf of Batabanó, which separate it from the mainland of western Cuba. A 1904 treaty recognizing Cuba’s sovereignty over the island was finally ratified by the United States in 1925. The capital of the special municipality is Nueva Gerona.

The National Reformatory, a prison, is located a few miles from the island’s main town, Nueva Gerona. The section south of Lanier Swamp is small, rocky, and isolated, inhabited only by a few fishermen and charcoal makers. Kaolin and marble are extracted on the island.
