Vieques Island, Spanish Isla de Vieques,  island and municipio (municipality), Puerto Rico. It lies 13 miles (21 km) east of the main island, fronting to the south on the Caribbean Sea and north on Vieques Sound, which connects the Caribbean with the Atlantic Ocean. Composed mostly of volcanic and granite intrusives, the generally hilly island is 21 miles (34 km) long and 3 miles (5 km) wide, and it is 52 square miles (135 square km) in area. Isabel Segunda, the chief town, is located on the northern coast. Esperanza, a fishing village, is on the south coast. Fishing, tourism, and light manufacturing are economically important.
In the early 1940s more than two-thirds of the island was annexed by the U.S. Navy, which established a large munitions depot and a bombing range. Many local residents and other Puerto Ricans subsequently protested against the navy’s use of the land, notably during 1999–2000, when camps were set up to disrupt the use of the bombing range. In a nonbinding referendum in 2001, more than two-thirds of Vieques residents favoured the immediate cessation of bombing exercises. All U.S naval training activities on Vieques ended in 2003. However, the disposal of ordnance, which included detonating bombs, was expected to take a number of years, and it continued into the 2020s. Much of the navy’s land was used to create Vieques National Wildlife Refuge. In 2017 Vieques and the surrounding area were devastated by Hurricane Maria, and it took several years for the island to recover. Pop. (2010) 9,301; (2019 est.) 8,386.
