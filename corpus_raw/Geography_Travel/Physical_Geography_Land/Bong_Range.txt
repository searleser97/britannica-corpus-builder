Bong Range,   mountain chain, west central Liberia, West Africa, extending for about 25 miles (40 km) in a northeast–southwest direction at elevations averaging from 600 to 1,000 feet (180–300 m). Its highest point, however, is 2,116 feet. The range is the source of the Farmington River. Since the mid-1960s its iron-ore deposits have been worked by the German-Liberian Mining Corporation (Delimco) and shipped via the company railroad to the Port of Monrovia (50 miles southwest).
