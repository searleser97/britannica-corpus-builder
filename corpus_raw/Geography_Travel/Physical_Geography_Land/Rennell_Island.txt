Rennell Island, also called Mu Nggava,  southernmost of the Solomon Islands, in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, 130 miles (209 km) south of Guadalcanal. The island and the smaller Bellona Island, just to the northwest, constitute Rennell and Bellona province.
An atoll 50 miles (80 km) long and 8 miles (13 km) wide, it comprises raised coral limestone (400 to 500 feet [120 to 150 metres] above sea level) and some low-grade phosphate rock. The brackish Te Nggano, in the southern part of the island, is the largest lake in the insular Pacific. Rennell was annexed by Great Britain in 1899. Its Polynesian inhabitants cultivate yams and taro. Bauxite deposits have been found on the island and offer its best prospect for development. The island is the worldâ€™s largest raised coral atoll, and the relatively undisturbed eastern part of the island, including the lake, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1998. Area province, 259 square miles (671 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) province, 2,800.
