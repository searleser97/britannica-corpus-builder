Cape São Roque, Portuguese Cabo de São Roque,  headland on the northeastern Atlantic coast of Brazil, Rio Grande do Norte state, 20 miles (32 km) north of Natal, the state capital. It is frequently called the easternmost point of the South American continent (at 5°29′ S 35°13′ W), but the true eastern extremity is at Cape Branco (Cabo Branco), to the south-southeast (at 7°9′ S 34°47′ W).
