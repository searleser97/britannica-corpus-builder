Hunter Island,  island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, within the French overseas country of New Caledonia, although Franceâ€™s claim to the island is disputed by Vanuatu. It is located about 350 miles (560 km) east of the New Caledonian mainland. Volcanic and offering little appeal for human habitation, it has a diameter of less than 1 mile (1.6 km) and is situated on Hunter Island Ridge, a submarine shelf rising from the ocean floor. Its volcano, which is intermittently active, reached an elevation of about 1,000 feet (300 metres) in the late 1950s. Discovered (1798) by an Englishman, Capt. John Fearn of the ship Hunter, the island is sometimes referred to as Fearn Island. There are no permanent inhabitants.
