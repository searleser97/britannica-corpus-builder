Malaspina Glacier,  segment of the St. Elias Mountains glacier system, west of Yakutat Bay in southeastern Alaska, U.S. The most extensive individual ice field in Alaska, it flows for 50 miles (80 km) along the southern base of Mount St. Elias, is more than 1,000 feet (300 metres) thick, and covers about 1,500 square miles (3,900 square km). It is located in Wrangellâ€“St. Elias National Park and Preserve, which with Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (Alaska, U.S.), Kluane National Park and Reserve (Yukon, Canada), and Tatshenshini-Alsek National Park (British Columbia, Canada) constitutes a World Heritage site. Named for Captain Alessandro Malaspina, who explored the Alaskan coast in 1791, it is an excellent example of the rare piedmont glacier (i.e., a large lobe of ice spread out over level terrain and associated with the terminus of a large mountain-valley glacier); the Malaspina is the largest such glacier in the world.
