Eucla Basin,  artesian depression in Western Australia and South Australia, Australia. Sloping southward to the Great Australian Bight and underlying the enormous limestone waste of the Nullarbor Plain, its area is about 69,500 square miles (180,000 square km). Composed of two main aquifers, the upper layer of the basin is a sequence of Neogene and Paleogene limestones (those about 2.6 to 65 million years old) and the deeper layer is composed of sandstone of Cretaceous age (from about 65 to 145 million years old). Surface water percolating down through the limestone of the basin has created subterranean caves and tunnels. Small amounts of groundwater can be tapped through bores. The name Eucla is derived from the Aboriginal words yer, meaning “bright,” and coloya, meaning “fire.”
