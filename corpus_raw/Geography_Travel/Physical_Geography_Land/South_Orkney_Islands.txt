South Orkney Islands,  island group lying between the Scotia Sea to the north and the Weddell Sea to the south in the Southern Ocean. It is composed of two large islands (Coronation and Laurie) and a number of smaller islands and rocky islets and forms part of the British Antarctic Territory. The islands (total area about 240 square miles [620 square km]) are barren and uninhabited, but Signy Island is used as a base for Antarctic exploration. George Powell (British) and Nathaniel Palmer (American), both sealers, sighted and charted the islands in December 1821.
