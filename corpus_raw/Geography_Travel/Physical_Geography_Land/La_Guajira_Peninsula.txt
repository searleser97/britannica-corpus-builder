La Guajira Peninsula, Spanish Península de La Guajira, Guajira also spelled Goajira,  peninsula on the northwestern coast of South America. It is bounded by the Caribbean Sea to the north and west, the Gulf of Venezuela to the southeast, and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and Sierra de Perijá to the south. Much of the peninsula lies in northeastern Colombia; the rest is in northwestern Venezuela, where it is known as La Goajira Peninsula.
The climate of the peninsula is generally hot and arid or semiarid. Goat raising by the Wayuu people is widespread, and there is some pearl fishing as well as saltworks on the coast. Divi-divi (Caesalpinia coriaria, a small shrub whose pods are used for tanning and dyeing) is an important product of the area, and there are some mineral deposits. Ríohacha, Colombia, is the principal town on the peninsula and the focus of a limited highway network. Natural gas fields near Ríohacha are connected by pipeline with Barranquilla, Colombia, to the southwest.
