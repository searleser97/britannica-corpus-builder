Ferro, Spanish El Hierro,  island, Santa Cruz de Tenerife provincia (province), in the Canary Islands comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Spain, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is the westernmost and smallest of the Canary Islands. Ferro, the most westerly place known to ancient European geographers, was chosen about 150 ce by the Classical geographer Ptolemy for the prime meridian of longitude, and until the 18th century some navigators continued to reckon from this line.
The island is mountainous (reaching 5,000 feet [1,500 metres]) and is ringed by sheer cliffs except near Valverde, the capital, where wooded slopes meet the sea. Ferro lacks a harbour, and landings are made at a short mole at La Estaca, which serves as the island’s port. Mineral springs attract a small tourist trade, but the economy primarily depends on subsistence agriculture and tropical farming (e.g., bananas and pineapple). There is an airport on the island. Area 104 square miles (269 square km).
