Cape Diamond, French Cap Diamant,  promontory in Qu√©bec region, southern Quebec province, Canada. It is part of the city of Quebec and is located west of the confluence of the St. Charles and St. Lawrence rivers. It is the highest point in the headland (333 feet [102 m]) and is crowned by the Citadel, a former military fortress. Toward the St. Lawrence it presents a bold and precipitous front; on the landward side and toward the St. Charles the declivity is more gradual. The cape was named in 1608 by the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, who found quartz crystals resembling diamonds there. Considerable damage and loss of life was suffered in the Lower Town by rock falls from its heights in 1841, 1852, and 1889.
