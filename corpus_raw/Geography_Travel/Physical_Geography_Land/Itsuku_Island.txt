Itsuku Island, also called Miya Island, English Shrine Island,  offshore island, Hiroshima ken (prefecture), Japan, in the Inland Sea. The small island, one of Japan’s most scenic locations, is 19 miles (31 km) in circumference and occupies an area of 12 square miles (31 square km). It is best known for its 6th-century shrine, which was built on tidal land and has the appearance of floating on the sea during high tide. It was named for one of the daughters of Susanowo, the Shintō storm god. Other of its religious buildings include the 9th-century temple that crowns Mount Mi, which rises to the island’s highest elevation, 1,739 feet (530 metres).
Because of its religious significance, births and burials were long prohibited on Itsuku Island. This ban was lifted after the Meiji Restoration (1868), but the dead are still transported to Ōno, on Honshu, for burial. The town of Miyajima on the island is a popular summer resort, with beaches, cherry trees, and tame deer.
