Spit,   in geology, narrow coastal land formation that is tied to the coast at one end. Spits frequently form where the coast abruptly changes direction and often occur across the mouths of estuaries; they may develop from each headland at harbour mouths. Spits, which may be composed of sand or shingle, are formed by the longshore movement of sediment. They often are complexly curved, with a characteristic recurved head (hook); this probably results from the refraction of waves around the spitâ€™s end.
