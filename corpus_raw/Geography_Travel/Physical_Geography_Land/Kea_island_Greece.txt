Kéa, also spelled Kéos, also called Tziá,  westernmost of the Cyclades (Modern Greek: Kykládes) group of Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. It constitutes a dímos (municipality) in the South Aegean (Nótio Aigaío) periféreia (region). Kéa lies about 13 miles (21 km) east of the southern tip of Attica
 (Attikí). With an area of 50.4 square miles (130.6 square km), it rises gradually toward the centre, to the peak of Profítis Ilías (1,841 feet [561 metres]). The principal town, Kéa, on the site of ancient Ioulis, is located near the northwestern coast. Kéa’s proximity to Athens (Athína) has made it a popular vacation spot for Athenians.
Inhabited since early Helladic times, Kéa fought on the Greek side in the naval battles of Artemisium and Salamis (both 480 bce) during the Greco-Persian Wars, and it subsequently joined the Delian League and the Athenian alliance. The island revolted in 363–362 but was reduced by Athens, which established a monopoly over Kéa’s ruddle (red-earth dye), its principal product. Called Tziá in the Middle Ages, the island was divided in 1207 ce among four Italian adventurers. In 1537 it formed a part of the duchy of Náxos, and in 1566 it came under Turkish rule, under which it continued until it joined the kingdom of Greece in 1912. The island’s agricultural products include grapes, citrus, and honey, and a factory manufactures aluminum kitchenware for the Greek mainland. Some valonia oak is also exported. At ancient Karthaia are the remains of a Doric temple and other buildings. Pop. (2001) municipality, 2,162; (2011) municipality, 2,455.
