Dungeness,   promontory on the south coast of the administrative and historic county of Kent, southeastern England. It is a bleak triangle of shingle (gravel) projecting southeastward into the English Channel where it narrows to the north into the Strait of Dover. Romney Marsh lies to its north and the River Tillingham below Rye to its south. A modern lighthouse, a lifeboat station, a signaling station, and a bird sanctuary are situated on the promontory.
Two nuclear power stations were built at Dungeness Point in the second half of the 20th century. The first, Dungeness A, which had two reactors, was completed in the mid-1960s and generated electric power until it was decommissioned in 2006. The second, Dungeness B, also consisting of two reactors, began producing power in the mid-1980s.
