Karelian Isthmus, Russian Karelsky Peresheyek, Finnish Karjalan Kannas,  neck of land lying between Lake Ladoga (east; in Saint Petersburg oblast [province]) and the Gulf of Finland (west; part of the Baltic Sea). The isthmus shows evidence of ancient glaciation; its long, winding morainic hills, which reach an elevation of about 570 feet (175 m) in the south, are separated by countless lake-filled hollows and swamps, and its soil, sand, and rocks reveal glacial deposition. Much of the region is covered by evergreen forests.
Claimed by Russia to have been part of Rus from the 9th century, the isthmus was captured by Sweden at the beginning of the 17th century. It was ceded to Russia in 1721 with the Treaty of Nystad, but it was further negotiated as part of independent Finland in 1918. In about 1929, Finland began to construct the fortifications of the so-called Mannerheim Line across the isthmus. The purpose of this demarcation was to guard against the threat posed by the Soviet Union, which sought a section of the isthmus in order to protect Leningrad (Saint Petersburg). After refusing to negotiate, the Finnish government was forced by the Soviet victory in the four-month Russo-Finnish War (1939â€“40) to give up the isthmus and other territories.
Remains of 13th- and 14th-century fortifications, as well as the Swedish fortress at Vyborg, are attractions, and a number of cities on the shores of the isthmus are popular resort areas. The isthmus was the headquarters of V.I. Lenin for several periods between 1906 and 1917, and the artist I.Y. Repin lived in Kuokkala (now Repino) from 1902 to 1930.
