Tidore Island, also spelled Tidor, Indonesian Pulau Tidore,  one of the Moluccas (Maluku) islands, east-central Indonesia. With an area of 45 square miles (116 square km), Tidore lies off the western coast of central Halmahera and forms part of Maluku Utara provinsi (North Moluccas province). The southern part is occupied almost entirely by an extinct volcanic peak (5,676 feet [1,730 metres]); the north is hilly, with some level strips along the coast. The Muslim inhabitants sell fish, cultivate garden produce, and are proficient at metalworking. Like nearby Ternate, Tidore was the seat of an ancient and powerful sultanate. The Portuguese arrived in 1521, destroyed the capital, and built (1578) a fort. The Spanish maintained a foothold well into the 17th century, aiding the Tidorese against the sultan of Ternate and the Dutch. The latter conquered the island in 1654 but recognized the sultanâ€™s nominal power.
