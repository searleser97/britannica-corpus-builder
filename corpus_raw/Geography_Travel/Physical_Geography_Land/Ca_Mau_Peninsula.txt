Ca Mau Peninsula,  peninsula, the southernmost projection of Vietnam, lying between the South China Sea on the east and the Gulf of Thailand on the west, with drainage to each. The flat, triangular peninsula, with lengths ranging from 110 to 130 miles (180 to 210 km), averages about 7 feet (2 m) above sea level and owes its configuration largely to shore deposits of the Mekong River, which are also responsible for the sweeping spit of Cape Bai Bung at the peninsula’s tip. The Ca Mau has a tropical monsoonal climate with year-round rainfall except for a short, drier winter season of two to three months. The peninsula’s northern limit may be considered to be the westward-flowing Cai Lon River; in the east the Ca Mau Peninsula merges into the Mekong delta region.
An area without vehicular roads until after World War II, the remote peninsula sweeps southward from a canalized plain to a dense, tropical mangrove swamp on whose winding streams the Vietnamese fish. The villagers export and trade in rice, honey, wax, fibre mats, and charcoal made from hardwoods, all of which are staples of the economy of the town of Ca Mau (Quan Long). For many years after World War II much of the Ca Mau Peninsula was successively held by Viet Minh and Viet Cong guerrillas.
