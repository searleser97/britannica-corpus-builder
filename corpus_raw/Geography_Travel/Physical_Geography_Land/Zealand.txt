Zealand, Danish Sjælland,  largest and most populous island of Denmark, lying between the Kattegat and the Baltic Sea, separated from Sweden by The Sound (Øresund) and from Funen (Fyn) island by the Great Belt.
Zealand’s basal rock platform is exposed in the chalk and limestone cliffs at Stevns Klint—which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2014—but is generally obscured by thick morainic deposits forming a gently undulating landscape. Its irregular coastline is broken by Ise Fjord and Roskilde Fjord. The northern part of the island is well-wooded and lake-strewn, with fine resort beaches on the coast. This area was once a royal hunting ground, and many fine castles survive. Fertile clay loams support agriculture (grains), dairy farming, and cattle breeding, especially in the south. Fishing and tourism are also economically important. There are many Stone Age and Viking relics, particularly the Viking fortress of Trælleborg (c. 1000 ce), as well as medieval churches, castles, and manor houses. Besides Copenhagen and its suburbs, urban settlements include Roskilde, Helsingør (Elsinore), Næstved, Korsør, Slagelse, Sorø, Holbæk, Ringsted, Vordingborg, Køge, Kalundborg, and Hillerød. In the late 1990s Zealand became connected to Funen by the Great Belt Fixed Link, a bridge and tunnel system, and in 2000 the Øresund Link opened, connecting Copenhagen and Malmö, Sweden. Area 2,715 square miles (7,031 square km). Pop. (2016 est.) 827,499.
