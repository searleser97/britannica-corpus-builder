Mai-chi-shan, Pinyin Maijishan,  one of three major sites in northern China’s Kansu sheng (province) where rock-cut Buddhist caves and sculpture are found. The more than 190 sculptures now visible are carved in nearly 1,000 caves and recesses on the cliff faces that are more than 400 feet (120 m) high.
A Liang-dynasty document demonstrates that monasteries probably existed at the site as early as the 5th century ad and that some of the sculptures found there may be dated at least that early. The Buddhist images continued to be made through the T’ang and Sung periods (to the early 12th century), and restorations were made to some figures during the Sung and also Ming (1368–1644) dynasties.
The historical importance of the Kansu cave sculptures, which constitute the earliest body of Buddhist sculpture in China, is their close resemblance to styles found in Central Asia and in India. Mai-chi-shan seems to contain the culminating examples of molded-clay sculpture in this early tradition. They are noted for a freedom in the treatment of drapery and other features and a certain elongation and relaxation of attitude in the figures.
