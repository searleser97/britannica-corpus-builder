Elcho Island, also called Galiwinku or Galiwinâ€™ku,  island, Northern Territory, Australia, in the Arafura Sea. It is situated 2 miles (3 km) across Cadell Strait from the Napier Peninsula and is a part of Arnhem Land, a large region belonging to the Yolngu Aboriginal people. The low-lying island is 30 miles (48 km) long by 7 miles (11 km) wide and is separated from the Wessel Islands (east) by Brown Strait.
The region was inhabited by Australian Aboriginal people from prehistoric times. Dutch explorers, including Abel Janszoon Tasman, visited and charted the coast and its islands in the early to mid-17th century. The town of Galiwinku, on the southwestern coast, is the largest settlement and only town on the island, and its population is primarily Aboriginal. Galiwinku is also the name of the island in the local Yolngu Aboriginal language. A series of Methodist missions were established in the 20th century; one established in 1947 remained active until the 1970s. Galiwinku was administered for many years by an Aboriginal town council, but in 2008 the entire region was absorbed into East Arnhem shire (now East Arnhem region), which assumed responsibility for local government. Economic activities during the mission period included fishing, fruit and vegetable cultivation, and various small industries such as a brickworks, although most of those enterprises have since closed. Some crops are grown, and the waters off the island are used for commercial fishing. Pop. (2006) Galiwinku urban centre, 1,698; (2011) Galiwinku urban centre, 2,124.
