Mactan Island,  coral island, central Philippines, located in the Bohol Strait off the eastern shore of the island of Cebu. Rectangular in shape, the low-lying island has extensive mangrove swamps. It protects the harbour of Cebu City.
On April 7, 1521, Ferdinand Magellan, the Portuguese navigator, landed on the island; he was killed there by Chief Lapulapu on April 27. The spot in the northeast where he fell is marked with a monument, and Lapulapu, regarded as the first Filipino to defeat a Western conqueror, is considered a national hero.
Coconut production and fishing are the islandersâ€™ primary activities. Mactan Island has an international airport, which serves Cebu City. A 2,822-foot (860-metre) bridge (completed in 1973) connects Mactan and Cebu islands. The city of Lapu-Lapu (formerly Opon) faces Cebu City and has major port facilities, including petroleum piers.
