Rikers Island,   island in the East River near the entrance of Bowery Bay, north of La Guardia Airport, New York, N.Y., U.S. Politically part of the borough of the Bronx (north), Rikers Island is joined to the borough of Queens by a bridge (inaccessible to the public). The island was owned from 1664 by Abraham Rycken (later Riker), for whom it was named. When New York City annexed the land in 1884, it consisted of about 87 acres (35 hectares). Now increased to a size of more than 400 acres (162 hectares), Rikers Island has been since 1935 the site of a city penitentiary that was relocated from Welfare (now Roosevelt) Island. The first of the facilities to be constructed on Rikers was the Menâ€™s House of Detention. Other facilities include the Correctional Institution for Men, the Correctional Institution for Women, the Anna Kross Center, the Adolescent Detention Center, and the Rikers Island Hospital.
