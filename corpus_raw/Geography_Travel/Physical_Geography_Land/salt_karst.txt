Salt karst,   solution phenomena occurring in rock salt by the action of groundwater. Although rock salt is considerably more soluble in water than is the calcite that forms karst topography, rock salt is impervious, and solution can take place only on the exterior surfaces. The brine formed by initial solution must be drained off by groundwater before more solution can occur. Salt karst sinkholes, caverns, and crevices may be formed depending on the thickness of the salt body. Shallow features may be formed on playa surfaces with thick salt crusts by the percolation of water down to the water table.
