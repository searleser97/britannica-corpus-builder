Gozo, Latin Gaulus, Maltese Ghawdex,  second largest of the Maltese islands (after the island of Malta), in the Mediterranean Sea, 3.25 mi (5.25 km) northwest of the nearest point of Malta. It is 9 mi long and 4.5 mi wide and has an area of 26 sq mi (67 sq km). It is also known as the “Island of the Three Hills,” but in fact, the island has numerous conical knolls, which resemble extinct volcanoes. Gozo is not only hillier but also greener than the island of Malta. Its principal town, Victoria, also called Rabat, stands near the middle of the island on one of a cluster of steep hills in an intensively cultivated area. The megalithic temple Ggantija, to the east of Victoria, is noteworthy. Considered to be more fertile than Malta, Gozo depends heavily on agriculture, producing fruit, vegetables, grapes, and dairy products. Fishing is also important, and there is a cottage lace industry, but tourism is fast becoming the most important economic activity. The island is linked with Malta by ferry and helicopter service. Gozo is held to be the island of Ogy’gia, in Greek legend, where the sea nymph Calypso entertained Odysseus. Pop. (2007 est.) 31,289.
