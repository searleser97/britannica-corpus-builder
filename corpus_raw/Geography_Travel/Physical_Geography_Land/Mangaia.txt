Mangaia,  southernmost of the southern group of the Cook Islands, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. It is the second largest of the Cook Islands, after Rarotonga, and at an estimated 18 million years old is believed to be the oldest island in the Pacific.
A raised coral atoll, it has a volcanic interior, rising to Rangimotia (554 feet [169 metres]), which is encircled first by a swampy region and then by coral limestone cliffs 200–300 feet (60–90 metres) high. Its inland wetlands are fed by underground streams, and the island contains a network of subterranean caves. Mangaia was inhabited by Polynesian people at the time of its discovery (1777) by the English navigator Capt. James Cook. Mangaia has some manganese ore deposits and areas of fertile red soils on which pineapples, taro, citrus fruits, copra, tomatoes, and coffee are grown. A significant economic activity is the harvesting and processing of pupu, small yellow snails, for use in necklaces and as hat decorations. The leaves of the aromatic maire bush are harvested, made into garlands, and exported via Rarotonga to Hawaii and New Zealand for use in making leis. Export shipping is hampered by an outlying barrier reef and the lack of a lagoon harbour. Area (land only) 20 square miles (51.8 square km). Pop. (2006) 631; (2011) 562.
