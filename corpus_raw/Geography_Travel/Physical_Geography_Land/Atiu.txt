Atiu,  one of the southern Cook Islands, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. It is the third largest of the Cook Islands and is also known as Enuamanu (“land of birds”).
Atiu was settled by Polynesian voyagers about 500 ce and was explored by crew members from the ship of Capt. James Cook in 1777. A raised coral atoll, Atiu has a circumference of roughly 20 miles (30 km). A high central plateau rises to about 230 feet (70 metres) and is surrounded by low swamps, beaches, and a 66-foot- (20-metre-) high coral reef (makatea), which contains many underground caves. Fertile volcanic soil and freshwater springs in the valleys allow cultivation of citrus fruits, taro, bananas, papayas, and copra, which are exported. Coffee is also grown. Shipping is hampered by the lack of an adequate lagoon behind the fringing reef. The island has an airstrip on the northeast coast. Settlement is exclusively in the interior. Area (land only) 10.4 square miles (26.9 square km). Pop. (2006) 558; (2011) 468.
