Hydra, Modern Greek Ídhra,  dímos (municipality) and island of the Saronic group in the Aegean Sea, Attika (Modern Greek: Attikí) periféreia (region), central Greece. It lies just off the eastern tip of the Argolís peninsula of the Peloponnese and has a maximum length, northeast-southwest, of 13 miles (21 km). The highest point, Mount Ere, is 1,936 feet (590 metres). Once quite wooded and well watered, as its Turkish name, Çamlıza (“Place of Pines”), shows, it is now denuded and dry, with almost no arable land. Water is collected from rain in cisterns and is also shipped from the mainland.
First prominent in the late 15th century under Turkish rule, it became a seafaring centre. In the 17th century the island received an influx of Albanian refugees from the Peloponnese; maritime trade then thrived. After an abortive insurrection against the Turks in 1770, Hydra received Greek refugees, who also concentrated their energies on commercial shipping. In 1821, at the outbreak of the War of Greek Independence, the island’s population had risen to 30,000. With neighbouring Spétsai and Psará islands, the Greeks and Albanians of Hydra placed their considerable merchant fleets and fortunes at the disposal of the insurgents, and Hydriote sea captains commanded Greek ships in several successful encounters with the Turkish fleet.
With the advent of steamships, however, the maritime activities of the island declined. Industries now include sponge fishing, cotton weaving, shipbuilding, and international tourism. Ídhra, the chief town, on the north coast, is an artists’ and writers’ colony and the residence of a metropolitan bishop. Its narrow, rock-cut streets surround a sheltered harbour. Three other small ports on the north coast are Mandrákion, Mólos, and Panayía. Area 19.2 square miles (49.6 square km). Pop. (2001) municipality, 2,646; (2011) municipality, 1,966.
