Princess Royal Island,  island in British Columbia, Canada, that lies about a mile off the mainland in Hecate Strait (northern Pacific), which separates it from Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands). One of many offshore islands, it is about 52 miles (84 km) long and 7–26 miles (11–42 km) wide and has an area of 876 square miles (2,269 square km). Its west coast is deeply indented by fjords, one of which (Surf Inlet) has been dammed to provide hydroelectric power. The terrain rises to 5,500 feet (1,676 metres) in the northeast near Butedale, a steamer landing and the only community. The island was named in 1788 by Capt. Charles Duncan after his sloop Princess Royal.
