Gomera, La,  island, Santa Cruz de Tenerife provincia (province), in the Canary Islands comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Spain, in the North Atlantic Ocean. The island is circular in shape. Its coasts, especially on the west, are rugged and precipitous, and its interior is mountainous. The flattish dome of Garajonay Peak (4,879 feet [1,487 metres]) in the centre of the island is the highest point. The lower areas are semiarid, but, because of the plentiful supply of fresh water from springs, the valley floors are irrigated, and bananas and date palms are grown. In the south grapes, figs, cereals, and tomatoes are cultivated. Traditionally, the economy depended mainly on agriculture and fishing, augmented by some boatbuilding, but now services are the dominant economic sector, with tourism growing in importance following the opening of an airport on La Gomera in 1999. The only roads are short and follow the lines of the larger valleys.
San Sebastián de la Gomera, on the east coast, is the chief port and capital. It has a sheltered roadstead and is backed by the steep cliffs of a wide ravine. It was the last stopping place of Christopher Columbus on his first transatlantic voyage, in 1492, and the house where he stayed and the church he attended are tourist attractions. La Gomera is famous for the whistling language (a skill acquired from the extinct Guanches people) used by natives of the island to communicate from hilltop to hilltop. Area 146 square miles (378 square km).
