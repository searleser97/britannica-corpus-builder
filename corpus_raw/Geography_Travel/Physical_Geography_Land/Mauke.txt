Mauke, also called Parry Island,  easternmost of the southern Cook Islands, a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand in the South Pacific Ocean. Known for its rich soil, Mauke is called the “garden” of the Cook Islands.
It is a raised coral atoll of low formation (100 feet [30 metres] high) and oval in shape, and it has a volcanic centre encircled by coral limestone. Its fertile red soils support both subsistence agriculture and cash cropping. Bananas, mangos, coconuts, and other fruits and vegetables are grown, and cattle and other livestock are raised. The island is covered with high-quality hardwoods, palms, and pandanus pine. The leaves of the maire bush are harvested and exported to Hawaii for use in making leis. Shipping is impeded by the lack of an adequate lagoon behind the outlying coral reef, but the island has an airstrip. Area (land only) 7.1 square miles (18.4 square km). Pop. (2006) 372; (2011) 300.
