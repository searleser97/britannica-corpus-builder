Kiritimati Atoll, also called Christmas Atoll,  coral island in the Northern Line Islands, part of Kiribati, in the west-central Pacific Ocean. It is the largest island of purely coral formation in the world, having a circumference of about 100 miles (160 km).
Kiritimati Atoll was sighted on Christmas Eve in 1777 by the English navigator Captain James Cook. (Kiritimati is the Gilbertese spelling of Christmas.) Although claimed by the United States under the Guano Act of 1856, the atoll was incorporated into the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony by Great Britain  in 1919. Kiritimati played a role during World War II for Allied forces, who used it as an important refueling station for military aircraft en route from Hawaii to the South Pacific. Its ownership remained in dispute until 1979, when Kiritimati became a part of independent Kiribati.
The atoll has port facilities and a large government-owned copra plantation. A small international airport is located near London, the main settlement, on the northwest coast of the island. Kiritimati was an operations base for nuclear weapons tests by the British in 1957â€“58 and by the United States in 1962. Its position near the Equator made its surrounding waters a favoured site for sea launches of Earth satellites beginning in the late 1990s. Kiritimati was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1975. Area 150 square miles (388 square km). Pop. (2010) 5,586.
