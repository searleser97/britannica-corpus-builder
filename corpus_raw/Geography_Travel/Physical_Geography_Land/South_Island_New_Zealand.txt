South Island, Maori Te Waipounamu,  island, the larger and southernmost of the two principal islands of New Zealand, in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. South Island is separated from North Island to the north by Cook Strait and from Stewart Island to the south by Foveaux Strait.
Mountainous terrain occupies almost three-quarters of South Island, with a central mountain chain, the Southern Alps, trending southwest to northeast and culminating at Mount Cook (12,316 feet [3,754 metres]). The Southern Alps separate the narrow coastal strip of the Westland Plain (west) from the broad Canterbury Plains (east). Fiordland National Park in the southwest is a distinctive area with its numerous coastal fjords (inlets) and high lakes. The park is part of the Te Wahipounamu (South West New Zealand) area of protected wilderness along the west side of the island that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1990. In addition, five island groups off the southern coast (the Snares, Bounty Islands, Antipodes Islands, Auckland Islands, and Campbell Islands), which make up the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands, were named another World Heritage site in 1998.
South Island was sighted by the Dutch navigator Abel Janszoon Tasman in 1642. Although the island has several large urban areas—including Christchurch, Dunedin, and Invercargill, all coastal—its population has grown less rapidly than that of North Island. Area 58,776 square miles (152,229 square km). Pop. (2006) 967,908; (2012 est.) 1,038,500.
