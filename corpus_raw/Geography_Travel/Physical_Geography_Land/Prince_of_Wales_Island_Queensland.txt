Prince of Wales Island,  island, largest of those in the Torres Strait connecting the Coral Sea with the Arafura Sea, 10 miles (16 km) northwest of the tip of Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, Australia. It has an area of about 70 square miles (180 square km). Rugged and wooded, the island rises to 761 feet (232 metres). It has little arable land and no permanent sources of fresh water; there are no suitable landings for ships. Pearl shell was exported, but the decline in world demand for pearl shell since the 1950s has led many islanders to migrate to Queensland.
