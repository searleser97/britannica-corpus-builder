Rocky Mountain Trench,   geological depression extending north-northwest for about 900 miles (1,400 km) from western Montana, U.S., south of Flathead Lake, through British Columbia, Can., to the headwaters of the Yukon River. The trench parallels the steep western face of the Rockies, separating them from the older western ranges. Its rugged floor, which is 2–10 miles (3–16 km) wide and 2,000–3,000 feet (600–900 m) above sea level, forms a natural travel route. The depression is occupied in part by several rivers, including the headwaters of such rivers as the Kootenay, Fraser, Peace, Columbia, and Liard.
