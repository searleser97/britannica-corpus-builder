Mindoro,  island, west-central Philippines. It lies across the Verde Island Passage from Luzon (northeast) and between the Mindoro (southwest) and Tablas (southeast) straits. Unlike the majority of its sister islands, Mindoro has no deep coastal embayments or fringing islets.
A mountainous core extending for 100 miles (160 km) along the island’s entire length is surrounded by a broken coastal plain, widest along the eastern shore. Lake Naujan and Mount Halcon (8,481 feet [2,585 metres]), the island’s highest point, are in the northeast. Steep-sided valleys are formed by rivers, including the Pandan, Ibod, and Bongabong. The tamaraw (tamarau), a small water buffalo, is unique to Mindoro.
Historically, Mindoro’s population growth was kept in check through raids by Muslim (Moro) seafarers from the southern islands and by the prevalence of malaria. Since 1948 the island has been one of the nation’s resettlement areas, which has lent a frontier aspect to its life. The inhabitants of the rugged interior are non-Christian, seminomadic peoples who practice slash-and-burn (kaingin) farming; they include Negritos and Hanunóo. Coastal areas, especially in the west, are more densely populated and commercialized and are settled primarily by Christian Tagalogs, particularly from the Batangas Peninsula of Luzon. Hiligaynon peoples have migrated to the southern areas.
The University of the Philippines maintains a marine biological station at Puerto Galera on the northern coast. There are substantial deposits of coal in the south. The island’s main population centres are Calapan and Mamburao. Portions of Mindoro sustained heavy damage from Super Typhoon Haiyan, a powerful tropical cyclone that swept through the region in early November 2013. Area 3,759 square miles (9,735 square km). Pop. (2000) including adjacent islands, 1,062,068; (2010) including adjacent islands, 1,238,573.
