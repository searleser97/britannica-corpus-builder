Shipka Pass, Bulgarian Shipchenski Prokhod,  pass in the Balkan Mountains, Bulgaria. Situated on the main road from Ruse on the Danube River through Stara Zagora to Edirne (Adrianople) in Turkey, it was a strategically important pass and was the scene of fierce fighting during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78). The pass was originally held by a Turkish force of 4,000 men, but the Russian general I.V. Gurko seized it by surprise in July 1877. In response, the Turkish general Süleyman Paşa attacked Shipka in August. The Russian force there, which included 7,500 Bulgarian volunteers, held the position against Süleyman’s 30,000 Turks, and the fighting continued until late September, when both sides entrenched themselves in the pass. After the capitulation of the Turkish forces at Pleven, Bulg., in December, the Russians began a general advance, and, in January 1878, General F.F. Radetsky attacked the Turks at Shipka Pass. The fall of Pleven made Turkish resistance strategically useless, and so, on January 9, General Vessil Paşa (who had succeeded Süleyman) surrendered.
The Russians had lost 5,500 men in the battle for Shipka Pass, while the Turks had lost approximately 13,000. The way Süleyman had sacrificed his men earned him the name of the “Shipka butcher.”
