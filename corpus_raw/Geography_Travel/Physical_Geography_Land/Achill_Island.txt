Achill Island,  mountainous island off the west coast of Ireland. It is part of County Mayo, joined to the mainland by a bridge across Achill Sound. The island is Irelandâ€™s largest, with an area of 56 square miles (145 square km), and its highest points are the quartzite peaks of Slieve Croaghaun (2,182 feet [665 metres]) and Slieve More (2,201 feet [671 metres]). The landscape is dominated by wild moorlands and spectacular coastal scenery. Farming and fishing are vital to the economy. With its many beaches and fine cliffs, the island attracts a significant number of tourists. An annual seafood festival is held during the summer. In the south, at Kildavnet, there are ruins of a 12th-century church and a 15th-century castle.
