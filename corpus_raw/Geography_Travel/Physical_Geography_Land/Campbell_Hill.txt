Campbell Hill,  highest point (1,549 feet [472 metres]) in Ohio, U.S. It lies in Logan county, just east of Bellefontaine, in the west-central part of the state. Located in a scenic recreational area of springs and smoke-blue morainal hills rich in Indian lore, it was named for Charles O. Campbell, who once owned the land. Zane and Ohio caverns, Indian Lake State Park, and a downhill skiing area are nearby.
