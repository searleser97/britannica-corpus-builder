Rodrigues Island,  island dependency of the western Indian Ocean state of Mauritius. It lies 344 miles (553 km) east of the island of Mauritius. Of volcanic origin, Rodrigues Island has an area of 40 square miles (104 square km). The island was apparently uninhabited when it was sighted by the Portuguese in 1507. It was first successfully colonized by the French, who used slaves to cultivate sugar plantations. The British received the island from the French at the end of the Napoleonic Wars (1800–15), and the French settlers were evacuated, leaving their slaves behind. Most of the Rodriguans are descended from those slaves; there are also a few Chinese and Indo-Mauritian immigrants.
The island’s economy is based mainly on subsistence agriculture and fishing. There is a small export of salted fish, animals, and crops (especially onions and chilies), and the outflow of labour to the island of Mauritius is fairly large. Port Mathurin, the main town, has a small harbour with regular steamer service to Mauritius. Pop. (2005 est.) 36,907.
