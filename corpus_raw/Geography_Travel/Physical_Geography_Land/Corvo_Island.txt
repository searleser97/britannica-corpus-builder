Corvo Island, Portuguese Ilha Do Corvo,  volcanic island, northernmost of the Azores, east-central North Atlantic. With an area of 6.8 square miles (17.6 square km), it rises to 2,549 feet (777 m) at Mount Gordo. Lying only 10 miles (16 km) north of Flores, it suffers for nine months of the year from winter weather. Air links have eased the island’s former isolation. The island has only one town, Vila Corvo (southeast). Wool is produced on the island. Corvo is the Portuguese word for “raven.”
