Santa María Island, Spanish Isla Santa María, also called Charles Island,  one of the southernmost Galapagos Islands, in the eastern Pacific Ocean about 600 miles (965 km) west of mainland  Ecuador. Originally named for the British king Charles II, it is also known as Isla Floreana, but the official Ecuadoran name is Isla Santa María. The island, with an area of 64 square miles (166 square km), has central volcanic craters reaching an elevation of 1,800 feet (550 metres) and sloping verdant hills leading to the sandy shore. It was the site of the first Galapagos settlements and of an 18th-century whaler’s post office. In 1832 General José Villamil claimed the Galapagos for Ecuador and established a colony for political prisoners. Norwegian immigrants settled on Santa María in 1927 but did not remain. Fruit, subsistence crops, cattle, and fishing are the economic activities of small settlements, and tourism is important.
