Sylt,  largest and northernmost of the North Frisian Islands, in the North Sea, Schleswig-Holstein Land (state), Germany. Sylt, which occupies an area of 38 square miles (99 square km), is connected by rail with the mainland via the 7-mile- (11-km-) long Hindenburgdamm (causeway). Extending in length more than 22 miles (35 km), Sylt is in some places only 0.5 mile (1 km) wide, but from the centre of its east coast a beaklike peninsula juts toward the Schleswig-Holstein mainland. A magnificent beach extends along the smooth west coast, where the Red Cliffs of glacial moraine rise to nearly 100 feet (30 metres). The island is dotted with prehistoric megalithic tombs and other structures. There are scattered villages such as Keitum and a few small farms with dairy cattle and sheep. Tourism is the economic mainstay, based on resorts such as List, Westerland, and Wenningstedt-Braderup. Sylt lies within Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park (the largest national park in central Europe).
