Bornholm,  Danish island in the Baltic Sea, 105 miles (169 km) southeast of Copenhagen and 22 miles (35 km) southeast of Sweden. Once a Viking stronghold, independent until the 10th century, it was controlled by Sweden and then, in the 16th century, by Lübeck (a German city of the Hanseatic League). Awarded to Sweden by the Treaty of Roskilde (1658), Bornholm was turned over to Denmark in 1660. It was occupied by the Germans during World War II and was bombed by the Russians in 1945 to hasten the German surrender.
The northern two-thirds of the island is composed of granite with a rocky cliff coast and a high-lying wooded interior. The more populous southern part forms an undulating surface of sandstone, limestone, and shale, with a dune coast. The moderately fertile soil supports grains, dairy farming, and pig raising. Principal exports are fish (herring, salmon, and cod), granite, porcelain, and pottery. Tourism became increasingly important in the 21st century, and the clear, clean waters off Dueodde Strand drew beachgoers from across Europe.
Medieval remains include four of Denmark’s six 12th-century round churches (fortress-churches) and the ruins of the imposing 13th-century castle of Hammershus (former stronghold of the bishops of Lund, Sweden), now a historical monument. There are also Viking relics. The island is centred on Rønne (its seat, dating from the 12th century) and Neksø. Area 227 square miles (588 square km). Pop. (2018 est.) 39,632.
