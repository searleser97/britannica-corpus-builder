Maar,  small crater blasted by a low-temperature volcanic explosion and not associated with a volcanic cone. The rim of ejected fragmental material around the crater often is very low and inconspicuous. The best known of these are in the nearly horizontal, nonvolcanic rocks of the Eifel region in Germany; many contain beautiful little blue lakes. Similar explosion craters have been found in flat-lying rocks in other regions.
