South Uist,  island of the Outer Hebrides, Western Isles council area, historic county of Inverness-shire, Scotland. It lies west of the island of Skye, from which it is separated by about 25 miles (40 km) of water. The island is 20 miles (30 km) north to south and 7 miles (11 km) wide and is connected by road bridges northward to the islands of Benbecula and North Uist. The east side of South Uist is mountainous—Beinn Mhor reaches an elevation of 2,033 feet (620 metres)—and much indented. It has poor soil with peat bogs and heather. The western side, however, has a belt of arable land derived from shell sand. Stock raising is the chief occupation, but islanders also engage in crofting (small-scale tenant farming, mainly for subsistence), fishing, and seaweed processing. Tweeds are woven on the island. Tourism is very important to the local economy.  Lochboisdale, on the east coast, is the main village. About four-fifths of the people speak Scottish Gaelic. Pop. (2001) 1,818; (2011) 1,754.
