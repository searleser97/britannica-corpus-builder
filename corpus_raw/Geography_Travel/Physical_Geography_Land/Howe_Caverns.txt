Howe Caverns,  series of underground caves in Schoharie county, east-central New York, U.S. The site is located 38 miles (61 km) west of Albany. Named for Lester Howe, who is credited with their discovery in 1842, the limestone caves are 160–200 feet (50–60 metres) below the surface. They contain grotesque rock formations (stalactites and stalagmites); underground channels, including the “Styx River”; and a lake. In 1929 an electrical system of lighting and communication was installed; the caves, with an even temperature of 52° F (11° C), are reached by elevators. A winding passageway 30–60 feet (9–18 metres) wide, 10–60 feet (3–18 metres) high, and 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long is the main route for sightseeing. Gondola-style boat rides are available on the  “mirror-perfect” Lake of Venus, which is 660 feet (201 metres) long. The community of Howes Cave is near the entrance, and Secret Caverns, a second group of caves (with underground waterfalls and fossilized marine life), are nearby.
