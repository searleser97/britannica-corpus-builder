Kipuka,   area of land ranging from several square metres to several square kilometres where existing rock of either volcanic or nonvolcanic origin has been completely surrounded, but not covered, by later lava flows. Surface features of this type are common in Hawaii, where the term kipuka (“opening”) originated. A kipuka that protrudes above the surrounding lava field is classified as a steptoe (q.v.); it results from the branching of a lava stream around a topographic rise. This kind of kipuka can be easily distinguished from the adjacent lava flow because it has older vegetation growing on it. A kipuka that is lower than the surrounding lava field forms as a result of irregular lava flow or the union of lava flows from two distinct streams. Kipukas provide readily accessible information about the older rock buried beneath the lava flow.
