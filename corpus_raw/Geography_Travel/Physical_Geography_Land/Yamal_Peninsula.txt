Yamal Peninsula, Russian Poluostrov Yamal,  Arctic lowland region in northwestern Siberia, west-central Russia. It is bounded on the west by the Kara Sea and Baydarata Bay, on the east and southeast by the Gulf of Ob, and on the north by the Malygina Strait.
The peninsula has a total length of 435 miles (700 km), a maximum width of 150 miles (240 km), and an area of 47,100 square miles (122,000 square km). The coasts of Yamal are mainly low-lying and sandy, whereas the inland region, rising in the south to a maximum height of 300 feet (90 metres), has an irregular surface much affected by marine and glacial deposition. Drainage is exceedingly poor. Large natural gas deposits have been discovered across the peninsula and in nearby offshore regions, and by the early 21st century the exploitation of the area’s extensive reserves had begun in earnest. Yamal in the Nenets language means “land’s end.”
