Caldey Island, also spelled Caldy Island, Welsh Ynys Bŷr,  island in Carmarthen Bay of the Bristol Channel, Pembrokeshire (Sir Benfro) county, southwestern Wales. It lies 2.3 miles (3.7 km) south of the port of Tenby. The island is 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and 1 mile (1.6 km) across at its widest.
Since at least the 6th century, when it was inhabited by Celtic monks, Caldey has been associated with religious communities. In 1906 it was bought by Anglican Benedictines, who built the present monastery and abbey, but in 1928 they were succeeded by Trappists from Belgium, who farm the island and make perfumes and toiletries from herbs they grow. Its sister island to the west, St. Margaret’s, is a seal and bird sanctuary. Both islands are within Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and are popular with tourists and naturalists. Caldey contains a small community and a lighthouse and is accessible by boat from Tenby..
