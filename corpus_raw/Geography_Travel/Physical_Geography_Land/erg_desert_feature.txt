Erg, also called Sand Sea,  in a desert region, area of large accumulation of sand, generally in the bottom of a huge basin in which a former river piled up alluvium. Ergs are areas of actively shifting dunes, “fossilized” dunes, or extensive sand sheets. The sand is generally loose and is extremely difficult to cross. In the Sahara Desert between Beni Abbès in Algeria and Ghadāmis in Libya, the Great Western and Great Eastern ergs are the most difficult of all Saharan areas and are generally avoided by modern trans-Saharan routes. The Libyan Desert is another extensive area of unmitigated sandy waste.
