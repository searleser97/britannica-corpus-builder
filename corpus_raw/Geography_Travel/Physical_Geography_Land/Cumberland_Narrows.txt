Cumberland Narrows,  scenic gorge 1,000 feet (305 metres) deep in Allegany county, northwestern Maryland, U.S., just northwest of Cumberland city. Cut by Wills Creek, it provides a natural east-west gateway, located between Wills and Haystack mountains, across the Allegheny Mountains. The gap, which was initially an Indian footpath, was discovered in 1755 by a vanguard unit of British and colonial troops led by General Edward Braddock in an ill-fated attempt to move westward across the mountains and expel the French from the Ohio River valley. The route was developed into the Cumberland (or National) Road, also known as the National Pike, the first federally funded highway (authorized in 1806 by Congress and built between Cumberland and Wheeling, West Virginia). It was later improved as part of U.S. Route 40, running from New Jersey to California; the gap, however, has now been bypassed by Interstate 68. A tollhouse at La Vale has been preserved.
