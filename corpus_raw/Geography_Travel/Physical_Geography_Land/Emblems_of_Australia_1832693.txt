 Australia has a federal form of government, with a central government and six constituent statesâ€”New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. Each state has its own government, which exercises a limited degree of sovereignty. There are also two internal territories: Northern Territory, established as a self-governing territory in 1978, and the Australian Capital Territory (including the city of Canberra), which attained self-governing status in 1988. Both the central and regional governments have adopted representative symbols. Many of them are flora and fauna unique to Australia and its neighbouring islands.
The table provides a list of Australian emblems.
