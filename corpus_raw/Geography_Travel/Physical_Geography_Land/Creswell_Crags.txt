Creswell Crags,  ravine about 1,500 feet (450 m) long, near Creswell in northeastern Derbyshire, Eng. It contains caves that have yielded one of the most important British series of extinct vertebrate remains, accompanied by implements of Paleolithic hunters. Creswell Crags was first excavated in 1875, and scientific investigations continued into the 21st century. Although traces of Mousterian artifacts have been found, the best-attested evidence of human occupation belongs to the so-called Creswellian culture, widely regarded as a provincial variant of the later Magdalenian culture of southwestern France and assigned to the final episodes of the Würm glaciation. The accompanying remains of mammalian fauna include reindeer, woolly rhinoceros, mammoth, and wild horse. In 2003 the most-northerly Ice Age cave art and the first ever found in Britain—a suite of 12,000-year-old engravings of various creatures—was discovered at Creswell Crags. The faint engravings are similar in style to those at Lascaux Grotto in France and Altamira in Spain.
