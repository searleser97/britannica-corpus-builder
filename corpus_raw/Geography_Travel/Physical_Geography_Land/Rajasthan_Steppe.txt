Rajasthan Steppe,  desert in west-central Rajasthan state, northwestern India. It has an area of about 54,800 square miles (142,000 square km). The region was ruled successively in ancient times by the Mauryas, Guptas, and Gurjar Pratiharas. Later it was ruled by Rajput dynasties before coming under Mughal control.
Near Jodhpur is bedrock similar to that of the Vindhya Range; farther south there are Malani volcanic and Jalore Siwana granitic rocks. The region slopes downward from the Aravalli Range in the northeast to the Luni River basin in the southeast, where rocks above the sandy surface bear evidence of wind erosion. Rajasthan Steppe has also been subject to extensive gullying. Large areas are covered with thorny scrub, acacia, and palm trees. The Luni is the only major river; the inland drainage pattern has created a number of salt lakes, such as the Didwana, Kuchman, Degna, and Sambhar. The desert soils contain a high percentage of soluble salts.
Livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) raising and agriculture are economically important; cereal grains, pulses (legumes), oilseeds, cotton, and sugarcane are grown. The region suffers occasionally from severe droughts and swarms of locusts. It is rich in mineral resources (especially marble and salt), and gypsum, silver ore, and feldspar are mined; there is a sulfur plant at Sambhar Salt Lake. Rugs and woolen textiles, sugar, cement, pesticides, and dyes are produced. Jodhpur, Ganganagar, Churu, and Jhunjhunu are the important towns and cities in the region.
