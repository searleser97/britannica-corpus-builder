Zoji,  pass across the Himalayas in the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. Situated at an elevation of 11,580 feet (3,529 metres), Zoji Pass carries the main route leading from Srinagar in the Vale of Kashmir eastward to Leh, in Ladakh union territory, and on to Tibet. Heavily forested, the pass is the lowest in the western axis of the Himalayas but is extremely precipitous on the south side.
