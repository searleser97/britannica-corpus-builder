Misool Island, Indonesian Pulau Misool,  island in the Raja Ampat group in the Ceram Sea, West Papua (Papua Barat) province, Indonesia. Misool is located about 40 miles (64 km) southwest of the Doberai (Vogelkop) Peninsula of the island of New Guinea. Flat lowlands cover the coastal regions except in the south, which is hilly and mountainous; the hills in the central part of the island reach an elevation of 3,250 feet (990 metres). The climate is hot, with heavy rainfall; seasonal streams flow seaward from the central highlands, where there are dense hardwood forests. The island is sparsely populated by Papuans, some of whom engage in seminomadic hunting and gathering. Some also produce sago and fish, which are exported to the Inanwatan and Taminabuan ports of the mainland of West Papua. The chief settlements are Adua, on the western tip of the island, and Lelintah, in the southeast.
