Saipan,  island, one of the Mariana Islands and part of the Northern Mariana Islands commonwealth of the United States, in the western Pacific Ocean. The island is hilly, rising to an elevation of 1,545 feet (471 metres) at Mount Takpochao (Tagpochau); it is 14 miles (23 km) long and 5 miles (8 km) across at its widest point. Broad inlets (Laolao [Magicienne] Bay and Tanapag Harbor) are on both its sides. The smaller island of Tinian lies immediately southwest across the Saipan Channel. The seat of government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is on Saipan; the executive and legislative branches are headquartered at Capital Hill, and the judiciary meets at Susupe.
Saipan was under Spanish sovereignty from 1565 to 1899 and came under German rule from 1899 to 1914. It was made a Japanese mandate in 1920. During World War II the successful U.S.-led Allied invasion and capture of the island (June–July 1944) was one of the fiercest land battles in the Pacific theatre. Some 3,500 U.S. troops died in the fighting, and nearly all of the 30,000 Japanese defenders were killed; thousands of Japanese civilians also died, many jumping to their deaths off Banzai Cliff, at the northern end of the island, rather than face capture. Saipan became an important U.S. military air base during the last year of the war, and between 1953 and 1962 it was under U.S. naval jurisdiction. Saipan served as headquarters of the U.S.-administered United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 1962 to 1986.
Subsistence crops include taro, cassava, yams, breadfruit, and bananas. Tourism and its related industries are Saipan’s economic mainstay. Saipan has a commercial dock and an international airport. Area 46.5 square miles (120 square km). Pop. (2000) 62,392; (2010) 48,220.
