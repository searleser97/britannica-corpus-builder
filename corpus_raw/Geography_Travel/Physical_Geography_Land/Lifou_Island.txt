Lifou Island, also spelled Lifu Island, also called (locally) Drehu,  largest and most populous of the Loyalty Islands in the French overseas country of New Caledonia, southwestern Pacific Ocean. It is the central island of the group. Lifou rises no higher than 200 feet (60 metres) above sea level. The coralline limestone creates a fertile soil but also precludes the existence of surface streams, so fresh water can be found only in caves and wells. The inhabitants grow taro, yams, and bananas and produce copra for export. The provincial capital of the Loyalty Islands, Wé, is on Lifou’s east coast; Chépénéhé, on Sandal Bay on the west coast, is the chief town. Area 466 square miles (1,207 square km). Pop. (2004) 10,320.
