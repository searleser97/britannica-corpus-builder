Submarine slump,   in a submarine canyon or on a continental slope, relatively rapid and sporadic downslope composed of sediment and organic debris that has built up slowly into an unstable or marginally stable mass. The greatest documented distance that an individual slump has transported sediment is 120 m (400 feet), in Scripps Canyon off La Jolla, Calif. After an individual slump in a canyon, however, the material tends to continue falling in a series of slumps until the sediment mass attains a lesser, more stable slope. A slumping episode may trigger other slumps farther down the canyon or may create turbid, dense slurries of water and sediment, which flow downslope as turbidity currents.
