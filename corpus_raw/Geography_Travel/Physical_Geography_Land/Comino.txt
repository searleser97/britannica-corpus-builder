Comino, Maltese Kemmuna,  one of the Maltese islands, in the Mediterranean Sea, separated from Malta to the southeast and Gozo to the northwest by narrow channels. It has an area of 1 square mile (3 square km). Comino boasts three popular beaches—St. Nicholas Bay, St. Mary’s Bay, and the sought-after Blue Lagoon (also known as Bejn il-Kmiemen). Apart from the stretch of beaches, Comino’s coastline is sharp and craggy. Comino was the site of a fortress of the Hospitallers (Knights of Malta, or Knights of St. John of Jerusalem); a tower (1618) of the fortress survives. Beeswax and grapes are produced as well as honey of a very fine quality. Goats, sheep, and pigs are also bred. In addition to the tourist population that frequents the island’s single resort, Comino has a handful of permanent residents.
