Cape Bojador, also spelled Cape Boujdour,  extension of the West African coast into the Atlantic Ocean, now part of the Western Sahara. Located on a dangerous reef-lined stretch of the coast, its Arabic name, Abū Khaṭar, means “the father of danger.” It was first successfully passed by the Portuguese navigator Captain Gil Eanes in 1434. Subsequently the Portuguese exploited the region, particularly for slaves. After 1450 the area was disputed by both Spain and Portugal. Spain finally gained the region in 1860 by the Treaty of Tetuan with Morocco, and in 1884 officially annexed it. A lighthouse was built on the cape in the early 20th century to aid shipping. After Spain withdrew from the Western Sahara in 1976, Morocco claimed the cape, built a desalination plant and barracks for a military garrison there, and made the settlement the capital of the newly created province of Boujdour. A paved road links Cape Bojador with El-Aaiún, to the north.
