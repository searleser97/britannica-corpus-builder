Qattara Depression, Qattara also spelled Qaṭṭārah,  arid Libyan Desert (Eastern Saharan) basin in northwestern Egypt. It covers about 7,000 square miles (18,100 square km) and contains salt lakes and marshes, and it descends to 435 feet (133 metres) below sea level. During World War II, because it was impassable to military traffic, the depression formed a natural anchor at the southern end of the British defense lines at El-Alamein (Al-ʿAlamayn; in northwestern Egypt) against the final advance of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel’s German army in July 1942. In the late 1970s oil deposits were discovered in the southern part of the depression.
