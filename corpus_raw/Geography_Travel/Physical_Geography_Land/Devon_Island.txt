Devon Island,  largest of the Parry Islands, in Nunavut, Canada, in the Arctic Ocean south of Ellesmere Island and west of Baffin Bay. It is about 320 miles (515 km) long, 80–100 miles (130–160 km) wide, and has an area of 21,331 square miles (55,247 square km). Chiefly an ice-covered plateau, the island rises from about 2,000 feet (600 metres) in the west to reach a maximum elevation of 6,300 feet (1,920 metres) in the east. Fjordlike inlets indent its southern coast, and Grinnell Peninsula protrudes northwest. Discovered by William Baffin in 1616, it was formerly named North Devon.
