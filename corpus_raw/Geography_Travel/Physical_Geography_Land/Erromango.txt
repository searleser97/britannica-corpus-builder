Erromango, also spelled Eromanga,  volcanic island of Vanuatu, in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The island, with an area of 376 square miles (975 square km), rises in the interior to 2,907 feet (886 metres) at Santop. It had a sandalwood trade beginning in 1825; overexploitation caused almost total depletion of the trees by the end of the 19th century, but some small private plantations have now been established to grow sandalwood for export. There are significant stands of other timber on Erromango, primarily kauri pine and assorted hardwoods that are harvested by foreign logging companies. The island has no adequate harbours, and the only good anchorage is Cook Bay, on the east coast. There are two airstrips, at Dillon Bay in the west and Ipota in the east. Copra is produced.
