Tufa cave,  umbrella-like canopy formed as a calcium-carbonate-saturated stream plunges over a cliff. As the water is aerated, carbon dioxide is released, causing the calcium carbonate to be deposited. Tufa caves may completely bridge a river, forming a natural tunnel. One of the largest such caves is Tonto Natural Bridge near Payson, Ariz.
