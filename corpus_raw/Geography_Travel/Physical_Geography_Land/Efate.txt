Éfaté, also called Vaté, formerly Sandwich,  main island of Vanuatu, in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It is volcanic in origin and occupies an area of 353 square miles (915 square km). Its highest peak is Mount Macdonald, which rises to 2,123 feet (647 metres). Éfaté’s terrain is rugged and covered by tropical rain forest, nurtured by the island’s warm and humid climate. The island is subject to frequent earthquakes, and a series of strong offshore tremors caused widespread damage in 2002.
Port-Vila, the capital of Vanuatu, lies on the southwest coast of Éfaté and is home to about two-thirds of the island’s residents; it has a good harbour (Mélé Bay), which contains a small private island, Iririki. There is also an international airport. Port Havannah, on the northwest coast, provides good anchorage. The island produces copra, cacao, and kava root; cattle and sheep are raised; and there are growing lumber and tourist industries. Manganese ore was mined at Forari until deposits were exhausted in 1979.
