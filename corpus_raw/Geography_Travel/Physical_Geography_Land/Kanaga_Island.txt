Kanaga Island,  one of the Andreanof Islands of the Aleutian Islands chain, southwestern Alaska, U.S. The uninhabited island measures 30 miles (50 km) long and 4 to 8 miles (6.5 to 13 km) wide; its northern tip is the site of the Kanaga Volcano, which rises to 4,287 feet (1,307 metres) and is roughly 3 miles (5 km) in diameter at its base. It is separated from Tanaga Island by the Kanaga Pass (water passage). Kanaga may be the island called Kanaton by the British navigator Captain James Cook in 1778.
