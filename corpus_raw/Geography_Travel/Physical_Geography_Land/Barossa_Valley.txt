Barossa Valley,  important wine-producing region of South Australia, located 30 miles (48 km) northeast of Adelaide in the Mount Lofty Ranges. The valley, drained by the North Para River, is about 19 miles (30 km) long and 5 miles (8 km) wide. It was named in 1837 by its surveyor for a battle fought near Barrosa, Cádiz, Spain (although subsequently spelled differently), and was settled by Prussians and Silesians in 1838. The area has an excellent climate with reliable winter rains and dry, sunny summers, and its subsoil is especially suited to viticulture. From its grapes are produced a substantial proportion of Australia’s light table wines, and the valley holds a wine festival in odd-numbered years. The Barossa Valley is one of the largest contributing and exporting regions of Australia’s wine industry. Supplementary farming yields honey, olive oil, fruits, and citrus juices. The valley’s principal towns are Tanunda, Nuriootpa, and Angaston. A second, smaller wine region is in the nearby Barossa Hills.
