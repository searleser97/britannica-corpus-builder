Langeland,  island belonging to Denmark, in the Baltic Sea between Funen and Lolland islands. Langeland’s castle of Tranekær has been a royal residence since 1231 (rebuilt 1550), and its principal town, Rudkøbing, was chartered in 1287. The undulating, well-wooded land has fertile clay loams that support grain, and cattle and pigs are raised. There is a well-preserved Stone Age barrow in the southern part of the island, and Rudkøbing has several medieval churches and houses. A series of bridges connect Langeland to the rest of Denmark, but such links have not prevented steady depopulation of the island. Area 110 square miles (284 square km).
