Great Bahama Canyon,   submarine canyon in the Atlantic Ocean off the Bahamas, one of the greatest yet discovered. It lies northeast of the Great Bahama Bank, between Great Abaco and Eleuthera islands. Two main branches, the Tongue of the Ocean and Northwest Providence, merge to form the canyon itself. The vertical rock walls of the Great Bahama Canyon rise 14,060 feet (4,285 m) from the canyon floor to the surrounding seabed. The Great Bahama Canyon has been traced for more than 140 miles (225 km) in length but could extend as far as the base of the steep part of the North American continental slope. It has a width of 23 miles (37 km) at its deepest point and an average floor slope of about 300 feet per mile (60 m per km).
