Hiva Oa,  largest island of the southeastern Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia, central South Pacific. The volcanic island’s mountainous slopes rise directly from the sea, reaching an elevation of some 4,000 feet (1,200 metres) at Mount Temetiu. There is neither a coastal plain nor a fringing coral reef. Hiva Oa was sighted by the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira in 1595 and had a small sandalwood trade in the 19th century. The island’s rugged terrain limits present-day agriculture to the narrow valley floors, with the exception of the Ahao Plateau, at an elevation of 1,000 feet (305 metres). Copra, the island’s only export, is shipped from Atuona, which is the main village and port of the Marquesas Islands and lies on the Baie des Traîtres (Bay of Traitors).
The French artist Paul Gauguin lived on Hiva Oa in his last two years (1901–03) and is buried at Atuona. Area 122 square miles (315 square km). Pop. (2017) 2,243.
