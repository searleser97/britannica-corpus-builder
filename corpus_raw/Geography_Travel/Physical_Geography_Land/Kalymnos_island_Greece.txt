Kálymnos, also spelled Kálimnos,  mountainous Greek island and dímos (municipality) in the Aegean Sea, part of the Dodecanese (Modern Greek: Dodekánisa) group, 42 square miles (111 square km) in area. Along with other islands, it constitutes the perifereiakí enótita (regional unit) of Kálymnos in the South Aegean (Nótio Aigaío) periféreia (region) of southern Greece. The town of Kálymnos, located at the head of an inlet in the southeast, is the chief port and a prominent Aegean commercial centre with the bulk of the island’s population. As in Classical times, sponge fishing remains the chief industry, with the sponge fleet away to the North African coast for up to six months each year after Easter. Toward the centre of the island, the volcanic valley of Vathys, irrigated from springs, supports citrus, olives, figs, and vines. The island is the seat of a metropolitan bishop of the Greek Orthodox Church.
Believed to have been settled by a Dorian colony from Epidaurus in the Peloponnese, the island coined its own money and took part in the first and second Athenian leagues (5th and 4th centuries bce). As a Persian satrapy, it was conquered in 332 by the Macedonian forces of Alexander the Great and was later annexed by Rome to the province of Asia. Until 1310 ce it was occupied by Venetians, who then gave way to the Knights of Rhodes (the future Knights of Malta). In 1522 it was captured with the other islands of the Dodecanese by the Turks, and in 1912 it was occupied by Italy. The people of Kálymnos resisted Italianization, and during World War II many fled to Turkey. The necropolis of Damos and more than 100 ancient Greek inscriptions are among the antiquities found or excavated on the island. Pop. (2001) municipality, 16,576; (2011) municipality, 16,179.
