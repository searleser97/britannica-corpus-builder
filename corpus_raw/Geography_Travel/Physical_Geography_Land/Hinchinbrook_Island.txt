Hinchinbrook Island,   island off the northeastern coast of Queensland, Australia. It is situated opposite the port of Cardwell and 60 miles (95 km) northeast of Townsville. About 22 miles (35 km) long and 152 square miles (394 square km) in area, it is separated from the mainland by Hinchinbrook Channel. The thickly wooded, mountainous island, now a national park, is noted for its waterfalls and caves. Its rugged bluffs include Mount Bowen, Mount Diamantina, and The Thumbâ€”all exceeding 3,000 feet (900 m) in height. Hinchinbrook was named in 1770 by Captain James Cook after the family seat of his patron, George M. Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax; it was not until 1819, however, that the British surveyor Captain Phillip King identified it as an island.
