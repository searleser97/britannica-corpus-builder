Port Royal,  island and town, Beaufort county, southern South Carolina, U.S., at the head of Port Royal Sound on the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. The island of Port Royal is one of the Sea Islands, and its principal town is Beaufort. The town of Port Royal is on the southern tip of the island, which is about 13 miles (21 km) long and 7 miles (11 km) wide.
The area was visited by Spanish explorers early in the 16th century. In 1562 the French Huguenot Jean Ribaut sailed into the sound and called it Port Royal. He then established one of the first European settlements in North America, Charlesfort, probably on southern Parris Island (just to the south of Port Royal Island), and left 30 men there. In 1563 the settlers killed their leader and returned to Europe. The Spanish occupied the area more or less continuously from 1566 to 1650, maintaining garrisons and Indian missions. English claims to Carolina grew with the settlement of Charleston in 1670, and gradually planters moved into the area. In 1710 the present town of Beaufort was established. In January 1779, during the American Revolution, the British occupied the area but were soon dislodged. Early in the American Civil War (November 6â€“7, 1861), 56 Union vessels and 12,000 men under General Thomas W. Sherman reduced the Confederate fortifications. The port was used as a Union coaling and repair station for the remainder of the war.
The economy now depends mainly on light industry, the U.S. Marine Corps installation at Parris Island (which was annexed by Port Royal town in 2002), and tourism. The town was incorporated in 1874. Pop. (2000) 3,950; (2010) 10,678.
