Latrobe Valley, Latrobe also spelled La Trobe,  river valley in southeastern Victoria, Australia. It is one of the most important economic areas in the state.
The Latrobe River rises in the Eastern Highlands near Mount Baw Baw in the Gippsland district. Flowing in a southeasterly direction, it passes the cities of Moe and Yallourn, where it turns to flow almost directly east, past Traralgon. The Latrobe is joined by its main tributaries, the Thomson and Macalister rivers, near Sale, 6 miles (10 km) from where it enters Lake Wellington, one of the Gippsland lakes. Originally called the Glengarry, the 70-mile- (112-kilometre-) long river was renamed to honour Charles La Trobe, first lieutenant governor of Victoria. The seasonal variations in its flow are marked.
Near the river’s mouth, agriculture—primarily dairying—is the main economic activity. Farther west, the middle Latrobe Valley has one of the world’s largest deposits of brown coal; it has been exploited since 1919. There are large thermal power stations at Yallourn, Morwell, Loy Yang, and Hazelwood, all fueled by coal, and briquettes are produced. The valley also has some forestry, which supplies its wood pulp and paper mills, and there is a plant that processes natural gas.
