Melville Island,  one of the largest of the Parry Islands, in the Arctic Ocean, divided between the Northwest Territories and Nunavut territory, Canada. Separated from Victoria Island (south) by Viscount Melville Sound and from Banks Island (southwest) by McClure Strait, Melville Island is about 200 miles (320 km) long and 30–130 miles (50–210 km) wide with an area of 16,274 square miles (42,149 square km). Deeply indented by Hecla and Griper Bay on the north coast and by Liddon Gulf on the southwest, the island rises in the northwest to 3,500 feet (1,067 metres). It has no human habitation but supports musk-oxen and has natural-gas deposits. Discovered (1819) by Sir William Parry, it was named for Robert Saunders Dundas, 2nd Viscount Melville, then first lord of the Admiralty.
