Karm Island,  island, southwestern Norway. It lies in the North Sea just north of the mouth of Bokna Fjord. With its principal axis running north–south, Karm Island is about 19 miles (31 km) long and 6 miles (10 km) across at its widest point and has an area of 68 square miles (176 square km). It is separated from the mainland by narrow Karm Strait. Karm is hilly and has numerous mounds and burial sites dating to the Stone and Bronze ages. Olaf I Tryggvason, first Christian king of Norway (reigned 995–c. 1000), lived at Avaldsnes, at the island’s north end, near which stands a 13th-century church and a runic stone, 26 feet (8 metres) long, called the Virgin Mary’s Needle. Most of the island’s inhabitants live in coastal fishing villages; fishing (herring, mackerel, and lobster) and farming (grains and fruit) are among the principal occupations. Kopervik is the largest town. Just off the northern tip of the island is the mainland port of Haugesund. Pop. (2007 est.) 38,349.
