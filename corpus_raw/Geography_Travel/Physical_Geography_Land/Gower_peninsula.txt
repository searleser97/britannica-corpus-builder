Gower, also called Gower Peninsula, Welsh Gŵyr,  peninsula in Swansea city and county, historic county of Glamorgan (Morgannwg), Wales, extending southwest into the Bristol Channel. The old Welsh province of Gŵyr, from which the name is derived, also included extensive tracts to the north.
Gower is mainly a plateau, 150–450 feet (45–140 metres) high, into which many short streams have incised narrow, steep-sided valleys. Above the rolling plateau surfaces are some ridges, such as that from Penclawdd to Swansea, across the neck of the peninsula, and the Cefn Bryn ridge in the west. The picturesque south coast has a succession of limestone cliffs and coves that attract tourists. The Mumbles, a popular resort area at Oystermouth, takes its name from the French mamelles (“breasts”), a reference to the two small islands off the coast. Farther west are large stretches of sand dunes, such as Llangennith and Whitford Burrows. The latter, together with parts of the south coast cliffs, is now in the care of the National Trust. The north coast, which bounds the Burry Inlet of Carmarthen Bay, is marshy and attracts fewer visitors.
From Paleolithic times humans have occupied the peninsula. A skeleton discovered in a cave in 1823 is Paleolithic in age, and barrows and megaliths are evidence of later prehistoric communities. Traces of a Roman villa have been found at Oystermouth, and Celtic monks founded cells in the early Middle Ages. With the Norman Conquest of Gower (c. 1100), the southern part of the peninsula received an influx of Flemish and other settlers and came to be known as Gower Anglicana, to distinguish it from the remainder, Gower Wallicana, where Welsh traditions and people survived.
Today Gower is an agricultural area, with dairying and, in places, market gardening. It is officially designated an area of outstanding natural beauty, and tourism has become increasingly important. The eastern section has become part of the Swansea metropolitan area.
