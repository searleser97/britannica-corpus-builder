Heron Island,  coral formation of the Capricorn Group, in the southern Great Barrier Reef, in the Coral Sea, off the east coast of Queensland, Australia. The island, with an area of 42 acres (17 hectares), is thickly wooded, though tourism has led to some erosion, and it lies within a lagoon 12 square miles (31 square km) in area. It is part of Capricornia Marine Park and is a wildlife sanctuary, accessible by launch from Gladstone, 48 miles (77 km) southwest. A major attraction is the Marine Biological Station and Aquarium. During the 1920s, Heron supported a sea-turtle industry, but turtle catching is now illegal.
