 Valleys are elongate depressions of Earthâ€™s surface. Valleys are most commonly drained by rivers and may occur in a relatively flat plain or between ranges of hills or mountains. Those valleys produced by tectonic action are called rift valleys. Very narrow, deep valleys of similar appearance are called gorges. Both of those latter types are commonly cut in flat-lying strata but may occur in other geological situations. This is a list of valleys, ordered alphabetically by country.
