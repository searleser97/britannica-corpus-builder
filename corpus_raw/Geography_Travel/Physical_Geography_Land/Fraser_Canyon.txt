Fraser Canyon,   deep chasm cut by the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, between Lytton and Yale. The river there flows through wild, rugged, spectacular scenery, including mountains rising more than 3,000 ft (914 m). Hellâ€™s Gate is in this section of the river. As part of a transportation improvement program since 1955, the Alexandra North Arch was constructed in Fraser Canyon. North of Hope, the canyon has seven highway tunnels, up to 2,000 feet (610 m) long, cut through solid rock.
