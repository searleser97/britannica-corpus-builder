Vale of Glendalough, Irish Gleann Dá Loch (Glen of the Two Lakes),  valley, County Wicklow, Ireland. When St. Kevin settled there in the 6th century, Glendalough became an important monastic centre and, until 1214, the centre of a diocese. The series of churches in the valley, all in ruins except for the small church known as St. Kevin’s Kitchen, date from the 11th and 12th centuries. The original monks settled in a wild and desolate place but one of great beauty. The valley has two lakes and limited farmland. Extensive areas on the valley sides are covered with natural and plantation woodlands.
