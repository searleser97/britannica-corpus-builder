San Salvador Island, also called Watlings Island,  one of the islands of The Bahamas, in the West Indies.
San Salvador is believed by many scholars to be the island of Guanahani, where Christopher Columbus made his first landing in the New World on October 12, 1492. Some scholars assert, however, that the island of Guanahani is actually Samana Cay, 65 miles (105 km) southeast of San Salvador.  San Salvador is about 13 miles (21 km) long and 5 miles (8 km) wide. Its alternate name, Watlings Island, comes from the name of a famous buccaneer. Area 63 square miles (163 square km). Pop. (2000) 970; (2010) 940.
