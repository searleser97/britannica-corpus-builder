Aran Islands, Irish Oileáin Árainn,  three limestone islands—Inishmore, Inishmaan, and Inisheer—comprising 18 square miles (47 square km) and lying across the mouth of Galway Bay on the west coast of Ireland. They are administratively part of County Galway. The islands, whose sheer cliffs face the Atlantic Ocean, are generally bleak. Ships and ferries call mainly at the town of Kilronan on Inishmore, the largest island. The other two islands were long accessible only by currach, a primitive type of boat. The people, who speak Irish, farm and fish under very difficult conditions. The Aran Islands are made up of horizontal sheets of Carboniferous limestone and do not have naturally occurring topsoil. The inhabitants raise crops of oats and potatoes on soil that they have made using seaweed, sand, and manure. Some cattle are raised, and subsistence fishing is carried on. Tourism provides a significant source of income, with visitors attracted by the islands’ austere charm and the impressive remains of prehistoric and early Christian hill forts. Two local Irish clans, the O’Briens and the O’Flahertys, ruled the islands until an English military garrison was built on Inishmore in the late 16th century.
Aspects of the islanders’ life formed the basis of the play Riders to the Sea (1904) and the book of impressions The Aran Islands (1907) by John Millington Synge. Man of Aran, a documentary film (1934) by Robert Flaherty, also depicted island life. The author Liam O’Flaherty was a native of Gort na gCapall, Inishmore.
