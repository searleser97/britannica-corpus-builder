Mexico Basin,   triangular-shaped ocean area covering a large portion of the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. The basin lies northwest of the Campeche Bank, approximately between 22째 and 26째 N and 89째 and 95째 W. Depths range beyond 11,000 feet (3,400 m) in much of the area, with Sigsbee Deep (17,070 feet [5,203 m]) being the deepest point. In the middle of the basin, the Sigsbee Knolls form a series of hills that are believed to be reflections of underlying salt domes rising above the generally flat basin floor.
