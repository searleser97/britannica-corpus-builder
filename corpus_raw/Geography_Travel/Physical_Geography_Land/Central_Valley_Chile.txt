Central Valley, Spanish Valle Central,  geological depression in central Chile between the Western Cordillera of the Andes and the coastal range, extending for about 400 miles (650 km) from the Chacabuco Range in the north to the Biobío River in the south. The valley is the agricultural heartland of Chile and consists of a 40- to 45-mile- (64- to 72-km-) wide plain made up of a vast thickness of heavily mineralized alluvial soils deposited by the region’s principal rivers, the Maipo, Rapel, Cachapoal, Teno, Maule, Itata, and Ñuble. This central section of Chile enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with the cool, dry summers and mild, rainy winters characteristic of the western coasts of all the continents between 30° and 40°  latitude. Vegetation varies with altitude: near sea level Solanum maritimum, a relative of the potato, is common; up to 2,500 feet (760 metres) characteristic plants include a treelike lily (Crinodendron patagua), Bellota miersii, and low trees such as Acacia. The original dry forest, however, has gradually succumbed to urban and agricultural encroachment.
The valley was the original focus of Spanish colonization beginning in the mid-1500s. It continues to be the home of the majority of Chileans and is the predominant agricultural region of the country, containing 40 percent of all its cultivated land, and the main wine-producing regions of the country are found in the valley. Santiago, the capital and cultural centre of the nation, is situated at the northern end of the valley. Four other significant urban centres—Rancagua, Talca, Chillán, and Temuco—are located to Santiago’s south along a longitudinal railroad constructed midway between the Andes and the coastal range; each city is a centre of settlement of Chile’s rich agricultural hinterlands outside Santiago. A section of the Chilean portion of the Pan-American Highway runs southward through the valley from Santiago, and air service connects all major centres.
