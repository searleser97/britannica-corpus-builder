Cynoscephalae,   (Greek: “Dogs’ Heads”), ancient range of hills in Thessaly, Greece, 7 miles (11 km) west of modern Vólos. It was the site of the victory (197 bc) that ended the Second Macedonian War when the Romans under Titus Quinctius Flamininus defeated Philip V of Macedon. The combat engaged about 26,000 men on each side. The outcome hung in the balance, each side prevailing on its own right wing, until a detachment led by an unknown Roman tribune cut through the flank and rear of the Macedonian right. Philip fled, leaving 8,000 dead and 5,000 captured. An earlier, less-celebrated battle that was fought there resulted in the triumph of the Theban general Pelopidas over Alexander, tyrant of Pherae, in 364 bc.
