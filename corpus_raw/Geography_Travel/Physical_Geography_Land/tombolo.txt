Tombolo,   one or more sandbars or spits that connect an island to the mainland. A single tombolo may connect a tied island to the mainland, as at Marblehead, Mass. A double tombolo encloses a lagoon that eventually fills with sediment; fine examples of these occur off the coast of Italy. The shallower waters that occur between an island and the mainland are the loci of such features because sandbars form there.
Adam’s Bridge, which connected Sri Lanka (Ceylon) with India across the 33-mile (53-kilometre) wide Palk Strait, was formerly the world’s largest tombolo. It was destroyed several thousand years ago by a slight change in mean sea level, and only a chain of sandbanks that seriously hinder navigation exists there today.
