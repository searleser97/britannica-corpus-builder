Malaita, also called Mala,  volcanic island in the country of Solomon Islands, southwestern Pacific Ocean. It lies 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Guadalcanal across Indispensable Strait. The island is about 115 miles (185 km) long and 22 miles (35 km) across at its widest point. It is densely forested and mountainous, rising to an elevation of 4,718 feet (1,438 metres) at Mount Ire (Kolourat, or Mount Kolovrat) in the centre. It is separated from the island of Maramasike at its southeastern end by a channel only 1,300 feet (400 metres) wide.
The development of sugar plantations in Fiji and in Queensland, Austl., in the mid-19th century led to a need for workers and the sometimes brutal recruitment of the Melanesian inhabitants of Malaita, provoking reprisals by the islanders and the establishment of a British protectorate in 1893. After World War II a strongly anti-European movement known as “Marching Rule” came into being and aimed to dominate local affairs. A rapprochement in the 1950s between the government and the movement’s leaders culminated in the formation of an organized local council for the first time. After Solomon independence (1978), many Malaitans rose to positions of prominence in the country. Despite comprising less than one-third of the national population, Malaitans hold many of the country’s top business and governmental posts, a situation that in the late 20th and early 21st centuries led to rising tensions and violent clashes with other ethnic groups, including a coup in 2000.
The population engages in copra production, the cultivation of rice and cacao (the source of cocoa), and boatbuilding. There are airstrips at Auki and Asimana on the west coast and another on Maramasike.
