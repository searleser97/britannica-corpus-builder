The islands are generally mountainous with rugged coastlines. Major occupations are sheep and cattle breeding and the processing and exporting of muttonbird oil and carcasses. Whitemark, on Flinders Island, is the largest town. The islands were sighted by Tobias Furneaux of HMS Adventure in 1773 and were surveyed in 1798 by Matthew Flinders.
