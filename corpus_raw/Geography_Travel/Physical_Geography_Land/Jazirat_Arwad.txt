Jazīrat Arwād, Greek Arados, Phoenician Arvad,  island in the eastern Mediterranean off the Syrian coastal town of Ṭarṭūs. Originally settled by the Phoenicians in the early 2nd millennium bc, it formed an excellent base for their commercial operations, into both the Orontes Valley and the hinterland as far as the Euphrates, and also to Egypt. Arwadian soldiers fought against the Egyptians at the Battle of Kadesh (c. 1299 bc). From 1100 to 625 it was under Assyrian rule, passing to the Babylonians in 604 and to the Persians in 539. Its fleet fought against the Greeks at the Battle of Salamis in 480. It was not until Roman times that the island declined, losing its commercial power to Antaradus (Ṭarṭūs). In the 12th–13th century ad, the island was occupied and defended by the Templars. It finally fell to the Arabs, who razed the walls, in 1302. There is a Templar castle and an Arab castle, both dating from the 13th century, still to be seen on Arwād, which today is an entirely Arab island dependent for its livelihood on the fishing industry. Arwād can be reached by boat from Ṭarṭūs.
