Haanja,   morainal region of southeastern Estonia. The moraine is steep on the north but slopes more gently toward the south, extending slightly into Latvia. Deeply incised valleys separate the hills, and there are many lakes. Haanja is the highest and most irregular part of Estonia. It reaches an elevation of 1,042 feet (318 m) at Mount Muna, the highest point in the republic; other high points are Mount VÃ¤lla (976 feet [297 m]) and Mount Kerekunna (971 feet [296 m]). The natural vegetation of the region is field and meadow. Haanja is now covered with woods and farms, and flax is an important traditional crop. Gypsum deposits are present at the southeastern edge of the moraine.
