Nizhegorod, in full Nizhegorodskaya Oblast, formerly (1932–90) Gorky, also called Nizhny Novgorod,  oblast (region) in western Russia, in the middle of the Volga River basin. Nizhegorod oblast is bisected by the Volga River. The northern half of the oblast is a low plain, mostly in dense coniferous forest of spruce, pine, and fir, while lower parts are often swampy. Its soils are infertile. The southern half comprises rolling morainic hills, with deciduous trees, especially oaks, and open areas of forest-steppe. It has gray forest soils.
The highly industrialized area along the Volga and lower Oka rivers includes the metropolis of Nizhny Novgorod, the administrative headquarters, and its satellite towns, producing a great range of goods. Elsewhere there are only pockets of industry, e.g., steel mills in Kulebaki and Vyksa. In the forested areas timber industries are highly developed. At Zavolzhye, above Nizhny Novgorod, is a hydroelectric station on the Volga. The main agricultural area lies south of the Volga; grains—rye, oats, spring wheat, and buckwheat—are dominant, though potatoes and flax are important as well. Area 28,900 square miles (74,800 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) 3,359,816.
