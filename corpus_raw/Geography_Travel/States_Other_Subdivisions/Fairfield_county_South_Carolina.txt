Fairfield,  county, central South Carolina, U.S., consisting of a hilly piedmont region. The Broad River forms the western boundary, and the Wateree River and Wateree Lake form part of the eastern boundary. Monticello Reservoir, Lake Wateree State Park, and the eastern portion of Sumter National Forest lie within Fairfield county.
In the mid-18th century the area’s favourable climate and the expanse of available lands attracted settlers from mid-Atlantic coastal colonies and from Carolina lowlands. When British troops occupied the area in 1780 during the U.S. War of Independence, Lord Cornwallis, the British general, allegedly remarked on its “fair fields,” hence the county’s name; it was organized in 1785. In 1865 Union forces led by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman raided the region and partially destroyed the county seat, Winnsboro. Formerly a leading cotton-growing region, it fell victim to the boll weevil infestation of the 1920s. With the abandonment of cotton-based agriculture, most of its terrain subsequently became covered with forests, of which pine is most common.
By the late 20th century, agriculture was of lesser importance to the economy, surpassed by the logging and lumber industry and the manufacture of truck and bus bodies and textile products. Area 686 square miles (1,778 square km). Pop. (2000) 23,388; (2010) 23,956.
