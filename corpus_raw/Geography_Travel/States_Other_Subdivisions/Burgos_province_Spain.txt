Burgos,  provincia (province) in the Castile-León comunidad autónoma (autonomous community), north-central Spain. It was created in 1833. Burgos province also includes the enclave of Treviño, which is administratively part of Álava province. Burgos is crossed by the Ebro River in the north and the Duero River in the south, neither of which is navigable. Burgos is one of the great forested provinces of Spain, with pine, oak, and beech areas under state management.
The province’s wide ranges of almost uninhabited upland serve as pasture for flocks of sheep. Lambs are exported to Bilbao and Madrid, and pigs are also raised. The cultivation of wheat, barley, and other cereals, however, is the main agricultural activity, and the central and southern portions of the province form part of Spain’s best granary. The Duero and Arlanza valleys produce vegetables and grapes for winemaking and are agriculturally important because of their relatively equable climate and irrigation works. Soft coal (used for briquettes), mica, china clay, and salt are obtained in small quantities, and there are oil fields, though these are mostly exhausted, at Ayoluengo, northwest of Burgos city, the provincial capital. A major nuclear power plant was opened at Garoña in 1971. Aside from food processing, the industries of the province are on a small scale. The traditional woolen, linen, and hemp manufactures survive in small factories and as cottage industries. The most important urban centre is Burgos city, but modern developments have expanded Miranda de Ebro and Aranda de Duero. Area 5,518 square miles (14,291 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 365,972.
