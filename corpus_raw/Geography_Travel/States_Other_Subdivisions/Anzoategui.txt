Anzoátegui,  estado (state), northeastern Venezuela. It is bounded to the north by the Caribbean Sea and Sucre state, to the east by Monagas state, to the south by the Orinoco River, to the west by Guárico state, and to the northwest by Miranda state. Most of Anzoátegui’s area lies in the Llanos (plains). The coastal range tapers off to form the Barcelona Gap near the state capital, Barcelona, a cattle- and coffee-shipping centre on the Neverí River.
Petroleum was discovered about 1930, and by the late 20th century Anzoátegui produced about one-tenth of Venezuela’s oil. The Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt is the site of extensive oil exploration. Pipelines transport natural gas to Caracas, Maracay, Valencia, and Puerto La Cruz, and coal is mined at Naricual.
Cattle raising has been important in the locality for generations, and agriculture, which experienced a long period of stagnation during the development of the oil industry, is again one of the most dynamic components of the region’s economy. The principal products include corn, coffee, cacao, cotton, peanuts, sweet potatoes, sorghum, and sugarcane. Manufacturing has become important in the Barcelona–Guanta–Puerto La Cruz complex. The state’s highway network is extensive. Area 16,700 square miles (43,300 square km). Pop. (2001) 1,222,225; (2011) 1,469,747.
