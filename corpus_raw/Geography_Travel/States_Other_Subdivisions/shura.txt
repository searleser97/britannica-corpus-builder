Shūrā, (Arabic:  “consultation”)  in early Islamic history, the board of electors that was constituted by the second caliph (ruler of the Muslim community), ʿUmar I (634–644), to elect his successor. Thereafter, in Muslim states, the term shūrā variously designated a council of state, or advisers to the sovereign (as in Saudi Arabia), a parliament (as in Pakistan), and a court of law with jurisdiction over claims made by citizens and public officials against the government (as in Afghanistan). The word shūrā provides the title of the 42nd surah of the Qurʾān, in which believers are exhorted to conduct their affairs “by mutual consultation.”
