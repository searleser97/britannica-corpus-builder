Molise,  regione, southeast-central Italy. It consists of the provinces of Campobasso and Isernia and was created in 1965 from the southern portion of the former region of Abruzzi e Molise. The region’s western sector is part of the mountainous Apennines; it is drained by the Volturno River westward to the Tyrrhenian Sea. The rest of Molise consists mostly of low mountains and hills, with a narrow strip of lowlands along the Adriatic coast; 90 percent of the region is considered upland. Central and eastern Molise are drained by the Biferno River to the Adriatic Sea.
One of the nation’s most rural regions, Molise is unique in showing virtually no change in population during the first century of existence of the Italian state; from 1861 to 1961 its population increased approximately 1 percent, mainly because the growth rate was offset by constant emigration, mostly to other regions within Italy. Wheat and potatoes are the principal crops, and livestock raising (pigs, sheep, goats, cattle) is extensive. Industrial development is slight, though there are small plants associated with the food and garment industries. Campobasso, the regional capital, is the only city of any size. The history of Molise is closely connected with that of neighbouring Abruzzi. Area 1,713 square miles (4,438 square km). Pop. (2006 est.) 320,907.
