Sovereign Council,   governmental body established by France in April 1663 for administering New France, its colony centred in what is now the St. Lawrence Valley of Canada.
The council’s power included the naming of judges and minor officials, control of public funds and commerce with France, regulation of the fur trade with the Indians, and the right to issue policy decrees on colonial affairs. The powers of the council, however, were not absolute. It could order military expenditures, for example, only with the authority of the governor; moreover, its decisions were subject to the governor’s veto. As originally established, the council consisted of the governor, the bishop (or, in his absence, the senior ecclesiastic), five councillors, an attorney general, and a clerk. The governor and the bishop, acting “jointly and in agreement,” appointed the other members, who, at the end of a year, could be changed or continued in office.
In 1664 some of the council’s powers were transferred to the Company of the West Indies; that company, however, did not exercise them fully, and the council continued to be the dominant force in the colony. The company was permitted to name the council members, but it did not do so until 1674, a year before its own dissolution.
In June 1675 a royal edict increased the number of councillors to seven, with vacancies to be filled by the king. After 1685 the intendant, a French administrative official, gradually took over many of the council’s functions. In 1702 the Sovereign Council was renamed the Superior Council.
