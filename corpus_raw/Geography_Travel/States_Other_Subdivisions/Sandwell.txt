Sandwell,  metropolitan borough, metropolitan county of West Midlands, west-central England. It consists of several urban industrial communities just west of the city of Birmingham. Most of the borough—including Wednesbury, West Bromwich, Cradley Heath, Smethwick, and Hamstead—belongs to the historic county of Staffordshire, but Oldbury (the main administrative centre) and southern neighbourhoods such as Warley lie in the historic county of Worcestershire.
Metalworking, especially nail making, in the area dates from the Middle Ages, and coal was mined in the 13th century. Sandwell’s main industrial growth, based on local coal and ironstone reserves, followed the coming of the canals in the 18th century. Ironworks were established, including the famous Soho Manufactory (1761) at Smethwick, which was associated with the engineers James Watt and Matthew Boulton. Today Sandwell is an important centre of engineering and iron foundries, producing a wide range of metal products. Chemicals and glassmaking are also important industries. Two motorways converge in the borough. Area 33 square miles (86 square km). Pop. (2001) 282,904; (2011) 308,063.
