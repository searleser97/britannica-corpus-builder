East Devon,  district, administrative and historic county of Devon, southwestern England. It is located in the southeastern part of the county bordering Lyme Bay of the English Channel to the south. Sidmouth is the administrative centre.
East Devon is historically known for its handmade lace and carpet-making industries in the eastern interior market towns of Honiton and Axminster. High-quality limestone has been quarried near the central coastal town of Beer for centuries; it was used for the finer carvings and pillars in many of Devonâ€™s medieval, Tudor, and Jacobean buildings. Modern East Devon is also known for its popular cliffside resorts, especially in the southwest at Exmouth and Sidmouth, and for its intensively cultivated fruits (particularly apples) and early-season vegetables grown on the fertile red soils of the lower Exer, Clyst, and Otter river valleys in the western part of the district. Dairying is also economically important.
Cliffs of red sandstone and white chalk, some 400 feet (120 metres) high along most of the seacoast, and the hilly wooded area immediately inland (especially to the east) constitute an area of outstanding beauty and are so designated by the government. The coastal areas, along with those in neighbouring Dorset county, were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2001.
Bronze Age barrows (burial mounds) are commonplace in the hills south of Honiton and near the village of Dalwood. East of Honiton is the Loughwood Meeting House, an excellent example of a mid-17th-century English Baptist chapel with an unaltered interior. Area 315 square miles (815 square km). Pop. (2001) 125,520; (2011) 132,457; (2018 est.) 144,317.
