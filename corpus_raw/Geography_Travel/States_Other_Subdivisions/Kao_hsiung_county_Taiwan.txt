Kao-hsiung, Pinyin Gaoxiong,  former county (hsien, or xian), southwestern Taiwan. Since 2010 it has been incorporated administratively into the Kao-hsiung special municipality.
The enlarged special municipality is bordered by T’ai-nan (Tainan) special municipality and Chia-i (Jiayi) county to the north, T’ai-tung (Taidong) and Hua-lien (Hualian) counties to the east, P’ing-tung (Pingdong) county to the south, and the Taiwan Strait to the west. Central Kao-hsiung and its major international port with a large dry dock are situated in the western-coastal region of the special municipality. The Yü (Yu) Mountains, extending over most of the northern part, give rise to the Ch’i-shan (Qishan) and Lao-nung (Laonong) rivers and merge gradually with the fertile coastal plains in the south. Mount Yü—also called Mount Hsin-kao (Xingao), formerly Mount Morrison—is Taiwan’s highest peak,13,114 feet (3,997 metres) above sea level.
Rice, sugarcane, tobacco, bananas, and pineapples are grown in the special municipality. The city district of Mei-nung (Meinong), known as the “tobacco kingdom,” has a large area of farmland devoted to raising tobacco. One of the chief industrial regions of Taiwan, Kao-hsiung produces cement, aluminum, paper, fertilizer, plywood, and small machinery; shipbuilding and oil refining are also important. Fo-kuan (Foguan) Hill in Hsin-tien (Xindian) has one of the largest Buddhist temples in East Asia. Ta-pei (Dabei), or Ch’eng-ch’ing (Chengqing), Lake, the tomb of King Ning-ching (Ningjing), and the Ch’un-ch’iu (Chunqiu; Spring and Autumn) Pagodas are major tourist attractions. Feng-shan (Fengshan), administrative seat of the former county, is linked by railway to Chi-lung (Jilong, or Keelung) in northeastern Taiwan.
