Carrick,  former district, Cornwall unitary authority, England, encompassing a band 15 miles (24 km) wide, from the north to the south coast, across the centre of the Cornish peninsula. Dominated by flat plateau surfaces, reaching 500 feet (150 metres) in places, and incised by rivers, the former district of Carrick has fertile farmland and a rural landscapeâ€”in contrast to the area of Redruth-Camborne to the west, scarred by past mining, and the St. Austell region to the east, with its vast pits and spoil heaps of the china clay industry. Evidence of mining penetrates into northwestern Carrick, however, with tin production near Chacewater. Located in Carrick are the county town, Truro, and a major port, Falmouth.
The annual rainfall is normally between 40 and 50 inches (1,000 and 1,250 mm), which, together with mild winters, has encouraged mixed farming with an emphasis on dairying; some cattle and sheep are fattened. Barley is the major feed crop. On the protected west side of the Fal estuary, some fruit, early potatoes, and a variety of vegetables are grown. Hamlets and isolated farms are found on the plateau. Rock outcroppings on both the north and south coasts produce a spectacular shoreline with cliffs, headlands, and sandy bays. On the north coast are three miles of sand dunes between Perranporth and Holywell. Tourism has helped the expansion of such villages as Perranporth, St. Agnes, and St. Mawes.
Truro is the focus for both ridge and valley routes and is an important administrative, distribution, and service centre. The mouth of the River Fal and its tributaries has been submerged by a rise in sea level to form a deepwater inlet with several branches. The main inlet is Carrick Roads, and Falmouth is located on a peninsula on the western side of its entrance. Penryn is located at the head of navigation on an arm of Carrick Roads. Area 178 square miles (461 square km).
