It is bounded by the provinces of Cantabria to the north, Burgos to the east, Valladolid to the south and west, and León to the west. It was formed in 1833.

The remainder of Palencia, the fertile Campos Plain, belongs to the great Castilian tableland. The principal rivers are the Pisuerga and Carrión. Minerals have been found in the mountains, but only coal and small quantities of copper are mined. The Castilla Canal (built 1753–1832), on which the provincial capital, Palencia city, is located, connects the province with Valladolid and is used for irrigation as well as transport.
