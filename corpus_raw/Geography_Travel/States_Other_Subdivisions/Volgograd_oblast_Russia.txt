Volgograd, formerly (until 1961) Stalingrad,  oblast (region), southwestern Russia, lying athwart the lower Volga and Don rivers. The Volga is flanked on the west by the Volga Upland, which is continued south of Volgograd as the Yergeni Upland. West of the Khoper and Don are additional low uplands. Between the uplands and also east of the Volga are level plains. Most of the oblast lies in a dry steppe zone of grass and some sage on fertile soils, but almost all has been plowed, causing severe soil erosion and gullying, especially on the uplands. Saline soils are common, particularly in the Trans-Volga and the south.
Once an area inhabited by successive nomadic peoples (Bulgars, Khazars, and Tatars), the region was settled by Russians from the mid-16th century. Much of the far northern part of the oblast along the Volga River was once part of the Volga-German A.S.S.R. until it was dissolved in 1941 and the Germans deported to other areas of the Soviet Union. The bulk of the population today lives along the rivers and in the northern lowland. Industry is concentrated largely in Volgograd, the administrative centre; the other cities are concerned chiefly with processing agricultural products. Petroleum is extracted in the north around Zhirnovsk and natural gas near Kotovo and Frolovo. Agriculture is of great importance, but it suffers severely from droughts and soil erosion; irrigation is increasing steadily in many areas. The main crops are wheat, millet, corn (maize), sunflowers, and mustard. Along the Volga Upland, market gardening and dairying are well developed. In the south and in the Trans-Volga, cattle and sheep raising is important. Area 43,980 square miles (113,900 square km). Pop. (2006 est.) 2,635,640.
