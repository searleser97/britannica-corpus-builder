Colfax county has a colourful history. The region was Apache Indian territory for several centuries before the Santa Fe Trail opened in 1821. The cowboy town of Cimarron became a major stop on the trail; gambling, prostitution, and the presence of frontier outlaws gave the town a reputation for vice and violence. The county was established in 1869 and was named for Schuyler Colfax, then U.S. vice president. The county seat is Raton. Cattle ranching, tourism and recreation, lumbering, and banking are major elements in the economy. Area 3,757 square miles (9,730 square km). Pop. (2000) 14,189; (2010) 13,750.
