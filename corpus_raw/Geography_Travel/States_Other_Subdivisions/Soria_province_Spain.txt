Soria,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Castile-León, north-central Spain. It was formed from part of the historic region of Old Castile in 1833.

Food processing and services, the province’s dominant economic activities, are concentrated in the provincial capital. Area 3,979 square miles (10,306 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 93,593.
