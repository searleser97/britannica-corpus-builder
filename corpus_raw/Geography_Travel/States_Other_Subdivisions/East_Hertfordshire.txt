East Hertfordshire,  district, administrative and historic county of Hertfordshire, southeastern England, at the northern edge of the Greater London Green Belt. Hertford is the administrative seat for the county of Hertfordshire but shares district administration with Bishop’s Stortford.
The landscape is largely undulating and rural, characterized by medieval manor houses and thatched cottages. The River Lea, navigable to barge traffic from its outlet in the Thames in east-central London northward to the town of Hertford, drains the southwestern part of the district, and the River Stort forms the southeastern boundary before joining the Lea at the district’s southern tip. Cereals are cultivated in the fertile northern and central parts, where the soil consists of unstratified glacial drift. Farther south the less-fertile heavy clays are used primarily as grazing land for dairy cows. Extensive residential development has occurred along the district’s southern edge in towns such as Hertford, Ware, Hoddesdon, and Bishop’s Stortford, which lie within commuting distance of London and its periphery.
The first English canal, the New River aqueduct, 23 miles (40 km) long—was built in 1613—to bring water from springs southeast of Ware southward to sites in what is now northern Greater London to augment London’s water supply; it is still in use, even though the Ware vicinity is no longer the source of the water.
Malt breweries utilizing locally grown cereals are located in Ware, Bishop’s Stortford, and Sawbridgeworth. Other industries in the district include brush making, printing, and light manufacturing. The Rhodes Memorial Museum (founded 1938) at Bishop’s Stortford commemorates the life of Cecil Rhodes, the empire builder of British South Africa. Area 184 square miles (476 square km). Pop. (2001) 128,919; (2011) 137,687.
