Sūhāj, also spelled Sawhāj or Sohag,  muḥāfaẓah (governorate) in Upper Egypt, south of Asyūṭ and north of Qinā governorates. It is a ribbonlike stretch of the fertile Nile River valley about 60 miles (100 km) long. Through it the Nile flows in a roughly 13-mile- (21-km-) wide flat-bottomed valley hemmed in by limestone cliffs rising to nearly 1,000 feet (305 metres). Throughout the area, the Nile has cut a channel close to the eastern side of the valley. Nearly all of the arable land lies west of the river. Sūhāj governorate’s habitable area is one of the most densely populated in Egypt.
About three-fourths of the employed population are farmers. The principal crops are cotton, millet, wheat, sugarcane, onions, peanuts (groundnuts), and melons. Local provincial industries include silk weaving at Akhmīm. Perennially irrigated land is watered from Al-Sūhājiyyah Canal, fed from the Najʿ Ḥammādī barrage to the south. At Mount Al-Ḥarīdī and Al-ʿĪsāwiyyah Sharq east of Akhmīm, there are limestone quarries.
Two notable sites of antiquity are Abydos, with monuments of Old, Middle, and New Kingdom Egypt; and Bayt Khallāf, near Sūhāj town, the site of a mastaba (mud-brick tomb) probably of King Djoser (3rd dynasty; c. 2650–c. 2575 bce). Nearby is the Coptic White Convent with a late 5th-century basilica church surrounded by a wall of white calcite incorporating many reused pharaonic stones. The Red Convent, also with a basilica church, is located 4 miles (6.5 km) to the northwest. Both of these centres of early and medieval Coptic learning have been restored.
Apart from Sūhāj, the capital of the governorate, principal towns are Akhmīm, Jirjā, and Ṭaḥtā. Jirjā has a sugar refinery, which was enlarged in the early 1980s. Area 597 square miles (1,547 square km). Pop. (2006) 3,746,377.
