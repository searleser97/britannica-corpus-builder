Asyūṭ, also spelled Asiut, or Assiout,  muḥāfaẓah (governorate) of Upper Egypt. It lies along the Nile River, between Al-Minyā governorate to the north and Sawhāj governorate to the south. Its settled area, which is limited to the river valley, extends almost 100 miles (160 km) along the river and is about 12 miles (19 km) wide. The governorate extends into the Western Desert, with Al-Wādī al-Jadīd governorate on its western boundary.
Asyūṭ’s history dates to the Badarian prehistoric period, named for the site of Al-Bādāri, where the remains of that predynastic cultural phase were first excavated. The region was a battleground between the 10th and 11th dynasties in the First Intermediate Period (c. 2130–1939 bc). Egypt’s southern frontier lay at Cusae in Asyūṭ during the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1630–1540 bc). Akhenaton (reigned 1353–36 bc) moved his residence to the site of Tell al-Amarna, on the eastern bank of the Nile 50 miles (80 km) downriver from Syut (modern Asyūṭ city).
Agriculture is the main activity of the governorate; cotton, grains, vegetables, and lentils are the major crops, and chickens are raised. There are no major towns outside the governorate’s capital, Asyūṭ (q.v.). The Al-Ibrāhīmīyah Canal, branching off the Nile just north of Asyūṭ city, flows in an old river channel on the western side of the valley and irrigates the agricultural land. Copts constitute a considerable part of the population of the governorate. Area 600 square miles (1,553 square km). Pop. (2006) 3,441,597.
