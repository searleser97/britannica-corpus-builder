East Renfrewshire,  council area, west-central Scotland, just southwest of the city of Glasgow. It forms a part of the historic county of Renfrewshire and covers an area of upland farming country in the south and west, rising to an elevation of 1,230 feet (375 metres) in the extreme south. Dairy farming, hog raising, and vegetable cultivation are the main agricultural activities. The urbanized northern area developed during rapid expansion of the cotton textile industry in the early 19th century. The subsequent decline of this industry and the development of an efficient transport system have changed the area, including the towns of Barrhead, Thorniebank, Busby, and Newton Mearns, into a suburban appendage of Glasgow. Giffnock is the administrative centre. Area 67 square miles (174 square km). Pop. (2001) 89,311; (2011) 90,574.
