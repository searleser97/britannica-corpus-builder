Anambra,  state, east-central Nigeria. Anambra state was first formed in 1976 from the northern half of East-Central state, and in 1991 it was considerably reduced in area by an administrative reorganization that created the new state of Enugu.
Anambra is bounded by the states of Kogi on the north, Enugu on the east, Abia on the southeast, Imo and Rivers on the south, and Delta and Edo on the west. It includes the valley of the lower Anambra River, which is a tributary of the Niger River. The northern part of the state consists of open grassland with occasional woodlands and clusters of oil palm trees. The southern part includes a tropical rainforest along the eastern bank of the Niger River, which forms Anambra’s western boundary.
Igbo constitute the majority of the population. Agriculture plays an important role in the state’s economy; yams, taro, oil palm products, rice, corn (maize), cassava (manioc), and citrus fruits are the principal crops. A large modern market is located in Onitsha, which is the hub of the state’s commerce and industry. Awka is the state capital. A major bridge across the Niger River at Onitsha provides a direct road link westward to Benin City and Lagos. Lead, zinc, and lignite are mined in the southern part of the state, and petroleum and natural gas are also extracted. Industries include textile manufacturing, soft-drink bottling, brewing, and furniture manufacture. Metalworking and wood carving are traditional local crafts. A network of roads connects Awka with Onitsha, Enugu, and Ihiala. Pop. (2006) 4,182,032.
