Rushcliffe,  borough (district), administrative and historic county of Nottinghamshire, central England, immediately southeast of the city of Nottingham. Rushcliffe is a rural agricultural area of open rolling uplands (wolds) and flat plains. The wolds in the south rise to between 200 and 300 feet (60 and 90 metres) in elevation and are an extension of higher areas in the adjacent county of Leicestershire. The valley of the River Trent forms most of the borough’s northern boundary, and the Vale of Belvoir is in the northeast; both of these wide flat plains extend far beyond the borough’s boundaries.
West Bridgford, a light industrial centre directly across the River Trent from the city of Nottingham, is also the administrative centre of both the county and the borough. A  coal mine operated at Cotgrave in the centre of the borough from the 1960s to the early ’90s. There is a large thermal power station located in the southwest. The Trent Bridge Cricket Ground at West Bridgford, one of the better-known cricket grounds in Great Britain, is a venue for test (international) matches. City Ground, also located at West Bridgford, is the home of the Nottingham Forest Football Club. The Perpendicular Gothic broach steeple of the All Saints Church at Bingham, in the Trent valley northeast of West Bridgford, is noteworthy for its breadth and for its many buttresses. Area 158 square miles (410 square km). Pop. (2001) 105,599; (2011) 111,129.
