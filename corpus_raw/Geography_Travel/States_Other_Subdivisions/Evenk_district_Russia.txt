Evenk, also called Evenki, Evenki also spelled Evenky,  former autonomous okrug (district), Krasnoyarsk kray (territory) in north-central Russia, on the Central Siberian Plateau. In 2007 it merged with Taymyr autonomous district and Krasnoyarsk; the latter remained the name of the territory. In the northwestern part of Evenk, the Putoran Mountains rise to 5,581 feet (1,701 metres) in Mount Kamen. Apart from higher areas with tundra vegetation, the area is covered by coniferous forest of larch. Permafrost underlies the poor soils. The climate is severe, with long, cold winters. This huge area, which is larger than the U.S. state of Texas, has only a handful of villages and one urban settlement, Tura. The area is inhabited primarily by Russians but also by Evenk, who live by reindeer herding, hunting, and fishing. Usually only the herders move with the reindeer, the bulk of the population having been settled. The timber resources and mineral deposits are scarcely exploited. Travel is by river in summer and by trails and by air in winter. Area 296,400 square miles (767,600 square km). Pop. (2005 est.) 17,400.
