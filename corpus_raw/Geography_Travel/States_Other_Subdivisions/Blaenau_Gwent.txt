Blaenau Gwent,  county borough, southeastern Wales. It covers an area of deep valleys and plateau uplands on the eastern rim of the historic South Wales coalfield. Blaenau Gwent lies almost entirely within the historic county of Monmouthshire, but the community of Brynmawr in the northeast belongs to the historic county of Brecknockshire. The administrative centre is Ebbw Vale.
Blaenau Gwent, traditionally a coal-mining and steel-working region, suffered serious economic decline in the mid-20th century as funds and industry were diverted south to the coastal areas fronting the Bristol Channel. Ebbw Vale, first developed as a coal-mining centre in the 18th century and subsequently turned to steel. In 1935 the faltering steelworks were subsidized by the government in order to retain jobs in the economically depressed area. In 1978, however, the steelworks closed down. The town of Abertillery in southern Blaenau Gwent likewise experienced the growth and collapse of the coal trade, with its last active deep mine closing in 1988. New industries introduced in the area include the manufacture of nylon, textiles, electronics, and foodstuffs. Brecon Beacons National Park provides varied recreational opportunities. Area 42 square miles (109 square km). Pop. (2001) 70,064; (2011) 69,800.
