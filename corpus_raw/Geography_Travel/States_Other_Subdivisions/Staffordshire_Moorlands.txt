Staffordshire Moorlands,  district, administrative and historic county of Staffordshire, central England. It is situated directly east of the city of Stoke-on-Trent. Leek is the administrative centre.
Staffordshire Moorlands includes part of Peak District National Park in the northeast, where it is characterized by many bleak gritstone and limestone moorlands. Within the southern extremity of the Pennines, the moorlands extend from northwest to southeast in long ridges separated by deep valleys and decline in elevation from more than 1,600 feet (500 metres) in the north to about 600 feet in the south to form an area of more-fertile, gently rolling terrain.
Staffordshire Moorlandsâ€™ rich resources of fireclays in the Keupermarls of the extreme southwest and coal in the extreme west were exploited between the late 18th and early 20th century. More than a century of coal mining left behind huge heaps of rubble; the fireclay extraction left large and deep pits in the marl subject to flooding. Heightened sensitivity to environmental conservation finally generated efforts in the 1980s to reclaim some of the wastelands. Sheep rough graze the uplands, and dairy farming is commonplace in the southern valleys. The towns in the south and west (including Biddulph, Leek, and Cheadle) manufacture assorted textiles and are local agricultural centres. St. Giles Roman Catholic church in Cheadle is a mid-19th-century Gothic Revival masterpiece built by A.W.N. Pugin. Potholing (exploration of underground caverns) is a popular sport in the limestone moorlands in the southeastern part of the district. Area 222 square miles (576 square km). Pop. (2001) 94,489; (2011) 97,106.
