Córdoba,  provincia (province), central Argentina. From the Grande Mountains in the west, which rise to 9,462 feet (2,884 metres), the land slopes eastward to the great Pampa grasslands, being drained by the Primero, Segundo, Tercero, Cuarto, and Quinto rivers. Only the Tercero reaches the Paraná River; the others terminate in swamps or in the saline Mar Chiquita Lagoon in the northeast. The north-central city of Córdoba is the provincial capital.
Spanish settlements were first established in the area in the 16th century, when trade was carried on with Bolivia and Chile. Although Córdoba was a stubborn region of Spanish resistance to the Latin American war of independence, it joined (1816) the Argentine Confederation, which it later (1852–62) strongly supported against the political dominance of Buenos Aires. Completion of the railway from Rosario in 1869 was the first important transportation link with the east, but Córdoba has retained its provincial loyalties.
Cattle raising, carried over from colonial times, is of great economic importance, as is the cultivation of wheat, corn (maize), and soybeans. Granite and limestone are quarried, and there is mining (tungsten, mica, and beryllium) in the sierras (mountains). The province’s chief industrial centres, which process foods and manufacture textiles, are Córdoba, Río Cuarto, and Villa María. Important tourist resorts in the sierras include Cosquín (site of an annual folklore festival), Villa Carlos Paz, and La Falda. The province has an excellent communications network of roads, railways, and airlines. Area 63,831 square miles (165,321 square km). Pop. (2001) 3,066,801; (2010) 3,308,876.
