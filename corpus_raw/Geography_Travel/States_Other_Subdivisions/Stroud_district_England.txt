Stroud,  town (parish) and district, administrative and historic county of Gloucestershire, south-central England. The district occupies an area in the south-central part of the county between the cities of Bristol to the southwest and Gloucester to the north; it borders the River Severn on the west. Stroud district incorporates a section of the limestone Cotswolds uplands that rise some 600 to 800 feet (180 to 250 metres) on the east and the nearly sea-level fertile clay vales of Berkeley and Gloucester on the west; the steep-faced western escarpment of the Cotswolds separates the two regions.
Between the 14th and the 18th century the Cotswolds were a principal centre of England’s woolen trade. Villages within what is now Stroud district became prosperous by either grazing large numbers of sheep or weaving and dyeing fine woolens. The many old and imposing limestone buildings in the district reflect that early period’s prosperity. Today cattle, rather than sheep, generally graze the Cotswolds’ undulating tableland. The district’s picturesque villages and fields of cereals and corn (maize) interspersed with beech groves are popular with tourists. The western valleys next to the Severn produce milk and some cheese, and apples and pears are grown for cider and perry (fermented pear juice).
Stroud town, the district seat, and adjacent communities have an unusually varied manufacturing base. Products include mining equipment, plastics, electronic apparatuses, pianos, machine-made fine woolens, scarlet dyes, and most of the world’s billiard tablecloths. The town of Berkeley in the River Severn valley has an eerie, well-preserved medieval castle. Berkeley was the birthplace and lifelong home of the surgeon Edward Jenner, who in 1796 discovered the principle of vaccination. Area district, 175 square miles (453 square km). Pop. (2001) town, 12,690; district, 107,898; (2011) town, 13,259; district, 112,779.
