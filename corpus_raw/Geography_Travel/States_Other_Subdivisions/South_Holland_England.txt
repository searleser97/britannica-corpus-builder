South Holland,  district, administrative and historic county of Lincolnshire, east-central England. It occupies an area of reclaimed marshland within the Fens in the southern part of the county. Spalding, an ancient market town and now the administrative centre of the district, is a headquarters for an elaborate drainage and flood-control system in the Fens.
South Holland borders The Wash, a shallow bay of the North Sea, to the northeast. The dry flatlands in the north along The Wash were formed as islands of silt interspersed with marshes when large stretches of silt penned in by glaciers of the Pleistocene Epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) piled up on the shores of a shallow inland sea. Flat plains of peat farther inland were formed as plants decayed on the shallow sea bottom. Throughout the Middle Ages, piecemeal encroachment upon the edges of the silt land took place for agricultural use, but the whole expanse of peat land remained virtually undrained until the mid-17th century.
This extremely fertile area grows fruit trees, cereals (especially wheat and barley), potatoes, and assorted market garden produce. A large bulb-growing area, specializing in tulips, is in the vicinity of Spalding. Other small locales, such as Holbeach, Crowland, Long Sutton, Sutton Bridge, and Donnington, serve as agricultural market centres. Area 286 square miles (742 square km). Pop. (2001) 76,522; (2011) 88,270.
