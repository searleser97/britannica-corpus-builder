Carbon,  county, eastern Pennsylvania, U.S., flanked to the north by the Pocono Mountains and to the south by Blue Mountain and located midway between the cities of Wilkes-Barre and Allentown. It consists of a mountainous region lying largely in the Appalachian Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The principal waterways are the Lehigh River and Tobyhanna, Quakake, Nesquehoning, Mahoning, Lizard, and Aquashicola creeks, as well as Penn Forest and Wild Creek reservoirs. State parks include Hickory Run, Lehigh Gorge, and Beltzville, which surrounds Beltzville Lake. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail follows the ridgeline of Blue Mountain.
Lehighton was laid out on the site of Gnadenhutten, a Moravian settlement dating from 1746 that was destroyed during the French and Indian War. Anthracite coal was discovered in the region as early as 1791, but it was not mined commercially until the early 19th century, with the introduction of canals and railroads to the area—including a gravity-powered railroad that was the first of its kind in the United States (1828). The county was created in 1843 and named for its abundant coal deposits. In 1954 Mauch Chunk merged with East Mauch Chunk to form Jim Thorpe, the county seat, in commemoration of the American Indian athlete; his remains were interred in a nearby mausoleum.
The county’s economy is based on health care services, textile manufacturing, and anthracite coal mining. Area 383 square miles (991 square km). Pop. (2000) 58,802; (2010) 65,249.
