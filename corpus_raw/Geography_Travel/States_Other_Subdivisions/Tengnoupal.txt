Tengnoupal,  village, southern Manipur state, far eastern India. It is located about 40 miles (65 km) south-southeast of Imphal, the state capital, at the highest point of a road between Imphal and northwestern Myanmar (Burma).
Tengnoupal is situated in an upland region in the Manipur Hills in the southeastern part of the state, where the elevation varies from about 2,500 to 10,000 feet (760 to 3,050 metres). The Manipur and Barak rivers flow from north to south through the region (the latter through narrow valleys), and numerous lakes serve as important fisheries. Lake vegetation includes lotus and water lilies, and orchids are found on the plains. Gorals (goatlike mammals), kharshas (wild pigs), tigers, leopards, and greylags (geese) inhabit the forested areas. Agriculture is the basis of the economy; crops (raised in small, scattered plots) include rice, wheat, mustard, potatoes, and pulses (legumes). Mangoes and lemons are also grown. Industries include hand-loom weaving and embroidering (Manipuri saris are known for their durability and fine embroidery), blacksmithing, agricultural implement making, and goldsmithing. Pottery, cane products, soap, and paper are also made. Rock salt, copper, limestone, and iron ore are mined in small quantities.
Pakhangha established a dynasty there in 33 ce that continued until integration with the Indian union in 1947. A manuscript of local literature, written during the reign of King Irengba, dates from 1074. The area was invaded by the Chinese in 1631 and was bombed by the Japanese in 1942 during World War II. Tengnoupalâ€™s surrounding region is populated mostly by different tribal peoples who speak the Tibeto-Burman Manipuri language. Pop. (2001) 1,265; (2011) 2,158.
