Vitsyebsk, in full Vitsyebskaya Voblasts,  voblasts (province), northeastern Belarus. It lies mostly in the broad, shallow basin of the Western Dvina River. To the east and south the land rises in a series of gently undulating uplands. Swamps are extensive in the Western Dvina basin, but most of the province is in mixed forest of pine, spruce, oak, birch, and alder. The uplands have been largely cleared for agriculture, bringing about serious soil erosion. Flax and rye are the main crops, and the raising of dairy and beef cattle and pigs is important. In the south are many orchards. Apart from the principal cities of Vitsyebsk city, Orsha, Polatsk, and Navapolatsk, the towns are small and engaged in timber working and in processing farm produce. Much peat is cut for fueling electric power stations. Area 15,500 square miles (40,100 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) 1,273,300.
