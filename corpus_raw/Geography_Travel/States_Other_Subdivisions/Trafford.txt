Trafford,  metropolitan borough in the southwestern part of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester, northwestern England. Most of the boroughâ€™s area, including towns such as Sale and Altrincham, lies south of the River Mersey in the historic county of Cheshire. However, the historic county of Lancashire encompasses the urban core of the borough north of the Mersey, including Stretford, the Trafford Park Industrial Estate, and Old Trafford, home of both the Lancashire County Cricket Club and the football (soccer) club Manchester United. The administrative centre is at Sale.
The early industrial growth of the borough was stimulated by the building in 1761 of the Bridgewater Canal, which runs north through Trafford Park and southwest through Stretford, Sale, and Altrincham. Development accelerated after 1894 with the completion of the Manchester Ship Canal, which forms the western boundary of the borough. This made Manchester a port and provided the impetus for the development of the Trafford Park Industrial Estate, a centre for manufacturing, engineering, and storage and distribution. Office development is expanding. Parts of the borough near Cheshire have served as residential suburbs for Manchester businesspeople since the 19th century. Area 41 square miles (106 square km). Pop. (2001) 210,145; (2011) 226,578.
