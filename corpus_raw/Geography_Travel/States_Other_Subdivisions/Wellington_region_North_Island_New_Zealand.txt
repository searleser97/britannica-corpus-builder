Wellington,  regional council, extreme southern North Island, New Zealand. It includes the cities of Wellington (the national capital) and Lower Hutt, Upper Hutt, Porirua, and Masterton. The broad Hutt River valley, once the locale of dairy farms and market gardens, has absorbed much of Wellington city’s urban expansion since the 1950s. There is still much open farmland to the north, however.
East of the city of Wellington is the Rimutaka Range and east of that, the Wairarapa Plain. One of the earliest European-settled sections of North Island, Wairarapa (Maori: “Glistening Waters”) was pioneered in the 1840s.
Fruit and vegetable, dairy, sheep, and beef cattle farming predominate. The business and administrative centre of the plain is Masterton, in the north. The western and southern boundaries of Wellington regional council consist of hilly, isolated coastland fronting the South Pacific Ocean. Area 3,143 square miles (8,140 square km). Pop. (2006) 448,959; (2012 est.) 490,100.
