Hillsborough,  county, southern New Hampshire, U.S., bordered to the south by Massachusetts. It is a hilly upland region drained by the Merrimack, Piscataquog, and other rivers and dotted with numerous small lakes, including Franklin Pierce Lake and Powder Mill Pond. Public lands include Clough, Greenfield, Miller, and Silver Lake state parks, as well as Fox, Vincent, and Casalis state forests. Timberland is largely white pine, with stands of maple, birch, beech, spruce, and fir. The county contains several covered truss bridges from the 19th century.
Abenaki Indians of the Penacook Confederacy inhabited the region before European colonists in 1769 established Hillsborough, one of New Hampshire’s original counties. It was named for Wills Hill, earl of Hillsborough. Early industries included soapstone quarrying in Francestown, from 1794, and cotton milling in New Ipswich, from 1803. Notable natives of the county included U.S. President Franklin Pierce, born in Hillsborough in 1804, and newspaper editor Horace Greeley, born in Amherst in 1811.
Hillsborough county is the manufacturing centre of the state because of the industrial cities that line the Merrimack River valley: Manchester, Nashua (the county seat), Merrimack, and Hudson. Amoskeag Falls has long provided hydropower for industry in Manchester, New Hampshire’s largest city. These cities contributed to the county’s status as a leading producer of textile goods before World War II. Since diversified, the economy now depends upon the manufacture of paper products, iron and steel, computer terminals, electrical equipment, and optical instruments. Hillsborough is the most populous county in the state. Area 876 square miles (2,270 square km). Pop. (2000) 382,388; (2010) 400,721.
