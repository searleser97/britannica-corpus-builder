Blackpool,  town and unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Lancashire, England, on the Irish Sea coast. It is one of the largest and most popular resorts in the country.
Blackpool’s growth has been fairly rapid since the late 18th century, when it was transformed from a small hamlet clustered around a “black pool” into a fashionable sea-bathing centre. Its early popularity is ascribed to the British scientific writer William Hutton, who popularized the health-giving properties of seawater. Its proximity to the Lancashire industrial towns and the introduction of fast railway services brought about Blackpool’s rapid 19th-century growth. About 7 miles (11 km) of seafront were laid out along the famous sandy beach. Further attractions included the building (1895) of the 520-foot (158-metre) Blackpool Tower, a regional landmark modeled on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and the introduction of illuminations, a complex decoration of seafront buildings by coloured lights and tableaux.
Piers, golf courses, swimming pools, an ice rink, a zoological park, and extensive amusement parks help attract millions of visitors annually, many of them members of working-class families from the industrial regions of the North of England. The town is also home to the Blackpool Opera House, one of the largest theatres in the United Kingdom. In addition, Blackpool has developed as a major British conference and convention centre. Area 14 square miles (35 square km). Pop. (2001) 142,283; (2011) 142,065.
