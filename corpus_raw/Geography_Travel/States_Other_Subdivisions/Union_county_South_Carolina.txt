Union,  county, northern South Carolina, U.S. It is bordered by the Pacolet River to the north, the Broad River to the east, and the Enoree River to the south.

The county lies in a hilly piedmont region that is mostly covered in forests of upland hardwoods and pine.
Union county was Cherokee Indian territory when European settlers began to farm tobacco and wheat there in the latter half of the 18th century. It was established as a county in 1785 and named for an interdenominational church in the area. After the American Civil War the region became a hotbed of racial animosity, climaxing in January 1871 with an attack by 500 Ku Klux Klansmen on the county jail and the lynching of eight black prisoners. Cotton was important to the economy until, as was the case in most of the state’s cotton-growing counties, economic factors, erosion, and boll weevil infestations caused cotton’s decline.
Though Union county remains a rural region, the economy is based on textile manufacturing. The city of Union is the county seat. Area 514 square miles (1,332 square km). Pop. (2000) 29,939; (2010) 28,961.
