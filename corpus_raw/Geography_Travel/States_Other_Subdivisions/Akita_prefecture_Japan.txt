Akita,   ken (prefecture), northwestern Honshu, Japan, on the Sea of Japan (East Sea) coast. The prefecture is divided between lowlands (west) and a plateau region (east). The Hachiman Plateau is dotted with volcanoes such as Mount Komaga (5,371 feet [1,637 m]), near the eastern border with Iwate prefecture. The plateau is covered with white fir trees and alpine plants that grow amid fissures yielding steam, smoke, and boiling mud. In the extreme northeast, on the border with Aomori prefecture, is Towada Lake, which is the central feature of Towada-Hachimantai National Park.
Akita Plain, west of the Ōu and Dewa mountain ranges, is crossed by rivers flowing into the Sea of Japan. Chief among them are the Yoneshiro River (north), the Omono River (central), and the Ishizawa River (south). Hachirō Lagoon, on the Oga Peninsula, was once the second largest body of water in Japan after Lake Biwa and was about 50 miles (80 km) in circumference, but it was almost totally reclaimed for rice cultivation during the 10-year period after 1958.
Lumbering is also important in the prefecture. Mineral wealth includes deposits of copper, sulfur, lead, and manganese. Before and immediately after World War II, oil refineries were operated in Akita, along the Sea of Japan, but as crude-oil imports rose sharply, the oil refineries moved to the Pacific coast for convenience of importing. Akita city, the prefecture capital and major city, still produces some petroleum products and chemicals; it is served by the outport of Tsuchizakiminato. Akita University, founded in 1949, is located there. Noshiro is known for its wood products. Other important towns are Honjō, Oga, Yokote, and Ōdate. Area 4,483 square miles (11,612 square km). Pop. (2005) city, 333,109; prefecture, 1,145,501.
