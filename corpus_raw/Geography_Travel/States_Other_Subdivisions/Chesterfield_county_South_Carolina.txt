Chesterfield,   northeastern South Carolina, U.S. It is bordered to the north by North Carolina, to the east by the Great Pee Dee River, and to the west by the Lynches River; it is also drained by Black Creek. It lies for the most part in the Fall Line sandhills and is heavily forested in pines, hardwoods, and mixed forests. Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge, Sand Hills State Forest, and Cheraw State Park constitute much of the county’s centre.
Catawba Indians inhabited the area in the late 17th century. Chesterfield county was established in 1798 and named for Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th earl of Chesterfield. The opening of the Great Pee Dee River to boat—particularly steamboat—traffic early in the 19th century was a major factor in attracting settlers to the region. During the American Civil War, Union forces under General William Tecumseh Sherman laid waste to the area. The abandoned Brewer Gold Mine, near Jefferson, was once a major contributor to the county’s economy.
The raising of livestock (especially turkeys), tobacco, peaches, and soybeans is important. Logging and the manufacture of wood, fabricated metal, clothing, and other textile products are also mainstays of the economy. Chesterfield is the county seat, and Cheraw is the largest town. Area 799 square miles (2,069 square km). Pop. (2000) 42,765; (2010) 46,734.
