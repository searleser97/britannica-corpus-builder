Sucre,  estado (state), northeastern Venezuela. It is bounded to the north and west by the Caribbean Sea and to the east by the Gulf of Paria.
Fishing in the Caribbean is an important component of Sucre’s economy. Indeed, in the early 20th century Sucre accounted for nearly half of Venezuela’s fishing fleet and provided about half of the national catch (including mackerel, mullet, grouper, tuna, sardines, shrimp, and lobster).Cumaná, the state capital and a commercial port, has an important fishing-canning industry. Founded as Nueva Toledo in 1521, Cumaná also claims to be the oldest settlement on the South American mainland.
Sucre is traversed by the country’s northeastern highlands. Despite rugged terrain and excessive dryness in the west, the state makes a significant contribution to Venezuelan agriculture as the country’s leading producer of avocados and mapuey tubers. Other crops include cacao, tobacco, coconut, coffee, bananas, and sugarcane. The state also produces rum, chocolate, leather, and textiles. Sucre’s mineral resources include asphalt from Lake Guanoco, salt from the Araya Peninsula, and gypsum from near Macuro. Area 4,556 square miles (11,800 square km). Pop.
