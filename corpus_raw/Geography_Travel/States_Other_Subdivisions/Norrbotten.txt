From the coast the land rises to the barren, mountainous frontier with Norway; this area contains the highest point in Sweden, Mount Kebne (6,926 feet [2,111 metres]).
Few crops can mature in the short summer, and timber grows only slowly; but the region’s vast iron deposits are worked at Kiruna, Gällivare, and Malmberget, and iron is smelted at Luleå, the capital. Area  40,931 square miles (106,012 square km). Pop. (2005 est.) 252,585.
