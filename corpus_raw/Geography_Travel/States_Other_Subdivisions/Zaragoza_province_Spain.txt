Zaragoza, conventional Saragossa,  provincia (province) in the comunidad aut贸noma (autonomous community) of Aragon, northeastern Spain. Together with the provinces of Huesca and Teruel, it formed the old kingdom of Aragon. It extends north and south of the middle course of the Ebro River; it reaches the foot of the Pyrenees to the north. Zaragoza is bounded by the provinces of Tarragona, Lleida, and Huesca to the east and northeast, by Guadalajara and Teruel to the south, and by Navarra, La Rioja, and Soria to the west. The relief is mostly gently rolling tableland drained by the Ebro and its tributaries. Scarce annual rainfall of less than 15 to 18 inches (380 to 460 mm) in the Ebro basin makes irrigation important. All the main settlements are in the irrigated valleys, the Ebro being the chief link, with the Jal贸n Valley to the southwest ranking next in importance.
Cereals, especially wheat and barley, are the mainstay of the economy, followed by corn (maize), alfalfa (lucerne), stock raising (sheep), fruit (grapes, peaches, apples, and pears), and horticulture. From Daroca down the Jiloca Valley into the Jal贸n Valley is an important fruit-growing district. Services and industry are largely concentrated in the provincial capital, Zaragoza city. The main industries of the province are automotive, chemical, and textile manufacturing, metalworking, and food processing. Apart from the capital, the main population centres are Calatayud, Tarazona de Arag贸n, Caspe, Ejea de los Caballeros, and Tauste. Area 6,670 square miles (17,275 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 932,502.
