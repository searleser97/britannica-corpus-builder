Niigata,  ken (prefecture), north-central Honshu, Japan. It lies along the Sea of Japan (East Sea) and includes the offshore islands of Sado and Awa. Niigata, along the central coast, is the prefectural capital and largest city.
Silt deposited by the Shinano and Agano rivers in the central part of the long coastline has created the lowland called the Echigo Plain, which contains the majority of the prefecture’s population. The rest of the prefecture is mountainous except for small southern coastal plains and lowlands along other river courses. Niigata is one of Japan’s largest rice producers, providing major surpluses for shipment to city markets. Plentiful hydroelectric power generated in the interior mountains has stimulated industrial growth (chemicals, metals, machinery) in such cities as Niigata, Kashiwazaki, Naoetsu, Sanjō, and Takada. The prefecture also produces petroleum (Nagaoka and Kashiwazaki) and natural gas. Area 4,858 square miles (12,582 square km). Pop. (2010) 2,374,450.
