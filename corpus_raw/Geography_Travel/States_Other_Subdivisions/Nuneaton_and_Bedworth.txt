Nuneaton and Bedworth,  borough (district), administrative and historic county of Warwickshire, in the Midlands of central England. The town of Nuneaton (the administrative centre) seems to have grown around a 12th-century Benedictine nunnery, but the main impulse to growth and activity was coal mining, which began in the 13th century. Industry followed, for Nuneaton’s location—at a junction of rail routes and along the M6 motorway—made it attractive to manufacturers. Coal mining, however, had ceased by the end of the 20th century. Nuneaton and its neighbour, Bedworth, have grown into a single built-up area adjoining the city of Coventry, which lies to the south. Area 31 square miles (79 square km). Pop. (2001) 119,132; (2011) 125,252.
