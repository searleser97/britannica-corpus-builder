Kaliningrad,  oblast (region), extreme western Russia. Most of the oblast is in the basin of the Pregolya River and its tributaries. Centred on Kaliningrad city, it was formed in 1945 from the northern half of German East Prussia, which was ceded to the U.S.S.R. by the Potsdam agreement of that year. Administratively, the oblast was made part of the Russian S.F.S.R., even though it was separated from the parent republic by about 225 miles (360 km) of territory belonging to the Lithuanian, Belorussian, and Latvian republics of the U.S.S.R. When those republics achieved their independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991, the Kaliningrad oblast became a true exclave completely separated by them from the rest of Russia.
Along the coasts are the large freshwater Frisches Lagoon (Russian: Vislinsky Zaliv) and Kurisches Lagoon (Kursky Zaliv), separated from the Baltic Sea by long sandspits. The oblast comprises low, gently rolling hills and swampy lowlands; about 20 percent is in mixed forest of oak, pine, spruce, beech, and hornbeam. After World War II the regionâ€™s German inhabitants either fled or were deported, to be replaced by Russian settlers. The main branches of industry are engineering, metalworking, and paper-pulp making. Amber, once the monopoly of the Teutonic Knights, is now produced by a large combine at Yantarny. Fishing is important along the coast. Grains, potatoes, vegetables, and dairy cattle dominate agriculture. Over three-fourths of the population is urban. Area 5,830 square miles (15,100 square km). Pop. (2006 est.) 939,887.
