La Pampa,  provincia (province), central Argentina. It lies immediately west of Buenos Aires province and straddles drier sections of the Pampa (northeast) and semiarid sections of the Patagonian Desert (southwest). The east-central city of Santa Rosa is the provincial capital.
The western and southern parts of La Pampa consist of low-lying tablelands—with a broad depression in the central west—occasionally broken by hillocks, saline marshes and lakes, and intermittent streambeds. The western part of the province in particular is sparsely inhabited, while the plains of the northeast are more fertile and suited for  grazing cattle and sheep and cultivating wheat and corn (maize). Occasional severe droughts make agriculture uncertain, however.
Not until after it was made a national territory in 1884 were there renewed efforts to extend the frontier and encourage European immigration. La Pampa attained provincial status in 1952, and from that time until the overthrow of President Juan Perón (1955) the area was known by his wife’s name, Eva Perón.
Millet, sorghum, and sunflowers are also cultivated. The port of Bahía Blanca, in Buenos Aires province, serves as an outlet for the area’s produce. Santa Rosa and General Pico are the only important cities in La Pampa. Petroleum is extracted in the extreme southwest. Area 55,382 square miles (143,440 square km). Pop. (2001) 299,294; (2010) 318,951.
