North Hertfordshire,  district, administrative and historic county of Hertfordshire, southeastern England. It occupies the northern portion of the county.
The 400-foot- (120-metre-) high plateau area of North Hertfordshire district is a northeasterly extension of the chalky Chiltern Hills. The district is cultivated throughout, but especially in the fertile loams and gravels around Hitchin in the west, where cereals (including wheat and barley) are grown. Letchworth, directly northeast of Hitchin, is the district’s largest town and administrative seat; it was founded in 1903 by Sir Ebenezer Howard, an idealist and social reformer, as the world’s first garden city. His company’s aim was to provide homes in pleasant rural surroundings for families such as Howard had seen crowded into London slums 40 miles (65 km) to the south. Many experiments of combined rural-and-urban living were first undertaken in the town.
The market towns of Hitchin and Baldock have Georgian buildings and a variety of light industries, including hosiery manufacture, parchment making, and flour milling. Letchworth produces such machinery as computers, mobile cranes, and automobile gears. Sir Henry Bessemer, the 19th-century inventor and engineer who discovered the first process for manufacturing steel inexpensively, was born at Charlton, near Hitchin. Royston is the market centre for the eastern part of the district. Area 145 square miles (376 square km). Pop. (2001) 116,908; (2011) 127,114.
