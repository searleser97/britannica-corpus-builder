Amazonas,  estado (state), southern Venezuela. It is bounded on the north by the state of Bol√≠var, on the east and south by Brazil, and on the west by Colombia. The large but sparsely populated state lies within the drainage basins of the Orinoco River, which rises near the Brazilian border, and the Negro River, which is a northern tributary of the Amazon. Near the centre of the territory is a maze of intricate natural channels. One stretch of 204 miles (328 km), the Casiquiare, flows south from the Orinoco; it is usually navigable by small boats for half the year and links the Orinoco with the Negro and, thus, the Amazon. Amazonas also includes the western outliers of the Guiana Highlands.
Largely unexplored, the state consists mainly of hot, humid rainforest, with much tropical savanna. More than half of the inhabitants are forest-dwelling Indians who hunt and fish for food, mainly on a subsistence basis. Puerto Ayacucho, the state capital, lies on the Orinoco, just below rapids that block continuous navigation of the river. The main economic activities are agriculture, fishing, tourism, and the crafts industry.  Transportation is mainly by boat, airplane, and dugout canoe. Area 69,554 square miles (180,145 square km). Pop. (2001) 70,464; (2011) 146,480.
