Stockton-on-Tees,  town and unitary authority, northeastern England. The unitary authority encompasses an area on both sides of the River Tees. The section north of the Tees, including the historic town of Stockton, forms part of the geographic and historic county of Durham. The section to the south belongs to the geographic county of North Yorkshire and the historic county of Yorkshire. Stockton-on-Tees is part of the Teesside metropolitan area.
The town of Stockton lies on the left bank of the River Tees 12 miles (19 km) from the river’s North Sea mouth. It developed as a market town around the manor house and later castle of the bishops of Durham, who granted its charter in 1310. Its importance as a port was enhanced by the construction of a stone bridge across the Tees in 1769 and a railway to the Durham coalfield in 1825. This Stockton and Darlington Railway, built by George Stephenson, was the world’s first passenger railway.
The unitary authority includes both agriculture and industry. There are petrochemical and fertilizer plants at Billingham, ironworks at Stockton, and heavy engineering works at Thornaby-on-Tees. The area’s heavy industry declined during the late 20th century, and light industry and service activities grew in economic importance. Area 79 square miles (204 square km). Pop. (2001) 178,408; (2011) 191,610.
