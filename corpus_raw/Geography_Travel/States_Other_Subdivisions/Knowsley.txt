Apart from Prescot, which was an important watchmaking centre in the 18th century, most industrial development in Knowsley took place during the 20th century. Huyton-with-Roby grew rapidly between 1930 and 1950 as a suburb of Liverpool. Kirkby developed after 1952 when Liverpool began to build a new town around an industrial estate. Other suburban housing development has taken place at Knowsley and Halewood. Halewood was also chosen in 1960 for the site of a new automobile plant, at that time one of the worldâ€™s largest self-contained industrial complexes. Other major industry in the borough includes the manufacture of electrical cables at Prescot and a range of engineering, food, and light industries. Part of Knowsley estate is now a wild animal safari park. Area 34 square miles (87 square km). Pop. (2001) 150,459; (2011) 145,893.
