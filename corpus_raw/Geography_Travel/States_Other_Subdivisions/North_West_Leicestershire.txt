North West Leicestershire,  district, administrative and historic county of Leicestershire, south-central England, incorporating one of the oldest (13th century) coal-mining areas in Great Britain. It is essentially an upland area of undulating meadows, but some cultivation of crops occurs in the southwest and along the River Soar valley in the north. The two principal towns, Coalville (the district’s administrative centre) and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, are in the upland area bordering Charnwood Forest, a former royal hunting ground to the east. Charnwood Forest consists of a series of barren ridges rising above 900 feet (275 metres) and exposing outcrops of late Precambrian tuffs, some of England’s oldest bedrock.
The ruins of the 15th-century Ashby Castle are at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and the tournament field described in the novel Ivanhoe by Sir Walter Scott lies about 1 mile (1.5 km) north. Many monasteries were built in the district in the 12th and early 13th centuries. A mid-19th-century Cistercian (Trappist) abbey remains in Charnwood Forest.
Declining amounts of coal were mined near Coalville, Ibstock, and Moira until the 1980s, when mining operations ceased. Coalville is now industrially diversified, with brick and tile making and metalworks. Ashby-de-la-Zouch manufactures biscuits (cookies) and soap. East Midlands (international) Airport in the northern part of the district serves Greater Derby, Nottingham, and Leicester. Snibston, one of the former collieries at Coalville, has been converted to a museum and recreation centre. Area 108 square miles (279 square km). Pop. (2001) 85,503; (2011) 93,468.
