Aisén, also spelled Aysén, in full Aisén del General Carlos Ibáñez del Campo,  región, southern Chile, bounded on the east by Argentina and on the west by the Pacific Ocean. Aisén includes the Chonos Archipelago, the Taitao Peninsula, and the mainland between the Palena River in the north and O’Higgins Lake in the south. It is divided into the provinces of Aisén, General Carrera, Coihaique, and Capitán Pratt. In the south and east the Andes Mountains rise from 3,000 to 13,000 feet (1,000 to 4,000 metres), appearing as rugged blocks separated by glaciated valleys and fjords. Perennial snowfields cap most elevations above 3,000 feet; glaciers extend into the valleys and, in some cases, to the sea. The rough land at lower elevations is forested, chiefly with broad-leaved evergreens. Heavy, all-year rains and uniformly cool temperatures prevail. The rivers of Aisén are among the most turbulent in Chile.
The region’s inhabitants grow potatoes, wheat, beans, lettuce, rhubarb, and berries and raise sheep and cattle. Lumber, gold, silver, lead, and zinc are also produced in the region. Coihaique is the largest town and regional capital. Area 41,890 square miles (108,494 square km). Pop. (2002) 89,986; (2017) 103,158.
