Otago,  regional council, southeastern South Island, New Zealand. It encompasses the Otago Mountains, a fragmented schist plateau. The region stretches westward across South Island from the South Pacific Ocean to include the eastern slopes of the Southern Alps. It also includes the glacially excavated lakes of Wakatipu, Wanaka, and Hawea; the Remarkables (rising to 6,798 feet [2,072 metres]) and other inland ranges; and the Clutha River, New Zealand’s largest river by volume, which empties into the Pacific near the towns of Balclutha and Kaitangata.
European settlement of the eastern part of the area began in the late 1830s and was spurred on by a gold rush in 1861. Noted for its spectacular scenery, the western portion of the region remains relatively unpopulated. Tourism, sheep raising, and mixed farming are important economic activities. The port city of Dunedin, founded by Scottish settlers in 1848, is the region’s largest settlement and an industrial and educational centre. The town of Oamaru is known for its white limestone buildings. Area 12,062 square miles (31,241 square km). Pop. (2006) 193,800; (2012 est.) 211,200.
