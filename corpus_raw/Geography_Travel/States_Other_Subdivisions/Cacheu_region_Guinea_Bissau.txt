Cacheu,  region located in northwestern Guinea-Bissau. The Cacheu River flows east-west through the region, and the Mansôa River, which also flows east-west, forms Cacheu’s border with the neighbouring region of Biombo; both rivers empty into the Atlantic Ocean. The area around the mouth of the Cacheu River is mostly covered with mangrove forests. Surrounding the town of Cacheu, the regional capital, are coconut trees and subsistence crops (including millet, corn [maize], sorghum, and rice); some of the land is also used for grazing cattle, sheep, and goats. Phosphates are found near Cacheu, Barro, and Bigene towns. The Mandyako peoples are the main ethnic group; others are the Bram, Felup, and Bijagós. Cacheu town is connected by road with Bissau, the national capital. Pop. (2004 est.) 164,676.
