Agriculture is not of great importance, though grain and potatoes are grown, and there is some stock raising. Along the coast, particularly around Gävle, the capital, there is extensive industrial development; paper and textiles are manufactured, and lumbering and sawmilling are important. Sandviken, which has had a steel industry since 1860, is noted for its saws. Other principal cities are Söderhamn, Bollnäs, and Hudiksvall. Area 7,628 square miles (19,756 square km). Pop.
