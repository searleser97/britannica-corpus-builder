Cabinda, also spelled Kabinda,  northern exclave of Angola, on the west (Atlantic) coast of Africa north of the Congo River estuary. It is bordered by the Republic of the Congo to the north and northeast and is separated from Angola by part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the south and southeast. Its coastline extends for 56 miles (90 km), and its greatest width is 70 miles (113 km). With continued offshore oil discoveries, crude oil has become Cabindaâ€™s dominant export. The production of timber, palm oil and kernels, cocoa, and coffee has declined since the rise of the local oil industry. The chief town, Cabinda, is an oil port on the right bank of the Bele (Lulondo) River.
From the mid-1970s the region was disrupted by guerrilla activities of various factions of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) as well as other groups, which were fighting for Cabindan independence from Angola. In 2004 some of the groups formed an umbrella organization, Cabinda Forum for Dialogue (which also included civil and religious groups), and their demands for independence intensified. The organization and the Angolan government signed a peace accord in 2006, largely ending the conflict in the exclave, although skirmishes occurred sporadically after that. Beginning in 2016, there was a resurgence in fighting as FLEC increased its attacks on Angolan military forces in Cabinda. Area 2,807 square miles (7,270 square km). Pop. (2014) 688,285.
