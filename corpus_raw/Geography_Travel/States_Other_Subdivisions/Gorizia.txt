Gorizia, German Görz, Slovene Gorica,  town, Friuli–Venezia Giulia regione, northeastern Italy, on the Isonzo River north of Trieste. From the 11th century Gorizia was the seat of the independent county of Gorizia until it passed to Austria in 1500. A noted cultural centre under Austrian rule, it was the capital of the Habsburg crownland of Görz-Gradisca after 1815. The area, especially around Monte San Michele (899 feet [274 m]) to the southwest, was the scene of heavy fighting between the Austrians and the Italians during World War I, and the town, much damaged, was annexed by Italy in 1919. By treaty in 1947 Yugoslavia received the northern outskirts of the town, and the adjoining Yugoslav town of Nova Gorica was developed.
The partly 14th-century cathedral contains treasures of the patriarchate of Aquileia, which was dissolved in 1751 and replaced by the archbishoprics of Gorizia and Udine. Also notable are the old castle of the counts with the Church of San Spirito, the Baroque Church of San Ignazio, the historical museum in the Palazzo Attemis (1745), and the war museum. The town lost its commercial importance after the border settlement, but it has foundries and chemical and textile industries. Pop. (2006 est.) mun., 36,418.
