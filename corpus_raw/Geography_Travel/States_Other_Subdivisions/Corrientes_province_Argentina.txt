Corrientes,  provincia  (province), northeastern Argentina. It is bounded by the Paran치 River (north and west), which forms the border with Paraguay (north), and by the Uruguay River (southeast), which borders Uruguay and Brazil. The city of Corrientes, in the northwest on the Paran치, is the provincial capital.
Corrientes, which forms part of a region known as the Argentine Mesopotamia, is a low-lying subtropical province of plains, channels, lakes, and marshes ascending to slightly higher elevations in the east. A dominating feature is the expansive Iber치 wetlands area (Esteros del Iber치) in the north-central part of the province.
The area was settled by Jesuits who established reducciones (work missions) in the 16th century. In 1865, during the War of the Triple Alliance, Paraguayan forces invaded the province and were defeated at the city of Corrientes.
Economic activities are based on agriculture (rice, cotton, citrus fruits, tobacco, and cattle raising), and logging is also important. Tourism, based on hunting and fishing facilities throughout the province, is an additional source of income. There is little industry. Rivers provide the chief means of communication in the northeast, but the chief towns are connected by rail and road. Area 34,054 square miles (88,199 square km). Pop.
