San Fernando,  cabecera (county seat) and partido (county) of northeastern Gran (Greater) Buenos Aires, Argentina. It lies north of the city of Buenos Aires, in Buenos Aires provincia (province), on the Río de la Plata estuary.
Colonization of the area began with the second and permanent founding of Buenos Aires (1580). During that period the region was known as Costa de Monte Grande. In 1780 the parish of Nuestra Señora del Puerto de Las Conchas (“Our Lady of the Port of the Shells”) was established. A settlement, founded in 1806 as San Fernando de Buena Vista, later became a part of the county established in 1821.
The town of San Fernando was given city status in 1909. It is a river port and centre for cattle raising. Industries in the present-day county process dairy products, fish, and fruit. Furniture is manufactured from lumber produced by the region’s sawmills, and paper products are made. Quarrying is also important.
The southern region of San Fernando has become part of the north-northwestern suburban area of Gran Buenos Aires. San Fernando’s population density is the lowest of all the counties of Gran Buenos Aires because of the relatively unpopulated northern region. Railway lines, the national highway system, and a local airport connect the southern portion of the county to other parts of Argentina. The sparsely populated marshlands of the northern region have few transportation and communication links. Pop. (2001) county, 148,064; (2010) county, 163,240.
