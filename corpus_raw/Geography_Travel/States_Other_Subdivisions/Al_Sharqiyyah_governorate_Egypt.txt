Al-Sharqiyyah, also spelled Sharkia,  muḥāfaẓah (governorate) of the eastern Nile River delta, Lower Egypt, touching the Mediterranean Sea just west of Suez. In the northeast it includes a part of the large Lake Manzala, a brackish coastal lagoon. Its chief port is Al-Manzilah, at the head of a branch railway from Al-Manṣūrah on the Damietta branch of the Nile.
Before it was split up during the Fāṭimid period, the territory included Al-Daqahliyyah and other Nile delta districts. In 1315 the southern part of Al-Sharqiyyah split off to form Al-Qalyūbiyyah. In the Middle Ages the area witnessed numerous Coptic and Arab uprisings, and it has served as an invasion route for foreign armies. Bilbays, a former capital of Al-Sharqiyyah and a medieval fortress town, lies in the southeast, 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Cairo. During the 19th century Bilbays was supplanted as capital by Al-Zaqāzīq, a rail centre 13 miles (22 km) to the north-northwest.
Al-Sharqiyyah is densely populated. The flat, alluvial governorate supports a variety of irrigated crops, including cotton, corn (maize), rice, wheat, soybeans, peanuts (groundnuts), sesame, and citrus fruits. Ducks and chickens are raised, and Lake Manzala supports fishing. Fish farming has also been introduced. Industries include food processing, beer brewing, and electrical-components manufacturing. Several irrigation canals cross the governorate, including the Sharqiyyah, which partly follows the bed of the old Pelusiac channel of the Nile. The major east-west canal is the Ismailia Canal, linking Ismailia on the Suez Canal with Al-Zaqāzīq through Wadi Tūmīlat. It follows the course of a canal dug in ancient times. Area 1,614 square miles (4,180 square km). Pop. (2010 est.) 5,736,644.
