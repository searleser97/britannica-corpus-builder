Guárico,  estado (state), north-central Venezuela. It is bounded north by the central highlands and south by the Orinoco River.
Until the 1960s life in this state in the Llanos (plains) was dominated by cattle raising. With the completion of the Guárico River Reclamation Project near Calabozo, however, more than 50,000 acres (20,000 hectares) of the plains were brought under irrigation. Guárico is one of Venezuela’s principal rice-, sorghum-, and corn- (maize-) producing states.  Cotton, cassava, beans, tomatoes, tobacco, and feed crops are also grown. Oil exploration also plays a significant role in the state’s economy. Highways traverse the state, linking the capital, San Juan de los Morros, with the major urban centres of northern Venezuela. Area 25,091 square miles (64,986 square km). Pop. (2001) 627,086; (2011) 747,739.
