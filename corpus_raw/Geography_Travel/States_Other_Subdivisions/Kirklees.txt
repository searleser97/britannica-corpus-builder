Kirklees,  metropolitan borough, metropolitan county of West Yorkshire, historic county of Yorkshire, northern England. It takes its name from Kirklees Hall (17th century), whose estate houses a small Cistercian priory (1155) and the reputed grave of Robin Hood.

From Huddersfield, in the River Colne valley, a metropolitan area sprawls into the River Calder valley and north and east into the River Spen valley.
