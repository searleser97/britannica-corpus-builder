Kerguelen Islands,  archipelago in the southern Indian Ocean. Administratively a part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands (Terres Australes et Antarctiques Françaises), it consists of the island of Kerguelen (also known as Desolation Island) and nearly 300 islets, which together cover about 2,400 square miles (6,200 square km). Heavily glaciated Kerguelen Island, about 100 miles (160 km) in length, has active glaciers and peaks up to 6,445 feet (1,965 metres).
Discovered in 1772 by the French navigator Yves-Joseph de Kerguélen-Trémarec and later explored by the British explorer Captain James Cook, the archipelago was often frequented by whalers and seal hunters. In 1950 a permanent base and scientific centre, Port-aux-Français, was established on the main island.
