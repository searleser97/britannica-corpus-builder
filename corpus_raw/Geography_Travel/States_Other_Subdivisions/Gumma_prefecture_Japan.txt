Gumma,  landlocked ken (prefecture), east-central Honshu, Japan. Maebashi, the prefectural capital, is in south-central Gumma.
Most of the prefecture’s area is mountainous, with two-thirds of the land above 1,650 feet (500 metres) in elevation and volcanic peaks towering over 6,560 feet (2,000 metres). The southeastern corner of the prefecture constitutes the western portion of the Kantō Plain. Maebashi and most of Gumma’s population are concentrated on that small segment of the plain.
Sericulture and wheat cultivation are major economic activities. Industry, particularly auto manufacturing, increased dramatically during the late 1960s, influenced by the Keihin Industrial Zone to the southeast. Mountain forests and mineral deposits (sulfur, manganese, limestone) are exploited. The silk-reeling industry is conducted on a small scale in Maebashi, Tomioka, Kiryū, and Isezaki. Mount Haruna northwest of Maebashi is a popular tourist attraction, and nearby Lake Haruna offers ice fishing in winter. National parks located in the western and northern mountainous border areas also offer recreational opportunities. Gumma University in Maebashi was founded in 1949. Area 2,457 square miles (6,363 square km). Pop. (2010) 2,008,068.
