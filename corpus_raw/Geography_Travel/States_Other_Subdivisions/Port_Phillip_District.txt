Port Phillip District,   (1802â€“51), the original name of the area of the Australian colony and present commonwealth state of Victoria. It was discovered in 1802 by Lieutenant John Murray of the Royal Navy and soon afterward named for Governor Arthur Phillip of New South Wales, of which the area became part. It remained unsettled until 1835, when a group of Tasmanian sheepmen (the Port Phillip Association) defied a government ban on settlement and moved large flocks to the district. This action unleashed a flood of settlers from Tasmania and New South Wales and the Sydney authorities recognized the development by sending civil officials to the district in 1836. The district quickly grew around the city of Melbourne, and in 1851 it became the self-governing colony of Victoria.
