British Antarctic Territory,  a territory of the United Kingdom lying southeast of South America, extending from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the Pacific Ocean on the west. Triangular in shape, it has an area (mostly ocean) of 2,095,000 square miles (5,425,000 square km), bounded by the South Pole (south), latitude 60° S (north), and by longitudes 20° W (east) and 80° W (west). It includes all land areas south of 60° S and between the aforementioned longitudes, including the South Orkney Islands, the South Shetland Islands, the Antarctic Peninsula and adjacent islands, and mainland Antarctica extending to the South Pole. In area, the land portion of the territory covers about 660,000 square miles (1,700,000 square km). Most of the islands in the territory are glaciated; the Antarctic Peninsula is mountainous, with a snow-covered plateau extending the length of the peninsula, rising from 4,000 feet (1,200 m) in the north to about 7,000 feet (2,000 m) in the south; and the main continental area is covered by permanent ice cap and fringed by floating or grounded ice shelves.
Designated a territory in 1962 by the British government, it consists of the area (excepting South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands) previously known as the Falkland Islands Dependencies. The territory is administered by a High Commissioner resident in Stanley, Falkland Islands. The population of the territory (usually between 50 and 100) consists of scientists and technicians who maintain the British Antarctic Survey stations. In the summer months, relief personnel and summer field-workers arriving by airplane and ship enlarge the population.
Argentina claims the Antarctic region bounded by latitude 60° S and longitudes 25° W and 74° W; Chile claims the area bounded by latitude 60° S and longitudes 53° W and 90° W. All territorial claims in Antarctica south of 60° S, including the British one that is the basis of the British Antarctic Territory, are in abeyance for the duration of the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.
