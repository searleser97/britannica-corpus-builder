Uri,  canton, central Switzerland, traversed by the steep-sided valleys of the Reuss River and its tributaries. About one-half of the canton’s area is reckoned as productive. Forests occupy part of the canton, and more than 20 percent of the unproductive area in Uri is covered with glaciers. The highest summit in Uri is the Dammastock (11,909 feet [3,630 m]), north of the Furka Pass.
First mentioned in ad 732 as the place of banishment of the abbot of Reichenau by the Duke of Alemannia, the area was given in 853 by Louis the German to the nunnery at Zürich that he had just founded. The name Uri is probably derived from aurochs (German auerochs, “wild ox”), a bull’s head having been borne traditionally as the arms of the region. As early as 1243 Uri had a common seal, and its privileges were recognized by Rudolf of Habsburg in 1274. With Schwyz and Unterwalden it founded the Everlasting League in 1291. It participated in the victory over the Austrians at Sempach in 1386 and annexed Urseren in 1410. At the Reformation, Uri clung to Roman Catholicism. Having formed part of the huge canton of Waldstätten in the Helvetic Republic after 1798, it became an independent canton again in 1803. It resisted all attempts at religious and constitutional reform, joined the League of Sarnen in 1832 to maintain the Swiss Confederation pact of 1815 without revision, and became one of the members of the Sonderbund (separatist Catholic league) in 1845. Its present constitution dates from 1888, and its Landsgemeinde (open-air assembly) held annual meetings until 1928 near Altdorf (q.v.), the capital and largest town.
There are some cultivated fields in the Reuss River valley and pastures on the lower mountain slopes, but little of the land is capable of further cultivation because of the extremely uneven terrain. The chief railway is the main St. Gotthard line, and much of the hydroelectric power produced by plants on the Reuss is used for railway traction. Forestry is important, and there are cable and rubber factories at Altdorf. Tourism is aided by excellent roads leading to mountain passes giving access to adjacent cantons. The population is German speaking and Roman Catholic. Area 416 square miles (1,077 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 34,948.
