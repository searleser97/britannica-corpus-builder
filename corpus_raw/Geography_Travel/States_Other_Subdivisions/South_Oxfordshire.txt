South Oxfordshire,  district, administrative county of Oxfordshire, south-central England. It occupies an area in the southeastern part of the county between the cities of Oxford (northwest) and Reading (south). Most of the district lies within the historic county of Oxfordshire, but the areas to the west of the River Thames, including Wallingford, form part of the historic county of Berkshire. District offices are located at Crowmarsh Gifford, a settlement across the Thames from Wallingford.
The district is generally a clay valley drained by the Thames and is dominated by the beech-forested Chiltern Hills in the southeast. South Oxfordshireâ€™s economy is largely agricultural, primarily based on corn (maize), potatoes, cereals, and dairy cattle. Henley-on-Thames, the largest town of the district (located east of the Chilterns in its southeastern corner), has iron foundries and malt breweries and has become internationally known for its annual Henley Royal Regatta rowing races. The towns of Wallingford in the centre and Thame in the northeast are other local market centres. The village of Culham, 7 miles (11 km) south of Oxford, is the site of an important atomic-energy research laboratory. Nearby Dorchester was founded as a Roman town; later it became the cathedral city of Wessex (in the 7th century) and the cathedral city of Mercia (from the late 9th to the late 11th century). Area 262 square miles (679 square km). Pop. (2001) 128,188; (2011) 134,257.
