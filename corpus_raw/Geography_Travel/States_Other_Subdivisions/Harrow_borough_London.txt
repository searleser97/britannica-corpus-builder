Harrow,  outer borough of London, England, forming part of the northwestern perimeter of the metropolis. It is in the historic county of Middlesex. Previously a municipal borough, Harrow became a London borough in 1965. It includes (from northwest to southeast) the areas of Pinner Green, Hatch End, Stanmore, Pinner, Harrow Weald, Burnt Oak, Harrow Garden Village, Harrow (with Harrow on the Hill), Wealdstone, Northolt Park, and Roxeth.
The earthwork at Grim’s Dyke (Grimsdyke, or Grimm’s Ditch) is testament to the Saxon settlement of the area. Medieval and later architecture in Harrow includes the 14th-century Headstone Manor, a half-timbered structure guarded by a moat; it was the residence of archbishops from the 14th to the 16th century. The medieval Church of St. Mary stands on Harrow Hill and is a conspicuous landmark rising above flat clay country that was overspread by housing in the 20th century, following the development of the electrified suburban railways. Also on the hill is the eminent public (i.e., fee-paying) Harrow School (1572). In Pinner stand the medieval church of St. John the Baptist and several 16th-century houses and barns. The present Bentley Priory (late 18th century) in Stanmore was the operational headquarters of the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain (1940–41) in World War II.
The town centre by the railway station has become one of the main shopping areas of the northwestern sector of Greater London, and there are light industries at nearby Wealdstone. Ethnic minorities, notably South Asians, make up about two-fifths of Harrow’s population. Area 19 square miles (50 square km). Pop. (2001) 206,814; (2011) 239,056.
