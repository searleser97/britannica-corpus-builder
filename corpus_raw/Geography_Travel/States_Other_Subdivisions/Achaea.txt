Achaea, Modern Greek Akhaï´a,  perifereiakí enótita (regional unit) and historic region of Greece on the north coast of the Peloponnese (Modern Greek: Pelopónnisos), south of the Gulf of Corinth (Korinthiakós). In ancient times it was bounded on the west by Elis (modern Ilía), on the south by Mount Erymanthus and Arcadia (Arkadía), and on the east by Sicyon (modern Sikión). The highway and railway from Athens (Athína) to Pátrai follow the north coast of the Peloponnese.
Early in the 4th century bce the 12 cities of Achaea formed the Achaean League, a military alliance. In Hellenistic times, the league admitted non-Achaean allies and became the chief political power in Greece. It went over to Rome in 198 bce but was dissolved by the Romans in 146 bce, after which it was annexed to the Roman province of Macedonia. In 27 bce it became the centre of the Roman senatorial province of Achaea, which included all of Greece south of Thessaly. After various invasions and dismemberments in the Middle Ages, Achaea was conquered by the Turks in 1460. It was in the monastery of Ayía Lavra near Kalávrita in this province that the standard of the Greek Revolution was raised in March of 1821. Achaea was liberated from the Turks in 1828.
The name Achaea was also applied in antiquity to a region west of the Gulf of Pagasae (Pagasitikós Kólpos) in southern Thessaly (Thessalía), which was known as Achaea Phthiotis. In Mycenaean times the name referred to the whole Peloponnese. Pop. (2001) 318,928; (2011) 309,694.
