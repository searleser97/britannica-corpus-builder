Western Isles, Gaelic Eilean Siar,  council area of Scotland, in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwestern coast of the Scottish mainland, comprising the islands of the Outer Hebrides. Lewis, the northern part of the principal island of Lewis and Harris, is part of the historic county of Ross-shire in the historic region of Ross and Cromarty, and the rest of the Western Isles council area belongs to the historic county of Inverness-shire.
Crofting (tenant farming) is the traditional mainstay of the economy and still persists. The typical croft is just a few acres with a handful of sheep, a cow, and enough crops to supplement the diet and provide a small income. Peat is cut in the extensive moors of the islands’ interior and is used to heat the crofters’ homes. The islands are known for their high-quality Harris tweed, which is traditionally woven on handlooms by the crofters at home. Fishing is important, though it has declined since the heyday of herring fishery in the early 20th century. The islands also rely economically on tourism, food processing, and renewable energy. Stornoway on Lewis is the chief town and the commercial and administrative centre of the Western Isles. It has a good natural harbour and contains ship-repair facilities. Area 1,180 square miles (3,055 square km). Pop. (2001) 26,502; (2011) 27,684.
