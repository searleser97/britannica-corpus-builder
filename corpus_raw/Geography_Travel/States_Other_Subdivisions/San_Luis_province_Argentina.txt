San Luis,  provincia (province), west-central Argentina. It is separated from Mendoza province (west) by seasonal rivers having headwaters in the Andes Mountains. The central city of San Luis is the provincial capital.
The landscape of San Luis province is transitional, incorporating drier sections of the Pampa (south and east) and pre-Andean hills, mountains, and salt flats (north). Its San Luis Mountains, with elevations exceeding 6,900 feet (2,100 metres), dominate the mid-north, and salt flats make up stretches of the northwest.
The historical development of San Luis was slowed because it lacked the abundant meltwater from the snow-capped Andes (to the west) or the increased precipitation of the more humid Pampa (to the east).
Between 1594, the date of the first settlement, and the mid-18th century, Spaniards coming from Chile had difficulty in establishing permanent settlements in the face of hostile Indian attacks. Part of the historic Cuyo region, San Luis passed in 1776 from the jurisdiction of the Chilean captaincy general to that of the Viceroyalty of the RÃ­o de la Plata. It was created a province in 1832.
Cattle raising and irrigated farming of corn (maize), sorghum, and sunflowers, as well as of figs and asparagus, are important economic activities in the basins of the Quinto and Conlara rivers in northeastern San Luis province. Some lumbering also occurs in the San Luis Mountains, and tungsten (wolfram), basalt, and salt are mined and granite and onyx are quarried. The irrigated agriculture in the central Quinto and Conlara basins provides the basis for the food-processing industries of Villa Mercedes and San Luis city. Area 29,633 square miles (76,748 square km). Pop. (2001) 367,933; (2010) 432,310.
