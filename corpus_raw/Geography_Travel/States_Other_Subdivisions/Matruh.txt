Maṭrūḥ,  desert muḥāfaẓah (governorate) of Egypt that includes all of Egypt west of Al-Jīzah governorate and north of latitude 26°20′ N. Only 1 percent of its area is inhabited. It is mostly a plateau area of sedimentary rock such as limestone, averaging 700–800 feet (215–245 metres) in elevation and nowhere surpassing 1,500 feet (460 metres). Surface dissection results from wind erosion on the stone-covered wastes and sandy plains. Longitudinal belts of parallel sand dunes occur, rising to 200 feet (60 metres) in the Great Sand Sea extending south from the Siwa Oasis. Light rain falls only along the coastal plain, but underground aquifers provide water for Siwa Oasis. The Qattara Depression reaches 435 feet (133 metres) below sea level and occupies 7,000 square miles (18,000 square km), extending southward 35 miles (56 km) from the coast at Al-ʿAlamayn.
The governorate’s natural resources include petroleum, with fields at Al-ʿAlamayn and Abū al-Gharādiq and in the Qattara Depression, and natural gas, at Abū al-Gharādiq. The population is concentrated along the small coastal strip, where Roman ruins are located, and in Siwa Oasis. A railway connects the small ports of Marsā Maṭrūḥ, the capital of the governorate, and Al-Sallūm to Alexandria. Area 81,897 square miles (212,112 square km). Pop. (2006) 322,341.
