Inuvik,  northwestern region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Inuvik region was created in the early 1970s by the territorial government and was formerly part of Mackenzie and Franklin districts. It extends from Wrigley northward along the middle reaches of the Mackenzie River, which forms its heartland, to the river’s delta on the Beaufort Sea of the Arctic Ocean and includes Banks Island, the westernmost island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, to the north. The region includes the Richardson and Mackenzie mountains (in the northwest and southwest, respectively), the Mackenzie River lowlands (centre), and the Franklin Mountains (east). Most of the region lies in a subarctic coniferous forest-tundra vegetation zone. Inuvik town, located on the Mackenzie River delta, is the regional headquarters and the area’s major commercial and transportation centre. The region’s economy, once based on fur trapping and whaling, now includes the development of petroleum and natural gas resources. The population is a mix of Athabascan-speaking North American Indians, Inuit (Eskimo), and other Canadians.
