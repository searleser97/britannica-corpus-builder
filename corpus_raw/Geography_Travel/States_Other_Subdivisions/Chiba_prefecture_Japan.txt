Chiba,  ken (prefecture), east-central Honshu, Japan. It lies on the Pacific coast of the Kantō Plain and consists largely of the Bōsō Peninsula, which constitutes the eastern side of Tokyo Bay and is bordered to the north by the Tone River. Chiba city, on the northeastern coast of the bay, is the prefectural capital.
Chiba prefecture constitutes the eastern portion of the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area, and the Keihin Industrial Zone on the western side of Tokyo Bay has expanded into Chiba prefecture to include the Keiyō Industrial Zone there. Factories built on reclaimed land produce chemicals, iron, steel, petroleum products, and sake. Large natural gas deposits have been tapped. Farther inland, farms produce surpluses of rice, vegetables, eggs, and flowers for the Tokyo region, and, offshore, fisheries flourish.
Chiba city is the largest conurbation in the prefecture and is the commercial and cultural centre of the peninsula. Chōshi is a major fishing port on the eastern coast, and Tateyama and Katsuura are important southern ports. Chiba and Tateyama have air defense headquarters. Katori (formerly Sawara), on the Tone River, is a base for Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-national Park in northeastern Chiba and southern Ibaraki prefectures. The southern part of the peninsula abounds with Shintō shrines and Buddhist temples; the Buddhist Shinshō Temple (often called Narita Fudō) at Narita in the north attracts millions of pilgrims annually. Narita is also the site of Tokyo’s main international airport. Area 1,991 square miles (5,156 square km). Pop. (2010) 6,216,289.
