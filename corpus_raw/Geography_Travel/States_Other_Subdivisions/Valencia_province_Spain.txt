Valencia, Valencian València,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Valencia, eastern Spain. It is situated along the Mediterranean Sea. The province centres on the coastal plain of the Gulf of Valencia; it is limited to the south by the mountains of northern Alicante and less clearly to the north by the watershed of the Turia River. Interior plateaus rise westward in a series of faulted steps, representing the edge of the Meseta Central (plateau), trenched deeply by the gorges of the Júcar River and its chief tributary, the Cabriel. Much of the interior is wild, sparsely populated country, opening out onto the lower and richer lands around Requena and Utiel.
The coastal plain (1,244 square miles [3,222 square km]) is the largest in eastern Spain, and the great majority  of the province’s wealth and population is concentrated there. The plain’s productivity is the result of extensive irrigation, based upon the rivers and continuously developed and expanded since pre-Roman times. Chief products include oranges on the plain and rice near the coast. Cereals, fruit (peaches, tangerines, and apricots), and vegetables are also cultivated on the plain, and olives are grown on the hills, where vineyards are also found. Fishing is of some importance on the coast. Manufactures include textiles, chemicals, paper, furniture, foodstuffs, metals, and ship and automotive parts. There is a nuclear power plant at Cofrentes. The provincial capital is Valencia city; other urban centres are Alcira, Sueca, Torrente, Sagunto, and Cullera. Area 4,172 square miles (10,806 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 2,486,483.
