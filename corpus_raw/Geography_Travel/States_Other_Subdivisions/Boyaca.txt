Boyacá,  departamento, east-central Colombia. The departamento consists of cool Andean uplands in the west, densely forested lower mountain slopes, and the great expanse of the Llanos (plains) in the east. It was established in 1886. Lake Tota in the uplands is a noted beauty spot. Boyacá has traditionally had an agrarian economy based on grains, coffee, tobacco, and bananas and other fruits. It is also known for its emerald mines, the most famous of which are located at Muzo. Colombia’s first fully integrated iron and steel plant was built at Paz de Río in 1955. The plant uses iron ore and coal from major deposits nearby and produces most of the nation’s steel. Although the departamento’s transportation network is poorly developed, a major railroad and highway pass through Tunja, the departamento’s capital, and other major centres. The Chivor dam, one of the highest rock-fill dams in the world, on the Batá River, is a source of hydroelectric power. Area 8,953 square miles (23,189 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 1,265,198.
