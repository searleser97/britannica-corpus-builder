Dorchester,  county, southern South Carolina, U.S. The Edisto River forms the southwestern boundary, and the county is also drained by the Ashley River. Dorchester county lies in the flat Coastal Plain, and much of it consists of woodlands and swamps. Francis Beidler Forest is the largest remaining stand of virgin bald cypress and tupelo trees in the world. From Colleton State Park to Givhans Ferry State Park, the Edisto River is a state canoe and kayak trail.
Cusabo Indians inhabited the region when Europeans began settling Carolina in the 1670s. On a bluff overlooking the Ashley River is Old Dorchester State Park, site of a settlement (1696–1778) by Congregationalists from Massachusetts. Middleton Place, an early American landscaped garden, dates from the 18th century. Rice and indigo were important exports from the region in colonial times, when Summerville was among South Carolina’s first inland resorts, favoured by visitors fleeing the malaria of the coastal settlements. The county was established in 1897 and named for Dorchester, Massachusetts.
Agriculture (tobacco, soybeans, and hogs) and manufacturing (plastics, industrial equipment, bricks, and clay tiles) are major components of the local economy; logging and lumber milling traditionally have been important.
