Kostroma,  oblast (region), western Russia. It covers part of the middle Volga River basin. Most of the surface is a rolling, morainic plain, sloping to the Volga from the low hills of the Severnye Uvaly (“Northern Rise”), with many lakes and extensive peat bogs. The oblast, centred on Kostroma city, is heavily covered with swampy forest, or taiga, of spruce, pine, and birch, with fir in the northeast. Broad floodplain meadows fringe the rivers, and most soils are infertile. In general, the oblast is not well developed economically, having a poor communications network—apart from the Volga itself, which crosses the southwestern corner of the oblast—and having only 15 percent of its area under cultivation. Flax, fodder crops, rye, and oats are grown, and flax processing and linen making are widespread in the small towns. Small-scale timber working also is widespread. Area 23,200 square miles (60,100 square km). Pop. (2006 est.) 708,988.
