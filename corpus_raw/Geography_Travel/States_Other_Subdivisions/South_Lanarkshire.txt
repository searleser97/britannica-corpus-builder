South Lanarkshire,  council area, south-central Scotland, encompassing Clydesdale—the valley of the River Clyde—and the surrounding lowlands and uplands. South Lanarkshire extends from the heavily urbanized southern periphery of the Glasgow metropolitan area, where most of the population live, to the extensive agricultural countryside of the south, which accounts for most of the area. It lies entirely within the historic county of Lanarkshire.
Clydesdale supports intensive cultivation of fruits and vegetables (often under glass) for the Glasgow market and soft fruits for the jam-making industries of Carluke. Other important crops include barley, turnips, and fodder for the considerable numbers of beef and dairy cattle, sheep, and pigs that are raised in the surrounding valleys and uplands. The small town of Lanark is a market centre for this large agricultural hinterland. During the 19th century Hamilton developed as an industrial town based initially on lace and textile manufacture and later on coal mining, but these industries have since shut down, and it is now primarily a commercial centre and a residential suburb of Glasgow. East Kilbride houses the National Engineering Laboratory (which was sold to the TÜV SÜD group in 1995). To the north, adjacent to Glasgow, the towns of Rutherglen and Cambuslang contain a mix of residential, industrial, and commercial development. East Kilbride, Hamilton, and Lanark are the administrative centres. Area 684 square miles (1,772 square km). Pop. (2001) 302,216; (2011) 313,830.
