Bafatá,  region located in north-central Guinea-Bissau. Bafatá is crosscut by the Gêba River, which flows east-west through the northern half of the region and is navigable to Bafatá town, the regional capital. The Corubal River flows east-west to form Bafatá’s southern border with the Quinará and Tombali regions and empties into the Gêba; it is navigable throughout the Bafatá region. The Bafatá Plateau, rising to about 500 feet (150 metres) above sea level, is located in central Bafatá between the Gêba and Corubal rivers.
The northern and southern parts of the region contain timber resources, which have potential as export products. Peanuts (groundnuts) are intensively cultivated around Bafatá town and are grown in the north all the way to the border with Senegal. In the northern savanna-covered part of the region, cattle, sheep, and goats are raised. Subsistence agricultural crops include millet, rice, sorghum, and corn (maize). Near Bafatá town is a major agricultural development project, and the cultivation of cotton was introduced to the area surrounding Gêba town in central Bafatá region in the early 1980s. Gold in small quantities is found near Taibatà town in the southwest. Bafatá town is connected by road with Senegal to the north and the towns of Gabú, Mansabá, and Bambadinca to the east, west, and south, respectively. The Fulani (Fulbe) peoples are the dominant ethnic group, and the Balante and Malinke constitute most of the remainder. Pop. (2004 est.) 182,959.
