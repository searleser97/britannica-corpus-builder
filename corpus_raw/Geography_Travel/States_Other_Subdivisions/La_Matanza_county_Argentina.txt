La Matanza,  partido (county) of Gran (Greater) Buenos Aires, eastern Argentina. It is located directly southwest of the city of Buenos Aires, in Buenos Aires provincia (province). San Justo is the cabecera (county seat).
The present-day county was part of the pago (country district) of Las Conchas during the 17th and early 18th centuries. In 1730 the country district of Las Conchas was divided into four rural settlement areas, one of which was the country district of La Matanza. The county of La Matanza was established in 1784, and a justice of the peace was appointed to the region. Towns were established many years later. San Justo was founded in 1856.
The industries of La Matanza manufacture plows, automobile accessories, paper, and rubber goods. Agricultural lands, outside the built-up areas, grow wheat, corn (maize), barley, and alfalfa and support livestock.
With the growth of the national capital, La Matanza has been absorbed into the southwestern suburban fringe of Gran Buenos Aires. About half of the county lies within the Gran Buenos Aires urban area, and its numerical population has significantly increased since the 1960s. Pop. (2001) 1,253,921; (2010) 1,775,816.
