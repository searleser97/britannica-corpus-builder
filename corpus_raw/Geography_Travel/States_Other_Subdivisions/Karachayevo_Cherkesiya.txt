Karachayevo-Cherkesiya, in full Karachayevo-Cherkesskaya Respublika, also called Karachay-Cherkessia,  republic, southwestern Russia. It extends south from the foreland plains across the northern ranges and deep intervening valleys and gorges of the Greater Caucasus range as far as the crestline, which reaches 13,274 feet (4,046 metres) in Mount Dombay-Ulgen. Cherkessk is the administrative centre. The republic’s scenery is spectacular, with densely forested mountains rising through alpine meadows to rock and ice. Tourism is important.
The Karachay-Cherkess oblast (region) was first formed in 1922 for the Circassian (Russian: Cherkess; see Circassian) and Turkic Karachay peoples. The oblast was dissolved in 1926, becoming Karachay autonomous oblast and Cherkess autonomous oblast. Karachay autonomous oblast was dissolved during World War II, when the Karachays were exiled to Central Asia for their alleged collaboration with the Germans. In 1957 they were returned to form the Karachay-Cherkess autonomous oblast. During their exile, part of the territory was incorporated into the Georgian S.S.R. (now Georgia). In 1991 it became a republic. Today the Karachay and Cherkess peoples constitute only a little more than one-third of the population, while most of the rest are Russians. The majority of the republic’s population lives on the northern plains, which are in intensive agricultural use. Large numbers of sheep and cattle are kept. Most industry is concerned with processing farm produce, but nonferrous ores and some coal are mined. Area 5,450 square miles (14,100 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) 427,418.
