Būlāq, also spelled Bulak,  northwestern district of Cairo, Egypt. Situated on the Nile River, Būlāq was a major port suburb before the city of Cairo expanded to engulf it.
Būlāq had been an island until the westward recession of the Nile revealed it in the mid-14th century. It was Cairo’s main port by 1560, and it eventually became an industrial district in the early 19th century. During the rule of Muḥammad ʿAlī (1805–48) it became the site of Egypt’s first government-owned Arabic printing press. Būlāq was the original site of the Egyptian Museum, founded by the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, before the collection was moved to Cairo proper in the late 1890s.
Engulfed by the expansion of the city of Cairo, portions of Būlāq have been overcome by a rapid gentrification process accompanied by the demolition of many of the older structures to make room for high-rise residential and commercial buildings. The mosques of Abū al-ʿAlāʾ and Sīnān Pasha are among the few historic buildings in Būlāq to survive. In addition to its poorer neighbourhoods, the district is a centre for workshops, light industry, and trade schools.
