Jujuy,  provincia (province), extreme northwestern Argentina, bordering Chile (west) and Bolivia (north). San Salvador de Jujuy, in the far southeast, is the provincial capital.
Jujuy encompasses several cordilleras of the Andes Mountains—reaching elevations of 16,500 feet (5,000 metres) and separated by the eastern portion of a bleak tableland 11,500 feet (3,500 metres) high called the Atacama Plateau—that descend on the east to form sub-Andean ranges and valleys. The eastern Andean and sub-Andean ranges are drained by the U-shaped Río Grande–San Francisco river system, which in its northeasternmost extension, below 1,000 feet (300 metres), is warm and humid. The Humahuaca Gorge, in the northwestern part of the system, is a scenic canyon running northward 100 miles (160 km) along the Río Grande from San Salvador de Jujuy. The gorge was historically important as a trade route up through the Atacama Plateau to Bolivia and Peru and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2003.
The region was part of the Inca empire in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Jujuy derived its name from a type of Inca provincial governor (xuxuyoc) encountered there by the Spanish in the late 16th century. During colonial times the encomiendas (estates) of the region produced foodstuffs and mules for the Bolivian silver mines. The province was organized in 1834, when it was separated from Salta province. With the breakup of Los Andes national territory in 1943, it absorbed Susques department.
Much of Argentina’s mineral resources are located in Jujuy. Deposits that have been commercially exploited include zinc, copper, tin, and lead. However, inadequate transportation facilities and declining world mineral prices hampered the mining sector in the late 20th century. Commercial agriculture (chiefly sugarcane and tobacco but also tomatoes and peppers) is largely restricted to the San Francisco and lower Río Grande valleys. Pack animals (mules, asses, and llamas) are raised, as are sheep, goats, and lesser numbers of cattle. Some 20 unadorned rural chapels dating from the 16th to the 18th century are extant in the Humahuaca Gorge and on the Atacama Plateau. The gorge and surrounding area are a major tourist destination. Area 20,548 square miles (53,219 square km). Pop. (2001) 611,888; (2010) 673,307.
