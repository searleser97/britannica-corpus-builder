Västernorrland,  län (county) of northeast Sweden, on the Gulf of Bothnia. Its area takes in most of the two traditional landskap (provinces) of Medelpad and Ångermanland. Rising from the low coastal strip is a heavily forested interior plateau that supplies timber for sawmilling and wood-processing industries. Road and rail have largely replaced the old logging routes to the coastal mills provided by the Ångerman River and other streams. Härnösand, the capital, Sundsvall, and Örnsköldsvik are major shipping centres for timber and pulp. There are road, rail, and air connections with Stockholm. Area 8,922 square miles (23,107 square km). Pop. (2005 est.) 244,195.
