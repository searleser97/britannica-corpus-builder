Altay, also spelledAltai, formerly (1948â€“91) Gorno-Altay or (1922-48)Oirot,  republic, southern Russia, in the Altai Mountains. It s bounded on the south by Mongolia and China. It embraces a complex series of ranges and high plateaus, divided by deep valleys and broad basins, that attain a maximum height of 14,783 feet (4,506 metres) in Mount Belukha. Steppe vegetation in the basins gives way to dense coniferous forest on the mountain slopes. The republic, centred on the city of Gorno-Altaysk, was formed as an autonomous oblast in 1922 for the Mongol Oirat people, for whom it was named until 1948. Today about two-thirds of the inhabitants are Russian. The economy is largely agricultural. In the valleys oats, other grains, and vegetables are grown, but the raising of cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and yaks on the mountain and valley pastures is dominant. Fur hunting and timber working are also carried on. Area 35,700 square miles (92,600 square km). Pop. (2010 est.) 210,725.
