KaNgwane, also called Swazi,  former nonindependent Bantustan, eastern Transvaal, South Africa. It was created as a homeland for those Swazi people not residing in Swaziland.
KaNgwane (and the independent nation of Swaziland) was the traditional homeland of the Swazi, who were organized into a kingdom in the early 1800s. In 1895 the territory of KaNgwane was taken over by the Boer South African Republic (later the Crown Colony of the Transvaal). Under the apartheid system, it was designated as the Bantustan for Swazi people in 1977. KaNgwane was one of the smallest of the Bantustans and occupied mostly highveld land. It consisted of two separate land units. The main portion formed a narrow strip along the western and northern border of Swaziland; and a smaller exclave lay immediately to the north. The capital was Louieville.
Under the South African constitution that abolished the apartheid system, KaNgwane was dissolved and reincorporated into South Africa as part of the Eastern Transvaal (now Mpumalanga) province in 1994.
