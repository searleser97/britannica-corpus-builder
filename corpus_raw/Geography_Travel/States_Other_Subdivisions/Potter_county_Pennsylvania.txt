Potter,  county, northern Pennsylvania, U.S., bordering New York state to the north. It consists of a mountainous region on the Allegheny Plateau drained by the Allegheny, Cowanesque, and Genesee rivers and Oswayo, Pine, Kettle, and Sinnemahoning creeks. The county contains more than 390 square miles (1,010 square km) of state forests and seven state parks.
Potter county was organized in 1804 and named for James Potter, a general in the American Revolution. Norwegian violinist Ole Bornemann Bull founded Oleona (located south of present-day Carter Camp) for Norwegian colonists in 1852, but the settlement foundered as a result of financial and legal problems. To the east of Coudersport (the county seat) is the Coudersport Ice Mine (discovered 1894), a cave in Ice Mountain that forms icicles in the spring and summer but not in the winter. The Pennsylvania Lumber Museum west of Galeton features exhibits on lumbering, one of the stateâ€™s primary industries in the 19th century.
The economy of Potter county now depends on the manufacture of electronic equipment, logging, and health care services. Potter county is one of the most sparsely populated counties in the state. Area 1,081 square miles (2,800 square km). Pop. (2000) 18,080; (2010) 17,457.
