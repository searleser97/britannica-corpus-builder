King’s Lynn and West Norfolk,  borough (district), administrative and historic county of Norfolk, eastern England. The borough is bounded by the North Sea to the north and its shallow bay, The Wash, to the northwest. The low-lying area straddles on the west a small part of the Fens, a vast, fertile, reclaimed marshland, and on the east a generally infertile heathland sometimes made productive through modern agricultural techniques. Sand dunes are common across the borough’s northern coastline. The marginally productive sandy soils of the southeastern heathland are often planted in pine forests. Carstone, a cemented sandstone of the northeastern heathland, is quarried near Snettisham. The borough’s administrative centre is King’s Lynn.
The ancient port of King’s Lynn, at the edge of the Fens and near the mouth of the River Ouse (or Great Ouse), contains many architectural examples of its commercial history, including St. George’s Guildhall (1406). Many 12th- to 14th-century village churches in the Fens are notable for their carvings and roofs and attest to the historical agricultural prosperity of this section of the Fens.
A wide variety of produce is grown—including cereals, sugar beets, assorted fruits and vegetables, and flowers—especially in the Fens. The parish (town) of Downham Market serves as an agricultural market centre for both the Fens and the heathland. King’s Lynn and Downham Market have food-processing industries. Hunstanton, which lies 20 miles (32 km) north of King’s Lynn, is a popular coastal resort. Sandringham, the royal mansion where George VI died in 1952, is located between those towns. Area 552 square miles (1,429 square km). Pop. (2001) 135,345; (2011) 147,451.
