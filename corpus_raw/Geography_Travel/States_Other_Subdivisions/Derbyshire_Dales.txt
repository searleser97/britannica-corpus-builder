Derbyshire Dales,  district, administrative and historic county of Derbyshire, England. About half of the district lies within the scenic Peak District National Park.
The Romans mined lead in the area between Wirksworth and Castleton, and lead mining continued until the 19th century. Cotton textiles became important when Sir Richard Arkwright built the first water-powered cotton-spinning mill at Cromford in 1771. Other textile mills soon followed, using waterpower provided by the fast-flowing streams. However, agriculture, mainly dairying, remains a primary economic activity in the district.
There are numerous villages and small towns. Monyash, Wirksworth, Bonsall, and Tideswell grew as lead-mining communities, while Bakewell and Ashbourne developed as agricultural market towns. Matlock is a string of settlements along the valley of the River Derwent and includes Matlock Bath, a 19th-century spa. Among the many historic buildings in the district are the great houses of Chatsworth, Haddon, and Sudbury. Area 307 square miles (795 square km). Pop. (2001) 69,469; (2011) 79,245.
