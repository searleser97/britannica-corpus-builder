Guadalajara,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Castile–La Mancha, central Spain, occupying part of the uptilted northeastern edge of the Meseta Central (plateau). In the north are highlands that reach their greatest elevations in Cerro de San Felipe (7,214 feet [2,199 metres]), and other spurs of the Sierra de Guadarrama. In the south, the land slopes into the plateau basin of the Meseta Central. In the extreme southeast, the land rises again to form the Sierra de Albarracín. Guadalajara is crossed by several tributaries of the Tagus River, including the Henares, Jarama, and Tajuña, which have been utilized for hydroelectric power and irrigation through the dams of Entrepeñas, Buendía, and Bolarque. There are nuclear power plants at Zorita and Trillo.
The provincial capital, Guadalajara city, and the towns of Hita, Sigüenza, and Atienza were important as economic and cultural centres in medieval times, but only Guadalajara is now a major population centre with diverse industries. Molina in the northeast is considered to be Spain’s coldest city. About half the province is unproductive, but sheep raising on the pastures provides a large contribution to the economy. Tourism, based on hunting and fishing, is also important. Cereals are widely grown; olives and grapevines are cultivated. The Alcarria plain in the southwest is noted for its honey. Area 4,715 square miles (12,212 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 224,076.
