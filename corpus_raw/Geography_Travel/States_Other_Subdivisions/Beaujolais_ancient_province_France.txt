Beaujolais,   ancient province of France, of which Beaujeu and Villefranche were successively the capital and which corresponded in area to much of the modern département of Rhône, with a small portion of Loire. Crossed by the mountains of Beaujolais (Monts du Beaujolais) and bounded on the east by the Saône River, it is a fertile region noted for its fine wines, marketed at Belleville.
From the 10th to the 13th century, the seigneurs (lords) of Beaujeu gradually enlarged their possessions into a considerable feudal lordship. Édouard I de Beaujeu, marshal of France, fought at the Battle of Crécy (1346) and perished in the Battle of Ardres in 1351. His son died without issue in 1374 and was succeeded by his cousin Édouard II, who gave his estates of Beaujolais and Dombes to Louis II, Duke de Bourbon, in 1400. In 1531 the province was united to the French crown, but in 1560 King Francis II gave it back to the house of Bourbon-Montpensier, from which it passed to that of Orléans. The title Count (comte) de Beaujolais was borne by Louis-Charles d’Orléans, youngest son of Philippe Egalité.
