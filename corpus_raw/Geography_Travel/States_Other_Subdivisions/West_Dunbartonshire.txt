West Dunbartonshire,  council area, west-central Scotland, along the north bank of the lower River Clyde, northwest of Glasgow. It extends north to the shore of Loch Lomond, Scotland’s largest lake, and encompasses an area of lowlands surrounding the Kilpatrick Hills, which stand in the centre of the council area. West Dunbartonshire lies entirely within the historic county of Dunbartonshire.
Most of the population lives in the council area’s three large towns—Alexandria, Dumbarton, and Clydebank—which lie in the south and west. The rural areas, mainly in the north and east, produce sheep on the higher land and dairy products, vegetables, pigs, and poultry in the lower areas. The Kilpatrick Hills serve as a water catchment area for the Glasgow metropolitan area. The council area’s economy, once reliant on heavy industry, now largely depends on public services, retail, and waterfront tourism. In the southeast, Clydebank, the largest town, suffered severely from the virtual collapse of its historic shipbuilding and heavy engineering industries in the decades after World War II. The shipyard responsible for the great Cunard liners, culminating with the Queen Elizabeth II (1967), transitioned to manufacturing offshore oil-drilling rigs and related equipment until operations ceased completely in 2001. Dumbarton, another historic shipbuilding area, along the Clyde to the northwest, is the council area’s administrative centre, and Alexandria, near Loch Lomond, supports tourism and whisky distilling. Area 61 square miles (159 square km). Pop. (2001) 93,378; (2011) 90,720.
