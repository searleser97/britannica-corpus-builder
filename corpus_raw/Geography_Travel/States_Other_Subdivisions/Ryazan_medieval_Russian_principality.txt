Ryazan,   medieval Russian principality from the 12th to the early 16th century. Ryazan became an independent princedom early in the 12th century under Yaroslav, the son of the grand prince Svyatoslav of Kiev. Its capital city was Old Ryazan on the Oka River, about 150 miles (240 km) southeast of Moscow. For the next century it was often in conflict with the principality of Vladimir, which was subsequently absorbed by Moscow. In 1237 a Mongol army of the Golden Horde under Batu Khan attacked and razed Old Ryazan, after which the restored princedomâ€™s capital was established at Pereyaslavl-Ryazansky, about 30 miles (48 km) upstream on the Oka. The princes of Ryazan were able to resist Moscow and even temporarily extend their territory in the late 14th century through the support of the Golden Horde. By the early 15th century, however, Ryazan had become politically dependent on Moscow, which formally annexed it in 1521.
