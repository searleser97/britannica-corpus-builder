Rushmoor,  borough (district), administrative and historic county of Hampshire, southern England. Occupying part of the extreme northeastern corner of the county, Rushmoor is situated at the southern edge of the River Thames basin, and its rural areas are sandy heathland. The chalk uplands of the North Downs border the district on the south, and the Basingstoke Canal bisects it east-west. Farnsborough is the administrative centre.
The district is a major centre of the United Kingdom’s military establishment. A military camp established at the town of Aldershot in 1854–55 is now the largest permanent military base in the country. Adjacent to Farnborough and lying to the north of the canal is the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which since 1906 has been the United Kingdom’s chief centre for scientific research and experimental development in aeronautics. In 1908 an American aviator, S.F. Cody, made the first powered flight in Great Britain at Farnborough. Both Aldershot and Farnborough were expanded and redeveloped during the 1960s and ’70s. They manufacture paper products, cables, and synthetic rubber. Farnborough Hill, a gabled and turreted house built in 1862, was inhabited by Eugénie, the exiled empress of France (1853–70), from 1881 until her death in 1920. Area 15 square miles (39 square km). Pop. (2001) 90,952; (2011 prelim.) 93,800.
