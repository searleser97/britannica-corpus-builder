Torridge,  district in the northwestern part of the administrative and historic county of Devon, southwestern England. It is located on the Bristol Channel, with its eastern boundary at the mouth of the River Torridge, the site of Bideford, its main town and administrative centre.
The geology of the district is dominated by the Culm Measures, dark gray shale with intercollated bands of sandstones and grits. The rocks have been folded along an east-west alignment followed by a number of rivers. The main river, the Torridge, flows from south to north between steep forested slopes; its valley is deep but broad, with a wide floodplain that provides excellent meadow and pasture. Dairying is important, together with the rearing of beef cattle and sheep. Fodder crops include barley, roots, and ley grass. There are substantial markets at Bideford, Holsworthy, and Great Torrington.
The coastline has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and annually attracts many tourists. The Culm Measures outcrop to form magnificent cliffs from Hartland Point eastward to Westward Ho! near the mouth of the Torridge. Related to Charles Kingsleyâ€™s novel of the same name, Westward Ho! has developed as a major coastal resort. North of it is a stretch of sand dunes called Northam Burrows. Clovelly is an old fishing port, and shipbuilding thrives at Appledore and Bideford.
In response to the problems of comparative isolation and limited employment, Torridge was included within the South West Development Area. Since 1970 many new light industries have been introduced. Area 380 square miles (985 square km). Pop. (2001) 58,965; (2011) 63,839.
