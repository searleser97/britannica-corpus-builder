Guadalupe,  county, central New Mexico, U.S., an arid plains area dotted with hills and red mesas and marked by a few arroyos. The county lies mostly in the Pecos River valley, rising in the east to a High Plains region. The Pecos makes an irregular curve through the county from northwest to south, exiting at Sumner Lake. Santa Rosa Lake is an impoundment on the Pecos at Los Esteros Dam. Santa Rosa Lake State Park and part of Sumner Lake State Park are within the county’s borders.
The Spanish explorer Francisco Vázquez de Coronado is said to have built a bridge across the Pecos at Puerto de Luna during his 1540 expedition. Despite resistance by Navajo Indians, whites settled permanently in the region in the 1860s, and the county was established in 1891. The junction of the Rock Island and Southern Pacific railroads at the town of Santa Rosa in the early 20th century and the building of U.S. Route 66 across the county in the 1930s stimulated development.
The raising of cattle and sheep has long been the basis of Guadalupe county’s economy; tourism is also important. Santa Rosa is the county seat. Area 3,030 square miles (7,847 square km). Pop. (2000) 4,680; (2010) 4,687.
