Sevilla, conventional Seville,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Andalusia, southwestern Spain. The province comprises the lower Guadalquivir River valley and has varied relief. It is bordered by the Morena Mountains to the northwest and by the Sub-Baetic ranges of the Algodonales and Caballo mountains to the south and southeast. Between these ranges is the low, undulating surface (campiñas) of the Guadalquivir trough.
Below Sevilla city, the provincial capital, the navigable Guadalquivir River forms the marshy plains of Las Marismas before entering the Atlantic Ocean. These plains are the haunt of wildfowl; bulls are pastured there, and land-reclamation projects have long been in progress. Most of the land is contained in Coto Doñana National Park.
On the fertile campiñas, olives, wheat, rice, cotton, sugar beets, and oranges are cultivated on large estates. The raising of sheep and goats is also a significant component of the local economy. The agricultural population along the northern course of the Guadalquivir is scattered among numerous small towns, many on ancient Roman sites, around which horticulture is practiced on small holdings, all somewhat isolated from main routes of communication. Together with its agricultural wealth, the province yields copper, iron ore, and coal. Food processing and the production of automotive parts, metals, and textiles are considerable sources of income. The service industry (especially tourism) has grown in importance. The main population centres, apart from Sevilla, are Écija, Carmona, Marchena, Utrera, Morón de la Frontera, and Osuna. Area 5,419 square miles (14,036 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 1,849,268.
