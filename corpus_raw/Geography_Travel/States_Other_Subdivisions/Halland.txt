Halland,  län (county) of southern Sweden, coextensive with the traditional landskap (province) of Halland. It is a low undulating region of heaths and ridges that rise above gently sloping sandy beaches. The coastline is smooth with few anchorages. Four rivers—the Viskan, Ätran, Nissan, and Lagan, famous for their salmon and long harnessed for hydroelectricity—cross the county. Originally part of Denmark, the region was ceded to Sweden in 1645 after having been conquered by Charles X.
Rye, oats, and sugar beets are grown in the county and there are brick, tile, and engineering works. Halmstad, the capital, and several other cities in the county are of medieval origin. Halland’s beaches and recreational areas make tourism a vital part of its economy. Arguably the county’s biggest attraction is Gekås Ullared, a discount superstore located in the village of Ullared, which is among the largest of its kind in Europe and which annually draws millions of shoppers. Area museums include Halland Art Museum in Halmstad; the Falkenbergs Museum, which is dedicated to Swedish and international design; and Svedino’s Automobile and Aviation Museum, near the village of Ugglarp.
Area 2,208 square miles (5,719 square km). Pop. (2005 est.) 285,868; (2010 est.) 299,484.
