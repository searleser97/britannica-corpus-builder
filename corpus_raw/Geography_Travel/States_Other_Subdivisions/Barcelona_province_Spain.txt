Barcelona,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Catalonia, northeastern Spain. It was formed in 1833. The province follows the axis of the Llobregat River basin, from which its regions are symmetrically arranged. No province has a more diverse landscape; it is a cross section of many varied geological zones, namely, the Pyrenees, the scarps and basins of the interior of Catalonia, the littoral ranges, the central depression, the coastal ranges, and the coastal plains.
The economy is as varied as the landscape. In the mountainous northern tableland near Berga, lignite is mined, and cement, of which the province is one of Spain’s leading producers, is manufactured. Southwest, in the Cardona Valley, salt has been exploited since Roman times, and there are important potash deposits (discovered in 1912) near Suria. The fertile plains of Vic and Barcelona yield grapes, as does the area around Villafranca, in the south. Grains are cultivated throughout the central depression. The coastal plain area around the Llobregat river delta is under intensive cultivation. Tourism is a prominent economic activity because of the province’s mild climate, Mediterranean beaches, and cultural venues.
Barcelona is one of Spain’s premier manufacturing centres, and provincial capital Barcelona city is also the chief seaport. The city produces more than three-fourths of the textile, paper, and plastic manufactures and a high proportion of the output of the chemical, automotive, and engineering industries. Exports include table and sparkling wines and manufactured goods. The province has used the hydroelectric power sources of the Pyrenees and its strategic location to its advantage. A high-speed train runs from Barcelona city to Madrid city. There is an airport in the province. Area 2,984 square miles (7,728 square km). Pop. (2011) 5,522,566.
