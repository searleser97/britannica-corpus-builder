Tandridge,  district, administrative and historic county of Surrey, southeastern England. It occupies southeastern Surrey and borders Greater London to the north, Kent to the east, and Sussex to the south. Oxted, in the east-central part of the district, is the administrative centre.
Tandridge lies within easy commuting distance of central London and has excellent road and rail communications with the city. Urban expansion into the district has, nevertheless, been limited by the rugged terrain; the chalk heights of the North Downs cross Tandridge in the north, and in the south is a sandstone ridge. Much woodland remains on the slopes, and there is still some arable farming. Area 96 square miles (250 square km). Pop. (2001) 79,267; (2011) 82,998.
