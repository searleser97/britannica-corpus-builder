Utrecht,  provincie, central Netherlands, the country’s smallest, with an area of 514 square miles (1,331 square km). It extends southward from the narrow Lake Eem, which separates Utrecht provincie from the South Flevoland polder of Flevoland provincie. Utrecht provincie lies between the provincies of Noord-Holland and Zuid-Holland (west) and Gelderland (east). Its history is closely linked with that of the city of Utrecht, its capital.
The provincie is drained by the Lower Rijn (Rhine), Kromme (Winding, or Crooked) Rijn, Lek, Vecht, and Eem rivers. The sandy soil of its hilly eastern part supports pig and poultry raising and horticulture around Amersfoort and Utrecht. The low-peat areas of the northwest have a few polders and lakes where much peat was cut and where dairy farming is now important. River clay found in the southwest, deposited by the Rijn, IJssel, and other rivers, supports fruit growing and market gardening. Utrecht, the largest city, and Amersfoort are the only sizable industrial communities; but there is light manufacturing in smaller towns such as Zeist, Veenendaal, and Maarssen. The provincie’s northern part mostly comprises the resort and residential region known as the Gooi, whereas the region between Utrecht city and Amersfoort is pleasantly wooded.
Utrecht has many fine old castles and manor houses founded by wealthy Amsterdam merchants in the “Golden Age” (1650–1720). Near Baarn in the village of Soestdijk is former queen Juliana’s royal residence. Pop. (2007 est.) 1,190,604.
