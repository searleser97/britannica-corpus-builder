Adygeya, also spelled Adygea,  republic, southwestern Russia. It extends from the Kuban River south to the Caucasus foothills. Adygeya was established as an oblast (province) in 1922 for the Adyghian people, one of two major branches of the Circassians (Cherkess), who make up about one-fifth of its total population. Apart from the foothills in the south, which are covered in deciduous forest, most of Adygeya is an undulating plain with rich soils that are used almost wholly for agriculture. Corn (maize), wheat, sunflowers, hemp, tobacco, melons, potatoes, and other vegetables are grown. A local specialty is flowers, especially Crimean roses and lavender, grown for scent. On the marshy floodplain along the Kuban River, some 20,000 acres (8,000 hectares) have been reclaimed for market gardening. Adygeyaâ€™s industry is chiefly concerned with processing farm produce, but oil and natural gas are exploited near Maykop, the administrative centre of the republic. There is some timbering in the south. Area 2,900 square miles (7,600 square km). Pop. (2008 est.) 441,176.
