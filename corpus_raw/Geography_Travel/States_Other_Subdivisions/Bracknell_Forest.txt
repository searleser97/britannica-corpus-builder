Bracknell Forest,  unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Berkshire, southern England. It is partly forested, has easy access to London, and is administered from the town of Bracknell.
Old Bracknell town was unimportant until the 19th century, when its cattle market replaced one at Wokingham that dated from the early 13th century. The population was about 5,000 when the new town of Bracknell was designated in 1949; an influx of industry followed—including engineering and furniture and clothing manufacture—drawing workers to the entire area, including neighbouring towns. Bracknell’s special status as a new town ended in 1982. The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, established for the training of military officers, is located near Sandhurst at Camberley, Surrey, adjacent to the extreme southern part of the unitary authority.
