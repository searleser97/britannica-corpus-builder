Renison Bell,  tin-mining district, northwestern Tasmania, Australia. Tin was found there by prospector George Renison Bell in 1890. Mining began in 1905 but was intermittent because of fluctuations in the price of tin. The deposits were nearly exhausted by the early 1920s. In 1965, after rich new deposits were discovered, the workings of both underground and open-cut mining were expanded. Following a period of declining reserves, falling tin prices, and maintenance and safety issues, the districtâ€™s major mine closed in 2003. The Renison Bell mine and its processing facility were refurbished and reopened under new ownership in 2005.
