A Coruña, Spanish La Coruña,  provincia (province) in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Galicia, northwestern Spain. It was formed in 1833 from part of the captaincy general and former kingdom of Galicia. Bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Cantabrian Sea to the north, it has the highest rainfall of any Spanish province. Its interior is crossed by the Galician mountains; the coastline, rocky and with deep indentations, is formed by drowned valleys or inlets known as rías, such as Santa María de Ortigueira, Ferrol, A Coruña, Corcubión, Muros, and Arousa, all of which afford sites for sheltered ports. Cape Fisterra (known to the Romans as Promunturium Nerium) is a huge granitic mass on the Atlantic coast and is one of Europe’s chief headlands.
A Coruña’s main economic activity is fishing and fish processing, much of which, along with other light industry, is concentrated around the provincial capital of A Coruña. The principal ports are A Coruña and Ferrol. Petroleum refining also is important. There are metallurgical plants and dockyards at Ferrol. Grain, fruit, potatoes, and vegetables are cultivated, and livestock raising, lumbering, and limited mining (tin, copper, and lignite) are carried on. The chief inland city is Santiago de Compostela, a prominent cathedral city that dates from the Middle Ages. Area 3,070 square miles (7,950 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 1,132,792.
