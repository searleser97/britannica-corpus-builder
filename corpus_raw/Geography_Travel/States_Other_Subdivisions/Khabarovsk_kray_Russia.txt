Khabarovsk, also spelled Chabarovsk,  kray (region), far eastern Russia. The kray includes the Yevreyskaya (Jewish) autonomous oblast (province). Its focus is the basin of the lower Amur River, flanked by the Sikhote-Alin mountains (south) and by the complex of mountains (north) dominated by the Bureya Range and a series of long, parallel ranges fronting the Sea of Okhotsk, known collectively as the Dzhugdzhur mountains. Almost the entire kray is in dense swampy forest, or taiga, of larch, spruce, and fir, though in the extreme south some deciduous trees occur. The population is overwhelmingly of Russian settler origin, with small numbers of Jews and indigenous groups: Nanais, Evenks, Ulchi, Nivkhs (Gilyaks), and Orochi. The kray is rich in minerals, including coal, iron ore, manganese, tin, gold, molybdenum, and tungsten. The main sectors of the economy are timber working in the Amur Basin, seal hunting and fishing on the coast, tin production in the Solnechny mining area, and metallurgy and petroleum-refining in the two main towns of Khabarovsk, the administrative centre, and Komsomolsk-na-Amure. Agriculture is limited to cultivation of wheat, soybeans, oats, and vegetables in the Amur basin. Area 318,375 square miles (824,600 square km). Pop. (2002) 1,436,570; (2006 est.) 1,412,260.
