Falcón,  estado (state), northwestern Venezuela. It is bounded on the north by the Caribbean Sea, west by the Gulf of Venezuela, northwest by Zulia state, and south by Lara and Yaracuy states. It includes the Paraguaná Peninsula.
The coastal region was first explored and mapped in 1499 by Juan de la Cosa and Amerigo Vespucci, who were part of the expedition led by Alonso de Ojeda. The state was named after Juan Crisóstomo Falcón, onetime president of Venezuela (1863–68.) Consisting primarily of coastal lowlands and northern Andean outliers, the territory is dry and agriculturally poor.
Fishing is as an important economic activity. Farming is generally restricted to river valleys and mountain terraces; crops such as corn (maize), coconuts, onions, sorghum, potatoes, bananas, melons, sugarcane, and coffee are grown. Goat raising is widespread, but the higher elevations have been denuded by overgrazing and deforestation. In contrast, the Paraguaná Peninsula and the area around the state capital, Coro, have experienced rapid industrialization and growth, and huge oil refineries–most notably those at Amuay and Cardón—are situated on the southwestern shore of the peninsula. A large portion of  Venezuela’s oil output is refined in Falcón and then exported by tanker. Northern Falcón, including the peninsula, is well served by highways. In 1993 Coro was designated as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO. Area 9,575 square miles (24,800 square km). Pop. (2001) 763,188; (2011) 902,847.
