Katsina,  state, north-central Nigeria. It was formed from the northern half of Kaduna state in 1987. Katsina is bordered by the Republic of Niger to the north and by the Nigerian states of Jigawa and Kano to the east, Kaduna to the south, and Zamfara to the west.
The state consists largely of scrub vegetation with some wooded savanna in the south. It is mainly inhabited by Muslim Hausa (the Katsena [Katsenawa], Kano [Kanawa], and Bugaje branches) and Fulani peoples and by a few Maguzawas (animistic Hausas). Farming is the chief occupation; peanuts (groundnuts) are the main cash crop, but cotton is important in the south. Millet and sorghum are grown as staple foods, and there is vegetable gardening in riverine floodplains. Most of its peoples own cattle, sheep, or goats, and hides and skins are sold for profit. Katsina town is the state capital and largest settlement; it has a steel-rolling mill and a polytechnic college. The state is served by the main highway between Kano and Maradi (Niger).
