Penwith,  former district, Cornwall unitary authority, extreme southwestern England. It is a promontory, including the Land’s End peninsula at the westernmost tip of the island of Great Britain, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the English Channel to the south.
Penwith has contrasting landscapes. As in much of Cornwall, the physiography alternates between moorlands of igneous-based (granite) intrusives and sedimentary-based valleys, such as the Hayle Valley in the east. Assorted prehistoric remains, including cromlechs (stone circles) dating from 2000–1600 bce, are found in the moorlands. Land’s End includes windswept moorlands 600 to 800 feet (185 to 245 metres) high, with bold and rugged cliffs along its northern shore that descend in the south into protected coves and headlands with rich vegetation. Plants normally associated with the subtropics (such as hydrangeas, camellias, and orange trees) thrive in sheltered valleys because of the maritime climate greatly influenced by the North Atlantic Drift.
Dairy cattle are grazed throughout the district, and pigs, beef cattle, poultry, early-season vegetables, and some fruits thrive in the fertile Hayle Valley. The larger coastal resorts of Penzance (the district seat), St. Ives, and Land’s End are popular with artists and adventure seekers. The villages of the district have retained an unspoiled appearance. The village of Pendeen, at the northwestern tip of Penwith district, was the site of a small tin mine still operating in the 1980s, exemplifying an industry that was until the late 19th century an economic mainstay of both the district and the county. Pilchard and mackerel are caught offshore by fishermen operating out of Newlyn.
