High Peak,  borough (district), northwestern part of the administrative county of Derbyshire, north-central England. Most of the borough is part of the historic county of Derbyshire, but its northern edge includes Tintwhistle and the north side of Langdendale, which belong to the historic county of Cheshire. Chapel-en-le-Frith is the administrative centre.
The borough occupies an upland area between the densely populated metropolitan areas of Greater Manchester (west) and South Yorkshire (east). The borough’s Kinder Scout (or The Peak) has an elevation of 2,088 feet (636 metres), the highest in the southern Pennines, which form the upland “spine” of England. Except for valleys along its western border, the borough lies within Peak District National Park. The flat-topped, bleak, hard sandstone moorlands in the north and east are underlain by limestone bedrock, which is exposed in the denuded plateau-and-valley region of the southwest.
Clusters of towns industrially associated with Greater Manchester’s cotton-milling industries are centred on Glossop and New Mills in the extreme west. Limestone quarrying is important around Buxton, a spa dating from Roman times, in the southwest; potter’s clay and blue john (a kind of fluorspar) are also mined. The rough grazing of sheep occurs throughout the borough. Tourists visit the region for rock climbing, grouse hunting, and exploring caverns. Area 208 square miles (539 square km). Pop. (2001) 89,433; (2011) 90,892.
