The region was inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Indians when Europeans began settling Carolina in the 1670s. Orangeburg township, named for William IV, prince of Orange, was among the original areas planned for settlement in South Carolina’s plan of 1731. The region’s loamy soils first attracted German and Swiss farmers as settlers; they were followed by Low Country plantation owners and their slaves. The county was established in 1785. During the American Civil War it was captured by Union forces led by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in 1865.
