Voronezh, also spelled Voronež,  oblast (region), western Russia. The oblast lies in the basin of the middle Don River, which bisects it north–south. The northeastern part of the oblast consists of the level Oka–Don Plain; west of the Don the land rises to the Central Russian Upland, which is greatly dissected by valleys and erosion gullies. The oblast lies in the forest-steppe zone, with a natural vegetation of alternating patches of oak forest and grass steppe. The greater part of the natural plant cover has disappeared owing to cultivation, since the soils are exceptionally rich. The surviving oak forest is protected in nature reserves. Plowing has caused intensive soil erosion in the oblast, and countermeasures are relatively limited. Nevertheless, the oblast is highly developed agriculturally, dominated by the cultivation of wheat, corn (maize), and other grains; it is one of the few areas of Russia that provides adequate climatic conditions for corn. Sunflowers and sugar beets are the chief industrial crops. Vegetables, especially potatoes, are important around Voronezh, the oblast headquarters, and orchards abound. Dairy and beef cattle, pigs, and sheep are kept in large numbers. Except in Voronezh city, most industry is small in scale, processing farm produce. There are some low-grade iron-ore deposits. Area 20,250 square miles (52,400 square km). Pop. (2006 est.) 2,313,648.
