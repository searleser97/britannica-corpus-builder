The Hudson, which bisects the county north-south, is the main drainage system. Other waterways include the Schroon River and Brant, Loon, and Friends lakes. The county is almost entirely occupied by Adirondack Park (1892), which is one of the largest parks in the United States and the nation’s first forest preserve. The region is heavily wooded with conifers such as pine, spruce, and fir.
Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk Indians probably hunted in the region. The resort village of Lake George, the county seat, was the site of a battle (September 8, 1755) during the French and Indian War and of Fort William Henry (1756–57), which has been reconstructed. In the 19th century the city of Glens Falls was successively a centre of lumbering, limestone processing, paper milling, and textile manufacturing. Other communities are Warrensburg and Lake Luzerne.
