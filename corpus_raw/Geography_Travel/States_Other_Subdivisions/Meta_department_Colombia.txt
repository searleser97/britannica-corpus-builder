Meta,  departamento, eastern Colombia, bounded north by the Río Meta and south by the Río Guaviare. Created in 1959, it consists of lowlands, except for the Serranía (mountains) de La Macarena in the southwest and the Andean Cordillera (mountains) Oriental in the west. Agriculture is concentrated on the lower mountain slopes, where grains, oilseeds, coffee, and other crops are cultivated. The cattle industry is well developed, and mineral deposits include coal and salt.
Industrial and commercial activity is centred on Villavicencio, the departmental capital, whose chief industries are a brewery, a distillery, saddleries, soap factories, and coffee-roasting plants. A highway descends from Bogotá to Villavicencio; one branch then leads east-northeast along the Río Meta, and another runs southeast through the department. Air and river travel predominate in eastern Meta. Area 33,064 square miles (85,635 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 817,857.
