Wakayama,  ken (prefecture), west-central Honshu, Japan. It occupies the southwestern and southern portions of the Kii Peninsula, which faces the Kii Strait (west) and the Pacific Ocean (south). Wakayama city, on the Kii Strait, is the prefectural capital.
Most of the prefecture’s area is mountainous and broken by deep river valleys, such as the Toro Gorge on the Kumano River. Despite frequent typhoons in summer, the climate is mild, and the coastal plain and some large valleys are rich agricultural regions. Fishing for tuna, bonito, mackerel, and sardines has been carried on along the coast since early historic times. Industrialization is confined largely to the northwest, where the city of Wakayama and neighbouring Kainan are part of the Keihanshin Industrial Zone. Those cities’ major products include petrochemicals, textiles, iron, and steel. A thermoelectric plant began operation near Kainan during the early 1970s.
