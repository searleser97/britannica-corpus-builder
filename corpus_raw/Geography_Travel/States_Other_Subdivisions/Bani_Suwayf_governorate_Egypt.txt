Banī Suwayf,  muḥāfaẓah (governorate), lying along the Nile River in northern Upper Egypt, with an extension into the Libyan (Western) Desert at its southern end. Al-Fayyūm governorate lies to the west and north and Al-Minyā to the south. Its cultivated, settled area consists mainly of a strip of the Nile River valley floodplain, extending about 50 miles (80 km) north-south and 15 miles in width at its widest point, near Banī Suwayf city. Because the river throughout history has eroded away the eastern bank, it now embraces only a narrow gravelly plain terminating abruptly below the bluffs of the Eastern Desert. In 1964 Banī Suwayf governorate pioneered a nationally supervised cooperative-farming scheme in which scattered land holdings were consolidated into large units. Cotton, grains, beans, and sugarcane are the principal crops, and chickens and pigeons are also raised. The capital, Banī Suwayf, is a regional market. In the Eastern Desert alabaster is quarried, and there are iron-ore deposits in the desert to the west.
Among the governorate’s antiquities are the 3rd-dynasty (c. 2650–c. 2575 bce) pyramid of Huni at Maydūm, and the ruins of ancient Heracleopolis lie near the village of Ihnāsiyat al-Madīnah, west of Banī Suwayf city near the Baḥr Yūsuf, an irrigation canal, which turns north of the site into Al-Fayyūm governorate. The Cairo–Aswān railway stops at Banī Suwayf city, from where a branch runs into Al-Fayyūm. Area 510 square miles (1,322 square km). Pop. (2006) 2,291,618.
