East Dorset,  district, administrative county of Dorset, southern England. It is located in the northeastern corner of the county directly north of the English Channel resorts of Bournemouth and Poole. The old parish (town) of Wimborne Minster is the administrative centre.
Most of the district is part of the historic county of Dorset, but its easternmost section, including St. Leonards, is in the historic county of Hampshire. East Dorset district is a low-lying plain descending from the southerly slopes of Cranborne Chase, a chalk ridge to the northwest. Dairy cattle and cereals (particularly barley) are raised on the generally fertile soils of Cranborne Chase; the infertile sand-and-clay terrain farther southeast is given over to rough pasturage, heath, or woodland. Residential growth, extending north from Bournemouth and Poole onto the heathland of the extreme east and south, has occurred at West Moors, Ferndown, and farther west at Wimborne Minster.
Wimborne Minster is located in the middle of a market gardening area for fruits and vegetables; watercress is harvested locally. The Badbury Rings 4 miles (6 km) northwest of the town are an ancient Iron Age fortification consisting of three concentric trenches that enclose a wooded hilltop. The Romans evidently used the rings as a juncture point for their road system. Area 137 square miles (355 square km). Pop. (2001) 83,786; (2011) 87,166.
