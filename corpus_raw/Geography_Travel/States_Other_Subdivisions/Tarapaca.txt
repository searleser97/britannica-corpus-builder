Tarapacá,  historic region, northern Chile, bordering Peru and Bolivia to the north and east and fronting the Pacific Ocean to the west. Tarapacá was ceded to Chile by Peru after the War of the Pacific (1879–83). Part of the Atacama Desert, it is without water except at the base of the Andes, where ephemeral streams are lost in the sands. In some places, however, there are oases with vegetation and water enough to support small settlements.
Tarapacá was sparsely populated until the 19th-century desert nitrate boom. Deposits are found on the Pampa de Tamarugal, a broad, desert plateau about 3,000 ft (910 m) above sea level between the coastal range and the Andes. Since 1940, however, unfavourable world markets for nitrates have resulted in a decline in their production. The regional economy is now based largely on fishing and fish processing and agriculture. New irrigation projects have opened lands for the cultivation of olives, citrus fruits, and alfalfa. The Pan-American Highway runs the length of the region, and “nitrate” railways run inland from the main ports of Arica (a free port for Bolivia) and Iquique (q.v.).
