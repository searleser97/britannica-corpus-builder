Keewatin,  region, southwestern Nunavut territory, Canada. Keewatin, formerly part of the Keewatin and eastern Mackenzie districts, was created a region of the Northwest Territories in the early 1970s. In April 1999 it became part of the newly created territory of Nunavut. The region extends from the borders of eastern Northwest Territories and northern Manitoba to the southern border of Kitikmeot region, just above the Arctic Circle. It adjoins Baffin region to the northeast. Keewatin consists of the northwest coast of Hudson Bay; Southampton, Coats, and several other islands in the northwestern part of Hudson Bay; and territory stretching inland as far west as the Thelon River. The region, its name derived from the Cree Indian word for “north wind,” is almost entirely within the Canadian Shield—a physiographic area of rocky, ice-smoothed hills and irregular basins mostly filled by lakes and swamps—and is largely a permafrost zone with Arctic tundra vegetation. The major settlements (Arviat, Baker Lake [Qamanittuaq], and Rankin Inlet [Kangiqtinq; the regional headquarters]), are economically dependent upon fur trapping, sealing, copper and gold mining, and handicrafts. The population is mostly Inuit. Pop. (2006) 8,348; (2011) 8,348.
