Girona, Spanish Gerona,  provincia (province) in the Catalonia comunidad autónoma (autonomous community), northeastern Spain. Girona is the northeasternmost province of the autonomous community and of Spain. It is bounded by France and the Pyrenees to the north, by the Mediterranean Sea to the east and southeast, and by Barcelona and Lleida provinces to the west. Girona province was formed in 1883 from parts of Catalonia. Historically, the province acted as the guardian of the passes through the eastern end of the Pyrenees.
The province’s colder northern sector has a well-developed forest industry (oak, pine, and chestnut). Its eastern and southern fertile coastal plain of El Ampurdán, drained by the Ter, Muga, and Fluviá rivers, produces cereals, corn (maize), and fodder. Fishing also is economically important. Manufactures of textiles (linen and cotton), foodstuffs, paper, and electronics are concentrated in Girona city, the capital of the province, and the export-oriented cork industry flourishes at San Felíu de Guixols and Palafrugell. Tourism is important along the coast, which is known as the Costa Brava, and services have become one of the most important economic activities of the province. Cape Creus, a marked feature of the coastline, is the most easterly point of the Iberian Peninsula. Area 2,282 square miles (5,910 square km). Pop. (2007 est.) 706,185.
