Cuu Long,  former tinh (province) of southern Vietnam. Located in the Mekong River delta region, it was created in 1976 from the former provinces of Vinh Long and Vinh Binh, but in the early 1990s it was divided again into the provinces of Tra Vinh and Vinh Long. The region is bounded to the north by the Tien Giang River, to the northeast by the Co Chien River, and to the southwest by the Hau Giang (Bassac) River, all branches of the Mekong. The Tien Giang, the main branch of the Mekong, further divides into the three main streams of the delta proper at the city of Vinh Long. To the southeast the region is bounded by the South China Sea.
The flat alluvial lowland, subject to the summer monsoonal flooding of the Mekong, has rice paddies except along the coastal mangrove swamps. Near the coast, fishing and fish farming are important economic activities; the yield annually supplies fish to other parts of Vietnam. Vung Liem, 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Vinh Long, is a rice centre. Other activities include coconut raising, sawmilling, and distilling. Besides the extensive network of canals and arroyos, there are two large river ports, Cua Cung Hau and Cua Song Hau. The Cuu Long region was formerly a district of Cambodia, but in 1731 the area passed to the Vietnamese. The population includes Vietnamese and Khmer.
