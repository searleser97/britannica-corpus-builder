Sumter,  county, central South Carolina, U.S. It is bordered to the west by the Wateree River, which flows into the Congaree River; the narrow far eastern border is the Lynches River. The county is also drained by the Black and Pocotaligo rivers. Shaw Air Force Base, Manchester State Forest, Poinsett State Park, and Woods Bay State Park (in a Carolina bay, or isolated swampy area) are all located there. Sumter county is an agricultural region situated both on low Fall Line hills and on a flat, often swampy area of the inner Coastal Plain.
The Wateree Indians, a small Siouan-speaking tribe, inhabited the region in the 17th century. By the time of the American Revolution, European settlers had replaced its forests with farms; the county continues to be a leading source of cotton, tobacco, grains, legumes, and livestock. Gen. Thomas Sumter, for whom the county was named, founded the town of Stateburg and in 1786 promoted it for the future state capital. Sumter county was established in 1785 (though it did not take its present boundaries until 1902) with the town of Sumter as the seat.
Agriculture and manufacturing (food, textiles, furniture, and fabricated metal products) are the mainstays of the economy. Area 666 square miles (1,724 square km). Pop. (2000) 104,687; (2010) 107,456.
