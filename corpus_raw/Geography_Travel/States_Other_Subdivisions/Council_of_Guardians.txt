Council of Guardians, also called Guardian Council, Persian Shūrā-ye Negahbān,  in Iranian government, a council empowered to vet legislation and oversee elections.
The 12-member Council of Guardians is a body of jurists that acts in many ways as an upper legislative house. Half its members are specialists in Islamic canon law appointed by the country’s rahbar, or supreme leader, and the other half are civil jurists nominated by the Supreme Judicial Council and appointed by the Majles (parliament). The Council of Guardians reviews all legislation passed by the Majles to determine its constitutionality. If a majority of the council does not find a piece of legislation in compliance with the constitution or if a majority of the council’s Islamic canon lawyers find the document to be contrary to the standards of Islamic law, then the council may strike it down or return it with revisions to the Majles for reconsideration. In addition, the council supervises elections, and all candidates standing for election—even for the presidency—must meet with its prior approval.
