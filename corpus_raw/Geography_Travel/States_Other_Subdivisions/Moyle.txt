Moyle,  former district (1973–2015) within the former County Antrim, now in Causeway Coast and Glens district, northern Northern Ireland. Situated along the northern coast of Ireland, Moyle included Rathlin Island, Northern Ireland’s only populated island, and had 42 miles (68 km) of bays, headlands, and sheer basalt cliffs dissected by wooded glens. The Antrim Mountains extend through the eastern portion of Moyle, reaching an elevation of 1,817 feet (554 metres) at Trostan Mountain and descending to high rolling moors in the west. The area derived its name from “the Straits of Moyle,” an old name for the channel between Northern Ireland and Scotland. A cave on Rathlin Island 3 miles (5 km) north of the mainland is said to have been the hiding place of the Scots-Irish leader Robert the Bruce in 1306. In 1898 Guglielmo Marconi tested his wireless system between a Rathlin Island lighthouse and the town of Ballycastle.
Potatoes, oats, barley, and livestock (mostly sheep) are produced in Moyle, but the most important industry is tourism. Other industry has been distinctly limited because of the strict planning policies governing the areas of “outstanding natural beauty.” Two of the best-known physical features of Northern Ireland—the Giant’s Causeway, comprising some 40,000 mostly hexagonal-shaped basalt columns along the coastal cliffs, and five of the nine Glens of Antrim—are there. Ballycastle, a fishing harbour and popular resort town, is located on Ballycastle Bay. Limestone is quarried in the west, and Bushmills town, located on the western edge of Moyle, has an old distillery of Irish whiskey. Area former district, 191 square miles (494 square km).
