Nelson,  port city and unitary authority, northern South Island, New Zealand. It is located on an inlet at the head of Tasman Bay, at the mouth of the Matai River.
It was settled by the New Zealand Company in 1842 and named for British admiral Lord Nelson but was delayed in its development by a Maori attack two years later. It was declared a city and the seat of an Anglican bishopric in 1858, and it prospered during the gold rush of the 1860s.
Nelson is a resort and retirement centre, particularly for people from Wellington, 103 miles (165 km) east, on the other side of Cook Strait. It serves a productive agricultural and livestock region; industries include food-processing plants, sawmills, and engineering works. The port exports tobacco, fruit, timber, and meat and imports petroleum products. In the city are an Anglican cathedral, the Suter Art Gallery (1895; rebuilt 1978), and the Cawthron Institute (1919), which conducts chemical, biological, and environmental research. Area 171 square miles (444 square km). Pop. (2006) 42,891; (2012 est.) 46,600.
