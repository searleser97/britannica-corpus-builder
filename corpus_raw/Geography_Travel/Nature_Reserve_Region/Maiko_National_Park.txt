Maiko National Park,  reserve in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, about equidistant from Bukavu, in the great Western Rift Valley just south of Lake Kivu, at the Rwandan border, and Kisangani, about 320 miles (515 km) to the northwest, at the great westward bend of the Congo River. The parkâ€™s 4,180-square-mile (10,830-square-kilometre) expanse spans the Oso River and extends north to the Lindi River. Dense equatorial forest characterizes the park. Forest-dwellers include gorillas, elephants, leopards, and okapi. Maiko National Park has not been developed for visitors. The park has been adversely affected by civil strife that began in the late 1990s and continued into the 21st century.
