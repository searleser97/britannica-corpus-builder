Upemba National Park,  park in southeastern Congo (Kinshasa). It was created in 1939 and has an area of 4,529 square miles (11,730 square km). Its northern and western borders touch the Lualaba River and the surrounding lakes and marshlands of the Kamolondo plains. Lake Upemba, an expansion of the Lualaba River, lies largely within the park; it covers approximately 200 square miles (500 square km) and is swampy and overgrown with papyrus. The Lufira River flows from the southeast to join the Lualaba River north of the lake. The forested Kibara Mountains rise to 6,070 feet (1,850 m) in the northeast. The parkâ€™s wildlife includes zebras, antelopes, elephants, buffalo, lions, and aquatic birds.
