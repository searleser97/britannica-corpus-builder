Lapland Nature Reserve, Russian Laplandsky Zapovednik,  natural area set aside for research in the natural sciences in the western part of the Kola Peninsula, northwestern Russia. It lies west of Lake Imandra and has an area of 1,075 square miles (2,784 square km). The reserve was established (1930) mainly to protect the natural habitat of the reindeer. It is in a region of wetlands, lakes, forested plains, and low mountains that average 2,000 to 3,600 feet (600 to 1,100 m) in height; glaciated landforms and exposed crystalline rocks of the Baltic Shield are common.
The Lapland Nature Reserve has a subarctic maritime climate. The region is often buffeted by strong winds. Winters are long, with an average temperature in January of less than 10° F (−12° C), and are marked by deep accumulations of snow. Lake ice may reach 40 inches (100 cm) in thickness. The summers are cool and short, with an average July temperature of 57° F (14° C).
 Most of the reserve’s vegetation is pine, with some reindeer moss and fir; there are also areas of mountain lichen tundra (with willow, rhododendron, and mountain aven) and open forest of downy and silver birch. Wildlife includes reindeer, elk, brown bear, pine marten, otter, and wolverine, and birds such as ptarmigan, golden eagle, osprey, grouse, and the Siberian tit and jay. The muskrat was introduced in 1931, the beaver in 1934, and the American mink, by accident, in 1958. Shortly after the establishment of the park in 1930, the endangered reindeer population began to thrive. By the mid-1960s it was estimated that their population exceeded 12,000, a number that was much greater than the local habitat could support. Lichen pastures were depleted, reindeer became malnourished, and their birth rate slowed considerably. In the early 1970s reindeer began leaving the area, so that by 1982 their population fell to less than 200. Aided by the increase in the reserve’s land area, their numbers again grew to include more than 800 individuals by the latter part of the 20th century.
From 1951 to 1958 the reserve was closed and some of its forests were harvested or burnt, but since that time no economic activity has been permitted under law. No settlements, except for forest guard stations, are allowed, and no roads cross the area. In the winter snowmobiles may traverse it along designated routes only. The reserve is used for scientific research on reindeer, fur-bearing animals, and fish and for studies of environmental pollution. Its area was doubled in 1983, after studies determined that the vegetation and wildlife had been greatly compromised by emissions (sulfur dioxide, nickel, and copper) from a nearby smelter.
