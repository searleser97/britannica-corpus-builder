Haleakala National Park,  area centred on Haleakala Crater, south-central Maui island, Hawaii, U.S. Authorized as a part of Hawaii National Park (now Hawaii Volcanoes National Park) in 1916, Haleakala Crater was redesignated a separate park in 1961. The 47-square-mile (122-square-km) park now includes that volcanic crater, Kipahulu Valley (added 1951), and the pools of the ‘Ohe‘o Gulch area (added 1969) on the eastern slope.
Haleakala (meaning “House of the Sun” in Hawaiian) is a dormant shield volcano with one of the world’s largest volcanic craters. Its rim reaches an elevation of 10,023 feet (3,055 metres) at Red Hill on the southwest. The crater is 7.5 miles (12 km) long and 2.5 miles (4 km) wide and has a circumference of about 20 miles (30 km); its floor is about 2,300 feet (700 metres) below the Haleakala Visitor Center, situated 9,740 feet (2,969 metres) high on the rim. The volcano last erupted about 1790. Reddish cinder cones are scattered across the floor of the crater, together with black lava beds.
The park’s climate ranges from subalpine to subtropical. Petrels, honeycreepers, and the rare nene (Hawaiian goose) inhabit the crater. Silverswords, yuccalike plants that take as long as 50 years to flower once and then die, are found in the park. A diverse collection of trees and other plants, such as the ohia and lobelia, live in the park, many in the biological reserve of the Kipahulu Valley. Introduced plants and animals, including goats and mongooses, are destructive to native species.
The summit is accessible via a paved road, and there are some 30 miles (50 km) of trails inside the crater. Kipahulu Valley has rainforests, waterfalls, and lava, but it is closed to visitors; however, the ‘Ohe‘o (“Seven Sacred”) pools, located near the coast, are open to the public. Two of the park’s visitor centres have exhibits on the area’s cultural and natural history. Stargazing and watching the sunrise are popular activities in the park.
