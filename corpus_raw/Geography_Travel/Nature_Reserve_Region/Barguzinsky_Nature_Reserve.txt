Barguzinsky Nature Reserve,   natural area set aside for research in the natural sciences, extending from the northeastern shore of Lake Baikal to the western slopes of the Barguzinsky Mountains, southeastern Russia. The reserve was established (1916) to protect the habitat of the Barguzin sable and has an area of 650,380 acres (263,200 hectares).

The mountainous section is dissected by glacial cirques and lakes. Vegetation near the shore of Lake Baikal includes larch and rhododendron. At higher elevations there are taigas of cedar, larch, and fir. The upper elevations are dominated by tundra and lichen-covered rocks and cliffs. Wildlife includes pika, Siberian chipmunk, fox, elk, reindeer, brown bear, stoat, weasel, otter, moose, wolverine, Baikal hair seal (abundant along the lake shore), and musk and red deer.
