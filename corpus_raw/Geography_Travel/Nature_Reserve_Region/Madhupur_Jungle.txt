Madhupur Jungle, also called Garh Gazali or Garh Gazau,  forest extending approximately 60 miles (100 km) north-south in east-central Bangladesh. It is a slightly elevated area of older alluvium between the Meghna and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers. A large part of the area has been cleared and is now intensively farmed. The most common tree is the sal (Shorea robusta), a major source of timber and fuel. Bamboo, coconut, and betel nut palms are also cultivated. Some open areas serve as pasture grounds.
