The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust,  centre of the world’s largest collection of waterfowl. It was established in 1946 by Sir Peter Scott on 418 acres (169 hectares) along the River Severn near Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, Eng. Nearly a quarter of the land is fenced off for captive birds and breeding stock; the rest of the refuge is traditional wintering ground for many species of ducks and geese. In addition to accommodating true wildfowl (geese, ducks, and swans), the refuge maintains breeding colonies of four of the six known flamingo species and has a special pavilion for exotic ducks and various small birds. The refuge’s collection numbers nearly 3,000 birds representing about 200 species; its breeding record is excellent. Greatest success has been with the Hawaiian goose, which had almost become extinct in the 1950s. Financial support comes from grants and from public attendance fees.
