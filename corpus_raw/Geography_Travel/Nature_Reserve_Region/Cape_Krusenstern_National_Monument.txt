Cape Krusenstern National Monument,  undeveloped wilderness area in northwestern Alaska, U.S., on the treeless coast of the Chukchi Sea. It is part of a string of national parks, monuments, and preserves north of the Arctic Circle that stretches eastward for hundreds of miles; Noatak National Preserve is about 20 miles (32 km) to the east. Proclaimed a monument in 1978, the area underwent boundary changes in 1980. It covers 1,014 square miles (2,627 square km).
Located along a succession of 114 lateral beach ridges, the monument’s remarkable archaeological sites illustrate the cultural evolution of the Arctic peoples, dating back some 4,000 years and continuing to the present day. Wildlife include seals and other marine mammals, and large numbers of birds nest along the coast. Wildflowers are abundant in summer. Access is principally by float plane from Kotzebue (location of the park’s headquarters) to the southeast.
