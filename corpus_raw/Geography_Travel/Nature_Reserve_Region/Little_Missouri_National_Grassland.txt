Little Missouri National Grassland,  prairie grassland region of western North Dakota, U.S. Created in 1960, it is one of four grassland areas included within the Dakota Prairie Grasslands. It covers an area of more than 1,600 square miles (4,140 square km), making it the largest of the countryâ€™s designated national grasslands. It is divided into two districts: the northern district, headquartered in Watford City, and the southern district, headquartered in Dickinson. Its scattered and oddly shaped parcels of land surround much of Theodore Roosevelt National Park and occupy portions of Billings, Golden Valley, McKenzie, and Slope counties; parts of the western border are defined by the Montana state line, parts of the northern border are defined by the Little Missouri River, and immediately to the east is a reservation of the Three Affiliated Tribes (Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara).
Much of the grassland, which includes midgrass prairie, badlands, buttes, and woody patches along streams, remains in a natural, unaltered condition. The openness of the land allows the almost constant wind to blow virtually unimpeded. Prairie dogs, elk, pronghorn, deer, bighorn sheep, coyotes, jackrabbits, eagles, falcons, pheasants, grouse, and wild turkeys make their home there. Outdoor activities such as hiking, canoeing, fishing, and hunting are available. Archaeological sites related to Native Americans and early pioneers are found throughout the area, as are deposits of aquatic fossils, dinosaur skeletons, and petrified wood. In addition to recreation, the grassland has hundreds of active oil wells and provides grazing land for cattle. The National Grasslands Visitor Center in Wall, South Dakota, features exhibits on the history and plant and animal life of the grasslands.
