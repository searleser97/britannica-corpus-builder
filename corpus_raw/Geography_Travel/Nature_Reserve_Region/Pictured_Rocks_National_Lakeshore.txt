Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore,  colourful sandstone cliffs lining the southern shore of Lake Superior in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, U.S. The area, established in 1966 as the country’s first national lakeshore, extends for some 40 miles (65 km) northeast of the city of Munising and is about 6 miles (10 km) across at its widest point. It comprises a 114-square-mile (296-square-km) landscape of dunes, beaches, lakes, waterfalls, forests, and shoreline.
The area is divided into two zones: the Lakeshore Zone, managed by the U.S. National Park Service, and the Inland Buffer Zone, under mixed federal, state, and private ownership. Pictured Rocks was named for the coloured stains on the cliff faces produced by dripping groundwater containing iron and other minerals. The layers of primarily red and brown sandstone consist of Precambrian, Cambrian, and Ordovician bedrock carved into caves, arches, and fortresslike formations by the combined actions of waves and ice. The cliffs rise 50 to 200 feet (15 to 60 metres) above the shoreline. Most of the land is forested with mixed northern hardwoods, fir, spruce, jack pine, and hemlock; stands of white pine were logged to depletion in the early 1900s. Kettle lakes inland are the remains of melted glaciers. Wildlife includes white-tailed deer, black bears, snowshoe hares, grouse, and ducks and geese.
Ojibwa Indians knew the area as the land of “thunder and the gods,” and it was a setting for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem The Song of Hiawatha. The Pictured Rocks themselves cover about 15 miles (25 km) of the national lakeshore; to the north are the sand-and-pebble Twelvemile Beach, the Au Sable Light Station (1874), and the Grand Sable Banks and Dunes. A maritime museum in Grand Marais, at the lakeshore’s northeastern end, has exhibits on Lake Superior shipwrecks. The North Country National Scenic Trail traverses the lakeshore, and Grand Island National Recreation Area is just offshore to the west.
