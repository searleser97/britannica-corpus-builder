Jewel Cave National Monument,  limestone caverns in southwestern South Dakota, U.S., 15 miles (24 km) west of Custer. Established in 1908, the monument occupies a surface area of 2 square miles (5 square km) in the Black Hills.
The caverns consist of a series of chambers joined by narrow passages. They are noted for their jewel-like calcite crystals, including nailhead and dogtooth spar, which are found throughout the cave. When illuminated, these incrustations sparkle like gems. Stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone, draperies, frostwork, and other limestone formations also are present in the cave. The caves are home to nine species of bats, five of which are permanent residents. Elk, white-tailed deer, coyotes, and birds inhabit the ponderosa pine forest that covers the surface.
The caves were first explored in 1900 by three prospectors, Frank and Albert Michaud and Charles Bush. The Michauds attempted to run it as a tourist attraction until the late 1920s. Systematic exploration of the passageways began in the late 1950s and has continued to the present day. Jewel Cave is now known to be the third-longest cave system in the world, with more than 125 miles (200 km) of explored passages. Guided tours are offered in the main visitor area.
