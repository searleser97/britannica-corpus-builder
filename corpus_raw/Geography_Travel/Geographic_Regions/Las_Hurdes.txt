Las Hurdes,  region in Cáceres provincia (province), in the Extremadura comunidad autónoma (autonomous community), western Spain. The high plateau of Salamanca in the central Cordillera Ridge rises almost imperceptibly to the western ranges of the Sierra de Peña de Francia, which on their southern flank have been fractured and plunge precipitously more than 1,000 feet (300 metres) to the Alagón Basin. These step mountains (which were early deforested and are mostly barren) comprise Las Hurdes, a very poor region that is remote from the rest of the country. The area has a cool climate and heavy annual rainfall of about 40 inches (1,000 mm). Until the 16th century, the three parallel valleys of Las Hurdes were legendary as a home of evil spirits and savage peoples.
The Hurdanos who inhabit the region are thought to have originally been political or religious refugees. They remain distinct and inhabit hamlets on the hard slates of the Sierra de Gata to the southwest. Their meagre economy is based upon stock raising (goats) and subsistence farming, which do not adequately support the region’s population of about 6,000. Since the 20th century, attempts to foster economic and social improvements in the region have been undertaken. Tourism, especially in the larger towns, has increased. Area 180 square miles (470 square km).
