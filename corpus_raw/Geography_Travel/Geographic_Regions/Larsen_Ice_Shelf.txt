Larsen Ice Shelf,  ice shelf in the northwestern Weddell Sea, adjoining the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula and named for Norwegian whaler Captain Carl A. Larsen, who sailed along the ice front in 1893. It originally covered an area of 33,000 square miles (86,000 square km), excluding the numerous small islands within the ice shelf. The shelf was narrow in its southern half but gradually widened toward the Antarctic Circle to the north before narrowing again. After the disintegration of the northern sections of the Larsen Ice Shelf in the late 20th and early 21st centuries and the departure of a large iceberg from one of the southern sections in 2017, some 26,000 square miles (68,000 square km) remained.
As air temperatures over the Antarctic Peninsula warmed slightly in the second half of the 20th century (see global warming), the Larsen Ice Shelf shrank dramatically. In January 1995 the northern portion (known as Larsen A) disintegrated, and a giant iceberg calved from the upper middle section (Larsen B). Larsen B steadily retreated until February–March 2002, when it too collapsed and disintegrated. Only tiny fractions of these sections of the ice shelf remain. These events left the Larsen Ice Shelf covering only 40 percent of its former area.
Approximately 12 percent of the remaining lower middle section of the Larsen Ice Shelf (known as Larsen C) broke away as a single massive iceberg measuring some 2,240 square miles (5,800 square km) in July 2017. The iceberg was the product of a slow-developing rift that progressed northwestward through the shelf. NASA and European Space Agency satellites tracked the rift’s growth between 2012 and 2017. The length of the rift grew from roughly 70 miles (110 km) in August 2016 to more than 125 miles (200 km) at the time of the iceberg’s calving. Scientists were unsure whether the loss of such a large piece of the Larsen C would destabilize the integrity of the shelf in the near term. They noted, however, that several mathematical models had predicted that Larsen C would break up like Larsen A and Larsen B.
