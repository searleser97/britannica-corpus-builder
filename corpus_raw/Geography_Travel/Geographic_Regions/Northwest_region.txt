Northwest, also called Pacific Northwest,  region, northwestern U.S., including the states of Oregon and Washington and part of Idaho.
Originally claimed by Spain, Britain, Russia, and finally the United States, the Northwest was jointly occupied by Britain and the United States until 1846, when the 49th parallel was made the boundary between the United States and British-held Canada. The area had been explored by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1804â€“06 and by various trappers and fur traders, and settlers began arriving there by way of the Oregon Trail in the 1840s. Farming and trapping were the original economic mainstays, to be followed in later years by lumbering, fishing, and mining.
A region of spectacular beauty and valuable natural resources, the Northwest has attracted relatively few immigrants largely because of its basically wet climate. Furthermore, the economy has tended to rely on a few big industries, such as timber, and aeronautics in Washington, so that fluctuations in the business cycle are particularly severe in the region.
Growth rates in the Northwest have been high but generally below those of neighbouring states in the Southwest. Government has tended to be progressive and especially sensitive to environmental issues.
