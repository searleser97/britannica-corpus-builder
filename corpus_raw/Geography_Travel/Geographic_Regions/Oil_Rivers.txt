Oil Rivers,   area comprising the delta of the Niger River in modern Nigeria, West Africa. The Oil Rivers Protectorate was established by the British in 1885. It was renamed the Niger Coast Protectorate in 1893 and in 1900 was joined to the Nigerian territories administered by the British government. Its name derives from the palm oil that was the chief product of the area.
