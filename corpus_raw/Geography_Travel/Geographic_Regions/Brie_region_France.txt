Brie,   natural region of northern France between the Seine and Marne valleys. It occupies most of Seine-et-Marne département and parts of adjacent départements. The region was historically divided between the king of France (the Brie Française) and the duke of Champagne (the Brie Champenoise) from the 9th to the early 13th century, when the crown took it over. Broken here and there by forests, its fertile limon soil produces wheat and sugar beets, and cattle are raised as well. The region is known for rose culture, introduced about 1795 by the navigator Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, and for the soft white cheese called Brie.
