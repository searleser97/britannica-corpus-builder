Baluchistan, also spelled Balūchestān or Balochistan,  traditional region of southeastern Iran, the greater part of which is in Sīstān va Balūchestān ostān (province). With harsh physical and social conditions, the region is among the least developed in Iran. Precipitation, scarce and falling mostly in violent rainstorms, causes floods and heavy erosion, while heat is oppressive for eight months of the year. Its mountain chains, including the Bāmposht Mountains, run east-west, parallel to the Gulf of Oman, making access difficult. In the centre of the region there is abundant groundwater and streams, such as the Māshkīd and the Konārī rivers, that sometimes open out into valleys.
Baluchistan is inhabited by the Baloch, a group of tribes also found in the Balochistan province of Pakistan as well as in neighbouring areas of Afghanistan. The Baloch are Sunni Muslims and speak Balochi, one of the oldest living languages of the Indo-Iranian group of the Indo-European languages.
In ancient times Baluchistan provided a land route to the Indus Valley and the Babylonian civilizations. The armies of Alexander the Great marched through Baluchistan in 326 bce on their way to the Hindu Kush and on their return march in 325 experienced great hardships in the region’s barren wastes.
