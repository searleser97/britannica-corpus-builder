Holstein,  historic and cultural region occupying the southern part of the Jutland Peninsula between the Eider and Elbe rivers, now comprising the southern half of Schleswig-Holstein Land (state) in northern Germany.
Holstein was created as a county of the Holy Roman Empire in 1111. It came under a personal union with the Danish king in 1459, an arrangement which caused much unrest among the German majority. In 1474 Holstein was raised to the rank of a duchy in the Holy Roman Empire and after 1815 in the German Confederation. Attempts by Denmark to annex Holstein and Schleswig led to war with Austria and Prussia in 1864. Denmark was defeated, and the administration of Holstein was conferred to Austria by the Convention of Gastein (August 14, 1865). This arrangement proved to be untenable, however, and Prussia’s victory over Austria in the Seven Weeks’ War led to the annexation of Holstein by Prussia: after the Peace of Prague (1866), it was incorporated with Schleswig as a single Prussian province.
The people of Holstein are mostly descendants of the Saxons and speak a Low German dialect. More than 85 percent are Protestants. The predominant rural settlement pattern in the marshlands along the North Sea coast and Elbe River is one of linear villages (Marschhufendörfer) situated along interior dikes and canals, with their fields extending at right angles in long narrow strips. In the eastern farming zone along the Baltic coast, compact villages, small hamlets, and large estates dominate. Farms of the less fertile central Geest region are dispersed. The traditional single-story Saxon farmhouse is characteristic of Holstein. One vast, steeply sloping roof houses the Diele, a large threshing floor running through the building, and the living quarters and stables on either side. The Diele is entered through a large gateway at the gable end of the building.
