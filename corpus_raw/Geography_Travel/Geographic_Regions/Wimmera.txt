Wimmera,  region, west-central Victoria, Australia. Thomas Mitchell first surveyed the area in 1836 and named it for an Aboriginal term meaning boomerang, throwing stick, or spear thrower. The area was settled in the 1860s. Its generally level terrain, in the basin of the north-flowing, dissipative Wimmera River, is bounded by the Murray River on the north and the Eastern Highlands to the south and covers an area of about 9,200 square miles (23,800 square km). Receiving 15 to 25 inches (380 to 635 mm) of rainfall annually, it produces grains and supports livestock raising. Irrigated farming, largely developed since 1953 and centred on Horsham, yields fruits and vegetables.
