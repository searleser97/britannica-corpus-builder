Selangor,   region of western West Malaysia (Malaya), occupying part of a coastal alluvial plain on the Strait of Malacca. In 1974, a 94-square-mile (243-square-kilometre) portion of Selangor, centring on Kuala Lumpur, was designated a wilayapersekutuan (federal territory). Selangor’s history and economic development have been closely linked with two rivers, the Kelang and the Langat, which were the main settlement routes for Malays and immigrant Chinese.
One of the original Negeri Sembilan (“Nine States”) under the rule of old Malacca, Selangor became an independent state (18th century) ruled by Buginese from Makasar in the Celebes. In the late 19th century Chinese tin miners, mainly from Singapore, arrived, and an ensuing civil war in their jungle camps led to British intervention, culminating in protectorate status (1874) and membership in the Federated Malay States (1896) and the Federation of Malaya (1948). Although Chinese and Indians outnumber Malays, Selangor has been the focus of Malay nationalist politics and attendant communal rivalries.
A 20-mile (32-kilometre) railway built between Kuala Lumpur and Klang (the sultan’s residence) about 1890 was the beginning of an extensive series of rail and road links with Singapore and Pinang that were constructed to handle the increasing output of rubber and tin. Port Swettenham, now Port Kelang (q.v.), was developed beside a broad channel on the delta below Klang (now Kelang) to handle bulky commodities. Other important towns include Kuala Selangor, Kuala Kubu Baharu, and Kajang.
The region’s modern economy is broad-based, with tin, coconuts, and rubber as major products. Subsistence paddy (rice) is grown in the upland valleys and at Tanjung Karang, a swampy northern coastal strip. Pineapples, coffee, rice, tea, cocoa, and palm products are significant crops. Coal is mined at Batu Arang. Industrial and commercial development is concentrated in a sector between Kuala Lumpur-Petaling Jaya and Port Kelang.
