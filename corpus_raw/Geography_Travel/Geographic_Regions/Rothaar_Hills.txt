Rothaar Hills, German Rothaargebirge,  southernmost mountain region of the Sauerland in the Middle Rhine Highlands of southeastern North Rhineâ€“Westphalia Land (state), west-central Germany. The round-topped hills reach their highest point at the heath-covered Kahler Asten (2,759 feet [841 m]). Heavily forested slopes fall steeply to the Lenne and Sieg valleys in the north and west but drop gradually to the southeast, where they are drained by the Lahn and Eder rivers of Hesse Land. Heavy rainfall and long, cold winters hinder arable cultivation in the region. The local economy is dependent largely on forestry, stock raising, and tourism. A number of health spas and holiday resorts exist in the area, including those at Winterberg (the chief winter sports centre), Schmallenberg, and Willingen.
