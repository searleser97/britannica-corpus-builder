Sindh Sagar Doab,  one of the five major doabs of the Punjab province of Pakistan. Doab, a Persian term, signifies an area between two rivers. The Sindh Sagar Doab is the area between the Indus River and the Jhelum River. As such, it forms the northwestern portion of the Punjab plains. It is the largest of the Punjab doabs in land area but also the poorest, due to its limited agricultural land. Major areas in this doab include the Kāla Chitta Range, Margalla and Murree hills, Potwar Plateau, Salt Range, and Thal. Some of the major cities are Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Taxila, Attock, Chakwāl, Jhelum, Pind Dādan Khān, Talagang, Miānwāli, Bhakkar, Leiah (Layyah), Kot Addu, Muzaffargarh, Khushāb, and Quaidabad. Main eastern tributaries of the Indus are the Haro River, which joins the Indus below Attock, and the Soan River, which joins the Indus below Makhad.
