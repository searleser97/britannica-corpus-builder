Wheat Belt,   principal crop-growing region of Western Australia, occupying about 60,000 square miles (160,000 square km) in the southwestern section of the state. Served by the Perth-Albany Railway, the crescent-shaped belt is delineated on the west by a line drawn from Geraldton south through Moora, Northam, and Katanning to the western end of the Great Australian Bight. The eastern boundary of the belt bulges as far east as Southern Cross. The Wheat Belt receives as much as 20 inches (500 mm) of rainfall annually in the west, declining to 10 inches (250 mm) in the east. In addition to wheat, the area yields oats, barley, and wool. The Wheat Belt developed after the decline of gold mining in 1905 and was aided by the introduction of superphosphate fertilizers, new breeds of livestock, machinery, government loans, surveys, railway feeder-line construction, immigration, and “soldier settlement schemes” for military veterans after both World Wars.
