Heartland, also called Pivot Area,  landlocked region of central Eurasia whose control was posited by Sir Halford J. Mackinder in the early 20th century as the key to world domination in an era of declining importance for traditionally invincible sea power. Mackinder observed that the majority of the world’s population resided on the Eurasian and African landmass and that control of this “world island” would lead to eventual world domination. This world island could be best controlled from the pivot area, which would guarantee self-sufficiency in food for the country dominating the region, and the pivot area’s inaccessibility by sea would provide a formidable defensive barrier. The pivot area was vulnerable to land attack only by way of the plains of eastern Europe. Thus, control of eastern Europe would ensure domination of the pivot area and ultimately world domination. Mackinder’s landbased theory of world power contradicted the conventional maritime theory advocated by Alfred Thayer Mahan during the 19th century. In 1919 Mackinder renamed the concept the heartland.
Between the two World Wars, Mackinder’s ideas became important to German students of geopolitics. Following World War II, Mackinder became even more convinced of the validity of the heartland concept and warned of possible world domination by the Soviet Union if it were able to gain control of all of Germany and eastern Europe, much of which it did in fact gain.
Some critics believe that the advent of air power destroyed the validity of Mackinder’s landbased theory of world power. Mackinder, however, writing some decades before the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads, believed that air power did not diminish the significance of the heartland.
