Rhondda,  community and urban area (from 2011 built-up area), Rhondda Cynon Taff county borough, historic county of Glamorgan (Morgannwg), southern Wales. Rhondda comprises two almost continuous belts of settlement along the valleys of the Rivers Rhondda Fawr (“Great Rhondda”) and Rhondda Fach (“Small Rhondda”).
The whole area, isolated and thinly inhabited in the early 19th century (the population in 1801 was 542), was transformed when the quality of the bituminous (steam) coals beneath it became known, especially after the sinking of the Treherbert mines in 1855. Many collieries were established, railways were built to the docks at Cardiff, Barry, and Port Talbot, and the valleys quickly filled with mining settlements. By 1901 the population was more than 113,000. By 1924 it was almost 170,000, including nearly 40,000 miners. By then the Rhondda’s exclusive dependence on mining already threatened to bring economic disaster. After 1918 the market for steam coal slumped. At one time in the mid-1930s the local unemployment rate rose to 47 percent, and thousands of families moved from the area. Even though the government-aided opening of a wide range of light manufacturing and service industries provided some alternative employment, the population continued to decline. Coal mining has continued to decline dramatically. Extensive afforestation of abandoned land began in the 1960s. Pop. (2001) Rhondda urban area, 59,602; (2011) Rhondda built-up area subdivision, 13,333; Tonypandy built-up area (including Rhondda), 62,545.
