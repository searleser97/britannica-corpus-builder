Masurian Lakeland, Polish Pojezierze Mazurskie,  lake district, northeastern Poland. It is a 20,000-square-mile (52,000-square-km) area immediately to the south of the Baltic coastal plains and extends 180 miles (290 km) eastward from the lower Vistula River to the borders with Lithuania and Belarus. It lies within the provinces of Warmińsko-Mazurskie and Podlaskie. There are more than 2,000 lakes (with Śniardwy being the largest), originally formed by meltwaters from the Vistula ice sheet, in the district. Shallow proglacial stream valleys in the region contain marshes and sand dunes. The morainal Dylewska Hill, which rises to about 1,000 feet (300 metres), is southwest of the city of Olsztyn.
The Masurian Lakeland is thinly populated, with many forests, meadows, and pastures. Fertile black and brown soils are found in the western part of the district and produce wheat and sugar beets; sandy soils in the eastern part of the district produce potatoes and rye. The principal urban centres are Elbląg, Olsztyn, and Ełk. Resort towns include Giżycko and Mikołajki.
