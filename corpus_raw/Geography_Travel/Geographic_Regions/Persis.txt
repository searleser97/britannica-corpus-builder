Persis, Persian Parsa,  ancient country in the southwestern part of Iran, roughly coextensive with the modern region of Fārs. Its name was derived from the Iranian tribe of the Parsua (Parsuash; Parsumash; Persians), who settled there in the 7th century bc. Herodotus lists the leading Persian tribes as the Pasargadae, to which the Achaemenians, the royal family of Persia, belonged; the Maraphii; and the Maspii. It was these three that Cyrus II the Great assembled to approve his plans for his revolt against Astyages, his Median overlord, in 550 bc.
The inhabitants of Persis were considered to be the rulers of the Achaemenian Empire and were exempt from taxation. As the homeland of the Achaemenian dynasty, Persis was closely associated with the monarchy. Cyrus built his capital at Pasargadae, and about 30 miles (48 km) to the southwest Darius I founded his new capital of Parsa, known to the Greeks as Persepolis (“Persian City”).
The history of Persis after the fall of the Achaemenian Empire in 330 bc is obscure. Lying apart from the main strategic and economic highways of Iran, it preserved its ancient culture, language, and religion under the Seleucids and enjoyed considerable autonomy during the Parthian period. In the 3rd century ad its rulers, heirs of the Achaemenian tradition, founded the Sāsānian empire.
