Maremma,  geographic region, largely within Tuscany (Toscana) regione, central Italy, extending along the Tyrrhenian coast from south of Livorno to Rome and inland to the Apennine foothills.
In Etruscan and Roman times the Maremma was well settled and known for its farms, which were drained by subterranean canals. Among the Etruscan towns situated on hilltops, Populonia, Cosa, Tarquinii, and Caere were the largest, and several ports handled Etruriaâ€™s foreign trade. During the later years of the Roman Empire, the region declined rapidly. Drainage was neglected and malaria became endemic. The Maremma eventually was used only as a winter grazing ground for herds from the Apennines, in spite of reclamation efforts by the grand dukes of Tuscany in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Some reclamation and drainage of the swamps began in the 1930s, and, beginning in 1951, the Maremma Land Reform Agency spent considerable sums on the region. New farms, roads, and rural service centres were built, changing the face of the Maremma beyond recognition. Much of that reclamation work was thwarted in 1966, however, when torrential rainstorms and the flooding of the Ombrone River inundated the land, with disastrous loss of livestock and equipment.
