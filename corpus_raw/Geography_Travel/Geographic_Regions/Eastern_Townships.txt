Eastern Townships, French Les Cantons de L’est,  region in southeastern Quebec, Canada, between the St. Lawrence lowlands and the U.S.-Canadian border and centred on Sherbrooke. It extends from Granby in the southwest to Lac-Mégantic in the southeast and from Drummondville in the northwest to the Maine border in the northeast.
The region contains parallel ranges of hills (extensions of the Appalachians), the Sutton Mountains (extensions of the Green Mountains of Vermont), the Stoke Mountains, and the Megantic Range. A few lakes and various rivers empty into the St. Lawrence River.
Although a few loyalists from the United States had settled at Missisquoi Bay of Lake Champlain as early as 1784, after the American Revolution, it was not until 1791 that the region was surveyed and English land laws were imposed on Lower Canada, replacing the French system of seigneural tenure. Then, although the initial settlers were British (mostly loyalists), a large influx of French Canadians filled the area, so that today nine-tenths of the population is French-speaking. In July 2013 Lac-Mégantic was the site of a devastating rail disaster when a runaway train carrying crude oil derailed, exploded, and spread fire, destroying some 30 buildings and claiming many lives.
The diversified economy of Eastern Townships includes asbestos mining, traditionally supplying about 80 percent of the world total but declining because of the growing recognition of the health risks of asbestos. Agriculture includes dairy farming, sheep raising, and fruit growing. The region is also important for manufactures, especially in textiles, paper, furniture, microelectronics, and machinery.
