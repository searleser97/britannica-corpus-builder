Estremadura,  historical coastal province of central Portugal that contains Lisbon and the Tagus River estuary.
The landforms of Estremadura are geologically younger than other parts of the Iberian Peninsula, containing sandstone, limestone, and volcanic rock instead of granite and schist. The peninsulas of Lisbon and Setúbal are divided by the lower Tagus River valley. Land use north of the Tagus is diverse. Vineyards, olive groves, and cereal plots are found on the hilly slopes, and the Cartaxo and Torres areas are known for their wines. South of the Tagus the landscape is less tamed; much is still unproductive or in extensive estates of cork oak forest. Along the Tagus valley, corn (maize), grapes, rice, and wheat are cultivated, and some of Portugal’s finest horses and fighting bulls—both used in Portuguese bullfights—are raised there. A bullfighting museum is near Sintra.
Known as the Portuguese Riviera, the coastal region west of the city of Lisbon has important resort centres, including Estoril, Cascais, and Sintra. Apart from Lisbon, other chief towns include Setúbal, the main sardine port, with canneries; Barreiro and Almada, suburbs of Lisbon; and the fishing towns of Peniche and Nazaré.
