Kohistan, (Persian and Urdu: “Country of the Hills” or “Highlands”)  area of mountainous or hilly tracts in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Kohistan is that sparsely populated area of Pakistan which lies west of Chilas in Kashmir and the Kagan Valley. The eastern part is known as Indus Kohistan (for the Indus River), and the western part, divided between Swat Kohistan (also called Kalam) and Dir Kohistan, extends across the northern part of the state to the Afghanistan border. The area comprises mountain ranges in the outer reaches of the Himalayas that are snowbound above 12,000 feet (3,700 metres), forest- and grass-covered hills (5,000–6,000 feet [1,500–1,800 metres]), and the fertile Indus valley. The inhabitants of this region are peoples of Turco-Iranian origin, including Pashtun tribes. Livestock (mainly sheep and goats) are raised, and grains and vegetables are grown.
Sindh Kohistan, in the west of Sindh province, Pakistan, is a barren hilly tract consisting of outlying spurs of the Kirthar Range. Cultivation is possible only along the numerous hill streams (nalas) that carry water during the rains. Cattle grazing is the principal occupation.
Afghan Kohistan (Kuhestan), in part highly cultivated, lies north-northeast of Kabul and extends to the Hindu Kush (mountains).
