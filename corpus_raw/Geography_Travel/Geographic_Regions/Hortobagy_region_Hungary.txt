Hortobágy,  steppe region in east-central Hungary. It lies between the Tisza River and the city of Debrecen.
In the medieval period there were many flourishing villages in this formerly fertile region, but under Turkish rule the area became depopulated, agriculture declined, and the region became a grazing area known for its horses and horsemen. After the regulation of the Tisza’s flow in the 1840s, the Hortobágy became dry and barren, and betyár (“highwaymen”) roamed the mostly deserted area. In the 20th century irrigation canals made agriculture possible once again in a large part of the area. The raising of cattle and horses is important. The immense grassy plain is also home to many water birds, including various types of herons, black storks, white spoonbills, geese, and ducks, as well as buzzards and falcons.
Traditions and folk art still survive in the village of Hortobágy, which is the site of the Hortobágyi Nagycsárda (“Great Inn of the Hortobágy”), built in 1781. This village is the traditional centre of the region, where the road between Debrecen and Budapest crosses a stone bridge on the Hortobágy River. It has a folk art museum and an annual fair that includes horse shows. To preserve the disappearing steppe with its interesting flora and fauna, the Hortobágy National Park was created in 1973. The park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999.
