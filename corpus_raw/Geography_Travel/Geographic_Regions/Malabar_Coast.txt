Malabar Coast,  name long applied to the southern part of Indiaâ€™s western coast, approximately from the state of Goa southward, which is bordered on the east by the Western Ghats range. The name has sometimes encompassed the entire western coast of peninsular India. It now includes most of Kerala state and the coastal region of Karnataka state. The coast consists of a continuous belt of sand dunes. Behind this are many lagoons paralleling the coast and linked by canals to form inland waterways, much used by small boats. Inland is level alluvial land, well watered by streams flowing down from the Western Ghats. Rice and spices are the principal crops, with coconut palms on the coastal sand dunes. Fishing is also important. Kochi (Cochin) is the main port.
A large part of the Malabar Coast fell within the ancient kingdom of Keralaputra (Chera dynasty). The Portuguese established several trading posts there and were followed by the Dutch in the 17th century and the French in the 18th. The British gained control of the region in the late 18th century.
