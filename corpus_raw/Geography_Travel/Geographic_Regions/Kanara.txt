Kanara,  region along the Malabar Coast of the Arabian Sea, western Karnataka state, India. It is bounded to the east by the Western Ghats. Kanara was formerly divided between Mumbai (Bombay) to the north and Chennai (Madras) to the southeast, but the region became part of Mysore state in the linguistic reorganization of India in 1956. Mysore state was subsequently renamed Karnataka in 1973.
Kanara produces rice (the main food crop) and sugarcane (the main cash crop) as well as pepper, betel nuts, and coconuts. Teak and blackwood are obtained from local forests. The people of Kanara, called Kanarese, speak Kannada. The main population centre is Mangaluru (Mangalore).
