Mʾzab,  region containing five towns, one of the major groups of oases of the Sahara, central Algeria. It was founded in the early 11th century by Mʾzabite Berbers. The Mʾzab was annexed to France in 1882 and reverted to Algeria in 1962.
The oases stretch along the Wadi Mʾzab and are surrounded by chebka, arid country crossed by dry riverbeds. The region comprises the Pentapolis, five walled towns of varying size and importance; the houses in the towns rise in brightly coloured cubes along the banks of the wadi. An assembly of 12 scholars (ḥalqah) administers the five towns. 
Ghardaïa is the chief settlement, while el-Ateuf is the oldest. Beni Isguene is the sacred town of the Mʾzabite League, barring all nonmembers of the sect from some sections of the town and all strangers from spending the night within its walls. Melika, populated by black Africans, contains large cemeteries. Bou Nouara, built on a rock overhanging the river bed, is the poorest of the towns. The other towns, Guerrera and Berriane, were added to the Pentapolis in the 17th century.
Date-palm groves of legendary lushness extend 5 miles (8 km) upstream and are watered from six dams built across the river. The sound of the pulleys of more than 4,000 wells, called the “Song of Mʾzab,” is giving way to that of motor pumps. Fruit, cereals, and legumes are grown beneath the palms. A small industrial zone and natural gas piped from Hassi RʾMel are helping to modernize the area.
