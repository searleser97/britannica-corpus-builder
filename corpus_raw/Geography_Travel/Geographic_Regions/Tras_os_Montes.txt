Trás-os-Montes,  (Portuguese: “Beyond the Mountain”), historical province of northeastern Portugal, bounded north and east by Spain, south by the gorges of the Douro River, and west by the mountains of Gerês, Cabreira, and Marão. Geologically a part of the Meseta Central (q.v.), the terrain may be divided physically into two regions. Terra Fria in the north is a monotonous sequence of rolling hills and dry plateaus where grains (especially rye) are extensively cultivated and livestock are raised. Terra Quente, in the south, consists of the valleys of the upper Douro River and its tributaries. In this region, the traditional method of making port wine by treading the grapes has been almost entirely replaced by modern vinification techniques. The Alto Rabagão hydroelectric project on the Cávado River in Trás-os-Montes was opened in 1978, and other hydroelectric projects followed in the region in a steady sequence into the 1990s. Of archaeological interest are the Iron Age granite effigies of boars found in the province, most notably at Murça the 20,000-year-old open-air engravings in the Côa River valley. Bragança (capital of the historical province), Chaves, and Vila Real, home of the 15th-century explorer Diogo Cão, are the chief towns.
