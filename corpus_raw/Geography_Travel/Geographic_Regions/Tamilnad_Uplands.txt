Tamilnad Uplands,  hilly region in central Tamil Nadu state, southern India. The uplands extend over an area of about 15,200 square miles (39,000 square km) and are bounded by the Telangana plateau to the north, the Tamilnad Plains to the east, the Sahyadris (Western Ghats) to the south, and the Eastern Ghats to the west.
The Kaveri (Cauvery), Palar, Vaigai, Tambraparni, and Periyar rivers flow from west to east and drain into the Bay of Bengal. The Kaveri and its tributaries have diversified the terrain, by erosion, into the Tamil Nadu Hills, the Coimbatore-Madurai Uplands, and the middle Kaveri valley. The Tamilnad Uplands have an average elevation of 1,485 feet (450 metres) in the west, decreasing to about 500 feet (150 metres) in the east. (The Kaveri valley is about 1,000 feet [300 metres] above sea level.) The soils of the uplands are mostly loamy and clayey. Forests are almost nonexistent; scattered woodlands and scrub are found in the northern upland region.
Agriculture is the principal occupation of most of the population; crops include rice, millet, oilseeds, pulses (legumes), cotton, and sugarcane. The region is one of the better-developed industrial areas in India and produces textiles, machine tools, and chemicals. There are coffee, tea, cinchona, and cardamom plantations. Iron ore, magnesite, beryl, and zinc are mined. Roads and railways link the major towns and cities.
In the 4th century bce the region was known as Tamilagam and was ruled successively by the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kingdoms. A number of temples constructed during the Middle Hindu period (800â€“1300 ce) became the nuclei of Vellore, Krishnagiri, Dindigul, Coimbatore, and Erode. Muslim rule extended from about 1650 to 1800, when the region came under the domain of the British.
