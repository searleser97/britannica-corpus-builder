Lüneburg Heath, German Lüneburger Heide,  region, Lower Saxony Land (state), north-central Germany, between the Aller and Elbe rivers. Its main character is that of a broad saddleback running about 55 miles (90 km) in a southeast-northwest direction with a mean elevation of about 250 feet (75 metres) and a high point, Wilseder Hill, of 554 feet (169 metres). In the north and in the deep valleys are extensive forests of oak, birch, and beech; in the south, fir and larch forests have been planted. The soil is quartz sand, chiefly covered with heather and brushwood. The heather is mixed with broom, gorse, and juniper, the latter often forming small, pyramidal, cypresslike trees. Although the climate is raw and rich soil is rare, the heath is not infertile. The main products are potatoes, bilberries, cranberries, and honey. There is controlled grazing of sheep—the famous Heidschnucke breed. The district is also remarkable for numerous megaliths—huge undressed stones popularly called Hünengräber (“graves of giants”)—and a countryside with many picturesque farmhouses built in the typical old Lower Saxon style with red brickwork, oak beams, and thatched roofs. Large parts of the heath are under the protection of the federal German government as a preserve. Interlaced with footpaths, it is a popular destination for hikers. It is also crossed by important rail and road routes. Lüneburg Heath was the site of the German surrender in World War II (May 4, 1945) to Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, commander of the British-Canadian forces in northern Europe.
