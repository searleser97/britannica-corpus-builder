The term also designates a geographical area on the North American continent as apart from Latin, Spanish, or Ibero-America (comprising Middle and South America) with strong Hispanic traditions and heritage. The expression Anglo has come to signify a white, English-speaking North American as distinct from one of Latin-American descent.
