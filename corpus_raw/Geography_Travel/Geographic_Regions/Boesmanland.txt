Boesmanland, also called Bushmanland,  historic region in northeastern Namibia traditionally inhabited by the San (Bushmen). A part of the northwestern Kalahari (desert), Boesmanland is a semiarid region having deep, permeable sand beds with a vegetational cover consisting of perennial grasses, low-lying shrubs, and thorny woodlands. The San of Boesmanland (and of the Kalahari in general) were increasingly forced to congregate around boreholes and water storage basins at isolated settlements (such as Tsumkwe) as the water table of the Kalahari was lowered by the introduction of grazing cattle. The government has encouraged their instruction in rudimentary agricultural techniques and animal husbandry. By late 20th century, many San had become labourers and trackers in settled areas.
