Bresse,  natural region of eastern France, embracing parts of the Ain and Saône-et-Loire départements. It extends for 60 miles (100 km) from the Dombes region in the south to the Doubs River in the north, and for 20 miles (32 km) from the Jura in the east to the Saône River (west), toward which it gradually slopes. A moderately prosperous agricultural area, it is renowned for its poultry, especially its chicken.
The Antigny, Sainte-Croix, and Coligny families and the lords of Vienne were powerful landowners in the north until displaced by the dukes of Burgundy. Upon the death of Charles the Bold (1477), Bresse passed, with the rest of Burgundy, to the French crown. The southern part of the region, where after 1272 the house of Savoy superseded smaller nobles in power, became the province of Bresse, with Bourges as its capital in the 15th century; it was ceded to France under the Treaty of Lyons (1601). The whole of Bresse was later attached to the French military gouvernement of Burgundy and today is part of the Rhône-Alpes région.
