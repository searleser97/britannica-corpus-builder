Los Pijiguaos,   bauxite deposit and associated mining development, on the Pijiguaos Plateau, in western Bol√≠var state, Venezuela. Discovered in 1974, this large, high-quality, laterite-type deposit underlies some 2,000 square miles (5,000 square km) and is located approximately 25 miles (40 km) east of the Orinoco River, which is an economical source of transportation and hydroelectric power. Commercial production began in 1987 and reached nearly 3 million metric tons in 1993. Proven reserves amount to 500 million metric tons. The bauxite is transported down the Orinoco River to be processed at alumina plants in Puerto Ordaz, in greater Ciudad Guayana, some 300 miles (500 km) to the northeast.
