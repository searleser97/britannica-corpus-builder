Ennedi,   plateau region, northeastern Chad, central Africa, centred around the town of Fada. The terrain is primarily arid desert, with sandstone peaks rising to 4,756 ft (1,450 m). Wild game is abundant. The region has a sparse population of semi-nomads, chiefly Muslims who speak the Dazaga dialect. They live in permanent villages during the rainy months of July, August, and September but disperse for the dry season. Their herds include camels, horses, donkeys, sheep, and goats. Dates, wheat, millet, and barley grow in the oases. Because the area was considered ungovernable, following Chad’s independence in 1960 it remained under French military administration until 1965, when the French withdrew at Chad’s request.
