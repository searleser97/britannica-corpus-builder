Basque Country, French Pays Basque,  cultural region within the département of Pyrénées-Atlantiques, extreme southwestern France, bordering the western Pyrenees Mountains where they adjoin the Basque provincias of Spain, along the Bay of Biscay. The region extends from the Anie Peak of the Pyrenees to the magnificent rock-bound coast around Biarritz and Saint-Jean-de-Luz on the Bay of Biscay. The climate is very wet, rainfall exceeding 120 inches (3,000 mm) per year in the mountains, and numerous rivers divide the landscape into countless verdant valleys that support both agriculture and forestry. The Basque, who speak a language that is among the oldest in Europe, are ethnically distinct from the people who surround them in France and Spain, having preserved their identity among the waves of migrants who have passed through the region since prehistoric times. Along the coastal fringe, known for its pleasant climate, tourism is the economic mainstay with resorts such as Biarritz, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Ciboure, and Hendaye. There is also some fishing. Inland, on the foothills of the Pyrenees, sheep are extensively grazed for the production of cheese. The region has been largely spared from the problems associated with the Basque separatist movement in the Basque provincias of Spain and has provided a refuge for exiles of that and other conflicts in Spain.
