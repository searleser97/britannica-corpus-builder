The Trossachs,  tourist area in the Highlands of the Stirling council area, historic county of Perthshire, Scotland. In popular usage the name is applied to the rugged country extending west of Callander to Loch Katrine, but strictly it refers to that part of the glen between Loch Achray and the lower end of Loch Katrine. Much of its Victorian fame derived from the poet William Wordsworth’s tour in 1804 and the novelist Sir Walter Scott’s description in The Lady of the Lake and Rob Roy. Since 1919 the mountainsides have been extensively planted with conifers.
