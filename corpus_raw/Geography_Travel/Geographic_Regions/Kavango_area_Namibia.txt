Kavango, also spelled Okavango,  geographic region, northeastern Namibia. It is separated mostly by the Okavango River from Angola on the north, includes the western part of Namibia’s Caprivi Strip to the northeast, and is bounded by Botswana on the southeast and by the Owambo (Ovamboland) region on the west.
Kavango covers an area of 16,100 square miles (41,700 square km). A generally flat area, it lies at an elevation of about 3,600 feet (1,100 m) above sea level and usually receives about 20 to 24 inches (500 to 600 mm) of annual rainfall. Patches of tall grass interspersed with bush scrub and trees develop into forests of Rhodesian teak, mahogany, and mopane in the east. Big-game species are abundant and include elephant, buffalo, roan antelope, and impala, and there are crocodiles and tigerfish in the Okavango River. Nearly all of the region’s settlements are located along the Okavango, which is subject to frequent flooding.
The Bantu-speaking Kavango people, who are the main inhabitants of the area, comprise six different tribes. They practice dryland cultivation of cereals, as the irrigation potential of the river has not been utilized. Some cattle are also raised. The western part of the Caprivi Strip is inhabited by bands of San (Bushmen).
Lutheran (Finnish) and Roman Catholic (Dutch and German) missions maintain several educational, medical, and religious institutions within the Okavango River settlements. Wood carving has become an important local handicraft in the Okavango settlements. Rundu, the main settlement in the region, is located on the Okavango. A road connects Rundu with the town of Grootfontein, 150 miles (240 km) southwest.
