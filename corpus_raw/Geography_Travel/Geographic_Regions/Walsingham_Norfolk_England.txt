Walsingham,  area in North Norfolk district, Norfolk, England, that consists of the neighbouring villages of Little Walsingham and Great Walsingham. The area faces the North Sea slightly east of the mouth of The Wash, a shallow inlet of that sea. In medieval times Little Walsinghamâ€™s shrine to Our Lady of Walsingham attracted pilgrims from many parts of Europe, and the shrine is also a centre of contemporary pilgrimage. A special pilgrimage church was built in 1931 and enlarged in 1938. Little Walsingham has the ruins of the medieval Walsingham Abbey and a number of half-timbered houses. There are also the remains of a 14th-century Franciscan friary. The Perpendicular style parish church was reconstructed in 1964 following serious damage by fire. Agriculture and fishing are important in the area. Pop. (2011) 2,167.
