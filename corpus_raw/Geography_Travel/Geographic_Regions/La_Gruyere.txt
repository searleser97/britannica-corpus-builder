La Gruyère, German Greyerz,  region and southernmost district of Fribourg canton, western Switzerland. La Gruyère lies along the middle reach of La Sarine (Saane) River, on the edge of the Vaudois uplands and the Bernese Oberland (highland), south of Fribourg. The name is derived either from gruyer, a forestry officer, or from the crane (grue), the bird crest of the powerful counts of La Gruyère (923–1555). The principal towns of the district are Bulle, the capital, and Gruyères, the historic capital, site of the medieval castle of the counts. One of the richest dairying districts in Switzerland, La Gruyère is famous for its cattle and its cheese. Wood products and Gruyère cheese are produced at Bulle, and chocolate is made at Broc. The population of the district is French speaking and Roman Catholic.
