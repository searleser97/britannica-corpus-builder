Lower Egypt, Arabic Miṣr Baḥr,  geographic and cultural division of Egypt consisting primarily of the triangular Nile River delta region and bounded generally by the 30th parallel north in the south and by the Mediterranean Sea in the north. Characterized by broad expanses of fertile soil, Lower Egypt contrasts sharply with Upper Egypt, where the centres of habitation along the Nile valley are never far from the desert. Lower Egypt in late predynastic times constituted a political entity separate from Upper Egypt. But Menes (fl. 3100 bce) traditionally joined the two regions, that unification being recognized in the royal title, “King of Upper and Lower Egypt.”
