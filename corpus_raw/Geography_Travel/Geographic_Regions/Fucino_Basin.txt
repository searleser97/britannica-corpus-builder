Fucino Basin, Italian Conca Del Fucino, formerly Lago Fucino, or Lago Di Celano, Latin Lacus Fucinus,  former lake bed in L’Aquila province, Abruzzi region, central Italy, just east of Avezzano. The lake was once 37 mi (59 km) in circumference and about 100 ft (30 m) deep, although its level was subject to great variations because of the lack of an outlet. As early as ad 52 the emperor Claudius had a tunnel constructed, 3 1/2 mi (5 1/2 km) long, as an outlet to the Liri (Liris) River. The tunnel, still evident but no longer in use, fell into disrepair and various attempts to reopen it from 1240 onward were unsuccessful; by 1852 the lake had risen 30 ft above its former level. In 1854–75 Prince Alessandro Torlonia, a Roman banker, aided by French and Swiss engineers, drained the lake, becoming proprietor of the site in return, hence the name conca (“basin”). The reclaimed fertile land, belonging to the Torlonia family, was expropriated and divided into numerous small farms (each about 2 1/2 ac [1 ha]) by the Italian Land Reform Acts in 1952–53. Cereals, potatoes, sugar beets, grapes, and fruit are grown. Italy’s principal satellite tracking station is located in the Fucino Basin.
