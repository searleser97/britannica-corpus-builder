East End,  traditional area of London, lying east of Shoreditch High Street, Houndsditch, Aldgate High Street, and Tower Bridge Approach. It extends eastward to the River Lea and lies mainly in the Inner London borough of Tower Hamlets, part of the historic county of Middlesex. In the Middle Ages the East End was part of the great parish of Stepney. It began to take on an identity of its own in the 19th century. The East End has long been known for its immigrant populations and its poverty, and in 1888 it gained notoriety for the Whitechapel Murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Until the mid-20th century, workers in the area depended largely on employment at the London Docklands; major sources of income now include service industries and light manufacturing (notably clothing).The area underwent considerable reconstruction following the air raids of World War II, and overcrowding is no longer a widespread problem. Points of interest include historic Toynbee Hall, the Whitechapel Art Gallery, Spitalfields Market, and Petticoat Lane Market.
