Berar, also spelled Birar,  cotton-growing region, east-central Maharashtra state, western India. The region extends for approximately 200 miles (320 km) east-west along the Purna River basin and lies 700 to 1,600 feet (200 to 500 metres) above sea level. Berar is bounded on the north by the Gawilgarh Hills (Melghat) and on the south by the Ajanta Range. Historically, the name Berar was given to a province of varying extent, but it no longer has any administrative meaning, having been superseded by the term Vidarbha, though this name refers to a larger area including the Nagpur Plain and other territory in the easternmost part of Maharashtra.
Berar emerged as a distinct political entity after the incursions of Muslim armies in the 13th century. It formed part of several Muslim kingdoms until, on the breakup of the Mughal Empire, it fell to the nizam of Hyderabad. It came under British control in 1853 and was administratively abolished as a province in 1948.
The southernmost reaches of Berar on the Buldana-Yeotmal plateau are generally less developed than the rich cotton area of the Purna River basin. The region is predominantly agricultural, with half of the land under cash crops (cotton and oilseeds). Almost all industry is based on the processing of these crops. The principal cities are Amravati and Akola.
