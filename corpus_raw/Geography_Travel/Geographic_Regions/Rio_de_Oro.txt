Río de Oro, Arabic Wādī Al-Dhahab,  southern geographic region of  Western Sahara, northwest Africa. It has an area of 71,000 square miles (184,000 square km) and lies between Cape Blanco and latitude 26° N, near Cape Bojador. The climate is very arid, with virtually no precipitation, and there are extreme variations of temperature in the interior, ranging from nearly 32 °F (0 °C) at night to about 122 °F (50 °C) in the afternoon. Its principal town, Al-Dakhla (formerly Villa Cisneros), has a small port and must rely on imported drinking water. The Portuguese called the narrow inlet of the Atlantic Ocean at Al-Dakhla the Río de Oro (“River of Gold”), because the local inhabitants traded the gold dust of western Africa. In the 1880s the Spanish government claimed a protectorate over the adjoining coastal zone. After the Spanish withdrawal in 1976, the region was under de facto Mauritanian administration in the south and Moroccan occupation in the north. The presence of both countries was contested by guerrillas of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro (Polisario Front). In 1979 the Mauritanian government abandoned any claim to the area, and it was then occupied by Morocco. Polisario Front forces, however, actively campaigned against Moroccan occupation until a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire was declared in September 1991. The region’s indigenous population is made up of largely nomadic Muslim Imazighen (Berbers); many of the region’s inhabitants are believed to have fled to refugee camps established by the Polisario Front in western Algeria.
