Grain Coast,   section of the western coast of the Gulf of Guinea, in Africa, extending approximately from Cape Mesurado to Cape Palmas—in present-day Liberia—on either side of the Cestos (Cess) River. It was primarily a sphere of Afro-Portuguese trade. The name of the coast originates in the early trade in the spice known as grains of paradise (Aframomum melegueta).
