Wheat Belt,  the part of the North American Great Plains where wheat is the dominant crop. The belt extends along a north-south axis for more than 1,500 miles (2,400 km) from central Alberta, Can., to central Texas, U.S. It is subdivided into winter wheat and spring wheat areas. The southern area, where hard red winter wheat is grown, includes parts of the states of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska, and Colorado. This area is hot and dry in summer and is thus well suited to winter wheat, which is planted in fall, when it draws on moisture provided by autumn rains. Cattle often graze on the young wheat. As the summer heat hits, the wheat ripens and is harvested in July. Hard red spring wheat is grown in parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, where the climate is more severe and the winters are too cold for winter wheat. Thus, the wheat is planted in spring and takes advantage of the long summer days of this high-latitude area to mature by fall.
