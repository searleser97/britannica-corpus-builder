Emsland,   region along the lower Ems River, in Lower Saxony Land (state), northwestern Germany. It lies on both sides of the river, from the town of Lingen to the Ems estuary. Comprising a belt about 60 miles (100 km) long from south to north and 6–9 miles (10–15 km) wide, it includes three strips of land: the bog of the Bourtanger Moor, which stretches across the Dutch border; a narrow adjoining strip of better-drained, sandy soil containing the main villages; and the drained meadowland of the Ems River floodplain. Oil-bearing beds in the region lie at depths of 1,300–2,800 feet (400–850 m) and have yielded considerable quantities of petroleum; an oil-refining industry has consequently developed in Ems. Although peat bog still covers large areas, much of it has been reclaimed since 1928 by drainage, removal of peat, and fertilization of the subsoil. Small agricultural holdings support rye and potato crops, and milk production is important as well. Tourism is also increasing in importance.
