Uppland,  landskap (province), east-central Sweden. It is bounded by the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea on the east and by the traditional landskap (provinces) of Södermanland, Västmanland, and Gästrikland on the south, west, and north, respectively. It is composed of the administrative län (county) of Uppsala, the northern part of Stockholm län, and the eastern part of Västmanland län. The province’s terrain is generally flat, averaging less than 200 feet (60 metres) in elevation. The southern part of Uppland, which borders on Mälaren (lake), and the coastal region (known as Roslagen) have a more varied landscape, with deep bays, wooded heights, and numerous islands. Forests and bogs predominate in the north.
Uppland was the principal settlement in central Sweden during the Bronze Age. During the Iron Age it extended its hegemony over neighbouring kingdoms, becoming the heart of the Swedish empire. With the advent of Christianity it became the seat of an archbishopric as well.
Grain and potatoes are grown on the landskap’s fertile plains, and there is some livestock raising. Industry is diversified, ranging from ironworking and sawmilling in the north, with its forests and iron-ore deposits, to the manufacture of chocolate, machinery, and electrical equipment in the industrial towns of the south, such as Enköping, Sundbyberg, and Solna. Djursholm and Lidingö are basically residential towns, and Norrtälje, Östhammar, Öregrund, and Vaxholm are popular resorts. Uppland’s principal city, Uppsala, is the historic cultural and religious centre of Sweden.
