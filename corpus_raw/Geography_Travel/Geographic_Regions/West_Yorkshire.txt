West Yorkshire,  metropolitan county of northern England, comprising five metropolitan boroughs: Calderdale, Kirklees, and the city of Bradford in the west and the cities of Leeds and Wakefield in the east.
From 1974 to 1986 West Yorkshire was an administrative unit. In 1986 the metropolitan county lost its administrative powers, and its constituent boroughs became autonomous administrative units, or unitary authorities. West Yorkshire is now a geographic and ceremonial county without administrative authority. It encompasses the urban complex that has developed in the deeply etched valleys of the Rivers Aire and Calder as they descend from the Pennine uplands in the west to the Vale of York in the east. West Yorkshire extends north into the scenic valleys of Airedale and Wharfedale.
In the 18th and 19th centuries abundant waterpower and, later, steam power based on locally mined coal stimulated the growth of industry in the region. The traditional textile towns in the hilly western area, including Huddersfield, Halifax, and Bradford, are no longer major textile producers, and mining in that part of the county has ceased. Today in those areas, including the boroughs of Calderdale and Kirklees, engineering, paper and packing, and light manufacturing are among the most important activities. In the eastern part of the county, coal mining declined dramatically during the late 20th century; only a single mine remains, near the town of Pontefract. Wakefield is the only town that retains a large textile sector. In both Wakefield and Leeds, engineering and food processing are important. Leeds, the largest city in Yorkshire and a major commercial and cultural centre, also has substantial electronics, chemicals, furniture, and printing and publishing industries, an important financial services sector, and two universities. Area 783 square miles (2,029 square km). Pop. (2001) 2,079,211; (2011) 2,226,058.
