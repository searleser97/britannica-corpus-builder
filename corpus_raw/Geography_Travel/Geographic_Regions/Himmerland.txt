Himmerland,  region of Jutland between Hobro and Ålborg, forming the northernmost non-insular part of Denmark. It is nearly surrounded by water. At Års, the main town of the interior, the Vesthimmerlands Museum displays prehistoric and folk artifacts. Himmerland is a predominantly rural region of villages and farms. Although much of the former wetland has been drained, the leached soils are not highly fertile, and peat bogs still occur in the east. Himmerland’s wet, sandy environment supports unusual wildlife species. Eagles live in the 34-square-mile (88-square-km) Lille Vildmose (marsh). Rare clovers, orchids, and blue anemones grow in the Rold Forest, the remnant of a spruce forest that once covered most of the region. North of Rold Forest the heather-covered Rebild Hills, bought by Danish Americans in 1911 and donated to Denmark (1912) as a national park, are the site of annual Danish-American July 4th celebrations.
