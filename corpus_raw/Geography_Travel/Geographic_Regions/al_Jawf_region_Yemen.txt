Al-Jawf, also spelled Al-Jauf,  oasis region, western Yemen. It is bordered by the far-southwest extension of the Rubʿ al-Khali, the great sandy desert of the Arabian Peninsula. The Wadi Al-Jawf, an intermittent stream with headwaters in the mountains of the Yemen Highlands, crosses the area; its western and southern branches are small perennial streams.
Al-Jawf was the core area of one of the most ancient of the South Arabian kingdoms, the state of Maʿīn (c. 1000 bce–2nd century bce). From their capital, Qarnaw, the Minaeans of Maʿīn ruled over large sections of the southern Arabian Peninsula. The oases ofAl-Jawf were a fertile and densely populated area, with many towns. After the conquest of Yemen by the Abbasids in the 9th century ce, however, the power centres of Yemeni civilization moved to the west, and the region was neglected. In modern times Al-Jawf was one of the last areas to remain under royalist control in the Yemeni civil war of 1962–70; in 2020 it became a strategic focus of the Houthi insurgency against the internationally recognized government. The oases, now only sparsely settled, support nomadic tribes; camel raising and the pasturing of sheep and goats are the chief economic activities. Al-Jawf was once renowned for fine purebred Arabian horses.
