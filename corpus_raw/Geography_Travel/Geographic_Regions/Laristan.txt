Laristan, also spelled Lārestān,  extensive region in southeastern Fārs ostān (province), Iran. Situated between the Persian Gulf coast and the main water divide, it is characterized by ridges, dissected uplands, and depressions. The area, sparsely settled, contains nomadic Khamseh peoples of Turkish, Arab, and Iranian origin.
The first mention of the region is in a chronicle written by Mostowfi, a Persian traveler, in the 14th century ce, when it was ruled by the Muẓaffarid dynasty of Kermān. The Muẓaffarids were conquered by Timur (Tamerlane) in the late 1300s. After the death of Timur in 1405, Laristan was ruled by a series of local chiefs (khān) who continued to be quasi-independent under the Ṣafavid dynasty (1501–1736). The last khān was deposed and put to death by ʿAbbās I the Great (ruled 1587–1629).
The region is one of the more economically undeveloped areas of Iran; many of its inhabitants have migrated as far as Mashhad, Tehrān, and Khorramshahr in search of livelihood. The land reforms of the mid-20th century resettled the nomadic population and made agriculture more productive. Crops grown include cereals and fruits; industry includes brick and tile making and carpet weaving.
Lār, the chief town, lies at some 3,000 feet (900 metres) above sea level on a plain bordered by mountains separating the town from the Persian Gulf and on the road from Shīrāz to Bandar ʿAbbās. Lār contains the Qaisarieh, a travelers’ lodge, and the Masjid-e Jomeh (Friday Mosque), both built during the Ṣafavid period. Pop. (2006) Lār, 54,688.
