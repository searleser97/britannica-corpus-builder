Bergslagen,  major ore-producing region in central Sweden, lying northwest of Stockholm and extending from Lake Vänern (Sweden’s largest lake) to the Gulf of Bothnia. It falls predominantly within the län (counties) of Dalarna, Örebro, Värmland, and Västmanland.
In the Middle Ages iron was mined in Bergslagen on a large scale and was smelted with charcoal. Metal products were shipped to the south in exchange for cattle. New iron mines opened in the early 18th century. In 1877 an ore export port was constructed on the Baltic coast, at Oxelösund, and was connected by rail to the mines of Grängesberg and Stråssa. The development of Sweden’s world-famous steel industry was based on raw materials from Bergslagen.
While iron is the principal ore, Bergslagen has also served as a source of copper (especially at Falun), silver, lead, and zinc. Today the region has many factories producing heavy engineering and metal products. Avesta has important steel works, and Norberg is home to a reconstruction of one of the oldest blast furnaces in Europe. There are also a number of pulp and paper mills in the area.
