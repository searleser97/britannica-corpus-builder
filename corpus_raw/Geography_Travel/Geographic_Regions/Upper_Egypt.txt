Upper Egypt, Arabic Qiblī Miṣr, also called Al-Ṣaʿīd (“The Upland”),  geographic and cultural division of Egypt, generally consisting of the Nile River valley south of the delta and the 30th parallel N. It thus consists of the entire Nile River valley from Cairo south to Lake Nasser (formed by the Aswan High Dam). This division also includes what some scholars term Middle Egypt (from Lisht to Panopolis).
In late predynastic times, Upper Egypt constituted a political entity separate from Lower Egypt (the delta region). But Menes (fl. 2900 bce) joined Upper and Lower Egypt, and each Egyptian king thenceforth had as one of his royal titles “King of Upper and Lower Egypt” (or “He of the Sut-Plant and the Bee”), thus signifying that he was the deified representation of those divisions’ unification.
