Tōkai region, Japanese Tōkai-chihō,  industrial region, central Japan, extending along the Tōkaidō Line (railway) between Tokyo and Nagoya, and occupying areas of Shizuoka ken (prefecture). Tōkai is neither an administrative nor a political entity. It has close economic ties with the Chūkyō Industrial Zone. The region is characterized by both coastal lowlands and the inland peaks. Traditional manufactures included cotton textiles, wood products, and rice paper, which were supplemented during the Meiji period (1868–1912) by cotton spinning and Western-style paper-manufacturing techniques imported from Europe and the United States. Tōkai became Japan’s major paper producer during World War I. World War II increased the need for heavy industries. After the war, the region’s industries were converted to produce electrical appliances and transport equipment, and the Korean War (1950–53) revived the local textile, paper, and wood industries. Tagonoura port was built near Mount Fuji during the 1950s as the area’s industrial production increased. (Shizuoka had previously been the region’s only port.) Meanwhile, factories in Tōkai city, outside Nagoya, were built along the Tōkaidō Line to provide iron and steel for the motor-vehicle industry in Toyota city. Tōkai’s most extensive development occurred during the 1950s and ’60s. Major industrial subdivisions of Tōkai are the Eastern Suruga Bay district, the Shizuoka and Shimizu district, and the Hamamatsu district. Industries in the Eastern Suruga Bay district produce paper, textiles, and photographic film. Lumber products (resins, furniture, lacquer ware) are manufactured and tea is processed in Shizuoka. Aluminum, canning (oranges and tuna), and chemical factories operate in Shimizu. Hamamatsu is Japan’s leader in the production of pianos and motorcycles. Land subsidence and river-pollution problems have caused industries to create public industrial water supplies and drainage systems.
