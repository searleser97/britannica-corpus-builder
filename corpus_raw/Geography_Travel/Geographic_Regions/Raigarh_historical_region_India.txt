Raigarh,  historical region of western India. It is situated immediately south of Mumbai (Bombay). Though part of the Konkan coastal plain, its terrain undulates with rugged transverse hills reaching from the steep scarp slopes of the Sahyadri Hills of the Western Ghats in the east to bluffs on the Arabian Sea coast in the west. The coastal bluffs are separated by seasonal river valleys that support most of the area’s agriculture. Rice and coconuts are the major crops, and fishing and salt manufacture are important along the coast.
The Raigarh area of the Konkan coast had established trading with Greece as early as the 3rd century bce. It contains several ancient Buddhist cave temples at Pal, Kol, Kuda, Kondane, and Ambivli, as well as the Shiva caves on Elephanta Island. In the 17th century it became a Maratha stronghold. During the late 20th century there was considerable population migration to Mumbai, and the northern parts of the area were rapidly industrialized. Paper pulp, chemical, and engineering works are the predominant industries. Khopoli and Panvel are the main industrial centres, and Alibag is a major city. The noted resort of Matheran and the fort of Rayagad (King’s Fort) are located in the area.
