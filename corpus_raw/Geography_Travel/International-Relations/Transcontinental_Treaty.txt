Transcontinental Treaty, also called Adams-Onís Treaty or Purchase of Florida,  (1819) accord between the United States and Spain that divided their North American claims along a line from the southwestern corner of what is now Louisiana, north and west to what is now Wyoming, and thence west along the latitude 42° N to the Pacific. Thus, Spain ceded Florida and renounced the Oregon Country in exchange for recognition of Spanish sovereignty over Texas.
