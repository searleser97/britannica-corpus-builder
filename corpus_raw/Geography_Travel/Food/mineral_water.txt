Mineral water,  water that contains a large quantity of dissolved minerals or gases. Mineral water from natural springs commonly has a high content of calcium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, potassium, and sodium sulfate. It may also be impregnated with such gases as carbon dioxide or hydrogen sulfide. Mineral water is produced artificially by adding salts to distilled water or aerating it with carbon dioxide. The mineral content of both natural and artificial mineral water varies greatly, and in some cases it may be less than that of ordinary tap water.
Since ancient times people have bathed in water from mineral springs, especially hot springs, because of its supposed therapeutic value for rheumatism, arthritis, skin diseases, and various other ailments. Many such springs have become sites for health spas and resorts, some of the most famous of which are Bath, Somerset, England; Baden-Baden and Wiesbaden, Germany; and Saratoga Springs, New York. The use of mineral water as a beverage has increased greatly since the mid-1970s. Large quantities of bottled water from mineral springs in France, Italy, and other European countries are exported each year.
