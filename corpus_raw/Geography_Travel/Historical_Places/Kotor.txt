Kotor, Italian Cattaro,  walled town, seaport, and resort at the south end of Kotor Bay, one of four bays of the Gulf of Kotor (Boka Kotorska), on the Adriatic coastline of Montenegro. The town, situated about 30 miles (50 km) south of Nikšić, lies at the foot of the sheer Lovćen massif, which rises to 5,738 feet (1,749 metres). Kotor was founded by the ancient Romans as Acruvium. In the 10th century it was an autonomous city ruled from Byzantium, and from 1186 to 1371 it was a free city of medieval Serbia. It was Venetian and Hungarian for brief periods, an independent republic from 1395 to 1420, and Venetian again until 1797. The town suffered periodic damage from Turkish assaults and from earthquakes. Between 1807 and 1814 it was occupied by France. The French period was followed by Austrian domination until 1918, when Slav sailors in the Austro-Hungarian navy mutinied at Kotor and the town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (from 1929 to 2003 Yugoslavia).
Much of Kotor’s medieval fortifications remains. The town’s walls extend for about 3 miles (4.5 km), range in thickness from about 7 to 50 feet (2 to 15 metres), and reach a maximum height of about 65 feet (20 metres). Its main gate dates from the 16th century; the south gate, Kotor’s oldest, was partially built in the 9th century. Kotor has many historic buildings, the largest and most beautiful of which is St. Tryphon Cathedral, which was built in 1166 and contains many frescoes and a treasury of jewels. Also notable are the church of St. Luke (1195), which was originally Roman Catholic but has been an Orthodox church since the 17th century; the church of St. Mary (1221), which contains medieval frescoes and the remains of a basilica (c. 6th century); and several palaces of prominent families, including the 18th-century Grgurina Palace, which is now a maritime museum. The oldest town in Montenegro, Kotor is now a state-protected historical monument. In 1979 a major earthquake seriously damaged the town, but much of it has been restored. Also in 1979 Kotor was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Pop. (2003) 1,331; (2011) 961.
