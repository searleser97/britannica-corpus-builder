Maydūm, also spelled Medum,  ancient Egyptian site near Memphis on the west bank of the Nile River in Banī Suwayf muḥāfaẓah (governorate). It is the location of the earliest-known pyramid complex with all the parts of a normal Old Kingdom (c. 2575–c. 2130 bc) funerary monument. These parts included the pyramid itself, a mortuary temple, and a sloping causeway leading to a valley temple built near the Nile. The Maydūm pyramid was originally a seven-stepped pyramid to which another step was added. Finally, the steps were filled in, and the entire structure was overlaid with fine Tura limestone, giving it the appearance of a true pyramid. Most scholars agree that the pyramid was probably begun by Huni, the last king of the 3rd dynasty (c. 2650–c. 2575), but was apparently completed by his successor, Snefru, the first king of the 4th dynasty (c. 2575–c. 2465). Late in its reconstruction under Snefru, the outer casing and fill of the pyramid began to collapse. The work was abandoned, and the mortuary chapel remained uninscribed. The collapse produced the present appearance of the pyramid.
