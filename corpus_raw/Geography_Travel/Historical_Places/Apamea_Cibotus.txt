Apamea Cibotus, also called Apamea Ad Maeandrum, Apamea also spelled Apameia,  city in Hellenistic Phrygia, partly covered by the modern town of Dinar, Tur. Founded by Antiochus I Soter in the 3rd century bc, it superseded the ancient Celaenae and placed it in a commanding position on the great eastâ€“west trade route of the Seleucid Empire. In the 2nd century bc Apamea passed to Roman rule and became a great centre for Italian and Jewish traders. Disorganization in the 3rd century ad and the diversion of trade to Constantinople led to its decline. It was captured by the Turks in 1070 and finally destroyed by an earthquake.
