Empire of Nicaea,  independent principality of the fragmented Byzantine Empire, founded in 1204 by Theodore I Lascaris (1208–22); it served as a political and cultural centre from which a restored Byzantium arose in the mid-13th century under Michael VIII Palaeologus.
Theodore fled to Anatolia with other Byzantine leaders after the Latin crusaders’ conquest of Constantinople in 1204, establishing himself at Nicaea (now İznik, Tur.), 40 miles (64 km) to the southeast. Crowned emperor in 1208, Theodore gradually acquired control over much of western Anatolia. He and his successors sponsored a revival of Greek studies at their capital.
The next Nicaean emperor was John Vatatzes, who sought to retake Constantinople before his rivals Theodore Angelus, despot of Epirus, or John Asen II of Bulgaria (1218–41). He defeated Theodore at Klokotnitsa (in Bulgaria) in 1230. Between 1240 and 1250 he negotiated with the Western emperor Frederick II (1220–50) for help in reconquering Constantinople, but nothing came of the pact.
Theodore II Lascaris (1254–58) and John IV Lascaris (1258–61) maintained Nicaean strength against the invading Mongols during their brief reigns. In 1261 a Nicaean general, Michael Palaeologus, retook Constantinople and, as Michael VIII, founded the last dynasty of the Byzantine emperors.
