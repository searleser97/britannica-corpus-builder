Mungo,  paleoanthropological site in New South Wales, southeastern Australia, known for ancient human remains discovered there in 1968 and 1974. The Mungo remains consist of two relatively complete fossil skeletons of Homo sapiens; hearths and artifacts were also found at the site. At Mungo is the earliest evidence of human presence in Australia, a destination that could have been reached only by an oceanic journey lasting several days. One of the skeletons shows the earliest evidence of cremation yet discovered.
The geologic age of the specimens is both important and controversial. The importance lies in the fact that the Mungo remains may be from some of the earliest Asian representatives of H. sapiens. The controversy lies in the fact that geologic dating techniques and precise stratigraphy have been interpreted differently by people investigating the site. Using more recently developed techniques that rely on estimating background radiation, some investigators have proposed dates of 42,000â€“48,000 and even 62,000 years ago for the Mungo remains. Since there is a dearth of reliably dated evidence of modern humans in Asia much before 40,000 years ago, the earlier dates from these proposals have been criticized or treated with skepticism by other investigators.
