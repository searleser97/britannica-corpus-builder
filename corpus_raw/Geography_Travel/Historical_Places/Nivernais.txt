Nivernais,   in France, the area administered from Nevers during the ancien régime, and until the French Revolution the last great fief still not reunited to the French crown. Bounded southwest by Bourbonnais, west by Berry, north by Orléanais, and east by Burgundy, Nivernais in 1790 became the département of Nièvre.
Having formed part of the duchy of Burgundy, the county of Nevers (Nivernais) was given by Duke Henry I in 987 to his stepson, Otto William, who five years later handed it over to his son-in-law Landri. The first house of the hereditary counts of Nevers originated in this Landri and was brought to an end in 1192 by the death of Agnes, comtesse de Nevers. The county subsequently passed by successive marriages into the houses of Donzy, Châtillon, and Bourbon. Through marriages it passed to the duke of Burgundy and then the counts of Flanders and finally came to the house of Cleves (Kleve). The French king Francis I erected it into a duchy for Francis of Cleves in 1539. In 1565 Louis de Gonzaga (d. 1595), son of a duke of Mantua, married Henrietta of Cleves, duchesse de Nevers, and one of his descendants, Charles (d. 1665), sold the Nivernais to Cardinal Mazarin in 1659. The cardinal devised it to his nephew Philippe-Jules Mancini, whose descendants possessed it until the French Revolution. The last duc de Nivernais—Louis-Jules-Barbon Mancini-Mazarini—died in 1798.
