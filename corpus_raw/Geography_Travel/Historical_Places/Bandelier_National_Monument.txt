Bandelier National Monument,  archaeological area and scenic wilderness of the Pajarito Plateau in north-central New Mexico, U.S. It lies along the Rio Grande 20 miles (32 km) west-northwest of Santa Fe. Established in 1916, it occupies an area of 53 square miles (137 square km) and was named for Adolph Bandelier, the Swiss American archaeologist who, beginning in 1880, studied the region extensively.
The monument contains many ruins of cliff and open pueblos (villages) of pre-Columbian Indians, mostly from the 13th century. Of note are the large, circular pueblo of Tyuonyi, which lies in Frijoles Canyon, and Tsankawi, an unexcavated ruin located on a mesa about 11 miles (18 km) northeast of the main portion of the monument. Kivas (ceremonial chambers) and man-made caves also have been unearthed. Pi√±on pine, yucca, sagebrush, and juniper grow amid the rugged high cliffs and mesas in the monument.
