Cuthah, modern Tall Ibrāhīm,  ancient city of Mesopotamia located north of the site of Kish in what is now south-central Iraq. Cuthah was devoted to the cult of Nergal, the god of the lower world, and because of its sanctity it seems to have been kept in repair by all Sumerian and Semitic rulers down to a few centuries before the Christian era.
