Teishebaini,   ancient Urartian fortified town, located on the hill of Karmirblur, near the city of Yerevan in what is now Armenia. Russian excavations at Teishebaini concentrated on the citadel, which occupied the top of the hill and contained about 150 rooms. Among the most important objects uncovered were the remains of wooden stools with their bronze fittings; a statuette of the god Teisheba, after whom the town was named; numerous examples of gold and silver jewelry; and a particularly rich find of bronze armour and other war gear, including pointed helmets, shields, quivers, and belts. Also found in large quantity were stone seals and beads, carved ivory objects, and pottery bowls and vessels. The citadel was probably destroyed at the beginning of the 6th century bc.
