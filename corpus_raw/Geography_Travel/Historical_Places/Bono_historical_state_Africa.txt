Bono,  Akan state of western Africa from the 15th to the 18th century, located between the forests of Guinea and the savannas of the Sudan in what is now Brong-Ahafo region in the Republic of Ghana.
Bono was probably founded about 1450, and its rise was undoubtedly connected with the developing gold trade of Bighu, a Malian Muslim or Dyula commercial centre 40 miles (64 km) to the northwest. From there Muslim traders went to Bono soon after its foundation, and many members of the royal household were later converted to Islam.
The kings of Bono are said to have played a major role in the gold-mining industry; both Obunumankoma (flourished c. 1450–75) and ʿAlī Kwame (flourished c. 1550–60) are thought to have introduced new mining techniques from the western Sudan to the Akan fields, and Owusu Aduam (flourished c. 1650) is reported to have completely reorganized the industry. From the Akan fields the gold passed through the entrepôts of the western Sudan along the trade routes of the Sahara to the terminal ports of North Africa and from there to Europe and elsewhere.
Bono engaged in wars with Jakpa of Gonja and was finally subjugated in 1722–23 by Opoku Ware of the Asante empire.
