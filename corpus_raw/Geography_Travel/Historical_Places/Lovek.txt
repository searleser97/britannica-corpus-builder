Lovek,  the principal city of Cambodia after the sacking of Angkor by the Siamese king Boromoraja II in 1431. In the 14th and 15th centuries Cambodia was in a state of eclipse and became a minor state. After the virtual destruction of Angkor, Lovek was chosen as a new capital because of its more readily defensible terrain. It was located halfway between Phnom Penh and the lower end of the Tonle Sap (Great Lake). King Ang Chan (1516–66) chose Lovek as his official capital and erected his palace there in 1553.
In the 14th and 15th centuries Cambodia and the Tai state of Ayutthaya were often involved in warfare. In 1587 the Ayutthaya leader Naresuan (also called Phra Naret) attacked the Cambodians and reached the walls of Lovek before a lack of supplies forced an end to the campaign. In 1594 Naresuan succeeded in capturing Lovek, taking many Cambodian captives to repopulate areas of Siam ravaged in the wars with Myanmar (Burma). A usurper took control of the city until the Cambodian kings, with Portuguese and Spanish help, were returned to the city.
Lovek’s importance waned in the 17th century. A new capital was established south of Lovek at Oudong by King Chey Chetta II in 1618, after Cambodia won a degree of independence from Siam.
