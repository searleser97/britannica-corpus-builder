Montezuma Castle National Monument,  archaeological site in central Arizona, U.S. The monument lies in the Verde River valley just northeast of Camp Verde and about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Tuzigoot National Monument. Established in 1906, it has an area of 1.3 square miles (3.4 square km) and comprises one of the best-preserved pre-Columbian Pueblo Indian cliff dwellings in the United States.
The “castle” is a five-story, 20-room mud-and-stone structure, dating from about 1100 ce, built into a cavity in the limestone cliff face about 80 feet (24 metres) above the valley floor by the prehistoric Sinagua people. It is almost wholly intact. It has no connection with the Aztec emperor whose name it bears but was named by settlers who believed it had been built by Aztec refugees from Mexico. To the northeast is Montezuma Well, a large sinkhole rimmed with communal Sinagua dwellings dating from about 1125 to 1400.
