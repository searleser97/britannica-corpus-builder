Aram,  Ancient country, Middle East, southwestern Asia. It extended eastward from the Anti-Lebanon Mountains to beyond the Euphrates River. It was named for the Aramaeans, who emerged from the Syrian desert to invade Syria and Upper Mesopotamia (c. 11th century bc) and who built numerous city-kingdoms, including Damascus. It lends its name to the Aramaic language.
