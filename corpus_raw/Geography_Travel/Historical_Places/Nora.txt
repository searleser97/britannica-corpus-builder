Nora,   ancient site about 22 miles (35 km) southwest of Cagliari (Caralis) on the island of Sardinia. Although tradition ascribes its foundation to Iberians from Tartessus, the site, which lies on a triangular promontory ending in a steep cliff, is characteristically Phoenician. Apart from remains of a Sardinian nuraghe, or towerlike monument, the earliest antiquities discovered at Nora are Phoenician, dating from the 7th century bc. After the Roman annexation of Sardinia, Nora was its capital in the republican period and later became a municipium (Romanized community) under the empire (after 27 bc).
Excavations in 1952–54 revealed a wealthy imperial Roman city overlying a typical Phoenician port. The Phoenician town had narrow irregular streets and buildings of typical Carthaginian construction. The violence during the time of the First Punic War (264–241 bc) is evidenced by a tophet, where the ashes and burned bones of children were buried in great jars under stelae carved with a temple facade and an image of the goddess Tanit. The Roman city dates from the late 1st century ad; a fine theatre, an aqueduct, a temple of Juno, a nymphaeum, baths, and private villas have been uncovered.
