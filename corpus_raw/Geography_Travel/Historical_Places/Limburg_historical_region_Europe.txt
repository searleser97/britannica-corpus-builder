Limburg,  historic region of the Low Countries that was one of many small states resulting from the division of the duchy of Lower Lorraine in the second half of the 11th century.
The name Limburg was finally applied when the rival houses of Limburg (heirs of the first count, Walram of Arlon) and Leuven made peace in 1155. The territory along the Meuse River became known as Limburg, and the much larger territory to the west became known as Brabant.
The direct male line of the house of Arlon continued to rule Limburg until 1282. When war broke out between Count Reinald of Guelders (who had married into the rights of Limburg) and Adolph V of Berg (who had been granted those same rights by the Holy Roman emperor), Adolph was not strong enough to contest his rights militarily and sold them to John I of Brabant. After five years of war against Reinald and his ally, John was victorious. Limburg was united with Brabant under his rule but maintained its separate institutions and laws. In 1430 the duchy of Limburg was united with the rest of the Netherlands under Philip III, duke of Burgundy. As a part of the Burgundian inheritance, Limburg passed to the house of Habsburg in 1482.
With the Peace of Westphalia (1648), Limburg was divided in two—the northern part being ceded by Spain to the United Provinces of the Netherlands. In 1714, when the Peace of Rastatt was effected, the southern part of Limburg passed to the Austrian Habsburgs and formed part of the Austrian Netherlands until the French conquest in 1795. While under French rule, Limburg became a section of two départements, Ourthe and Meuse-Inferieure. Its name was restored in 1815 when it, with a few additions, formed a province of the new Kingdom of the Netherlands. The territory was traded off several times in the ensuing diplomatic discussions between the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. In 1866 Limburg was finally integrated into the Netherlands.
