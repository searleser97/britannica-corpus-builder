Hatley Park National Historic Site, in full Hatley Park/Former Royal Roads Military College National Historic Site of Canada,  an estate in Colwood, outside Victoria, British Columbia, near the southern end of Vancouver Island, consisting of Hatley Castle and 565 acres (229 hectares) of grounds. Originally developed as a residence, Hatley Park was converted to educational use, and it now houses Royal Roads University.
James Dunsmuir, a former premier of British Columbia, bought the property in 1907 with money made from coal mining. He hired architect Samuel Maclure to build Hatley Castle, a Tudor Revival mansion where the Dunsmuir family lived from 1908 to 1937. The castle, which was built with locally quarried stone, is 200 feet (60 metres) long and 86 feet (26 metres) wide, with a parapeted Norman-style tower 82 feet (25 metres) in height. The interior is lavishly decorated in the Scottish baronial style. Also on the property are three formal gardens originally planted by the Dunsmuir family: the Rose, Italian, and Japanese gardens. There are more than 9 miles (15 km) of trails.
The Canadian government purchased Hatley Park in 1940 and put it to use as a training school for naval officers. In 1942 it became the Royal Canadian Naval College at Royal Roads. By 1968, after several expansions and changes of name, it was known as Royal Roads Military College. The military school closed in 1995. In the same year, Hatley Park was declared a national historic site, and Royal Roads University was founded by the province of British Columbia. The university now occupies the site and uses the castle as an administration building, but a historical museum in the basement is open to the public.
