Washington Crossing State Park,   two parks on the Pennsylvania and New Jersey shores of the Delaware River 8 miles (13 km) northwest of Trenton. The parks mark the site where, in a blinding snowstorm on the night of Dec. 25, 1776, General George Washington crossed the river with 2,400 colonial troops and captured 1,000 Hessian mercenaries. The Pennsylvania park has an area of 478 acres (193 hectares); the New Jersey park, 369 acres (149 hectares). A memorial building at the site houses the David Library of the American Revolution. Other historic landmarks are Bowman’s Hill Observation Tower on the site of the Continental Army’s lookout station; the Memorial Flagstaff, marking the graves of Continental troops who died there; and the Point of Embarkation.
Across the bridge in the New Jersey park are the Old Barracks, built in 1758 and successively occupied by British, Hessian, and colonial troops. Other features are the Trenton Battle Monument, a 155-foot (47-metre) granite shaft marking the spot where the colonial artillery opened fire on Trenton, and McKonkey Ferry Museum, in a building that supposedly sheltered Washington and some of his men after the historic crossing.
