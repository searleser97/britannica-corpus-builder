Antioch,  a principality centred on the city of Antioch, founded by European Christians in territory taken from the Muslims in 1098, during the First Crusade. It survived as a European outpost in the East for nearly two centuries.
Antioch’s territory included the well-fortified, predominantly Christian city, the leading commercial centre of the Latin East, and an area that stretched north into Cilicia, east to the frontiers of Edessa and Aleppo, and south into central Syria. Its first prince, Bohemond I (reigned 1098–1111), and regents, Tancred (1104–12) and Roger, prince of Antioch (regent from 1112 to 1119), were successful in their attempts to expand the state, but the Muslims thwarted their campaigns to conquer Aleppo. Antioch’s princes often died in battle, leaving heirs too young to rule; succession disputes were frequent, and the king of Jerusalem often intervened to restore order.
The state prospered economically despite domestic unrest and Muslim onslaughts. Because trade was vital to Christians and Muslims alike, agreements were reached that enabled trade to continue despite religious differences. Spices, dyes, silk, and porcelain came on caravans from the East and were shipped to European markets. Nearby orchards and olive groves supplied sweet lemons and olive oil for export, and wood from the forests of Lebanon was traded to the Egyptians in return for fine cloth.
In 1187 Bohemond III (reigned 1163–1201) of Antioch obtained guarantees for the principality from the Muslim leader Saladin (reigned 1169–93), after Saladin had conquered a large part of the kingdom of Jerusalem. After Bohemond’s death, Antioch was torn by wars over the succession, and, though peace was restored, these disputes gave the Muslims time to gather their forces. By 1268 Antioch’s territory had been severely diminished, and the city itself surrendered to the attacking army of Baybars I (1260–77), Mamlūk sultan of Egypt and Syria.
