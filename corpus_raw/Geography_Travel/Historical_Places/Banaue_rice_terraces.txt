Banaue rice terraces,  system of irrigated rice terraces in the mountains of north-central Luzon, Philippines, that were created more than 2,000 years ago by the Ifugao people. Although located in several villages, they are collectively known as the Banaue rice terraces. In 1995 various sections of the terraces were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, described as “a living cultural landscape of unparalleled beauty.”
The rice terraces are situated in the Cordilleras of Luzon island. The remote area—some 220 miles (350 km) from Manila—has long been home to the Ifugao, wet-rice agriculturalists who began building the terraces about the 1st century ce. Despite possessing only basic tools, the Ifugao created an engineering marvel: a vast network of rice terraces sustained by an elaborate irrigation system. According to reports, the terraces—which resemble steps carved into the mountainside—cover some 4,000 square miles (10,360 square km), and their total length is estimated at approximately 12,500 miles (20,100 km), roughly half the Earth’s circumference. While the rice terraces were important to the Ifugao economy, they also served a cultural function, requiring intensive cooperation among the people.
By the early 21st century, however, the number of Ifugao in the area had greatly diminished as many migrated to more urban centres. As a result, a significant portion of the terraces began to deteriorate. Six years after sections were designated a World Heritage site in 1995, the terraces were added to UNESCO’s list of World Heritage in Danger. In addition to neglect, officials raised concerns about unregulated development in the area and the lack of strong management. Major restoration and conservation efforts were subsequently undertaken, and in 2012 the terraces were removed from the list. During this time officials also began promoting sustainable tourism, as the terraces became an increasingly popular attraction, especially those in the village of Batad.
