Swartkrans,  one of three neighbouring South African paleoanthropological sites, located just west of Johannesburg, where important fossil remains of hominins (members of the human lineage) have been found. The remains date to between 1.8 and 1 million years ago and include early Homo species as well as Paranthropus robustus. Fossils found there have established that more than one species of hominin lived in the region at the same time.
Swartkrans is a limestone cave that accumulated fossils via openings to the surface that occurred sporadically over the course of geologic time. Most of the early bone accumulations appear to be the result of carnivore kills. At its oldest levels are the remains of over 100 individuals of P. robustus and a few specimens of early Homo. The associated animal fossils imply the presence of dry grassy habitats at the time. Stone and bone tools occur throughout the sequence. Swartkrans, Sterkfontein, and Kromdraai are located within the Cradle of Humankind, a region designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999.
