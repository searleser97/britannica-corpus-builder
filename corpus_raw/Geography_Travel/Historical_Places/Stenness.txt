Stenness,  site of the Standing Stones of Stenness, a Neolithic stone circle on the island of Mainland (Pomona) in the Orkney Islands, Scotland. Only 4 of the probably 12 original stones remain; set in a rock foundation, some stand over 13 feet (4 metres) in height. The circle, about 200 feet (61 metres) across, is surrounded by a ditch cut through the rock. The larger Ring of Brodgar and the Maeshowe barrow are nearby.
