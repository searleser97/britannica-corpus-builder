Yoho National Park,  national park in southeastern British Columbia, Canada. The park occupies 507 square miles (1,313 square km) of the western and central slopes of the Rocky Mountains and is adjacent to two other national parks—Banff to the east and Kootenay to the south. Known for the Burgess Shale archaeological site, as well as for its geologic treasures, diverse wildlife, and scenic landscape, Yoho became part of a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984.
In 1886, the Canadian government reserved 10 square miles (26 square km) at the foot of Mount Stephen in Yoho as a dominion park. In 1930 a much larger area was declared a national park. Yoho contains one of the world’s most significant fossil sites, the Burgess Shale. Its fossil beds show active evolution of soft-bodied marine animals during the middle of the Cambrian Period (about 520 to 510 million years ago). The park’s physical features include glaciers, ice fields, steep mountains, and broad valleys. Notable sites are the Takakkaw Falls, Natural Bridge, Kicking Horse River, and Emerald Lake, where pockets of temperate rainforest can be found. This region’s species include western red cedar and western hemlock, both at the extreme eastern extent of their range. More typical trees include spruce, fir, and, to a lesser extent, aspen and cottonwood. Black and grizzly bears, moose, mule deer, wapiti (elk), mountain goats, and beavers inhabit the park, as do a wide range of bird species.
