Denkyera, also spelled Denkyira,  major 17th-century kingdom of the southern Akan peoples, situated in the forested hinterland of modern Ghana’s southwestern coast. According to tradition, its kings migrated from the area of the northern Akan or Brong. By the end of the 17th century they had subjugated the Twifo and the Akan subjects of Axim (to the south), had taken over the rich gold-bearing districts of Wassaw and Aowin (to the west), and had established their dominion over Elmina Castle—the wealthiest market on the Gold Coast.
The desire to control the major extractive areas of the gold-mining industry brought Denkyera into conflict with the Asante, against whom it waged a series of ultimately unsuccessful wars between 1699 and 1701. After Denkyera’s final defeat, many chiefs recognized the authority of the Asante king Osei Tutu—by whom they were incorporated into the Kumasi division of his kingdom—while others, moving south of Denkyera’s ancient capital Abankeseso, retained their national identity but acknowledged the Asante’s overlordship.
