Saint-Césaire,  paleoanthropological site in southwestern France where in 1979 the remains of a young adult male Neanderthal were found buried in a small pit. The skeleton was recovered during archaeological salvage excavations at the back of the Roche-à-Pierrot rock shelter, near the village of Saint-Césaire. It is significant because it was found in association with tools and other artifacts formerly associated only with early modern humans (Homo sapiens) and not Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis). Despite the inland location of the site, a marine shell was found buried with the individual.
The skeleton dates to about 36,000 years ago. Although it is badly crushed, most of the skeletal pieces have been accounted for. The individual exhibits the suite of characteristics typical of European Neanderthals. Its teeth, however, are modest in size for a Neanderthal, and its brow region and jaws are lightly built, all suggesting a reduction in the face from previous Neanderthals. Moreover, the limb bones resemble those of early modern humans, suggesting a change in the patterns of locomotion and arm use. These anatomical changes with respect to ancestral Neanderthals are consistent with a pattern also seen among central European late Neanderthals. The tools found at Saint-Césaire may corroborate certain behavioral changes suggested by the anatomical changes. The Saint-Césaire discovery has led some researchers to conclude that the Neanderthals were not only capable of but also responsible for some cultural developments normally associated with early modern humans. Subsequent discoveries at other sites such as the Grotte du Renne in Arcy-sur-Cure, France, support this assertion.
