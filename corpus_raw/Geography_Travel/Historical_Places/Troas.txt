Troas, also called Troad,  the land of Troy, ancient district formed mainly by the northwestern projection of Asia Minor (modern Turkey) into the Aegean Sea. It extended from the Gulf of Edremit (ancient Adramyttion) on the south to the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles on the north and from the Ida mountain range and its northerly foothills on the east to the Aegean on the west. In the southeast corner is Mount Ida (modern Kaz Mountain), which rises to a height of 5,820 feet (1,774 metres). The eastern and southern regions are rugged and partly wooded. The Scamander River (Küçükmenderes Çayı), fed from springs on the Ida mountains, has cut its way through the hills to the plain in the northwest and empties into the Hellespont just before the Hellespont flows into the Aegean.
In addition to Troy (later called Ilion), there were a number of smaller Greek cities in the Troas, including Sigeum and Alexandria Troas (whence St. Paul took ship for Macedonia) on the west coast; Assus on the south coast; and Neandria, Scepsis, Palaiscepsis, and Cebrene in the interior.
