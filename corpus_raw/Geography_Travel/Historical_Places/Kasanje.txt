Kasanje,  historical kingdom founded by the Imbangala about 1630 along the upper Cuango River (in present-day Angola). By the mid-17th century the kingdom of Kasanje had risen to become a dominant power along the Cuango, as it allied with the Portuguese in the area and often fought against the neighbouring kingdom of Matamba. By the end of the 17th century the kingdom had abandoned the commitment to rapine that was characteristic of Imbangala groups and had regularized marriage and child raising. The Portuguese established a controlled market, or feira, in Kasanje at this time, which served as a channel for the slave trade from states further in the interior, such as the Lunda empire. In the mid-19th century, Kasanje was able to repulse a Portuguese military expedition. However, this resolve was tested when commercially minded nobles, enriched by the commodity trade of the 19th century, subsequently challenged the power of the kings. The kingdom then had a number of civil wars, though it still managed to stave off Portuguese campaigns in the area in the 1890s. Kasanje was eventually conquered by Portugal and integrated into Angola about 1911.
