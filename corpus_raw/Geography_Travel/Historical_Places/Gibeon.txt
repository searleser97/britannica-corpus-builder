Gibeon, modern al-Jīb,  important town of ancient Palestine, located northwest of Jerusalem. Its inhabitants submitted voluntarily to Joshua at the time of the Israelite conquest of Canaan (Josh. 9). Excavations undertaken in 1956 by a U.S. expedition revealed that the site had been occupied during parts of the Early and most of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 3000–1550 bc) and in the latter part of the Late Bronze Age (c. 1550–1200 bc), just before Joshua’s conquest of Canaan—the town at that time being a dependency of the city-state of Jerusalem and probably not fortified.
It does not appear to have been destroyed by the Babylonians, who invaded the area in the early 6th century bc, and it continued to be occupied during the exile. Remains of this period included a large number of inscribed wine-jar handles, of which more than 30 contained the name Gibeon in Hebrew characters of that period.
