Akshak,   ancient city of Mesopotamia on the northern boundary of Akkad, identified by some authorities with the Babylonian city of Upi (Opis). About 2500 bc Akshak was conquered by Eannatum, king of Lagash. About a century later Akshak temporarily established its hegemony over Sumer and Akkad. The location of Akshak is uncertain, although the Mari letters (from the royal archives at Mari on the Euphrates River; c. 1770 bc) indicate that it lay near Eshnunna in the Diyālā River valley.
