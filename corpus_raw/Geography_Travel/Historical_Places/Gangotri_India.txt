Gangotri,  celebrated place of Hindu pilgrimage in Uttarakhand state in northern India. It is located near Shivaling Peak in the Himalayas, at the base of the Gangotri glacier and astride the Bhagirathi River, one of the two chief headstreams of the Ganges. Gangotri contains a small temple with images representing Ganga, Bhagirathi, and various other figures of mythology.
The bed of the river adjoining the temple is divided into three basins, where the pilgrims bathe. One of these basins is dedicated to Brahma, another to Vishnu, and the third to Shiva. The pilgrimage to Gangotri is considered efficacious in washing away sin and ensuring eternal happiness. The water taken from this sacred spot is exported by pilgrims to other parts of India. The temple is 10,319 feet (3,145 meters) above sea level.
