Mawangdui, Wade-Giles romanization Ma-wang-tui,  archaeological site uncovered in 1963 near Changsha, Hunan province, southeastern China. It is the burial place of a high-ranking official, the marquess of Dai, who lived in the 2nd century bc, and of his immediate family. He was one of many petty nobles who governed small semiautonomous domains under the Han dynasty. The tombs were discovered during the construction of a hospital.
The almost perfectly preserved body of the marquessâ€™s wife was found in tomb number one; it subsequently was placed on exhibit in a specially designed museum in Changsha. In the same tomb, an exquisite banner was discovered in 1972 that shows the noblewoman on her journey to heaven. This banner has become important for the information that it provides about ancient Chinese religious beliefs and practices. Also uncovered at Mawangdui were lacquers and silks that have shed light on artistic styles of the Han period.
