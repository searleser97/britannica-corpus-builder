Anurādhapura,   Sinhalese kingdom centred at Anurādhapura in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) from about the 3rd century bc to the early 10th century ad. Beginning in the 2nd century bc the kingdom of Anurādhapura was plagued by invasions from South India, which increased in later centuries. The South Indians gained actual control of the kingdom several times—in the 2nd century bc, in the 5th century ad, and most notably in the late 10th century, after which Anurādhapura was finally abandoned as the Sinhalese capital in favour of the city of Polonnaruva. In addition to the South Indian invasions, the kingdom was often beset with internal strife among warring Sinhalese clans, each wishing to establish its own dynastic line. In these struggles the insurgent clan frequently sought alliance with a South Indian kingdom or hired South Indian mercenaries. The most prominent Anurādhapuran dynasties were the Vijayan (3rd century bc–1st century ad) and the Lamakaṇṇa (1st–4th century ad and 7th–10th century).
During the more than 1,000 years of its existence, the kingdom of Anurādhapura developed a high degree of culture, especially manifest in its art and architecture. Because of its geographic situation in the northern dry zone of Ceylon, it developed a remarkably complex system of irrigation, considered by many scholars to be its major achievement.
