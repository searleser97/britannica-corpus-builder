Boina,   short-lived kingdom of the Sakalava people in western Madagascar. The Sakalava, who originated in southern Madagascar, migrated up the west coast in the mid-17th century under the leadership of Andriandahifotsy. When he died, one of his sons succeeded to the rule of southwestern Madagascar (the kingdom of Menabé).
The other son, Adriamandisoarivo, continued the migration northward and established his rule over a second Sakalava kingdom, Boina. At his death about 1710, Boina covered the broad coastal plain between the Manambalo and Mahajamba rivers and collected tribute from neighbouring states. Some disintegration followed his death, but Boina regained its cohesion under Queen Ravahiny (d. 1808). It allied with the French in opposition to the Sakalava’s traditional rival, the Merina of the central plateau. Competition among Ravahiny’s 12 sons divided the kingdom in the early 19th century and opened the path to conquest by the Merina before 1850.
