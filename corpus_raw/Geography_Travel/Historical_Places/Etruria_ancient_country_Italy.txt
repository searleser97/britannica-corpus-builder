Etruria,  Ancient country, central Italy. It covered the region that now comprises Tuscany and part of Umbria. Etruria was inhabited by the Etruscans, who established a civilization by the 7th century bc. Their chief confederation, traditionally including 12 cities, developed a culture that reached its height in the 6th century bc. Etruscan power extended into northern and southern Italy at its peak, but the cities of Etruria were gradually absorbed by Rome during the 3rd century bc.
