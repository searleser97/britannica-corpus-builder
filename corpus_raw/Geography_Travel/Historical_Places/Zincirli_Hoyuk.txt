Zincirli Höyük, Zincirli also spelled Zenjirli, Senjirli, or Zinjerli, ancient Samal,  archaeological site in the foothills of the Anti-Taurus Mountains, south-central Turkey. Samal was one of the Late Hittite city-states that perpetuated the more or less Semitized southern Anatolian culture for centuries after the downfall of the Hittite empire (c. 1190 bc).
The oval-shaped mound, excavated (1888–1902) by the German Oriental Society, was found to be occupied by a walled citadel, divided into different sections and containing several important buildings, including the upper and lower palaces, showing the characteristic bit hilani (or “pillared porch”) architectural type. Immediately surrounding the citadel was the city itself, enclosed by a circular fortification wall topped by 100 towers. The identity with ancient Samal was confirmed by the discovery of a victory inscription of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon from 670 bc. The importance of Zincirli as a settled community came to an end with the downfall of Assyria in the late 7th century bc.
