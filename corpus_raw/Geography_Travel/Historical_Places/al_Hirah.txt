Al-Ḥīrah,  (from Syriac ḥirtā, “camp”), English Hira, ancient city located south of al-Kūfah in south-central Iraq; it was prominent in pre-Islāmic Arab history. The town was originally a military encampment, but in the 5th and 6th centuries ad it was the capital of the Lakhmids, who were Arab vassals of Sāsānian Persia (Iran). As such it was a centre of diplomatic, political, and military activities involving Persia, the Byzantine Empire, and the Arabian Peninsula. It protected the Sāsānians from the attacks of Arabian nomads and served as an important station on the caravan route between Persia and the Arabian Peninsula.
Al-Ḥīrah is most important, however, in the cultural history of the Arabs before the advent of Islām. The Lakhmids adorned the town with palaces and castles in its heyday during the 6th century. Tradition holds that the Arabic script was developed there, and al-Ḥīrah’s role in the development of Arabic poetry and Arab Christianity was especially significant. Some of the best-known poets in pre-Islāmic Arabia (e.g., Ṭarafah and an-Nābighah adh-Dhubyānī) gravitated toward the Lakhmid court. As the seat of a bishopric for Nestorian Christians, al-Ḥīrah exercised a strong influence over the religious life of the East, helping Christian monotheism to penetrate the Arabian Peninsula.
Al-Ḥīrah began to decline early in the 7th century, after the Persians brought about the collapse of the Lakhmid dynasty, and in 633 the town capitulated to the Muslims.
