Western Reserve,   in American history, territory of some 6,000 square miles (15,500 square km) along the southern shore of Lake Erie in what is now northeastern Ohio. After the Revolutionary War, when the United States was formed, most of the former colonies had claims to unsettled lands in the West based on royal charters and grants. All the states eventually ceded these to the federal government, but Connecticut, which by a charter of 1662 had claim to a huge area reaching to the “South Sea,” reserved this part of its claim, intending to use it to compensate Connecticut citizens who had incurred serious losses during the war. A stream of Connecticut immigrants thus entered the territory. In 1800, however, Connecticut and the United States agreed to attach the Western Reserve to the Ohio Territory. The significance of the Western Reserve was its function as an extension of New England into the West.
