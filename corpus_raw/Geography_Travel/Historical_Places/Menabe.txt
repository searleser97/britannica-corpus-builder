Menabé,   historic kingdom of the Sakalava people in southwestern Madagascar, situated roughly between the Mangoky and Manambalo rivers. It was founded in the 17th century by King Andriandahifotsy (d. 1685), who led a great Sakalava migration into the area from the southern tip of Madagascar. Under his son Andramananety, the kingdom became known as Menabé, to distinguish it from a second Sakalava kingdom—Boina—founded by Adramananety’s brother farther north. 
At the height of their power, in the 18th century, Menabé and Boina together controlled nearly all of western Madagascar and were recognized as overlords by other kingdoms on the island, including Merina, their principal rival. Menabé’s eminence was short-lived, however. By the middle of the 19th century, it had been absorbed into the expanding Merina empire.
