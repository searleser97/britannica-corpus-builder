Heuneburg,   Celtic fortified site overlooking the Danube River in Baden-Württemberg Land (state), Germany. Recent excavations have shown that the Heuneburg fort community carried on a prosperous trade with the Greeks at Massilia (Marseille) during the 6th century bc. Imported Greek black-figure pottery and Massiliote wine amphorae have been uncovered. Mediterranean influence has also been detected in the stronghold’s fortification system.
Outside the hill-fort were a number of princely graves, including the Hochmichele barrow, which dates from the 6th century bc and is noted for its wagon grave, located in a great central burial chamber formed of sawed wooden planks nearly 20 feet (6 m) long.
