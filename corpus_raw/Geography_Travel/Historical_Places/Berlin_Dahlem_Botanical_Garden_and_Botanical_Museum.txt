Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Garden and Botanical Museum, German in full Botanischer Garten Und Botanisches Museum Berlin-dahlem,  oldest botanical garden in Germany. Founded in the 17th century as a royal garden for flowers, medicinal plants, vegetables, and hops (for the royal brewery), it eventually became badly neglected. In 1801 the botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow became director and began to rehabilitate the garden; a decade later he had created what was to become one of the outstanding botanical research centres and public displays of Europe. The botanical garden and museum were nearly destroyed in World War II and had to be rebuilt.
The Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Garden has special displays, service greenhouses, and acres of outdoor gardens, with about 18,000 kinds of plants. There is also a botanical museum that has a large herbarium of about 1,850,000 reference specimens, and there is a museum library. The centre publishes two periodicals, Willdenowia and Englera.
