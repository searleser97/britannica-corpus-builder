Kanapoi,  site of paleoanthropological excavations in northern Kenya southwest of Lake Turkana (Lake Rudolf), best known for its fossils of Australopithecus anamensis, an early hominin (member of the human lineage) dating to between 3.9 and 4.2 million years ago. Among these fossils is a relatively complete shinbone with features indicating that A. anamensis walked on two legs. Skulls and teeth of this species have also been found. The remains show A. anamensis to be very primitive but with small canine teeth like those of later hominins.
