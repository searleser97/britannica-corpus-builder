Open Range,   in U.S. history, the areas of public domain north of Texas where from about 1866 to 1890 more than 5,000,000 cattle were driven to fatten and be shipped off to slaughter. The open ranges of western Kansas, Nebraska, the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, and other western states and territories served as huge pasturelands for the herds of the Texas ranchmen.
The cattle trails went from western Texas northward, through Indian territory, and into the vast stretches of public-domain lands in the central and northern Great Plains. During the relatively brief period of open-range cattle grazing, these areas—“cow country”—were largely free of farmers with their barbed-wire fences and grass-eating sheep. Where water was scarce, wells were drilled and dams constructed.
In the mid-1880s, enormous amounts of British capital went to the United States for investment in open-range ranching. Foreign enthusiasm infected American financiers and businessmen, who formed cattle companies to reap the big profits of raising beef for domestic consumption or overseas shipment. The government cooperated by banning the fencing of lands on either the public domain or Indian reservations and by awarding beef contracts to the cattle companies. Beef purchased by the government was distributed among the western Indians, who were left without a food supply when the buffalo herds were destroyed.
The disastrously cold winter of 1886–87 sent the open-range cattle industry into a tailspin from which it never recovered. Investors were ruined as hundreds of thousands of cattle perished in the thick snow and ice. As cattle raising dwindled, homesteaders took over and fenced the lands. By 1890 there was little remaining to indicate what had once been a booming business on the open range.
