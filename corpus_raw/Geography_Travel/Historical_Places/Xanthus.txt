Xanthus, also spelled Xanthos, modern Kınıklı or Kınık,  principal city of ancient Lycia. The ruined city, situated on a cliff above the mouth of the Koca (Xanthus) River in what is now southwestern Turkey, was designated (along with the nearby Letoon religious centre) a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988.
The early history of Xanthus is unclear: although it is mentioned in early Lycian inscriptions, no Bronze Age remains have been found within the city. According to the Iliad, the Lycians, led by the hero Sarpedon, were the most prominent allies of Troy in the Trojan War. Xanthus reappears in the historical records of the 6th century bce as the principal city of Lycia. About 540 bce it was besieged by Harpagus, general of the Persian king Cyrus II. The Lycians, forced within their walls, collected their wives and children and burned them, together with their slaves and treasure, under their acropolis. Then, attacking the Persians, they died fighting to the last man.
The city was soon rebuilt and repopulated, and it flourished from the 5th century to 42 bce, when, besieged by the Romans under the command of Marcus Junius Brutus, it repeated its heroic defense. The site has well-preserved ruins of a theatre, temples, and other structures. The most remarkable ruins of the city are huge rock-cut pillar tombs; in the 19th century the British archaeologist Sir Charles Fellows sent reliefs and sections of the tombs to the British Museum, where they are exhibited today. Upon one of the remaining pillar tombs is the longest and most important of inscriptions in the Lycian language. Pop. (2000) 13,136; (2013 est.) 11,789.
