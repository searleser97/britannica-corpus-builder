Belize Barrier Reef,  coral reef that is second in size after the Great Barrier Reef of Australia and is the largest of its kind in the Northern and Western hemispheres. Extending for more than 180 miles (290 km) along the Caribbean coast of Belize, it maintains an offshore distance ranging from about 1,000 feet (300 metres) in the north to 25 miles (40 km) in the south, except at Rocky Point, where it meets the shoreline. The 370-square-mile (960-square-km) area is protected by the contiguous Bacalar Chico National Park and Marine Reserve (established 1996), Blue Hole Natural Monument (1996), Half Moon Caye Natural Monument (1982), Glover’s Reef Marine Reserve (1993), South Water Caye Marine Reserve (1977), Laughing Bird Caye National Park (1991), and Sapodilla Marine Reserve (1996).
Nearly 450 mangrove cays and sandy islands of varying sizes are contained within the reef and its atolls, which include the Western Hemisphere’s only coral atolls. Several rare and endangered animal species, such as the American crocodile, are found in the area, as is the world’s largest population of West Indian manatees. Other animals common to the region are sea turtles, red-footed boobies and other seabirds, and more than 500 species of fish, 65 species of stony corals (Scleractinia), and 350 varieties of mollusks. Above water there are some 178 plant species, and below are 247 types of marine flora; algal varieties and turtle and manatee sea-grass beds are plentiful.
The tropical climate of the reef—with average temperatures ranging from 61 °F (16 °C) in the winter to 88 °F (31 °C) in the summer—and its extraordinary fauna have made it a popular site for tourists. Historically, its primary attraction was as a fishing and trading centre; from about 300 bce to 900 ce the Maya used it for this purpose, and in the 17th century pirates of Scottish and English descent, having first sought safety at the reef, exploited its resources as well. Although it is threatened by the effects of water sports, sightseeing boats (whose anchors tear apart sections of reef), and fishing, the reef has been kept largely accessible to watercraft because of its importance to the tourist and fishing industries. The reef is a major source of seafood, especially lobster and conch, much of which is exported. Between 100,000 and 150,000 tourists visit the area annually, congregating around such snorkeling and diving centres as San Pedro, Caye Caulker, and Placencia. The Belize Barrier Reef was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996.
