Sŏkkuram,  Buddhist artificial-cave temple on the crest of Mount T’oham, near the Pulguk Temple, Kyŏngju, South Korea. Built in the 8th century, Sŏkkuram is a domed circular structure of granite blocks. A square anteroom houses eight guardian figures in relief. On an elevated lotus pedestal a large statue of the Buddha Gotama (or Amitābha, according to some) seated, about 11.5 feet high, carved out of a single block of granite, occupies the center of the main chamber. On the surrounding walls are 15 slabs in relief depicting bodhisattvas and 10 disciples in attendance. The sculpture of this cave temple is one of the finest achievements of Buddhist art in the East.
