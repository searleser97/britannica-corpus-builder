Sukhothai kingdom,  former kingdom, north-central Thailand. It was founded in the mid-13th century when a local Tai ruler led a revolt against Khmer rule. It remained only a small local power until its third ruler, Ramkhamhaeng, inherited the kingdom c. 1279. He extended its power to the south onto the Malay Peninsula, to the west into what is now Myanmar (Burma), and to the northeast into present-day Laos. On his death in 1298 the kingdom began to lose its power, and in 1438 it was absorbed into the kingdom of Ayutthaya.
