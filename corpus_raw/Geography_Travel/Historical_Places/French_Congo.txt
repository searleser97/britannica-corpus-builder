French Congo, French Congo Français,  French possessions in Equatorial Africa from 1897 until 1910, when the colonies of Gabon, Middle Congo (Moyen-Congo), and Ubangi-Shari-Chad were federated under the name Afrique Équatoriale Française (AEF). Thereafter, the term French Congo was used to designate the Middle Congo, until it became the Congo Republic (1959; now the Republic of the Congo).
