Republic of Cracow, also called Free City of Cracow, Cracow also spelled Kraków, Polish Rzeczpospolita Krakowska or Wolne Miasto Kraków,  tiny state that for the 31 years of its existence (1815–46) was the only remaining independent portion of Poland. Established by the Congress of Vienna at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars (1815), the free Republic of Cracow consisted of the ancient city of Cracow (Kraków) and the territory surrounding it, including two other cities and over 200 villages, altogether covering over 450 square miles (1,165 square km). With its population of only about 140,000, the republic was placed under the joint protection of Austria, Prussia, and Russia, which had divided the rest of Poland among themselves.
Despite the economic and political limitations imposed on the republic by its size and location, Cracow flourished. Particularly after the Congress Kingdom of Poland was strictly subordinated to the Russian Empire (1830), Cracow became the major symbol of Poland’s independent political existence and a lively intellectual and political centre for Polish patriots.
When a Polish insurrection broke out in Galicia (Austrian Poland) early in 1846, Austria held that Cracow’s independent status provided the stimulus as well as a forum for the planning of Polish revolts and obtained the consent of Russia and Prussia to suppress the Republic of Cracow. After a brief resistance, Cracow was occupied by Austrian troops (March 1846) and attached to Galicia.
