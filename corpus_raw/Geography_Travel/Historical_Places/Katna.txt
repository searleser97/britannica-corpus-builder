Katna, also spelled Qatna, modern Al-Mashrafah,  ancient Syrian city, Syria. It prospered especially during the 2nd millennium bc and was frequently named as Qatanum in the royal archives of Mari on the Euphrates. Excavations there in 1924–29 revealed a temple dedicated to the Sumerian goddess Nin-E-Gal. Foreign trade and influence were illustrated by the presence of a stone sphinx dedicated by Ita, daughter of Amenemhet II (1929–1895 bc) of Egypt, as well as several Mycenaean vases manufactured prior to 1375 bc, when the city was destroyed by the Hittite king Suppiluliumas.
