Kadesh, modern Tall an-Nabī Mind,  ancient city on the Orontes (Al-ʿĀṣī) River in western Syria. The site is located about 15 miles (24 km) southwest of Homs. It was the site of two battles in ancient times.
Kadesh is mentioned for the first time in Egyptian sources when Thutmose III (1479–1426 bce) defeated a Syrian insurrection under the leadership of the prince of Kadesh at Megiddo in Palestine. Kadesh remained an outpost of Egyptian influence until it came under Hittite rule (c. 1340).
During the 13th century bce, Kadesh occupied a strategic position in the path of Egyptian expansion in Syria. The Egyptian king Seti I captured Kadesh, and it was later the scene of a famous battle (1275 bce) between Ramses II and the Hittite Muwatallis. Although Ramses claimed victory, the actual result was a truce between the two nations. Upon the invasion of the Sea Peoples (c. 1185 bce), Kadesh disappeared from history.
