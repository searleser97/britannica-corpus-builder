Carnuntum,  the most important ancient Roman legionary camp of the upper Danube frontier, situated at Petronell, 20 miles (32 km) east of Vienna. It was the emperor Tiberius’s base in his attacks on the Marcomanni (ad 6), although a fort for one legion was first erected under the emperor Claudius. Stone structures built then were repaired ad 73–76.
In ad 106 it became the capital of the province of Upper Pannonia. Here the emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote the second book of his Meditations during his campaign against the Marcomanni (172–174). The flourishing town was destroyed by the Marcomanni, but was soon rebuilt and had regained its prosperity by the early 3rd century under Septimius Severus. The Conference of the Emperors Diocletian, Galerius, and Maximian was held here in 308. The altar to Mithra set up by them is an important historical source. Valentinian I stayed at Carnuntum in 375 during his campaign against the Germans. The German invasion of 395 signaled the end of Carnuntum and Pannonia was surrendered to the Huns in 433. After that, the historical record is silent on Carnuntum.
