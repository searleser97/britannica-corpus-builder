Rumelia, Turkish Rumeli,  the former Ottoman possessions in the Balkans. The name means “land of the Romans”—i.e., Byzantines. The Turks first began to make conquests in the Balkans in the mid-14th century. The land was divided into fiefs of various size that were administered by cavalry officers; local notables who converted to Islām also shared in the administration. The administrative configuration of Rumelia changed frequently until 1864, when the unit of administrative division became defined as the province, or vilayet, which was in turn divided into sancak (subprovinces). The Danube vilayet was formed first, in 1864, followed by those of Janina (Ioannina) and Salonika (Thessaloníki, in Greece) in 1867. Under the Treaty of Berlin (1878), the Danube vilayet formed the independent state of Bulgaria under Ottoman suzerainty; southern Bulgaria formed the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia with its capital at Philippopoli (Plovdiv); and western Rumelia was divided into the Edirne, Salonika, and Monastir ils (provinces). In 1885 Bulgaria annexed Eastern Rumelia, and by the Treaty of Bucharest (1913), Monastir was ceded to Serbia and Salonika to Greece; only Edirne remained under Ottoman rule.
In the 15th and 16th centuries Rumelia functioned as a reservoir of the devşirme (levy of Christian boys), who held the highest posts in the Ottoman army and government. Rumelia was also a centre of Ottoman Islāmic culture, which flourished in the religious schools (medreses) and mosques in Üsküb, İstip (Stip), Prizren, Pristina, Monastir, and Edirne. Islāmic mystic brotherhoods found large followings in Bulgaria, Albania, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
