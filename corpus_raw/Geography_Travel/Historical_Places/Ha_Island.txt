Ha Island, Japanese Ha-shima, also called Battleship Island, Japanese Gunkan-jima,  abandoned coal-mining centre some 3 miles (5 km) offshore, Nagasaki prefecture, northwestern Kyushu, Japan. The island, nicknamed Battleship Island (Gunkan-jima) because its silhouette resembles a battleship, was bought and developed by the Mitsubishi Mining Company in 1890. It closed in 1974. During its heyday, in the late 1950s, Ha Island’s population was about 5,200, and it was at that time among the most densely populated places on Earth. Estimates of the island’s size vary, from about 12 to 16 acres (5 to 6.5 hectares).
By the early 21st century, the structures on the island had fallen into disrepair, its reinforced-concrete buildings abandoned and crumbling. The island was reopened to visitors in 2009 and became a tourist attraction. It was also used as a backdrop for commercials and films (e.g., the James Bond thriller Skyfall [2012]). In addition, Google photographed the island in 2013, providing

. Ha Island was one of 23 Meiji-era industrial areas in Japan that were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2015, although the status was granted only after the Japanese government agreed, in response to South Korean critics, to acknowledge the use of forced labour from Korea, China, and elsewhere at those areas during World War II.
