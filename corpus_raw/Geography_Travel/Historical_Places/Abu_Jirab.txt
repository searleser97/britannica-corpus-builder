Abū Jirāb, also spelled Abu Gurab, Abu Ghurab, or Abu Gurob,  ancient Egyptian site, about 1 mile (1.6 km) north of Abū Ṣīr, between Ṣaqqārah and Al-Jīzah; it is known as the location of two 5th-dynasty (c. 2465–c. 2325 bce) sun temples. The first part of the 5th dynasty is recognized as a period of unusually strong emphasis on the worship of the sun god Re; contemporary inscriptions record that six sun temples were built in that period. Only those of King Userkaf and King Neuserre, however, have been found and excavated, the latter one being better preserved because it was constructed entirely of stone. The temple of King Neuserre consisted of a large courtyard built on the edge of the desert and surrounded by storerooms, cult chambers, and an altar. On the western side a squat obelisk rested on a rectangular podium. A long covered passage approached the platform from the Nile River valley and was decorated with some of the most beautifully sculptured and painted scenes remaining from the Old Kingdom (c. 2575–c. 2130 bce).
