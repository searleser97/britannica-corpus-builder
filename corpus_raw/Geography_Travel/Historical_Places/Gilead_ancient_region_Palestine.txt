Gilead,   area of ancient Palestine east of the Jordan River, corresponding to modern northwestern Jordan. The region is bounded in the north by the Yarmūk River and in the southwest by what were known in ancient times as the “plains of Moab”; to the east there is no definite boundary. Sometimes “Gilead” is used in a more general sense for all the region east of the Jordan River.
The name Gilead first appears in the biblical account of the last meeting of Jacob and Laban (Gen. 31:21–22). After Israel defeated Sihon, the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh were assigned to the area. Ammon and Moab, though located to the southeast and south, sometimes expanded to include parts of southern Gilead. Tiglath-pileser III established the Assyrian province of Galʿazu (Gilead) about 733 bc.
Gilead was the scene of the battle between Gideon and the Midianites and was also the home of the prophet Elijah. The “balm of Gilead” (Genesis 37:25; Jeremiah 8:22), used medicinally in antiquity, was the mastic obtained from Pistachia lentiscus; it now commonly refers to buds of a species of North American poplar (Populus) used to make cough syrups.
