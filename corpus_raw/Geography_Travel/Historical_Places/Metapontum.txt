Metapontum, Greek Metapontion,  ancient Greek city in Italy on the Gulf of Tarentum, near the mouth of the Bradanus (Bradano) River. It was founded by an Achaean colony from Sybaris and Croton about 700 bc. Pythagoras died at Metapontum c. 500. The city declined after 207 when its inhabitants, who had supported Hannibal in the years following his victory at the Battle of Cannae (216), followed the defeated Carthaginian general in his retreat.
At Metapontum are the remains of two temples, both dating from 570 to 480 bc. Of the first, probably dedicated to Apollo Lyceius, only the foundations remain; 15 columns still stand of the second temple, Tavole Paladine, which lies outside the area of the ancient city.
