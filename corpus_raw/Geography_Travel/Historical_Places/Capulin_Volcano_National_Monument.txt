Capulin Volcano National Monument,  extinct volcano in northeastern New Mexico, U.S., about 25 miles (40 km) southeast of Raton. It was established in 1916 as Capulin Mountain National Monument, its boundary changed in 1962, and it was renamed in 1987. The monument, which covers 1.2 square miles (3.1 square km), contains the cinder cone of Capulin Mountain.
The volcano became active about 62,000 years ago and last erupted some 56,000 years ago. The symmetrical cinder cone reaches an elevation of 8,182 feet (2,494 metres) above sea level and rises more than 1,300 feet (400 metres) above the surrounding grass-covered plains; its base is surrounded by lava flows. The volcanoâ€™s rim is accessible by a spiral road, and there are hiking trails inside the rim.
The mountain is largely covered in pine and juniper forest and a variety of shrubs, notably chokecherry, the Spanish name for which is capulin. Mule deer and other wildlife are found in the vicinity. The region around Capulin Volcano is an important source of archaeological material from the prehistoric Folsom culture.
