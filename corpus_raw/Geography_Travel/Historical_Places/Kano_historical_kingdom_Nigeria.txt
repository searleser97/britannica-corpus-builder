Kano,   historic kingdom and traditional emirate in northern Nigeria. According to the Kano Chronicle (1890s), the best-known native history of the Hausa people, the Kano kingdom was founded as one of the Hausa Bakwai (“Seven True Hausa States”) in 999 by Bagauda, a grandson of Bayajida (Abuyazidu), the legendary progenitor of the Hausa people. Its capital was moved from Sheme (to the north) to the present site of Kano city in King Gajemasu’s reign (1095–1134). Malinke scholars from the Mali empire introduced Islām into the region in the 1340s, and Yaji (reigned 1349–85) was probably Kano’s first Muslim Hausa king. Islām was blamed for Kano’s defeat by Zaria about 1400, and King Kanajeji renounced the faith; but in the 1450s new Malian teachers arrived, and Islām regained its influence.
In King Dauda’s reign (1421–38), Kano became a tributary state of the Bornu kingdom (to the east), and under Abdullahi Burja (1438–52) trade relations with Bornu were established. Camel caravans brought prosperity under Mohamman Rumfa (1463–99), the greatest of Kano’s Hausa kings, who established the Kurmi Market, built the Juma’at Mosque (restored) and a palace (now used by the Fulani emirs), and fought the first of a series of wars with Katsina (92 miles [148 km] northwest), Kano’s principal rival in the trans-Saharan trade. Under Rumfa, Arabic writing was reintroduced and the administration codified under Islāmic law.
Kano became a tributary state of Songhai after its capture about 1513 by Muḥammad I Askia of the Songhai empire. Later in the century, the state paid tribute to Zazzau, a Hausa kingdom to the south. After defeats in 1653 and 1671 by the Jukun (Kwararafa) people from the southeast, Kano was eclipsed by Katsina as a commercial centre. By 1734 it once again paid tribute to Bornu.
In 1804 the Fulani jihad (holy war) leader, Usman dan Fodio, led a revolt against the Hausa overlords and, in 1807, Kano city was taken. One of dan Fodio’s pupils, Sulaimanu (Sulemanu), became Kano’s first emir; his successor, Emir Ibrahim Dabo (1819–46) of the Sullibawa clan, founded the present dynasty.
By the 1820s Kano had become the greatest commercial power in West Africa. Its leather and cotton goods were widely transported northward by caravan across the Sahara to Tripoli, Tunis, and Fès, and hence to Europe, where its red goatskin products were known as morocco leather. By the 1880s, however, trade diminished because of changing political conditions along the routes, the end of the slave trade, and the arrival of Europeans on the West African coast.
When Abdurrahman (Abdu), the Fulani sultan at Sokoto (233 miles west-northwest), chose Mohamman Tukur as Kano’s emir in 1893, war broke out among the Kano Fulani. Aliyu Babba, the victor in 1894, pledged allegiance to Muhammadu Attahiru I, the new sultan; but the British captured Kano city in 1903 and named Muhammadu Abbas Abdullahi emir of Kano. Kano emirate was the largest and most populous of the emirates in Kano province, created by the British in 1903.
