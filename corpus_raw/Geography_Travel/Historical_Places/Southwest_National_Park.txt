Southwest National Park, also spelled South-West National Park,  national park in southwestern Tasmania, Australia, covering more than 2,350 square miles (6,080 square km). Together with the adjacent Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park (established in 1981), Southwest forms the core of the Tasmanian Wilderness, a World Heritage site that is perhaps the best-known wilderness area in Australia.
Marked by rugged terrain and a cold, wet climate, the park consists of several parallel highland ranges divided by wide valleys. Eucalyptus and sedges are common in the area’s rainforests. The Maatsuyker islands, which form part of the park off Tasmania’s southern shore, are the habitat of numerous seabirds and seals. The initial park was created in 1968 out of the amalgamation of Lake Pedder National Park (created in 1955) and the Huon Serpentine Impoundment, which had inundated Lake Pedder owing to the construction of a hydroelectric dam. In 1976 the park was almost doubled when the Port Davey Foreshore Preserve and the Precipitous Bluff were both added to it. In 1981 it was enlarged again, with lands about the headwaters of the Davey River, and in 1990 it subsumed Mount Bowes and areas along the Upper Weld River.
