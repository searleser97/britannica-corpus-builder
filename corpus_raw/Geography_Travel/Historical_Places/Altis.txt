Altis,   in Greek religion, the sacred grove of Zeus, or the sacred precinct in Olympia, Greece. It was an irregular quadrangular area more than 200 yards (183 m) on each side, and walled except to the north, where it was bounded by the Kronion (hill of Cronus). In it were the temples of Zeus and of Hera, his consort; the principal altars and votive offerings; the small treasuries built by various Dorian states; and the administration buildings for the Olympic Games, which were held nearby. Outside the sacred place were the stadium, hippodrome, baths, and other accommodations for visitors.
