ʿAdullam,   ancient city and modern development region, in the upper part of Ha-Shefela, central Israel. The mound of Tel ʿAdullam, or H̱orbat (“Ruins of”) ʿAdullam (Arabic: Tall Ash-Shaykh Madhkūr), 22.5 miles (36 km) southwest of Jerusalem, is generally accepted as the site of the ancient city. The earliest reference to ʿAdullam is in the book of Genesis, which tells of the activities of Judah, son of Jacob, in the area (Genesis 38). After the exodus from Egypt and the Israelite conquest, ʿAdullam was assigned to the tribe of Judah (Joshua 15:35). Later, during David’s flight from King Saul, he and his followers took refuge in the fortified caves there (1 Samuel 22:1–4). Following the division of the Jewish kingdom (10th century bc), Solomon’s son, Rehoboam, first king of Judah, fortified ʿAdullam, but it and the other fortified cities of Judah were taken by Pharaoh Sheshonk I (biblical Shishak), who ruled Egypt about 935–914 bc.
In later centuries ʿAdullam was reoccupied by the Jews after the Babylonian Exile (early 6th century bc). During the Hasmonean revolt (2nd century bc), Judas Maccabeus took the fortified city from Gorgias, one of Antiochus IV Epiphanes’ generals (2 Maccabees 12:38).
In modern Israel the name ʿAdullam is given to the planned development region in the former (1949–67) “Jerusalem corridor,” west of the capital. This hilly area, on the boundary of Ha-Shefela and the Yehuda (Judaean) Mountains, includes the ancient site. Settlement commenced in 1958; several agricultural villages and rural subcentres were established. No main regional centre was built because of the area’s proximity to Jerusalem, but most villages were clustered around three rural centres. Orchards are prominent in the northeastern part of the region, while field crops predominate in the southwest. Mixed light manufacturing has been located in some of the villages.
