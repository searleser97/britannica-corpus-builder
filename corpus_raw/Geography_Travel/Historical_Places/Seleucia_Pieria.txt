Seleucia Pieria, Greek Seleukeia,  in ancient Syria, port of Antioch and frontier fortress on the Cilician border (near modern Samandağ, Turkey), 4 miles (6 km) north of the mouth of the Orontes River. With Antioch, Apamea, and Laodicea it formed the Syrian tetrapolis. The town occupied the rocky slopes of Musa Daği, and its natural fortifications and good harbour soon made it the port for the important city of Antioch. The city was of considerable military importance during the wars between the Ptolemies and the Seleucids and was later recognized as an independent city by the Romans. It was used by them as a naval base but was later abandoned.
