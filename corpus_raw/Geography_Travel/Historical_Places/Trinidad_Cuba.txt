Trinidad,  city, central Cuba. It lies on the southern slopes of the Sierra de Trinidad, north of its Caribbean Sea port, Casilda.
Trinidad was founded in 1514 by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar. It prospered during the colonial era and for some time was Cuba’s wealthiest city. To preserve the colonial atmosphere and to honour former residents—among whom were the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt—Trinidad was declared a national monument, and in 1988 it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site with the nearby Valley de los Ingenios.
The city has numerous and varied industries, including sugar refineries, dairies, sawmills, and cigar and cigarette factories. Highways lead from Trinidad to Cienfuegos city, 50 miles (80 km) to the northwest, and to Sancti Spíritus city, 50 miles (80 km) to the east-northeast. A railroad crosses the island from Trinidad to Caibarién, on the north coast, and Trinidad has an airport. Pop. (2002) 41,293; (2011 est.) 42,700.
