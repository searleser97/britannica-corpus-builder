Samaria, also called Sebaste, modern Sabasṭiyah,  ancient town in central Palestine. It is located on a hill northwest of Nāblus in the West Bank territory under Israeli administration since 1967. Excavations (1908–10; 1931–33; 1935) revealed that the site had been occupied occasionally during the late 4th millennium bc. The city was not founded until about 880/879 bc, when Omri made it the new capital of the northern Hebrew kingdom of Israel and named it Samaria. It remained the capital until its destruction by the Assyrians in 722.
In New Testament times, Samaria was rebuilt and greatly enlarged by Herod the Great (37–4 bc), who renamed the city Sebaste in honour of the Roman emperor Augustus (Greek: Sebastos). Herod’s city included an impressive temple to Augustus, strong fortifications, and many features of Hellenistic cities.
Some of the most important remains of the Israelite period include a valuable collection of ivory carvings, which were probably from the palace of King Ahab (c. 874–c. 853 bc), and a series of ostraca (pottery or limestone inscription fragments) from the time of King Jeroboam II (8th century bc).
