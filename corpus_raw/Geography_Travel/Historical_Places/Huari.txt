Huari, also spelled Wari,  archaeological site located in the central highland region of present-day Peru that gives its name to an Andean civilization of the central and northern highlands of the Middle Horizon (c. ad 600–1000). Huari is closely linked in its art style to the monuments of the great site of Tiwanaku, located on Lake Titicaca in northwestern Bolivia. Huari was probably the centre of a militaristic empire that dominated much of the Peruvian highlands and coast during the earlier part of the Middle Horizon. Its influences are seen especially in the Late Nazca (Ica) culture of the southern coast and at Pachacamac on the central coast. The most distinctive decorative motif on Huari pottery is the Doorway God, a stylized, anthropomorphic figure often represented in front view with a rectangular face and rayed headdress. This motif is also found at Tiwanaku. Huari architecture features large enclosures constructed of stone masonry. Monumental temple sculpture is naturalistic and depicts both male and female figures with elaborate hairstyles. Turquoise miniatures ranging in size from 0.5 to 4 inches (1 to 10 cm) have also been found. Huari skill in metalwork is illustrated by gold masks and a copper statue of an anthropomorphic feline. The wealthy were buried in stone tombs.
The Huari site was first settled in the Huarpa phase, which dates to the Early Intermediate Period (c. 200 bc–ad 600); but the expansion of the site to its impressive urban dimensions corresponds with the Tiwanaku-influenced Huari phase proper of the Middle Horizon, the time at which the leaders of Huari embarked on a course of imperial expansion.
