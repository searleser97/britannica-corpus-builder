Goldfield,  mining ghost town, seat (1907) of Esmeralda county, southwestern Nevada, U.S., in desert country south of Tonopah. It was the site of a gold rush that began in 1902 and lasted until 1918. In 1910 the production of ore reached an all-time high, valued at more than $11 million. Federal troops were stationed in the town during a bitter labour struggle (1907–08) between the miners and the operators. After 1918 Goldfield’s population declined rapidly from an estimated 40,000 in 1910 to fewer than 200; a fire in 1923 destroyed much of the town’s original centre. The 200-room Goldfield Hotel was closed except for a brief period during World War II when it accommodated servicemen at an air force station located a few miles north; the imposing structure stands empty today. To the southeast is the vast Nellis Air Force Range and Nuclear Testing Site. Tourism keeps the 400 people still living in Goldfield in business.
