Moab,  kingdom, ancient Palestine. Located east of the Dead Sea in what is now west-central Jordan, it was bounded by Edom and the land of the Amorites. The Moabites were closely related to the Israelites, and the two were frequently in conflict. The Moabite Stone, found at Dibon, recorded the 9th-century-bce victories of the Moab king Mesha, especially those over Israel. Moab was conquered by the Babylonians in 582 bce.
