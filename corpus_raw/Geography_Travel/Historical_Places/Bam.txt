Bam,  city in eastern Kermān province, Iran. The city, an agricultural centre situated on the Silk Road and long famed for its large fortress, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004.
Bam is located about 115 miles (185 km) southeast of the city of Kermān at an elevation of approximately 3,600 feet (1,100 metres) on the banks of the Bam River. The region around the city has long been known for its date palms, which are among the most productive in Iran, although cotton and various grains are also raised there.
The modern city is located immediately to the south of the site of the ancient citadel (arg) Arg-e Bam, once one of the world’s largest mud-brick complexes. Located on a hilltop, the citadel consisted of a series of three concentric walls made of mud brick and palm timbers, the outer wall of which enclosed the old city. Bam’s highest point, the citadel proper, rose to about 200 feet (60 metres) above its base. The walls of the fortress, some 40 feet (12 metres) high, were once surrounded by a deep moat. The citadel was established during the Sāsānian dynasty (224–651 ce); even as late as the beginning of the 19th century, it was the strongest fortified place in Iran, having been used most extensively during the Iranian dynastic disputes of the 18th and 19th centuries. During that same period, the fortress fell into the hands of invading Afghan armies, and much of the population fled.
By the late 19th century the establishment of secure borders and a strong centralized state made such a military stronghold obsolete. The old city site was abandoned by the end of the century, though the fortress continued to be used as a military garrison until the 1930s. Beginning in the 1950s, the Iranian government began to restore the fortress, but in 2003 the region around Bam was struck by a massive earthquake that killed more than 26,000 people and devastated the modern city, and the fortress itself was largely destroyed. Pop. (2006) 75,215.
