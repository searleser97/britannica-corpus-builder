Cholula, in full Cholula de Riva Dabia or Cholula de Rivadavia,  city, northwestern Puebla estado (state), central Mexico. It lies on the Mesa Central at 7,052 feet (2,149 metres) above sea level, just northwest of Puebla city, the state capital. Cholula (Nahuatl: “Place of Springs”), an important pre-Spanish-conquest town dedicated to the god Quetzalcóatl, is known for its many domed churches, for the Spaniards built a church on top of each native temple. The preservation of these religious structures led to the city of Cholula’s being designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.
Cholula was a major centre of the preconquest Mesoamerican Indian culture as far back as the Early Classic Period (100–600 ce) and reached its maximum growth in the Late Classic Period (600–900). An imposing pyramid there of sun-dried bricks, the largest structure built by Mesoamerican Indians, dates from the Late Classic. The pyramid is 177 feet (54 metres) high and covers nearly 45 acres (18 hectares). Any historical data in the temple of Quetzalcóatl that once crowned the pyramid (now topped by the Christian chapel Nuestra Señora de los Remedios) was doubtless destroyed in 1519 by Hernán Cortés, who also massacred thousands of Cholulans before embarking on his march inland to conquer Montezuma II’s capital, Tenochtitlán (now Mexico City). The Cholulans, who were makers and traders of textiles and pottery, were Nahuatl speakers and at the time of the conquest owed a nominal allegiance to Montezuma.
In addition to its role as a pilgrimage and tourist centre, Cholula processes agricultural products—cereals, maguey (a Mexican agave), fruits, vegetables, and livestock. Wine and liquor are produced in the city, and there are flour and textile mills. It is the site of the University of the Americas (1940), which moved to Cholula from Mexico City in 1970. Cholula is accessible by railroad and highway. Pop. (2000) 99,794; (2011) 87,897.
