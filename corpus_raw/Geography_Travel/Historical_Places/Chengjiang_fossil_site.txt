Chengjiang fossil site, also called Chengjiang Maotianshan Shales,  formation in China containing fossils dating to the Terreneuvian Epoch of the Cambrian Period (541 million to 521 million years ago). Comprising a 512 hectare- (1,265-acre-) parcel of hilly terrain in Yunnan province, the site is one of the most-important fossil formations showing evidence of the rapid diversification of life on Earth during the Cambrian explosion. Since it was discovered in the 1980s, approximately 200 species of hard- and soft-tissued fossils have been recovered from the bed. In 2012 it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
The excellent condition of the fossils is attributed to the fact that the fossil bed was once a shallow sea that possessed a muddy substrate. It is thought that mud and sediment from the sea covered the remains and formed mudstone, which prevented or greatly slowed the decomposition of the dead material.
The Chengjiang fossil site contains representatives from at least 16 phyla. It harbours evidence of an early Cambrian marine community that contained sponges, cnidarians (a group that contains present-day sea anemones, jellyfish, and others), ctenophores (comb jellies), and priapulids (marine unsegmented worms). The site also contains the earliest known vertebrates and possibly the oldest chordates in the fossil record. Some of the more-notable groups uncovered include echinoderms, trilobites, and the first agnathans, or primitive jawless fishes. In addition, a number of unclassified specimens also appear, along with the oldest known soft-tissue specimens (brain tissues from the marine arthropod Fuxianhuia protensa, which have been dated to roughly 520 million years ago). Scientists have noted that since many of the species found at Chengjiang were part of the same food chain, the marine community serves as one of the oldest examples of a complex ecosystem.
