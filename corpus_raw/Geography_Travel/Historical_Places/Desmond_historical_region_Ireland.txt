Desmond, Old Irish Des-muma (South Munster),  an ancient territorial division of Ireland approximating the modern counties of Kerry and Cork. Between the 11th and 17th centuries, the name was often used for two quite distinct areas. Gaelic Desmond extended over the modern County Kerry south of the River Maine and over the modern County Cork west and north of the city of Cork; Anglo-Norman Desmond extended over north Kerry from the River Maine, over most of the modern county of Limerick, southwest Tipperary, east and south County Cork, and east Waterford. In 1329 Maurice Fitzgerald was created earl of Desmond, and his descendants became almost independent rulers during the 15th century. His line ended in 1601, and the earldom was eventually granted to a member of the English family of Feilding, from 1675 being held in conjunction with that of Denbigh.
