Bit-Adini,   ancient Aramaean kingdom in Mesopotamia, located on both sides of the middle Euphrates River south of Carchemish. Probably founded in the 10th century bc, it was conquered by the Assyrians under Shalmaneser III in 856. Its capital, Til Barsib (Til Barsip; modern Tall al-Aá¸¥mar), was renamed Kar-Shulmanashared (Quay of Shalmaneser) and was made an Assyrian provincial capital and garrison town. Til Barsib was later captured by the Chaldean king Nabopolassar in 611, and thereafter it never regained its former importance.
