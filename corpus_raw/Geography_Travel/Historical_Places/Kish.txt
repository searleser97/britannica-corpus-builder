Kish, modern Tall al-Uhaimer,  ancient Mesopotamian city-state located east of Babylon in what is now south-central Iraq. According to ancient Sumerian sources it was the seat of the first postdiluvian dynasty; most scholars believe that the dynasty was at least partly historical. A king of Kish, Mesilim, is known to have been the author of the earliest extant royal inscription, in which he recorded his arbitration of a boundary dispute between the south Babylonian cities of Lagash and Umma. The dynasty ended when its last king, Agga, was defeated about 2660 by Gilgamesh, king of the first dynasty of Uruk. Although Kish continued to be important throughout most of ancient Mesopotamian history, it was never able to regain its earlier prominence.
