Kosala,  ancient kingdom of northern India, roughly corresponding to the historical region of Oudh, in what is now south-central Uttar Pradesh state. Kosala extended across both banks of the Sarayu (modern Ghaghara) River and north into what is now Nepal. According to the Hindu epic the Ramayana, Kosala was ruled by kings descended from the Sun; one of these kings was Rama, whose capital was Ayodhya (Oudh), near modern Faizabad.
Kosala rose in political importance early in the 6th century bce to become one of the 16 states dominant in northern India. It annexed the powerful kingdom of Kashi. About 500 bce, during the reign of King Prasenajit (Pasenadi), it was regarded as one of the four powers of the north—perhaps the dominant power. At that time Kosala could command the trade routes of the Ganges (Ganga) River basin. The Buddha, who was born in the Shakya (Sakiya) tribe of northern Kosala (c. 563 bce), often preached at the capital city of Shravasti (Savatthi), where he passed the rainy season during the last 25 years of his life.
There had been a matrimonial alliance between Kosala and Magadha, but about 490 bce war broke out between them. As a result, Kosala seemed to have been weakened and never regained its position of control. Kosala was absorbed into Magadha sometime during the reign of the latter’s king Ajatashatru (c. 491–c. 459 bce).
In later times Kosala was known as Northern Kosala, to distinguish it from a large kingdom to the south known variously as Kosala, Southern Kosala, or Great Kosala, on the upper Mahanadi River (now in eastern Madhya Pradesh state). This latter kingdom, with its capital at Sripura (later Sripur, Raipur), was founded, according to the Ramayana, by Rama’s son Kusha and was known by this name until the 12th century ce.
