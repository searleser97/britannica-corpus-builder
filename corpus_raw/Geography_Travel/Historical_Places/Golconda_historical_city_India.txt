Golconda, also spelled Golkonda or Golkunda,  historic fortress and ruined city lying 5 miles (8 km) west of Hyderabad in western Telangana state, southern India. From 1518 to 1591 it was the capital of the Quṭb Shāhī kingdom (1518–1687), one of five Muslim sultanates of the Deccan.
The territory of Golconda lay between the lower reaches of the Godavari and Krishna rivers and extended to the Bay of Bengal coast. In 1687 the ruling dynasty of Quṭb Shāhī was overthrown by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, and Golconda was annexed to the Mughal Empire (1526–1857). The fortress is 3 miles (5 km) in circumference, with concentric masonry block walls. Palaces, mosques, and the Quṭb Shāhī tombs still remain intact and are a major tourist attraction. Historically, the Golconda region was renowned for its diamonds, derived from the conglomerate rocks of the nearby hills, including the world-famous Koh-i-noor diamond.
