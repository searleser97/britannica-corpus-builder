Cuenca,  city, capital of Cuenca provincia (province), in the comunidad autónoma (autonomous community) of Castile–La Mancha, east-central Spain. It lies on a pyramid-like hill above the confluence of the Júcar and Huécar rivers. Originally the Roman Conca, the city was captured from the Moors in 1177 by Alfonso VIII of Castile, who made it an episcopal see in 1182. It served as a cultural and textile centre in the Middle Ages. During the 19th century the city expanded onto nearby lowland and in fact became two cities: the upper, old city and the lower, modern one close to the railway from Madrid. Viewed from below, the Casas Colgantes (“Hanging Houses”) of the old city appear to be suspended. The old city was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1996. The Romanesque-Gothic cathedral (13th century) is notable, and the city is the site of the Provincial Archaeological and Spanish Abstract Art museums.
Cuenca has a considerable trade in timber. Industrial development is slight (tanning, sawmilling, paper milling, and flour milling); manufactured goods include furniture, soap, leather, and woolen goods. Local commerce and services are Cuenca’s main economic activities. Pop. (2007 est.) 52,980.
