Oldenburg,   former German state, successively a countship, a duchy, a grand duchy, and a Land (state) before it became a Regierungsbezirk (administrative district) of Lower Saxony Land in West Germany in 1946. As a result of the administrative reorganization in 1977, Oldenburg became part of the Weser-Ems administrative district.
At its greatest extent, between 1854 and 1937, Oldenburg had an area of 2,480 square miles (6,423 square km), comprising the main body of the territory and two exclaves, Lübeck-Eutin (209 square miles [541 square km]) and Birkenfeld (194 square miles [502 square km]). At this time the main body of Oldenburg lay on the lowlands of the North Sea and was encircled landward by Hanover (Prussian from 1866), except for a short frontier in the east with Bremen. Its capital was Oldenburg on the lower Hunte River. Wilhelmshaven, bought by Prussia in 1853, was restored to Oldenburg in 1937, and Lübeck-Eutin and Birkenfeld were transferred to Schleswig-Holstein and the Prussian Rhine province, respectively.
From the early 12th century, a line of counts established themselves at Oldenburg, which developed into a city. Count Christian of Oldenburg was elected to the Danish throne in 1448; he was also king of Norway from 1450 and king of Sweden for a few years from 1457, and he acquired the duchy of Schleswig and the county of Holstein in 1460. In 1454 he ceded Oldenburg to his brother Gerhard, whose descendants acquired nearby lordships. For his neutrality in the Thirty Years’ War, Count Anton Günther received from Emperor Ferdinand II the right to collect tolls from ships passing Elsfleth on the Weser. When Gerhard’s line died out in 1667, the territory passed to the Danish crown. In 1773 Christian VII of Denmark ceded Oldenburg to his distant cousin Paul, the future emperor of Russia, in exchange for the latter’s title to Holstein-Gottorp. Paul soon ceded it to his cousin Frederick Augustus, who held the bishopric of Lübeck and who was then created duke of Oldenburg by the Holy Roman emperor Joseph II. The principality of Birkenfeld was ceded to Oldenburg in 1817. Oldenburg became a grand duchy in the 19th century. It joined the Zollverein (German Customs Union) in 1853, favoured Prussia in the Seven Weeks’ War (1866), and joined the North German Confederation in 1867 and the German Reich in 1871. With the adoption of the Weimar Constitution in 1919, the grand ducal regime was replaced by an elected Land government. In 1933 Adolf Hitler made Oldenburg the centre of a large Gau (administrative district). After World War II, Oldenburg was merged with Lower Saxony Land.
