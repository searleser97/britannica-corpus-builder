Agri Decumates,   in antiquity, the Black Forest and adjoining areas of what is now southwestern Germany between the Rhine, Danube, and Main rivers. The name may imply earlier occupation by a tribe with 10 cantons. The Romans under the Flavian emperors began annexing the area in ad 74 to secure better communications between the Rhine and Danube armies. According to Tacitus, the territory was previously inhabited by the Helvetii; later, Gauls settled there. The Romans were displaced from the Agri Decumates by the Alemanni in about ad 260.
