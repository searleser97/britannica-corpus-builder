Belovezhskaya Forest, also called Belovezh Forest and Białowieża Forest, Belarusian Byelavyezhskaya Pushcha, Polish Puszcza Białowieska,  forest in western Belarus and eastern Poland. One of the largest surviving areas of primeval mixed forest (pine, beech, oak, alder, and spruce) in Europe, it occupies more than 460 square miles (1,200 square km). The Belovezhskaya Forest is located near the headwaters of the Narev (Polish: Narew) and Lesnaya (Leśna) rivers, tributaries of the Bug. The forest has a wide range of flora (some conifers and hardwoods have attained ages of 350 to 600 or more years and reached heights in excess of 150 feet [45 metres], with diameters greater than 6 feet [2 metres]) and fauna (including elk, deer, lynx, and wild boar) from both western and eastern Europe. Hunted into extinction in the wild after World War I, the European bison, or wisent, was reintroduced to the Belovezhskaya with zoo-bred animals. The forest remains the European bison’s most notable home, though the animals are now also found again in other parts of Europe, including Lithuania, Russia, and Ukraine. Once the hunting grounds of kings and tsars, the Belovezhskaya is the oldest nature preserve in Europe. Both the Polish and Belarusian portions of the forest have become national parks, and both areas were designated as World Heritage sites (the Polish portion in 1979 and the Belarusian portion in 1992).
