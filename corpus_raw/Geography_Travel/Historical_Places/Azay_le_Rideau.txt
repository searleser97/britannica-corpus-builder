Azay-le-Rideau,  town and château, Indre-et-Loire département, Centre région, central France. The town lies along the Indre River a few miles upstream from its confluence with the Loire River, about 15 miles (24 km) southwest of Tours.
Originally the site of a Roman villa, the town was known in the 12th century as Azayum. When the French dauphin (later Charles VII) was insulted by the Burgundian guard as he passed through the town in 1418, he had the captain and his 350 soldiers executed and the town put to the torch. For the next 100 years it was thus known as Azay-le-Brûlé (“Azay the Burnt”).
The town is built at the foot of a hill by the river and is a maze of narrow, twisting streets. Azay-le-Rideau is best known for a splendid château that is one of the finest examples of French architecture in the 16th century. The château was built (1518–29) by Gilles Berthelot, whose wife, Philippa, directed the work. Partly constructed on piles, it projects out into the Indre River. The château is surrounded by a wooded park and is an elegant Renaissance building, two stories high, with turrets and sharply pointed roofs. State-owned since 1905, it is now furnished as a Renaissance museum. Tourism plays a key role in the local economy. Pop. (1999) 3,100; (2014 est.) 3,435.
