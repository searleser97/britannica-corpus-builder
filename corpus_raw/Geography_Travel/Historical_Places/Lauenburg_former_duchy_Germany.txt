Lauenburg,   former duchy of northern Germany, stretching from south of Lübeck to the Elbe and bounded on the west and east, respectively, by the former duchies of Holstein and Mecklenburg, an area that since 1946 has been part of the federal Land (state) of Schleswig-Holstein.
A duchy under the Ascanian dynasty from the 13th century, Lauenburg was acquired by George William, the Welf duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Celle, in 1702. In 1728 his nephew George Louis, elector of Hanover and, as George I, king of Great Britain and Ireland, was recognized as heir by Emperor Charles VI; thus, Lauenburg became attached to Hanover. The Congress of Vienna (1814–15) awarded it to Prussia, which granted it to Denmark in exchange for the previously Swedish part of Pomerania. After the Danish–Prussian War of 1864, it passed to Prussia; Prussia’s king, William I, became duke of Lauenburg. Lauenburg was integrated into Prussia’s Schleswig-Holstein in 1876. Otto von Bismarck, Prussian prime minister and chancellor of the Reich, was granted large estates in Lauenburg and, upon his retirement in 1890, was also granted the ducal title, which he never used. The duchy was abolished in 1918.
