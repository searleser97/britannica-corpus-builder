Moyen-Congo,   (French: “Middle Congo”), one of the four territories comprising French Equatorial Africa, the origins of which derive from the establishment in 1880 by the explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza of a station at Ntamo. From 1934 Moyen-Congo was directly administered by the governor-general of French Equatorial Africa. It was granted independent status as the Congo Republic in 1960 and was subsequently renamed the People’s Republic of the Congo, abbreviated Congo (Brazzaville).
