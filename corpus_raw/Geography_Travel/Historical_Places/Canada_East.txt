Canada East, also called Lower Canada,  in Canadian history, the region in Canada that corresponds with modern southern Quebec.
 From 1791 to 1841 the region was known as Lower Canada and from 1841 to 1867 as Canada East, though the two names continued to be used interchangeably.
Settled primarily by French Canadians who wanted to preserve their distinctive identity and cultural traditions, Canada East was reluctant to join the proposed confederation with Canada West. They finally agreed to confederation in 1867 because Canada East would remain a territorial and governmental unit (as Quebec) in which French Canadians would have an assured electoral majority and thus be able to at least partly control their own affairs. The champion of confederation in Canada East was George E. Cartier, who was instrumental in bringing about confederation.
