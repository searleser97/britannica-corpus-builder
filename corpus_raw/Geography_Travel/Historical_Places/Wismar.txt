Wismar,  city, Mecklenburg–West Pomerania Land (state), northern Germany. It lies along Wismar Bay (Wismarbucht), an inlet of the Baltic Sea, east of Lübeck. First mentioned in 1229, it was chartered before 1250. Wismar was a member of the Hanseatic League, with most of its trade in herring and beer. In 1648 it passed to Sweden, which did not renounce its claims to the city until 1903, although Wismar was administered by Mecklenburg-Schwerin state after 1803. Many historic buildings were destroyed in World War II, but the medieval town centre remains, with several brick-constructed buildings; the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2002.
Wismar’s channel and port facilities were greatly extended after World War II, and important new shipbuilding yards were established; these yards were modernized following German reunification. Wismar is a road and rail junction; its industries produce motor-vehicle parts, furniture, machinery, metal products, precision instruments, and foodstuffs. Tourism is also important. Pop. (2003 est.) 45,714.
