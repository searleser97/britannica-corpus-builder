Bet Alfa, also spelled Beit Alpha or Beit Alfa,  ancient site in northeastern Israel, noted for the remains of a synagogue (founded 6th century ad) that was discovered in 1928 by kibbutz workers digging drainage ditches. The kibbutz was founded in 1922 by Polish Jewish immigrants, who revived the historical name of Bet Alfa for their settlement.
Little remains of the synagogue building (which was thoroughly excavated in 1929) except the floor and wall outlines. The mosaic floor, in three panels, depicts an ark, the signs of the zodiac, and the sacrifice of Isaac. The building was probably destroyed by an earthquake in the 6th century.
