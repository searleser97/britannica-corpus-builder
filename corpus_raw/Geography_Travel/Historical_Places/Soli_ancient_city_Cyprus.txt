Soli, Greek Soloi,  ancient Greek city on Cyprus, located west of modern Karavostasi on Morphou Bay. Soli traditionally was founded after the Trojan War by the Attic hero Acamas, perhaps reflecting the Sea Peoplesâ€™ occupation of Cyprus (c. 1193 bc). According to another legend, however, the city was named for the Athenian lawgiver Solon (flourished 6th century bc), who was supposed to have visited Cyprus. Soli was probably an ally of Assyria in the 7th century bc. In Hellenic times the city had little political importance, though its copper mines were famous. Excavated monuments include a theatre, a temple of Aphrodite and Isis, and a 5th-century palace situated 5 miles (8 km) west of the town at Vouni.
