Laodicea,   the ancient name of several cities of western Asia, mostly founded or rebuilt in the 3rd century bc by rulers of the Seleucid dynasty, and named after Laodice, the mother of Seleucus I Nicator, or after Laodice, daughter (or possibly niece) of Antiochus I Soter and wife of Antiochus II Theos. Established as commercial centres on newly opened or reconditioned trade routes, or as strongholds for the pacification of parts of the Seleucid empire, the cities aided in the Hellenization of western Asia and subsequently in the spread of Christianity in the region.
The most important of the cities was Laodicea ad Lycum (near modern Denizli, Turkey); its church was one of the seven to which Saint John addressed the Revelation. Laodicea ad Mare (modern Latakia, Syria) was a major seaport.
