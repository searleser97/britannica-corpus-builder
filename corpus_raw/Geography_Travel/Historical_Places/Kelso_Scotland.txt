Kelso,  small burgh (town) and agricultural market centre, Scottish Borders council area, historic county of Roxburghshire, southeastern Scotland. It lies on the River Tweed at the head of the Merse, a rich agricultural plain south of the Lammermuir Hills. The town’s centrepiece is its large cobbled square, noted for its legacy as a market and livestock auction destination.
Like many of its neighbours, medieval Kelso suffered from border warfare with the English. The abbey was founded by King David I of Scotland (reigned 1124–53). Completed in the mid-13th century, it became one of the most powerful in Scotland, but it suffered damage in English raids and was reduced to ruins in 1545. The transept functioned as the parish church until 1771, and one vault was used as the town jail. The abbey was presented to the nation in 1919 by the duke of Roxburgh, and restoration was undertaken.
Medieval Kelso was overshadowed by the nearby castle and flourishing royal burgh of Roxburgh, a favourite royal residence and prosperous town. After Roxburgh Castle’s final destruction in 1460, the Scottish kings abandoned Roxburgh in favour of the rising burgh of Kelso, which had its royal status confirmed in 1634. After the erection of a bridge over the River Tweed in 1754, Kelso became a stop on the important London-to-Edinburgh coach route. John Rennie’s new five-arched bridge over the Tweed in 1803 was his model for the famous London Bridge (1811). Waterfront attractions along the Tweed, as well as the nearby Floors Castle, have made the town a tourist destination.  Pop. (2001) 6,190; (2011) 6,860.
