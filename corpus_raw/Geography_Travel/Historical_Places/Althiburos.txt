Althiburos, modern Abbah Quṣūr, also spelled Ebba Ksour,  ancient city of Numidia in North Africa, on the road constructed by the Roman emperor Hadrian in 123 ce, between Carthage and Theveste (Tébessa) in what is now Tunisia and Algeria, respectively. The town, originally an indigenous settlement, obtained municipal rights from Hadrian.
Althiburos enjoyed considerable prosperity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries ce and was the seat of a bishop from about 400 to 700. Because the town was deserted for nearby Ebba Ksour, its most important buildings have survived. These include a well-preserved triumphal arch and the ancient forum with its surrounding buildings, including two temples, an arch erected in honour of Hadrian, and a theatre. Knowledge of the history of Althiburos is based on the reports of 18th-century tourists and some sporadic excavations.
