Clazomenae,   ancient Ionian Greek city, located about 20 miles west of Izmir (Smyrna) in modern Turkey. It was founded on the mainland near the base of the Erythraean peninsula; it became part of the Ionian Dodecapolis and was well known for its painted terra-cotta sarcophagi (6th century bc). Later, its inhabitants, alarmed by Persian encroachments, moved the city to an island 400 yards from the coast. Alexander the Great built a pier to connect the island to the mainland. During the 5th century bc, the city was controlled by Athens; it revolted in 412 and after a period of party strife became subject to Achaemenidian Persia (387 bc). The Romans incorporated it into the province of Asia. The philosopher Anaxagoras and Periclesâ€™ siege engineer Artemon were natives of Clazomenae.
