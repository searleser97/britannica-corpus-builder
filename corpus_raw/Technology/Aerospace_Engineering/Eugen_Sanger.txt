Eugen Sänger,  (born Sept. 22, 1905, Pressnitz, near Komotau, Austria-Hungary—died  Feb. 10, 1964, Berlin), German rocket propulsion engineer whose projected “antipodal bomber,” with a range far greater than that made possible by its fuel capacity alone, greatly interested the major Western governments and the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. The development of long-range missiles and the difficulties of high-altitude precision bombing with the antipodal craft discouraged the building of Sänger’s bomber.
After experimenting successfully with a small rocket motor burning light fuel oil, Sänger in 1933 designed a stratosphere rocket aircraft. He directed the Trauen rocket program of the German Aviation Research Institute (1936–45), worked for the French armament ministry (1946–54), directed the Institute of Jet Propulsion Physics, Stuttgart (1954–63), and taught at the West Berlin Technological University (1963–64).
