Frederick Emmons Terman,  (born June 7, 1900, English, Indiana, U.S.—died December 19, 1982, Palo Alto, California), American electrical engineer known for his contributions to electronics research and antiradar technology.
Terman, the son of the noted psychologist Lewis Madison Terman, earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in chemistry and chemical engineering, respectively, from Stanford University and a doctorate in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1924). From 1925 to 1941 he designed a course of study and research in electronics at Stanford that focused on work with vacuum tubes, circuits, and instrumentation.
During World War II Terman directed a staff of more than 850 at the Radio Research Laboratory at Harvard University; this organization was the source of Allied jammers to block enemy radar, tunable receivers to detect radar signals, and aluminum strips (“chaff”) to produce spurious reflections on enemy radar receivers. These countermeasures significantly reduced the effectiveness of radar-directed antiaircraft fire.
After the war Terman was appointed dean of engineering at Stanford, and from 1955 to 1965 he served as provost of the university. His efforts there did much to make Stanford the nucleus of California’s emerging high-technology economy, culminating in the growth of Silicon Valley. His other scientific contributions include work on long-distance electrical transmission and resonant transmission lines. From its initial publication in 1932 until the 1960s, Terman’s Radio Engineering was the leading book in its field.
