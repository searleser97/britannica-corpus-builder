André-Jacques Garnerin,  (born Jan. 31, 1769, Paris, France—died  Aug. 18, 1823, Paris), French aeronaut, the first person to use a parachute regularly and successfully. He perfected the parachute and made jumps from greater altitudes than had been possible before.
As a young man Garnerin studied physics. In 1793 he became an inspector in the French army, where he encouraged the use of balloons for military purposes, but he was captured during hostilities with England and was imprisoned for two years. On his return to France he began to make balloon ascents, giving his first exhibition of parachuting in Paris in 1797, when he jumped from a height of about 3,200 feet (1,000 m). Garnerin continued his exhibitions in cities throughout northern Europe, making a spectacular jump from 8,000 feet (2,440 m) in 1802, in England. His white canvas parachute was umbrella-shaped and approximately 23 feet (7 m) in diameter. In most of his aeronautical enterprises, he worked with his brother Jean-Baptiste-Olivier Garnerin (1766–1849).
