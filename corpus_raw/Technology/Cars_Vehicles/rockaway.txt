Rockaway,   a light, low, four-wheeled, horse-drawn carriage popular in the United States after its introduction at Rockaway, N.J., in 1830. It had a driver’s seat built into the body, with the top projecting forward to protect the driver from inclement weather. The main body was of the coupé type and was suspended on elliptic springs made of several layers of curved flat steel.
In about 1870 the term depot wagon was applied to many carriages of the rockaway type, and by 1890 the term station wagon was also in use, though there were few, if any, differences between them. They were made until the end of the 19th century, and the style was carried over into many early automobiles.
