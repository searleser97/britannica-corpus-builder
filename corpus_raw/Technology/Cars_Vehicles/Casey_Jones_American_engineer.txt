Casey Jones, byname of John Luther Jones,  (born March 14, 1864, southeastern Missouri, U.S.—died  April 30, 1900, near Vaughan, Miss.), American railroad engineer whose death as celebrated in the ballad “Casey Jones” made him a folk hero.
When Jones was in his teens, his family moved across the Mississippi River to Cayce, Ky., the town name (pronounced the same as Casey) providing his nickname. An engineer with a penchant for speed and virtuoso use of the whistle, he was making up time when his fireman warned him of a train ahead. After telling the fireman to jump, Casey died in the collision, one hand on the brake, the other on the whistle. An engine wiper, Wallace Saunders, wrote the first ballad about him. Another version was published by Lawrence Siebert and Eddie Newton in 1909 and became a popular hit in vaudeville. Other versions appear in railroad, construction, hobo, radical, and World War I song collections, and there are versions in French, German, and Afrikaans. Later versions transferred Casey to Western railroads, and some made him into a roistering ladies’ man, to his widow’s distress.
