Charles Renard,  (born 1847, France—died  1905, France), French military engineer, chief builder of the first true dirigible; i.e., an airship that could be steered in any direction irrespective of wind and could return under its own power to its point of departure. In 1884 Renard and Arthur Krebs, French Army captains at the Aérostation Militaire, Chalais-Meudon, completed the dirigible “La France,” which on August 9 of that year made its first flight, a circular journey of 7 or 8 kilometres (about 4 to 5 miles). Earlier (1871) Renard had flown a pilotless heavier-than-air craft, a 10-winged model glider.
