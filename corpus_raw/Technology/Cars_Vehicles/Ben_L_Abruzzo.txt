Ben L. Abruzzo,  (born June 9, 1930, Rockford, Ill., U.S.—died Feb. 11, 1985, Albuquerque, N.M.), American balloonist who, with three crewmates, made the first transpacific balloon flight and the longest nonstop balloon flight, in the Double Eagle V.
Abruzzo graduated from the University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana) in 1952 and served two years in the U.S. Air Force at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, N.M. (1952–54). He settled in Albuquerque and became a real-estate developer, eventually becoming the owner of two well-known ski resorts, one near Albuquerque and the other near Santa Fe. He, as well as his wife and children, became active in skiing, boating, sailing, tennis, flying, and ballooning. In 1978 Abruzzo, with Maxie Anderson and Larry Newman, made the first transatlantic balloon flight in the Double Eagle II. In 1979 Abruzzo and Anderson won the Gordon Bennett race in the Double Eagle III.
The transpacific flight, with Abruzzo as captain and teammates Larry Newman and Ron Clark, both of Albuquerque, and Rocky Aoki, a Japanese American restaurateur from Miami, who partly financed the flight, was launched from Nagashima, Japan, on Nov. 9, 1981. The balloon landed, 84 hr 31 min later, in the Mendocino National Forest in California on November 12. The flight covered 5,768 miles (9,244 km), the longest balloon flight in history.
Abruzzo was the holder of nine world ballooning records, more than any other balloonist, at the time he and his wife, along with four companions, died in the crash of a small plane that he was piloting. His children carried on the family businesses, and his son Richard became a prominent balloonist in his own right. Richard Abruzzo and ballooning partner Carol Rymer Davis, a prominent Denver radiologist, won the 2004 Gordon Bennett race, but both were killed in September 2010, during that year’s Bennett race, when their balloon crashed into the Adriatic Sea.
