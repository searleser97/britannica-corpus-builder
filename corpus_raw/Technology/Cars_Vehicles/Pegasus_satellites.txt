Pegasus,  any of a series of three U.S. scientific satellites launched in 1965. These spacecraft were named for the winged horse in Greek mythology because of their prominent winglike structure. This “wing,” which spanned 29 metres (96 feet), was designed to record the depth and frequency with which it was pierced by micrometeoroids. The information was used to design the outer shell of the crewed Apollo spacecraft to prevent penetration of such high-speed particles of space dust. The data also helped engineers develop space suits that would shield astronauts from micrometeoroids when working outside their spacecraft. At the time of their launch, the Pegasus satellites were among the largest U.S. spacecraft ever built, with their centre section extending 21.6 metres (71 feet) in length.
