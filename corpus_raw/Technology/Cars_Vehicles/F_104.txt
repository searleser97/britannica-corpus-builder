F-104, also called Starfighter,  jet day fighter aircraft built by Lockheed Aircraft Corporation for the U.S. Air Force but adopted by a total of 15 NATO and other countries. It was widely adapted for use as a fighter-bomber. The F-104 had a wingspan of 21 feet 11 inches (6.68 m) and a length of 54 feet 9 inches (16.7 m). It was a single-seat, single-engine midwing monoplane, powered with a General Electric J79 series turbojet engine with afterburner delivering 15,800 pounds of thrust. Its normal top speed was about Mach 2.1 (i.e., about 1,550 miles per hour [2,500 km/h]) at 35,000 feet (11,000 m). In special efforts the F-104 set a series of world records (later broken) of speeds in excess of 1,400 miles per hour (2,253 km/h) and altitudes well above 100,000 feet (30,000 m).
It saw first-line use by the U.S. Air Force beginning in 1958â€“60. More than 2,400 were eventually produced. Most other countries began replacing the F-104 in the late 1970s. It was armed with an internal six-barreled 20-millimetre cannon and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles with various alternative combinations of bombs and missiles on wing pylons and fuselage.
