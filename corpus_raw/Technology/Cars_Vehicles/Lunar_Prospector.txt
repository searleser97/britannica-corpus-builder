Lunar Prospector,  U.S. space probe that studied the chemistry of the Moon’s surface. Lunar Prospector was launched on Jan. 6, 1998, by an Athena II rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It entered lunar orbit on January 11 and achieved its final mapping orbit, 100 km (60 miles) high, four days later.
Lunar Prospector carried a neutron spectrometer to investigate the composition of the topmost layer of lunar soil, the regolith, within about 1 metre (3 feet) of the surface. Neutrons originating underground because of radioactivity and cosmic-ray bombardment interact with the nuclei of elements in the regolith en route to space, where they can be detected from orbit. A neutron loses more energy in an interaction with a light nucleus than with a heavy one, so the observed neutron spectrum can reveal whether light elements, particularly hydrogen, are present in the regolith. Lunar Prospector gave clear indications of hydrogen concentrations at both poles, in craters protected from sunlight, interpreted as proof of excess hydrogen atoms bound in water ice. Such water would represent a major resource for future interplanetary missions. The water could be electrolyzed into oxygen (valuable as a rocket oxidizer and for crew air) and hydrogen (valuable as a rocket fuel).
Lunar Prospector also mapped the Moon’s gravitational field. It discovered three mascons on the near side of the Moon and showed that the Moon could have an iron core about 600 km (400 miles) in diameter. Lunar Prospector was deliberately crashed into a crater in the south polar region on July 31, 1999, by using the last of its propellant. Telescopes on and around Earth watched for spectral signatures unique to water but found none.
