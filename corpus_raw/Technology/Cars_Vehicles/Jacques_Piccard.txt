Jacques Piccard, in full Jacques-Ernest-Jean Piccard,  (born July 28, 1922, Brussels, Belgium—died November 1, 2008, La Tour-de-Peilz, Switzerland), Swiss oceanic engineer, economist, and physicist, who helped his father, Auguste Piccard, build the bathyscaphe for deep-sea exploration and who also invented the mesoscaphe, an undersea vessel for exploring middle depths.
He was born in Brussels while his Swiss-born father was a professor at the University of Brussels. After graduating from the École Nouvelle de Suisse Romande in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1943, he studied at the University of Geneva, taking a year off in 1944–45 in order to serve with the French First Army. Upon receiving his licentiate in 1946, he taught at the university for two years before entering private teaching.
Meanwhile, he was helping his father to design bathyscaphes and in 1953 accompanied him in the Trieste on a dive of 3,099 metres (10,168 feet) off the island of Ponza, Italy. In 1956 Jacques Piccard went to the United States seeking funding; two years later the U.S. Navy bought the Trieste and retained him as a consultant. On January 23, 1960, he and Lieutenant Don Walsh of the U.S. Navy set a new submarine depth record by descending 10,916 metres (35,814 feet) into the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean using the Trieste. He recounted this feat in Seven Miles Down (1961), written with Robert Dietz. In the early 1960s, working with his father, he designed and built the first of four mesoscaphes. His first mesoscaphe, the Auguste Piccard, capable of carrying 40 passengers, transported some 33,000 tourists through the depths of Lake Geneva during the 1964 Swiss National Exhibition in Lausanne. In 1969 he drifted some 3,000 km (1,800 miles) along the east coast of North America in the mesoscaphe Ben Franklin, conducting research on the Gulf Stream for the U.S. Navy.
In his later career Piccard was a consultant scientist for several private American organizations for deep-sea research, including the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, New York (1966–71). In the 1970s he founded the Foundation for the Study and Protection of Seas and Lakes, based in Cully, Switzerland. In 1999 his son Bertrand Piccard, together with Englishman Brian Jones, completed the first nonstop circumnavigation of the globe in a balloon.
