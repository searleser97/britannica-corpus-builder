Great Republic,   American clipper ship designed and built by Donald McKay. At about 4,555 registered tons and a length of 325 feet (99 m), it was the largest clipper ship afloat and also one of the fastest. It was originally towed from its shipyard in East Boston to New York City in preparation for its maiden voyage, but there, at Christmas 1853, a disastrous fire consumed its fourth deck. The ship was then bought by Captain Nathaniel B. Palmer, repaired, and rigged in a style more conservative than McKay’s original plan. Its best day’s run was 413 miles (665 km).
