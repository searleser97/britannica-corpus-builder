Volante,   Spanish one- or two-passenger carriage, having two wheels and an open, hooded body. The body was set in front of the wheels and attached to the long shafts. The carriage was usually pulled by one horse, which was ridden by the coachman, although two or three horses were also used. Volantes were popular in Spain, Cuba, Mexico, and Louisiana. From about 1830 to 1870, great numbers were manufactured in New York City.
