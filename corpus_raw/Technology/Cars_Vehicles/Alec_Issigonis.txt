Sir Alec Issigonis, in full Sir Alexander Arnold Constantine Issigonis,  (born Nov. 18, 1906, Smyrna [now İzmir], Tur.—died  Oct. 2, 1988, Birmingham, Eng.), British automobile designer who created the best-selling, economical Mini and the perennially popular Morris Minor.
The son of a Greek merchant, Issigonis immigrated to London in 1922 during the war between Greece and Turkey. After studying engineering, he joined Morris Motors in 1936 as a suspension designer. There he developed the Morris Minor, which remained in production from 1948 to 1971. A reliable car with excellent steering and cornering qualities, it was the first all-British car to pass the one million mark in sales; surviving models are still cherished by owners and collectors.
After briefly working elsewhere in the early 1950s, Issigonis returned to what had become the British Motor Corp., where in 1959, in response to the Suez energy crisis (1956) and the popularity of Germany’s Volkswagen Beetle, he introduced the Mini. The boxy, inexpensive, fuel-efficient Mini used a transverse engine to power its front wheels—a radical design at the time—and thus could comfortably seat four passengers despite being only 10 feet (3 m) long. Its practicality and affordability made it immediately popular; by the time of Issigonis’ death more than five million had been sold.
Issigonis became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1967 and was knighted in 1969.
