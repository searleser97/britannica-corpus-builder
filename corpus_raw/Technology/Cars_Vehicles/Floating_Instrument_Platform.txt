Floating Instrument Platform (FLIP),  oceanographic study platform developed in the United States. It combines the advantages of extreme stability while floating on site and ease of movement to new areas. In the horizontal position, FLIP, 109 m (357 feet) long, can be towed behind a ship. When FLIPâ€™s ballast tanks are flooded, the platform tilts to an upright position with 17 m (55 feet) of its length above water. Above-water equipment includes cranes for lowering measurement instruments into the water, laboratories, radio equipment, and living quarters for the crew.
