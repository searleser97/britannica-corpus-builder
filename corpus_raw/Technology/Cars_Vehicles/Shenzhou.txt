Shenzhou, (Chinese: “Divine Craft”)  any of a series of Chinese spacecraft, the fifth flight of which carried the first Chinese astronaut into space.
Shenzhou is similar in design to the Russian Soyuz spacecraft. Like Soyuz, Shenzhou consists of three modules: a cylindrical rear module that contains instrumentation and the propulsion system, a bell-shaped middle module that carries the crew during launch and landing, and a cylindrical forward orbital module that carries scientific and military experiments. (Unlike the Soyuz, the orbital module is capable of independent flight; on several Shenzhou missions, the orbital module remained in orbit for several months after its separation from the reentry module.) Shenzhou is 9.3 metres (30.5 feet) long and weighs 7,840 kg (17,280 pounds). The launch vehicle is a Chang Zheng 2F (CZ-2F, or Long March 2F), a version of the CZ-2 specifically developed for the Shenzhou program.
The first four Shenzhou missions were uncrewed test flights launched over a three-year period (1999–2002). On October 15, 2003, Shenzhou 5 carried the first Chinese astronaut, pilot Yang Liwei, on a 21-hour spaceflight. China thus became the third country after Russia and the United States to launch a crewed spacecraft. Shenzhou 6 was launched on October 12, 2005, lasted five days, and carried two astronauts. Shenzhou 7 was launched on September 25, 2008, and carried three astronauts; one of them, commander Zhai Zhigang, made the first Chinese space walk.
China launched the Tiangong 1 space station on September 29, 2011, and the uncrewed Shenzhou 8 automatically docked with Tiangong 1 on November 3, 2011. The first crewed mission to Tiangong 1, Shenzhou 9, launched on June 16, 2012, and carried China’s first woman astronaut, Liu Yang. Shenzhou 8 and 9 were, respectively, China’s first uncrewed and crewed space docking. Shenzhou 10, launched on June 11, 2013, carried three astronauts to Tiangong 1 for a two-week mission. The next Chinese space station, Tiangong 2, was visited only by Shenzhou 11 in late 2016. Two astronauts spent more than 32 days in orbit.
Construction began on a larger three-module Tiangong station with the launch of the Tianhe core module in April 2021. The first flight to the station, Shenzhou 12, carried three astronauts and docked with Tianhe in June 2021.
In 2020 China tested a partially reusable spacecraft that could be Shenzhou’s successor. The new spacecraft could carry up to six astronauts into orbit.
