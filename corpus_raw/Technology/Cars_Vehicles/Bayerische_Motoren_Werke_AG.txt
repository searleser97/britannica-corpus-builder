BMW, in full Bayerische Motoren Werke AG,  German automaker noted for quality sports sedans and motorcycles. Headquarters are in Munich.
It originated in 1916 as Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke, a builder of aircraft engines, but assumed the name Bayerische Motoren Werke in July 1917 and began producing motorcycles in the 1920s. BMW entered the automobile business in 1928. The company’s R32 motorcycle set a world speed record that was not broken until 1937. During World War II BMW built the world’s first jet airplane engines, used by the Luftwaffe, Germany’s air force. After the war the company tried to move into the small-car market but found that it could not compete effectively against Volkswagen’s compact, inexpensive autos. By 1959 the company was on the verge of bankruptcy, and its managers were planning to sell the firm to Daimler-Benz.
In that year, however, BMW pulled out of its financial slump; German entrepreneur Herbert Quandt acquired a controlling interest in the firm, and BMW introduced its 700 series, soon followed by the equally successful 1500 model. At about the same time, the company introduced a new series of motorcycles that were particularly popular in the United States.
BMW was firmly established as a premium automobile brand by the end of the 20th century. In a failed attempt to gain market share as a sport-utility vehicle company, BMW purchased the Rover Group in 1994 but lost roughly $4 billion before selling the Land Rover brand to Ford in 2000. BMW saw great success with the relaunch of the British MINI in 2001, however, and another British brand, Rolls-Royce, became part of BMW in 2003. Members of the Quandt family continued to hold a significant stake in the company.
