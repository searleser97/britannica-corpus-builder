F-86, also called Sabre,  U.S. single-seat, single-engine jet fighter built by North American Aviation, Inc., the first jet fighter in the West to exploit aerodynamic principles learned from German engineering at the close of World War II. The F-86 was built with the wings swept back in order to reduce transonic drag rise as flight speed approached the sound barrier, and it was capable of exceeding the speed of sound in a dive. A prototype was first flown in October 1947, and the first squadron became operational in 1949. In December 1950, U.S. pilots flying F-86s began historyâ€™s first large-scale jet fighter combat against Soviet-built MiG-15s in Korea. Though inferior to the MiG-15 in weight of armament, turn radius, and maximum speed at combat altitude, the F-86 quickly established supremacy over its Soviet adversary, in part because of its superior handling characteristics. In September 1958, Sabres flown by Chinese Nationalists (also against MiG-15s) became the first jets to fire guided air-to-air missiles in combat. The last one built was delivered to the U.S. Air Force in December 1956.
The F-86 had a wingspan of 37 feet 1 inch (11.3 m) and a length of 37 feet 6 inches (11.45 m). Powered by a series of General Electric turbojet engines generating 5,000 to 9,000 pounds (22 to 40 kilonewtons) of thrust, it had a top speed of almost 700 miles (1,100 km) per hour in level flight and a maximum service altitude approaching 50,000 feet (15,000 m). Besides missiles, its armament included .50-inch machine guns or 20-millimetre cannon in the fuselage and rockets or bombs under the wings.
