Clarence, also called Growler,  a horse-drawn, four-wheeled coupé that was named in honour of the Duke of Clarence and first introduced in 1840 in London. The body held two seats facing one another and could transport four people in comfort. The carriage was suspended most often on large elliptic springs between two sets of equally sized wheels. It was an especially large style of coupé, with a separate outside seat for the driver and an extended front window, usually curved.
