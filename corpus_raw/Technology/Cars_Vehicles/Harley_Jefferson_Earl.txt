Harley Jefferson Earl,  (born November 22, 1893, Hollywood, California, U.S.—died April 10, 1969, West Palm Beach, Florida), industrial designer best known as the leading automotive stylist in the 20th-century United States.
Earl studied at Stanford University but left school to work with his father in the Earl Automotive Works, a custom shop catering to Hollywood clients such as film director Cecil B. DeMille, comedian Roscoe (“Fatty”) Arbuckle, and cowboy actor Tom Mix. When this shop was sold in 1927, Earl secured a job as head of a new design division at General Motors.
In 1937 Earl renamed what had been the Art and Color Section the Style Section. He established industry standards for design techniques and methods that were still used in the early 21st century, including integrated design—a process whereby all aspects of a product, from design to pricing, are addressed by a united team—and annual updates to each model of automobile. He also pioneered in the hiring of women designers.
Earl is perhaps best known as the major design force behind the creation of the classic Corvette and Firebird concept cars. He also put the fins on Cadillacs in the era following World War II, styling the twin curvilinear taillights of the 1948 Cadillac after the twin-boomed tail of the P-38 Lightning, a fighter plane designed by Kelly Johnson.
The official trophy for the winning driver of the NASCAR Daytona 500 is the Harley J. Earl Perpetual Trophy, so named to honour Earl’s contributions to automotive design.
