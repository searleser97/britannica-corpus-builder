Maxie Anderson, byname of Max Leroy Anderson,  (born Sept. 10, 1934, Sayre, Okla., U.S.—died  June 27, 1983, near Bad Brückenau, W.Ger.), balloonist who, with Ben Abruzzo and Larry Newman, made the first transatlantic balloon flight and, with his son Kristian, made the first nonstop trans-North American balloon flight.
Anderson entered the Missouri Military Academy, Mexico, Mo., at the age of eight and throughout his schooling worked summers with his father, a pipeline builder. Anderson held a pilot’s license at the age of 15, having lied about his age. By the age of 29 he owned his own mining company in Albuquerque, N.M. He began flying hot-air balloons in New Mexico, alone and with his friend Ben Abruzzo, who was also a light-aircraft flyer (planes, gliders, and helicopters). In 1977 they decided to attempt the transatlantic flight in honour of the 50th anniversary of Charles Lindbergh’s flight to Le Bourget field near Paris. Ed Yost, balloonist and balloon builder, whose transatlantic flight had failed in 1958, built the Double Eagle, a helium balloon, for them and trained them to fly it. They launched the balloon near Marshfield, Mass., on Sept. 9, 1977, but had to set down off the coast of Iceland on September 13. In 1978 a third crew member was added, Larry Newman, head of the Electra Flyer Corporation, a maker of hang gliders, who applied his expertise to the building of the Double Eagle II. On August 11 it was launched from Presque Isle, Maine, and landed near Miserey, France, on August 17.
On May 8, 1980, Anderson and his son Kristian launched the helium balloon Kitty Hawk from Fort Baker, Calif., and landed, on May 12, at Sainte-Félicité, Que., Can., the first trans-North American nonstop balloon flight.
Anderson was killed in an accident during a balloon race.
