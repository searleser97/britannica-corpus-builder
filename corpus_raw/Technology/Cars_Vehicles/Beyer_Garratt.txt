Beyer-Garratt,   type of steam locomotive characterized by tremendous hauling capacity and light axle loads. This British-built locomotive had two articulated pivoting chassis, each with its own wheels, cylinders, and water tanks. These chassis supported a girder frame that carried a boiler, cab, and the fuel supply. The Beyer-Garratt was particularly well-suited for rail lines of narrow gauge with lightly laid tracks because the weight of the locomotive was spread over a considerable distance. In addition, the articulated design of the earlier models, as well as the most powerful, the 1956 model locomotive with its 4-8-2+2-8-4 axle arrangement, enabled it to operate safely on lines with sharp curves. In such an axle arrangement, each chassis is equipped with 4 pilot wheels and 8 driving wheels and an additional 2 wheels under each end of the boiler between the driving mechanisms of the two chassis.
The Beyer-Garratt locomotive was developed by the British engineer Herbert Garratt during the early 1900s. It was named for him and the firm of Beyer, Peacock and Company, which acquired rights to the patent. The locomotive was used throughout the world except North America from the 1920s to the late 1950s. By the late 20th century it continued to be used only in southern Asia and southern Africa and, even there, was being replaced by diesel and electric locomotives.
