Gauge, also called Railway Gauge,  in railroad transportation, the width between the inside faces of running rails. Because the cost of construction and operation of a rail line is greater or less depending on the gauge, much controversy has surrounded decisions in respect to it, and a proliferation of gauges has developed throughout the world. A narrow gauge has, in addition to cost advantages, a capability for sharper curvature; among its disadvantages are reduced lateral stability and consequent loss of operating speed.
About three-fifths of the rail trackage in the world is the so-called standard gauge of 4 feet 8.5 inches (1.4 m), which originated with George Stephenson’s pioneer Liverpool & Manchester line in 1829. It was exported from Britain to Europe and the United States with the export of British locomotives built to it. Among notable deviations are Russia’s 5-foot (1.5-metre) gauge, Spain’s 5-foot 6-inch (1.7-metre) gauge, and Japan’s 3-foot 6-inch (1.1-metre) gauge. Several countries operate railroads on two different gauges; Pakistan operates on three; and Australia and India use four.
