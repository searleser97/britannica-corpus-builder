Charlotte Dundas,  first practical steamboat, designed by the Scottish engineer William Symington, and built for towing on the Forth and Clyde Canal. She proved herself in a test in March 1802 by pulling two 70-ton barges 19 1/2 miles (31 kilometres) in six hours. The tug, 56 feet (17 metres) long by 18 feet (5 metres) wide was powered by a 10-horsepower adaptation of the Watt engine linked to a paddle wheel in a stern well. She failed to gain a commission to replace horse towing after fears were expressed that eddies from her wheel would damage canal banks.
