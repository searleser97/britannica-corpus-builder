Gowin Knight,  (baptized Sept. 10, 1713, Corringham, Lincolnshire, Eng.â€”died June 8, 1772, London), English scientist and inventor whose work in the field of magnetization led to significant improvements in the magnetic compass.
In 1744 Knight exhibited powerful bar magnets before the Royal Society of London, proving that he had discovered a greatly improved method of magnetizing steel. Knight then turned his attention to the compasses used by mariners. He found the needles to be crudely magnetized and inaccurate and suggested the now common rhomboidal shape and an improved suspension. After experimentation by the Royal Navy, his new compass became standard and remained so for almost a century.
