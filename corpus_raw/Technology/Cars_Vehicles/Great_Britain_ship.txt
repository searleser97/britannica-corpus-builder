It was the worldâ€™s largest ship at the time of its launching (1843) and was 322 feet (98 m) long with a tonnage of 3,270. Designed by the British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel originally as a paddle steamer and built at Bristol, it was equipped with screw machinery that was supplemented by sails on six (later five) masts. In 1884 it was damaged when rounding Cape Horn and was sold as a hulk at Port Stanley, Falkland Islands, where it was scuttled in 1937. It was later raised, restored, and put on display at Bristol, Eng.
