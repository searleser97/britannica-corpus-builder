Proton,  Russian launch vehicle used for both government and commercial payloads. Since 1965 the Proton launch vehicle has been a workhorse means of access to space, first for the Soviet Union and now Russia. Proton has been used to launch spacecraft to Venus and Mars; elements of the space stations Salyut, Mir, and International Space Station; and satellites into low and geostationary Earth orbits.
Proton was originally designated the UR-500; it was designed as an intercontinental ballistic missile for the most powerful Soviet thermonuclear weapons by the design bureau headed by Vladimir Chelomey. Its purpose was changed during development, and since its first launch (of the Proton-1 satellite) in July 1965 it has been used only as a space launch vehicle. The name of the launcher was changed to Proton after its initial launch. The launcher has been produced in two-, three-, and four-stage versions and has undergone continuous improvements since it entered service. Its first three stages are fueled by a combination of nitrous oxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) liquid fuels. Earlier versions of the fourth stage were fueled by a combination of liquid oxygen and kerosene, but the current fourth stage uses the nitrous tetroxide–UDMH combination.
Launchpads for the Proton are located at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Proton reliability has been greater than 90 percent over its many years of service. The prime contractor for the vehicle is now the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Centre, located near Moscow. Commercial launches on Proton are marketed globally by International Launch Services—a joint venture of Khrunichev and the Russian firm RSC Energia.
