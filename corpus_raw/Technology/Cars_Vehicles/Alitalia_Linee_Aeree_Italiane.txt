Alitalia–Linee Aeree Italiane,  Italian international airline founded in 1946 and, by the early 21st century, serving more than 80 cities in Europe, Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Australia. Headquarters are in Rome. The pope usually flies on a chartered Alitalia jet nicknamed “Shepherd One.”
The company was established in 1946 as Alitalia–Aerolinee Italiane Internazionali and flew its first route, from Turin to Rome, in 1947. In 1957 it merged with another Italian airline, LAI, or Linee Aeree Italiane, and the current name was adopted. In succeeding decades, Alitalia’s holdings tended to become conglomerate, with the acquisition or establishment of catering companies, hotel chains, resorts, a property management company, insurance and reinsurance companies, a data-processing company, and Alitalia International Holding SA (in Luxembourg), which is engaged in acquiring holdings in foreign firms. In 1997 Alitalia created a regional subsidiary called Alitalia Express, and in 2004 it acquired the bankrupt regional carrier Gandalf Airlines.
Despite large investments by the Italian government and other organizations, Alitalia continued to lose money from 1998 onward because of labour problems, increasing fuel prices, and other difficulties. After a series of unsuccessful attempts by the Italian government to merge the company with another European airline or to sell it outright, Alitalia filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008. In December of that year the Italian government sold Alitalia to the Italian investment group Compagnia Aerea Italiana (CAI; Italian Air Company), which also purchased Alitalia’s rival, Air One, with the intent of merging the two carriers. In January 2009 Alitalia agreed to sell a quarter of its capital to Air France–KLM, pending the approval of its owners and European Union (EU) competition authorities.
