Queen Elizabeth,  any one of three ships belonging to the British Cunard Line that successfully crossed over from the age of the transatlantic ocean liner to the age of the global cruise ship.
The first Queen Elizabeth was one of the largest passenger liners ever built. Launched in 1938 and used as a troopship during World War II, it entered the regular transatlantic service of the Cunard Line in 1946. The ship was 1,031 feet (314 metres) long and 118.5 feet (36 metres) wide and had a draft of 38 feet (11.6 metres) and an original gross tonnage of 83,673. The Queen Elizabeth was retired in 1968 and sold for conversion to a seagoing university, but it burned and sank in January 1972 during refitting at Hong Kong.
Its successor, the Queen Elizabeth 2 (QE2), was launched in 1967 and made its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York in 1969. The ship, 963 feet (294 metres) long and displacing 70,327 tons, was slightly smaller than its predecessor so that it could pass through the Panama Canal and operate as a cruise ship in addition to being a transatlantic liner. Its steam turbine engines gave it a top speed of 32.5 knots (though its service speed was 28.5 knots). In 1982 the QE2 was briefly requisitioned as a troop carrier in the Falkland Islands War. In 1986–87 the turbines were replaced with diesel engines. The QE2 made its final voyage between New York and England in 2008, after having become the longest-serving ship in Cunard’s history. Later that year the ship sailed to Dubai, where it was handed over to new owners for refitting as a floating hotel.
Cunard took delivery of a new Queen Elizabeth in 2010. Known variously as the QE and the QE3, that cruise ship was approximately the same length as the QE2 but with a slightly greater displacement, of more than 90,000 tons. Designed in  Art Deco style to evoke memories of its predecessors and the great passenger liners of the pre-World War II era, the luxury ship could accommodate 2,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members on cruises to the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and other destinations around the world.
