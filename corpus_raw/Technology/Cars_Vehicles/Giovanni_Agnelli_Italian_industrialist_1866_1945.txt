Giovanni Agnelli,  (born Aug. 13, 1866, Villar Perosa, Piedmont, Italy—died  Dec. 16, 1945, Turin), founder of the Fiat (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino) automobile company and the leading Italian industrialist of the first half of the 20th century.
Agnelli attended the military school at Modena, but he quit the army in 1892. In 1899 he was one of the prime movers in creating Fiat, which soon became an internationally renowned automobile manufacturer. During World War I, Fiat ran its huge Turin plants at full speed, supplying the Italian military forces with armaments. The company employed a workforce of more than 30,000 in the production of streetcars, airplanes, railroad cars, tractors, and diesel engines.
In 1921 workers seized the Fiat plants and hoisted the red flag of communism over them. Agnelli responded by quitting the company, retiring to private life, and letting the workers try to run Fiat. In short order, 3,000 of them paraded to his office and asked him to return to the helm—a request to which he acquiesced. A supporter of Benito Mussolini, he was named to the Senate by the Fascist dictator in 1923. Agnelli also established the ball- and roller-bearing industry in Italy (1907), and he was a chief mobilizer of the Italian war industry before and during World War II. In April 1945, however, the Italian Committee of National Liberation removed him—along with other top executives—from control of Fiat. Control did not return to the Agnelli family until 1966.
