Freeboard,   distance from the waterline to the freeboard deck of a fully loaded ship; it is measured amidships at the side of the hull. The freeboard deck is the deck below which all bulkheads are made watertight; above it that precaution is not necessary. Freeboard represents the safety margin showing to what depths a ship may be loaded under various service conditionsâ€”e.g., the type of cargo, the waters to be navigated, and the season of the year. Freeboard is determined by the design of the vessel, particularly the shape and dimensions of its watertight hull; by its structural strength; and, in the case of a passenger ship, by the subdivision of its watertight compartments. Definite freeboard rules, based on the provision of adequate reserve buoyancy, were first established in the second half of the 19th century, largely through the efforts of Samuel Plimsoll, a British politician and social reformer. See also Plimsoll line.
