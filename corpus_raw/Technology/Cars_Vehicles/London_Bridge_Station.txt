London Bridge Station,  railway station in the Bermondsey district of Southwark, London. It lies southeast of London Bridge and northeast of Guyâ€™s Hospital, and it is adjacent to the tourist attraction called the London Dungeon.
The first station on the site was built of wood in 1836, but more permanent construction followed in the 1840s. In 1849 it was remodeled into two sections to serve the South Eastern and the Greenwich railways. Major repairs were made to the station following World War II. It is linked with the stations of Cannon Street and Blackfriars in the City of London, Charing Cross Station in Westminster, and districts to the south and east of London.
