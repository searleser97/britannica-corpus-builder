Genesis,  U.S. spacecraft that returned particles of the solar wind to Earth in 2004. Genesis was launched on Aug. 8, 2001. The spacecraft spent 884 days orbiting the first Lagrangian point, 1.5 million km (930,000 miles) from Earth, and capturing 10–20 micrograms of solar wind particles on ultrapure collector arrays. The intent was to determine directly the composition of the Sun in order to provide more certain results than those obtained by means of spectral data from telescopic observations. In addition, the collected particles were expected to provide clues to the composition of the original nebula that formed the solar system.
However, the mission ended as a near-total failure when the Genesis spacecraft crashed into the Utah desert on Sept. 8, 2004. Genesis was to have been recovered by helicopter as it parachuted to Earth. The parachutes did not deploy, apparently because, as investigations later suggested, drawings for the craft’s gravity sensors were reversed. Despite damage to the sample capsule, the Genesis science team was able to salvage some specimens.
