Zond,  any of a series of eight unmanned Soviet lunar and interplanetary probes. Zond 1 (launched April 2, 1964) and Zond 2 (launched Nov. 30, 1964) were aimed at Venus and Mars, respectively, but failed to send back data on the planets. Zond 3 (launched July 18, 1965) transmitted close-up photographs of 3,000,000 square miles (7,800,000 square km) of the lunar surface, including the hidden side, before going into solar orbit. The remaining flights in the Zond program were tests of Soyuz spacecraft modified for flights around the Moon. Zond 4 (launched March 2, 1968) was placed into an orbit away from the Moon that carried it 330,000 km (205,000 miles) from Earth. When a landing in the Soviet Union became impossible, Zond 4 was ordered to explode in Earth’s atmosphere. Zond 5 (launched Sept. 14, 1968) became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon and return to a splashdown on the Earth, and it carried living specimens. Zonds 6, 7, and 8 (launched Nov. 10, 1968, Aug. 7, 1969, and Oct. 20, 1970, respectively) also made circumlunar flights; they too carried biological specimens and transmitted photography of the Moon’s surface.
