Paul W. Litchfield, in full Paul Weeks Litchfield,  (born July 26, 1875, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died March 18, 1959, Phoenix, Arizona), American industrialist who was president (1926–40) and chairman of the board (1930–58) of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, a firm that he helped develop into a worldwide operation.
Litchfield graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1896 in chemical engineering. His first job in the rubber industry was with a bicycle-tire manufacturer. In 1900 he became superintendent at the Akron plant of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and thereafter ascended rapidly, becoming president in 1926 and chairman of the board four years later.
At Goodyear Litchfield established a research and development department that produced the first practical airplane tire, long-haul conveyor belts, hydraulic disc brakes for airplanes, the first pneumatic truck tire, and a bullet-sealing fuel tank for military airplanes. Goodyear built a research centre in 1943 for almost $1.5 million to centralize the work of 250 research scientists.
Litchfield expanded Goodyear’s foreign operations, setting up plants, factories, and plantations in Java, Sumatra, the Philippines, and Mexico, as well as in South America, Europe, and Africa. An advocate of flying, Litchfield began an aeronautics department for Goodyear in 1910 and launched the company into lighter-than-air craft production. It produced observation balloons, zeppelins, and dirigibles, many of which set size and altitude records. During World War II the company had 37,000 workers producing aircraft and airplane parts, making it one of the 10 largest such producers in the country.
Litchfield authored books on air power, trucks, employee relations, and business. His autobiography, Industrial Voyage, was published in 1954.
