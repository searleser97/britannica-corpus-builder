Marcel Dassault, original name Marcel Bloch,  (born Jan. 22, 1892, Paris, France—died  April 18, 1986, Paris), French aircraft designer and industrialist whose companies built the most successful military aircraft in Europe in the decades after World War II.
The son of a Jewish physician, Bloch obtained degrees in aeronautical design and electrical engineering and worked as an aircraft designer for France during World War I. He engaged in real estate in the 1920s but returned to aeronautics in 1930, starting his own company and building military and civilian airplanes with notable success and profitability. During World War II he refused to work for the Germans and was eventually sent to Buchenwald concentration camp.
After the war Bloch changed his last name to Dassault (a nom de guerre of one of his brothers in the Resistance) and converted to Roman Catholicism. His aircraft-manufacturing company, Générale Aéronautique Marcel Dassault, led the postwar revival of the French aircraft industry, producing Europe’s first supersonic plane, the Mystère, as well as the highly successful line of delta-winged military aircraft called Mirages (from 1956). The various Mirage warplanes proved very popular among neutral and Third World nations and became some of the most widely used military aircraft in the world. In 1967 Dassault’s company merged with Breguet Aviation, a manufacturer of transport aircraft, to form Avions Marcel Dassault–Breguet Aviation.
Dassault was a deputy in the National Assembly from 1951 to 1955 and from 1958 until his death.
