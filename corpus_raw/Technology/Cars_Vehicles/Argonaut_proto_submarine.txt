Argonaut,   first submarine to navigate extensively in the open sea, built in 1897 by the American engineer and naval architect Simon Lake. Designed to send out divers rather than to sink ships, the Argonaut was fitted with wheels for travel on the bottom of the sea and had an airtight chamber with a hatch that could be opened to the sea when the air pressure of the chamber and of the water outside were made equal. In 1898 the Argonaut traveled from Norfolk, Va., to New York through heavy storms, proving the seaworthiness of this type of submarine construction.
