Airframe,   basic structure of an airplane or spacecraft excluding its power plant and instrumentation; its principal components thus include the wings, fuselage, tail assembly, and landing gear. The airframe is designed to withstand all aerodynamic forces as well as the stresses imposed by the weight of the fuel, crew, and payload.
Most airframes of early airplanes consisted of a fuselage of truss design constructed of narrow hardwood boards or steel tubing and braced with wires. This basic framework supported the wing structure, which was composed of spars with ribbing. Both the fuselage and wings were covered by a skin of cotton fabric. Airframe construction was radically improved during the 1930s. The aerodynamically contoured fuselage shell characteristic of all modern aircraft was introduced at this time, and high-strength, lightweight metals (chiefly aluminum alloys, magnesium, and some stainless steel and titanium) replaced wood and fabric throughout the airframe.
