Boatswain, also called bosun,  ship’s officer responsible for maintenance of the ship and its equipment.
Before the Royal Navy was established, the term boatswain was applied to the expert seaman on an English merchant vessel. Each ship had a master, who was proficient in navigation, and a boatswain, who was second in command. The boatswain was responsible for the masts, yards, sails, rigging, anchors, boats, and cordage. The distinctive boatswain’s pipe or whistle was used to issue signals to the crew, and the boatswain typically was assisted by boatswain’s mates.
When the British crown hired a ship, two warrants were issued: one to the ship’s owner and another for the services of the boatswain, thus originating the term warrant officer. From the beginnings of both the Royal Navy and the U.S. Navy boatswains have been warrant officers. In modern vessels the boatswain has charge of anchors and anchor gear, cargo-handling gear, rigging, boats, and instruction of the crew in practical seamanship.
