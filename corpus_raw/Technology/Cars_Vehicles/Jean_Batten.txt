Jean Batten, byname of Jane Gardner Batten,  (born 1909, Rotorua, New Zealand—died November 22, 1982, Majorca, Spain), aviator who made record-breaking flights from 1933 to 1937 and was perhaps the most famous New Zealander of the 1930s.
Batten was sent by her parents to England to study music, but she became intensely interested in flying and earned a private pilot’s license in 1930. She gained a commercial pilot’s license in 1932. In May 1934 she set a women’s record in her solo flight from England to Australia in 14 days, 23 hours, and 25 minutes. In April 1935 she became the first woman to fly solo from Australia to England, and in November 1935 she became the first woman to make a solo flight from England to Argentina. In October 1936 she made the first direct solo flight from England to New Zealand, in the process setting a record time for solo flight from England to Australia. She made other record times in solo flights from Australia to England (October 1937) and from England to Brazil. By the late 1930s she had received many honours and was an international celebrity, but she subsequently stopped flying and became somewhat reclusive. Her autobiography was entitled My Life (1938).
