Energia,  Soviet heavy-lift launch vehicle. In 1976 approval was given for development of Energia (named for the design bureau that developed it) and its primary mission, the space shuttle Buran. Energia could lift 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit, slightly more than the American launch vehicle Saturn V. Takeoff thrust was 29,000 kilonewtons (6,600,000 pounds). The Energia was 60 metres (197 feet) high. Its spacecraft payload was attached to the side of its core stage, not placed on top as with almost all other launch vehicles.
Energiaâ€™s first launch was in 1987 and had Polyus, an experimental military space platform, as its payload. In 1988 its second and final launch carried Buran to orbit on its only mission, without a crew aboard. Energia was deemed too expensive for the Soviet Union to continue to operate, and no other uses for the vehicle emerged.
