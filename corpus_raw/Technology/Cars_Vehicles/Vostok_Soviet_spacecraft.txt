Vostok,  any of a series of manned Soviet spacecraft, the initial flight of which carried the first human being into space. Launched on April 12, 1961, Vostok 1, carrying cosmonaut Yury A. Gagarin, made a single orbit of Earth before reentry. The Vostok series included six launchings over a two-year period (1961â€“63). While the first flight lasted only 1 hour and 48 minutes, the second, Vostok 2 (Aug. 6, 1961), remained in space more than 25 hours, making 17 orbits around the Earth. The remaining Vostok missions were launched in pairs. Vostok 3 and Vostok 4 were both launched on Aug. 11, 1962, and orbited in sight of each other. Vostok 3 set a new time record in space of 94 hours and traveled more than 1,600,000 miles (2,560,000 km) in Earth orbit.
The final two missions in the Vostok series included the participation of the first woman cosmonaut. Vostok 5 lifted off on June 14, 1963, followed two days later by Vostok 6 carrying Valentina V. Tereshkova. These Vostok flights were notable in that the two spacecraft traveled so close together (at times only 3 miles [4.8 km] apart), setting the stage for future space dockings between orbiting vehicles.
A chronology of spaceflights in the Vostok program is shown in the table.
