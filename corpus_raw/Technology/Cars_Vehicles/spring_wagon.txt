Spring wagon,  four-wheeled vehicle drawn by draft animals (most often horses), having a square box and between two and four movable seat boards. It was a general-purpose wagon used for the transportation of either goods or passengers, and in 19th century America it enjoyed wide popularity with farmers.
The spring wagon also featured a spring-loaded rear gate to facilitate the loading of goods and was sometimes equipped with a canopy. Since the box body was hung on platform springs—either front, rear, or both—it was sometimes referred to as a platform wagon or platform spring wagon. It was used much as the pickup truck or delivery van is used in modern times.
