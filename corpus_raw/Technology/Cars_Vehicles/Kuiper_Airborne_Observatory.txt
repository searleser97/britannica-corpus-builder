Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO),  a Lockheed C-141 jet transport aircraft specially instrumented for astronomical observations at high altitudes. Named for the American astronomer Gerard P. Kuiper, it was operated (1971–95) by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
The observatory, equipped with a 0.9-metre (36-inch) Cassegrain reflecting telescope, was typically flown at an altitude of 12,500 metres (41,000 feet) to measure infrared radiation emitted by planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. Much of the infrared radiation in certain spectral regions is absorbed by water vapour and carbon dioxide in Earth’s lower atmosphere and so cannot be detected by ground-based telescopes. The major discoveries of the KAO include the rings of the planet Uranus, stars in the process of formation, and molecules in interstellar space and in planetary atmospheres. A more sophisticated airborne observatory, a modified Boeing 747 named the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), developed by the United States and Germany, began observations in 2010.
