Wagonette,   horse-drawn carriage designed to carry a large number of passengers who sat on long bench-style seats facing each other. The driverâ€™s seat was separate and mounted from the front, while passengers boarded the vehicle from a door in the rear. The first wagonette was built in England about 1843 and became a popular vehicle, partially because of the implied endorsement of Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria. It was eventually made in a great variety of styles and sizes for public and private use, and it remained popular well into the 20th century.
