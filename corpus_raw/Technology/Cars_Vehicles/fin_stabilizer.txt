Fin stabilizer,   fin or small wing mounted on a ship or aircraft in such a way as to oppose unwanted rolling motions of the vehicle and thus contribute to its stability. The term also refers to the tail protuberances on bombs, artillery shells, and rockets to maintain the stability of these devices in flight. Fins are normally fixed in position but occasionally are made variable. The stabilizing fins on a ship, for example, move in such a manner as to counteract rolling caused by waves; they are usually controlled by a gyroscope.
