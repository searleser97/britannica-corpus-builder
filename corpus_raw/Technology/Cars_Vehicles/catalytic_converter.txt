Catalytic converter,  in automobiles, a component of emission control systems used to reduce the discharge of noxious and polluting gases from the internal-combustion engine. The catalytic converter consists of an insulated chamber containing a honeycomb structure or pellets coated with catalyst through which the exhaust gases are passed. Hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust are oxidized to water vapour and carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides are reduced to nitrogen and oxygen.
