Errett Lobban Cord,  (born July 20, 1894, Warrensburg, Mo., U.S.—died  Jan. 2, 1974, Reno, Nev.), U.S. automobile manufacturer, advocate of front-wheel-drive vehicles.
Previously a racing car mechanic and driver, he became president of the Auburn Automobile Company (founded 1900), Auburn, Ind., in 1924. Two years later he acquired the Duesenberg Motor Company (founded 1920), Indianapolis, Ind.; the brothers Fred and August Duesenberg designed the Model J (produced 1928–37) and other outstanding cars bearing the Duesenberg name for him. In 1929 the Auburn concern introduced the Cord L-29, the first widely sold front-wheel-drive car (produced through 1932). Subsequently, Cord built the streamlined Model 810 (1935) and Model 812 (1937).
Because of the Depression of the 1930s, manufacture of Auburns, Cords, and Duesenbergs ceased in 1937.
