Stage wagon,   early, four-wheeled, American vehicle, used to carry both passengers and cargo. It was a precursor of the stagecoach. The first stage wagons had no springs, backless wooden benches, sides of wood, and canvas tops. Later improvements were roll-up leather curtains, solid flat tops, backrests, and springs or straps for the seats. A stage wagon of 1771, whose owner called it “The Flying Machine,” was able to travel the 90-odd miles between Philadelphia and New York City in a day and a half.
In England stage wagons referred to great covered wagons, probably first used in the middle of the 16th century to carry freight and, later, passengers who could not afford stagecoach fares. Through a series of modifications the stage wagon evolved into the coach by the early 19th century.
