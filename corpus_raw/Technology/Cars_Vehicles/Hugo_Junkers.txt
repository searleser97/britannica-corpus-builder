Hugo Junkers,  (born February 3, 1859, Rheydt, Prussia [Germany]—died February 3, 1935, Gauting, near Munich, Germany), German aircraft designer and early proponent of the monoplane and all-metal construction of aircraft.
In 1895 Junkers founded the firm Junkers and Company, which made boilers, radiators, and water heaters. He patented a flying-wing design in 1910, the same year in which he established an aircraft factory at Dessau. His J-1 Blechesel (“Sheet Metal Donkey”) monoplane was the first successful all-metal airplane (1915), and his F-13 was the first all-metal transport plane (1919). Many Junkers aircraft had a corrugated sheet-metal skin, which was copied by several American builders, including the Ford Motor Company. The Junkers works also built “Jumo” aircraft engines. Under pressure from the Nazis, who sought to consolidate aircraft production under the national government and harshly criticized Junkers’s socialist leanings, he stepped down from his company in 1933.
After Junkers stepped down, the company designed one of the first turbojet engines during World War II and played an important part in German airpower during the war, supplying the Luftwaffe with the Ju 52, a trimotor monoplane used as a troop transport and glider tug; the Ju 87 dive bomber (Sturzkampfflugzeug, shortened to “Stuka”); and the Ju 88, a twin-engine all-purpose bomber.
