Scott Kelly, in full Scott Joseph Kelly,  (born February 21, 1964, Orange, New Jersey, U.S.), American astronaut who made four spaceflights, the longest of which lasted 340 days. He is the twin brother of American astronaut and senator Mark Kelly.
Scott Kelly received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York Maritime College at Throggs Neck, New York, in 1987. Scott and Mark became pilots in the U.S. Navy in 1987 and 1989, respectively. Both brothers graduated from the U.S. Navy Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Maryland, in 1994. Scott received a master’s degree in aviation systems from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in 1996.
Scott and Mark Kelly began their astronaut training in August 1996. Scott first flew into space as the pilot of the space shuttle Discovery on the STS-103 mission (December 19–27, 1999), which replaced the gyroscopes and computer on the Hubble Space Telescope. He made a subsequent flight to the International Space Station (ISS) as a mission commander. On the STS-118 mission (August 8–21, 2007) of the space shuttle Endeavour, a truss was added to the ISS.
Scott launched to the ISS on the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TMA-01M on October 8, 2010. He served as a flight engineer on Expedition 25 and became the commander of Expedition 26, which lasted from November 26, 2010, to March 16, 2011. Mark was originally scheduled to arrive at the ISS in February 2011 as commander of the space shuttle Endeavour’s last mission, STS-134, and the Kelly twins would then have become the first siblings in space at the same time. However, delays in launching an earlier mission pushed STS-134’s launch to May 16, 2011.
On March 27, 2015, Scott returned to the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-16M as part of a special mission in which he and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko spent 340 days in space, which was the longest spaceflight by an American astronaut. Scott broke the American record for most cumulative time in space, having spent 520 days in orbit on his four flights. A special part of the mission was the twins study, in which Scott was compared with the earthbound Mark to understand the medical effects of long spaceflight, such as astronauts would experience on a yearlong flight to Mars. Scott and Korniyenko returned to Earth on March 2, 2016. He retired from NASA the following month. Scott published the memoir Endurance: A Year in Space, a Lifetime of Discovery (2017).
