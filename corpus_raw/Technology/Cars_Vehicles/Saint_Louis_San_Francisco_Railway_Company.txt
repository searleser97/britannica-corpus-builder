Saint Louis-San Francisco Railway Company, byname The Frisco,  railroad with lines in nine southern and central U.S. states before it merged with Burlington Northern, Inc.
The railroad was established in 1876 as the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway, but its antecedents go back to 1849; at that time the Missouri legislature granted a charter to the Pacific Railroad to build a road to Missouriâ€™s western border, there to meet any line laid eastward from the Pacific Coast.
The St. Louis and San Francisco acquired a number of feeder lines after it was set up. Although it went bankrupt in 1916 and 1947, it did well in the decades from 1950 to 1980, serving as a bridge line between the big southern and western railroads. In 1967 it discontinued its last two passenger trains between Kansas City, Mo., and Birmingham, Ala., becoming an all-freight railroad.
When merged into the Burlington Northern in 1980, it operated about 4,500 miles (7,240 km) of track, extending from St. Louis and Kansas City southwestward to central Texas and southeastward to Mobile, Ala., and Pensacola, Fla.
