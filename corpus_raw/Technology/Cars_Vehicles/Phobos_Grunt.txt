Phobos-Grunt,  Russian spacecraft that was designed to land on the Martian moon Phobos and bring some of its soil back to Earth. It launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard a Zenit-2 launch vehicle on November 9, 2011. However, Phobos-Grunt (Russian for “Phobos soil”) did not fire its rockets to leave Earth orbit. Subsequent attempts to communicate with the spacecraft were only sporadically successful, and Phobos-Grunt was expected to reenter Earth’s atmosphere in early 2012. Phobos-Grunt was Russia’s first interplanetary spacecraft since 1996 and, had it been successful, would have been Russia’s first mission to Mars that did not end in failure.
The spacecraft would have orbited Phobos until it landed on it. After about 200 grams (7 ounces) of soil had been collected, the sample-return module would have spent four months on Phobos and then lifted off for Earth; it would have landed in Kazakhstan 11 months later.
Phobos-Grunt carried the Chinese spacecraft Yinghuo-1 (Chinese for “firefly”), China’s first spacecraft to another planet. Yinghuo-1 would have orbited Mars for one year, studying the Martian climate and environment. Phobos-Grunt contained sealed vials of microorganisms (including bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaeans) that would have returned to Earth with the Phobos soil sample, constituting an experiment sponsored by the Planetary Society, an American space advocacy group, to test if microbes can survive the journey from one planet to another.
