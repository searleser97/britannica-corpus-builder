DUKW, also called duck,  2.5-ton six-wheel amphibious truck used in World War II by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. Its primary purpose was to ferry ammunition, supplies, and equipment from supply ships in transport areas offshore to supply dumps and fighting units at the beach.
DUKW is a manufacturer’s code based on D indicating the model year, 1942; U referring to the body style, utility (amphibious); K for all-wheel drive; and W for dual rear axles. Called a “duck,” the vehicle was shaped like a boat. It had a hollow airtight body for buoyancy and used a single propeller for forward momentum. It was designed according to Army criteria and was based on the Army’s 2.5-ton truck. The vehicle was capable of carrying 25 soldiers and their equipment, an artillery piece, or 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg) of general cargo. At sea the vehicle could maintain a speed of 5 knots (about 6 statute miles, or 9 km per hour), and on land it could go 50 miles (80 km) per hour.
The United States produced 20,000 DUKWs during World War II. Through lend-lease the British were provided with 2,000 of the trucks. The vehicle was first used in Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily in 1943. In the Normandy Invasion of 1944, DUKWs were used by the infantry, engineers, rangers, artillery, and service support units. By ferrying weapons, troops, ammunition, and supplies to the beaches, they played a vital role in the overall success of the landing, though a number of vehicles sank and many lives were lost because of the high seas and the overloading of vehicles. DUKWs were also successfully employed in the Pacific by both the Marine Corps and the Army. Many of the vehicles were later sold as war surplus and used by tourism companies in waterfront cities such as London, Dublin, and Boston.
