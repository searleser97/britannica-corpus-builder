Alexander Winton,  (born June 20, 1860, Grangemouth, Stirling, Scot.—died  June 21, 1932, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.), Scottish-born American pioneer automobile manufacturer who put thousands of “Winton Sixes” on the road.
After serving an apprenticeship in Clyde shipyards Winton moved to the United States in 1880, worked in iron mills and as a steamship engineer, and became a bicycle manufacturer in Cleveland in 1890. He built a gasoline-powered car in 1896 and in 1897 formed the Winton Motor Carriage Company. In 1897, as a demonstration of endurance, he drove one of his models from Cleveland to New York City, a trip lasting from July 28 to August 7. In March 1898 he made the first sale of a regularly produced American automobile, and for some years he remained one of the leading U.S.automobile manufacturers.
Winton built four- and six-cylinder engines and was the first in the United States to build a straight eight-cylinder engine. His racing car “Bullet No. 1” set a speed record of one mile in 52.2 seconds at Daytona Beach, Fla., in 1902. In 1912 he founded the Winton Gas Engine Company, now part of General Motors, to do experimental work on diesel engines.
