National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),  organization within the United States Department of Transportation charged with reducing deaths, injuries, and property damage  from motor vehicle accidents. The NHTSA develops and implements safety standards and oversees the recall of unsafe vehicles. It provides grants to local and state governments for their highway-safety programs.
The NHTSA was created after a period of rising traffic casualties during the 1950s and ’60s, an increased public outcry about traffic accidents, and the publication of American lawyer Ralph Nader’s Unsafe at Any Speed (1965), which criticized the American auto industry for its unsafe products. Congress held a series of hearings in 1966 to determine whether a regulatory agency for traffic safety should be created. Later that year the Highway Safety Act was passed, which established the National Highway Safety Bureau (NHSB). The NHSB became the NHTSA in 1970 under the newly established Department of Transportation.
The NHTSA has a multifaceted approach to ensuring drivers’ safety. In addition to routinely recommending recalls and creating programs to educate the public, the administration publishes valuable statistics through its subdivision, the National Center for Statistics and Analysis. The administration also contains the New Car Assessment Program, which rates on a five-star scale the front, side, and rollover resistance protection of hundreds of motor vehicles by make, model, and year. The NHTSA also works with the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, the standard for the average fuel economy of American cars.
