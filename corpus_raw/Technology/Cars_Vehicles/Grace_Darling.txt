Grace Darling, in full Grace Horsley Darling,  (born Nov. 24, 1815, Bamburgh, Northumberland, Eng.â€”died Oct. 20, 1842, Bamburgh), British heroine who became famous for her participation in the rescue of shipwreck survivors.
The daughter of a lighthouse keeper, Darling grew up on Longstone in the Farne Islands. Intensely shy and private, she become the focus of national attention after the steamship Forfarshire sank during a severe storm in September 1838. Nine people managed to find refuge on nearby rocks, and Darling and her father battled rough water to row to their rescue. The incident inspired numerous poems, paintings, and songs and made Darling a virtual cult figure. After her sudden death from tuberculosis, she was buried in the Bamburgh churchyard, where an ornate monument was erected in her honour. Nearby is the Grace Darling Museum.
