Black Bart, byname of Charles E. Boles, or Bolton,  (born c. 1820, New York state, U.S.—died  1917?, New York?), California hooded robber believed to have held up some 28 stagecoaches from 1875 to 1883. Twice he left verse for the occasion, signed “Black Bart,” the more famous being: “I’ve labored long and hard for bread/ For honor and for riches/ But on my corns too long you’ve tred/ You fine haired Sons of Bitches.”
Born in New York state, he served in the American Civil War and lived in Illinois and then San Francisco (as Charles E. Bolton) for several years before taking to stage robbing late in life. Finally, in 1883, during an abortive robbery, he dropped a handkerchief, and Pinkerton agents traced him through the laundry mark. He served a little over four years in prison, was released, and then disappeared, reportedly dying in New York.
