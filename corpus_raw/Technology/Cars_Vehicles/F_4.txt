F-4, also called Phantom Ii,   two-seat, twin-engine jet fighter built by the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation (later the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation) for the United States and many other countries. The first F-4 was delivered to the U.S. Navy in 1960 and to the Air Force in 1963. By the time it went out of production in 1979, more that 5,000 Phantoms had been built, and it had become one of the most successful fighter aircraft since World War II.
In its original versions the F-4 had a wingspan of 38 feet 5 inches (11.7 m) and a length of 58 feet 3 inches (17.7 m). The wings folded for carrier stowage in the navy version. Powered by two General Electric turbojets, each generating almost 18,000 pounds (80 kilonewtons) of thrust with afterburners lit, the plane could accelerate to more than twice the speed of sound. Its operating ceiling was over 50,000 feet (15,000 m).
The first F-4s were armed only with air-to-air missiles, but, after suffering serious losses to Soviet-built MiG fighters over North Vietnam, they were fitted with 20-millimetre cannon for more effective close-range dogfighting. They also carried bombs and missiles under the wings for attacking surface targets—as they did in the Vietnam War and also in the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, when they spearheaded Israeli assaults on Egyptian and Syrian airfields and missile batteries.
In the early 1970s the F-4 was retired as a frontline fighter from the U.S. Navy and Air Force, but it continued to serve as a trainer, in radar-equipped reconnaissance versions, and as “Wild Weasel” aircraft equipped to detect and destroy radar installations and missile batteries.
