Claude-François-Dorothée, marquis de Jouffroy d’Abbans,  (born 1751, Roches-sur-Rognon, Fr.—died  1832, Paris), French engineer and inventor who in 1783 traveled upstream on the Saône River near Lyon in his Pyroscaphe, the first really successful steamboat.
At the age of 20 Jouffroy d’Abbans entered the army, and a year later he became involved in a duel that resulted in his banishment to Provence. There he began to work with boats and built a 43-foot (13-metre) steamboat with “duckfoot” paddles. Though he failed in trials on the Doubs River in 1778, five years later he succeeded with his Pyroscaphe, a vessel of 182 tons’ displacement; it was fitted with a double ratchet mechanism that produced continuous rotation of the paddle wheels. He applied for a patent, but, when the granting of this protection was indefinitely delayed, he stopped his experiments and went into exile for several years. An American inventor, Robert Fulton, meanwhile had developed a successful steamboat, and, although he gave much credit to Jouffroy d’Abbans, the latter died bitter and forgotten.
