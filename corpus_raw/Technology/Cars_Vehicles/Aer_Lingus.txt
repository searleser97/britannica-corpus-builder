Aer Lingus,  Irish international air carrier that originated as the national airline of Ireland and resulted from the combination of two government-owned companies: (1) Aer Lingus Teoranta, incorporated in 1936 and operating air services within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain and continental Europe, and (2) Aerlinte Eireann Teoranta, incorporated in 1947 and operating air services between Ireland and the United States and Canada.
The airlineâ€™s first route, inaugurated on May 27, 1936, extended from Dublin to Bristol and, in the same year, was extended to London. Other flights prior to World War II were routed to Liverpool and the Isle of Man. After the war, service was inaugurated to Paris and Amsterdam and eventually expanded to other European cities. The first transatlantic routes, from Dublin through Shannon International Airport to New York and Boston, were inaugurated in 1958; flights to Chicago and Montreal began in 1966. The Irish government privatized the airline in 2006.
