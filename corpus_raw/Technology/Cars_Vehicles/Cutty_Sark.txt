Cutty Sark,  three-masted British clipper ship, launched at Dumbarton, Dunbartonshire, Scotland, in 1869. The Cutty Sark was 212 feet 5 inches (64.7 metres) long and 36 feet (11 metres) wide, and it had a net tonnage of 921. Its name (meaning “short shirt”) came from the garment worn by the witch Nannie in Robert Burns’s poem Tam o’Shanter. On February 16, 1870, the Cutty Sark left London on its maiden voyage, sailing to Shanghai by way of the Cape of Good Hope. The vessel served in the English-Chinese tea trade through the 1870s, later in the Australian wool trade, and finally as a training ship.
In 1957, fully restored, the ship was installed in a concrete dry berth near the River Thames at Greenwich, London, and was opened to the public by Queen Elizabeth II as a maritime relic and sailing museum. In 2006 the Cutty Sark was closed for extensive renovations. The following year it was severely damaged by fire, but renovation work continued toward the goal of reopening the ship to the public in time for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London.
