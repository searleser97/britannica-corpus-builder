Waterloo Station,  railway station in the borough of Lambeth, London, England. It is one of the largest stations in the United Kingdom. Part of the station serves as a terminus for the Channel Tunnel (Eurotunnel), which connects the isle of Britain to continental Europe. The station is located in South Bank, directly east of the London Eye and the London Aquarium and northeast of Westminster Bridge.
Originally constructed in 1848, the station was rebuilt in 1853, and it was expanded over subsequent decades. The “new” Waterloo Station was opened in 1922 by Queen Mary. Its subterranean passages served as bomb shelters during World War II, although the entire structure was severely damaged. An international terminal was built at the station in the early 1990s, and high-speed rail service to France was initiated in 1994.
