Carl Ben Eielson, in full Carl Benjamin Eielson,  (born January 20?, 1897, Hatton, North Dakota, U.S.—died November 9?, 1929, off the coast of Siberia, Russia, U.S.S.R.), American aviator and explorer who was a pioneer of air travel in Alaska and the polar regions. He and Australian-British polar explorer Sir George Hubert Wilkins made the first transpolar flight across the Arctic in an airplane, as well as the first airplane flight over a portion of Antarctica, both occurring in 1928.
Eielson, who had been fascinated with flying since his childhood in North Dakota, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1917 during World War I with the intention of becoming an aviator. He was still in flight school when the war ended, but he completed his training and left the military in early 1919. He spent much of the next three years as a barnstorming pilot before heading to Alaska in 1922 to become a high-school teacher. Once there, Eielson quickly recognized the potential for aviation in Alaska and founded a commercial air service there operating between Fairbanks and the interior. In 1924 he set up the first airmail route in Alaska, but that operation lasted only a short time before losing its government contract.
Eielson returned to North Dakota but was soon approached by Wilkins about using aircraft for polar exploration. The two of them undertook test flights in 1926 and 1927 before their pioneering journey on April 15–16, 1928, when they traveled some 2,200 miles (3,550 km) above Arctic ice from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Svalbard (Spitzbergen), an island in the Arctic north of Norway. On December 20, 1928, the pair again made history with their 600-mile (970-km) flight over a portion of Antarctica. Eielson returned to Alaska to found another commercial aviation company, but he died shortly thereafter while attempting a rescue flight off the coast of Siberia. Mount Eielson, northeast of Denali (Mount McKinley) in Denali National Park and Preserve, is named for him.
