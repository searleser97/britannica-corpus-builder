Alan Bean, in full Alan LaVern Bean,  (born March 15, 1932, Wheeler, Texas, U.S.—died May 26, 2018, Houston, Texas), American astronaut and lunar module pilot on the Apollo 12 mission (November 14–22, 1969), during which two long walks totaling nearly eight hours were made on the Moon’s surface. Bean and commander Charles Conrad, Jr., piloted the lunar module Intrepid to a pinpoint landing near the unmanned U.S. spacecraft Surveyor 3, which had landed two years earlier, while astronaut Richard F. Gordon, Jr., orbited overhead in the command module Yankee Clipper.
Bean entered the U.S. Navy upon graduation (1955) from the University of Texas, Austin, and served as a test pilot before entering the manned spaceflight program in 1963. In addition to the Apollo 12 mission, Bean was commander of the Skylab 3 mission (July 28–September 25, 1973), during which he, science pilot Owen K. Garriott, and command module pilot Jack Lousma formed the second crew to occupy the orbiting laboratory. The 59 days they spent in space set a new record for the longest spaceflight.
Bean retired from the Navy in 1975 but remained with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as chief of the astronaut candidate operations and training group. In 1981 he resigned from NASA to pursue a career as a painter, specializing in subjects drawn from his spaceflight experience.
