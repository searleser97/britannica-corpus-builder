Voyager,   in aeronautics, American experimental aircraft that in 1986 became the first airplane to fly around the world without stops or refueling. Piloted by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, the craft took off on December 14 from Edwards Air Force Base, 60 miles (100 km) northeast of Los Angeles, and landed at that same base 9 days later after completing a course of 25,012 miles (40,251 km) around the world. The Voyager easily surpassed the previous record for unbroken, straight-line flight of 12,532 miles (20,167 km) that had been set in 1962. The Voyager made its round-the-world journey cruising at an average speed of about 116 miles per hour (186 km per hour).
Designed by Burt Rutan, the Voyager had its main wing (spanning 111 feet [33.8 m]) at the plane’s rear and had a horizontal stabilizer wing at the plane’s nose. The craft’s extremely light but strong body was made of layered pieces of carbon-fibre tape and epoxy-saturated paper that were glued together using epoxy resin. At the start of the journey, the fuselage, wings, and other frame elements were entirely filled with a quantity of fuel that weighed four times as much as the airplane’s 1,860-pound (840-kilogram) weight; all but a few gallons of fuel was used up during the flight.
