Elwood Haynes,  (born Oct. 14, 1857, Portland, Ind., U.S.—died  April 13, 1925, Kokomo, Ind.), American automobile pioneer who built one of the first automobiles.
He successfully tested his one-horsepower, one-cylinder vehicle at 6 or 7 miles (10 or 11 km) per hour on July 4, 1894, at Kokomo, Ind. Haynes claimed that he received the first U.S. traffic ticket when in 1895 a policeman on a bicycle ordered him and his automobile off the streets of Chicago. Now on exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., Haynes’s vehicle is the oldest American-made automobile in existence.
In partnership with Edgar and Elmer Apperson, Haynes formed the Haynes–Apperson Company, Kokomo, and began producing automobiles in 1898. Haynes and the Appersons split up in 1902, and three years later the company name was changed to Haynes Automobile Company. It ceased operations in 1925.
A trained engineer and chemist, Haynes discovered a number of alloys, including tungsten chrome steel (1881), a chromium and nickel alloy (1897), and a chromium and cobalt alloy (1900). He discovered a stainless steel in 1911 and patented it in 1919. He was the first to use aluminum in an automobile engine.
