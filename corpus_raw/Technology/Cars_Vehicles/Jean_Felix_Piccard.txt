Jean-Felix Piccard,  (born Jan. 28, 1884, Basel—died  Jan. 28, 1963, Minneapolis, Minn., U.S.), Swiss-born American chemical engineer and balloonist who conducted stratospheric flights for the purpose of cosmic-ray research.
The twin brother of Auguste Piccard, he graduated (1907) from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology with a degree in chemical engineering and then earned a doctorate in natural science (1909). He taught at the universities of Munich (1914), Lausanne (1914–16, 1919–25), and Chicago (1916–18). He became a U.S. citizen (1931) and lectured in aeronautical engineering at the University of Minnesota (1936–52) until his retirement.
He made his first balloon ascent in 1913 with his twin brother. On Oct. 23, 1934, with his wife, he made the first successful stratosphere flight through clouds, ascending to a height of 11 miles (18 km). In 1937 he made an ascent of 11,000 feet (3,350 m) to test a metal gondola attached to a cluster of 98 balloons. Later he developed a frost-resistant window for balloon gondolas and an electronic system for emptying ballast bags.
