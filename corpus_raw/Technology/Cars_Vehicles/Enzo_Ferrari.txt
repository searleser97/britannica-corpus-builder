Enzo Ferrari,  (born February 18, 1898, Modena, Italy—died August 14, 1988, Modena), Italian automobile manufacturer, designer, and racing-car driver whose Ferrari cars often dominated world racing competition in the second half of the 20th century.
Ferrari raced test cars for a small automobile company in Milan after World War I. In 1920 he became a racing-car driver for the Alfa Romeo Company, and in 1929 he formed a racing stable, Scuderia Ferrari, which remained Alfa Romeo’s official racing team even after Ferrari himself ceased to drive in races in 1932. The first racing car completely designed by Ferrari himself was built in 1937, for Alfa Romeo. In 1939 Ferrari severed his team’s connection with Alfa Romeo and founded the firm of Ferrari SpA, but the firm did not manufacture its first racing cars until 1946, after World War II. The firm’s cars soon became known for their formidable speed and handcrafted quality. Ferrari’s Formula 1 racers and sports cars won many Grand Prix races and manufacturers’ championships from the 1950s on, at times dominating the competition. The luxury sports cars the firm built earned a similar reputation for speed and precise handling.
Enzo Ferrari sold a 50 percent share of his company to Fiat SpA in 1969, but he remained president of the firm until 1977 and retained control over the Ferrari racing team until his death.
