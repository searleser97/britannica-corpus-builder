Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA),  European group of three spacecraft that are designed to search for gravitational radiation.
LISA is scheduled for launch in 2034. Funded by the European Space Agency, LISA will consist of three identical spacecraft that will trail Earth in its orbit around the Sun. Each spacecraft will be a cylinder 1.8 metres (5.9 feet) across and 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) high. The spacecraft will contain thrusters for maneuvering them into an equilateral triangle, with sides of approximately 5 million km (3 million miles), such that the triangle’s centre will be located along Earth’s orbit. If a gravity wave does pass through LISA, the distances between the spacecraft—and thus the interference pattern of the laser signals transmitted between them—will change. LISA will be the largest Michelson interferometer ever built.
