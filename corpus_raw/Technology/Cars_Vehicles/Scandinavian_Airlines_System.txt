Scandinavian Airlines System,  major international air travel company, formed by three national Scandinavian air carriers.
Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was established in 1946 through a consortium agreement between three Scandinavian airlines—Det Danske Luftfartselskab, a Danish airline; Den Norske Luftfartselskap, a Norwegian air carrier; and Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik AB, a Swedish airline. The new airline’s first intercontinental commercial flight, between Stockholm and New York, took place that same year. The three individual carriers handed over all operations to SAS by 1951. In the early 21st century SAS split into four separate carriers, one based in each of the three founding countries and another for international flights; all continued to use the SAS name. Today the SAS Group operates scheduled passenger, freight, and mail flights between more than 100 cities around the world.
