Walter Henry Zinn,  (born December 10, 1906, Kitchener, Ontario, Canada—died February 14, 2000, Clearwater, Florida, U.S.), Canadian-born nuclear physicist, who contributed to the U.S. atomic bomb project during World War II and to the development of the nuclear reactor.
In 1934 Zinn received a Ph.D. from Columbia University in New York. He was recruited by Enrico Fermi for the Manhattan Project, and it was he who, at the University of Chicago, withdrew a control rod from the atomic pile, releasing the world’s first self-sustaining nuclear reaction. He later supervised the dismantling of the pile and its removal to the Argonne National Laboratory (near Chicago), of which he was director (1946–56) before entering private business. In Idaho in 1951 he designed the first experimental breeder reactor. He also served as chief scientific adviser in the design of the U.S.S. Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered submarine. Zinn received numerous honours, including the Atoms for Peace Award (1960) and the Enrico Fermi Award (1969).
