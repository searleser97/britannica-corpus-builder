René Panhard,  (born 1841, Paris—died  1908, La Bourbole, Fr.), French automobile engineer and manufacturer who, with Émile Levassor, produced the first vehicle with an internal-combustion engine mounted at the front of the chassis rather than under the driver’s seat. Their vehicle became the prototype of the modern automobile. It had a sliding gear transmission and a differential gear with power transmitted to the rear axle by a chain drive.
Panhard, a graduate of the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, in 1886 joined Levassor, who had gained control of the French rights to the Daimler patents. In 1891–92 Panhard and Levassor built their vehicle with the front-mounted engine to Levassor’s design. It was put on sale in 1892 and competed successfully in early races.
