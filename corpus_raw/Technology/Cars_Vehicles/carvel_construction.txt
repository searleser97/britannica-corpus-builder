Carvel construction,   type of ship construction characteristic in Mediterranean waters during the Middle Ages, as contrasted with clinker construction in northern waters. In carvel construction the planks were fitted edge to edge against a previously built framework; hulls so constructed were smooth and well streamlined, but the work required more precision and skilled labour, and the hulls were more prone to weakness and leakage in heavy seas.
