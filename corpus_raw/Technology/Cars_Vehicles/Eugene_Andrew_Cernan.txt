Eugene Cernan, in full Eugene Andrew Cernan, byname Gene Cernan,  (born March 14, 1934, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died January 16, 2017, Houston, Texas), American astronaut who, as commander of Apollo 17 (December 7–17, 1972), was the last person to walk on the Moon.
Cernan graduated from Purdue University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1956 and was commissioned in the U.S. Navy that same year. He made some 200 landings on aircraft carriers as a naval aviator. In 1963 he earned a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. Later that year he was among the 14 people named to the third group of astronauts.
For Cernan’s first mission, he and Thomas P. Stafford were launched into space on June 3, 1966, in Gemini 9. Cernan became the second American to walk in space when he undertook more than two hours of extravehicular activity in what proved to be a dangerously faulty space suit. During the three-day mission, Gemini 9 rendezvoused three times with a target vehicle.
On May 18, 1969, Cernan, Stafford, and John W. Young began the eight-day mission of Apollo 10. As lunar module pilot, Cernan brought the landing craft into a close lunar orbit, approaching the surface to within 15 km (9 miles). Stafford and Cernan completed a complex series of orbital maneuvers before rejoining the command module. The mission performed every function necessary for a lunar landing but the landing itself, and it was the final test of Apollo systems.
Cernan commanded the Apollo 17 Moon flight (with Ronald Evans and Harrison Schmitt, December 7–19, 1972). He and Schmitt, a geologist, explored the Taurus-Littrow region of the Moon’s surface (December 11–14), collecting some 115 kg (249 pounds) of lunar rocks and other surface material for study. That mission concluded the Apollo Moon program. Cernan later assisted with the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (completed in July 1975), and in 1976 he resigned from the navy and the space program to enter private business.
In 1999 Cernan cowrote (with journalist Don Davis) The Last Man on the Moon. A documentary film of the same name was released in 2014.
