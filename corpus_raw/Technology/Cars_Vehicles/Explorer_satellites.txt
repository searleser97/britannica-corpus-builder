Explorer,  any of the largest series of unmanned U.S. spacecraft, consisting of 55 scientific satellites launched between 1958 and 1975. Explorer 1 (launched Jan. 31, 1958), the first space satellite orbited by the United States, discovered the innermost of the Van Allen radiation belts, two zones of charged particles that surround Earth. Explorer 1â€™s discovery of the Van Allen belts was the first scientific discovery made by an artificial satellite. Explorer 6 (launched Aug. 7, 1959) took the first pictures of Earth from orbit. Other notable craft in the series include Explorer 38 (launched July 4, 1968; also known as Radio Astronomy Explorer), which measured galactic radio sources and studied low frequencies in space, and Explorer 53 (launched May 7, 1975; also known as Small Astronomy Satellite-C), which was sent out to explore X-ray sources both inside and outside the Milky Way Galaxy.
