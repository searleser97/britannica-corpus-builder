Clermont, byname of North River Steamboat of Clermont,  the first steamboat in public service (1807), designed by American engineer Robert Fulton and built in New York City by Charles Brown with the financial backing of Robert Livingston.
Although named North River Steamboat of Clermont, it became known as the Clermont. The steamboat was 133 feet (41 metres) long and 12 feet (4 metres) wide and had a draft of 2 feet (0.6 metre). Engines built by Boulton and Watt in England drove the two side paddle wheels, each of which were 15 feet (5 metres) in diameter. On its first voyage, August 17, 1807, the Clermont averaged close to 5 miles (about 8 km) per hour for the 150 miles (240 km) up the Hudson River to Albany, New York. The Clermont inaugurated the first profitable venture in steam navigation, carrying paying passengers between Albany and New York City.
