Argus,  the first true aircraft carrier. Construction of the Argus began in 1914, and initially it was an Italian liner; it was purchased in 1916 by the British Royal Navy and converted, work being completed in September 1918. The Argus had an unobstructed flight deck about 560 feet (170.7 metres) long and a hangar that could accommodate 20 aircraft. It was armed with six four-inch guns and could reach a speed of 20.2 knots. In addition to serving as an operational carrier, the Argus was used for trials and training.
