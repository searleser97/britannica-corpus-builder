Grand Central Station, formally Grand Central Terminal,  railroad terminal in New York City. It was designed and built (1903–13) by Reed & Stem in collaboration with the firm of Warren & Wetmore; the latter firm is credited with the aesthetics of the huge structure. The concourse, with its 125-foot (43-metre) ceiling vault painted with constellations, was one of the largest enclosed spaces of its time. A gem of the Beaux-Arts style, the terminal looks as though it could have been transported from 1870s France. Atop the symmetrical main facade is a large clock and sculptures of an American eagle and Roman deities. In the late 20th century the station was lavishly restored; this restoration effort brought national attention to the importance of preserving architectural landmarks. Although popularly known as Grand Central Station, the terminal is formally called Grand Central Terminal. Some observers insist on making a distinction between the terminal and the subway station below it and note that the nearby U.S. Post Office is also referred to as “Grand Central Station.”
