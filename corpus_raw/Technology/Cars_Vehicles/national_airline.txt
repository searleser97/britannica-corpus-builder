Airline, national,  Air transportation services owned and operated by national governments. All U.S. airlines are privately owned, but many other countries have government-owned airlines. Often national airlines were founded as private services and later purchased by the government. The oldest airline in the English-speaking world, Qantas Airways, was founded privately in Australia in 1920 to provide taxi services and joy flights; it was purchased by the Australian government in 1947. Air France was formed in 1933 by the merger of four private airlines. British Airways was formed in 1974 through the merger of Britain’s European and overseas airlines, both already government-owned, in 1987 the British government sold it off through a huge stock offering. Other national airlines include Ireland’s Aer Lingus and Russia’s Aeroflot.
