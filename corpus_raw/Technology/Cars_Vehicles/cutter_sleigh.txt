Cutter,   lightweight, open, horse-drawn sleigh, introduced in the United States in about 1800. It usually had a single seat that held two people, but some contained a second one, which could be removed or jumped out of the way when not in use, for two additional passengers, and some had a childâ€™s seat that folded out when needed. They have been made in many different styles, but most have gracefully curved runners and decoratively coloured bodies. Cutters are still used occasionally in winter as a form of recreational transport, most often in the northeastern United States.
