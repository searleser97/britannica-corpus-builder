Rules of the road at sea,  internationally agreed-on traffic regulations for ocean waters. They were most recently revised in accordance with recommendations of the International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea in 1965. They are supplemented by national regulations for inland waters. The most important rules specify colour and arrangement of lights; size, shape, colour, and arrangement of daymarks; character, duration, and frequency of sound signals; and type of avoiding action for craft approaching each other, together with fixing of responsibility for taking action. Rules vary for power-driven and sailing vessels, and certain exceptions are made for small craft, naval vessels, and vessels of special construction.
