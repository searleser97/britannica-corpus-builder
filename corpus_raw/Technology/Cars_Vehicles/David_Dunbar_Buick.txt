David Dunbar Buick,  (born Sept. 17, 1854, Arbroath, Scot.—died  March 6, 1929, Detroit, Mich., U.S.), pioneer American automobile manufacturer, after whom the Buick line of automobiles is named.
Buick was taken to the United States in 1856. His first independent business venture was a company that made plumbing equipment, started in 1884. In about 1899 he became interested in gasoline engines for agricultural and marine purposes, and in 1902 he formed the Buick Manufacturing Company with the aim of producing engines for automobiles. He built his first automobile in early 1903. Buick was a capable inventor, and he originated the valve-in-head engine and the windshield. His company soon ran into debt, however, and in late 1903 the two Detroit manufacturers who had financed it merged Buick’s company with the Flint Wagon Works to form the Buick Motor Car Company. Under the management of James Whiting and with the talents of William C. Durant, who joined the firm in 1904, the reorganized Buick company quickly expanded its production, making more than 8,000 cars in 1908. Durant took over the company in November 1904. Buick, meanwhile, left the company in 1906 and engaged in further, unsuccessful business ventures that were unconnected with automotive manufacturing.
