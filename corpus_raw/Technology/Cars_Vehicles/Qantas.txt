Qantas, in full Qantas Airways Limited,  Australian airline, the oldest in the English-speaking world, founded in 1920 as Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Ltd. (from which the name Qantas was derived). Its first operations were taxi services and pleasure flights. By the early 21st century, however, its scheduled air routes extended throughout Asia, Australia, the Americas, Europe, and New Zealand. The airline’s headquarters are in Sydney.
Qantas’s first regular service, between Charleville and Cloncurry, began in 1922; in the following years other local routes were added. In 1934 Qantas and Britain’s Imperial Airways (later BOAC) formed Qantas Empire Airways Limited to operate the Brisbane-Singapore leg of service from Australia to England. In 1947 the Australian Commonwealth government purchased Qantas and designated the company Australia’s flag carrier. In the same year, Qantas began regular through service to London on the “Kangaroo Route.” Within a decade it was flying to all the continents. The name Qantas Airways Limited was adopted in 1967. Qantas acquired Australian Airlines, Ltd., in 1992, thus becoming the country’s largest airline. The following year it was privatized by the Australian government.
As with other airlines, Qantas faced increasing financial difficulties in the early 21st century, resulting in staffing cuts and the elimination of some routes. Notably, it began operating an international subsidiary airline, Australian Airlines, in 2002 but closed it four years later. In 2004 Qantas launched the low-cost carrier Jetstar to compete in the budget market.
