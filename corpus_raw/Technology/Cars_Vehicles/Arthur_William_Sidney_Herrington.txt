Arthur William Sidney Herrington,  (born March 30, 1891, Coddenham, East Suffolk, Eng.—died  Sept. 6, 1970, Indianapolis, Ind., U.S.), American engineer and manufacturer who developed a series of military vehicles, the best known of which was the World War II jeep.
Immigrating to the United States with his family at the age of five, Herrington grew up in Madison, N.J., and was educated at the Stevens Preparatory School and Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, N.J. He was first employed by the Harley-Davidson Motor Company of Milwaukee. After World War I he was given a reserve commission in the Army and was retained as a consultant while returning to his civilian occupation. In France, Herrington had been impressed by the problems of conventional-drive vehicles in off-the-road maneuvering. He experimented with and designed a series of trucks with four- and six-wheel drives, which he built in association with the Marmon Motor Car Company of Indianapolis, Ind. These vehicles aided Allied troops during World War II; but none equaled the success and popularity of the smallest of the line, the quarter-ton jeep (apparently from the letters GP, for “general purpose”) reconnaissance car, noted for its outstanding stamina, versatility, power, and maneuverability.
Herrington served during World War II as technical adviser to the American Mission to India and as director of the American Medical Center for Burma.
