Mariner,  any of a series of unmanned U.S. space probes sent to the vicinities of Venus, Mars, and Mercury. Mariner 1 (launched July 22, 1962) was intended to fly by Venus, but it was destroyed shortly after liftoff when it veered off course. Mariners 2 (launched Aug. 27, 1962) and 5 (launched June 14, 1967) passed Venus within 35,000 and 4,000 km (22,000 and 2,500 miles), respectively, and made measurements of temperature and atmospheric density. Mariner 3 (launched Nov. 5, 1964) was supposed to fly by Mars, but contact was lost shortly after liftoff. Mariners 4 (launched Nov. 28, 1964), 6 and 7 (launched Feb. 24 and March 27, 1969, respectively), and 9 (launched May 30, 1971) obtained striking photographs of the Martian surface and made significant analyses of the atmosphere of that planet. Mariner 8 (launched May 8, 1971) was intended to study Mars with Mariner 9, but its upper stage malfunctioned shortly after launch. Mariner 10 (launched Nov. 3, 1973), which flew by Venus once and Mercury three times, came within 330 km (200 miles) of the latter planet on its third pass; it transmitted back to Earth the first close-up pictures of Mercuryâ€™s surface, as well as analyses of its atmosphere and magnetic field.
