Enterprise,  the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, launched in 1960 and commissioned by the U.S. Navy in 1961. Powered by eight nuclear reactors (two for each of its four propellers), the Enterprise—which displaced about 75,000 tons and had a flight deck of 1,101 by 252 feet (336 by 77 metres)—cruised more than 200,000 miles (320,000 km) over three years before requiring refueling. In addition to endurance, its nuclear reactors gave the ship greater space for aviation fuel, ordnance, and stores—important advantages over oil-powered carriers. With a top speed of more than 30 knots, it was said to be the fastest warship afloat. The Enterprise served in conflicts from the Cuban missile crisis (1962) to the Iraq War (2003–11). It was retired in 2012.
