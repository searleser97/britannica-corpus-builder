Holland,   submersible vessel considered the principal forerunner of the modern submarine, designed by John Holland for the United States Navy and accepted by the Navy in 1900. It was 53 feet (16 metres) long, displaced 74 tons, and was armed with a gun that could fire a 100-pound (45-kilogram) projectile half a mile (about 0.8 kilometre). Its hull was cigar-shaped, and the tanks were flooded for submersion, two features similar to those of modern submarines. The “Holland” had an apparatus that took it to a predetermined depth and another device that kept it level. For surface cruising it was powered by a gasoline engine; this also served to turn a generator to charge the batteries that provided the current for the electric motors used for underwater propulsion. The “Holland” had a surface speed of seven knots (nautical miles per hour).
