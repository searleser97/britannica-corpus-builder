Ettore Arco Isidoro Bugatti,  (born Sept. 15, 1881, Milan, Italy—died  Aug. 21, 1947, Paris, Fr.), builder of racing and luxury automobiles who founded a factory at Molsheim, Alsace, in 1909 and shortly thereafter produced a highly successful low-powered racer for Le Mans. His Type 22 and Type 35 models also were exceptional. Type 41 (“Golden Bugatti,” or “La Royale”), produced in the 1920s, was probably the most meticulously built of all cars and one of the most costly; only a few (six to eight) were constructed. The Bugatti firm did not survive very long after Ettore Bugatti’s death, at least in part because his eldest son and successor-to-be died before him.
