Hans Werner Grosse,  (born November 28, 1922, Swinemünde, Germany), German glider pilot who on April 25, 1972, set the world record (broken 2003) for straight-line distance soaring by flying 1,460.5 km (907.7 miles) from the Baltic Sea to the Spanish border near Biarritz, France, more than 274 km (170 miles) farther than the old record. Grosse, an enthusiastic glider pilot since his teens, was a Luftwaffe pilot during World War II.
Grosse’s record-breaking glider, an AS W-12, weighed 324 kg (716 pounds) and had a wingspan of 18.95 metres (62.2 feet) and a top speed of 220 km/hr (137 miles per hour). On January 4, 1981, he set a world record of 1,306.856 km (811.56 miles) for distance around a triangular course. Earlier, on December 9, 1980, he set a world record for speed (133.242 km/hr) over a 1,250-kilometre triangular course and, on December 24, 1980, a record for speed (158.67 km/hr) over a 300-kilometre triangular course. With H.H. Kohlmeier he also set multiplace records of 970.95 km (602.96 miles) for distance to a fixed point and return (January 7, 1980), distance around a triangular course of 1,112.62 km (December 12, 1979), speed over a 750-kilometre triangular course of 131.84 km/hr (January 14, 1980), and speed over a 1000-kilometre triangular course of 129.54 km/hr (December 12, 1979). All of these records were set at Alice Springs, Australia.
