Konstantin Petrovich Feoktistov,  (born February 7, 1926, Voronezh, Russia, U.S.S.R.—died November 21, 2009, Moscow, Russia), Russian spacecraft designer and cosmonaut who took part, with Vladimir M. Komarov and Boris B. Yegorov, in the world’s first multimanned spaceflight, Voskhod 1 (1964).
When Voronezh was occupied in World War II, Feoktistov, who was then only 16 years old, worked as a scout for the Soviet army. He was captured by the Germans and sentenced to death by firing squad. Shot through the neck, he feigned death and escaped from a burial trench. He later attended Moscow N.E. Bauman Higher Technical School and worked for a time as a factory engineer. In 1955 he earned the equivalent of a Ph.D. and from that time worked in the Soviet space program designing spacecraft and equipment.
Feoktistov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour after the launching of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 (October 4, 1957), and again after the first successful manned flight by Yury Gagarin (April 12, 1961). During the flight of Voskhod 1, October 12–13, 1964, Feoktistov carried out extensive scientific experiments and observations beyond the capability of previous cosmonauts. Voskhod 1, in addition to being the first spacecraft to carry more than one man, was the first to carry specialists (a doctor and an engineer) and the first to make a soft landing on the ground. After the Voskhod 1 flight, Feoktistov returned to engineering and played a major role in designing the Salyut and Mir space stations.
