Wing,  in aeronautics, an airfoil that helps lift a heavier-than-air craft. When positioned above the fuselage (high wings), wings provide an unrestricted view below and good lateral stability. Parasol wings, placed on struts high above the fuselage of seaplanes, help keep the engine from water spray.
Midwings, positioned in the middle of the fuselage, leave the airplane belly free of spars, with room for bombs or cargo. Placed below the fuselage, low wings reduce the height of the undercarriage and simplify engine maintenance.
