Unisys Corporation,  American technology consulting company that originated as a manufacturer of computer systems. The company was formed in 1986 from the merger of the Sperry Corporation and the Burroughs Corporation.
The Sperry Corporation arose out of the merger of North American Aviation Company, Curtiss-Wright Corporation, and Sperry Gyroscope in 1933. The corporation specialized in the manufacture of gyroscopes and other aeronautical machinery, machine tools, and heavy and precision machinery. In 1955 Sperry merged with Remington Rand, Inc., becoming Sperry Rand Corporation. Remington Rand had been formed in 1927, combining several manufacturers of office machines and business equipment, including the Remington Typewriter Company (established in 1873) and the Rand Kardex Bureau (formed in 1886). Remington Rand’s main business had developed around typewriters, business machines, and electric shavers. Sperry Rand Corporation was renamed Sperry Corporation in 1979.
The Burroughs Corporation began as the Burroughs Adding Machine Company in 1905, producing the world’s first practical adding machines, which had been perfected by the inventor William Seward Burroughs a decade or so before. The company succeeded Burroughs’ own American Arithmometer Company. The Burroughs Adding Machine Company became the world’s largest manufacturer of such devices, and in the 1950s and ’60s it branched out into the manufacture of computer systems for business and office uses. It was renamed the Burroughs Corporation in 1953.
Before the 1986 merger, Sperry mainly produced military electronics systems and computer systems for use in the transportation and utilities industries. Burroughs had concentrated on computer systems for banking and other financial uses. Since 1994 Unisys has been a leading provider of information technology services to businesses and governments.
