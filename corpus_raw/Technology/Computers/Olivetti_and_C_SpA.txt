Olivetti & C. SpA, in full Ing. C. Olivetti & C. SpA (Italian: Eng[ineer] C. Olivetti and Company Ltd.),  Italian multinational firm that manufactures office equipment and information systems. Headquarters are in Ivrea, Italy.
Founded by Camillo Olivetti (1868–1943), an electrical engineer, the company began making typewriters in 1908. In 1925 Olivetti dispatched his son Adriano Olivetti to study modern manufacturing techniques and plant management in the United States. Upon his return, the company underwent a complete reorganization that included streamlining and modernizing operations and development of a new typewriter design, the M-40, which won wide acceptance in the 1930s.
In 1938 the younger Olivetti succeeded his father as president. Under his leadership the company emerged as Italy’s second leading exporter of mechanical devices and Europe’s principal manufacturer of typewriters and business machines. The company also manufactures calculators, microcomputers, writing systems, and related goods.
Olivetti entered into a joint venture with Sharp Corp. of Japan in 1982 to produce together high-speed copiers and other office machines. That same year Docutel Corp., an electronics company and leading American manufacturer of automated teller machines, purchased Olivetti Corp., an American subsidiary of the company. The merger agreement made Olivetti & C. SpA the largest single stockholder in Docutel, which accordingly changed its name to Docutel/Olivetti Corp. In 1983 a quarter of Olivetti’s corporate stock was purchased by American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) in an arrangement that made Olivetti a major distributor of AT&T products in Europe.
