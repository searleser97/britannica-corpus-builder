Netbook,  informal classification for a variety of small, low-cost mobile personal computers (PCs) used primarily for e-mail and Internet access.
Netbooks split the difference between traditional, full-service laptop PCs, or notebooks, and smaller, more-limited devices such as Web-enabled “smart phones” and personal desktop assistants (PDAs). Most models retail for significantly less than traditional laptops, weigh less than a kilogram (less than two pounds), and typically feature display screens that measure only about 25 cm (10 inches) diagonally. Keyboards may be up to 20 percent smaller than those used on standard laptops. Early netbooks ran either Microsoft Corporation’s Windows XP Home Edition or a custom configuration of the free operating system Linux. Typically, netbooks support Internet communication via high-speed Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Their size precludes optical storage devices, but they usually include slots for solid-state flash memory cards.
Netbooks, by virtue of their limited memory and processing speed, are ill-suited for most conventional computing tasks, though many models will run limited versions of basic business software. They offer highly portable access to e-mail and the Internet and are ideal for “cloud computing”—in which software applications are run over the Web rather than from the computer’s operating system and files are stored online rather than on a local hard drive.
The term netbook was coined by  Intel Corporation, an American integrated circuit (IC) manufacturer, in the marketing of their Centrino Atom processor, a low-power IC that was used in all of the first-generation netbooks when they came out in 2007. Less than a year later, most major PC manufacturers had introduced netbook models, and sales of netbooks had grown to rival those of other portable electronic devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone.
