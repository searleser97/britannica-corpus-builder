Rootkit,  a form of malicious software, or malware, that infects the “root-level” of a computer’s hard drive, making it impossible to remove without completely erasing the drive. Typically, a personal computer (PC) becomes infected with a rootkit when the owner installs some software obtained over the Internet, especially copyrighted software that has been distributed illegally. Infected computers are often used by cybercriminals for the distribution of spam and pornography.
In efforts to curb copyright infringement, or piracy, some computer software makers and music companies secretly install detection software on users’ machines. For example, it was revealed in 2005 that the Sony Corporation had been secretly installing rootkits as its music compact discs (CDs) were loaded into PCs. The rootkit was discovered because of the way that it collected information on users’ PCs and sent the data back to Sony. The revelation turned into a public relations disaster, which forced the company to abandon the practice. Monitoring users’ data, with or without installing rootkits, continues in the software industry.
