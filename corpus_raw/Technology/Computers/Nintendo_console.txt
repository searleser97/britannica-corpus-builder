Nintendo console,  groundbreaking eight-bit video game console created by Japanese designer Uemura Masayuki. The Nintendo console, or Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), was released as the Famicom in Japan on July 15, 1983. The Famicom offered the ability to play popular arcade games such as Donkey Kong on a home television set and was extremely well received. The console’s success in Japan triggered American interest, and negotiations began in order to bring the NES to the United States. After a 1985 showing at the Consumer Electronics Show and a limited release, the NES stormed America in February 1986, with titles such as Duck Hunt, Hogan’s Alley, and, most famously, Super Mario Bros. More than 60 million NES consoles were sold, released and distributed under various names and through several companies worldwide.
One of the NES’s strengths was its library of games. Super Mario Bros. became the face of the system as gamers embraced Mario and Luigi, two plumbers who traveled through the Mushroom Kingdom to save Princess Toadstool from the evil Bowser. The Mario Bros. franchise went on to generate numerous sequels on the NES and other consoles. Another landmark title, The Legend of Zelda, also spawned many sequels. The Legend of Zelda franchise differs from game to game, but it usually focuses on the adventures of Link, a green-clad, sword-toting hero, in his quest to save Princess Zelda.
The NES eventually faded from the spotlight as new 16-bit consoles were created, such as the Sega Genesis and Nintendo’s own Super Nintendo Entertainment System. However, games were still released for the NES into the 1990s, until licensed production on a library of more than 1,000 titles ceased in 1994. The NES, though less technologically advanced than newer consoles, remained a popular choice for “retro” gamers into the 21st century.
