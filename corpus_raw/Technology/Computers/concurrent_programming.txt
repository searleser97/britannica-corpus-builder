concurrent programming,  computer programming in which, during a period of time, multiple processes are being executed. For example, two processes can be interleaved so that they are executed in turns. Parallel computing is similar but with multiple processes being executed at the same time on multiple processors, where more than one processor is used to execute a program or complex of programs running simultaneously. The term parallel computing is also used for programming designed for a multitasking environment, where two or more programs share the same memory while running concurrently.
