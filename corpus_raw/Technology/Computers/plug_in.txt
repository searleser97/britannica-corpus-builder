Plug-in, also called add-on or extension,  computer software that adds new functions to a host program without altering the host program itself. Widely used in digital audio, video, and Web browsing, plug-ins enable programmers to update a host program while keeping the user within the programâ€™s environment.
Plug-ins first gained popularity in the 1990s as software and microprocessors became more powerful. One of the first programs to make extensive use of plug-ins was Adobe Photoshop, an image-processing and editing program. Early plug-ins provided enhanced functions such as special effects, filters, and other options for manipulating images within Photoshop.
Contemporary plug-ins add a great deal of flexibility to many computer programs. Although a word processor or Web browser may initially be well designed, software designers cannot anticipate all possible functions that future users may want. If a program does not have a plug-in architecture, a user has to either switch between two programs to get a job done or hope that the desired function will be included in the next software update. A plug-in circumvents such difficulties by integrating with the host program. In the case of a Web browser, plug-ins can enable a browser to display additional content it was not originally designed to display, such as sounds, images, or specially coded files (for instance, Adobe Acrobat files).
Additionally, by sharing plug-in architecture with other companies, software developers create useful synergies between their own products and a variety of related products. Each plug-in enhances the value of the host program, and the success of the host program enhances the value of the plug-ins.
