computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM),  data-driven automation that affects all systems or subsystems within a manufacturing environment: design and development, production (see CAD/CAM), marketing and sales, and field support and service. Basic manufacturing functions, as well as materials-handling and inventory control, can also be simulated by computers before the system is built in an attempt to eliminate wastage. See also artificial intelligence; expert systems; robotics.
