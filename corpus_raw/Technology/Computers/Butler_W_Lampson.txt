Butler W. Lampson,  (born 1943, Washington, D.C.), computer scientist and winner of the 1992 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for “contributions to the development of distributed, personal computing environments and the technology for their implementation: workstations, networks, operating systems, programming systems, displays, security and document publishing.”
Lampson received a bachelor’s degree (1964) in physics from Harvard University and a doctorate (1967) in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley. After finishing his studies, Lampson joined the faculty at Berkeley (1967–71) and was the director of systems development at the Berkeley Computer Corporation (1969–71). Lampson moved on to research positions at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC; 1971–83), where he assisted in the development of Alto (the first personal computer) and Ethernet; the Digital Equipment Corporation (1984–95); and the Microsoft Corporation (1995– ). Lampson holds all or part of several dozen computer science patents.
Lampson was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (1984), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1993), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM; 1994), and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (2005). In addition to the Turing Award, Lampson received an ACM Software System Award (1984), an IEEE Computer Pioneer Award (1996), a National Institute of Standards and Technology/National Security Agency National Computer Systems Security Award (1998), an IEEE von Neumann Medal (2001), and a U.S. National Academy of Engineering Charles Stark Draper Prize (2004).
