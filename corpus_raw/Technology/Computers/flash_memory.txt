Flash memory,  data-storage medium used with computers and other electronic devices. Unlike previous forms of data storage, flash memory is an EEPROM (electronically erasable programmable read-only memory) form of computer memory and thus does not require a power source to retain the data.
Flash memory was invented in the early 1980s by Japanese engineer Masuoka Fujio, who was then working at the Toshiba Corporation and who was searching for a technology that would replace existing data-storage media such as magnetic tapes, floppy disks, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips. The name flash was coined by Ariizumi Shoji, a coworker of Masuoka, who said the process of memory erasure, which can erase all the data on an entire chip at one time, was like a cameraâ€™s flash.
Flash memory consists of a grid that has two transistors, the floating gate and the control gate, at each intersection, separated by an oxide layer that insulates the floating gate. When the floating gate is linked to the control gate, the two-transistor cell has a value of 1. To change the value of the cell to 0, a voltage is applied to the control gate that pushes electrons through the oxide layer into the floating gate. Storing the electrons in the floating gate allows the flash memory to retain its data when power is turned off. A voltage is applied to the cell to change the value back to 1. Flash memory is configured such that large sections of a chip, called blocks, or even the entire chip can be erased at a time.
Portable devices such as digital cameras, smartphones, and MP3 players normally use flash memory. USB drives (also called thumb drives and flash drives) and memory cards use flash memory to store data. As its cost became cheaper in the early 21st century, flash memory also began appearing as the hard disk in laptop computers.
