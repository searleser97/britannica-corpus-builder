scanner, also called optical scanner,  computer input device that uses a light beam to scan codes, text, or graphic images directly into a computer or computer system. Bar-code scanners are used widely at point-of-sale terminals in retail stores. A handheld scanner or bar-code pen is moved across the code, or the code itself is moved by hand across a scanner built into a checkout counter or other surface, and the computer stores or immediately processes the data in the bar code. After identifying the product through its bar code, the computer determines its price and feeds that information into the cash register. Optical scanners are also used in fax machines and to input graphic material directly into personal computers. Flatbed scanners have a top that lifts up, and the operator has to change manually the materials being scanned. Sheetfed scanners can be loaded with multiple loose pages, which are passed over the scanner by rollers. See also OCR.
