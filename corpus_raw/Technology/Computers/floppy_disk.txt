Floppy disk, or diskette,  magnetic storage medium used with late 20th-century computers. Floppy disks were popular from the 1970s until the late 1990s, when they were supplanted by the increasing use of e-mail attachments and other means to transfer files from computer to computer. They were made of flexible plastic coated with a magnetic material and enclosed in a hard square plastic case. The first floppy disks were 8 inches (20 cm) across. In the late 1970s, floppy disks became smaller, with the arrival of 5.25-inch (13.3-cm) models, and the final floppy disks, which debuted in the 1980s, were 3.5 inches (9 cm) in diameter. Data were arranged on the surface of a disk in concentric tracks. The disk was inserted in the computerâ€™s floppy disk drive, an assembly of magnetic heads and a mechanical device for rotating the disk for reading or writing purposes. A small electromagnet, called a magnetic head, wrote a binary digit (1 or 0) onto the disk by magnetizing a tiny spot on the disk in different directions and read digits by detecting the magnetization direction of the spots.
