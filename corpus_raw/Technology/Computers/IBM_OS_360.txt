IBM OS/360, in full International Business Machines Operating System/360,  an operating system introduced by IBM in 1964 to operate its 360 family of mainframe computer systems. The 360 system was unprecedented in its ability to support a wide array of applications, and it was one of the first operating systems to require direct-access storage devices.
The name 360 was chosen to convey that a single system could support a full range of machines, though three versions of the operating system existed. OS/360 PCP (Principal Control Program) was the simplest and could run only one program at a time. IBM used it in-house for developing other systems. OS/360 MFT (Multiple Programming with a Fixed Number of Tasks) could run several programs but only after partitioning the memory required to run each; its limitation was that, if one program was idle, memory devoted to it was inaccessible by other programs. OS/MVT (Multiple Programming with a Variable Number of Tasks) allowed memory divisions to be re-created as needed. Whenever memory was available, the system searched a queue of jobs for any that could be run on available memory. OS/MVT was also able to allocate all a computerâ€™s memory to a single large job, creating a versatility unavailable in other operating systems.
With the advent of virtual addressing hardware, or virtual memory, a process in which discontiguous computer memory is made to appear contiguous (and thus sufficient) to applications, OS/MFT was renamed OS/VS1, and OS/MVT became OS/VS2. OS/VS2 later became the standard system, OS/MVS (Multiple Virtual Spaces). As of 2000, OS/360 entered the public domain, making it freely available for download by users and developers.
