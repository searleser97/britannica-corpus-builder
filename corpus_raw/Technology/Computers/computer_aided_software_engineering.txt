Computer-aided software engineering (CASE),  use of computers in designing sophisticated tools to aid the software engineer and to automate the software development process as much as possible. It is particularly useful where major software products are designed by teams of engineers who may not share the same physical space. CASE tools can be used for simple operations, such as routine coding from an appropriately detailed design in a specific programming language, or for more complex tasks, such as incorporating an expert system to enforce design rules and eliminate software defects and redundancies before the coding phase.
