Byte,  the basic unit of information in computer storage and processing. A byte consists of 8 adjacent binary digits (bits), each of which consists of a 0 or 1. (Originally, a byte was any string of more than one bit that made up a simple piece of information like a single character. Thus, for example, there were four- or six-bit bytes, but eventually the standard settled on eight bits.) The string of bits making up a byte is processed as a unit by a computer; bytes are the smallest operable units of storage in computer technology. A byte can represent the equivalent of a single character, such as the letter B, a comma, or a percentage sign, or it can represent a number from 0 to 255. Because a byte contains so little information, the processing and storage capacities of computer hardware are usually given in gigabytes (GB; one billion bytes) and terabytes (TB; one trillion bytes). Because the byte had its roots in binary digits, originally one kilobyte was not 1,000 bytes but 1,024 bytes (1,024 = 210), and thus one megabyte (MB) was 1,024 Ã— 1,024 bytes and so on. However, with some notable exceptions such as the Microsoft Windows operating system, the computer industry has switched over to decimal prefixes, in which prefixes denote a thousandfold increase in bytes.
