cellular automata (CA),  model of a spatially distributed process that consists of an array (usually two-dimensional) of cells that “evolve” step-by-step according to the state of neighbouring cells and certain rules that depend on the simulation. CAs can be used to simulate various real-world processes. They were invented in the 1940s by American mathematicians John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Though apparently simple, some CAs are universal computers; that is, they can do any computer-capable computation. The best-known cellular automaton, John Conway’s “Game of Life” (1970), simulates the processes of life, death, and population dynamics.
