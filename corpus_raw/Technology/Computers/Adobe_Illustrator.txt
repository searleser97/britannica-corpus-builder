Adobe Illustrator,  graphics computer application software produced by Adobe Systems Incorporated that allows users to create refined drawings, designs, and layouts. Illustrator, released in 1987, is one of many Adobe innovations that revolutionized graphic design.
Adobe Systems was founded in 1982 by American mathematicians John Warnock and Chuck Geschke and burst onto the Silicon Valley scene with PostScript, a vector-based program—using lines defined by mathematical formulas, as opposed to individual bit- or pixel-based descriptions—that vastly improved publishing quality and was instrumental in the so-called desktop-publishing revolution. PostScript’s success allowed Adobe to explore more avenues of innovation, and in 1986 Adobe turned its attention to graphic design. Engineer Mike Schuster was assigned the task of creating an easy-to-use drawing program with PostScript language that would allow users to create complicated page layouts. Illustrator, Adobe’s first software application, was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh. Among its most significant features was its pen tool, which enabled the user to draw smooth curves and create high-resolution shapes and images. In 1989 Adobe released Illustrator for Microsoft Windows personal computers. Through the years, Illustrator continued to expand, adding support for TrueType (a font format created by Apple and Microsoft to compete with Adobe’s PostScript fonts), more-complex drawing tools, an ever increasing number of drawing “layers” (which can be quickly undone), and support for three-dimensional figures. In addition, the company improved usability through greater convergence of its user interfaces for its various programs.
Illustrator remains one of Adobe’s premier products. In 2003 Adobe released the Adobe Creative Suite, which bundled together Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and Acrobat.
