RISC, in full Reduced Instruction Set Computer,  information processing using any of a family of microprocessors that are designed to execute computing tasks with the simplest instructions in the shortest amount of time possible. RISC is the opposite of CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer).
RISC microprocessors, or chips, take advantage of the fact that most of the instructions for computer processes are relatively simple and computers are designed to handle those simple instructions extremely quickly. RISC chips streamline and accelerate data processing by minimizing the number of instructions permanently stored in the microprocessor and by relying more on nonresident instruction (i.e., software programs, or code).
In contrast, CISC chips have a large, complex resident instruction set. Therefore, they typically process complex codes more quickly. RISC chips must break the complicated code down into simpler units before they can execute it. Furthermore, software developed for use with RISC computer systems must provide a larger instruction set than software for CISC systems to compensate for the small, simple instructions that are built in.
RISC evolved primarily through research at International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation, Stanford University, and the University of California, Berkeley. RISC microprocessors were initially used in workstations and other high-end computer systems, while CISC dominated the less powerful personal computer (PC) market. However, beginning in the mid-1990s, RISC technology was integrated into PCs and, in the early 21st century, into mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers.
