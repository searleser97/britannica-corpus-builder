Howard Aiken, in full Howard Hathaway Aiken,  (born March 9, 1900, Hoboken, New Jersey, U.S.—died March 14, 1973, St. Louis, Missouri), mathematician who invented the Harvard Mark I, forerunner of the modern electronic digital computer.
Aiken did engineering work while he attended the University of Wisconsin, Madison. After completing his doctorate at Harvard University in 1939, he remained there for a short period to teach before undertaking war work for the U.S. Navy Board of Ordnance.
With three other engineers—Clair D. Lake, B.M. Durfee, and F.E. Hamilton—Aiken began work in 1939 on an automatic calculating machine that could perform any selected sequence of five arithmetical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and reference to previous results) without human intervention. The first such machine, the Mark I, was completed by Aiken and his partners in February 1944: 51 feet (15.3 m) long and 8 feet (2.4 m) high, it weighed 35 tons (31,500 kg) and contained about 500 miles (800 km) of wire and more than 3,000,000 connections. The Mark I was programmed to solve problems by means of a paper tape on which coded instructions were punched. Once so programmed, the calculator could be operated by persons with little training. The Mark I was used by the U.S. Navy for work in gunnery, ballistics, and design. Continuing his work, Aiken completed an improved all-electric Mark II in 1947. He also authored numerous articles on electronics, switching theory, and data processing.
