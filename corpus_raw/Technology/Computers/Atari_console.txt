Atari console,  video game console released in 1977 by the North American game manufacturer Atari, Inc. Using a cartridge-based system that allowed users to play a variety of video games, the Atari console marked the beginning of a new era in home gaming systems.
Developed by Atari cofounder Nolan Bushnell and a team of designers, the console connected to a standard television set and employed computer chips that featured full-colour graphics and sound. The system, originally called the Atari VCS (Video Computer System), came bundled with two joysticks, two paddle controllers, and one game cartridge. Nine games were initially offered for it. The system was also sold at Sears department stores under the name Sears Video Arcade.
Success was assured in 1980 after Atari released a home version of the Japanese video game Space Invaders. Sales doubled as millions purchased the console to play the popular arcade game at home. The original console was renamed Atari 2600 following the release of the more advanced Atari 5200, and a variety of other titles were developed for it, including Adventure, Asteroids, Breakout, Demon Attack, Frogger, Pac-Man, and Pong.
With sales of more than 30 million over a span of three decades, the Atari 2600 became one of the most popular gaming systems in history. Although production of the console halted in the early 1990s, the system still enjoys popularity among classic game aficionados, who continue to develop new games for it. In 2004 Atari released the Atari Flashback 2, which contains 40 classic games and mimics the look of the original Atari 2600, including the iconic joystick, for play on newer console systems and personal computers (PCs). Atari continues to make games for PCs and all the major consoles.
