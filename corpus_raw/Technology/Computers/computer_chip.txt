computer chip, also called chip,  integrated circuit or small wafer of semiconductor material embedded with integrated circuitry. Chips comprise the processing and memory units of the modern digital computer (see microprocessor; RAM). Chip making is extremely precise and is usually done in a “clean room,” since even microscopic contamination could render a chip defective. As transistor components shrank, the number per chip doubled about every 18 months (a phenomenon known as Moore’s law), from a few thousand in 1971 (Intel Corp.’s first chip) to more than 10 billion in 2016. Nanotechnology made transistors even smaller and chips correspondingly more powerful as the technology advanced.
