COBOL, in full Common Business-Oriented Language,  high-level computer programming language, one of the first widely used languages and for many years the most popular language in the business community. It developed from the 1959 Conference on Data Systems Languages, a joint initiative between the U.S. government and the private sector. COBOL was created to fulfill two major objectives: portability (ability of programs to be run with minimum modification on computers from different manufacturers) and readability (ease with which a program can be read like ordinary English). Although COBOLâ€™s popularity declined beginning in the 1990s, many large organizations, such as banks and government agencies, still used the language in the early 21st century.
