computer architecture,  structure of a digital computer, encompassing the design and layout of its instruction set and storage registers. The architecture of a computer is chosen with regard to the types of programs that will be run on it (business, scientific, general-purpose, etc.). Its principal components or subsystems, each of which could be said to have an architecture of its own, are input/output, storage, communication, control, and processing.
