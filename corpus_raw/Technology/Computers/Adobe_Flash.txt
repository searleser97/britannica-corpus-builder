Adobe Flash,  animation software produced by Adobe Systems Incorporated.
The development of Adobe Flash software can be traced back to American software developer Jonathan Gay’s first experiments with writing programs on his Apple II computer in high school during the 1980s. Before long, Gay had written a graphics program for the Apple II using Pascal. Later, he teamed up with a local Macintosh users-group organizer, Charlie Jackson, who started a Macintosh software company called Silicon Beach Software. At Silicon Beach Software, Gay combined animation and digital sound to create the Macintosh electronic game Airborne!. Eventually, in his drive to create animation software compatible with Apple Inc.’s Macintosh and Microsoft Corporation’s Windows programs, he produced SmartSketch, a program in which users could draw on the computer screen with an electronic pen. This was the start of his own software company, FutureWave Software, in the mid-1990s.
As the Internet grew in popularity, FutureWave added two-dimensional animation features to SmartSketch that let Internet users display graphics and animation over the World Wide Web, and FutureSplash Animator was born. The program’s first success came when Microsoft used the software for their MSN Web site. Macromedia, Inc., bought the rights to FutureSplash Animator in 1996, creating Macromedia Flash, which became Adobe Flash after Adobe purchased Macromedia in 2005. Adobe Flash allows users to create animation for use on the Internet, and Adobe’s Flash Player is one of the most widely distributed applications on the Internet.
