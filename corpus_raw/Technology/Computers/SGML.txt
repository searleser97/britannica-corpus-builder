SGML, in full standard generalized markup language,  an international computer standard for the definition of markup languages; that is, it is a metalanguage. Markup consists of notations called “tags,” which specify the function of a piece of text or how it is to be displayed. SGML emphasizes descriptive markup, in which a tag might be <emphasis>. Such a markup denotes the document function, and it could be interpreted as reverse video on a computer screen, underlining by a typewriter, or italics in typeset text.
SGML is used to specify DTDs (document type definitions). A DTD defines a kind of document, such as a report, by specifying what elements must appear in the document—e.g., <Title>—and by giving rules for the use of document elements, such as that a paragraph may appear within a table entry but a table may not appear within a paragraph. A marked-up text may be analyzed by a parsing program to determine if it conforms to a DTD. Another program may read the markups to prepare an index or to translate the document into PostScript for printing. Yet another might generate large or enhanced type or audio for readers with visual or hearing disabilities.
