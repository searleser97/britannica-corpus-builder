Edsger Dijkstra, in full Edsger Wybe Dijkstra,  (born May 11, 1930, Rotterdam, Neth.—died Aug. 6, 2002, Nuenen), Dutch computer scientist. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Amsterdam while working at Amsterdam’s Mathematical Center (1952–62). He taught at the Technical University of Eindhoven from 1963 to 1973 and at the University of Texas from 1984. He was widely known for his 1959 solution to the shortest-path problem; his algorithm is still used to determine the fastest way between two points, as in the routing of communication networks and in flight planning. His research on the idea of mutual exclusion in communications led him to suggest in 1968 the concept of computer semaphores, which are used in virtually every modern operating system. A letter he wrote in 1968 was extremely influential in the development of structured programming. He received the Turing Award in 1972.
