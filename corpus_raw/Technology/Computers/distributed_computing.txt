Distributed computing,  the coordinated use of many computers disbursed over a wide area to do complex tasks.
Distributed computing is a method that researchers use to solve highly complicated problems without having to use an expensive supercomputer. Much like multiprocessing, which uses two or more processors in one computer to carry out a task, distributed computing uses a large number of computers to split up the computational load. With distributed computing, client programs are first installed onto each computer. The client programs then download files containing portions of the problem to be processed and analyzed. As each file is analyzed, the clients send the calculations to a centralized server that compiles the results. In many cases, the programs run when the computers would otherwise be idle, such as overnight.
Distributed computing has been used for such traditional supercomputer applications as protein sequencing and breaking cryptographic codes. Because the cost of distributed computing is much lower than that of a supercomputer, often with volunteers downloading and running the client programs, it has also been used for projects that have trouble getting large amounts of funding, such as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).
