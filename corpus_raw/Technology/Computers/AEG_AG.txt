AEG AG,  former German electronics and electrical-equipment company. As one of Germany’s leading industrial companies through much of the 19th and 20th centuries, AEG manufactured products for industrial and domestic use.
The company was founded in Berlin in 1883 when the industrialist Emil Rathenau, with financial support from Siemens and Halske, another major German electrical company, founded the Deutsche Edison Gesellschaft für Angewandte Electricität (“German Edison Company for Applied Electricity”). In 1887 the company was renamed the Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), which became largely responsible for installing Germany’s first electric power system. It strung transmission lines and built electric trolley systems across Germany before 1900.
In 1941 AEG acquired Gesellschaft für Elektrische Unternehmungen AG, an electric holding company, thus tightening its grip on the German electrical market. In 1966 Telefunken AG, formerly an AEG subsidiary that manufactured audio and electronics equipment, was integrated into AEG, changing the company name in 1967 to AEG-Telefunken.
In the latter part of the 20th century, AEG-Telefunken faced severe financial problems, which some analysts attributed to the company’s decision to continue making high-priced consumer electronics goods (such as stereos and television sets) long after Telefunken’s prices had been undercut by foreign competitors. Most of the company’s Telefunken operations were sold in 1983, with other portions sold in 1985. The remaining firm, renamed AEG AG in 1985, produced electrical and telecommunications equipment, electronics components, office machines, computers, and home appliances. Swedish appliance manufacturer AB Electrolux acquired the AEG household appliance line in 1994. AEG brand appliances remained part of Electrolux’s consumer durables division into the 21st century.
