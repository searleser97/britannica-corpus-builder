TeX,  a page-description computer programming language developed during 1977–86 by Donald Knuth, a Stanford University professor, to improve the quality of mathematical notation in his books.
Text formatting systems, unlike WYSIWYG (“What You See Is What You Get”) word processors, embed plain text formatting commands in a document, which are then interpreted by the language processor to produce a formatted document for display or printing. TeX marks italic text, for example, as {\it this is italicized}, which is then displayed as this is italicized.
TeX largely replaced earlier text formatting languages. Its powerful and flexible abilities gave an expert precise control over such things as the choice of fonts, layout of tables, mathematical notation, and the inclusion of graphics within a document. It is generally used with the aid of “macro” packages that define simple commands for common operations, such as starting a new paragraph; LaTeX is a widely used package. TeX contains numerous standard “style sheets” for different types of documents, and these may be further adapted by each user. There are also related programs such as BibTeX, which manages bibliographies and has style sheets for all of the common bibliography styles, and versions of TeX for languages with various alphabets.
