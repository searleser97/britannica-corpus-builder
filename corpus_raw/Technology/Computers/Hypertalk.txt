Hypertalk,  a computer programming language designed in 1985 as “programming for the rest of us” by American computer scientist Bill Atkinson for Apple’s Macintosh. Using a simple English-like syntax, Hypertalk enabled anyone to combine text, graphics, and audio quickly into “linked stacks” that could be navigated by clicking with a mouse on standard buttons supplied by the program. Hypertalk was particularly popular among American educators in the 1980s and early ’90s for classroom multimedia presentations. Although Hypertalk had many features of object-oriented programming, Apple did not develop it for other computer platforms and let it languish; as Apple’s market share declined in the 1990s, a new cross-platform way of displaying multimedia left Hypertalk all but obsolete.
