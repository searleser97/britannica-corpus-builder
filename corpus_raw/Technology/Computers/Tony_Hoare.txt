Tony Hoare, in full Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare,  (born January 11, 1934, Colombo, Sri Lanka), British computer scientist and winner of the 1980 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for “his fundamental contributions to the definition and design of programming languages.”
In 1956 Hoare earned a bachelor’s degree in classics from the University of Oxford. Following graduation, he studied Russian during his national service in the Royal Navy (1956–58) and then took some graduate-level courses in statistics and computer programming at Oxford. In 1959 Hoare moved to Russia for graduate work in probability theory and computer translation of human languages at Moscow State University. At that time, Hoare devised Quicksort, a computer algorithm for efficiently looking up information in computer tables.
Hoare returned to England in 1960 and joined Elliot Brothers, Ltd., a computer manufacturer, where he worked on programming languages, especially the development of a compiler for a version of ALGOL. In 1968 Hoare accepted a professorship in computer science at Queen’s University of Belfast. He returned to Oxford as a computer science professor in 1977. Following his retirement from Oxford in 1999, Hoare became a senior researcher at Microsoft Research, a division of the Microsoft Corporation, in Cambridge, England.
In addition to numerous papers, Hoare’s published works included Communicating Sequential Processes (1985); Mathematical Logic and Programming Languages (1985), with John C. Shepherdson; Essays in Computing Science (1989), with Clifford B. Jones; and Developments in Concurrency and Communication (1991). In addition to the Turing Award, Hoare received the Faraday Medal (1985), the Kyoto Prize (2000), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ John von Neumann Medal (2011). He was knighted by Elizabeth II in 2000 for his contributions to computer science.
