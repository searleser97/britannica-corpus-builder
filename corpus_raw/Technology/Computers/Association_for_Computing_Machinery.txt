Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),  international organization for computer science and information technology professionals and, since 1960, institutions associated with the field. Since 1966 ACM has annually presented one or more individuals with the A.M. Turing Award, the most prestigious award in computer science, which was established to honour the memory of British mathematician and computer pioneer Alan M. Turing. The Intel Corporation began funding the Turing Award in 2002, and in 2007 Google Inc. joined in funding the award. The prize money was raised to $250,000 that year.
The Eastern Association for Computing Machinery was founded in 1947 at Columbia University in New York City. Eastern was dropped from the organizationâ€™s name in 1948. ACM is headquartered in New York City and maintains an office in Beijing.
ACM sponsors various conferences and hosts several special-interest groups (SIGs). In particular, ACM holds more than 100 SIG meetings each year at various locations around the world. In addition, ACM produces more than 40 publications: print publications include Communications of the ACM, ACM Queue, MemberNet, Crossroads, and netWorker; and Web-only publications include ACM Computers in Entertainment, ACM TechNews, ACM CareerNews, Ubiquity, and eLearn.
