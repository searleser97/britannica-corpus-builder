computer art,  manipulation of computer-generated images (pictures, designs, scenery, portraits, etc.) as part of a purposeful creative process. Specialized software is used together with interactive devices such as digital cameras, optical scanners, styli, and electronic tablets. Because graphic images require large programs, the computers used in such work are generally among the fastest and most powerful available. Computer art has wide applications in advertising, publishing, and film.
