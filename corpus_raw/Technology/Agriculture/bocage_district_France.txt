Bocage,  in western France (e.g., Bocage Normand, Bocage Vend√©en), a well-wooded district in distinction to the campagne, which denotes a hedgeless tract of farmland characteristic of old-established areas of open-field agriculture. The fields of bocage country are small, irregular, and enclosed by hedges and groves of trees. In certain areas, hedges and trees have been cut down and related embankments removed to modernize agriculture and facilitate the regrouping of farm holdings. Problems, including soil erosion, have sometimes resulted from such action.
