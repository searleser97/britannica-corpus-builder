Charles Goodnight,  (born March 5, 1836, Macoupin County, Ill., U.S.—died  Dec. 12, 1929), American cattleman, who helped bring law and order to the Texas Panhandle.
Goodnight’s mother and stepfather brought him to Texas in 1846. He became a cattleman in 1856, then a Texas Ranger (1861?) and an Indian fighter, and finally a rancher and cattle driver, laying out a cattle trail from Belknap, Texas, to Fort Sumner, N.Mex., with an extension to Wyoming called the Goodnight–Loving Trail (the latter name was sometimes applied to the whole trail from Belknap).
Goodnight had ranches successively in New Mexico, Colorado, and the Panhandle of Texas, finally (from 1877) developing with a partner, John G. Adair, the great JA Ranch of nearly 1,000,000 acres containing some 100,000 cattle. He helped organize the first Panhandle stockman’s association (1880), which introduced purebred cattle, policed trails, and fought cattle thieves and outlaws. He semiretired in 1890 to a small ranch at Goodnight, Tex.
