Wilbur Olin Atwater,  (born May 3, 1844, Johnsburg, New York, U.S.—died September 22, 1907, Middletown, Connecticut), American scientist who developed agricultural chemistry and nutrition science.
Upon completing his undergraduate work at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, in 1865, Atwater continued his education at Yale University, where his thesis on corn (maize) discussed for the first time how chemical techniques could be applied to food. He graduated with a Ph.D. in agricultural chemistry in 1869 and then travelled to Germany for two years to further his studies. Returning to the U.S, he was briefly employed at East Tennessee University (later the University of Tennessee at Knoxville) and at the Maine State College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts (later the University of Maine) before he began to teach at Wesleyan in 1873, where he was professor of chemistry for the rest of his life. In 1875 he was instrumental in persuading the Connecticut legislature to set up the first state agricultural research station in the United States, at Middletown. In 1887, again at his prodding, Congress passed the Hatch Act, providing funds for agricultural experiment stations in all states. He was the first director of the Office of Experiment Stations (1888–91).
He then turned his attention to calorimetry and, with E.B. Rosa, professor of physics at Wesleyan, constructed the Atwater-Rosa calorimeter (1892–97), which proved the law of conservation of energy in human beings and made it possible to calculate the caloric values of different foods. The system for determing caloric values that Atwater devised in 1896 continues to be used throughout the world.
