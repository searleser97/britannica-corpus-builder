Herdbook,   official record of individuals and pedigrees of a recognized breed of livestock, especially cattle or swine. When development of purebred livestock for use in breeding began in Britain in the 18th century, it became necessary to maintain a pedigree of each animal. Records of new breeds were at first maintained by designated individuals, but eventually breeding associations were formed to control and maintain registration. In modern livestock trading, the ancestral record of an individual animal is a major determinant of its market value.
