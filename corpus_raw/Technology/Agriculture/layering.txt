Layering, orlayerage,  Method of propagation in which plants are induced to regenerate missing parts from parts that are still attached to the parent plant. It occurs naturally for drooping black raspberry or forsythia stems, whose trailing tips root where they come in contact with the soil. They then send up new shoots from the newly rooted portion of the plant. For soil layering, lower stems are bent to the ground and covered with moist soil of good quality. For air layering, a branch is deeply slit and the wound is covered with a ball of earth or moss and kept moist until roots develop; the branch is then severed and transplanted. Layering was practiced by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. See also cutting.
