agronomy,  branch of agriculture that deals with field crop production and soil management. Agronomists generally work with crops that are grown on a large scale (e.g., small grains) and that require relatively little management. Agronomic experiments focus on a variety of factors relating to crop plants, including yield, diseases, cultivation, pest and weed management, and sensitivity to factors such as climate and soil. Agronomists may specialize in plant breeding and biotechnology to improve crops. Many agronomists also utilize ecological principles to conserve and protect the environment from the negative effects of agriculture, a field known as agroecology.
