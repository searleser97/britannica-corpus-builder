American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF),   largest farmers’ organization in the United States. The AFBF, founded in 1919, is an independent nongovernmental federation of farm bureaus from all 50 states and Puerto Rico.
The AFBF was an outgrowth of the county farm bureau movement, which started shortly before World War I. Various farming communities began to adopt the use of county demonstration agents, agricultural experts, or extension workers to provide farmers with the results of scientific study, and in many localities these agents were supported by local groups of farmers who constituted county committees or bureaus. Before the end of the war, the county farm bureaus in several states had formed state organizations, and in November 1919 representatives of the state farm bureaus met in Chicago and organized the AFBF.
The federation quickly became active in sponsoring a wide variety of political measures. In the 1930s it took a major part in formulating and obtaining passage of the Agricultural Adjustment Acts of 1933 and 1938. During World War II it opposed price controls. Later, it advocated measures to reduce government farm price supports and return the direction of the farm economy more largely to commercial markets. In general, the federation tended to favour agribusiness, while still maintaining the allegiance of many small farmers. The AFBF is opposed to environmental regulations that may infringe on farmers’ private property rights and has fought the Environmental Protection Agency on a number of issues.
As of 2011, AFBF membership numbered more than six million families. The federation holds annual conventions.
