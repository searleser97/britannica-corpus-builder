Nursery,  place where plants are grown for transplanting, for use as stock for budding and grafting, or for sale. Commercial nurseries produce and distribute woody and herbaceous plants, including ornamental trees, shrubs, and bulb crops. While most nursery-grown plants are ornamental, the nursery business also includes fruit plants and certain perennial vegetables used in home gardens (e.g., asparagus, rhubarb). Some nurseries are kept for the propagation of native plants for ecological restoration. Greenhouses may be used for tender plants or to keep production going year round, but nurseries most commonly consist of shaded or exposed areas outside. Plants are commonly cultivated from seed or from cuttings and are often grown in pots or other temporary containers. See also floriculture.
