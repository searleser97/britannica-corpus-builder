Toxaphene,   a dense, yellowish, semisolid mixture of organic compounds made by chlorination of camphene (a hydrocarbon obtained from turpentine) and used as an insecticide. Toxaphene, which contains 67â€“69 percent chlorine, is insoluble in water but highly soluble in several organic solvents; under the influence of light, heat, or strong alkalies, it decomposes, forming hydrogen chloride and losing its toxicity to insects.
Strobane, a straw-coloured liquid made by the reaction of chlorine with a mixture of camphene and pinene, is an insecticide similar to toxaphene. Both are toxic to a wide variety of insects and are used in combating pests that attack cotton and other field crops.
