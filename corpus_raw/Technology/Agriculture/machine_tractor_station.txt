Machine-tractor station, Russian mashinno-traktornaya stantsiya (MTS),  in the Soviet Union, state-owned institution that rented heavy agricultural machinery (e.g., tractors and combines) to a group of neighbouring kolkhozy (collective farms) and supplied skilled personnel to operate and repair the equipment. The stations, which became widespread and prominent during the collectivization drive in the early 1930s, were instrumental in the mechanization of Soviet agriculture. 
The MTS were paid in kind for their services by the kolkhozy and thereby also functioned as major agencies for grain procurement for the state. In addition, they were the chief instrument used by the Communist Party to control the countryside. The MTS’ political departments were given absolute control of the farms and continued to have great local political influence until they were abolished in 1953. But in exercising their influence they frequently caused confusion by rivaling the authority of the district party organizations, and they often conflicted with the kolkhoz management, which controlled the labour.
In 1958, as part of a major agricultural reform, the MTS were abolished and their equipment was sold to the kolkhozy. Some of the stations were transformed into Repair and Technical Service Stations (Remontno-tekhnicheskie stantsii; RTS), which repaired the machinery, supplied spare parts, and continued to rent machines for special purposes—e.g., road building. In 1961 the RTS were replaced by the All-Union Farm Machinery Association (Soyuzselkhoztekhnika).
