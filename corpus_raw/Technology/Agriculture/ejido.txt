Ejido,   in Mexico, village lands communally held in the traditional Indian system of land tenure that combines communal ownership with individual use. The ejido consists of cultivated land, pastureland, other uncultivated lands, and the fundo legal (townsite). In most cases the cultivated land is divided into separate family holdings, which cannot be sold although they can be handed down to heirs.
Measures taken during the reform period that began in 1855 abolished the landownership rights of civil and religious corporations. Although the primary purpose of this reform was to dissolve the large ecclesiastical estates, the law also forced the Indians to give up their village lands. The land reform measures in the 1917 constitution restored land that had been taken from ejidos, made land grants to landless villages, and divided large estates into smaller private land holdings. Today ejidos constitute some 55 percent of Mexicoâ€™s cultivated land.
The increasing fragmentation of the land caused by the family inheritance pattern has in some cases resulted in an inefficient scale of operation. This result, together with a lack of capital and limited educational attainment, has retarded progress in ejido agriculture. Some cooperatively run ejidos, however, particularly in the cotton-raising areas, have shown great success.
