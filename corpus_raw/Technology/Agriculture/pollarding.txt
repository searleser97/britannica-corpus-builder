Pollarding,   cutting of top tree branches back to the trunk, leaving club-headed stems that grow a thick head of new branches. The purpose in some areas is to limit the area of top growth or to create an annual harvest of boughs for basket weaving, securing thatch, and the like. In cities such as London it is done to prevent branches from tangling with overhead wires and from overhanging streets and to promote growth of a denser foliage.
