food processor,  electric appliance developed in the late 20th century, used for a variety of food-preparation functions including kneading, chopping, blending, and pulverizing.
The food processor was invented by Pierre Verdon, whose Le Magi-Mix, a compact household version of his own earlier restaurant-scaled Robot-Coupe, was first exhibited in Paris in 1971. Carl Sontheimer, an American engineer and inventor, refined Verdonâ€™s machines to produce the Cuisinart. The widespread success of the Cuisinart following its exhibition in Chicago in 1973 led a number of other manufacturers to design competing models, and hundreds of thousands of food processors were sold in the late 1970s.
Food processors are of two basic types: those in which most of the work is done in a single bowl by a flat blade, and those fitted with many attachments. Standard accessories include a work bowl, lid, chopping blade, mixing blade, and disks for slicing and shredding.
