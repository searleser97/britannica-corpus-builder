Till-less agriculture, also called No-till Agriculture,  cultivation technique in which the soil is disturbed only along the slit or in the hole into which the seeds are planted; reserved detritus from previous crops covers and protects the seedbed. The practice is one of several primitive farming methods that have been revived as conservation measures in the 20th century.
Unlike conventional tillage, which controls weed growth by plowing and cultivating, till-less agriculture uses large quantities of selective herbicides to kill weeds and the remains of the previous crop. The vegetation detritus protects seedlings when they are most vulnerable to the ravages of nature, but it also lowers the soil surface temperature and limits the practicality of using the till-less system in some areas to warmer regions or to plant varieties suited to cooler seedling-growing conditions.
A primary benefit of the protection and minimal disturbance of topsoil is a decreased rate of soil erosion. The till-less technique reduces equipment, fuel, and fertilizer needs and, significantly, the time required for tending crops. The method improves soil-aggregate formation, microbial activity in the soil, and water infiltration and storage, while enabling cultivation on slopes of up to 15 percent. Crops suited to the technique include corn (maize), pigeon pea, cowpea, and soybean. Some resistance to till-less agriculture and its variations has come from machinery manufacturers and from farmers themselves, to many of whom the debris-laden fields required by the procedure connote inferior farming.
