Corn harvester,   machine designed for harvesting corn and preparing it for storage. The earliest corn-harvesting devices, such as the horse-drawn sled cutter, severed the stalk at the ground. Binding of the stalks into shocks for drying, as well as the subsequent picking, husking, and shelling, were all done by hand. The mechanical binder was invented about 1850. At about the same time, a rudimentary mechanical picker was developed, though it took nearly 30 years for a practical version to appear.
The mechanical picker snaps the ears from the stalk so that only the grain and cobs are harvested. The standing stalks are guided by shields or snouts to pass between counter-rotating rollers that pull the stalks down and through very sharply, snapping the ears free. The husking mechanism, consisting of closely spaced, counter-rotating rollers, tears the husks away. Pickers may be pulled behind a tractor and power-takeoff driven or mounted directly on the tractor, one unit on each side, to form a two-row harvester.
Field shelling attachments for mechanical pickers were introduced in the 1950s. In the late 20th century, corn-harvesting attachments for the combine were in widespread use.
