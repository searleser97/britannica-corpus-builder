Sir George Stapledon,  (born September 22, 1882, Northam, Devon, England—died September 16, 1960, Bath, Somerset), British agriculturalist and pioneer in the development of grassland science.
Stapledon graduated in 1904 from the University of Cambridge and returned there in 1906 to begin a study of plant sciences. In 1910 he was appointed to the staff of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. In 1912 he went to the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth, where he became an advisory officer in agricultural botany. Stapledon’s attempts to devise techniques for separating weed seeds from commercial seeds during World War I led to the establishment of the Seed Testing Station in London. In 1919 he returned to the University College of Wales and served as director of the Welsh Plant Breeding Station until 1942. While there he developed and improved strains of oats, clovers, and other grasses.
Stapledon next established a second agricultural station, at Drayton, Warwickshire, that was devoted entirely to the improvement of grassland areas in Great Britain. He remained there until his retirement in 1946. On the basis of Stapledon’s improvements, the government established the Grassland Research Station at Hurley, Berkshire.
In 1939 Stapledon was knighted and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
