Brooder house,  in agriculture, heated enclosure to provide shelter for young livestock and poultry.
Chick brooders, also called broiler houses, are typically wood-framed, wood-floored, movable structures heated by electric or oil-fired stoves and built on skids. The chicks are housed until they are about six weeks old, when they no longer need heat. Commercial brooder houses may be very large, having several brooder units, underfloor heat or heat lamps, fan ventilation, automatic waterers and feeders, and large doors through which tractors and litter-removing equipment can pass.
