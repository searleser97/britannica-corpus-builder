Cutting,  In botany, a plant section originating from the stem, leaf, or root and capable of developing into a new plant. The cutting is usually placed in warm, moist sand. Many plants, especially horticultural and garden varieties, are propagated through cuttings; by the use of new techniques, many other plants formerly not susceptible to propagation through cuttings have more successfully reproduced. The plants that develop from cuttings are clones. See also graft, layering.
