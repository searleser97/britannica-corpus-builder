Silo,   in agriculture, airtight structure that encloses and protects silage (q.v.; partially fermented fodder, called haylage if made from grass), keeping it in the succulent and slightly sour condition edible for farm animals.
A common type silo is an upright cylindrical tower 10 to 18 feet (3 to 5 metres) in diameter and 30 to 50 feet in height, made of steel with a fused-glass or porcelain inner surface for corrosion resistance. Silos may also be constructed of other metals, masonry, or wood; they may also be horizontal pits, trenches (trench silo), or stacks above or below the ground. The structure may be sealed with earth, canvas, heavy paper, or plastic to keep air out. Silage may be unloaded from the bottom with a power-operated unloader and must be removed at a certain rate per day to prevent spoilage.
