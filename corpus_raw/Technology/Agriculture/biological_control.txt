Biological control,  the use of living organisms to control pests. A natural enemy such as a parasite, predator, or disease organism is introduced into the environment of a pest or, if already present, is encouraged to multiply and become more effective in reducing the number of pest organisms. Examples of biological control include the destruction of the citrophilus mealybug in California by two parasitic species of chalcid wasps imported from Australia, Coccophagus gurneyi and Tetracnemus pretiosus; the effective predation of an Australian ladybird beetle, or vedalia beetle (Rodolia cardinalis), on the cottony cushion scale in California; the limiting of the proliferation of the European rabbit in Australia by introduction of myxoma virus (which causes the disease myxomatosis); the control of Japanese beetles by Bacillus popilliae, which causes milky disease; and the control of various larvae that attack food crops in home gardens by Bacillus thuringiensis, a soil-dwelling bacterium.
While biological control can be an effective and environmentally sound means of controlling pests, some strategies have led to the introduction of invasive species into novel habitats, such as the venomous cane toads (Bufo marinus) introduced in Australia in the 1930s from Hawaii to reduce the effects of beetles on sugarcane plantations. Cane toads have been responsible for a variety of ills, such as population declines in native prey species (bees and other small animals), population drops in amphibian species that compete with them, and the poisoning of species that consume them. Any new methods of biological control must be carefully considered before organisms are released into the environment.
