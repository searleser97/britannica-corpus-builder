Francisco de Paula Marín, byname Manini,  (born 1774, Jerez, Spain—died  Oct. 30, 1837, Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands [U.S.]), horticultural experimenter who introduced numerous plant species to the Hawaiian Islands.
Marín acquired his horticultural knowledge as a youth working in the Andalusian vineyards of Spain. He was taken to California and then to the Hawaiian Islands, then known as the Sandwich Islands, sometime between 1791 and 1794, after having been shanghaied, according to his own account, from the port of San Francisco.
The Spaniard was befriended by King Kamehameha I, who gave Marín land for his agricultural experiments. Marín also served as Kamehameha’s interpreter, and, as the king aged, the Spaniard assumed many government duties. He began to experiment with island herbs and developed a wealth of pharmacological lore. From Spanish colonies all over the world, Marín requested and received foreign seeds and plants and devised the best means, time, and soil type in which to plant them. Peaches, oranges, olives, and others arrived; in exchange, Marín sent coconuts. Much of the diversity of Hawaii’s island flora today is due to Marín’s careful studies. He became known for his flourishing gardens and vineyards and also for his reluctance to bestow his bountiful crops on friends and acquaintances. The Hawaiian corruption of his name, “Manini,” has become a slang word in the modern island vocabulary, meaning miserly.
