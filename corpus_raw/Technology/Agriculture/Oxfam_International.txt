Oxfam International, Oxfam abbreviation of Oxford Committee for Famine Relief,  privately funded international organization that provides relief and development aid to impoverished or disaster-stricken communities worldwide. The original Oxfam was founded at Oxford, England, in 1942 to raise funds for the feeding of hungry children in war-torn Greece. It is now a federation of 17 organizations (Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Quebec, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States).
The organization grew as it provided aid to refugees in the years following World War II. Its aid emphasis shifted in the 1960s to helping improve agriculture and food production in the more impoverished countries of the world. Oxfam developed an overseas network of field directors to administer its aid projects, but its goal was to provide manpower and training funds so that indigenous peoples could learn to help themselves. A large network of British volunteers helped raise local funds for such projects. During the 1970s affiliate Oxfam organizations were formed in several countries. Oxfam organizations continued to provide emergency aid for areas stricken by droughts, floods, earthquakes, and other natural catastrophes. Oxfam urges global solutions to poverty and economic inequalities.
