Ever-normal granaries,  Price-stabilizing granaries first established in the 1st century bc. Under the Qing dynasty they were set up by all Chinese provinces in each county to keep grain on hand to offset regional food shortages in years of crop failure. By keeping the supply of grain stable (“ever normal”), the granaries stabilized prices, and even undeveloped regions of the country were protected from famine.
