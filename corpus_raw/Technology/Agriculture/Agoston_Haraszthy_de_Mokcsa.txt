Agoston Haraszthy de Mokcsa,  (born c. 1812, Futtak, Hungary, Austrian Empireâ€”died  July 6, 1869, Hacienda San Antonio, near Corinto, Nicaragua), Hungarian-born pioneer who introduced viticulture (grape cultivation) into California.
The son of a landowner, Haraszthy immigrated to the United States in 1840. He went to the upper Midwest and founded what is now Sauk City, Wis. In 1849 he journeyed with his family to San Diego, Calif., where he served as a county sheriff and was elected a member of the state legislature. In 1852 he began importing and planting grapevines, and in 1858 he planted the first large vineyard in California, in the Sonoma Valley near Buena Vista. In 1861 the California legislature commissioned him to report on ways of improving and expanding grape cultivation in the state, and Haraszthy thus visited grape-producing regions in Europe, returning with about 300 different varieties of vines to be planted in California. Haraszthy lost all his landholdings in 1866, after which he went to Nicaragua and bought a large tract of farmland upon which to grow sugarcane.
