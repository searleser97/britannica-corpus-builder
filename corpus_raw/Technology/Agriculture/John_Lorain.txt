John Lorain,  (born 1753, Maryland [U.S.]—died  1823, Philipsburg, Pa., U.S.), American farmer, merchant, agricultural writer, and the first person to create a hybrid by combining two types of corn. His experiments anticipated the methods employed in the century following his death.
Lorain was born in the North American colony of Maryland. After managing a farm there for many years, he moved in 1795 to Germantown, Pa. From 1810 to 1813 he contributed articles to the journal of the Philadelphia Society for the Promotion of Agriculture; in 1812 he described his experiments—the earliest known—on crossing flint corn and gourd seed corn to form a hybrid with higher productivity than either parent. In 1812 he moved to Philipsburg, Pa., where, in addition to farming, he kept a store and served as postmaster and justice of the peace. In 1825 Lorain’s widow published his book Nature and Reason Harmonized in the Practice of Husbandry, which contains detailed descriptions of his experiments with hybrids and his attempts to combine the best qualities of different corns into one strain.
