André Parmentier, English Andrew Parmentier,  (born July 3, 1780, Enghien, Austrian Netherlands—died  Nov. 26, 1830), Belgian-born American horticulturist, responsible for exhibiting many plant species in America.
Parmentier was the son of a linen merchant and was educated at the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain). His brothers were all horticulturists, the eldest being director of the Duc d’Arenberg’s park at Enghien. In 1824 André lost his capital in speculation and immigrated to New York, where he established a commercial nursery and botanical garden. He imported plants and contributed to horticultural journals. Although he designed and laid out grounds, it is as a plantsman that he is remembered.
