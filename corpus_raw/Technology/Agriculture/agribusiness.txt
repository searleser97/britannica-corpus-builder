Agribusiness,   agriculture regarded as a business; more specifically, that part of a modern national economy devoted to the production, processing, and distribution of food and fibre products and by-products.
In highly industrialized countries, many activities essential to agriculture are carried on separately from the farm. These include the development and production of equipment, fertilizers, and seeds; in some countries the processing, storage, preservation, and delivery of products have also been separated from basic farming. In consequence, farming itself has become increasingly specialized and businesslike. Some business firms even raise crops, as in the case of a winery that operates its own vineyards or a large commercial producer of fast-frozen or canned vegetables that maintains its own farm. Many of these farms use extensive mechanization and computer technology to increase production.
In recent years, conglomerate companies that are involved in nonagricultural businesses have entered agribusiness by buying and operating large farms. Some food-processing firms that operate farms have begun to market fresh produce under their brand names.
