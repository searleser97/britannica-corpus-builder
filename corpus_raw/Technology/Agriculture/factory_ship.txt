Factory ship, also called Mother Ship,  originally, a large ship used in whaling, but now, more broadly, any ship that is equipped to process marine catches for various consumer uses. It most commonly serves as the main ship in a fleet sent to waters a great distance from home port to catch, prepare, and store fish or whales for market.
The present-day factory ship is an automated, greatly enlarged version of the early whaler that sailed into remote waters and processed only whale oil onboard, discarding the carcass. More modern ships converted the entire whale into usable products. The efficiency of these ships and the increasingly effective methods that were used to hunt whales threatened a number of whale species with extinction and necessitated moratoriums on the hunting of most species. This led to a precipitous decline in the use of factory ships for whaling, but their use for fishing has grown dramatically. Such countries as Russia and Japan maintain extensive fishing fleets centred on factory ships.
