Reaper,   any farm machine that cuts grain. Early reapers simply cut the crop and dropped it unbound, but modern machines include harvesters, combines, and binders, which also perform other harvesting operations. A patent for a reaper was issued in England to Joseph Boyce in 1800. In the 1830s Jeremiah Bailey of the United States patented a mower-reaper, and Obed Hussey and Cyrus McCormick developed reapers with guards and reciprocating (back-and-forth-moving) cutting blades. Hussey was the first to obtain a patent (1833), but McCormickâ€™s reaper had the advantages of a divider to separate cut and standing grain and a revolving reel to topple the cut grain onto the rear of the machine, where it could be raked off onto the ground and later tied. C.W. and W.W. Marsh patented the forerunner of the first successful harvester in 1858. Their machine swept the cut grain onto a canvas conveyor that carried it to a box for binding, but it had no mechanical binding device. See also binder; combine.
