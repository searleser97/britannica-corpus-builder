Joseph Arch,  (born Nov. 10, 1826, Barford, Warwickshire, Eng.—died  Feb. 12, 1919, Barford), organizer who became the leader of England’s agricultural labourers.
The son and grandson of farm labourers, Arch used his training as a Primitive Methodist preacher to good effect in the early 1870s when farm labourers in the south and central areas of England began to protest against low wages and harsh living conditions. Arch founded the National Agricultural Labourers’ Union in 1872 and served as its president until it was dissolved in 1896.
When membership in the union began to decline after 1874, Arch began to turn his attention to politics and in 1885 served the first of several terms as a member of Parliament (1885–86, 1892–1900). He also served on the Warwickshire County Council from 1889 to 1892. His political skills were put to use on behalf of farm workers, for Arch is credited with having played an instrumental part in obtaining the vote for them in the Reform Act of 1884–85.
