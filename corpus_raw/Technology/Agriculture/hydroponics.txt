Hydroponics, also called aquaculture, nutriculture, soilless culture, or tank farming,  the cultivation of plants in nutrient-enriched water, with or without the mechanical support of an inert medium such as sand or gravel.
Plants have long been grown with their roots immersed in solutions of water and fertilizer for scientific studies of their nutrition. Early commercial hydroponics (from Greek hydro, “water,” and ponos, “labour”) adopted this method of culture. Because of the difficulties in supporting the plants in a normal upright growing position and aerating the solution, however, this method was supplanted by gravel culture, in which gravel supports the plants in a watertight bed or bench. Various kinds of gravel and other materials have been used successfully, including fused shale and clay and granite chips. Fertilizer solution is pumped through periodically, the frequency and concentration depending on the plant and on ambient conditions such as light and temperature. The solution drains into a tank, and pumping is usually automatic.
The solution is composed of different fertilizer-grade chemical compounds containing varying amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium—the major elements necessary for plant growth—and various trace, or minor, elements such as sulfur, magnesium, and calcium. The solution can be used indefinitely; periodic tests indicate the need for additional chemicals or water. The chemical ingredients usually may be mixed dry and stored. As the plants grow, concentration of the solution and frequency of pumping are increased.
A wide variety of vegetables and florist crops can be grown satisfactorily in gravel. The principal advantage is the saving of labour by automatic watering and fertilizing. The disadvantages are high installation costs and the need to test the solution frequently. Yields are about the same as for soil-grown crops.
