Seagram Company Ltd.,  former Canadian corporation that was the world’s largest producer and distributor of distilled spirits.
The company began when Distillers Corp., Ltd., a Montreal distillery owned by Samuel Bronfman, acquired Joseph E. Seagram & Sons in 1928. The new company, named Distillers Corporation-Seagrams Ltd., grew rapidly during the later years of the Prohibition era and in the 1930s. By the 1940s the firm had become the largest distiller in both Canada and the United States. Under the leadership of the founder’s son, Edgar M. Bronfman, who became head of the company in 1971, the firm diversified during the 1950s and ’60s from its original base of blended whiskies into the production and marketing of Scotch, bourbon, rum, vodka, gin, and many different wines. It also expanded into the European, Latin American, East Asian, and African markets. Edgar M. Bronfman, Jr., succeeded his father in 1989 and began selling the company’s liquor businesses to competitors while purchasing entertainment companies such as MCA (including Universal Pictures) and Polygram NV. Seagram merged with French media companies Canal Plus and Vivendi in 2000. By 2002 all of Seagram’s assets had been acquired by other companies.
