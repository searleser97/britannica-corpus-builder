systems analysis,  in information processing, a phase of systems engineering. The principal objective of the systems analysis phase is the specification of what the system needs to do to meet the requirements of end users. In the systems design phase, such specifications are converted to a hierarchy of charts that define the data required and the processes to be carried out on the data so they can be expressed as instructions of a computer program. Many information systems are implemented with generic software, rather than with such custom-built programs.
