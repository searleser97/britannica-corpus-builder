Jamming,   in electronics, broadcasting a strong signal that overrides or obscures a target signal. Jamming of radio and television stations broadcasting from beyond borders may be carried out by a country that does not wish its citizens to receive programs from abroad. In military activities, jamming is frequently employed to confuse enemy radar or communications. The techniques of jamming are many and varied, but most of them simply consist of broadcasting a powerful radio signal, modulated with noise, on the precise frequency of the signal being jammed.
