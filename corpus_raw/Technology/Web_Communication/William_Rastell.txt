William Rastell,  (born 1508, Coventry, Warwickshire, Eng.—died  Aug. 27, 1565, Leuven, duchy of Brabant [now in Belgium]), English printer, lawyer, and man of letters. He edited and published the works of his uncle, Thomas More. He also printed the only surviving plays of John Heywood, who married Rastell’s sister, Eliza.
The son of John Rastell, a playwright and, like him, a lawyer and printer, he went to Oxford in 1525 but received no degree. He worked in his father’s office as a scribe and printer and then set up his own press in 1529. After More’s execution in 1535 Rastell and More’s daughter, Margaret Roper, rescued the manuscript letters and treatises that More had written in the Tower of London.
Rastell began the study of law at Lincoln’s Inn in 1532 and was called to the bar in 1539, rising to the position of treasurer at the Inn in 1549. In that year the Protestant policies of Edward VI caused Rastell, a staunch Catholic, to go into exile at Leuven. He returned after the accession of Queen Mary (July 1553) and in 1557 had More’s English Works printed. He also published important law books of his own: A Collection of All the Statutes (1557) and A Collection of Entrees (1566). Of his large biography of More, only a fragment survives. In 1558 he became a justice of the queen’s bench, and five years later, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, he went into exile again at Leuven, where he published More’s Latin works in 1565.
