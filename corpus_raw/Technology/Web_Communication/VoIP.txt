VoIP, in full Voice over Internet Protocol, also calledIP telephony,  communications technology for carrying voice telephone traffic over a data network such as the Internet. VoIP uses the Internet Protocol (IP)â€”one half of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), a global addressing system for sending and receiving packets of data over the Internet.
VoIP works by converting sound into a digital signal, which is then sent over a data network such as the Internet. The conversion is done by a device, such as a personal computer (PC) or special VoIP phone, that has a high-speed, or broadband, Internet connection. The digital signal is routed through the network to its destination, where a second VoIP device converts the signal back to sound. Because of the digital nature of VoIP, call quality is normally much higher than that of a standard telephone. Another advantage is that VoIP frequently costs less than standard telephone and long-distance service.
Initially, there were problems with VoIP, not the least of which was how VoIP connected to 911 emergency systems. Because of this, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required VoIP providers to provide connections to 911, although these systems sometimes worked differently from conventional 911 systems. Another, more persistent, problem that sometimes arises is that VoIP systems will often not work during a power outage.
Several companies provide VoIP service that allow people to use their PC or a special phone with the service. Larger organizations sometimes handle their own VoIP traffic.
