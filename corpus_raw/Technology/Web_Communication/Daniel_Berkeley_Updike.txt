Daniel Berkeley Updike,  (born Feb. 24, 1860, Providence, R.I., U.S.—died  Dec. 28, 1941, Boston, Mass.), American printer and scholar, founder in 1893 of the distinguished Merrymount Press in Boston.
Between 1880 and 1893 Updike worked for the publisher Houghton Mifflin and from 1892 was at that company’s Riverside Press. He then started his own commercial venture and published the Humanist Library, a series produced in a Renaissance style, in the early part of the 20th century. Selling books did not please Updike, however, and he dropped that portion of his business and concentrated on manufacturing books for others. Merrymount Press soon acquired a reputation for its superior designs and excellent printing, and trade publishers and book clubs became customers.
Updike’s book designs combine the functional and the beautiful. They are noteworthy for their clarity of organization, easy readability, and excellent workmanship, based upon the use of a few carefully selected typefaces and immaculate presswork. His masterpieces are a complex folio edition of The Book of Common Prayer (1930) and an edition of Izaak Walton’s The Compleat Angler (1928). He taught printing history at the Harvard Business School, and his Printing Types: Their History, Forms, and Use (1922) became an authoritative text.
