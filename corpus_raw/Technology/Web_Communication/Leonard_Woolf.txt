Leonard Woolf, in full Leonard Sidney Woolf,  (born Nov. 25, 1880, London—died  Aug. 14, 1969, Rodmell, Sussex, Eng.), British man of letters, publisher, political worker, journalist, and internationalist who influenced literary and political life and thought more by his personality than by any one achievement.
Woolf’s most enduring accomplishment was probably his autobiography, an expression of the toughness of moral fibre and quality of mind and spirit that made him one of the outstanding men of his time. Its first three volumes, Sowing (1960), Growing (1961), and Beginning Again (1964), re-create the world of liberal Jewry into which he was born, the intellectual excitement of life at the University of Cambridge in the early years of the 20th century, the experience as a civil servant in Ceylon (1904–11) that made him an anti-imperialist, and the atmosphere of the Bloomsbury group of artists and writers, in which he and his wife, novelist Virginia Woolf, played a formative part. In 1917 they founded their own publishing house, the Hogarth Press, and their discerning understanding encouraged such writers as T.S. Eliot and E.M. Forster.
The last volumes of the autobiography (Downhill All the Way, 1967; The Journey Not the Arrival Matters, 1969) span the years 1919 to 1969, a period during which Woolf exercised a certain amount of political influence through editorial activity on left-wing and internationalist journals and through his writings. His work helped to lay the foundations of the policy of the League of Nations and the United Nations and of the welfare state.
