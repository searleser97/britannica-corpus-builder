Domain name,  Address of a computer, organization, or other entity on a TCP/IP network such as the Internet. Domain names are typically in a three-level “server.organization.type” format. The top level, called the top-level domain, has usually denoted the type of organization, such as “com” (for commercial sites) or “edu” (for educational sites). However, in 2011 the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced that it would greatly increase the number of top-level domains by allowing nearly any new top-level domain name in any language. The second level is the top level plus the name of the organization (e.g., “britannica.com” for Encyclopædia Britannica). The third level identifies a specific host server at the address, such as the “www” (World Wide Web) host server for “www.britannica.com.” A domain name is ultimately mapped to an IP address, but two or more domain names can be mapped to the same IP address. A domain name must be unique on the Internet and must be assigned by a registrar accredited by ICANN. See also URL.
