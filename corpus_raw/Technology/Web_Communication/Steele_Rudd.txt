Steele Rudd, pseudonym of Arthur Hoey Davis,  (born November 14, 1868, Drayton, Queensland, Australia—died October 11, 1935, Brisbane, Queensland), novelist, playwright, and short-story writer whose comic characters are a well-known part of Australia’s literary heritage.
Son of a blacksmith, Rudd worked as a horsebreaker, stockman, and drover before going to Brisbane, where he became a clerk and began to write poems and sketches for local journals. His first book was the largely autobiographical On Our Selection (1899), and it was followed by a similar volume, Sandy’s Selection (1904). He later adapted On Our Selection into a successful play that was produced in London; six other dramas followed. In more than 20 volumes Rudd depicted farm life in the Darling Downs area of southern Queensland. His early work was often realistic yet farcically tragic, and he later found popular success in creating caricatures of rustic types. Adapted into comic strips, radio programs, and films, his popular work has retained its hold on the Australian public since his death. In 1904 he founded Steele Rudd’s Magazine, a popular periodical that appeared at irregular intervals over the next 25 years. A champion of Australian writing, he published the work of many unknown writers who later achieved fame.
