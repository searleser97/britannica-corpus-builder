Sir Isaac Shoenberg,  (born March 1, 1880, Pinsk, Russia [now in Belarus]—died  Jan. 25, 1963, London, Eng.), principal inventor of the first high-definition television system, which was used by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for the world’s first public high-definition telecast (from London, 1936).
Before emigrating to England in 1914, Shoenberg had installed the first radio stations in Russia. For the British firm of Electric and Musical Industries (EMI), he headed a research group that developed (1931–35) an advanced kind of camera tube (the Emitron) and a relatively efficient hard-vacuum cathode-ray tube for the television receiver. Until 1964 the BBC adhered to the technical standards he had proposed: 405 scanning lines and 25 flickerless pictures a second. Shoenberg was knighted in 1962. His youngest son, David Shoenberg, became a noted physicist.
