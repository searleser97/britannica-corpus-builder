Google Voice,  telecommunications service introduced in 2009 by the American search engine company Google Inc.
In 2007 Google acquired GrandCentral, a start-up subscription service that offered the promise of “one telephone number to rule them all”—a single number that users could give out to family, friends, and business contacts, together with a system for creating rules to determine which of their telephones (work, home, mobile) would be rung according to the incoming caller’s identity (telephone caller ID or the recipient’s address book). In addition, subscribers could call the system to retrieve voice mail. On March 12, 2009, Google relaunched GrandCentral as Google Voice, a free telecommunications service (initially open only to existing GrandCentral subscribers) that added a text messaging system and the ability to make VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) calls for free between any Internet service providers (ISP) located within the United States. Google Voice could also be used for making international calls, though that service was not free.
In addition to challenging traditional business models for long-distance telephone service, Google Voice competed with eBay’s Skype, another free VoIP service. However, Skype customers needed a computer or a special telephone connected to a computer in order to make any calls, and only domestic calls to other Skype customers were free.
