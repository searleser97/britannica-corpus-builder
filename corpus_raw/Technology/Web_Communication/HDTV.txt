HDTV, in full high-definition television,  a digital broadcasting standard that offers picture and audio superior to that of traditional standard-definition television (SDTV).
By the early 1990s, long-running international development efforts aimed at creating a higher-quality television signal had converged on digital transmission in place of traditional analog radio waves. In 1998 John Glenn, a former astronaut and then U.S. senator, went on a spaceflight with the launch broadcast live in high definition to specially equipped museums, electronics stores, and other locations. By the middle of the next decade, many broadcast networks and cable outlets offered HDTV channels, and HDTV sets were widely available to consumers.
HDTV—broadcast by cable or satellite or over the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) portion of public airwaves at a bandwidth of 6 megahertz (MHz)—offers video resolutions as high as 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (1,920 columns by 1,080 rows), many times greater than that of SDTV. The lowest high-resolution standard is 720p, or 720 progressive scan, for resolutions of 1,280 by 720 in which all the rows are refreshed together in each display cycle (typically 50 or 60 Hz, depending on country, though televisions with faster display cycles have been introduced). The next higher resolution is 1080i, or 1080 interlaced scan, for resolutions of 1,920 by 1,080 in which only alternate rows are refreshed in each cycle. While 720p gives slightly better images than 1080i for scenes with a great deal of motion, 1080i gives slightly greater details, which result in crisper static images. Finally, 1080p combines the progressive scan of 720p with the greater pixel count of 1080i.
HDTV’s picture mimics the “wide-screen” shape of motion pictures, with a rectangular aspect ratio of 16:9; SDTV typically appears in the nearly square 4:3 aspect ratio. Because it is digital, HD allows multicasting, whereby a single television station may broadcast different programs on several channels simultaneously. HDTV is capable of broadcasting audio in 5.1-channel “surround sound,” which is more nuanced than conventional stereo.
The U.S. government mandated that all full-power over-the-air television stations switch completely from analog to digital—though not necessarily HD—signals on February 17, 2009, but in early February the deadline was extended to June 12, 2009. This conversion, along with HDTV’s requirement of a digital display screen, drove traditional cathode-ray tube (CRT) television sets into obsolescence. The most common type of HDTV is a liquid crystal display (LCD) backlit by light-emitting diodes, called an LED TV.
