E.L. Doctorow, in full Edgar Lawrence Doctorow,  (born January 6, 1931, Bronx, New York, U.S.—died July 21, 2015, New York, New York), American novelist known for his skillful manipulation of traditional genres.
Doctorow graduated from Kenyon College (B.A., 1952) and then studied drama and directing for a year at Columbia University. He worked for a time as a script reader for Columbia Pictures in New York City. In 1959 he joined the editorial staff of the New American Library, leaving that post five years later to become editor in chief at Dial Press. He subsequently taught at several colleges and universities, including Sarah Lawrence College from 1971 to 1978. He was a visiting senior fellow at Princeton University in 1980–81 and the following year became Glucksman Professor of English and American Letters at New York University.
Doctorow was noted for the facility with which he appropriated genre conceits to illuminate the historical periods in which he set his novels. His first novel, Welcome to Hard Times (1960; film 1967), is a philosophical turn on the western genre. In his next book, Big As Life (1966), he used science fiction to explore the human response to crisis. Doctorow’s proclivity for harvesting characters from history first became apparent in The Book of Daniel (1971; film 1983), a fictionalized treatment of the execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage in 1953. In Ragtime (1975; film 1981), historical figures share the spotlight with characters emblematic  of the shifting social dynamics of early 20th-century America.
Doctorow then turned to the milieu of the Great Depression and its aftermath in the novels Loon Lake (1980), World’s Fair (1985), and Billy Bathgate (1989; film 1991). The Waterworks (1994) concerns life in 19th-century New York. City of God (2000), consisting of what are ostensibly the journal entries of a writer, splinters into several different narratives, including a detective story and a Holocaust narrative. The March (2005) follows a fictionalized version of the Union general William Tecumseh Sherman on his infamously destructive trek through Georgia, aimed at weakening the Confederate economy, during the American Civil War. Doctorow trained his sights on historical figures of less eminence in Homer and Langley (2009), a mythologization of the lives of the Collyer brothers, a pair of reclusive eccentrics whose death in 1947 revealed a nightmarish repository of curiosities and garbage in their Harlem, New York City, brownstone. In Andrew’s Brain (2014), a cognitive scientist discusses personal losses and the nature of consciousness with a psychiatrist.
Doctorow’s essays were collected in several volumes, including Reporting the Universe (2003) and Creationists: Selected Essays, 1993–2006 (2006), which contrasts the creative process as it manifests in literature and in science. Additionally, Doctorow wrote the play Drinks Before Dinner (first performed 1978) and published the short-story collections Lives of the Poets (1984), Sweet Land Stories (2004), and All the Time in the World (2011).
Doctorow was honoured with the National Humanities Medal (1998), the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction (2012), the Gold Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Book Foundation’s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters (2013), and the U.S. Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction in 2014.
