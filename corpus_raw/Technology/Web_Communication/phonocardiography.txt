Phonocardiography,  diagnostic technique that creates a graphic record, or phonocardiogram, of the sounds and murmurs produced by the contracting heart, including its valves and associated great vessels. The phonocardiogram is obtained either with a chest microphone or with a miniature sensor in the tip of a small tubular instrument that is introduced via the blood vessels into one of the heart chambers. The phonocardiogram usually supplements the information obtained by listening to body sounds with a stethoscope (auscultation) and is of special diagnostic value when performed simultaneously with measurement of the electrical properties of the heart (electrocardiography) and pulse rate.
