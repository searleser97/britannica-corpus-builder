Douglas Woolf,  (born March 23, 1922, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Jan. 18, 1992, Urbana, Ill.),  American author of gently comic fiction about people unassimilated into materialistic, technological society.
The heir of a prominent professional family, Woolf studied at Harvard University (1939–42) before serving in the American Field Service (1942–43) and the Army Air Forces (1943–45) during World War II. He also studied at the Universities of New Mexico (A.B., 1950) and Arizona. Subsequently he traveled throughout the United States and worked at a series of transitory jobs. His short stories were published in literary periodicals beginning in the 1940s, and his first novel, The Hypocritic Days, was published in 1955. Most of Woolf’s longer works concern cross-country journeys. In his most popular novel, Fade Out (1959), an elderly man rejected by his offspring makes a comic odyssey to an Arizona ghost town. Wall to Wall (1962), the story of a car salesman’s son traveling from Los Angeles to New England, is often considered Woolf’s finest work. The travels of the protagonist in On Us (1977) are interrupted by a meeting with a movie producer, and The Timing Chain (1985) relates events that occur on a car trip from the Rocky Mountains to Boston. Woolf’s short novels Ya! and John-Juan were published together in 1971, and some of his short fiction was posthumously published in Hypocritic Days & Other Tales (1993). Many of his later short tales were published by his own Wolf Run Books.
