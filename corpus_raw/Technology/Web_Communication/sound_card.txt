sound card, also called audio card,  integrated circuit that generates an audio signal and sends it to a computer’s speakers. The sound card can accept an analog sound (as from a microphone or audio tape) and convert it to digital data that can be stored in an audio file, or it can accept digitized audio signals (as from an audio file) and convert them to analog signals that can be played on the computer’s speakers. On personal computers, the functions of a sound card are usually directly integrated into the motherboard, but, for those who desire higher-quality audio, a sound card is a separate circuit board that is plugged into the motherboard.
