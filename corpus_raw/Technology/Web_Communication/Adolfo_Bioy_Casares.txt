Adolfo Bioy Casares, pseudonyms Javier Miranda and Martin Sacastru,  (born September 15, 1914, Buenos Aires, Argentina—died March 8, 1999, Buenos Aires), Argentine writer and editor, known both for his own work and for his collaborations with Jorge Luis Borges. His elegantly constructed works are oriented toward metaphysical possibilities and employ the fantastic to achieve their meanings.
Born into a wealthy family, Bioy Casares was encouraged in his writing, publishing (with the help of his father) his first book in 1929. In 1932 he met Borges, a meeting that resulted in lifelong friendship and literary collaboration. Together they edited the literary magazine Destiempo (1936). Bioy Casares published several books before 1940, including collections of short stories (such as Caos [1934; “Chaos”] and Luis Greve, muerto [1937; “Luis Greve, Deceased”]), but he did not win wide notice until the publication of his novel La invención de Morel (1940; The Invention of Morel). A carefully constructed and fantastic work, it concerns a fugitive (the narrator) who has fallen in love and strives to establish contact with a woman who is eventually revealed to be only an image created by a film projector. The novel formed the basis for Alain Robbe-Grillet’s film script for Last Year at Marienbad (1961). The novel Plan de evasión (1945; A Plan for Escape) and the six short stories of La trama celeste (1948; “The Celestial Plot”) further explore imaginary worlds, tightly constructed to adhere to a fantastic logic.
In the novel El sueño de los héroes (1954; The Dream of Heroes), Bioy Casares examines the meaning of love and the significance of dreams and memory to future actions. The novel Diario de la guerra del cerdo (1969; Diary of the War of the Pig) is a mixture of science fiction and political satire.
Other works by Bioy Casares include the collections of short stories El gran serafín (1967; “The Great Seraphim”), Historias de amor (1972; “Love Stories”), Historias fantásticas (1972; “Fantastic Stories”), and the novels Dormir al sol (1973; Asleep in the Sun) and La aventura de un fotógrafo en La Plata (1985; The Adventure of a Photographer in La Plata).
In their collaborative efforts, Bioy Casares and Borges often employed the pseudonyms Honorio Bustos Domecq, B. Suarez Lynch, and B. Lynch Davis. Together they published Seis problemas para Don Isidro Parodi (1942; Six Problems for Don Isidro Parodi) and Crónicas de Bustos Domecq (1967; Chronicles of Bustos Domecq), both of which satirize a variety of Argentine personalities. The two also edited Los mejores cuentos policiales (1943; “The Greatest Detective Stories”), a two-volume book of gaucho poetry (Poesía gauchesca, 1955), and other works. Bioy Casares collaborated with his wife, the poet Silvina Ocampo, and Borges to edit Antología de la literatura fantástica (1940; “Anthology of Fantastic Literature”; Eng. trans. The Book of Fantasy) and Antología poética argentina (1941; “Anthology of Argentine Poetry”).
In 1990 Bioy Casares was awarded the Cervantes Prize for Literature, the highest honour of Hispanic letters.
