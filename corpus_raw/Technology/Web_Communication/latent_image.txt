Latent image,   in photography, the invisible configuration of silver halide crystals on a piece of film after exposure to image-bearing focussed light; it is distinguishable from unexposed silver halide only by its ability to be reduced to metallic silver by a developing agent.
According to current theories of latent image formation, small specks of silver atoms (one ten-millionth the size of the halide) are formed on exposure by condensation and act as points of attack for the developer, which can then reduce the whole silver halide crystal to silver.
