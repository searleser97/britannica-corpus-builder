Scribner family, originally spelled Scrivener,  family of American publishers whose firm, founded in 1846 and named Charles Scribner’s Sons from 1878, issued books and several periodicals.
Charles Scribner (b. Feb. 21, 1821, New York, N.Y.—d. Aug. 26, 1871, Lucerne, Switz.) established the firm in partnership with Isaac D. Baker (d. 1850) in New York City. The Baker and Scribner list initially comprised philosophical and theological (mainly Presbyterian) books. Near the end of Scribner’s life the firm began to publish reprints and translations of British and continental European literary works. After his death the company was headed successively by his three sons: John Blair (1850–79), Charles (1854–1930), and Arthur Hawley Scribner (1859–1932). During the long presidency (1879–1928) of the second Charles Scribner, the firm published such American authors as Henry James, George Washington Cable, Theodore Roosevelt, George Santayana, Edith Wharton, Ring Lardner, and Ernest Hemingway and the British authors George Meredith, Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling, J.M. Barrie, and John Galsworthy. Later presidents were Charles Scribner (1890–1952), son of the second Charles, and his son Charles, Jr. (1921–95), who also served as president of the Princeton University Press, which had been founded (1905) by his grandfather.
Among the firm’s periodicals were Scribner’s Monthly (1870–81), St. Nicholas (1873–81), and Scribner’s Magazine (1887–1939). The first two were sold to the Century Company, Scribner’s Monthly reappearing as the Century (1881–1930) and St. Nicholas as a children’s magazine (continuing until 1939) that published many outstanding authors.
