Chancery,  in public administration, an office of public records or a public archives—so called because from medieval times the chancellor, the principal advisor to the sovereign, was the caretaker of public deeds, contracts, and other documents relating to the crown and realm. The chancery was an early development of the Normans in 11th-century England, when William I the Conqueror recognized the importance of written records to a strong, centralized government. Under William the chancery became the working establishment of the lord chancellor. By the time of William’s youngest son, Henry I (1100–35), the chancellor was in charge of the royal seals and responsible for the composition of documents.
