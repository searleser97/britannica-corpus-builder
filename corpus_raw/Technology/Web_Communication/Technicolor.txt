Technicolor,   (trademark), motion-picture process using dye-transfer techniques to produce a colour print. The Technicolor process, perfected in 1932, originally used a beam-splitting optical cube, in combination with the camera lens, to expose three black-and-white films. The light beam was split into three parts as it entered the camera, one beam favouring the red portion of the spectrum, one favouring the green, and one the blue. Each image was captured simultaneously on a separate band of black-and-white film. The three strips were developed separately and printed, after which the prints were passed through their appropriate coloured dyes; when laminated together, they produced a reasonably faithful approximation of natural colour. In a later version of the process, only one integral tri-pack colour negative film was exposed during filming, and three colour-separated negatives could then be made from this. These three colour-separated strips were appropriately dyed and then superimposed on a final emulsion to produce a full-colour image.
