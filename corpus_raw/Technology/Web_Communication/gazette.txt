Gazette,  originally, a newssheet containing an abstract of current events, the forerunner of the modern newspaper. The word is derived from the Italian gazzetta, a name given to informal news or gossip sheets first published in Venice in the mid-16th century. (Some historians speculate that the word was originally the name of a Venetian coin.) Similar sheets soon made their appearance in France and in England. The type of gazette originating from the private newsletter existed in England before the middle of the 16th century but was confined mainly to detailed accounts of diplomatic maneuvers. Upon the accession of Queen Elizabeth I, however, a far greater variety of such sheets began to appear. Aimed at a wide popular audience, they disseminated gossip, trivia, unofficial news accounts from nongovernmental sources, news of recent explorations, commercial advertisements, and the more sensational news items of the day—reports of lurid crimes, supposed miracles, witchcraft, and the like. The news collected in these sheets was contributed by volunteers, was frequently based on the accounts of anonymous witnesses, and was notorious for its inaccuracy. In the 17th century the term was increasingly applied to official government publications, such as the Oxford Gazette (founded 1665), which is considered to be England’s first true newspaper. The Oxford later became the London Gazette, which is still published as a court journal, containing records of honours, official appointments, names of bankrupts, and public notices.
