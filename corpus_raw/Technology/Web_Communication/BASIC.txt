BASIC, in fullBeginnerâ€™s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code,  computer programming language developed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College in the mid 1960s. One of the simplest high-level languages, with commands similar to English, it can be learned with relative ease even by schoolchildren and novice programmers. It had simple data structures and notation, and it was interpreted: a BASIC program was translated line-by-line and executed as it was translated, which made it easy to locate programming errors. Its small size and simplicity made BASIC a popular language for early personal computers. Its recent forms such as Visual Basic have adopted many of the data and control structures of other contemporary languages, which makes it more powerful but less convenient for beginners.
