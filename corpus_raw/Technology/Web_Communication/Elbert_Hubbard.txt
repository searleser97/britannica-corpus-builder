Elbert Hubbard, in full Elbert Green Hubbard,  (born June 19, 1856, Bloomington, Ill., U.S.—died  May 7, 1915, at sea off Ireland), American editor, publisher, and author of the moralistic essay “A Message to Garcia.”
A freelance newspaperman and head of sales and advertising for a manufacturing company, Hubbard retired in 1892 and founded his Roycroft Press in 1893 at East Aurora, N.Y., on the model of William Morris’ communal Kelmscott Press, which he had visited in England. Beginning in 1895 he issued monthly the famous “Little Journey” booklets. These were pleasant biographical essays on famous persons, in which fact was interwoven with comment and satire. Hubbard also began publishing The Philistine, an avant-garde magazine, which he ultimately wrote single-handedly. In an 1899 number of The Philistine, “A Message to Garcia” appeared, in which the importance of perseverance was drawn as a moral from a Spanish-American War incident. In 1908 Hubbard began to edit and publish a second monthly, The Fra. His printing establishment in time expanded to include furniture and leather shops, a smithy, and an art school, as had the operations of William Morris. Hubbard died in the sinking of the ocean liner Lusitania.
Hubbard’s writings contain a bizarre mixture of radicalism and conservatism. He apotheosized work and efficiency in a vigorous, epigrammatic style. Valuable collections of his writings are Little Journeys, 14 vol. (1915), and Selected Writings, 14 vol. (1923). His Scrap Book (1923) and Note Book (1927) were published posthumously.
