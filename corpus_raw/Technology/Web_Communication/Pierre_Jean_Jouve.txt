Pierre-Jean Jouve,  (born Oct. 11, 1887, Arras, Fr.—died  Jan. 8, 1976, Paris), French poet, novelist, and critic.
Early in his career, Jouve was influenced by the Abbaye group and for a time published a journal, Bandeaux d’or. His earliest verses, Les Muses romaines et florentines (1910; “Roman and Florentine Muses”), Présences (1912; “Presences”), and Parler (1913; “Speaking”), were inspired by Symbolism.
Prevented by ill health from serving in World War I, Jouve spent the war years in Switzerland, serving as a volunteer hospital orderly and writing pacifist verses. Works of this period include Vous êtes des hommes (1915; “You Are Men”) and Danse des morts (1917; “Dance of the Dead”). In 1924 Jouve converted to Roman Catholicism and, concurrently, became fascinated with psychoanalysis—events which caused him to reject his earlier style and adopt the themes that concerned him throughout his life: guilt, sexuality, and death. Spirituality and eroticism were merged in such collections of verse as Les Mystérieuses Noces (1925; “Mysterious Weddings”), Nouvelles Noces (1926; “New Weddings”), and Sueur de sang (1935; “Sweat of Blood”). The same mixture also appears in such prose works as Paulina 1880 (1925; Eng. trans., 1973), Le Monde désert (1927; “The Deserted World”), and La Scène capitale (1935; “The Crucial Scene”).
Jouve spent the World War II years in Geneva, where he wrote La Vièrge de Paris (1944; “The Virgin of Paris”). The postwar years, spent in Paris, saw the publication of other important collections of verse and explorations of language such as Ode (1950), Langue (1952; “Language”), Lyrique (1956), and Moires (1962; “Watered Silk”). Jouve also wrote critical essays on 19th-century French writers and artists and was an adept translator. His lifelong interest in music resulted in keen and perceptive music criticism, especially in Le Don Juan de Mozart (1942; Mozart’s Don Juan, 1957). He was awarded the French Academy’s Grand Prix de Poésie in 1966.
