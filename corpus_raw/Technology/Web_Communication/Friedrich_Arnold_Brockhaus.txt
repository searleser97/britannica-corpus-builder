Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus,  (born May 4, 1772, Dortmund, Ger.—died  Aug. 20, 1823, Leipzig), German publisher and editor of a respected German-language encyclopaedia.
In 1808 Brockhaus purchased the copyright of the bankrupt Konversationslexikon, which had been started in 1796 by Renatus Gotthelf Löbel. In 1811 Brockhaus completed the first edition of this encyclopaedia (renamed a century later Der grosse Brockhaus [“The Grand Brockhaus”], and a second edition under his editorship was begun in 1812.
In 1818 Brockhaus moved to Leipzig, where he established a large printing house. Among his many literary undertakings were critical periodicals and large historical, bibliographical, and reference works.
The business was carried on by his sons Friedrich (1800–65), who retired in 1850, and Heinrich (1804–74), under whom it was considerably extended. The latter was succeeded by his sons Eduard (1829–1914) and Rudolf (1838–98). The business was continued by members of the family and after World War II was established at Wiesbaden.
