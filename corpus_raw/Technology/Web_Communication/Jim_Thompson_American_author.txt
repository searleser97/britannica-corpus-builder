Jim Thompson, in full James Myers Thompson,  (born Sept. 27, 1906, Anadarko, Okla., U.S.—died April 7, 1977, Los Angeles, Calif.), American novelist and screenwriter best known for his paperback pulp novels narrated by seemingly normal men who are revealed to be psychopathic.
After graduating from the University of Nebraska, Thompson worked in a number of odd jobs before becoming affiliated with the Federal Writers’ Project in the 1930s. He later worked as a journalist for the New York Daily News and the Los Angeles Times Mirror. Blacklisted for leftist politics during the anticommunist scare of the early 1950s, Thompson was later summoned to Hollywood by director Stanley Kubrick to cowrite screenplays for The Killing (1956) and Paths of Glory (1957).
Thompson’s reputation rests on his ability to enter the minds of the criminally insane. The Killer Inside Me (1952) is admired as a chilling depiction of a criminally warped mind; its narrator, a small-town deputy, pretends to be an agreeable hick but is actually a calculating madman who, like most Thompson narrators, speaks directly and colloquially to the reader. After Dark, My Sweet (1955), considered one of Thompson’s best works, presents a mentally imbalanced narrator who becomes embroiled in a kidnapping scheme with his lover but kills himself rather than harm her.
The posthumous publication of two Thompson omnibuses—Hardcore (1986) and More Hardcore (1987)—and a short-story collection, Fireworks: The Lost Writings of Jim Thompson (1988), revived interest in his work as classic hard-boiled crime fiction. One of his novels, The Grifters (1963), a tale of con artists, was made into a successful film in 1990.
