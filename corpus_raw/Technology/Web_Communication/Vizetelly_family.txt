Vizetelly family, originally spelled Vizzetelli,  family of Italian descent active in journalism and publishing from the late 18th century in England and later in France (briefly) and the United States.
James Henry Vizetelly (died 1838) published Cruikshank’s Comic Almanack and other British annuals. His son Henry Richard (1820–94) was a correspondent (chiefly in Paris) for The Illustrated London News and the founder of two brief competitors. In 1852 he published a best-selling cheap reprint of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, by the American novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe. Forming his own company in 1882, he published inexpensive editions (later called the “Mermaid Series”) of early English dramatists and translations of Gustave Flaubert, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, and other continental European authors. For publishing the novels of Émile Zola, Vizetelly was fined and then (1889) was jailed on charges of obscenity, the imprisonment permanently damaging his health. In his final years he was nevertheless able to publish a cheerful, anecdotal account of literary life in London and Paris from 1840 to 1870, entitled Glances Back Through Seventy Years: Autobiographical and Other Reminiscences (1893). His younger brother Frank (1830–83?) helped to establish (1857) the Paris periodical Le Monde illustré, which he edited for two years. He later served for 24 years (1859–83) as a war correspondent for The Illustrated London News in Giuseppi Garibaldi’s Italy, in Spain, in the American Civil War, and in Egypt. He disappeared (either slain or enslaved) during a British military disaster in the Sudan.
Edward Henry Vizetelly (1847–1903), son of Henry Richard by his first marriage, also was a war correspondent, for the London Daily News and The New York Times. His brother Ernest Alfred (1853–1922) was a translator and biographer (1904) of Zola and the author of several books on French history from 1852. Francis Horace (afterward Frank) Vizetelly (1864–1938), Henry Richard’s only son by a second marriage, emigrated to the United States (1891), where he formed a lifetime association with the publishing house of Funk and Wagnalls. Beginning as assistant on the Standard Dictionary of the English Language (1894), he was from 1912 the chief editor of the abridgments and succeeding works, notably the New Standard Dictionary (1913). He was a prolific contributor to newspapers and magazines; “The Lexicographer’s Easy Chair,” his correspondence column in the journal Literary Digest, was the most successful American feature-column of its kind. In 1930 he established a school for announcers of the Columbia Broadcasting System; rejecting British pronunciation, he insisted on American standards. Though not fully conversant with modern linguistics, he was a force for linguistic realism. On his death in New York City in 1938, The New York Times appraised him as “philologist, instructor, and entertainer in ordinary to the American people.”
