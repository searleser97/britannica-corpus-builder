Herbert grew up in Montclair, New Jersey. He began his career in journalism in 1970 as a reporter for The Star-Ledger in Newark, New Jersey; three years later he became the publication’s night city editor. From 1976 to 1985 Herbert worked as a reporter and an editor for the New York Daily News, where he joined the editorial board and became one of its columnists. He received a B.A. in journalism from Empire State College in 1988.
Herbert was a founding panelist of the weekly discussion show Sunday Edition that aired on the New York affiliate of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and served as the host of the weekly current-affairs show Hotline on New York public television.
