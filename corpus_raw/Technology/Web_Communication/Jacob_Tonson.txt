Jacob Tonson,  (born 1656?—died  April 2, 1736, Ledbury, Eng.), publisher in London who issued (1697) John Dryden’s translation of Virgil, believed to be the first English publishing venture to earn considerable money for the author. He also published anthologies of poetry edited by Dryden (from 1684); the same writer’s Fables Ancient and Modern (1700; translations from Homer, Ovid, Boccaccio, and Chaucer); poetry by Alexander Pope (1709); and various works by Joseph Addison. In 1712 he became copublisher of The Spectator, a notable periodical founded by Addison and Sir Richard Steele and largely written by Addison.
