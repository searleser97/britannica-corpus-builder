Cable modem,  modem used to convert analog data signals to digital form and vise versa, for transmission or receipt over cable television lines, especially for connecting to the Internet. A cable modem modulates and demodulates signals like a telephone modem but is a much more complex device. Data can be transferred over cable lines much more quickly than over traditional phone lines. Transmission rates range from about 8 megabits per second (Mbps) for basic services to some 50 Mbps for premium services. Cable Internet access is regarded as a replacement for slower dial-up, ISDN, and DSL connections. See also broadband technology.
