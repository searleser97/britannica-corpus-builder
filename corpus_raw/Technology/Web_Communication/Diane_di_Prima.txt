Diane di Prima,  (born August 6, 1934, New York, New York, U.S.—died October 25, 2020, San Francisco, California), American poet, one of the few women of the Beat movement to attain prominence.
After attending Swarthmore (Pennsylvania) College (1951–53), di Prima moved to New York City’s Greenwich Village, living the bohemian lifestyle that typified the Beat movement. Her first book of poetry, This Kind of Bird Flies Backward, was published in 1958. In 1961 di Prima and LeRoi Jones (now Amiri Baraka) began a monthly poetry journal, Floating Bear, that featured their own poetry and that of other notable Beat writers such as Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs. Di Prima and Jones were charged with (but not indicted for) sending obscene material through the mail. Jones left Floating Bear after two years, but di Prima continued as its editor until publication ceased in 1969. Di Prima also founded two publishing houses that specialized in works by avant-garde poets—The Poets Press and Eidolon Editions. Between 1974 and 1992 she taught at a number of institutions, including the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colo., New College of California, California College of Arts and Crafts, and the San Francisco Art Institute.
Although di Prima’s career reflects the political and social upheaval of the United States during the decades of the 1960s and ’70s, her writing was of a more personal nature; poems about her relationships, her children, and the experiences of everyday life figure prominently. Much of di Prima’s subsequent writing reflects her interests in Eastern religions, alchemy, and female archetypes. Her collections of poetry include The New Handbook of Heaven (1963), Poems for Freddie (1966; later published as Freddie Poems [1974]), Earthsong: Poems 1957–59 (1968), The Book of Hours (1970), Loba, Parts 1–8 (1978), Pieces of a Song (1990), and 22 Death Poems (1996). She also wrote Dinners and Nightmares (1961; rev. ed., 1974), a book of short stories; a number of plays (collected in Zipcode [1992]); and several autobiographical works, including Memoirs of a Beatnik (1969) and Recollections of My Life as a Woman: The New York Years (2001), a memoir of her abusive childhood in Brooklyn and her experiences as a woman in the male-dominated Beat movement.
