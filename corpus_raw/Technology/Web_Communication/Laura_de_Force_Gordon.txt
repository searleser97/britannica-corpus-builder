Laura de Force Gordon, née Laura de Force,  (born Aug. 17, 1838, North East, Pa., U.S.—died April 5, 1907, Lodi, Calif.),  American lawyer, editor, and reformer, one of the first women in the American West to speak and campaign for women’s rights, who also pioneered in professions normally reserved for men.
Laura de Force attended local schools in her hometown. In 1862 she married Charles H. Gordon (later divorced). They lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, during the American Civil War and traveled west to Nevada in 1867. In 1870 they settled in Mokelumne (later Lodi), California.
Laura Gordon had for some years given occasional public lectures, and the trip west by wagon shortly became one of her topics. In February 1868 she delivered in San Francisco a call for equal rights for women, one of the first such public appeals to be made in the West. She lectured on woman suffrage throughout the region and in 1870 contributed materially to the founding of the California Woman Suffrage Society, serving as president in 1877 and again from 1884 to 1894. In 1871 she was nominated for the state Senate by her local Independence Party.
In 1873 Gordon became editor of the woman’s department of the Narrow Gauge, a semiweekly paper published in Stockton, California. Later, in September 1873, she began publishing and editing the Stockton Weekly Leader. Her editorial ability—and the novelty of having a woman editor—made the paper an immediate success, and in May 1874 it became a daily. The following year she moved the paper to Sacramento, where it appeared as the Weekly Leader; she sold it a year later. From 1875 to 1878 she edited the Oakland Daily Democrat. In 1877 she published The Great Geysers of California and How to Reach Them.
While covering the 1877–78 session of the state legislature for her paper and for the Sacramento Bee, Gordon lobbied effectively on behalf of a bill drafted by Clara S. Foltz that would admit women to the practice of law in California. Later in 1878 she applied for admission to the Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, but she and Foltz, who also had applied, were denied admission, whereupon they instituted a suit against the school. They argued their case jointly in district court and in the fall of 1879 before the state Supreme Court and won. Gordon had meanwhile been reading law privately, and in December 1879 she and Foltz were the second and third women admitted to the California bar. Gordon practiced in San Francisco for five years and then moved to Stockton. She won an impressive reputation at the bar, notably—and remarkably—as a criminal lawyer; a number of her successful defenses in murder cases were widely discussed. In February 1885 she was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.
