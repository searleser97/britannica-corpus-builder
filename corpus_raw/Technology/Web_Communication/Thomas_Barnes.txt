Thomas Barnes,  (born Sept. 16, 1785, London, Eng.—died  May 7, 1841, London), British journalist who as editor of The Times for many years established its reputation and founded a tradition of independent journalism.
The son of a solicitor, Barnes was educated at Christ’s Hospital and at Pembroke College, Cambridge. After studying in the chambers of Joseph Chitty, he abandoned the idea of being called to the bar and began writing on literature, theatre, and politics in his friend Leigh Hunt’s Reflector and Examiner and in John Scott’s Champion, to which he contributed literary portraits under the pseudonym “Strada.” His political sketches in the Examiner were collected and published anonymously as Parliamentary Portraits in 1815. Meanwhile, he had also been contributing to The Times; and in 1817 he was appointed to the editorship, which he held until his death. Despite ill health and somewhat intemperate habits, Barnes brought The Times from comparative obscurity to the position of Britain’s leading newspaper.
Barnes exerted his considerable influence in favour of the Reform bill and acquired for himself and his paper the nickname “the Thunderer.” In 1834 he was described by the lord chancellor Lord Lyndhurst as “the most powerful man in the country.” Barnes first collaborated but later quarreled with Lord Brougham. Barnes sponsored Benjamin Disraeli’s “Letters to Statesmen,” signed “Runnymede” (1836–39).
