David Hughes, in full David Edward Hughes,  (born May 16, 1831, London, England—died January 22, 1900, London), Anglo-American inventor of the carbon microphone, which was important to the development of telephony.
Hughes’s family emigrated to the United States when he was seven years old. In 1850 he became professor of music at St. Joseph’s College, Bardstown, Kentucky. Five years later he took out a U.S. patent for a type-printing telegraph instrument; its success was immediate, and in 1857 Hughes took it to Europe, where it came into widespread use and in some places continued in use until the 1930s. Hughes’s microphone, invented in 1878, was the forerunner of the various carbon microphones that were used in most telephones produced in the 20th century.
From 1879 to 1886 Hughes performed a series of experiments in which his equipment transmitted wireless signals up to 500 yards. The observed effects were attributed to induction by other scientists. Hughes disagreed but did not know how the transmissions were working. It was not realized until 1899, after German physicist Heinrich Hertz’s radio wave experiments in the late 1880s, that Hughes had been the first to produce radio waves.
