Carolyn Forché, in full Carolyn Louise Forché, née Sidlosky,  (born April 28, 1950, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), American poet whose concern for human rights is reflected in her writing, especially in the collection The Country Between Us (1981), which examines events she witnessed in El Salvador.
Forché was educated at Michigan State (B.A., 1972) and Bowling Green State (M.F.A., 1975) universities. Thereafter she taught at a number of colleges and universities. Her first collection of poetry, Gathering the Tribes (1976), evokes her childhood, her Slovak ancestry, and reflections on sexuality, family, and race.
From 1978 to 1980 Forché was a journalist in El Salvador, where, in addition to her involvement in Amnesty International as a human-rights advocate, she translated works by Salvadoran poets. Her work on behalf of human rights became a major focus of her poetry, much of which depicts the terrible cruelties that were inflicted on children victimized by the war. The later five-part book-length poem The Angel of History (1994) is a compelling distillation of Forché’s intensely moral sensibility. Later poetry collections included Blue Hour (2003) and In the Lateness of the World (2020).
Forché also edited several books, including Against Forgetting: Twentieth-Century Poetry of Witness (1993), and translated the poetry of Claribel Alegría. In 2019 she published the autobiography What You Have Heard Is True: A Memoir of Witness and Resistance.
