Isaiah Thomas,  (born January 19, 1749, Boston, Massachusetts [U.S.]—died April 4, 1831, Worcester, Massachusetts, U.S.), radical anti-British printer and journalist who published the Massachusetts Spy from 1770 to 1801. (The paper continued publication until 1904.)
At an early age Thomas was apprenticed to a printer, and by the age of 17 he was regarded an excellent printer himself. With a partner he founded the Massachusetts Spy in Boston in 1770, and he soon bought out his partner. In 1775, as armed conflict broke out between American colonists and British soldiers in Massachusetts, Thomas moved the Massachusetts Spy to nearby Worcester. The paper carried the first eyewitness account of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the opening engagements of the American Revolutionary War, and the reports helped to solidify colonial resistance to British rule. The Massachusetts Spy became recognized as one of the most important newspapers in the colonies.
Thomas branched out into bookselling activities in 1788, and at one time he had more than 20 bookstores operating in the Boston area. He published popular books for both children and adults. Thomas was an astute businessman, and he grew wealthy in his various ventures. He turned over control of the Massachusetts Spy to his son in 1801.
Thomas’s library was the major documentary source for the monumental A History of Printing in America, compiled over two years and published in two volumes in 1810 and still a major historical source. He founded the American Antiquarian Society.
