HTTP, in full HyperText Transfer Protocol,  standard application-level protocol used for exchanging files on the World Wide Web. HTTP runs on top of the TCP/IP protocol. Web browsers are HTTP clients that send file requests to Web servers, which in turn handle the requests via an HTTP service. HTTP was originally proposed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, who was a coauthor of the 1.0 specification. HTTP in its 1.0 version was “stateless”: each new request from a client established a new connection instead of handling all similar requests through the same connection between a specific client and server. Version 1.1 includes persistent connections, decompression of HTML files by client browsers, and multiple domain names sharing the same IP address.
