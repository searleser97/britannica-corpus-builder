Carlos P. Romulo, in full Carlos Peña Romulo,  (born January 14, 1899, Camiling, Philippines—died December 15, 1985, Manila), Philippine general, diplomat, and journalist known for his activities on behalf of the Allies during World War II and his later work with the United Nations.
In 1931 Romulo was made editor in chief of TVT Publications, comprising three newspapers, one in English, one in Spanish, and one in Tagalog (the second most prevalent language in the Philippines). In 1937 he became publisher of another chain of newspapers.
When Japan attacked the Philippines in 1941, he became an aide-de-camp to U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur on Corregidor Island, and his broadcasts became widely known as the “Voice of Freedom.” After Japan captured Corregidor, Romulo went with MacArthur to Australia and then joined the Philippine government-in-exile of Pres. Manuel Quezon in Washington, D.C., as secretary of information.
In 1941 Romulo won the Pulitzer Prize for Peace for his prewar evaluations of the military situation in the Pacific area. He returned to the Philippines with U.S. forces in 1945. In 1948 he served as president of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information in Geneva.
Romulo was president of the General Assembly of the UN (1949–50) and in 1950 became secretary of foreign affairs of the Philippines. In 1952 he was named ambassador to the United States. No longer satisfied with the politics of the incumbent Liberal Party, he decided in 1953 to run for the presidency of the Philippines on a third-party ticket, but he withdrew to become campaign manager for the successful Nacionalista Party candidate, Ramon Magsaysay. At the Bandung Conference of Afro-Asian countries in 1955, he criticized the tyranny of both communist rule and Western colonialism.
When the Philippines was elected to a seat on the United Nations Security Council in 1956, Romulo served as member of the council and during the month of January 1957 was its chairman. He served as president of the University of the Philippines, near Manila (1962–68), and secretary of education (1966–68). He then became secretary of foreign affairs (1968–78) and minister of foreign affairs (1978–84). In his later years, while serving under Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos, Romulo became less democratic in his views. He supported Marcos’s imposition of martial law in 1972 and had by the mid-1970s evolved from a champion of a free press into an advocate of a controlled press, charging Western journalists with unfavourably reporting the problems of less-developed countries. Romulo’s autobiography, I Walked with Heroes, was published in 1961.
