William F. Buckley, Jr., in full William Frank Buckley, Jr.,  (born November 24, 1925, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 27, 2008, Stamford, Connecticut), versatile American editor, author, and conservative gadfly who became an important intellectual influence in conservative politics.
The oil fortune amassed by Buckley’s father enabled the boy to be reared in comfortable circumstances in France, England, and Connecticut, U.S. His early education was by private tutors and at two English boys’ schools, and he attended a preparatory school in New York state. He spent a year at the University of Mexico, then served three years in the U.S. Army during World War II before entering Yale University. There he taught Spanish, distinguished himself in debate, and was chairman of the Yale Daily News, among other things. He later joined the staff of The American Mercury. A former chairman of the Starr Broadcasting Group, he served on the United States Information Agency (USIA) Advisory Commission from 1969 to 1972. In 1973 he was U.S. delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.
Buckley founded the conservative journal National Review in 1955, and as editor in chief he used the journal as a forum for conservative views and ideas. His column of political commentary, “On the Right,” was syndicated in 1962 and appeared regularly in more than 200 newspapers. From 1966 to 1999 Buckley served as host of Firing Line, a weekly television interview program dealing with politics and public affairs.
A contributor to many magazines, Buckley wrote a number of books, among them God and Man at Yale (1951), Up from Liberalism (1959), and Rumbles Left and Right (1963). He coauthored McCarthy and His Enemies (1954), and in the late 1970s he turned his hand to writing spy novels; among them were Saving the Queen (1976), Marco Polo, If You Can (1982), A Very Private Plot (1994), and the final entry in the series, Last Call for Blackford Oakes (2005).
