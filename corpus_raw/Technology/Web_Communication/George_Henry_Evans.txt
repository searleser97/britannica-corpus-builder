George Henry Evans,  (born March 25, 1805, Bromyard, Herefordshire, Eng.—died  Feb. 2, 1856, Granville, N.J., U.S.), American pro-labour social reformer and newspaper editor who sought to enhance the position of workers by agitating for free homesteads.
Evans immigrated with his father to the United States in 1820 and was apprenticed to a printer in Ithaca, N.Y. By the end of the decade, he had founded his own newspaper, the Working Man’s Advocate, and in 1829 he joined with Robert Dale Owen and Frances Wright to help found the Workingmen’s Party.
In his newspaper and later in his book History of the Origin and Progress of the Working Men’s Party (1840), Evans elucidated his reform program while opposing other reform philosophies. Wages would stay high, he asserted, as long as there was a “safety valve” (i.e., cheap farmland) to draw off excess workers. Believing that land policies could be changed through political action, Evans organized the National Reform Association. Through its numerous state branches, the organization pressed for free homesteads in the West. The group’s motto was “Vote yourself a farm,” and Congress eventually responded by passing the Homestead Act (1862).
Evans also fought for the abolition of slavery, of imprisonment for debt, and of all types of monopolies (including the Bank of the United States). Unlike many male social reformers of his era, moreover, Evans also advocated equal rights for women.
