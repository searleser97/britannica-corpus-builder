Constance M.K. Applebee, byname the Apple,  (born June 4, 1873, Chigwell, Essex, Eng.—died Jan. 26, 1981, Burley, Hampshire), British athlete who introduced and promoted the sport of women’s field hockey in the United States.
Applebee was a frail child and received her education at home from local clergymen. She studied physical education, in part, to improve her health, ultimately graduating from London’s British College of Physical Education.
In 1901, while attending a summer course at Harvard University, Applebee demonstrated to the class the popular English women’s game of field hockey and thus introduced the sport to the United States. One of her classmates, Harriet Ballintine, who was director of athletics at Vassar College, invited Applebee to teach the sport at Vassar. Enthusiasm for field hockey soon spread to other women’s colleges—Smith, Wellesley, Mount Holyoke, Radcliffe, and Bryn Mawr—and eventually to public universities as well. In 1901 Applebee and Ballintine helped found the American Field Hockey Association, which governed the sport for 20 years.
Beginning in 1904 and continuing for 25 years, Applebee served as director of outdoor sports at Bryn Mawr. In 1922 she helped found the United States Field Hockey Association, and the following year created a field hockey camp in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. She was for 10 years the editor and publisher of Sportswoman, a magazine for women athletes—the first of its kind in the United States. Throughout her long career, Applebee commuted between England and the United States, teaching young women the game of field hockey and coaching them in the importance of sportsmanship. She did not retire until she had reached the age of 94, and she lived to be 107.
