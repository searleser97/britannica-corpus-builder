PlayStation,  video game console released in 1994 by Sony Computer Entertainment. The PlayStation, one of a new generation of 32-bit consoles, signaled Sony’s rise to power in the video game world. Also known as the PS One, the PlayStation used compact discs (CDs), heralding the video game industry’s move away from cartridges.
After a failed venture with Nintendo to release the PlayStation as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System–CD in the early 1990s, Sony made the decision to market its own console. The PlayStation was released in Japan in December 1994, and it made its American debut in September 1995; both releases elicited critical acclaim and impressive sales. Titles such as Twisted Metal and Ridge Racer were very popular. By 2005 the PlayStation had become the first console ever to ship 100 million units. PlayStation’s premier games included fan favourites such as Final Fantasy 7, Crash Bandicoot, and Tekken, all of which spawned numerous sequels.
The original PlayStation continued production until March 2005, when it was eclipsed by the next generation of 64-bit consoles, including Sony’s own PlayStation 2 (PS2; introduced in the early 2000s). The PS2 offered an ability to play over the Internet, which, combined with the most extensive line of games ever marketed for a console, led to its sales dominance over its 64-bit rivals Sega Dreamcast and Nintendo GameCube. In fact, PlayStation 2 went on to ship 100 million units faster than any of its predecessors or contemporaries. However, the next installment of the PlayStation consoles, the PlayStation 3 (released in 2006 and 2007), did not enjoy the same initial success as the earlier incarnations of the console, with ongoing competition from the Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii.
In 2013 Sony released the PlayStation 4 (PS4), a next-generation console designed to compete with the Xbox One. Critics and players embraced the new platform, which boasted outstanding graphics and a smooth online multiplayer experience. The PS4 also doubled as a Blu-ray player and a media streaming device, and Sony’s PlayStation Now subscription service provided access to hundreds of current and legacy games. Sony entered the expanding virtual reality (VR) market with the release of the PlayStation VR (PS VR) in October 2016. The PS VR system included a PS4 as well as a VR headset and controllers. The PS VR was priced well below similar PC-based VR systems, leading many to assume that it would make significant inroads into the market, but sluggish sales across the VR industry led analysts to drastically downgrade their expectations.
