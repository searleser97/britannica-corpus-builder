Oveta Culp Hobby, née Oveta Culp,  (born January 19, 1905, Killeen, Texas, U.S.—died August 16, 1995, Houston, Texas), American editor and publisher of the Houston Post (1952–53), first director of the U.S. Women’s Army Corps (1942–45), and first secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (1953–55).
Culp was educated privately and for a time attended Mary Hardin-Baylor College. A graduate of the University of Texas Law School, she served as parliamentarian of the Texas House of Representatives (1925–31), and in 1930 she became assistant to the city attorney of Houston. In 1931 she married William Pettus Hobby, a former governor of Texas (1917–21) and publisher of the Houston Post-Dispatch (later the Houston Post). She went to work for the newspaper, introduced a number of features of interest to women, and by 1938 was executive vice president.
In 1937 she published a handbook on parliamentary law titled “Mr. Chairman,” and in 1939 and 1941 she again served briefly in her former post in the Texas House. In July 1941 she was appointed chief of the women’s division of the Bureau of Public Relations in the War Department. She subsequently helped develop plans for a women’s auxiliary branch for the army, and on creation of the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corps (the name was later changed to Women’s Army Corps [WAC]) on May 14, 1942, she was appointed director with relative rank of major, later raised to colonel. She directed the corps throughout World War II, until July 1945, by which time the WAC had grown to a force of 100,000.
After the war Hobby resigned her commission to return to the Post as coeditor and publisher. Hobby also worked as a director of KPRC radio and television broadcasting in Houston, served as a consultant to the Hoover Commission investigating governmental efficiency, and became active in national Republican politics, helping elect Dwight D. Eisenhower to the presidency and in January 1953 was named director of the Federal Security Administration (FSA). In March the FSA was elevated to Cabinet status as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and Hobby, as the first secretary of HEW, became in April the second woman to hold a U.S. Cabinet position. She retained the post until resigning in July 1955. In that year she became president and editor of the Post; she became chairman of the board of the Post in 1965 and remained in that position until the paper was sold in 1983 to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company. She was a director of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from 1968 and of a number of other corporations.
