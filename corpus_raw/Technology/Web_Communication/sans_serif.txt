Sans serif,   in printing, a style of roman letter stripped of its serif—i.e., such embellishments as the vertical line at the end of the top right and lower left curved segments of the letter “s,” the base line on which the lowercase “n,” “m,” and “l” rest, etc. Though the concept of such a type has challenged recent designers, the face itself is used largely for display purposes, in which continuous reading is not a requirement. Inconclusive tests appear to indicate that the roman face is easier to read with serifs than without them. It has been suggested, again inconclusively, that the sans serif type suffers in that its characters, when printed, tend somehow to stand out as individual letters rather than as parts of words.
