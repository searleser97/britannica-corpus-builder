William Joyce, byname Lord Haw-haw,  (born April 24, 1906, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Jan. 3, 1946, London, Eng.), English-language propaganda broadcaster from Nazi Germany during World War II whose nickname was derived from the sneering manner of his speech.
Though his father was a naturalized U.S. citizen, Joyce lived most of his life in Ireland and England. He was active in Sir Oswald Mosley’s British fascist organization and was also a cofounder of the National Socialist League. In 1938 Joyce obtained a British passport, claiming to be a British subject. The passport was renewed in August 1939, the month in which Joyce went to Germany to offer his services to Josef Goebbels’ Nazi propaganda ministry. His broadcasts to England occasioned amusement more than they sapped morale, but after his arrest in May 1945 he was tried for treason. Though he had never been a British subject, the prosecution argued that he owed his allegiance to Great Britain while in possession of a passport. Joyce was found guilty and hanged.
