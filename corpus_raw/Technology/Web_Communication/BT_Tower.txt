BT Tower, also called British Telecom Tower, formerly Post Office Tower and London Telecom Tower,  communications tower and landmark located west of the Bloomsbury district in the borough of Camden, London.
One of the taller structures in southeastern England, it was erected in 1961–65 to the architectural designs of Eric Bedford. Including its crowning 40-foot (12-metre) mast, the tower rises to 620 feet (189 metres). It is used for the telecommunications broadcasts of British Telecom. The structure was a popular tourist attraction until 1971, when the explosion of a terrorist’s bomb precipitated its closure to the public.
