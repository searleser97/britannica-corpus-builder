Francis J. Child, in full Francis James Child,  (born February1, 1825, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died September 11, 1896, Boston), American scholar and educator important for his systematic study, collecting, and cataloging of folk ballads.
Child graduated from Harvard University in 1846, and later, after studying in Europe, he succeeded Edward T. Channing in 1851 as Boylston professor of rhetoric, oratory, and elocution and in 1876 became professor of English at Harvard. Child studied English drama and Germanic philology, the latter at Berlin and Göttingen during a leave of absence (1849–51). He edited the poetic works of Edmund Spenser, 5 vol. (1855), and published an important treatise on Geoffrey Chaucer in the Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for 1863.
His largest undertaking grew out of an original collection of English and Scottish Ballads, 8 vol. (1857–58). Child accumulated in the Harvard library one of the largest folklore collections in existence, studied manuscript rather than printed versions of old ballads, and investigated songs and stories in other languages that were related to the English and Scottish ballads. His final collection was published as The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, first in 10 parts (1882–98) and then in 5 quarto volumes, containing 305 ballads. Few significant additions have been made since, and Child’s collection remains the authoritative treasury.
