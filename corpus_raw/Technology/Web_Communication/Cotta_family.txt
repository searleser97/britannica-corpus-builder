Cotta Family,   family of German publishers, the most notable of whom, Johann Friedrich Cotta, Baron von Cottendorf, is celebrated for his connection with J.W. von Goethe and other writers of the period.
Johann Georg Cotta (1631–92), the founder of the publishing house, settled in Württemberg and in 1659 acquired by marriage the bookseller’s business of Philipp Brunn at Tübingen, thereby establishing the J.G. Cotta’sche Buchhandlung. On his death the firm passed to his son Johann Georg (2) and after him to his eldest son Johann Georg (3). Christoph Friedrich Cotta (1730–1807), son of Johann Georg (3), established a printing house to the court at Stuttgart. It was his son, Johann Friedrich, who restored the fortunes of the family firm, then in decline, and who became the best known of the Cottas.
Johann Friedrich Cotta, Baron von Cottendorf (b. April 27, 1764—d. Dec. 29, 1832), studied at Tübingen and qualified as a barrister but, learning that the family business at Tübingen was to be sold, took upon himself the task of restoration. In 1794 he planned with Friedrich von Schiller Die Horen, a periodical that, although it ran only until 1797, has a place in the history of German literature. Through Schiller, Cotta met Goethe, and his connection with other literary men increased. He became in time the publisher not only for Goethe but also for such writers as Johann Gottfried von Herder, Christoph Martin Wieland, A.W. Schlegel, Ludwig Tieck, Jean Paul, and Heinrich von Kleist. He also published for the brothers Humboldt and for such philosophers as Johann Gottlieb Fichte and G.W.F. Hegel. In 1798 Cotta began to publish the Allgemeine Zeitung. (Censorship difficulties caused the editorial office of the newspaper to be transferred from Tübingen to Stuttgart, in 1803 to Ulm, in 1810 to Augsburg, and in 1882 to Munich. It ceased publication in its traditional form in 1912.) In 1811 the firm moved to Stuttgart, and in 1823 Cotta started a branch in Augsburg and in 1827 one in Munich. By that time he had made his publishing house one of the foremost in Germany. He attended the Congress of Vienna to make, among other commissions, a plea for freedom of the press on behalf of German booksellers. He also had scientific interests, introducing in 1824 the first steam printing presses in Bavaria into his Augsburg branch.
His son Johann Georg Cotta (4), Baron von Cottendorf (1796–1863), extended the firm by buying in 1839 the business of G.J. Göschen in Leipzig and in 1845 that of Vogel in Landshut. In the same year, Bible branches were started at Stuttgart and Munich.
Johann Georg (4) was succeeded by his son Karl and by his nephew Hermann Albert von Reischach. They preserved the Stuttgart branch and the Allgemeine Zeitung office in Augsburg, but the other branches gradually broke away. In 1889 the firm was bought by Adolf and Paul Kröner. The buildings were badly damaged in World War II, but the firm was subsequently reestablished.
