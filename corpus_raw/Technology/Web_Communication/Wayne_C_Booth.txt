Wayne C. Booth, in full Wayne Clayson Booth,  (born February 22, 1921, American Fork, Utah, U.S.—died October 10, 2005, Chicago, Illinois), American critic and teacher associated with the Chicago school of literary criticism.
Booth attended Brigham Young University in Salt Lake City, Utah (B.A., 1944), and the University of Chicago (M.A., 1947; Ph.D., 1950), where he became devoted to neo-Aristotelian critical methods while studying with R.S. Crane. He taught at Haverford College in Pennsylvania and Earlham College in Indiana before joining the faculty at the University of Chicago in 1962; he retired as professor emeritus in 1992.
In his influential first book, The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961; rev. ed., 1983), Booth presented a detailed examination of narrative technique and introduced such terms as “implied author” and “reliable narrator.” In 1974 he produced Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent, a plea for reasoned assent in the educational community that was prompted by events on the Chicago campus. The Company We Keep (1988) offers a discussion of the place of ethics in literary criticism. In addition to writing further works of criticism, Booth cofounded (1974) and coedited from 1974 to 1985 the quarterly Critical Inquiry. His other books include Now Don’t Try to Reason with Me: Essays and Ironies for a Credulous Age (1970), A Rhetoric of Irony (1974), Critical Understanding: The Powers and Limits of Pluralism (1979), The Vocation of a Teacher (1988), and The Rhetoric of Rhetoric (2004).
