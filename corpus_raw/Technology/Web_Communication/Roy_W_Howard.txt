Roy W. Howard, in full Roy Wilson Howard,  (born Jan. 1, 1883, Gano, Ohio, U.S.â€”died  Nov. 20, 1964, New York, N.Y.), American journalist and editor who was codirector of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain from 1925, when the Scripps-Howard name replaced the original designation, Scripps-McRae. Howard directed Scripps-Howard as the surviving partner after the death in 1938 of Robert Scripps. By that time, partly owing to the Great Depression, the number of Scripps-Howard newspapers had been reduced from 25 to 20.
Howard was the son of a railroad brakeman who died early, and he was obliged to work to help support the family. He got a job as a cub reporter on the Indianapolis News, where he worked his way up to full reporter, and he eventually moved to the Cincinnati Post, which was owned by Edward W. Scripps. Howard became news editor there, and then a correspondent for the Scripps-McRae News Service in 1906. Scripps-McRae purchased the Publishers Press Association, a news agency, and Howard was named to manage the association. When it was consolidated into the United Press (UP) agency in 1907, Howard became its vice president and general manager. As president of UP from 1912, he greatly expanded that news agency and also interviewed many leading European political figures. In 1918, reporting from Europe, he broke the news of the World War I Armistice four days early, a scoop that caused considerable controversy. As chairman of the board of Scripps-Howard from 1921 to 1936, he was active in acquiring new papers for that newspaper chain, and he sought editorial balance for it by making it his practice to hire columnists with divergent views. He was president of Scripps-Howard from 1936 to 1952.
