May Swenson,  (born May 28, 1919, Logan, Utah, U.S.—died Dec. 4, 1989, Ocean View, Del.), American poet whose work is noted for its engaging imagery, intricate wordplay, and eccentric use of typography. Her poetry has been compared to that of Emily Dickinson, Elizabeth Bishop, Marianne Moore, and George Herbert.
Swenson was educated at Utah State University (B.A., 1939). She later moved to New York City and worked for New Directions Press as a stenographer and editor. She was writer in residence at several North American universities.
Her first published volume of poetry, Another Animal (1954), also appeared in Poets of Today in 1954. Swenson demonstrated her visual inventiveness in Iconographs (1970), a book of verse arranged in typographical forms whose shapes reflect the subject matter of the poems (see example).
Swenson’s other verse collections include A Cage of Spines (1958), To Mix with Time (1963), Poems to Solve (1966), More Poems to Solve (1971), New & Selected Things Taking Place (1978), and In Other Words (1987). Half Sun, Half Sleep (1967) contains new work and her translations of poetry by six Swedish authors. With Leif Sjoberg, Swenson translated from the Swedish Windows and Stones, Selected Poems of Tomas Tranströmer (1972). Her own poetry is widely anthologized, and a collection entitled Nature: Poems Old and New (1994) was published posthumously.
