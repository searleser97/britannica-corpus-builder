Sir Denis Hamilton, in full Sir Charles Denis Hamilton,  (born Dec. 6, 1918, South Shields, Durham [now Tyne and Wear], Eng.—died  April 7, 1988, London), British newspaper editor who led the postwar campaign for broader media coverage and more innovative journalism.
After serving on Field Marshal B.L. Montgomery’s staff during World War II, Hamilton worked as the personal assistant to the British newspaper magnate Lord Kemsley (1946–50) and as editorial director of Kemsley Newspapers Ltd. (1950–58), which owned The Sunday Times. When Kemsley sold the business to the Canadian publisher Roy Thomson (1959), Hamilton remained on the staff and became editor of The Sunday Times in 1961. Hamilton recruited talented young reporters, allowed his senior editors almost unlimited freedom, encouraged investigative reporting, expanded business coverage, and added the first colour Sunday supplement in the country.
When Thomson bought The Times in 1967, Hamilton became editor in chief of both newspapers and chief executive of Times Newspapers Ltd. Thomson ceased publication of the newspapers for almost a year when Hamilton was unable to overcome union resistance to modernization in 1978. Hamilton resigned in 1981 after Thomson sold the newspapers to Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch. Hamilton was a trustee of the British Museum (from 1969) and chairman of the news service Reuters Ltd. (1979–85). He was knighted in 1976.
