Emoticon,  glyph used in computer-mediated communications that is meant to represent a facial expression in order to communicate the emotional state of the author. When the Internet was entirely text-based, between the late 1960s and the early 1990s, emoticons were rendered in ASCII and were read sideways, as the “smiley” :-) indicates. The word emoticon comes from a contraction of the words emotional icon.
Although it has been claimed that the first emoticon appeared in 1979, the first substantiated use of an emoticon came from American computer scientist Scott E. Fahlman on September 19,1982. He suggested that :-) could indicate humorous posts on a message board and :-( could indicate serious posts.
The use of emoticons has caused controversy online. Critics of emoticons argue that they erode the ability of people to communicate clearly and use language creatively in cyberspace, as well as in other forms of writing. Some have said that they are a lazy means of communication. Others note that they negatively affect the credibility of the author in an e-mail message.
Emoticon supporters insist, however, that they help online communication more than they hurt it. At their most basic level, emoticons are perhaps the crudest attempts to address the issue of emotion and feelings among users in computer environments in the absence of the high-bandwidth capacities of live face-to-face contact. They stand in for nonverbal communication in text and e-mail communication and clarify the tone of the message without the need for lengthy exposition.
