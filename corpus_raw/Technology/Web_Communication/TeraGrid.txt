TeraGrid,  American integrated network of supercomputing centres joined for high-performance computing. TeraGrid, the worldâ€™s largest and fastest distributed infrastructure for general scientific research, also maintains a network link with DEISA, a European supercomputing network that has grown to rival the American network in speed and storage capacity.
In 2001 the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded $45 million to create the Distributed Terascale Facility network linking Argonne National Laboratory, the Center for Advanced Computing Research at the California Institute of Technology, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at the University of California. Over the next few years, the NSF expanded the network, renamed the TeraGrid, to include more supercomputing centres.
TeraGrid is coordinated through the University of Chicago (which also operates Argonne National Laboratory) and now includes 11 partners: Argonne, Indiana University, Louisiana Optical Network Initiative (a network between various research universities in Louisiana and Mississippi), National Center for Atmospheric Research, NCSA, National Institute for Computational Sciences at the University of Tennessee, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center at Carnegie Mellon University, Purdue University, SDSC, and the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas.
