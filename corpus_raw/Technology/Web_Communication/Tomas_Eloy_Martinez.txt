From 1969 to 1970 he served as a reporter in Paris, and from 1970 to 1972 he was the director of the magazine Panorama. For three years (1972–75) Martínez was in charge of the cultural supplement of La Nación, after which he lived in exile (1975–83) in Caracas, Venez., where he remained active as a journalist, founding the newspaper El Diario de Caracas. He subsequently started the newspaper Siglo 21 in Guadalajara, Mex., and created the literary supplement Primer Plano for the newspaper Página/12 in Buenos Aires. After gaining acclaim as a novelist, he became a prolific columnist for La Nación, El País in Spain, and The New York Times, which syndicated his articles to some 200 newspapers in Latin America and Europe.
Martínez is best known as the author of two classics of Argentine and Latin American literature: La novela de Perón (1985) and Santa Evita (1995); the latter was translated into 30 languages and sold more than 10 million copies. In 2002 Martínez was awarded the prestigious Alfaguara Prize for his novel El vuelo de la reina. His other novels include Sagrado (1969), La mano del amo (1991), and Purgatorio (2008).
