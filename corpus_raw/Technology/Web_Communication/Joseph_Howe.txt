Joseph Howe,  (born December 13, 1804, Halifax, Nova Scotia [Canada]—died  June 1, 1873, Halifax, Nova Scotia), Canadian statesman and newspaper publisher, premier of Nova Scotia in 1860–63, agitator for responsible, or cabinet, government for Nova Scotia, and opponent of Confederation of the British North American provinces.
In 1827 Howe started a weekly nonpolitical journal, the Acadian. The following year he purchased the Nova Scotian, which, when later incorporated with the Morning Chronicle, became one of the leading newspapers in British North America.
In 1836 Howe was elected member for Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the provincial assembly. He was included in the executive council from 1840 until his resignation in 1843. He campaigned for responsible government for Nova Scotia in his newspaper and criticized the lieutenant governor, Lord Falkland; he helped bring about Falkland’s resignation in 1848, and responsible government was finally conceded that year. In 1854 Howe was appointed chief commissioner of railways for Nova Scotia. He became premier of the province in 1860 and opposed federation. He retired from provincial politics in 1863 and took the post of imperial fishery commissioner (1863–66).
After leading the antifederation forces in Nova Scotia and going to Great Britain in 1866–67 to try to repeal the British North America Act, which created the Dominion of Canada, Howe finally accepted the accomplished fact and was elected to the Canadian Parliament for Hants. He joined the cabinet of Sir John Macdonald as president of the council and then secretary of state. In May 1873 he was appointed lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia, but he died three weeks later.
