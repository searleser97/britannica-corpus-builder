hard disk, also called hard disk drive or hard drive,  magnetic storage medium for a computer. Hard disks are flat circular plates made of aluminum or glass and coated with a magnetic material. Hard disks for personal computers can store terabytes (trillions of bytes) of information. Data are stored on their surfaces in concentric tracks. A small electromagnet, called a magnetic head, writes a binary digit (1 or 0) by magnetizing tiny spots on the spinning disk in different directions and reads digits by detecting the magnetization direction of the spots. A computer’s hard drive is a device consisting of several hard disks, read/write heads, a drive motor to spin the disks, and a small amount of circuitry, all sealed in a metal case to protect the disks from dust. In addition to referring to the disks themselves, the term hard disk is also used to refer to the whole of a computer’s internal data storage. Beginning in the early 21st century, some personal computers and laptops were produced that used solid-state drives (SSDs) that relied on flash memory chips instead of hard disks to store information.
