Emir Rodríguez Monegal,  (born July 28, 1921, Melo, Uruguay—died November 14, 1985, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.), professor, editor, and cultural promoter who was one of the most influential Latin American literary critics of the 20th century. He published books on key literary figures such as Jorge Luis Borges, Pablo Neruda, Andrés Bello, Horacio Quiroga, and José Enrique Rodó, and he was the editor of the literary section of Marcha, a Montevideo weekly, from 1945 to 1957. Between 1966 and 1968 Rodríguez Monegal was editor of Mundo Nuevo, a Spanish-language literary journal published in Paris that brought international attention to the writers who made up what came to be known as the “boom of the Latin American novel”: Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa, José Donoso, and others. He also helped launch the careers of younger writers such as Guillermo Cabrera Infante, Severo Sarduy, and Manuel Puig.
Rodríguez Monegal was one of the first Latin American critics to recognize the value of Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, about whom he wrote throughout his career, a work that culminated in his Jorge Luis Borges: A Literary Biography (1978). He also published books about the life and works of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, El viajero inmóvil: Introducción a Pablo Neruda (1966; “The Immobile Traveler: An Introduction to Pablo Neruda”); fellow Uruguayan Horacio Quiroga, El desterrado: Vida y obra de Horacio Quiroga (1968; “The Exile: Life and Work of Horacio Quiroga”); and Venezuelan Andrés Bello, El otro Andrés Bello (1969; “The Other Andrés Bello”).
A political scandal concerning the funding for Mundo Nuevo, which was alleged to include money from the CIA, brought to an end Rodríguez Monegal’s tenure as editor of the journal in 1968. In 1969 he was appointed professor of Latin American literature at Yale University, where he remained until his death. While in the United States he edited The Borzoi Anthology of Latin American Literature (1977), wrote his biography of Borges, and was active in promoting the study of Latin American literature in American universities.
