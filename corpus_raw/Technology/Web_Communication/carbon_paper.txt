Carbon paper,  a tissue of varying weight coated with a colour, generally carbon black, and some waxy medium. It is usually coated on one side but may be coated on both sides for special purposes. For duplication of typewritten or hand-printed documents, it is coated on one side only.
The paper upon which the coating is applied varies in weight from 4 to 10 pounds (1.8 to 4.5 kg) per ream of 480 sheets, 20 by 30 inches (51 by 76 cm), and is made from fibres such as rag, wood, manila, and jute. Since it must be strong and durable, it must not contain any ground wood pulp. The coloured waxy material that transmits the duplication is soft but also so strongly coloured and of such durability that a sheet will make at least 12 first copies that are clear and legible. This coating is composed of waxes such as Japan, paraffin, and carnauba and such oils as olein and rosin thoroughly amalgamated with a colour.
