Hydrophone,   device for converting sound waves into electrical signals, similar in operation to a microphone but used primarily for detecting sound waves from an underwater source, such as a submarine. Usually an array of hydrophones is employed to pinpoint the source: the array is connected to an electrical circuit that permits the phase differences of the sound waves at the various hydrophones to be compensated electrically. Thus, the whole array can be “steered” in the direction of the sound source without actual motion of the hydrophones.
