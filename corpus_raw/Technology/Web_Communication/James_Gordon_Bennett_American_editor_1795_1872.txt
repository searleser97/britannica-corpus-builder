James Gordon Bennett,  (born Sept. 1, 1795, Newmill, Banffshire, Scot.—died  June 1, 1872, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Scottish-born American editor who shaped many of the methods of modern journalism.
Bennett immigrated to America in the spring of 1819 and eventually settled in New York City, where he founded a school, gave lectures on political economy, and did subordinate work for the journals. During the next 10 years he was employed on various papers. He was the Washington, D.C., correspondent of the New York Enquirer and associate editor of the Morning Courier and New York Enquirer, his articles attracting much attention. He founded the short-lived Globe in New York City in 1832, and in 1833–34 he was the chief editor and one of the proprietors of The Pennsylvanian at Philadelphia.
With a capital of $500 he published on May 6, 1835, the first number of a four-page penny paper bearing the title of The New York Herald and issuing from a cellar. By his industry and sagacity he made the paper a great commercial success. He devoted attention particularly to the gathering of news and was the first to introduce many of the methods of modern news reporting. He published on June 13, 1835, the first Wall Street financial article to appear in any American newspaper; printed a vivid and detailed account of the great fire of December 1835 in New York; was the first, in 1838, to establish correspondents in Europe; was the first, in 1846, to obtain the report in full by telegraph of a long political speech; maintained during the Civil War a staff of 63 war correspondents; was a leader in the use of illustrations; introduced a society department; and, with the Helen Jewett case (1836), was the first in American journalism to publish an account of a love-nest murder.
