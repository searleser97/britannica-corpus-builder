Broadband technology,  telecommunications devices, lines, or technologies that allow communication over a wide band of frequencies, and especially over a range of frequencies divided into multiple independent channels for the simultaneous transmission of different signals. Broadband systems allow voice, data, and video to be broadcast over the same medium at the same time. They may also allow multiple data channels to be broadcast simultaneously. In the context of Internet access, the term broadband has come to mean Internet speeds faster than those that could be achieved through dial-up.
