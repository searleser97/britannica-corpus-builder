John Bartholomew and Son,  former mapmaking and publishing company of the United Kingdom that was located in Edinburgh and specialized in the use of hypsometric (layer) colouring in relief maps.
The company was established in 1826 by John Bartholomew (1805–61). It originally published such diverse items as checkbooks, election literature, and maps. In 1856 his son John Bartholomew (1831–93), the well-known Scottish cartographer, assumed control of the management, and the company developed into a larger, more prosperous business and acquired its own printing press (1860). He was succeeded by his son John George Bartholomew (1860–1920). After 1890 production was devoted mainly to cartographical publications. The company’s much-acclaimed Environmental Map Programme for Education, using satellite photography to study the Earth’s environment and physical features, was launched in 1978. Some of the company’s well-known publications were its World Travel Map Series, World Atlas, Times World Wall Map, National Map Series, and City Plans Series. Through much of the 20th century the company was overseen in various capacities by other members of the Bartholomew family: John (Ian) Bartholomew (1890–1962), son of John George; and John Christopher Bartholomew (1923–2008), Peter Hugh Bartholomew (1924–87), and Robert Gordon Bartholomew (born 1927), all sons of Ian. After a succession of corporate owners in the 1980s, the company was absorbed in 1989 by what would become the publisher HarperCollins.
