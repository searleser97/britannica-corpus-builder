Max Lerner, in full Maxwell Alan Lerner, original name Mikhail Lerner,  (born Dec. 20, 1902, Minsk, Russia—died  June 5, 1992, New York, N.Y., U.S.), American educator, author, and syndicated columnist who was an influential spokesman for liberal political and economic views.
Lerner immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1907. He graduated from Yale University (B.A., 1923), where he later studied law, before attending Washington University, St. Louis, Mo. (M.A., 1925), and the Robert Brookings Graduate School of Economics and Government, Washington, D.C. (Ph.D., 1927). He was editor of the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences (1927–32), the magazine The Nation (1936–38), and PM (1943–48), which was a New York City newspaper with no advertising. From 1949 he was a widely read and often controversial syndicated columnist for the New York Post. He contributed articles to many magazines, including The Atlantic, The New Republic, and Saturday Review. His long teaching career, largely in government and political science, included appointments at Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, N.Y.; Harvard University; Williams College, Williamstown, Mass.; and Brandeis University, Waltham, Mass. Throughout his life Lerner advocated the right of Soviet and Eastern European Jews to emigrate to Israel. Lerner’s last book, Wrestling with the Angel (1990), described his struggle with a long series of illnesses.
