Oscar Sonneck, in full Oscar George Theodore Sonneck,  (born Oct. 6, 1873, Jersey City, N.J., U.S.—died  Oct. 30, 1928, New York City), American musicologist, librarian, and editor.
Sonneck was mainly educated in Germany and attended the universities of Heidelberg and Munich, studying philosophy, composition, conducting, and, especially, musicology.
A significant portion of his studies on American musical life before 1800—an area of study that remained his lifelong interest—was carried out at the new Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. In 1902 he was appointed the first head of the library’s music division, in which capacity he organized and developed one of the finest and most comprehensive collections of music, manuscripts, and books on music in the world.
In 1917 he resigned from the library and accepted the post of director of the publication department of G. Schirmer, Inc. (New York City), whose Musical Quarterly he had edited since its first issue in 1915. After his appointment as vice-president of the company (1921), he actively supported American composers and directed the publication of new music by Ernest Bloch, John Alden Carpenter, Charles Tomlinson Griffes, Rubin Goldmark, Charles Martin Loeffler, and others.
Sonneck’s writings laid the foundation for the scientific study of music in the United States. His elaborate catalogs (issued by the Library of Congress) and his work on opera librettos remain the outstanding reference works in their field, and the system he devised for the classification of music collections is an invaluable contribution to music bibliography.
