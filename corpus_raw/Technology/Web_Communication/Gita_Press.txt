Gita Press,  Hinduism’s largest printer, publisher, and distributor of religious literature. Envisaged as the Hindu equivalent of a Christian Bible society, Gita Press was established on April 29, 1923, in the town of Gorakhpur by altruistic businessmen under the direction of Jayadayal Goyandka (1885–1965), who was joined several years later by Hanumanprasad Poddar (1892–1971). This nonprofit organization made nominally priced copies of Hindu sacred texts accessible on an unprecedented scale, with “neutral,” simple-to-follow translations, abridgments, and commentaries written in the Hindi vernacular. The Gita Press’s religious-text publication program has been the version of the Hindu canon most widely available in India during the past fifty years.
Distributed through Gita Press stores, mobile vans, and public outlets, the press’s texts gained an established familiarity as sources of important textual material and as objects to be handled in prescribed, ritualistic ways. By the closing years of the 20th century, the press had published some 48 million copies of the Rāmcaritmānas; 40 million copies of the Bhagavad Gītā. 15 million copies of Hindu classics such as the Purāṇas and Upanishads; as well as a staggering 147 million scripture-based booklets, pamphlets, and tracts dealing with various topics relating to spiritual growth. These were written mostly by Poddar, Goyandka, and the present head trustee of the press, Swami Ramsukhdas (b. 1912).
The magazine Kalyāṇ, founded by Poddar in 1926, is perhaps one of Gita Press’s best-known publications. The most widely read religious periodical ever published in India, Kalyāṇ currently has over 230,000 subscribers and an estimated pass-on rate of 10 times that figure. As such, the magazine remains at the forefront of populist efforts to proclaim Hindu solidarity (saṅgāṭhan), pious self-identity, and “normative” cultural values.
