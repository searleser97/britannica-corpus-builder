streaming,  method of transmitting a media file in a continuous stream of data that can be processed by the receiving computer before the entire file has been completely sent. Streaming, which typically uses data compression, is especially effective for downloading large multimedia files from the Internet; it permits, for example, a video clip to begin playing on a userâ€™s computer as soon as it begins to be downloaded from a website. Even with improved modems and connection speeds, downloading and playing large audio and video files without the use of streaming techniques still takes an inconveniently long time. To accept streaming data, the receiving computer needs to be running a player, a program that decompresses the incoming data and sends the resulting signals to the display and speakers. The audio and video files may be prerecorded, but streaming can also accommodate a live feed over the Internet. In the early 21st century, both personal computers and computer networks became fast enough to accommodate large streaming video files, and more than 70 percent of Internet traffic was streaming video, often on subscription services like Netflix and Amazon Prime.
