IBM OS/2, in full International Business Machines Operating System/2,  an operating system introduced in 1987 by IBM and the Microsoft Corporation to operate the second-generation line of IBM personal computers, the PS/2 (Personal System/2).
IBM OS/2 was intended to replace the older disk operating system (DOS), which, with the development of the Intel Corporation 80286 microchips in the mid-1980s, was growing increasingly obsolete. OS/2 combined a new graphical user interface (GUI) with features previously available only on mainframe computers. It shared similarities with other personal computer (PC) operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, UNIX, and Xenix.
Simultaneously, Microsoft continued development of its Windows operating system, whose popular third iteration (Windows 3.0) contained some of the GUI elements developed for OS/2. Despite later basing some Windows NT and Windows 95 developments on code written for IBM and OS/2, Microsoft soon discontinued development of further interface features for OS/2.
With Microsoft focusing its efforts on Windows, IBM turned to Commodore Business Machines for interface development and borrowed GUI design ideas from the Commodore AmigaOS. With OS/2.20 the WorkPlace Shell was created and became a GUI standard, and future OS/2 iterations ran Windows with a reliability that led IBM to label the system “crash proof.”
In 1994 IBM introduced a new version, OS/2 Warp, which included many new features. OS/2, however, failed to acquire a share of the mass market. It survived in IBM-dominated niche markets such as automated teller machines (ATMs), but the company halted production in 2005 and support in 2006. Users and developers still loyal to OS/2 support releasing the software as open source, but Microsoft retains rights to some of the code, and the security of ATMs could be compromised.
