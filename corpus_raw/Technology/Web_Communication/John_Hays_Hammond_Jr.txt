John Hays Hammond, Jr.,  (born April 13, 1888, San Francisco—died  Feb. 12, 1965, New York City), U.S. inventor whose development of radio remote control served as the basis for modern missile guidance systems.
Son of the noted U.S. mining engineer John Hays Hammond, he established the Hammond Radio Research Laboratory in 1911. By the beginning of World War I, he had not only developed radio remote control but also incorporated it with a gyroscope to send an experimental yacht on a 120-mile (190-kilometre) round trip between Gloucester, Mass., and Boston. Hammond then developed techniques for preventing enemy jamming of remote control and invented a radio-controlled torpedo for coastal defense.
Hammond conducted some of the earliest experiments in frequency modulation (FM) broadcasting and invented single-dial radio tuning. In addition he devised an amplifier that was used on long-distance telephone lines.
During World War II he developed a variable-pitch ship propeller that increased engine efficiency. His later developments include a method of intelligence transmission called “Telespot.” He was president of the Hammond Research Corporation, a consulting firm, and often served as research consultant to large corporations.
