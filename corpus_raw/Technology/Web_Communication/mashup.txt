Mashup,  a combination of multiple data formats or sources, such as maps, music, photographs, video, and animations, into one digital file. Mashup originally referred to combinations of sampled music from different songs.
Google Earth, from the American search engine company Google Inc., is one of the most frequently used tools for creating mashups. The software service makes it easy to combine detailed satellite images of the Earthâ€™s surface with user-supplied data such as population densities, weather patterns, restaurant locations, or other information. As mashups have permeated Internet culture, companies such as Yahoo!, IBM, and the Microsoft Corporation have tried to make mashup software simpler to use.
