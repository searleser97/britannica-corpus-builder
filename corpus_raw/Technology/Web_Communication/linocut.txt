Linocut, also called linoleum cut,  type of print made from a sheet of linoleum into which a design has been cut in relief. This process of printmaking is similar to woodcut, but, since linoleum lacks a grain, linocuts can yield a greater variety of effects than woodcuts can. Linocut designs can be cut in large masses, engraved to give supple white lines, or worked in numerous ways to achieve many different textures. The ease with which linoleum is worked makes it admirably suited to large decorative prints, using broad areas of flat colour.
The linocut process, introduced in the beginning of the 20th century, was long disdained by many artists as not sufficiently demanding of technical skill. The artists of the Taller de Gráfica Popular (People’s Graphics Workshop), a printmaking workshop founded in Mexico City in 1937, made effective use of the linocut in their powerful graphic posters. After Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse used the technique to advantage in the 1950s, many other artists adopted it.
