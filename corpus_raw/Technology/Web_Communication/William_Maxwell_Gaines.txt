William Maxwell Gaines,  (born March 1, 1922, New York, New York, U.S.—died June 3, 1992, New York City), American publisher who launched Mad magazine (1952), an irreverent monthly with humorous illustrations and writing that satirized mass media, politicians, celebrities, and comic books.
Gaines served in the U.S. Army during World War II, which interrupted his studies at New York University (B.S., 1948). He inherited EC (Educational Comics) after his father died in 1947 and pioneered the horror-comic genre, restyling the company name to mean Entertaining Comics. He and cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman created Mad at a time when distributors refused to stock his publications, prompted by a 1954 Senate inquiry on the influence on youth of violent comic books that resulted in the adoption of a standards code. The magazine was represented by a foolish-looking gap-toothed cover boy, the fictional Alfred E. Neuman, whose motto “What, me worry?” became the catchphrase of teenage readers. From 1956 Neuman was a write-in candidate in every presidential election, and Gaines once hung a Neuman campaign poster from the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy. At the peak of its popularity, Mad, which carried no advertising, had a yearly circulation of 2.4 million, a figure that declined to about 500,000 at the end of the 20th century. Gaines remained the publisher of Mad even after the magazine was acquired by Kinney National Service Corporation (later Warner Communications) in 1968.
