Histogram, orbar graph,  Graph using vertical or horizontal bars whose lengths indicate quantities. Along with the pie chart, the histogram is the most common format for representing statistical data. Its advantage is that it not only clearly shows the largest and smallest categories but gives an immediate impression of the distribution of the data. In fact, a histogram is a representation of a frequency distribution.
