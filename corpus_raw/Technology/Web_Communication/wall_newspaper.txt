Wall newspaper,  newspaper produced for display on walls or in other prominent places in cities, towns, and villages, usually in developing countries. The practice is not new; in ancient Rome the Acta newspapers were regularly posted. Wall newspapers may serve a single population centre or several; they have been published by governmental agencies where newspapers are too costly to produce and distribute or where people are too poor to buy them. Usually, a single individual in a given locality has the responsibility of affixing the wall newspaper in a specified place—on a schoolhouse, community centre, or other easily accessible wall or display board. The same person or another may read the paper aloud to others who are illiterate.
Wall newspapers have been widely used in Asia, Africa, and South and Central America, and, where necessary, they are printed in various regional or local dialects. The papers generally feature numerous pictures, attractive makeup, and only a few—sometimes only one or two—articles or features.
