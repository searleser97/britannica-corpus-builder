Ridgely Torrence, in full Frederic Ridgely Torrence,  (born Nov. 27, 1874, Xenia, Ohio, U.S.—died  Dec. 25, 1950, New York City), U.S. poet and playwright who wrote some of the first serious, accurate dramas of black life.
Torrence first became known as a poet with publication of The House of a Hundred Lights (1900). He sought to refresh American theatre with verse dramas, such as El Dorado: A Tragedy (1903), but although they were published as books, they never made it to the stage. The performance of his one-act prose play Granny Maumee (1914)—part of Plays for a Negro Theatre (1917)—was, however, instrumental in opening up American theatre to black actors. The play was originally performed with a white cast, but for the 1917 performance a black cast was collected, providing one of the first opportunities for serious black actors.
Though Torrence did not write enough to be very influential, his work is notable for blending strength and compassion. His poetry, including Poems (1941), is written in a well-crafted, musical idiom.
Torrence was poetry editor of New Republic (1920–33). He also organized the National Survey of the Negro Theater (1939).
