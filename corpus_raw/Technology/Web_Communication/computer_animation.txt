computer animation, also called computer-generated imagery (CGI),  form of animated graphics using computers that replaced both “stop-motion” animation of scale-model puppets and hand-drawn animation of drawings. Efforts to lessen the labour and costs of animation have led to simplification and computerization. Computers can be used in every step of sophisticated animation—for example, to automate the movement of the rostrum camera or to supply the in-between drawings for full animation. When a three-dimensional figure is translated into computer terms (digitized), the computer can generate and display a sequence of images that seem to move or rotate the object through space. Hence, computer animation can simulate highly complex motion for medical and other scientific researchers as well as for feature films.
