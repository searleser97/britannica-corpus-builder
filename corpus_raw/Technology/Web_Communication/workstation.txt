Workstation,  a high-performance computer system that is basically designed for a single user and has advanced graphics capabilities, large storage capacity, and a powerful central processing unit. A workstation is more capable than a personal computer (PC) but is less advanced than a server (which can manage a large network of peripheral PCs or workstations and handle immense data-processing and reporting tasks). The term workstation was also sometimes ascribed to dumb terminals (i.e., those without any processing capacity) that were connected to mainframe computers.
Their raw processing power allows high-end workstations to accommodate high-resolution or three-dimensional graphic interfaces, sophisticated multitask software, and advanced abilities to communicate with other computers. Workstations are used primarily to perform computationally intensive scientific and engineering tasks. They have also found favour in some complex financial and business applications. In addition, high-end workstations often serve a network of attached “client” PCs, which use resident tools and applications to access and manipulate data stored on the workstation.
The chief delineation between PCs and workstations has traditionally been the latter’s advanced graphics and data-processing capabilities. But the advanced graphic interfaces and powerful microprocessors of high-end PCs can make them barely distinguishable from low-end workstations.
