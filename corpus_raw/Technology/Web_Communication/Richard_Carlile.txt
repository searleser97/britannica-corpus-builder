Richard Carlile,  (born December 8, 1790, Ashburton, Devonshire, England—died February 10, 1843, London), Radical English journalist who was a notable champion of the freedom of the press. Although convinced that the free propagation of ideas was more important than specific reforms, he was an early advocate of almost all the Radical causes of his time, including the abolition of monarchy, completely secular education, and the emancipation of women.
Carlile, a shoemaker’s son, became a journeyman tinsmith in London in 1813. Influenced by the humanitarian Thomas Paine’s “Rights of Man” and dismayed by the economic depression of 1817, he began a new career as a salesman of two Radical weeklies, The Black Dwarf and (William) Sherwin’s Weekly Political Register. After Sherwin gave him control of his printing press in 1817, Carlile published several Radical and Deistic writings, among them his own Political Litany. For publishing Paine’s works he was tried in 1819, heavily fined, and sentenced to a three-year term of imprisonment, which was extended to six years for nonpayment of the fine.
He had become sole proprietor of Sherwin’s weekly journal that same year (1819), and, changing its name to The Republican, he edited 12 volumes in prison. Curiously, the government made no attempt to stop his editorial work in jail, though his wife, sister, and other persons who operated his printing shop were harassed by police and at times imprisoned.
Carlile was released from prison in 1825 but was later jailed again for refusing to pay fines. He subsequently edited two more volumes of The Republican and two new weeklies, The Gorgon and The Lion. From 1829 to 1831 he led discussions in the London Rotunda, which became the centre of Radical and freethinking activities. In total, Carlile spent more than nine years in prison.
