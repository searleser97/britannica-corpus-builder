Émile de Girardin,  (born June 21, 1806, Paris—died  April 27, 1881, Paris), popular French journalist, called the Napoleon of the press for his success in publishing inexpensive newspapers with massive circulations.
The illegitimate son of Count Alexandre de Girardin by the wife of a Parisian lawyer, he took his father’s name upon the publication of his first work, an autobiographical novel Émile (1827). In 1828 he founded his first periodical, Le Voleur, a monthly review of arts and science, and soon became an important figure in Parisian society, marrying, in 1831, the writer Delphine Gay. His reputation was enlarged by numerous other publishing successes—including an atlas, an almanac, and several journals—and he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1834.
Girardin’s great triumph, however, was the founding of La Presse (1836), a basically conservative newspaper that sold for less than half the cost of competing newspapers. Through excellent publicity, the paper attained a large circulation and became profitable.
After a private and political dispute with Armand Carrel, publisher of the journal Nationale, Girardin killed Carrel in a duel (July 22, 1836), and his popularity declined for several years. He was excluded from the Chamber of Deputies in 1839 because his nationality was in some dispute, and, even though his French birth was established within a few weeks, he was not reelected to the chamber until 1842.
Girardin’s political attitudes shifted with changes in public opinion; he was a middle-class conservative who occasionally showed progressive tendencies. In 1848 he advised Louis-Philippe to abdicate and hand over the regency to the Duchess of Orleans. At first he supported the Second Republic, but after the risings of June 1848 he declared his support for Louis-Napoléon. His waverings persisted under the Second Empire. After six years away from La Presse, he returned in 1862, joined the liberal party, and urged war against Prussia. In 1866 he revived an obscure journal, La Liberté. Several years later he became a Republican, bought the Petit Journal (1872), and increased its circulation to 500,000; in 1874 he also became political editor of La France. Both journals played a great part in the Republican triumph in the elections of 1877.
