data transmission,  sending and receiving data via cables (e.g., telephone lines or fibre optics) or wireless systems.
Because ordinary telephone circuits pass signals that fall within the frequency range of voice communication (about 300â€“3,500 hertz), the high frequencies associated with data transmission suffer a loss of amplitude and transmission speed. Data signals must therefore be translated into a format compatible with the signals used in telephone lines. Digital computers use a modem to transform outgoing digital electronic data, and a similar system at the receiving end translates the incoming signal back to the original electronic data.
For data transmission over cable lines, which can transfer data at a much higher rate than that of ordinary telephone circuits, a cable modem is used that modulates and demodulates signals like a telephone modem but is a much more complex device. Once data have arrived at the modem in a home or business, they are often transmitted wirelessly from a router to other devices, such as personal computers or televisions.
Portable devices such as smartphones and tablet computers receive data wirelessly, either over the networks used for cellular phones or over short-range networks using Wi-Fi. See also broadband technology; cable modem; DSL; ISDN; fax; radio; teletype; T1; wireless communications.
