Lincoln Kirstein, in full Lincoln Edward Kirstein,  (born May 4, 1907, Rochester, N.Y., U.S.—died  Jan. 5, 1996, New York, N.Y.), American dance authority, impresario, writer, and businessman who collaborated with George Balanchine to found and direct the various ballet companies that eventually became the world-renowned New York City Ballet (directed by Kirstein from 1948 to 1989). Kirstein also helped establish the School of American Ballet, which he directed from 1940 to 1989.
Kirstein was born into a wealthy family. His aesthetic leanings were displayed early. While a student at Harvard University (B.S., 1930), he founded and edited (1927–34) a literary magazine, Hound and Horn, whose contributors included T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and E.E. Cummings. Financially independent, Kirstein decided to devote his life to the support and promotion of the arts.
His artistic interests, which were always diverse, soon focused on ballet. He helped Romola Nijinska write the biography of her famous husband, Vaslav Nijinsky, and it was he who, in 1933, persuaded a young choreographer in Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, George Balanchine, to come to the United States, thus beginning an artistic collaboration that ended only with Balanchine’s death (1983). In 1934 Kirstein and Balanchine founded the School of American Ballet, with Balanchine as artistic director and Kirstein as director of theatrical sciences; in 1940 Kirstein became the school’s director. During the next decade the two founded several ballet companies that, while short-lived, had a profound effect on ballet in the United States. In 1934 they founded the American Ballet, with Balanchine as choreographer. Kirstein, an established author, wrote the librettos for several ballets (e.g., Transcendence and Billy the Kid). He also founded (1936) and directed Ballet Caravan, an ensemble of dancers recruited from the American Ballet and the school. In 1941 the Ballet Caravan merged briefly with the American Ballet, and then the combined company disbanded.
After serving in World War II, Kirstein returned to New York City and cofounded another dance troupe, Ballet Society (1946), with Balanchine as artistic director. In 1948 this troupe gave the premiere of Igor Stravinsky’s Orpheus (choreography by Balanchine), which is considered a landmark of modern dance. Kirstein and Balanchine then transformed the Ballet Society into the New York City Ballet, which became the most influential and innovative ballet company in the United States. From its founding (1948), Balanchine was its artistic director (until 1983) and Kirstein was its general director (until 1989).
Kirstein’s literary output was prolific and eclectic. His works on dance include Dance (1935), a standard reference work; The Classic Ballet (1952; with Muriel Stuart); Movement and Metaphor (1970); The New York City Ballet (1973); Nijinsky Dancing (1975); and Thirty Years with the New York City Ballet (1978). From 1942 to 1948 he edited Dance Index, a magazine that published scholarly, illustrated, and annotated monographs on the entire spectrum of dance topics. In bound form (seven volumes), Dance Index became a major reference work for dance scholars. Kirstein also published poetry, plays, novels, memoirs, and critical studies on the visual arts, motion pictures, music, and literature.
