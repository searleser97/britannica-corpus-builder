Didot Family,  family of French printers, publishers, and typefounders who had a profound influence on the history of typography in France.
The founder of the family business was François Didot (1689–1757), who began business as a printer and bookseller in Paris in 1713. He was best known for publishing a 20-volume collection of the works of the Abbé Prévost. Didot’s eldest son, François-Ambroise (1730–1804), altered the standard of type design by allowing greater contrast between thick and thin letters. He improved upon the Fournier standard of measurement for punch cutting and mold making; the Didot point system of 72 points to the French inch became the standard unit of type measurement. François-Ambroise also abandoned the use of classical names such as “parisienne” and “petit romain” for type size and instead distinguished types by their size as measured in points (e.g., 12-point or 24-point type). In 1780 he introduced a highly finished wove paper, similar to the kind used by the English typefounder John Baskerville.
François-Ambroise had two sons, Pierre (called Pierre l’aîné; 1761–1853), who took over his father’s printing office, and Firmin (c. 1765–1836), who assumed responsibility for his father’s typefoundry. Pierre published acclaimed editions of Virgil, Horace, La Fontaine, and Racine. Firmin designed the Didot typeface. He also invented stereotypes (plates cast from printing surfaces) and was thus able to publish low-priced editions of French, Italian, and English books. Napoleon appointed him director of the imperial foundry, a position he held until his death.
François Didot’s younger son, Pierre-François (c. 1731–93), was a typefounder, publisher, and papermaker. His three sons also joined the family businesses: Henri (1765–1852) is remembered for his microscopic types. For producing type he invented the Polymatype, which consisted of a long bar of matrices into which hot metal was poured. As many as 200 pieces of type could be cast in one operation. Léger (1767–1829) invented a papermaking machine, and the third son, called Didot le jeune, followed Henri as a typemaker.
Firmin Didot’s sons, Ambroise-Firmin (1790–1876) and Hyacinthe-Firmin (1794–1880), took over his business when he retired. Their most important publishing venture was an edition of the Thesaurus graecae linguae compiled by Henri Estienne (9 vol., 1855–59). Among the many other important works they published were the 200 volumes comprising the Bibliothèque des auteurs grecs, Bibliothèque latine, and Bibliothèque française.
