Lawrence Ferlinghetti, in full Lawrence Monsanto Ferlinghetti,  (born March 24, 1919, Yonkers, New York, U.S.—died February 22, 2021, San Francisco, California), American poet, one of the founders of the Beat movement in San Francisco in the mid-1950s. His City Lights bookshop was an early gathering place of the Beats, and the publishing arm of City Lights was the first to print the Beats’ books of poetry.
Ferlinghetti’s father died shortly before Lawrence was born, his mother was placed in a mental hospital, and a female relative took him to France, where he spent most of his childhood. Later they lived on a Long Island, New York, estate on which she was employed as a governess. Ferlinghetti was a U.S. naval officer during World War II, and he received a B.A. at the University of North Carolina, an M.A. at Columbia University, and a doctorate at the Sorbonne in 1951.
In 1951 Ferlinghetti settled in San Francisco, and in 1953 he opened the City Lights Pocket Book Shop, which quickly became a gathering place for the city’s literary avant-garde. In 1955 Ferlinghetti’s new City Lights press published his verse collection Pictures of the Gone World, which was the first paperback volume of the Pocket Poets series. Allen Ginsberg’s Howl and Other Poems (1956) was originally published as the fourth volume in the series. City Lights Books printed other works by Ginsberg as well as books by Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso, Denise Levertov, William Burroughs, William Carlos Williams, and foreign authors.
Ferlinghetti’s own lucid, good-natured, witty verse was written in a conversational style and was designed to be read aloud; it was popular in coffeehouses and campus auditoriums and struck a responsive chord in disaffected youth. His collection A Coney Island of the Mind (1958), with its notable verse “Autobiography,” became the largest-selling book by any living American poet in the second half of the 20th century. The long poem Tentative Description of a Dinner Given to Promote the Impeachment of President Eisenhower (1958) was also popular. Ferlinghetti’s later poems continued to be politically oriented, as such titles as One Thousand Fearful Words for Fidel Castro (1961), Where Is Vietnam (1965), Tyrannus Nix? (1969), and Who Are We Now? (1976) suggest. Retrospective collections of his poems were published as Endless Life (1981) and These Are My Rivers (1995). In 1988 Ferlinghetti published a short novel, Love in the Days of Rage, about a romance during the student revolution in France in 1968.
A Far Rockaway of the Heart, a sequel to A Coney Island of the Mind, appeared in 1997. Two years later he published What Is Poetry?, a book of prose poetry, which was followed by the collection How to Paint Sunlight (2001) and Americus: Part I (2004), a history of the United States in verse. In Poetry as Insurgent Art (2007), a volume of prose poems, he exhorted a return to the firebrand political poetics of the Beat generation. Time of Useful Consciousness (2012) contains poems analyzing the state of contemporary culture. Some of his meditations on travel were collected as Writing Across the Landscape: Travel Journals 1960–2010 (2015), and a number of his exchanges with Ginsberg were published as I Greet You at the Beginning of a Great Career: The Selected Correspondence of Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg, 1955–1997 (2015). Shortly before his 100th birthday, Ferlinghetti published the autobiographical novel Little Boy (2019).
From 1998 to 2000 Ferlinghetti was poet laureate of San Francisco.
