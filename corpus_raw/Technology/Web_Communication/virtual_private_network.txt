Virtual private network (VPN),  a private computer network deployed over a public telecommunications network, such as the Internet. A VPN typically includes one or more connected corporate intranets, or local area networks (LANs), which users at remote locations can access using a password authentication system. Data encryption is used on communications as they pass through unsecured networks such as the Internet in order to deter cybercriminals from obtaining sensitive corporate data or personal account information. Because remote users can connect to private corporate networks through existing public networks, VPNs allow organizations to operate wide area networks (WANs) without the expense of leasing dedicated telecommunications lines.
