Sir Allen Lane, original name Allen Lane Williams,  (born Sept. 21, 1902, Bristol, Gloucestershire, Eng.—died  July 7, 1970, Northwood, Middlesex), 20th-century pioneer of paperback publishing in England, whose belief in a market for high-quality books at low prices helped to create a new reading public and also led to improved printing and binding techniques.
In 1919 Lane was apprenticed to his uncle, publisher John Lane of The Bodley Head, London, of which he became managing editor on his uncle’s death six years later. Lane left Bodley in 1935 and founded Penguin Books, Ltd., which published Penguin paperback reprints priced at 6 pence (12 cents, U.S.). Encouraged by the success of the Penguin venture, he extended his efforts to include other series, such as Pelicans (serious nonfiction) and topical Penguin Specials. The Penguin Shakespeare was published in 1937, and the Puffin Story Books, published from 1941, revolutionized children’s literature. Penguin’s best-selling reprint, D.H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover (1960), sold more than 3,500,000 copies after a much-publicized court case held that the novel was neither obscene nor corrupting.
Lane, who had been knighted in 1952, retired as managing director of Penguin in 1969 after publication of the 3,000th Penguin title—James Joyce’s Ulysses.
