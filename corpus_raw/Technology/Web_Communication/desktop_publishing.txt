Desktop publishing,   the use of a personal computer to perform publishing tasks that would otherwise require much more complicated equipment and human effort. Desktop publishing allows an individual to combine text, numerical data, photographs, charts, and other visual elements in a document that can be printed on a laser printer or more advanced typesetting machine. The primary advantages of desktop publishing over conventional publishing apparatus are low cost and ease of use.
A typical desktop publishing system comprises a personal computer, a video monitor, a high-resolution printer, and various input devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, or digital scanner. Some systems also integrate advanced memory storage units, communication devices, and other peripheral equipment. One of a number of different combinations of software applications is necessary to operate the system. Text and graphic elements are commonly created or manipulated with several separate software programs and then combined with, or copied into, a page-makeup program that allows the user to arrange them into a final composite. More powerful desktop publishing software programs offer full-featured word processing and graphics capabilities.
