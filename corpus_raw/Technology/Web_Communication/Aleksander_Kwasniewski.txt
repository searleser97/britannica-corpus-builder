Aleksander Kwaśniewski,  (born November 15, 1954, Białogard, Poland), Polish politician who served as president of Poland from 1995 to 2005.
Kwaśniewski attended the University of Gdańsk, where he studied economics and was chairman of the socialist student group. A leader in the student activist movement, he served as chair of the University Council of the Socialist Union of Polish Students (1976–77). In 1977 he joined the governing communist Polish United Workers’ Party (PUWP) and moved to Warsaw to edit two of the party’s youth newspapers—the weekly Itd (1981–84; “Etc.”) and the daily Sztandar Młodych (1984–85; “Standard of Youth”).
Kwaśniewski steadily rose through the party’s ranks, serving as minister of youth affairs (1985–87) and as chair of the Committee for Youth and Physical Culture (1987–90); he also served as head of the country’s Olympic committee (1988–91). The PUWP faced growing unrest, however, particularly from the Solidarity trade union, led by Lech Wałęsa. As a cabinet minister, Kwaśniewski participated in the round-table negotiations in the late 1980s that ended communist rule, cochairing the committee that dealt with trade unions. After the fall of communism, Wałęsa became Poland’s first postcommunist president (1990), and Kwaśniewski became a founding member (1991) of the Democratic Left Alliance, which in 1993 won a plurality of seats in the Sejm, the lower house of the legislature. Kwaśniewski then formed a ruling coalition with the Polish Peasant Party, which was similarly composed of former communists.
Campaigning for the presidency in 1995, Kwaśniewski capitalized on Wałęsa’s waning popularity, defeating him narrowly in a runoff. He was easily reelected to a second term in 2000. Kwaśniewski continued Wałęsa’s market reforms and oversaw the approval of a new constitution in 1997 (he had earlier chaired the parliamentary committee that drafted the document). Under his leadership, Poland was admitted to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1999 and to the European Union in 2004. He also supported the U.S.-led global war against terrorism following the September 11 attacks in 2001, and in 2003 he committed Polish troops to assist in the attack and subsequent reconstruction of Iraq, though he later claimed that Poland had been misled about the threat posed by Iraq’s weapons-of-mass-destruction program.
An agnostic, Kwaśniewski sought to develop better relations both with the Vatican and with Jews, approving an agreement that set forth Poland’s relationship with the Vatican, formally apologizing for a 1941 massacre of Jews at Jedwabne by Poles (the Nazis had been blamed for the incident), and restoring citizenship to many Jews deprived of it as a result of decisions taken by the communist government in 1968. He also vetoed legislation that would have provided compensation to individuals whose property was expropriated and subsequently nationalized by the former communist government. Constitutionally barred from running for a third term, Kwaśniewski left office in 2005.
