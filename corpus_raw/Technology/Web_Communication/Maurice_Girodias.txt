Maurice Girodias, original name Maurice Kahane,  (born April 12, 1919, Paris, France—died July 3, 1990, Paris), French publisher of banned books, including many classics of modern literature.
As a young man Girodias worked closely with his father, Jack Kahane, whose Obelisk Press published such classics of erotica as Henry Miller’s Tropic of Cancer (1934) and Frank Harris’s My Life and Loves, 3 vol. (1923–27). Girodias, who took his mother’s non-Jewish maiden name during World War II, was unable to regain control of Obelisk after the war, and in 1953 he founded Olympia Press. He quickly built a reputation for publishing books of merit that were censored or banned in other countries, including Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita (1955) and various works by Miller, Samuel Beckett, J.P. Donleavy, Lawrence Durrell, Jean Genet, Nikos Kazantzakis, William S. Burroughs, Georges Bataille, and the Marquis de Sade.
Girodias, a crusader against censorship, also published straightforward pornography, much of it written by established writers using pseudonyms. Dozens of Olympia’s titles were banned; thousands of copies were confiscated or destroyed; and Girodias was repeatedly arrested by French authorities and tried as a pornographer. In 1964 he fled to the United States, where he remained until 1974. He also published art books, edited an art magazine, and wrote two volumes of memoirs, including The Frog Prince (1980), which chronicles the first 21 years of his life in France after World War II.
