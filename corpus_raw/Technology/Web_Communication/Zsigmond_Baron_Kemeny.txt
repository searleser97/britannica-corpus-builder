Zsigmond, Baron Kemény, Hungarian in full Zsigmond, Báró Kemény,  (born June 12?, 1814, Alvinc, Hungary [now Vințu de Jos, Romania]—died December 22, 1875, Pusztakamarás [now Cămărașu, Romania]), Hungarian novelist noted especially for his minute psychological analysis.
Kemény’s private means and title smoothed the way toward his career. His achievements in politics came through journalism, first in his native Transylvania, then in Pest, where from 1847 to 1855 he served on the staff of the liberal daily newspaper Pesti Hirlap. In 1855 he became editor of the Pesti Napló, making it the most influential newspaper in Hungarian politics. As a partisan of the statesman Ferenc Deák, Kemény prepared the way for the compromise (1867) between Hungary and the Austrian Habsburgs by a journalistic campaign. Always eccentric, he became unbalanced and in 1868 had to abandon his editorship.
Kemény wrote a number of historical novels: Gyulai Pál (1847), Özvegy és leánya (1855; “The Widow and Her Daughter”), A rajongók (1858–59; “The Fanatics”), and Zord idő (1862; “Grim Times”). They make heavy reading: there is more description than action, the atmosphere is depressing, and the style is difficult. His heroes, entangled in personal and historical conflicts, move inexorably toward destruction. His novels of contemporary life, such as Férj és nő (1852; “Husband and Wife”), are pervaded by the same atmosphere of tragedy. Kemény’s masterful grasp of motivation and his fine evocation of the historical background were praised by critics and a select group of readers, but his novels were never popular.
