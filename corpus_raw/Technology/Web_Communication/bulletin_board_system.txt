Bulletin-board system (BBS),  computerized system used to exchange public messages or files. A BBS was typically reached by using a dial-up modem. Most were dedicated to a special interest, which was often an extremely narrow topic. Any user could “post” messages (so that they appear on the site for all to read). Bulletin boards produced “conversations” between interested participants, who could download or print out messages they desired to keep or pass on to others. At their height in the mid-1990s, BBS sites numbered in the tens of thousands, but the arrival of the World Wide Web led to a sharp decline in their numbers. See also newsgroup.
