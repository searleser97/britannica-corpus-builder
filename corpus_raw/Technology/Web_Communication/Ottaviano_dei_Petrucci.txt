Ottaviano dei Petrucci,  (born 1466, Fossombrone, near Ancona, Papal States—died  1539, Venice), Italian music printer whose collection of chansons, Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A (1501), was the first polyphonic music printed from movable type.
Petrucci went to Venice in 1490, holding music printing monopolies there from 1498 to 1511 and later at Fossombrone. In 1536, at the request of the Venetian Senate, he returned to Venice. His 61 music publications contain masses, motets, chansons, and frottole by the foremost composers of the 15th and early 16th centuries, among them Josquin des Prez, Jean d’Okeghem, and Loyset Compère. He also published the first book of printed lute music, Francesco Spinaccino’s Intabolatura de Lauto (1507).
