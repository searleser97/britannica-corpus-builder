Comcast, in full Comcast Corporation, formerly (1963–69) American Cable Systems,  major American provider of cable television, entertainment, and communications products and services. Its headquarters are in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Comcast was founded in 1963 by Ralph J. Roberts, Daniel Aaron, and Julian A. Brodsky as a small cable system in Tupelo, Mississippi. In 1969 the company moved to Philadelphia and was renamed Comcast Corporation. Its initial growth was fueled by strategic investments in rival cable systems, including Group W Cable in 1986 and Storer Communications in 1988. Additional rivals were acquired, including E.W. Scripps in 1995 and Jones Intercable, Inc., in 1999. In 2002 Comcast purchased AT&T Broadband, at the time the largest cable television operator in the United States, for $44.5 billion.
In addition to acquiring cable television systems, Comcast moved into the areas of entertainment and program content development. In 1996 Comcast created a regional sports cable channel called Comcast Sportsnet, which was later merged with Home Team Sports in 2001 and renamed Comcast Regional Sports Television. Comcast purchased controlling interests in E! Entertainment in 1997 and the Golf Channel in 2001. In April 2005, in partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment, Comcast acquired Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. Four years later it was announced that Comcast had agreed to acquire 51 percent of NBCUniversal from General Electric Co. (GE); the deal was completed in January 2011. Two years later Comcast purchased GE’s remaining shares.
Comcast’s digital cable television subscription offers customers hundreds of channels, on-demand options, high-definition programming, and a digital video recorder (DVR) service. High-speed Internet is available through Comcast’s residential broadband service. Comcast Digital Voice, launched in 2005, provides customers with telephone service plus the ability to listen to voice mail online and forward voice mails via e-mail.
