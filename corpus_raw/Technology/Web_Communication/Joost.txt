Joost,  Web site, launched in 2007, that provides advertiser-supported streaming videos over the Internet of television shows and films, using Adobe Systems Incorporated’s Flash video player. Access to Joost is generally limited to viewers in the United States because of international licensing restrictions,
Joost was launched by Niklas Zennström of Sweden and Janus Friis of Denmark, using a version of the peer-to-peer (P2P) technology that they had developed for two of their earlier business ventures—Kazaa, a file-sharing service, and Skype, a voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service. In late 2008 Joost abandoned P2P and switched to Flash, thereby sending users to its Web site, where the company could generate revenue by including advertisements around the video window or within the streaming content.
CBS Corporation and Viacom Inc. were the first major television networks and film studios to invest in Joost. In addition to rebroadcasting various over-the-air and cable television shows, Joost offers some feature films. In its first year Joost attracted far fewer viewers than Hulu, a Flash-based streaming service that also debuted in 2007. With the switch to Flash in 2008, Joost began to attract more viewers, though it continued to trail Hulu, which offered many shows from NBC, Fox, and ABC, as well as a wider selection of feature films.
In April 2009 Sony Pictures (a division of the Sony Corporation) declined to renew its broadcasting license with Joost, moving instead to offer its films via YouTube (a streaming video service owned by Google Inc.). That same month, Zennström and Friis began talks with two cable television providers, Comcast and Time Warner Cable, about selling the company, which was still struggling to attract more viewers. Joost attracts about a half million viewers per month, compared to more than 40 million viewers for Hulu.
