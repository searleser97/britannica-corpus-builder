William Taylor Adams, pseudonym Oliver Optic,  (born July 30, 1822, Medway, Mass., U.S.—died  March 27, 1897, Boston, Mass.), American teacher and author of juvenile literature, best known for his children’s magazine and the series of adventure books that he wrote under his pseudonym.
Although he never graduated from college, Adams was a teacher and principal in Boston elementary schools for more than 20 years. Under the pen name Oliver Optic, he wrote stories for boys, and in 1865 he resigned his position as a principal to pursue his writing full-time. Soon after that he began Oliver Optic’s Magazine for Boys and Girls (1867–1875), which enjoyed great popularity.
Adams was a prolific writer, producing about a thousand magazine and newspaper stories and well over a hundred full-length books. His books are written in series and take young heroes through exotic and educational adventures. His characters travel much and are well mannered, athletic, and patriotic, and the stories are laced with a strong moral. Adams’ books were popular with girls as well as boys, although girls appeared infrequently as characters in his writing.
Critics charge that, to the adult reader, Adams’ books reveal careless writing and are remarkable only for their vivid narratives.
