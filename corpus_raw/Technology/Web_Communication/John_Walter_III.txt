John Walter III,  (born Oct. 8, 1818, London—died  Nov. 3, 1894, near Wokingham, Berkshire, Eng.), English proprietor of The Times, London, from the death of his father, John Walter II, in 1847.
Walter made his most important contribution in 1866 with the Walter rotary press, which printed rapidly and simultaneously on both sides of paper wound on a roll; his press facilitated The Times’s struggle with The Daily Telegraph and other newly established penny papers. He was succeeded by his second son, Arthur Fraser Walter (1846–1910).
