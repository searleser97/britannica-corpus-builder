Sir Edward George Warris Hulton,  (born November 29, 1906, Harrogate, Yorkshire, England—died October 8, 1988, London), British publisher and creator (1938) of the Picture Post, a weekly magazine that exerted widespread influence over a generation of Britons during World War II with its dramatic use of candid photographs and vigorous text.
Hulton followed in the footsteps of his father, a onetime proprietor of the Evening Standard in London. After studying at Harrow and at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he was a prizewinning history scholar, Hulton twice (1927, 1931) ran unsuccessfully for Parliament as a Conservative. He became a barrister and then, in 1937, founded Hulton Press, which published such successful journals as Farmer’ s Weekly, Housewife, and Lilliput. During World War II Hulton provided funds for the Home Guard Training School and a group of politicians known as the 1941 Committee; he also organized support for the Beveridge Report on Full Employment (1942), which provided a blueprint for the welfare state. After the war, however, he rejoined the Conservative Party. The Picture Post covered the war, the slums of postwar Britain, early investigations of England’s “colour bar,” and the day-to-day life of Britons at home and on vacation, Hulton ceased publication of Picture Post in 1957 because of falling revenues, and in 1959 he sold Hulton Press. His book, When I Was a Child (1952), was an autobiographical account of life in a wealthy, unhappy North Country home. Hulton was knighted in 1957 and received the NATO Peace Medal in 1969.
