Collaborative software, also called groupware,  type of computer program that shares data between more than one computer for processing. In particular, several programs have been written to harness the vast number of computers connected to the Internet. Rather than run a screen saver program when idle, these computers can run software that lets them collaborate in the analysis of some difficult problem. Two examples are the [emailÂ protected] project, which distributes portions of radio telescope data for analysis that might help in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), and the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), which parcels out tasks to test for large prime numbers.
The Internet has become a business tool, and the ability to collect and store immense amounts of information in particular has given rise to data warehousing and data mining. The former is a term for unstructured collections of data and the latter a term for its analysis, which often involves collaborative software for both phases. Data mining uses statistics and other mathematical tools to find patterns of information. For more information concerning business on the Internet, see e-commerce.
