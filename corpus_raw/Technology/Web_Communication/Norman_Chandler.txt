Norman Chandler,  (born September 14, 1899, Los Angeles, California, U.S.—died October 20, 1973, Los Angeles), American newspaper publisher who helped change the Los Angeles Times from a conservative regional journal to one of the largest and most influential newspapers in the world.
After attending Stanford University, Norman Chandler joined the Los Angeles Times in 1922 as secretary to his father, Harry Chandler, the paper’s owner. Norman became president and general manager of the paper in 1941. In 1960 he stepped aside as publisher in favour of his son, Otis, under whose direction the newspaper gave more editorial space to liberal and opposing viewpoints. He modernized the Times Mirror Company’s operation and made the Times one of the most automated newspapers in the United States. After he relinquished the day-to-day operations of the Times in 1960, Norman concentrated on expansion and diversification, buying the daily Newsday in Garden City, New York, the Orange Coast Daily Pilot in Orange county, California, and the Dallas Times Herald in Texas.
In 1991 Otis Chandler stepped down as board chairman after 10 years in that position. The Los Angeles Times had won 16 Pulitzer Prizes during his tenure. In March 2000 the Chandlers, who owned the majority of Times Mirror stock, sold the company to the Tribune Company of Chicago. (See Chicago Tribune.)
