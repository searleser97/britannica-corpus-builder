Metal cut,  an engraving on metal, usually lead or type metal, or a print made from such plates. The earliest example of metal cut is the 15th-century technique called dotted manner, or manière criblée, from its characteristic use of dots to form the design. Perhaps the most original use of the metal cut was that of the English poet and artist William Blake (1757–1827).
