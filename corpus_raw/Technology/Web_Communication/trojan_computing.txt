Trojan, also called Trojan horse virus,  a type of malicious computer software (malware) disguised within legitimate or beneficial programs or files. Once installed on a user’s computer system, the trojan allows the malware developer remote access to the host computer, subjecting the host computer to a variety of destructive or undesired activities.
Named for the famed Trojan horse trick that enabled the ancient Greeks to capture the city of Troy, computer trojans can pose a serious threat to unsuspecting computer users. The user first unknowingly installs the trojan application, usually spread through instant-messaging software, e-mail attachments, or Web downloads. Through activation of this “backdoor” access, the computer becomes a “bot,” or zombie, allowing a remote malware user to perform any action that the computer owner could on the infected computer. Thousands of trojans in circulation are used for a variety of malicious purposes: browsing the hard drive to steal data, logging key strokes to acquire personal passwords or account numbers, erasing files, shutting down the computer at random, sending spam from the user’s e-mail account, or deleting the entire hard drive.
Trojans can affect millions of computers simultaneously, and they are sometimes used in targeted attacks against the networks of government organizations, universities, or businesses. They are frequently used for illegal activity such as corporate espionage, blackmail, fraud, and identity theft, but relatively few of those responsible have been identified and prosecuted. Trojans and other malware were developed alongside the personal computer, with the first trojans theorized in the early 1980s and developed in the 1990s. Malware development has kept pace with increasingly sophisticated malware detection and prevention software.
