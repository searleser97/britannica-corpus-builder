Robert Chambers,  (born July 10, 1802, Peebles, Peeblesshire [now in Scottish Borders], Scotland—died March 17, 1871, St. Andrews, Fife), Scottish author, publisher, and, with his brother William (1800–83), founder of the firm of W. & R. Chambers, Ltd., and of Chambers’s Encyclopaedia.
In 1818 Robert began business as a bookstall keeper in Edinburgh and befriended many literary figures, including Sir Walter Scott, who greatly admired his Traditions of Edinburgh (1825). Numerous other historical, literary, and geological works followed, many based on his personal research. Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844) caused great controversy, but was praised by Charles Darwin as having “done excellent service…in removing prejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for the reception of analogous views.” In 1832 Robert and William started Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal, and this led to the establishment of the publishing firm of W. & R. Chambers, Ltd. Chambers’s Encyclopaedia was edited by Andrew Findlater but supervised by the brothers.
After Robert’s death, William continued as head of the firm until his own death; he was succeeded by his brother’s son, Robert (1832–88).
