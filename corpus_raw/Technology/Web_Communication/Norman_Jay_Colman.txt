Norman Jay Colman,  (born May 16, 1827, near Richfield Springs, N.Y., U.S.—died  Nov. 3, 1911, St. Louis, Mo.), farm journalist who, as U.S. commissioner of agriculture, so enlarged the scope and activities of his bureau that it was elevated to the level of a cabinet post.
After a short law career, Colman in 1852 moved to St. Louis, where he became editor-publisher of The Valley Farmer (called Colman’s Rural World after 1864). Through its pages he advocated better farming methods and disseminated knowledge of new techniques, some of which he practiced on his own farm. He entered the Missouri legislature in 1865 and in 1874 was elected lieutenant governor.
Colman’s wide and practical knowledge of agriculture and his interest in improving farming techniques gained him the post of U.S. commissioner of agriculture in 1885. Perhaps his greatest achievement was the establishment of government agricultural experimental stations. He was instrumental in authoring the Hatch Act of 1887, which allowed government support of the experimental station program. President Grover Cleveland named him secretary of agriculture in 1889, when the Department of Agriculture became a cabinet office, but he served only briefly because of a change of presidential administrations in the same year. He continued to edit Colman’s Rural World until his death, after which it was absorbed by the Journal of Agriculture.
