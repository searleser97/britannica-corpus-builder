Lanford Wilson, in full Lanford Eugene Wilson,  (born April 13, 1937, Lebanon, Missouri, U.S.—died March 24, 2011, Wayne, New Jersey), American playwright, a pioneer of the Off-Off-Broadway and regional theatre movements. His plays are known for experimental staging, simultaneous dialogue, and deferred character exposition. He won a 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Talley’s Folly (1979).
Wilson attended schools in Missouri, San Diego, and Chicago before moving to New York City in 1962. From 1963 his plays were produced regularly at Off-Off-Broadway theatres such as Caffe Cino and La Mama Experimental Theatre Club. Home Free! and The Madness of Lady Bright (published together in 1968) are two one-act plays first performed in 1964; the former involves a pair of incestuous siblings, and the latter features an aging transvestite. Balm in Gilead (1965), Wilson’s first full-length play, is set in a crowded world of hustlers and junkies. The Rimers of Eldritch (1967) examines life in a small town.
In 1969, along with longtime associate Marshall W. Mason and others, he founded the Circle Theater (later Circle Repertory Company), a regional theatre in New York City. Wilson remained involved with Circle Repertory until 1996, when it closed. Wilson achieved commercial success with The Great Nebula in Orion (1971), The Hot l Baltimore (1973; adapted for television 1975), and The Mound Builders (1975). He also wrote a cycle of plays about the effects of war on a family from Missouri; these include The 5th of July (1978; televised 1982), Talley’s Folly, A Tale Told (1981), and Talley and Son (1985). His other plays include The Gingham Dog (1969); Lemon Sky (1970; televised 1987); Angels Fall (1982); Burn This (1987); Redwood Curtain (1993; televised 1995), about a young adopted woman’s search for information about the Vietnamese woman and American GI who are her real parents; Sympathetic Magic (1997); and Book of Days (1998). Some of Wilson’s plays are gathered in Four Short Plays (1994) and Collected Plays, 1965–1970 (1996).
