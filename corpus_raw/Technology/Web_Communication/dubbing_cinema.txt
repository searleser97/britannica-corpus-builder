Dubbing,  in filmmaking, the process of adding new dialogue or other sounds to the sound track of a motion picture that has already been shot. Dubbing is most familiar to audiences as a means of translating foreign-language films into the audience’s language. When a foreign language is dubbed, the translation of the original dialogue is carefully matched to the lip movements of the actors in the film. Dubbed sound tracks rarely equal the artistic quality of original foreign-language sound tracks, however, and hence subtitles may be preferred by viewers as a means of understanding the dialogue in foreign films.
Dubbing is often employed in the original-language version of a sound track for technical reasons. Filmmakers routinely use it to remedy defects that arise from synchronized filming (in which the actors’ voices are recorded simultaneously with the photography). Synchronously recorded dialogue may be unclear or inaudible in a long-distance shot or because of accidental air traffic overhead, or it may simply be impossible to conceal a microphone close enough to pick up the actors’ voices intelligibly. Dubbing allows the filmmaker to obtain high-quality dialogue regardless of the actual conditions that existed during shooting. Dubbing is also used to add sound effects to the original sound track. It may also be used in musicals to substitute a more pleasing voice for that of an actor who performs a song on camera.
The filmmakers of some countries rely on dubbing to supply the sound track of an entire film, because the technique can be less expensive and troublesome than synchronized filming.
