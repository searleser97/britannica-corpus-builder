FireWire, also called IEEE 1394  or  i.LINK,  high-speed computer data-transfer interface used to connect personal computers, audio and video devices, and other professional and consumer electronics. The American computer and electronics company Apple Inc. led the initiative for adoption of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ Standard 1394 (IEEE 1394). Apple trademarked FireWire for its own use, and the Japanese electronics company Sony Corporation, another early developer of the standard, trademarked i.LINK for its products.
The IEEE 1394 interface offers data-transfer rates of up to 3,200 megabits (millions of bits) per second, considerably faster than the speeds of other leading serial buses. FireWire, but not i.LINK, also transmits up to 45 watts of electrical power, enough to independently support many small attached devices. The standard offers peer-to-peer connectivity, meaning that a series of devices (up to 64) can be chained together without the central control of a “master” computer. Devices on a FireWire network can be connected and disconnected without cycling power. Because of its fast and reliable transfer rate, IEEE 1394 is frequently used in professional video editing and real-time video transmissions. It is also commonly used to connect electronic appliances in automobiles, such as DVD players, stereo sound systems, and GPS (global positioning system) navigators.
Scientists at Apple first conceived of the interface in 1986, and the company was the driving force behind the IEEE working group that developed the standard. The first version of the IEEE 1394 standard was completed in 1995, but adoption into the consumer market was slowed by the insistence on collecting licensing fees by Apple and Sony. These fees were eventually abandoned, and the interface became increasingly common in personal computers and consumer electronics, particularly high-definition televisions (HDTVs), DVD players, and cable receivers.
