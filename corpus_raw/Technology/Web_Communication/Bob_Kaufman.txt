Bob Kaufman, in full Robert Garnell Kaufman,  (born April 18, 1925, New Orleans, La., U.S.—died Jan. 12, 1986, San Francisco, Calif.), innovative African-American poet who became an important figure of the Beat movement.
With a Roman Catholic mother, a German-Jewish father, and a grandmother who believed in voodoo, Kaufman was exposed to a wide variety of religious influences; he eventually adopted Buddhism. At the age of 13 he left home to join the U.S. Merchant Marine; while sailing around the globe nine times, he survived four shipwrecks, severe frostbite, and hearing loss. He settled in San Francisco in 1958 and became involved in the city’s bohemian artistic community. His witty, surreal poetry was inspired by the rhythms of bebop jazz. Three broadside poems that were published by Kaufman in 1959 were later included in his collection Solitudes Crowded with Loneliness (1965). He also was a cofounder of the poetry magazine Beatitude.
In the early 1960s Kaufman was one of the most popular American poets among European readers; his second collection, Golden Sardine, was published in 1967. After seeing the televised coverage of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, Kaufman took a vow of silence, and he remained silent, neither speaking nor writing, until the end of the Vietnam War (1975). After that he wrote prolifically, producing poems with literary themes that are published with earlier works in The Ancient Rain: Poems, 1956–1978 (1981). In 1978 he resumed his silence, which he broke but rarely for the rest of his life.
