fourth-generation language (4GL),  computer programming language that is intended to be easier for users than machine languages (first-generation), assembly languages (second-generation), and the older high-level languages (third-generation). 4GLs are closer to human language than other high-level languages and are accessible to people without formal training as programmers. They allow multiple common operations to be performed with a single programmer-entered command. 4GLs are usually not general-purpose languages like third-generation languages such as C and C++ are but instead are usually designed for a specific purpose, as in the case of SQL, which works with databases.
