Pierre Attaingnant, Attaingnant also spelled Attaignant,  (born c. 1494, Douai?, France—died 1551/52, Paris), prominent French music printer and publisher in the Renaissance who was one of the earliest to use single-impression printing. (Earlier printers printed the staff and the notes in separate impressions.)
Before 1527 Attaingnant began using a newly invented movable music type, in which a fragment of a musical staff was combined with a note on each piece of type. He used the new type in a book of chansons, Chansons Nouvelles (1528). Because Attaingnant’s single-impression method halved the time and labour formerly needed to print music, it was quickly adopted throughout Europe. Attaingnant was the first to use the printing press to achieve mass production in music publishing. In 1537 he became music printer and bookseller to the French king Francis I. Attaingnant’s printings represent more than 150 outstanding composers of his day and include chansons, dance collections, masses, motets, psalms, and Passions. His 111 surviving publications are rich in information about early 16th-century music.
