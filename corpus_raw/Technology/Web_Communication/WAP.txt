WAP, in full Wireless Application Protocol,  an open, universal standard that emerged in the late 1990s for the delivery of the Internet and other value-added services to wireless networks and mobile communication devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs). WAP specifications encouraged the creation of wireless devices that were compatible with each other, regardless of the manufacturer or service provider. WAP was not a true protocol in the sense of the Internet Protocol (IP) or the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL); rather, it was a set of communication networking- and application-environment specifications that mirrored functions similar to those performed by more common ones associated with the Internet, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Because of slow and unreliable wireless connectivity and costly WAP services when phones emerged in the early 21st century that could handle the technical requirements of HTTP and TCP, WAP was supplanted as the standard for delivering the Internet to wireless devices.
