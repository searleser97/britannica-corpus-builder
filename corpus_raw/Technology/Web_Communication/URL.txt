URL, in full Uniform Resource Locator,  address of a resource on the Internet, or of a file stored locally. The resource can be any type of file stored on a server, such as a Web page, a text file, a graphics file, or an application program. The address contains three elements: the type of protocol used to access the file (e.g., HTTP for a Web page, ftp for an FTP site); the domain name or IP address of the server where the file resides; and, optionally, the pathname to the file (i.e., description of the fileâ€™s location). For example, the URL http://www.britannica.com/heritage instructs the browser to use the HTTP protocol, go to the www.britannica.com Web server, and access the file named heritage.
