Christian August Vulpius,  (born Jan. 23, 1762, Weimar, Saxe-Weimar [Germany]—died June 26, 1827, Weimar), German writer of popular historical novels and brother of Christiane Vulpius, Goethe’s wife.
Educated at Jena and Erlangen, Vulpius became secretary to the baron of Soden at Nürnburg (1788). He returned to Weimar (1790) and began his writing career by translating Italian and French tales of chivalry into German, later publishing some unremarkable accounts of medieval German literature. Vulpius was appointed to the library of Weimar in 1797. His most celebrated work is his three-volume Rinaldo Rinaldini, der Rauberhauptmann (1797–1800; “Rinaldo Rinaldini, the Robber Captain”), a work that served as a model for other historical novels and that was translated into many languages. He wrote about 60 popular romantic narratives.
Vulpius also undertook researches in numismatics, heraldry, and history: his 10-volume Kuriositöten der Physisch-littarisch, artistisch-historisch Vor und Mitwelt (1810–23; “Physical-Literary and Artistic-Historical Curiosities of Past and Present”) has some value as a collection of material. He had been appointed chief librarian at Weimar (1806) and published the periodical Die Zeit from 1817 to 1825.
