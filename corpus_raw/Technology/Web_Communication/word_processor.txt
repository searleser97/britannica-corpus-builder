Word processor,  computer program used to write and revise documents, compose the layout of the text, and preview on a computer monitor how the printed copy will appear. The last capability is known as “what you see is what you get” (WYSIWYG; pronounced wi-zē-wig).
Word processors facilitate writing and editing, especially with their ability to copy and move text (“cut-and-paste”), their built-in dictionaries to check spelling, and their grammar checkers. Other common features include a wide choice of typographic fonts and sizes, various paragraph and page layouts, tools for finding and replacing strings of characters, and word counts. Modern word processors also have many features once reserved for desktop publishing systems, such as table creation and importation of graphic images. They typically provide templates for common document types, such as letters, memos, and résumés, and can generate multiple copies of a document with recipient addresses drawn from a list (“mail merge”).
Before word processors were available, text-editing programs offered the basic editing capabilities of word processing but without WYSIWYG. WYSIWYG depends on high-resolution bit-mapped computer graphics displays. For example, IBM’s 1964-model Selectric typewriter with a magnetic tape drive predated bit-mapped graphics and had only modest formatting capabilities.
Programs known as text formatters give more control over document layout and appearance, especially for scientific and mathematical documents, than do word processors. On the other hand, these programs, like TeX and LaTeX, are much more difficult to learn, requiring an author to embed formatting commands directly in the text. (Word processors automatically generate and hide formatting information in the document file.) Desktop publishing programs have word processing features but also provide highly flexible layout and control over appearance to combine text and graphics for advertising copy, magazines, and books.
