James M. Cox, in full James Middleton Cox,  (born March 31, 1870, Jacksonburg, Ohio, U.S.—died July 15, 1957, Dayton, Ohio), American newspaper publisher and reformist governor of Ohio who ran unsuccessfully for U.S. president on the Democratic ticket in 1920.
After spending his early years as a country schoolteacher, Cox worked as a reporter on The Cincinnati Enquirer. In 1898 he bought the Dayton News and in 1903 the Springfield Daily News. Entering Democratic politics, he early became identified with the programs of party leader Woodrow Wilson, future U.S. president. Cox served in the U.S. House of Representatives (1909–13) and as governor of Ohio (1913–15, 1917–21), where he introduced workmen’s compensation, minimum wage, and the initiative and referendum legislation.
Cox was nominated for president by the Democrats in 1920, but he was defeated in a landslide in which the Republicans not only recaptured the presidency but won the largest number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives they had ever held. After 1920 Cox retired from public life and devoted himself to his business interests.
