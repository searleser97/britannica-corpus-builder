Special delivery,  service provided by the U.S. Postal Service for handling urgent mail. For the payment of an extra fee, such mail was delivered to its destination by a special messenger as soon as it arrived at the receiving post office rather than by means of the regular delivery system. This service was available for all classes of mail. Special delivery was introduced in the United States in 1885; private messenger companies were not allowed to offer comparable service until 1979. That year the Postal Service adopted new rules permitting private firms to deliver letters classified as extremely urgent. The postage fee for such mail was set at twice that of the prevailing first-class rate. Because the service was deemed inefficient and unpopular, especially because of the introduction of express mail and priority mail, special delivery was discontinued in 1997.
Other countries besides the United States have similar swift mail-delivery systems. The Canada Post Office, for example, offers a service known as “assured mail delivery,” which guarantees overnight delivery of certain mail to any part of the country. In Great Britain rapid conveyance of urgent letters is provided by the so-called night mail system, in which mail is sorted for immediate delivery in traveling post offices (TPOs) aboard trains that crisscross the country at night. A letter posted by 6:00 pm is delivered early the next morning to any but the remotest areas of the nation. In such major cities of continental Europe as Paris, Marseille, and Rome, urgent materials are delivered within two hours of mailing when sent by pneumatique, a pneumatic-tube conveyance system.
