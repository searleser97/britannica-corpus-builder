relational database,  database in which all data are represented in tabular form. The description of a particular entity is provided by the set of its attribute values, stored as one row or record of the table, called a tuple. Similar items from different records can appear in a table column. The relational approach supports queries that involve several tables by providing automatic links across tables. Payroll data, for example, can be stored in one table and personnel benefits data in another; complete information on an employee can be obtained by joining the tables on employee identification number. In more powerful relational data models, entries can be programs, text, unstructured data in the form of binary large objects (BLOBs), or any other format the user requires. The relational approach is currently the most popular model for database management systems.
