Luigi Albertini,  (born October 19, 1871, Ancona, Italy—died December 29, 1941, Rome), Italian journalist, an early and outspoken opponent of Fascism, who made the Corriere della Sera (in Milan) one of the most respected and widely read daily newspapers in Europe.
As a young man, Albertini lived in London, where he investigated labour conditions and studied the organization of The Times. When he became business manager (1898) and editor (1900) of the Corriere della Sera, he installed modern equipment and brought the paper’s technical services up to date. Through the Corriere della Sera he defended individual freedoms and governmental authority, regarding both as necessary.
Not a doctrinaire patriot, he favoured Italy’s entry into World War I but disapproved of the poet and violent Italian nationalist Gabriele D’Annunzio’s freebooting capture of Fiume (now Rijeka, Croatia) in September 1919 and the Italian annexations in Dalmatia. He supported the agreement of Rapallo (November 1920) between Yugoslavia and Giovanni Giolitti’s Italian government. Although Albertini had criticized the earlier postwar governments in Italy for their weakness, he was not reassured by the more forceful regime of Fascism and was one of the few newspaper editors to resist Fascist threats and cajolery. In November 1925, because of his stand against the government, the owners of the Corriere della Sera dismissed him.
Albertini devoted the rest of his life to historical studies and to land reclamation on his model estate at Torrimpietra, near Rome. He had been a senator since 1914. His major studies, including Le origini della guerra del 1914, 3 vol. (1942–43; The Origins of the War of 1914), were published posthumously.
