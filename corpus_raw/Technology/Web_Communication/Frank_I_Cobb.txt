Frank I. Cobb, in full Frank Irving Cobb,  (born August 6, 1869, Shawnee county, Kansas, U.S.—died December 21, 1923, New York, New York), American journalist who succeeded Joseph Pulitzer as editor of the New York World and who became famous for his “fighting” editorials. He was described as “liberal but sane, brilliant but sound.”
Cobb was a youthful high-school superintendent in 1890 when his interest turned to journalism. He quit the field of education to become a reporter for the Grand Rapids (Michigan) Herald at a salary of $6 a week. He moved to the Grand Rapids Eagle in 1893 and the Detroit Evening News the next year. By 1899 he was the leading editorial writer for the Detroit Free Press.
When he was in his late 50s, Joseph Pulitzer conducted a nationwide search for the best person to succeed him as editor in chief of the World. The search led to Cobb in Detroit. After enduring days of withering examination by Pulitzer, Cobb joined the World in 1904 as its chief editorial writer. Pulitzer, ailing with a nervous disorder, was a difficult boss, and Cobb was fired a number of times. Pulitzer once referred to Cobb as his “indegoddampendent” editor, and after one such firing, upon Pulitzer’s yacht, Cobb was left ashore at midnight. After each firing, however, Cobb would return, gradually installing himself in the World’s office. Cobb assumed the post of editor in chief on Pulitzer’s death in 1911, and he remained with the World until his own death, keeping the paper generally on the political course Pulitzer had charted. He took a leave of absence from the World in 1919 to serve as a member of the U.S. Press Department staff at the Paris Peace Conference. Cobb was a friend and adviser to President Woodrow Wilson and one of the scant handful of newsmen whom the president trusted.
