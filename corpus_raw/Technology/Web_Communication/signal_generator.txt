Signal generator,   electronic test instrument that delivers an accurately calibrated signal at frequencies from the audio to the microwave ranges. It is valuable in the development and testing of electronic hardware. The signal generator provides a signal that can be adjusted according to frequency, output voltage, impedence, waveform, and modulation.
Signal generators are of five major types: oscillators, which generate sine waves useful in measuring the response of loudspeakers, amplifiers, microphones, transducers, and acoustic systems; standard signal generators, which generate sine waves over a wide range of output power and modulation, used, for example, to test radio receivers and measure gain, bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratio; frequency synthesizers, which generate highly precise output frequencies over wide ranges; pulse generators, which produce pulsed signals at precise duration at precise frequencies; and random-noise generators, which produce a wideband noise for various types of electronic, mechanical, and psychological testing.
