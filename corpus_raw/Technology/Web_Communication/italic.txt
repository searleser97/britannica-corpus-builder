Italic,   in printing, a sloping, light-bodied, compact, and almost cursive letter form, which, with roman and black letter shapes, has been one of the three major typefaces in the history of Western printing. Used today almost exclusively as a special function adjunct of roman letters, italic types were used first as body texts in small volumes in which their space-saving, humanistic characteristics were desirable. Though originally designed in 1500 or earlier, the first notable use of italic was in an edition of Virgil (the “Aldine Virgil”), created in 1501 by Francesco Griffo, typecutter to the printer Aldus Manutius, in Venice. He designed his type on models of an informal, handwritten letter used in the papal chanceries of the time, and he cut his new face in lowercase letters only. He combined these with a suitable roman capital. Still later, a simple, sloping uppercase face was introduced as an intermediate between roman and a fully developed uppercase italic letter shape.
