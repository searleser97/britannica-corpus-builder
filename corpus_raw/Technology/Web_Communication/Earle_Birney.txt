Earle Birney, in full Alfred Earl Birney,  (born May 13, 1904, Calgary, Alta., Northwest Territories [Can.]—died  Sept. 3, 1995, Toronto, Ont.), Canadian writer and educator whose contributions to Canadian letters—especially to poetry—reveal a deep and abiding love of language.
Birney received a Ph.D. at the University of Toronto (1936). His first collection of poetry, David and Other Poems (1942), was published during his tenure at the University of Toronto (1936–42). He enlisted for active duty in the Canadian army and served from 1942 to 1945. He taught English at the University of British Columbia (1946–62) and held a number of teaching and editorial positions thereafter.
Birney’s other verse collections include Now Is Time (1945), The Strait of Anian (1948), and Near False Creek Mouth (1964). Most of his later poems are experimental. His verse drama, Trial of a City (1952; later revised as a stage play, The Damnation of Vancouver, 1977), is an indictment of modern Vancouver by heroes from Vancouver’s past. Birney also wrote two novels: Turvey (1949), a picaresque novel of World War II, and Down the Long Table (1955), which is semiautobiographical. Also an essayist and critic, he edited Twentieth-Century Canadian Poetry (1953). His Collected Poems appeared in 1975. Birney’s later works include the poetry collections Ghost in the Wheels (1977), The Mammoth Corridors (1980), Copernican Fix (1985), and Last Makings (1991), as well as several radio plays.
