Widget,  widely used type of Internet-based consumer software, particularly popular on social networking sites, that runs within a memberâ€™s profile page. Widgets include games, quizzes, photo-manipulation tools, and news tickers. In their simplest form, they provide such features as videos, music players, photo viewers, weather forecasts, puzzles, or news headlines in a tiny area of a Web page otherwise devoted to social networking, on a personal blog, or on the desktops of some personal computers. As the popularity of widgets has grown, several companies have begun to use them as an advertising medium.
