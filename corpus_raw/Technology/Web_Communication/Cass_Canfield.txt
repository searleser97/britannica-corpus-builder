Canfield’s education at Harvard (A.B., 1919) was interrupted by his service in the army during World War I. He held a variety of jobs in the United States before accepting a position in 1924 as manager of the London office of Harper & Brothers (founded 1817). Canfield returned to the United States in 1927 and became president of the company in 1931. From 1945 to 1955 he was chairman of the board and from 1955 to 1962 chairman of the executive committee and editorial board. He held the latter position from 1962 to 1967 in the newly formed Harper & Row firm, after Harper & Brothers merged with Row, Peterson & Company. From 1967 he was a senior editor. In addition to his work as a publisher and editor, Canfield wrote a memoir, Up and Down and Around: A Publisher Recollects the Time of His Life (1971).
