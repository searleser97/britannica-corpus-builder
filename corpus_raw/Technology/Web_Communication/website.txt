website, also called Web site,  collection of files and related resources accessible through the World Wide Web and organized under a particular domain name. Typical files found at a website are HTML documents with their associated graphic image files (GIF, JPEG, etc.), scripted programs (in Perl, PHP, Java, etc.), and similar resources. The site’s files are usually accessed through hypertext or hyperlinks embedded in other files. A website may consist of a single HTML file, or it may comprise hundreds or thousands of related files. A website’s usual starting point or opening page, called a home page, usually functions as a table of contents or index, with links to other sections of the site. Websites are hosted on one or more Web servers, which transfer files to client computers or other servers that request them using the HTTP protocol. Although the term site implies a single physical location, the files and resources of a website may actually be spread among several servers in different geographic locations. The particular file desired by a client is specified by a URL that is either typed into a browser or accessed by selecting a hyperlink.
