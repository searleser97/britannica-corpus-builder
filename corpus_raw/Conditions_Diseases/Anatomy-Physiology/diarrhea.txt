Diarrhea, also spelled diarrhoea,  abnormally swift passage of waste material through the large intestine, with consequent discharge of loose feces from the anus. Diarrhea may be accompanied by cramping. The disorder has a wide range of causes. It may, for example, result from bacterial or viral infection; from dysentery, either amoebic or bacillary; from impaired absorption of nutrients; from eating coarse or highly seasoned foods or drinking large quantities of alcoholic beverages; from poisons such as arsenic or mercury bichloride; or from drugs administered to reduce high blood pressure. Excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, parathyroid hormone deficiencies, irritable bowel syndrome, and uremia (an excess of nitrogenous wastes in the blood) all may cause diarrhea. Most cases of diarrhea are not serious and do not require treatment; dehydration can be prevented by drinking plenty of clear liquids. Diarrhea caused by an infection can often be treated with antibiotics.
