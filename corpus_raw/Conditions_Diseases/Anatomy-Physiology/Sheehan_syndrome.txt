Sheehan’s syndrome, also called postpartum pituitary necrosis,  insufficiency of pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism), caused by destruction of cells of the anterior pituitary gland by oxygen starvation, usually at the time of childbirth. The condition may also result from septic shock, burn shock, or a massive hemorrhage. Once the most common cause of hypopituitarism in women, Sheehan’s syndrome has become less common with improvements in obstetric practice.
In women giving birth, damage to the anterior pituitary may result from a drop in blood pressure caused by blood loss during and after delivery; the hypophyseal arteries, which supply the pituitary gland, constrict, temporarily cutting off the blood supply to the gland and killing some of its tissue. As long as at least 30 percent of the gland continues to function, no insufficiency of pituitary hormones will occur. Clinical manifestations of the syndrome include inability to produce milk, loss of axillary and pubic body hair, and failure to resume menstruation. Lifelong hormone replacement with estrogen, corticosteroids, or thyroid hormone stimulating drugs are necessary to correct the condition, restoring ovulation and stimulating the secretion of estrogenic hormones.
