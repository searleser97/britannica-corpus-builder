Phenylthiocarbamide tasting, also called PTC tasting,  a genetically controlled ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and a number of related substances, all of which have some antithyroid activity. PTC-tasting ability is a simple genetic trait governed by a pair of alleles, dominant T for tasting and recessive t for nontasting. Persons with genotypes TT and Tt are tasters, and persons with genotype tt are nontasters; there appears to be hormonal mediation of the tasting ability, however, because women are more often taste-sensitive in this regard than are men. It has been suggested that PTC tasting may be related to the genetically determined level of dithiotyrosine in the saliva.
PTC-tasting ability is not particularly useful, it would seem, since PTC does not occur in food, but some substances related to PTC do occur in food items. As for the utility of being able to taste PTC, it appears that nontasters of PTC may have a higher than average rate of goitre, a disease of the thyroid gland sometimes associated with a lack of iodine; because PTC and related compounds contain iodine, there may be a selective advantage of some kind for tasters or nontasters in different environments. It has also been suggested that tasters may have more food aversions than nontasters, a disadvantage in situations of food scarcity.
The chief reason for interest in tasting ability, however, is that the frequency of tasters varies from population to population.
