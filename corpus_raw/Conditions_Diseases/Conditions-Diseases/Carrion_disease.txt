Carrión disease, formerly called bartonellosis,  rickettsial infection limited to South America, caused by the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis of the order Rickettsiales. Carrión disease is characterized by two distinctive clinical stages: Oroya fever, an acute febrile anemia of rapid onset, bone and joint pains, a high mortality if untreated, and verruga peruana, a more-benign skin eruption characterized by reddish papules and nodules, which usually follows the Oroya fever (within weeks or months) but may also occur in individuals who have not exhibited previous symptoms. The skin lesions are thought to be an expression of developing immunity in the affected persons; reinfection is extremely rare.
Carrión disease is transmitted to humans by sand flies of the genus Lutzomyia, which propagate in the Andes Mountains in parts of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. Oyora fever develops between 3 and 12 weeks of disease transmission. The disease responds well to certain antibiotics. Control measures are directed principally at the insect carrier, with the use of insecticides and insect repellents.
The disease is named for Peruvian medical student Daniel Alcides Carrión, who in 1885 linked the two phases of the illness after inoculating himself with material from a verruga lesion of another patient. He subsequently developed Oroya fever and died.
