Chromoblastomycosis,   infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues that is characterized by the development of warty lesions, usually on the foot and leg. It occurs as a result of traumatic inoculation with any of several saprophytic fungi (genera Phialophora, Cladosporium, and Hormodendrum [or Fonsecaea]). The lesions develop over a period of years and usually remain localized; metastases (transfers from one site to another) are very rare. Treatment is by excision of the lesions, by iodide or X-ray therapy, or by local injection of the antibiotic amphotericin B.
