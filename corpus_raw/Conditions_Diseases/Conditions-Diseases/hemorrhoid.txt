hemorrhoid, also spelled Haemorrhoid, also called Pile,  mass formed by distension of the network of veins under the mucous membrane that lines the anal channel or under the skin lining the external portion of the anus. A form of varicose vein, a hemorrhoid may develop from anal infection or from increase in intra-abdominal pressure, such as occurs during pregnancy, while lifting a heavy object, or while straining at stool. It may be a complication of chronic liver disease or tumours. The weakness in the vessel wall that permits the defect to develop may be inherited.
Mild hemorrhoids may be treated by such methods as the use of suppositories, non-irritating laxatives, and baths. If clots have formed, or in the presence of other complications, the hemorrhoids may be removed surgically.
