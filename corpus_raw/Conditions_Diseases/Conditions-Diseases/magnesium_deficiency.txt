Magnesium deficiency, also called hypomagnesemia,  condition in which magnesium is insufficient or is not utilized properly. Magnesium is a mineral that is essential to a variety of cellular metabolic reactions and sometimes has the ability to replace a portion of body calcium. It is also required for the synthesis of parathyroid hormone. About three-fourths of the mineral found in the body is associated with calcium in the skeleton and tooth dentine formation, with the remainder contained in soft tissues and body fluids. Magnesium forms positive ions (charged particles) in solution and is essential to the electrical breakdown of nutrient and other material within the cells; it is also important to stimulation of muscles and nerves.
Magnesium deficiencies are noted in chronic kidney disease, malabsorption disorders, malnutrition, and conditions of acidosis (excess of acid), including diabetic coma. Symptoms of deficiency include weakness, dizziness, and convulsive seizures. Treatment requires a replacement of magnesium.
The best food sources of magnesium include cereals, legumes, nuts, meats, and milk and other dairy products.
