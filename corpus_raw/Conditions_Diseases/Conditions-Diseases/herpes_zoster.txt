Herpes zoster, also called shingles,  acute viral infection affecting the skin and nerves, characterized by groups of small blisters appearing along certain nerve segments. The lesions are most often seen on the back and may be preceded by a dull ache in the affected site. Herpes zoster is caused by the same virus as that of chicken pox; it probably constitutes the response of the partially immune person, resulting from the reactivation of a latent virus, whereas chicken pox is the response of the non-immune host. In most cases, spontaneous recovery occurs within two weeks. However, neuralgia may persist for months or even years after recovery from the infection. Herpes zoster is contagious if blisters have opened and the person with whom the virus comes into contact has not been previously affected by chicken pox (contagious spread causes chicken pox rather than herpes zoster).
