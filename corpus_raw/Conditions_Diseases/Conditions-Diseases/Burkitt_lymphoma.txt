Burkitt lymphoma,  a cancer of the lymphatic system that has an especially high incidence in equatorial Africa among children 3 to 16 years of age. The disease is characterized by tumours of the jaw bones and abdomen and is named after Denis Burkitt, who mapped its peculiar geographic distribution across Africa in the 1950s.
The Epstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis, is present in most persons afflicted with Burkitt lymphoma. However, this cancer is occasionally seen in areas of the world where it is not associated with the virus. Burkitt lymphoma occurs more readily in persons who have been weakened by malaria and in persons suffering from AIDS.
Burkitt lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and research suggests that it is caused by a genetic mutation in which a piece of chromosome 8 is translocated to chromosome 14. Localized tumours respond well to chemotherapy; long-term disease-free survival rates are about 90 percent for patients with less- advanced disease (stages I or II) and 80 to 90 percent for patients with more-advanced disease (stages III and IV). Involvement of the central nervous system, however, can lead to a far more serious prognosis.
