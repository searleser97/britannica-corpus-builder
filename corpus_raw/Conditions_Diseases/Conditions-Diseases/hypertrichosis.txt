Hypertrichosis,  excessive, abnormal hairiness that may be localized or cover the entire body. Hypertrichosis is associated with disorders such as anorexia, repeated skin trauma, systemic illness, metabolic disorders, and exposure to certain drugs and chemicals. In very rare instances the disorder is present at birth. Hypertrichosis differs from hirsutism, which is excess hair growth in women resulting from mild androgen excess.
