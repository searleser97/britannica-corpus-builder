Vesiculitis,   inflammation and infection of the seminal vesicles in the male reproductive tract. The seminal vesicles are ductlike glands that add fluid secretions to the seminal fluid as it passes from the body during intercourse. Infections present in the prostate or related organs usually involve the seminal vesicles also. Infections can reach the glands through the urethra or by way of the bloodstream.
The symptoms of vesiculitis are similar to those in cases of prostate infection; they may include a dull aching pain in the abdomen, discomfort in the urethra, pain after sexual intercourse, the presence of blood in the seminal fluid, premature or painful ejaculation, and impotence. Treatment is usually administration of antibiotics. See also prostatic disorder.
