Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS),  rare heritable disorder characterized primarily by great elasticity of the skin, skin fragility with a tendency to hemorrhage, poor scar formation, and hyperextensibility of the joints. The skin is velvety and bruises easily, and the ears tend to droop; dislocations of joints are frequent. Multiple subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) are known, and each subtype has certain unique clinical features as well as features that overlap with other subtypes. Hence, accurate diagnosis of EDS generally depends on genetic testing to identify the specific underlying genetic mutation.
There is no cure for EDS. Treatment centres largely on symptom management and typically includes strategies and medications to manage pain. Surgery may be necessary for patients with severe joint instability.
