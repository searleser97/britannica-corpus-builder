Mastoiditis,  inflammation of the mastoid process, a projection of the temporal bone just behind the ear. Mastoiditis, which primarily affects children, usually results from an infection of the middle ear (otitis media). Symptoms include pain and swelling behind the ear and over the side of the head and fever. An abscess may develop; this indicates that the infection has eroded the bone and destroyed its outer layer. Mastoiditis may affect other structures within the cranium and produce complications including meningitis, abscesses of the dura mater covering the brain; infection or blood clots of the lateral sinus (the large blood channel emptying into the internal jugular vein); and infection of the labyrinth (the inner ear) containing the balance and hearing apparatus. Mastoiditis is a rare condition that is treated by the early administration of antibiotics. Surgical drainage and removal of diseased bone may be necessary if antibiotics are not successful.
