Aflatoxin,  Complex of toxins formed by molds of the genus Aspergillus, which frequently contaminate improperly stored nuts (especially peanuts), grains, meals, and certain other foods. Discovered after an outbreak of “turkey X disease” in England in 1960, aflatoxins may cause liver disease and cancer and may trigger Reye syndrome.
