Ménière disease,  recurrent and generally progressive group of symptoms that include loss of hearing, ringing in the ears, dizziness, and a sense of fullness or pressure in the ears. Ménière disease can affect one or both ears. The disease causes episodic attacks that seldom last longer than 24 hours and are accompanied by vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. The apparent immediate cause of the disorder is an excessive amount of endolymph, the fluid in the labyrinth of the inner ear.
Diagnosis of Ménière disease is based on symptoms and the results of hearing tests, electrocochleography (a test to evaluate inner-ear pressure), and electronystagmography (a test to detect nystagmus, or involuntary jerking movements of the eyes elicited by certain head movements in persons with abnormal inner-ear function). Laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) scanning may be performed to rule out other conditions. Treatment for Ménière disease may involve medications, such as diuretics (to reduce fluid pressure in the inner ear), histamine agonists (e.g., betahistine), or certain other drugs (e.g., vestibulosuppressants and steroids). Symptoms can also be reduced with a Meniett device, which transmits pulses of pressure through the ear canal. Surgery to destroy or improve the malfunctioning part of the inner ear may be considered in severe cases, though the effectiveness of surgical management is controversial.
Ménière disease is named for French physician Prosper Ménière, who in 1861 provided a description of patients affected by hearing loss and episodic vertigo and offered the first evidence linking vertigo to inner-ear damage.
