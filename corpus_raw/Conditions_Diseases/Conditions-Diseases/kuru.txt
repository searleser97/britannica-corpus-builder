Kuru,  infectious fatal degenerative disorder of the central nervous system found primarily among the Fore people of Papua New Guinea.
Initial symptoms of kuru (a Fore word for “trembling,” or “shivering”) include joint pain and headaches, which typically are followed by loss of coordination, tremor, and dementia. After the onset of symptoms, the disease progresses steadily, and death occurs within two years. The transmission of kuru is attributed to Fore cannibalistic rituals of mourning in which the brain of the dead was eaten, especially by women and children. The disease has virtually disappeared with the discontinuance of this practice.
The American physician D. Carleton Gajdusek established the infectious nature of the disease. The infectious agent responsible for kuru is a prion, a deviant form of a harmless protein normally found in the brain. Unlike the normal protein, the prion protein is much more resistant to enzymatic breakdown. As a result, prions accumulate and multiply within nerve cells, damaging them and causing the characteristic neurodegeneration of the disease. Kuru is one of a group of prion diseases sometimes referred to as spongiform encephalopathies because the brains of those with the disease become filled with holes. Spongiform encephalopathies include diseases of humans, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and those that affect animals, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as mad cow disease.
