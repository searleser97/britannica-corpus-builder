Phlebitis,   inflammation of the wall of a vein. Phlebitis may result from the infection of tissues adjacent to the vein, or it may result from trauma or from a surgical operation or childbirth. A long period of bed rest and an attendant lack of blood circulation may also cause phlebitis. Varicose veins, obesity, and atherosclerosis are other predisposing factors. In many cases the cause of phlebitis is not known.
Phlebitis can last for years, and if it continues for a long time, the inner lining of the inflamed vein becomes irritated to the point that various elements in the blood are deposited there, forming a blood clot. This condition is known as thrombophlebitis (q.v.).
Phlebitis usually occurs in one of the superficial veins of the lower leg. The condition is more serious when it occurs in a more deeply situated blood vessel, since if a blood clot develops there and then breaks away and begins to circulate in the bloodstream, it can cause a serious circulatory obstruction. The indications of phlebitis include localized pain, swelling, redness, and heat over the inflamed vein. Examination may reveal a tender, cordlike mass under the skin at the site. If phlebitis affects a superficial vein, the condition is relatively innocuous and can be treated by analgesics and bed rest until the inflammation disappears, at which time mild exercise should be taken. In severe or serious cases of phlebitis, anticoagulants are administered to prevent the formation of blood clots.
