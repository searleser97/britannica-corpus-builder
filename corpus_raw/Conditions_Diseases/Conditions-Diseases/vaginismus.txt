Vaginismus,  involuntary muscle spasm that closes the opening to the vagina in the female reproductive tract. The spasm may be so intense that the vagina seems pathologically obstructed. Vaginismus is a sexual dysfunction resulting from physiological factors, such as sexual trauma, abuse, or anxiety experienced at the prospect of sexual intercourse. Vaginismus can totally prevent coitus or make it extremely painful, a condition known as dyspareunia. Treatment includes counseling and exercises to improve voluntary control of the vaginal muscles.
