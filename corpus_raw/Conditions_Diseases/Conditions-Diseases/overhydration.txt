Overhydration, also called water intoxication or water excess,  condition characterized by an excessive volume of water in the body. Overhydration occurs when the bodyâ€™s ability to dispose of fluid is overcome by a large fluid intake. It also can occur when the mechanisms for the disposal of excess fluid are defective, as is the case when more vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), a hormone that regulates the retention of water by the kidneys, is secreted than the body needs. Water intoxication from excessive fluid intake is rare but can occur in patients with psychosis, in athletes, and in people who consume large amounts of beer (beer potomania).
