Chondrosarcoma,  rare malignant tumour of bone formed from cartilage. Pain is the most common symptom. Primary chondrosarcomas arise from a small collection of cartilage cells; the secondary type develops slowly from a previously benign tumour of cartilage. The tumour may mestastasize to the lungs in some cases. An extremely rare form of chondrosarcoma also may occur as a primary tumour in soft tissues and muscle without involvement of the bone. Middle-aged and elderly persons are most often affected; the tumours are twice as common in males. Treatment includes surgical removal of the tumour.
