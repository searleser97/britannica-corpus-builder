Lymphangitis,  bacterial infection of the lymphatic vessels. The condition is caused by streptococcus or staphylococcus organisms that have entered the body through a skin wound. The inflamed lymph vessels are visible as red streaks under the skin that extend from the site of infection to the groin or armpit. Other symptoms may include fever, chills, headache, and loss of appetite. In acute infection, bacteria may spread from the lymph vessels to blood vessels, causing a potentially fatal condition known as septicemia. The spread of infection can be controlled or prevented with prompt treatment, which usually involves an injection of an antibiotic, such as penicillin or clindamycin. In addition, anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics (pain-relieving agents) may be given. The application of compresses to inflamed areas of skin also can be used to control pain and swelling. In some cases, abscesses may form; these are often drained surgically.
