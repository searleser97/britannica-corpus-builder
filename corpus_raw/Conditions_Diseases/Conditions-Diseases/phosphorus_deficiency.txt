Phosphorus deficiency,  condition in which phosphorus is insufficient or is not utilized properly. Phosphorus is a mineral that is vitally important to the normal metabolism of numerous compounds and (in solution) an acid that, with sulfur, must be neutralized by the base-forming ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. About 70 percent of retained phosphorus combines with calcium in bone and tooth structure, while nitrogen combines with most of the remaining 30 percent to metabolize fats and carbohydrates. Phosphorus is the principal element in the structure of the nucleus and cytoplasm of all tissue cells. It is also a universally distributed component of skeletal, nerve, and muscle tissues. A reduced concentration of phosphate in the blood serum is a disorder known as hypophosphatemia.
Phosphorus deficiency may cause bone diseases such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. An improper balance of phosphorus and calcium may cause osteoporosis.
Dietary sources of phosphorus include milk products, egg yolk, legumes, nuts, and whole grains.
