X-trisomy,   sex chromosome disorder of human females, in which three X chromosomes are present, rather than the normal pair. More common than Turnerâ€™s syndrome, where only one X chromosome is present, X-trisomy usually remains undetected because affected individuals appear normal, experience puberty, and are usually fertile. Statistical studies suggest a slightly increased frequency of mental disturbance, retardation, or both.
