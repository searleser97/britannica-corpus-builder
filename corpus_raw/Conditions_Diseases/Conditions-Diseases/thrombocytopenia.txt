thrombocytopenia,  abnormally low number of platelets (thrombocytes) in the circulation. Normal platelet counts are between 150,000 and 400,000 per cubic millimetre. When the platelet count drops to 50,000 to 75,000 per cubic millimetre, and particularly to 10,000 to 20,000 per cubic millimetre, spontaneous bleeding may occur.
Thrombocytopenia is associated with blood diseases such as aplastic anemia and leukemia and is attributed to impaired production of platelets. Similarly, excessive radiation, exposure to certain chemicals (such as benzene), or drugs used in cancer chemotherapy decrease the production of platelets. In sensitive persons, drugs such as quinidine (used in the treatment of malaria) provoke platelet antibodies and platelet destruction, resulting in thrombocytopenia. Other causes of thrombocytopenia include a congenital lack of megakaryocytes (cells in the bone marrow that give rise to platelets) and increased platelet destruction (e.g., from a malfunctioning spleen, congestive heart failure, blood transfusion after hemorrhage, or incompatible blood transfusion). Thrombocytopenia also may accompany certain infections such as measles and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Thrombocytopenia is characterized by the appearance of tiny purplish spots (petechiae) or larger black-and-blue areas (ecchymoses) in the skin, which are due to small hemorrhages into the skin. Other symptoms include nosebleeds and easy bruising; sometimes gastrointestinal bleeding, excess menstrual bleeding, or other hemorrhage is observed. Hemorrhage in the brain can have serious consequences. Treatment includes rest, protection from injury, and sometimes platelet transfusion.
