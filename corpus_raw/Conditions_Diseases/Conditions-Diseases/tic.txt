Tic,  (from the 17th-century French tic or ticq, “a twitching”), sudden rapid, recurring contraction in a muscle or group of muscles, occurring more often in the upper parts of the body. The tic, which may be motor or vocal, is always brief, uncontrollable, and limited to one part of the body. It does not interfere with the use of the part involved and may be halted voluntarily, but only for a time. If the tic movement becomes ingrained, the affected individual may become relatively unaware of its occurrence. Tics frequently involve the face and air passages. The most common tics are a repetitive grimace, blink, sniff, snort, click in the nose or throat, twitch, or shrug. Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent motor and vocal tics.
Children between 5 and 12 years of age are most likely to have tics; males are affected approximately three times as often as females. The tic appears when the individual is tense, and distraction may reduce it. Although the individual knows that he has a certain amount of control of the tic, he feels compelled to allow the movement or vocalization to relieve the urge.
The fact that there is no evidence of an underlying pathological disorder helps to differentiate a tic from other involuntary movements, such as spasms or cramps, or from the capricious, uninhibitable movements that may occur in chorea or epilepsy. While most tics are probably of psychological origin, similar repetitive movements may occur in physical disorders, as in the late stages of encephalitis.
Medications such as haloperidol, pimozide, fluphenazine, clonazepam, and clonidine are effective in reducing the frequency and intensity of tics. Psychotherapy, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback may also be helpful.
