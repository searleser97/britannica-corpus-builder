Perichondritis,  rare inflammation of the perichondrium, the membrane that covers the cartilage of the outer ear. Perichondritis may result from swimming in contaminated water or from injury. It may also follow a surgical procedure such as radical mastoidectomy, or it may occur as a complication of cauliflower ear. Symptoms include a foul-smelling greenish brown discharge from the outer ear canal, tenderness, redness, and a thickening of the outer ear. Treatment includes drainage of the accumulated pus and administration of antibiotics. Permanent deformity can result if the condition is not treated promptly.
