Cadmium poisoning,   toxic effects of cadmium or its compounds on body tissues and functions. Poisoning may result from the ingestion of an acid food or drink prepared in a cadmium-lined vessel (e.g., lemonade served from cadmium-plated cans). Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and prostration usually occur within 15 minutes after ingestion and subside within 24 hours. Inhalation of cadmium fumes in industry produces an acute, extremely severe inflammation of the lungs that may be fatal. Chronic poisoning from inhalation may cause a loss of the sense of smell, coughing, difficult breathing, weight loss, and injury of the liver and kidneys. Treatment usually includes the oral administration of calcium edetate.
