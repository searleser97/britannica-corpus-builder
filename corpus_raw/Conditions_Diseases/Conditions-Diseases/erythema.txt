Erythema,   any abnormal redness of the skin. Erythema is caused by dilation and irritation of the superficial capillaries; the augmented flow of blood through them imparts a reddish hue to the skin. Erythema may arise from a great variety of causes and disease conditions. Blushing is a transient form of erythema.
From a medical point of view, the two major erythemas are erythema multiforme and erythema nodosum. Erythema multiforme is characterized by the sudden eruption of crops of red or violet flat spots, wheals, papules (small solid elevations), and vesicles (blisters), the characteristic lesions often having a concentric, or target, pattern; the skin on the palm of the hand and the mucous surfaces, especially the mouth and eyelids, are commonly involved. Erythema multiforme is believed to be a symptom complex that is secondary to a wide variety of underlying disease states. It may run a severe course and become life-threatening; in mild cases, the eruption is prone to recur. Variable success in treatment is obtained with the use of corticosteroid hormones.
Erythema nodosum is a hypersensitivity reaction most commonly associated with streptococcal infection, drugs (particularly oral contraceptives), and sarcoidosis (a systemic disease characterized by the formation of granulation, or scarlike, tissue). It is marked by the sudden onset of multiple, red, painful nodules in the deeper layer of the skin on the external surface of the lower legs. It most often affects young women. The nodules usually disappear spontaneously over a period of several weeks. Recurrences are uncommon. Treatment is usually of the underlying cause and may include complete bedrest, oral salicylates, and—in treatment of sarcoidosis—systemic corticosteroids.
Those erythematous conditions that are directly caused by specific agents include endemic erythema, or pellagra, due to a dietary deficiency of the vitamin niacin; and erythema ab igne, due to nonburning exposure to radiant heat.
