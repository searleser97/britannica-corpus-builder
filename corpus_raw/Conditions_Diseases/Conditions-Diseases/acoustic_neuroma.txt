Acoustic neuroma, also called vestibular schwannoma,  benign tumour occurring anywhere along the vestibulocochlear nerve (also called acoustic nerve), which originates in the ear and serves the organs of equilibrium and hearing. The tumour arises from an overproduction of Schwann cells, the myelin-producing cells that surround the axon of the nerve. Early symptoms include mild unilateral hearing impairment, tinnitus (ringing in the ear), and sometimes dizziness. In some cases, the tumour, though benign, may grow and push against the brain or brainstem, causing headache, numbness in the face, or visual disturbances. An acoustic neuroma may be treated through surgical excision or radiation therapy.
