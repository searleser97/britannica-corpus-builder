Cryoglobulinemia,   presence in the blood of proteins called cryoglobulins that precipitate at temperatures below 98.6° F (37° C), both in the laboratory and in the body (where the precipitation could cause circulatory impairment or blockage or sometimes hemorrhage). Cryoglobulinemia is usually symptomatic of an underlying disease, such as multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia; it may disappear, sometimes permanently, after the primary disease abates. The condition in patients with no other disease (essential cryoglobulinemia) is treated by avoidance of cold temperatures.
