Overweight,  Body weight greater than the optimum. If moderate, it is not necessarily obesity, particularly in muscular or large-boned persons, but even small reductions in excess weight can improve health. An increasing proportion (more than one-third by some estimates) of the U.S. population is currently overweight, and health problems associated with it are increasing. The long-term effectiveness of diet programs and products in combating overweight is doubtful. Better approaches include educational and preventive efforts starting in childhood, and reduction of food intake (especially fat) combined with exercise.
