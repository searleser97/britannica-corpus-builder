toxoplasmosis,   infection of tissue cells of the central nervous system, spleen, liver, and other organs by a parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Infection occurs in domestic and wild animals, birds, and humans and is worldwide in distribution. It is estimated that 30 to 50 percent of the worldâ€™s human population carries demonstrable antibodies (indicating previous exposure), but overt symptoms are rare in adults. Swollen glands and fever are the most common findings in those who have any symptoms.
Organisms of the genus Toxoplasma reproduce by fission or internal budding. They move by a gliding motion, lacking either flagella or pseudopodia. Of uncertain taxonomic position, they are considered to be related to the sporozoa and possibly to the fungi. They are generally placed in the sporozoan class Toxoplasmea, although they may more properly be classed as coccidian parasites under the order Eucoccidia.
The mode of transmission of the organisms is unknown, although they can be passed from mother to fetus through the placenta. Congenital toxoplasmosis may result in stillbirth or abortion; infected infants may show various symptoms including jaundice, encephalitis, mental defects, and eye disease. Siblings of an infected infant are usually normal.
