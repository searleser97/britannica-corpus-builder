Marble bone disease, also called osteopetrosis or Albers-Sch√∂nberg disease,  rare disorder in which the bones become extremely dense, hard, and brittle. The disease progresses as long as bone growth continues; the marrow cavities become filled with compact bone. Because increased bone mass crowds the bone marrow, resulting in a reduced amount of marrow and therefore a reduced capacity to produce red blood cells, severe anemia results.
There are both congenital and acquired forms of marble bone disease. The congenital forms are associated with a decreased number of osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells) or decreased osteoclast function. Fractures are frequent; deafness and loss of vision may occur because cranial nerves become compressed by the narrowing of their passageways as bone is deposited in the skull. Severe cases may be fatal, but individuals with mild cases of the disorder may have a normal life expectancy.
Acquired marble bone disease is usually caused by fluoride deposition in bone tissue (fluorosis), which results in the growth of dense but brittle bone. The excess fluoride is usually ingested when drinking well water. Localized marble bone disease can occur in patients with cancer, usually in patients with breast cancer or prostate cancer, whose tumours have metastasized (spread) into bone tissue.
Affected patients are often treated successfully with bone marrow transplantation, which provides cells that can be converted to osteoclasts. Therapeutic agents that can be used to treat marble bone disease include gamma interferon, a protein that delays progression of the disease, or calcitriol, a vitamin D compound that stimulates osteoclasts to dissolve and absorb bone.
