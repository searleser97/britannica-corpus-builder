Epitope, also called antigenic determinant,  portion of a foreign protein, or antigen, that is capable of stimulating an immune response. An epitope is the part of the antigen that binds to a specific antigen receptor on the surface of a B cell. Binding between the receptor and epitope occurs only if their structures are complementary. If they are, epitope and receptor fit together like two pieces of a puzzle, an event that is necessary to activate B-cell production of antibodies. The antibodies produced by B cells are targeted specifically to the epitopes that bind to the cellsâ€™ antigen receptors. Thus, the epitope also is the region of the antigen that is recognized by specific antibodies, which bind to and remove the antigen from the body.
Many antigens have a variety of distinct epitopes on their surfaces. Each epitope is capable of reacting with a different B cell antigen receptor. In addition, the blood serum of an immunized person or animal normally contains a mixture of antibodies, all capable of combining with the same antigen but with different epitopes that appear on the surface of the antigen. Furthermore, antibodies that bind to the same epitope often have different abilities to bind to that epitope.
It is possible for two or more different antigens to have an epitope in common. In these cases, antibodies targeted to one antigen are able to react with all other antigens carrying the same epitope. Such antigens are known as cross-reacting antigens.
