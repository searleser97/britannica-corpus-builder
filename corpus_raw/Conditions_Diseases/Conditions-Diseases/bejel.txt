Bejel, also called endemic syphilis,  chronic infection characterized by eruptions initially in the mouth and on the skin and typically later involving the bones. Bejel is a nonvenereal form of syphilis. It is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum endemicum, which is closely related to T. pallidum pallidum, the cause of sporadic (venereal) syphilis. Bejel  occurs primarily in the hot dry regions of the Middle East and in the southern Sahara of western Africa; it is rare beyond those areas.
Unlike sporadic syphilis, bejel is not transmitted congenitally or through sexual intercourse. Rather, it spreads by contact with lesions, such as through kissing or the shared use of contaminated utensils. The disease is commonly spread from child to child in an unhygienic environment. The infection appears first as an eruption in the mouth and on the skin around the mouth. The initial eruptions may resolve, or the infection may progress, with lesions developing on the trunk, the arms, and the legs. The infection eventually fades into latency. Later the early stage may relapse, or latency may be terminated by the late stage of the disease, which is characterized by soft gummy ulcers of the skin, the bones, and the centre of the face, a patchy loss of skin pigment, and other conditions.
Bejel is diagnosed on the basis of microscopic examination of material collected from lesions as well as on the geographic history of the patient. Treatment of bejel, similar to that of sporadic syphilis, is with antibiotics.
