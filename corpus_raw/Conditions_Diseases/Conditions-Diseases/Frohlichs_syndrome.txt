Fröhlich’s syndrome, also called Adiposogenital Dystrophy,  rare childhood metabolic disorder characterized by obesity, growth retardation, and retarded development of the genital organs. It is usually associated with tumours of the hypothalamus, causing increased appetite and depressed secretion of gonadotropin. The disease is named for Alfred Fröhlich, the Austrian neurologist who first described its typical pattern.
The syndrome occurs most frequently in boys and, because of the close association between the pituitary and the hypothalamus, may be associated with reduced pituitary function. Impaired vision sometimes results from impingement of the tumour on the optic nerve. Fröhlich’s syndrome is treated by removing the tumour and restricting diet until normal weight is achieved.
Many overweight children may appear to have the disorder because of the concurrence of obesity and retarded sexual development; these children have no endocrine disturbances, however, and they mature normally after delayed puberty.
