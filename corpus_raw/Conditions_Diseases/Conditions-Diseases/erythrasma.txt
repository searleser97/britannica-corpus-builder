Erythrasma,   a superficial skin infection marked by reddish brown scaly patches and attributed to the bacterium Corynebacterium minutissimum. The lesions are generally seen on the inner sides of the thighs, in the scrotum, in the toe webs, and in the armpits. Erythrasma is more likely to occur in a warm climate. It is usually effectively treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but (on the foot) only extensive washings with antibacterial soap may be effective.
