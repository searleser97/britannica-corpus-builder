Buerger’s disease, also called Thromboangiitis Obliterans,  inflammation of the peripheral arteries primarily, which occurs chiefly in men from adolescence to middle age. The cause is unknown but may be hypersensitivity, especially to tobacco, because affected persons are often heavy smokers. As in peripheral arteriosclerosis, the disease causes intermittent lameness and pain during periods of rest. Buerger’s disease may eventually block arteries and cause gangrene. Some authorities classify the disease as atherosclerosis.
