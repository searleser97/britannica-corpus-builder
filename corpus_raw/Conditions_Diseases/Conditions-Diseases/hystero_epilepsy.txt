Hystero-epilepsy,  hysterical seizures that resemble epilepsy and, in diagnosis, must be distinguished from it. In hystero-epilepsy the reflexes and responses to stimulation in the part of the body affected are normal, and the electroencephalogram shows no significant abnormality in the brain waves. Usually the person affected can be roused by painful stimuli and is never completely unconscious. The convulsion usually takes place when others are present, and, in contrast to epileptic episodes, the person affected rarely injures himself or is incontinent. See also epilepsy.
