Blast injury,  any injury caused by a pressure wave such as that following an explosion. Blast injuries may be inflicted by such waves traveling in gases, liquids, or solids. The first is exemplified by the air blast caused by bomb explosions. Underwater blasts may originate from torpedoes, mines, and depth charges. Solid blast is the effect of a pressure wave that strikes the walls of a contained environment like that of a submarine or tank. Regardless of the medium through which the wave reaches the victim, it may cause internal fractures, organ perforations, damaged blood vessels, and massive bruises although the external skin may not be injured.
Persons in the immediate vicinity of an explosion are always subject to blast injuries. Minor effects include nervousness, shaking, and apprehensiveness; mild shock is common and, though itself of little moment, may be a manifestation of extensive internal injuries. Internal wounds may cause dizziness, unconsciousness, laboured breathing, and bleeding. Blast waves frequently cause rupture of the fragile eardrum membrane. Usually this is manifested by pain, difficulty in hearing, and traces of blood. If the lungs have been injured, there may occur a blue colouring to the skin (cyanosis), chest pain, rapid and shallow breathing, coughing, a frothy red mucus from the nose or mouth, or, possibly, respiratory arrest. Abdominal blast injuries are characterized by abdominal pain, tenderness to the touch, and slight swelling. If the abdominal injuries are severe, there may be vomiting and passage of blood in the urine or stools.
