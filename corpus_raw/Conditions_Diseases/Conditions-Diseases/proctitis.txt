Proctitis,  acute inflammatory infection of the anus and rectum. The most common cause of proctitis is the direct inoculation of pathogenic microorganisms into the rectum during anal intercourse, but it may be caused by sexually transmitted diseases, Crohn disease, or ulcerative colitis. The usual symptoms include anorectal pain, a purulent or bloody discharge, constipation, and inflammation of the rectal lining. Herpes infections also typically produce fever and rectal ulcers. Therapy is directed at the specific microbial cause, but diagnosis and treatment are often complicated by the presence of multiple sexually transmitted infections in the same individual. When the infection extends beyond the rectum to the sigmoid colon, it is termed proctocolitis; this disorder usually involves the additional symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and fever.
