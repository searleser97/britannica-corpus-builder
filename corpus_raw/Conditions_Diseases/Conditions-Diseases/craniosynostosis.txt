Craniosynostosis, also called craniostosis,  any of several types of cranial deformity—sometimes accompanied by other abnormalities—that result from the premature union of the skull vault bones. Craniosynostosis is twice as frequent in males than in females and is most often sporadic, although the defect may be familial.
Normally, the skull bones grow in response to pressure from the growing brain; growth occurs along the cranial sutures perpendicularly to the long axis of the suture. If the brain fails to grow or if all the sutures fuse early, an abnormally small head results. Of the various sutures, the sagittal (front to back along the top midline of the skull) most frequently fuses prematurely. Because the skull then cannot grow in width, the vault becomes long, high, and narrow (scaphocephaly). If the coronal suture (side to side near the front) fuses early, the skull becomes short front to back but wide and high (oxycephaly). Apert syndrome (acrocephalosyndactyly) is a rare inherited disorder in which premature closure of the coronal suture is associated with fused digits, defects of the brain and face, and sometimes other abnormalities. With premature closure of both sagittal and coronal sutures, growth occurs only vertically, and a tower-shaped skull develops. Crouzon syndrome is a rare inherited disorder characterized by the fusing of the coronal, sagittal, and sometimes lamboid (side to side posteriorly) sutures, undergrowth of the upper jaw, and other deformities. Premature closure of the metopic suture (which separates the frontal bone into halves for the first two years of life) produces a triangularly shaped head (trigonocephaly) and may be accompanied by brain damage.
Surgical procedures within the first two years of life minimize the deformities and decrease the possibility of such complications as mental retardation and blindness by allowing the sutures to remain in the open position until brain growth is complete.
