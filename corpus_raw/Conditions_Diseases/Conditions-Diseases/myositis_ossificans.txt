Myositis ossificans, also called Stiffman syndrome,  disorder of unknown cause in which connective tissue and muscle are replaced by bone. In the more common local type (myositis ossificans circumscripta), only one area is affected; ossification is usually observed to follow injury to the part. In the rare progressive type (myositis ossificans progressiva), group after group of muscles become ossified, until the individual is completely rigid. Breathing and swallowing become difficult, and fatal respiratory infections may occur. Steroid treatment of muscle injury and the use of medications to prevent calcification may slow the progression of the disorder; treatment for the local type may include surgical removal of the bone mass.
