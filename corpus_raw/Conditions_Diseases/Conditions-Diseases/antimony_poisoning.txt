Antimony poisoning,   harmful effects upon body tissues and functions of ingesting or inhaling certain compounds of antimony. Such poisoning resembles arsenic poisoning.
Antimony poisoning has resulted from drinking acidic fruit juices containing antimony oxide dissolved from the glaze of cheap enamelware containers. Toxicity can also result from repeated exposure to antimony in medications, such as tartar emetic (antimony and potassium tartrate), used to induce vomiting and in treatment of helminthic and fungal infestations. The industrial use of antimony has not appeared to be associated with serious occupational poisoning. It is believed that the toxicity of antimony and of arsenic is due to the fact that in combination with enzymes (the organic catalysts of the cell) they interfere with cellular metabolism.
