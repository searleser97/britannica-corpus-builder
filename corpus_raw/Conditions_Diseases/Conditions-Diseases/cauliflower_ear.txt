Cauliflower ear,   distortion of the cartilage of the outer ear as the result of an injury. If the injury causes bleeding between the cartilage and the skin, it produces a smooth and rounded purplish swelling. Accumulated clotted blood, if not removed, is transformed into scar tissue, causing permanent, odd-shaped thickening of the outer ear. Because boxers’ and wrestlers’ ears are subjected to so much pounding abuse, cauliflower ear is often associated with those sports.
