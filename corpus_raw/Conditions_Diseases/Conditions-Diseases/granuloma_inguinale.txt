Granuloma inguinale,  contagious sexually transmitted disease occurring predominantly in tropical areas and characterized by deep purulent ulcers on or near the genital organs. Encapsulated bacilli called Donovan bodies (Calymmatobacterium granulomatis) occur in smears from the lesions or in biopsy material and are thought to be the cause of the disease. Granuloma inguinale is treated with streptomycin or with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
