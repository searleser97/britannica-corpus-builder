Ventricular fibrillation,  a type of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) characterized by the irregular and uncoordinated contraction of the muscle fibres of the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. Since ventricular fibrillation completely prevents the heart from functioning as a pump, it quickly brings death unless emergency measures restore the circulation of oxygenated blood throughout the body. Ventricular fibrillation may result from myocardial infarction (heart attack involving the death of a section of heart muscle) or from electric shock, deprivation of oxygen, certain chemical imbalances in the blood (abnormally high levels of potassium or low levels of calcium), or the administration of certain drugs. Treatment centres on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), electrical defibrillation (the administration of electric shocks), and antiarrhythmic drugs. These measures are supplemented by closed chest massage, which serves to maintain systemic circulation and the integrity of the vascular beds. See also atrial fibrillation.
