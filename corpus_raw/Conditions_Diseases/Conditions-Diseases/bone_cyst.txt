Bone cyst,  benign bone tumour that is usually saclike and filled with fluid. Unicameral bone cysts affect the long bones, particularly the humerus and the femur, or heel bones in children and adolescents and are frequently detected as a result of a fracture. Treatment includes excision of the cyst and a bone graft, but spontaneous healing is common. Aneurysmal bone cysts usually occur in young males and consist of cystic bloody tissue that causes an expansion of bone. Swelling and pain are present; this type of bone cyst usually requires excision.
