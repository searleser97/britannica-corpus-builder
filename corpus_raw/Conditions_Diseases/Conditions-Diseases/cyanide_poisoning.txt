Cyanide poisoning,  harmful effects of inhaling hydrogen cyanide or of ingesting the salts of hydrogen cyanide, called cyanides. Hydrogen cyanide, also known as hydrocyanic acid, or Hcn, is a highly volatile liquid used to prepare acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic fibres, synthetic rubber, and plastics. Cyanides are used in many chemical processes, including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel, electroplating, and the concentration of ores. In nature, substances yielding cyanide are present in certain seeds, such as the pit of the wild cherry.
Hydrogen cyanide is highly toxic because it inhibits the oxidative processes of the cells. Acute poisoning from hydrogen cyanide or the cyanides is manifested by dizziness, nausea, staggering, and loss of consciousness. Death may occur rapidly after swallowing as little as 300 milligrams of the salts or inhaling as little as 100 milligrams of hydrogen cyanide. Exposure to concentrations of 200â€“500 parts of hydrogen cyanide per 1,000,000 parts of air for 30 minutes is also usually fatal. In sublethal doses, the cyanide is rapidly detoxified by the human body through combination with sulfur to form nontoxic sulfocyanides, and recovery is usually complete within a few hours, with no permanent aftereffects.
Because the poison acts with extreme rapidity, recovery from poisoning depends upon the promptness with which antidotes are administered. Fatalities may be prevented by such antidotes as amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, and 25 percent sodium thiosulfate solution.
