Exhibitionism,   derivation of sexual gratification through compulsive display of oneâ€™s genitals. Like voyeurism (q.v.), sexual display is almost universal as a prelude to sexual activity in animals, including humans; it is regarded as deviant behaviour when it takes place outside the context of intimate sexual relations. Exhibitionists are usually not dangerous, although the experience is frequently perceived by the victim as threatening; violence or sexual assault seldom follows the display.
The exhibitionist, almost always male, may obtain gratification from the reaction of disgust or fear on the part of his victim, but this reaction is not always necessary to his excitement. Previously normal individuals sometimes turn to exhibitionism following severe mental trauma or personal loss. The chronic exhibitionist, however, is likely to have a serious personality disorder.
Exhibitionism is the most common form of sexual deviation to come into conflict with the law in Western society. Nearly all of those arrested for exhibitionism are men; the disorder, if it exists at all in women, is seldom evident. Some experts suggest that female exhibitionism is not uncommon, but is not identified as deviant behaviour because there are socially acceptable ways for women to display their bodies.
