Elbow injuries,  the common sprains, dislocations, and fractures caused by forced movement of the joint beyond its range, as in falling on an outstretched arm or by a direct blow. Treatment of these generally involves immobilization of the elbow in a flexed position until damage has healed, followed by a graded exercise program to restore strength. In addition, some elbow disorders are associated with particular vocational or avocational activities: miner’s elbow, pain and swelling caused by frequently resting the weight of the body on the elbows, as in mining; or baseball pitcher’s elbow, in which a piece of cartilage or bone is torn loose inside the joint by the peculiar motion used in pitching a baseball, sometimes requiring surgical correction. For tennis elbow, see bursitis.
