Toxemia of pregnancy,  term formerly used to describe hypertensive conditions that can be induced by pregnancy. This term, once commonly used, reflected the belief that toxins caused the hypertensive conditions. Research, however, failed to identify any toxins, and the term is now regarded as a misnomer. See preeclampsia and eclampsia; pregnancy.
