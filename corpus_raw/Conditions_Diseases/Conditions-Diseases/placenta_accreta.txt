Placenta accreta,   abnormal adherence of the placenta to the wall of the uterus, so that it remains in the uterus after the baby has been delivered. Although uncommon, placenta accreta poses serious dangers to the mother. If complicated by coexisting placenta praevia (development of the placenta in an abnormally low position near the cervix), severe bleeding before labour is common. If placenta accreta arises on the site of a scar from a former cesarean section, the uterus may rupture during labour. Otherwise, depending on the firmness with which the placenta is anchored, it may be removed manually after the baby is delivered. If such removal is unsuccessful, an immediate total hysterectomy is usually indicated.
