Melorheostosis,  rare disorder of unknown cause in which cortical bone overgrowth occurs along the main axis of a bone in such a way as to resemble candle drippings. Pain is the major symptom, and stiffness and deformity may result. Usually only one limb and the nearest hip or shoulder are affected. The disease progresses in childhood but ceases with maturity; adults have no symptoms beyond residual disability caused by crippling. Surgery may result in some improvement of symptoms.
