Pericarditis,  inflammation of the pericardium, the membranous sac that encloses the heart. Acute pericarditis may be associated with a number of diseases and conditions, including myocardial infarction (heart attack), uremia (abnormally high levels of urea and other nitrogenous waste products in the blood), allergic disorders, and infections such as syphilis, rheumatic heart disease, tuberculosis, amebiasis (amebic dysentery), or histoplasmosis. However, most cases of pericarditis are idiopathic (of no obvious cause) and may be recurrent.
A person with pericarditis experiences pain over the heart, neck, and shoulder. The pain is sometimes increased during breathing and is relieved by leaning forward. Lying down may accentuate the pain, which may radiate to the left arm, the shoulder, and the neck. The affected person may experience difficulty in breathing and may be weak, anxious, and depressed. The skin may be pale or bluish, and the person may be feverish and delirious. Echocardiograms may reveal accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, and electrocardiograms (ECG) show characteristic changes. A rapid increase of pericardial fluid, called cardiac tamponade, may cause circulatory failure.
In severe cases, treatment involves slowly draining the pericardial fluid, and antibiotics may be given in cases that require treating an underlying infection. In idiopathic pericarditis, treatment involves reducing pain and inflammation with anti-inflammatory agents and prescribing rest. Acute pericarditis may result in the formation of scar tissue that contracts around the heart and interferes with its function. This condition, called chronic constrictive pericarditis, is corrected by surgical removal of the pericardium.
