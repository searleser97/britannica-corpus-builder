Candidiasis, also called moniliasis,  infectious disease produced by the yeastlike fungus Candida albicans and closely related species. A common inhabitant of the mouth, vagina, and intestinal tract, Candida ordinarily causes no ill effects, except among infants and in persons debilitated by illness such as diabetes. There is evidence that prolonged treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol and the tetracyclines, may predispose to the development of candidiasis, perhaps by killing off normal microbial antagonists to the fungus.
Candidiasis of the mucous membranes of the mouth is known as thrush and is a common fungus infection; it is usually localized and mild but may spread into a generalized cutaneous eruption. Thrush most often occurs in bottle-fed babies and in persons with terminal illness. Candidiasis of the mucous membranes of the vagina is called vaginitis; it is most common in diabetic or pregnant women.
Candidiasis of the skin is most likely to occur in the folds, especially in moist areas such as the armpits, between the buttocks, and in the navel. The folds between the fingers and around the nails are often affected in persons whose hands are frequently wet. Perl√®che is a Candida infection occurring at the corners of the mouth.
Occasionally the fungus invades the respiratory system, producing a bronchopulmonary infection that simulates miliary tuberculosis. The infection rarely becomes systemic, but when it does so it may damage the lining of the heart or the meninges.
Some forms of candidiasis are easily treatable; others are more refractory. Iodide and gentian violet have endured as therapeutic agents, while nystatin, an antifungal antibiotic, has shown some efficacy.
