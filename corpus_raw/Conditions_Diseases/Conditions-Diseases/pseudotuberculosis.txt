Pseudotuberculosis,   any of various diseases not caused by the tubercle bacillus but marked by the formation of tubercle-like nodules. Pseudotuberculous disorders of humans, now seldom called pseudotuberculosis, include actinomycosis, glanders, and nocardiosis (q.v.); pseudotuberculous thyroiditis is now designated granulomatous thyroiditis (see thyroiditis). In veterinary medicine, “pseudotuberculosis” denotes caseous lymphadenitis, a disease of sheep and goats caused by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection, occurring in many mammals and birds.
