Monster,  in biology, an embryo, a newborn animal, or young plant that is grossly deformed. The defects may be genetic (i.e., inherited) or result from such influences as drugs, X rays, or diseases. Two main types of monster are recognized: those with defective or excessive growth of body parts and those with partial or complete doubling of the body on one of its axes. The repetition or absence of body parts such as fingers or toes are frequent anomalies in humans and other mammals. 
The investigation of gross abnormalities, the subject matter of teratology, can often illuminate the normal course of development of organisms.
