Pick disease,  form of premature dementia caused by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It resembles Alzheimer disease but is much less common. Pick disease is characterized by a progressive deterioration of intellect, judgment, and memory, resulting in increased irritability, inappropriate behaviour, depression, and paranoia. Histologically some cerebral nerve cells are swollen and contain abnormal inclusions called Pick bodies. The cause of Pick disease is unknown, but in some cases the disease appears to be inherited. Average survival from onset (generally between the ages of 40 and 60) to death is about 10 years; there is no specific treatment. The disease was first described by the German neurologist Arnold Pick.
