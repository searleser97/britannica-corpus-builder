Neurofibromatosis,   either of two hereditary disorders characterized by distinctive skin lesions and by benign, progressively enlarging tumours of the nervous system. Neurofibromatosis type 1, also known as von Recklinghausen’s disease, is much the more common of the two disorders and is present in about one of every 3,000 live births. This type is characterized by the presence of café-au-lait (pale brown) spots on the skin and the formation of numerous benign soft tumours arising from the abnormal growth of nerves. The café-au-lait spots may be present at birth or infancy, and the neurofibromas and other tumours appear in late childhood or early adulthood; the latter can sometimes result in grossly disfiguring effects owing to their large size. The course of the disease is progressive in most cases. Neurofibromatosis type 2 is a much rarer inherited disease marked by tumours of the auditory canal in the ear and by small numbers of café-au-lait spots.
Neurofibromatosis 1 is passed on as an autosomal dominant trait, and the child of someone with the disease has a 50-percent chance of developing it. About half of all cases of the disorder, however, result from genetic mutation at conception rather than from familial inheritance. In 1990 scientists identified a gene on human chromosome 17 that is responsible for neurofibromatosis type 1; a defective version of this gene allows nerve cells to grow without restraint, resulting in neurofibromas.
