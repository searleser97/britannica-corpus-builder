False memory syndrome, also called recovered memory, pseudomemory, and memory distortion,  the experience, usually in the context of adult psychotherapy, of seeming to remember events that never actually occurred. These pseudomemories are often quite vivid and emotionally charged, especially those representing acts of abuse or violence committed against the subject during childhood.
It is not entirely clear how pseudomemories come about, but certain therapeutic practices are considered likely to reinforce and encourage their creation. For example, some therapists use hypnosis or techniques of “guided imagery” on clients who appear to be suffering from the suppression of memories of emotionally disturbing events, often experienced during childhood. Encouraged to visualize episodes of violence or abuse during therapy, clients may subsequently have difficulty separating these imaginary events from reality. Researchers have found that people who “recover” pseudomemories of trauma are often more suggestible and more prone to dissociate—that is, to feel separated from their actual experiences—than most other people.
Questions about the authenticity of memories recovered in therapy have led to debate between various academic, legal, and medical professionals. Because the client’s purported memories often concern events that allegedly occurred many years in the past and in private, they are often difficult or impossible to corroborate.
In response to controversies that emerged in the mid-1990s surrounding recovered memory and reports of abuse, in 1995 the American Psychological Association (APA) recommended that those seeking psychotherapy be cautious of therapists who instantly accept or dismiss explanations of childhood abuse. The organization further stated that childhood abuse is not correlated with any specific set of symptoms in adulthood. (See also psychogenic amnesia in memory abnormality; memory.)
