Sulfhemoglobinemia,  presence in the blood of sulfhemoglobin, the product of abnormal, irreversible binding of sulfur by the hemoglobin in the red blood cells, rendering them incapable of transporting oxygen. The condition may result from the chronic use of such drugs as acetanilide and phenacetin. Symptoms include cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes) and constipation. Concentrations of sulfhemoglobin sufficient to endanger life do not seem to occur clinically. The abnormal hemoglobin is removed from circulation only when the red cells are destroyed at the end of their life-span; treatment consists of detecting the causative drug and avoiding it.
