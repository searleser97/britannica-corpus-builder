Septicemia, formerly called blood poisoning,  infection resulting from the presence of bacteria in the blood (bacteremia). The onset of septicemia is signaled by a high fever, chills, weakness, and excessive sweating, followed by a decrease in blood pressure. The typical microorganisms that produce septicemia, usually gram-negative bacteria, release toxic products that trigger immune responses and widespread blood clotting (coagulation) within the blood vessels, thus reducing the flow of blood to tissues and organs. (For information on the systemic inflammatory condition that occurs as a complication of infection by any class of microorganism, see sepsis.)
The development of septicemia following surgery or after the patient has contracted an infectious disease indicates that the infectious process has escaped the control of the bodyâ€™s immune system and requires immediate medical intervention. Septicemia has increased in both severity and incidence, especially in hospitalized patients, because of both the more invasive technology employed and the increased prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the hospital environment.
Septicemia often cannot be traced to a single microorganism but results from multiple infections, so that broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy may be required. If not treated promptly with appropriate antibiotics and surgical drainage of any detectable foci of infection, septicemia is followed by septic shock, in which the mortality rate exceeds 50 percent.
