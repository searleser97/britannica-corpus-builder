Shenute, also spelled Shenoute, Shenoud, Shenoudi, or Schenoudi,  (born c. 360—died c. 450), monastic reformer, abbot of the White Monastery, near Atripe in Upper Egypt, who is regarded as a saint in the Coptic (Egyptian Christian) Church.
Shenute entered monastic life as a youth and succeeded his uncle as abbot of the White Monastery in 383. He revived the rule of Pachomius, the 4th-century founder of cenobitic, or communal, monasticism (as opposed to the solitary, contemplative religious life), which emphasized manual labour, liturgical prayer, and strict obedience. Shenute was the first abbot to require of his monks a written profession of obedience.
In 431 Shenute attended the Council of Ephesus, where he joined in the condemnation of Nestorius and his teachings on the nature of Christ. Shenute wrote extensively, primarily letters and sermons, attacking paganism and heresy and expressing his views on monastic life. These works are among the earliest-known writings in the Coptic language and, from a literary viewpoint, are considered unsurpassed in their mastery of that language. Although many of Shenute’s original works were preserved in the monastic library, none were translated into Greek or Latin. Thus, his writings were virtually unknown to Western church historians until modern times. According to legend, Shenute ruled the monastery for 83 years and lived to the age of 118.
