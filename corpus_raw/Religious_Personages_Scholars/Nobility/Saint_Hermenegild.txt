St. Hermenegild, Hermenegild also spelled Ermengild,  (died April 13, 585, Tarragona, kingdom of the Visigoths [Spain]; canonized 1585; feast day April 13), Visigothic prince who is celebrated as a saint and martyr.
Hermenegild was the son of Leovigild of Spain and was brought up in the Arian heresy. In 579 he married Ingund, the daughter of Sigebert I of Austrasia and  a zealous orthodox Catholic. He was given a separate command at his fatherâ€™s siege of Byzantine-held Sevilla (Seville), where he was converted through the efforts of his wife and the bishop of Sevilla, St. Leander. Hermenegild immediately rebelled against his heretic father and was initially aided by the Byzantines, though Leovigild succeeded in buying them off. Hermenegild was then captured and eventually beheaded. Most contemporary writers suggested that Hermenegild was executed as a rebel, but Pope Gregory I, in his Dialogues, stated that he was killed for refusing to receive Communion from an Arian bishop. His cult was subsequently authorized for Spain by Pope Sixtus V and for the whole church by Urban VIII.
