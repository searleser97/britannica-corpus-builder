Saint Fulbert of Chartres,  (born c. 960, Picardy region, France—died  April 10, 1028, Chartres; feast day April 10), French bishop of Chartres who developed the cathedral school there into one of Europe’s chief centres of learning.
Educated at Reims under Gerbert (later Pope Sylvester II), Fulbert was appointed chancellor of the cathedral of Chartres in 990, when he began his work on behalf of the school. His teaching gained him a reputation for erudition and determination in pursuit of the truth. As bishop of Chartres from 1006, Fulbert was sent on diplomatic missions to Rome by King Robert II, whom he supported in his conflict with the nobles of France and with William V of Aquitaine. In 1020 Fulbert began to rebuild the burned cathedral of Chartres, but he died before the work was completed.
