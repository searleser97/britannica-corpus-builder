Saint Catherine of Genoa, original name Caterina Fieschi,  (born 1447, Genoa [Italy]—died Sept. 15, 1510; canonized 1737; feast day September 15), Italian mystic admired for her work among the sick and the poor.
Catherine was born into a distinguished family and received a careful education. Her early aspirations to become a nun were frustrated by an arranged marriage to Giuliano Adorno. After several years of unhappiness she led a life of pleasure for a time but was converted by a mystical experience in 1473, which marked the beginning of her life of close union with God. This she combined with assiduous service to the sick in a hospital at Genoa, in which her husband joined her after he, too, had been converted.
St. Catherine’s two works, the Trattato del Purgatorio and the Dialogo, are the outcome of her mystical life. Her authorship of these has been denied, but according to her biographer Umile Bonzi a large part of both works is her own, though they received their final form only after her death. They were first printed, together with her biography, in 1551: Libro de la vita mirabile et dottrina santa de la Beata Caterinetta de Genoa (Life and Doctrine of Saint Catherine of Genoa). Her life and doctrine were the subject of Baron Friedrich von Hügel’s classic work The Mystical Element of Religion (1908).
