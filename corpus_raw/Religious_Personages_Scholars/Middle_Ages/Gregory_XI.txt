Gregory XI, original name Pierre-roger De Beaufort,  (born 1329, Limoges-Fourche, France—died  March 26/27, 1378, Rome, Papal States [Italy]), the last French pope and the last of the Avignonese popes, when Avignon was the papal seat (1309–77). He reigned from 1370 to 1378.
Beaufort was made cardinal in 1348 by his uncle, Pope Clement VI. Although not a priest, he was unanimously elected pope at Avignon on Dec. 30, 1370, to succeed Urban V. As pope, he immediately considered returning the papacy to Rome to conduct negotiations for reuniting the Eastern and Western churches and to maintain papal territories against a Florentine revolt being led by the powerful Visconti family.
Gregory temporarily shelved his Roman plan, however, to labour (unsuccessfully) for peace between England and France, because another phase in the Hundred Years’ War had begun in 1369. In 1375 Gregory defeated Florence in its war against the Papal States. The following year the great mystic (later patron saint of Italy) St. Catherine of Siena encouraged Gregory to move to Rome. In December 1376 peace was concluded with Florence. On Jan. 17, 1377, Gregory returned the papacy to Rome over the opposition of France and of several cardinals. Although his months there were marked by strife and led him to flee temporarily to Anagni, his move back to Rome was a highly significant act in papal history, for the papacy, despite the reign of antipopes later in other cities, thenceforth remained at Rome.
