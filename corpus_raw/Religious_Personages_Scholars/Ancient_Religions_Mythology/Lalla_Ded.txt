Lalla Ded, also known as Lal Ded or Lalles hvari,  (flourished 14th century ce), Hindu poet-saint from Kashmir, who defied social convention in her search for God.
Legend tells of the harsh treatment Lalla Ded received from her husband and mother-in-law and extols her patience and forbearance. Twelve years after being wed, she left her home in order to dedicate herself to Shiva and became a wandering religious singer. Her poems and songs concern the longing for God and the joy she finds in the deity who lives within, as well as her disregard for conventional forms of worship such as image worship: “Temple and image, the two that you have fashioned, are no better than stone.” Her highly emotional lyrics became famous among the devotees of Shiva and are revered as being among the finest products of the poet-saints of the Hindu bhakti tradition.
