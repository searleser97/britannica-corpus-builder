Saint Stephen of Perm, Russian Stefan Permsky,  (born c. 1340, Veliky Ustyug, principality of Vladimir-Suzdal [now in Russia]—died 1396; feast day April 26), one of the most successful and dynamic missionaries of the Russian Orthodox Church.
During the 13th and 14th centuries, the Russian Orthodox Church expanded northward and eastward and succeeded in establishing monasteries at Sarai and at Lake Ladoga to begin the work of converting the Tatars and the Finns. Stephen of Perm’s triumphant missions were in this tradition of Russian Orthodox evangelism. Having been a monk for 13 years at Rostov, Stephen traveled in 1379 to the territory of the Komi (then known as Zyryans), located in the frigid lands southeast of the White Sea between the Pechora and Vychegda rivers.
Stephen, who had been born among the Komi but was himself a Russian, translated the Bible and liturgy from Greek into the Komi (Zyryan) language. He undertook these translations for two reasons: he was anxious to avoid forcing Russian ways on the Komi people, and he believed that each people should worship in its own tongue. He was so committed to these two principles that instead of using Russian Cyrillic characters as the script for their language, he invented an alphabet based on the details and patterns of Komi embroidery and carving. Stephen also founded schools to teach the language, as well as seminaries for the training of priests. In 1383 he was named the first bishop of Perm.
