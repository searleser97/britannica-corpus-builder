Benedict V, byname Benedict The Grammarian,  Latin Benedictus Grammaticus,  (died July 4, 966, Hamburg), pope, or antipope, from May 22, 964, to June 23, 964, when he was deposed. His election by the Romans on the death of Pope John XII infuriated the Holy Roman emperor Otto I, who had already deposed John and designated Leo VIII as successor. Otto forced his way into Rome and convened a synod that deposed and degraded Benedict, reducing him to deacon. After reinstating Leo, Otto brought Benedict to Hamburg, where he earned a reputation for personal holiness. Either Benedict or Leo may be considered an antipope.
