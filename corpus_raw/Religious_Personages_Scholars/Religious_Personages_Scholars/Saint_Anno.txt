Saint Anno,  Anno also spelled Hanno,  (born c. 1010, Swabia—died  Dec. 4, 1075; canonized 1183; feast day December 4), archbishop of Cologne who was prominent in the political struggles of the Holy Roman Empire.
Educated at Bamberg, Anno became confessor to the Holy Roman emperor Henry III, who appointed him archbishop in 1056. He was the leader of the party that abducted the young king Henry IV from his mother, Agnes of Poitou. Anno then seized the regency but was compelled to share it with Adalbert, the powerful archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. In 1064 he left the court but recovered some of his former influence over Henry when Adalbert fell from favour in 1066. Anno’s most important service was at the Council of Mantua (May 1064), when he succeeded in having Alexander II recognized as pope against the antipope Honorius II, who was originally a nominee of the German court. Anno retired to a life of strict penance at the Abbey of Siegburg, which he had founded in 1064.
