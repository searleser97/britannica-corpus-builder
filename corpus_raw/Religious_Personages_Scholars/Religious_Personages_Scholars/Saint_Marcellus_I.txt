St. Marcellus I,  (born, Romeâ€”died  309; feast day January 16), pope from December 306 to January 308 or from May or June 308 to January 16, 309. He succeeded St. Marcellinus after an interval of three or four years, following a period of great disruption in the church due to the persecutions of Christians by the Roman emperor Diocletian. The penances that Marcellus imposed on certain apostates returning to the faith after the persecutions led to rioting, and in 309 he was banished from Rome by the emperor Maxentius for disturbing the peace. He died shortly afterward, and his body was returned to Rome for burial.
