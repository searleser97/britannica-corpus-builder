St. Edmund Campion,  (born January 25, 1540, London—died December 1, 1581, London; canonized October 25, 1970; feast day October 25), English Jesuit martyred by the government of Queen Elizabeth I.
The son of a London bookseller, Campion was teaching at Oxford University at the time of his ordination (1568) as a deacon in the Anglican church. But, in a crisis of conscience, he discovered that his sympathies lay with Roman Catholicism. He was received into the Catholic church at Douai in northern France and in 1573 went to Rome to become a member of the Society of Jesus.
In 1580 Campion joined the first mission that was sent by the Jesuits to minister to the Catholics of England, who were strictly forbidden to practice their religion. Unlike Robert Parsons, he carefully avoided any political involvement on behalf of his religion. After preaching at secret Catholic meetings in Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, and Lancashire, Campion created a sensation by having 400 copies of his Decem rationes (“Ten Reasons”), a pamphlet denouncing Anglicanism, distributed before a service in St. Mary’s, Oxford (June 27, 1581).
He was arrested by a spy at Lyford, Berkshire, on July 17, 1581, and taken to the Tower of London. When he refused under severe torture to recant his religious convictions, his captors invented charges that he had conspired to overthrow the queen. He was convicted of treason and executed by hanging and drawing and quartering.
Throughout his ordeal Campion exhibited religious zeal and great courage. Campion Hall at Oxford was named for him. He was canonized in 1970 by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales.
