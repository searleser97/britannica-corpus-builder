Saint Sabas, also spelled Sabbas,  (born January 439, Moutalaske, Cappadocia, Asia Minorâ€”died  Dec. 5, 532, near Jerusalem; feast day December 5), Christian Palestinian monk, champion of orthodoxy in the 5th-century controversies over the nature of Christ. He founded the monastery known as the Great Laura of Mar Saba, a renowned community of contemplative monks in the Judaean desert near Jerusalem. This community became a prototype for the subsequent development of Eastern Orthodox monasticism.
After his monastic initiation in Cappadocia, Sabas went on pilgrimage to Palestine in 457 and, having associated with several monasteries there, finally asked permission to withdraw as a solitary and to settle in the Kidron gorge, near Jerusalem, northwest of the Dead Sea. The gathering of numerous disciples about him required the construction in about 483 of a number of small cottages grouped about a chapel. From this beginning, Mar Saba established 14 monasteries and four hospices throughout southern Palestine to accommodate travelers in the Holy Land. Sabas, directed to receive priestly orders, was named spiritual head of Palestinian monasticism.
A dispute between Sabas and a monastic faction favouring the doctrines of Origen divided the community, and monasteries were established elsewhere. Sabas continued as a standardbearer of orthodoxy. He interceded at the imperial court in Constantinople against the heresy of the Monophysites. Sabas composed an influential monastic rule extant only in altered copies. He is depicted in art with an apple, denoting that he refused to eat that fruit because of its part in the biblical account of the Fall of man.
