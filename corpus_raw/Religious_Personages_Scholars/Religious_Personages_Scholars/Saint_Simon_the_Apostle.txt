Saint Simon the Apostle, also called Simon the Zealot,  (flourished 1st century ad—died, Persia or Edessa, Greece?; Western feast day October 28, Eastern feast day June 19), one of the Twelve Apostles. In the Gospels of Mark and Matthew, he bears the epithet Kananaios, or the Cananaean, often wrongly interpreted to mean “from Cana” or “from Canaan.” Kananaios is the Greek transliteration of an Aramaic word, qanʾ anaya, meaning “the Zealot,” the title given him by Luke in his Gospel and in Acts. It is uncertain whether he was one of the group of Zealots, the Jewish nationalistic party before ad 70. Apparently the titles may have been an attempt to distinguish him from the apostle St. Simon Peter.
Nothing further is known about him from the New Testament. He supposedly preached the Gospel in Egypt and then joined the apostle St. Judas (Thaddaeus) in Persia, where, according to the apocryphal Acts of Simon and Judas, he was martyred by being cut in half with a saw, one of his chief iconographic symbols (another being a book). According to St. Basil the Great, the 4th-century Cappadocian Father, Simon died peacefully at Edessa.
