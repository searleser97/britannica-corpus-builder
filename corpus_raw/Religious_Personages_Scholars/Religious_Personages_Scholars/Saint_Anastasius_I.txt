Saint Anastasius I,  (born, Rome?—died  Dec. 19, 401, Rome [Italy]; feast day December 19), pope from Nov. 27, 399, to 401, succeeding Pope Siricius.
Anastasius earned the praise of St. Jerome (Letter 127) for censuring (c. 400) the works of Origen, one of the most influential theologians of the early Greek church. In papal letters he condemned several Origenist writings, which he probably did not understand, and disapproved the spreading of Origen’s teaching. Anastasius’ virtues were praised by his admirers Saints Augustine of Hippo, Jerome, and Paulinus of Nola.
