Saint Alexander I,  (died c. 115, /119, Rome?; feast day May 3),  fifth pope after St. Peter and successor to St. Evaristus. Little is known about Alexander’s rule (c. 109–116), which is attested by Pope St. Eusebius (309/310). Some Catholic writers ascribe to him the introduction of holy water and the custom of mixing sacramental wine with water, but this is unlikely, although he may have made additions to the liturgy.  Some believe he suffered martyrdom, possibly by decapitation, under the Roman emperor Trajan or Hadrian, but this is improbable. He has sometimes been confused with St. Alexander, one of three Roman martyrs buried along the Via Nomentana. Alexander’s jailer, St. Quirinus, and his daughter St. Balbina are said to have been converted by him.
