Saint Meletius of Antioch,  (died 381, Constantinople [now Istanbul, Turkey]; feast day February 12), bishop of Antioch whose name is attached to the Meletian schism that split the church of Antioch in the 4th century.
Meletius, who was by origin Armenian, became bishop of Sebaste in 358. He was elected bishop of Antioch in late 360 or 361 when that church, tired of ecclesiastical strife over Arianism, was eager to choose a moderate person, not deeply involved in either camp. His views, however, soon incurred the displeasure of the Arian emperor Constantius II, who exiled him to Armenia. His departure from Antioch had a double effect: an Arian bishop was appointed, and an orthodox party supporting Meletius was formed. This confused situation continued until an attempt was made (362) to secure peace during the reign of the emperor Julian the Apostate. But Paulinus, a famous ascetic, was consecrated as bishop, and, Meletiusâ€™ followers refusing to accept any other bishop, the schism continued. The death of Julian and the accession of the emperor Jovian (363) brought Meletius back from exile. He refused all compromise with Paulinus, however, and Paulinus was recognized as bishop and the Meletian party remained. Jovian was succeeded (364) in the East by the Arian Valens, and the anti-Arians were again exiled. In 378 the orthodox Gratian became sole emperor and in 379 appointed Theodosius, also orthodox, emperor in the East. Again the exiled anti-Arian bishops, among them Meletius, returned to their sees. It was proposed at first that Paulinus and Meletius rule together, but when Paulinus refused to agree, Meletius was declared bishop. He presided at the Council of Constantinople (381), which accepted the Nicene Creed and ended Arianism in the empire and during which Meletius died. The schism persisted at Antioch for another 20 years.
