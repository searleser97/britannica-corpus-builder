Saint Alban,  (flourished  3rd century ad, traditionally at Verulamium, Britain; feast day June 22), first British martyr.
According to the historian Bede, he served in the Roman army and was converted to Christianity by a fugitive priest whom he sheltered and with whom he exchanged clothes, so that he was martyred in the priestâ€™s place (c. 304; other dates suggested by scholars are c. 254 or c. 209). His feast day is commemorated on June 17 in the Church of England, apparently because of misreading of the Roman numerals XXII. His tomb was venerated, and a church had been built on the site as early as 429. Later, the Abbey of St. Albans was founded there, and around it grew the town of St. Albans.
