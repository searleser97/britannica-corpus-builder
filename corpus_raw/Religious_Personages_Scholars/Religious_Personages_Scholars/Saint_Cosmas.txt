Saints Cosmas and Damian,  (respectively, born, traditionally Cilicia region, Asia Minor [Turkey]—died c. 303,  Cilicia; feast day, Eastern church, October 27; Western church, September 27; born, traditionally Cilicia region, Asia Minor [Turkey]—died c. 303,  Cilicia; feast day, Eastern church, October 27; Western church, September 27), martyrs and patron saints of physicians. They were brothers, perhaps twins, but little is known with certainty about their lives or martyrdom.
According to Christian tradition, Cosmas and Damian were educated in Syria and became distinguished physicians in Cilicia, where their charity converted many to Christianity. Because they refused payment for their services, they were called the “silverless ones.” Imprisoned during the persecution of Christians by the Roman emperor Diocletian, they were tortured and finally beheaded, their bodies being taken to Syria for burial. By the mid-5th century their cult had become so widespread that churches were erected in their honour in various Eastern cities, including Constantinople (now Istanbul). Pope Symmachus (498–514) dedicated an oratory to them, and by 530 Pope Felix IV had erected a church in their honour at Rome. Various early accounts of their lives and martyrdom gave rise to many legends.
