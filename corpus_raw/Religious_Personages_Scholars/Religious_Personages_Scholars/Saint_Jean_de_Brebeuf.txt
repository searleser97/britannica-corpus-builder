St. Jean de Brébeuf,  (born March 25, 1593, Condé-sur-Vire, Normandy, France—died March 16, 1649, Saint-Ignace, Huronia, New France [Canada]; canonized 1930; feast day October 19), Jesuit missionary to New France who became the patron saint of Canada.
Brébeuf entered the Society of Jesus in 1617, was ordained a priest in 1623, and arrived in New France in 1625. Assigned to Christianize the Huron Indians between Georgian Bay and Lake Huron, he lived in danger of death until forced by the English to return to France in 1629.
Back again in Huronia in 1634, Brébeuf laboured for 15 years in primitive surroundings. He was a veteran of 18 missions when, in 1647, peace was made between the French and the Iroquois, who were competitors with the Hurons in the fur trade and their bitter enemies. The Iroquois, determined to destroy the Huron confederacy, continued their fierce war against the Hurons and in 1648–50 destroyed all villages and missions. They seized Brébeuf and his fellow missionary Gabriel Lalemant and tortured them to death near Saint-Ignace. Brébeuf endured stoning, slashing with knives, a collar of red-hot tomahawks, a “baptism” of scalding water, and burning at the stake. Because he showed no signs of pain, his heart was eaten by the Iroquois. He was canonized with Lalemant and other Jesuits (collectively, the Martyrs of North America) in 1930.
Brébeuf’s writings, which are source materials for historians and ethnologists, include a Huron grammar and a translation of the catechism into Huron. His annual narratives are translated in R.G. Thwaites’s Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents, 73 vol. (1896–1901).
