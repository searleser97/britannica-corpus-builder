Saint Hilda of Whitby,  Hilda also spelled Hild,  (born 614, Northumbria—died  Nov. 17, 680, Whitby, Yorkshire, Eng.; feast day November 17), founder of Streaneshalch (now Whitby) Abbey and one of the foremost abbesses of Anglo-Saxon England. With Bishops SS. Colman of Lindisfarne and Cedd of the East Saxons, she led the Celtic party at the Synod of Whitby (663/664).
She was baptized (c. 627) with her great-uncle King Edwin of Northumbria. Later she became abbess of Hartlepool Abbey, Durham, and in 654/655 was entrusted with the upbringing of the daughter of King Oswiu, Edwin’s successor. The child’s name was Aelfflaed (later St. Aelfflaed). The King also gave Hilda the land on which she founded (c. 657) a double monastery of monks and nuns at Streaneshalch. Her abbey became one of the great religious centres of northeastern England. Among its members was Caedmon, the earliest English Christian poet. In 663/664 Streaneshalch housed the Synod of Whitby, summoned by Oswiu to settle the dispute over the date of Easter. Hilda supported the Celtic Church and opposed the Wilfridian party led by the Northumbrian bishop St. Wilfrid, who supported the Roman Church. Unlike Colman, Hilda submitted to Oswiu’s decision in favour of the Wilfridian party.
