Saint Kevin, Gaelic Caemgen, Latin Coemgenus,  (born, near Dublin—died June 3, 618, Glendalough, County Wicklow, Ire.; feast day June 3), one of the patron saints of Dublin, founder of the monastery of Glendalough.
The earliest life (10th/11th century?) states that Kevin was born into the royal line of the ancient Irish kingdom of Leinster and chose as a young man to become a hermit in Glendalough, where he later founded the monastery. With Kevin as abbot, it became one of Ireland’s leading monastic centres. The several lives of Kevin are largely legendary; they often represent him as a protector of animals.
