Saint Remigius of Reims, French Saint Remi, or Remy, de Reims, byname Apostle of the Franks,  (born c. 437—died January 13, c. 533, Reims, France; feast day October 1), bishop of Reims who greatly advanced the cause of Christianity in France by his conversion of Clovis I, king of the Franks.
According to tradition, Remigius was the son of Count Emilius of Laon and St. Celina (Cilinia). Noted in his youth for his eloquence and scholarship, he was consecrated bishop of Reims at the age of 22. He is known to have corresponded with Clovis, but the king, although married to a Christian, Clotilda of Burgundy (later St. Clotilda), remained indifferent to religion until two incidents changed his mind. First, the couple’s infant son was cured of an illness, and then, in 496, Clovis’s army, near defeat in a campaign against the invading Alemanni, won a sudden and decisive victory. Convinced that these favourable events were evidence of the power of Christ, Clovis sought to be converted. Along with his leading warrior chiefs, he was subsequently baptized by Remigius at Reims.
With the encouragement of Clovis and Clotilda, Remigius founded several sees and many churches and is said to have baptized more than 3,000 of the king’s soldiers. He was also credited with many miracles.
