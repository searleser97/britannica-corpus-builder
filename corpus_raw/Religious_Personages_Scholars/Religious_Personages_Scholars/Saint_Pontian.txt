Saint Pontian, Latin Pontianus,  (born, Rome [Italy]â€”died c. 236, Sardinia; feast day August 13), pope from 230 to 235 who summoned the Roman synod that confirmed the condemnation of Origen, one of the chief theologians of the early Greek Church. At the beginning of the persecution of Christians under the Roman emperor Maximinus in 235, Pontian was exiled to the mines of Sardinia with St. Hippolytus, who had opposed both Pope St. Urban I and Pontian.
While sharing their exile, Pontian and Hippolytus became reconciled. On Sept. 28, 235, Pontian abdicated to St. Anterus, the first pope to abdicate the throne of St. Peter. Pontian died a short while afterward with Hippolytus. Their deaths are traditionally thought to have been the result of ill treatment. His epitaph in the catacomb of St. Calixtus, Rome, was found in 1909; the inscription of the date of his resignation is noted as the first specific date in papal history.
