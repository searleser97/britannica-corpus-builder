Saint Hyginus,  (born, Greece?â€”died c. 140, Rome; feast day January 11), pope from about 136 to about 140. Hyginus had been a philospher, possibly in Athens, before moving to Rome. The Liber Pontificalis credits him with organizing the hierarchy (ranks of the ruling body of clergy), but the same claim is made for Hormisdas. His pontificate witnessed the beginning in Rome of the cults formed around belief as esoteric knowledge of spiritual truth, which came to be known as the Gnostic heresies.
