Saint Sixtus II,  (born, Greece?—died  Aug. 6, 258, Rome [Italy]; feast day August 7), pope from 257 to 258, one of the early Roman Church’s most venerated martyrs.
He was elected in August 257 to succeed Pope St. Stephen I, during whose pontificate there arose a conflict with certain Eastern churches over the rebaptism of converted heretics. Although Stephen firmly upheld the Roman rule that rendered rebaptism unnecessary, Sixtus, supposedly influenced by Bishop St. Dionysius the Great of Alexandria, adopted a more conciliatory attitude by tolerating the Eastern policies of rebaptism. He thus restored relations with those churches that had been severed by Stephen because of the conflict and sent an envoy to Bishop St. Cyprian of Carthage, Stephen’s opponent.
Shortly after Sixtus’ election, the Roman emperor Valerian promulgated his first decree against the Christians, and a violent persecution ensued. For protection, Sixtus gathered (Aug. 6, 258) his congregation for services in the subterranean cemetery of Praetextatus on the Appian Way. There, he and four deacons, Saints Januarius, Vincent, Magnus, and Stephen, were seized and either beheaded immediately or brought to court and returned for execution. Buried in the nearby cemetery of Callistus, Sixtus later became one of the most revered martyrs of the early church.
Subsequent legend wrongly claims his martyrdom by crucifixion. His alleged authorship of the Sentences of Sextus (a collection of maxims on spiritual perfection) is dubious.
