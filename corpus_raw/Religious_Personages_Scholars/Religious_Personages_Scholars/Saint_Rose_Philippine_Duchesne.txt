St. Rose Philippine Duchesne,  (born August 29, 1769, Grenoble, France—died November 18, 1852, St. Charles, Missouri, U.S.; canonized July 3, 1988; feast day November 18), missionary who founded the first convents of the Society of the Sacred Heart in the United States.
Duchesne was born into a wealthy family with high political and financial connections. In 1780 she went to study at a convent and, despite her father’s opposition, entered the Visitation Order in Grenoble in 1788. When the community was dispersed by the French Revolution (1792), she did charitable works for nine years. After vainly trying to reestablish the Visitandines in their convent of Sainte-Marie-d’en-Haut, she turned the convent over to the newly founded Society of the Sacred Heart in 1804 and was received by its founder, St. Madeleine Sophie Barat.
For 14 years Mother Duchesne prepared for a missionary career, during which time she founded the first Sacred Heart convent in Paris (1815). In 1818 she headed a band of five nuns, the first to pioneer U.S. territory west of the Mississippi. At St. Charles, in the soon-to-be state of Missouri, the women opened a free school and a boarding academy, moving in 1819 to Florissant, Missouri, where they founded an orphanage and a novitiate. Two convent schools were founded in Louisiana, at Grand Coteau (1821) and St. Michael’s (1825), and an academy and orphanage in St. Louis, Missouri (1827). The house at St. Charles was reopened in 1828.
At the invitation of the Jesuit missionary Father Pierre-Jean de Smet, Mother Duchesne in 1841 was sent to the Indian mission among the Potawatomi at Sugar Creek (in present-day Kansas), remaining there in ill health for one year. She spent the last decade of her life at St. Charles, where a memorial church was built in her honour. She was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1988.
