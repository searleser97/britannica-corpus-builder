St. Frances Xavier Cabrini, byname Mother Cabrini, original name Maria Francesca Cabrini,  (born July 15, 1850, Sant’Angelo Lodigiano, Lombardy [Italy]—died December 22, 1917, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.; canonized July 7, 1946; feast day November 13), Italian-born founder of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart and the first United States citizen to be canonized.
Maria Cabrini was the youngest of 13 children, only four of whom survived to adulthood. She was determined from her childhood to make religious work her life’s vocation. After teaching in Italy in Vidardo (1872–74), she was appointed supervisor of an orphanage in Codogno (1874). In 1877 she took her vows and changed her name in honour of St. Francis Xavier, the patron saint of missionaries; soon after, she became known as Mother Cabrini.
She founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart in 1880, which served orphans and offered a day school. She planned to found a convent in China, but Pope Leo XIII directed her to “go west, not east,” and she sailed with a small group of sisters for the United States in 1889. Their work in the United States was to be concentrated among the neglected Italian immigrants. This journey was the first in a series that took her through the Americas and into Europe. She became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1909. Although plagued by ill health most of the time, Mother Cabrini established 67 houses—one for each year of her life—in such cities as Buenos Aires, Paris, Madrid, and Rio de Janeiro. She also founded several schools, hospitals, and orphanages.
