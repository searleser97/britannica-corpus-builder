Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln,  (born 1245, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, Eng.—died  Aug. 27, 1255, Lincoln; feast day August 27 [suppressed]), legendary English child martyr who was supposedly murdered by members of the local Jewish community for ritual purposes. There was little basis in fact for the story, but the cult that grew up around Hugh was a typical expression of the anti-Semitism that flourished in Europe after the year 1000.
The victim of an anonymous murder, Hugh, a 9-year-old boy, was found dead in a well. His friends came forth with the accusation that a Jew named Koppin had imprisoned the child for more than a month, torturing and finally crucifying him. According to rumour, the body had been thrown into the well because the earth had refused to receive it. More than 90 Jews were subsequently arrested and charged with practicing ritual murder. Koppin, who allegedly confessed, was executed along with 18 others.
Miracles began to be attributed to Hugh as soon as the body was discovered. The story, although lacking any evidence, grew both in detail and in popularity over the years and, like others of its kind, reinforced the nearly universal sentiment of anti-Semitism and provided additional fuel for anti-Jewish acts. The legend of Hugh’s martyrdom was a popular subject in medieval literature, notably in Chaucer’s Prioress’s Tale. His name does not appear in the standard Butler’s Lives of the Saints (1998).
