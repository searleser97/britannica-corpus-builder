Saint Hilary of Poitiers, Latin Hilarius,  (born c. 315, Poitiers, Gaul—died c. 367, Poitiers; feast day January 13), Gallo-Roman doctor of the church who as bishop of Poitiers was a champion of orthodoxy against Arianism (q.v.) and was the first Latin writer to introduce Greek doctrine to Western Christendom.
A convert from Neoplatonism, Hilary was elected bishop of Poitiers (c. 353). He was exiled (356–360) to Phrygia by the Roman emperor Constantius II for not condemning the leading opponent of Arianism, St. Athanasius the Great, at the Council of Béziers (356).
While in Phrygia, he wrote De trinitate (The Trinity), the first work in Latin to deal with the issues of the Trinitarian controversies. In De synodis (“Concerning the Synods”) he explained the history of the Arian controversy and directed the faithful in the East to rally against those who believed the Son was unlike the Father. His appeals to Constantius were unsuccessful, and he was expelled from the East. Returning to Poitiers, he spent his last years combatting Arianism in Gaul and writing his commentary on the Psalms and Tractatus mysteriorum on typology. His reaffirmation of orthodoxy, almost alone in Gaul, earned him the title of the Athanasius of the West. Probably the earliest hymnist, he composed a book of lyrics (c. 360). He was declared a doctor of the church in 1851 by Pope Pius IX.
