St. Gaius, Gaius also spelled Caius,  (born, Dalmatia? [now in Croatia]—died April 22?, 296, Rome [Italy]; feast day April 22), pope from 283 (possibly December 17) to 296. Nothing about him is known with certainty. Supposedly a relative of the Roman emperor Diocletian, who was known for his heavy persecution of Christians, Gaius conducted his pontificate during a period of Diocletian’s reign when Christians were tacitly tolerated. Nevertheless, Gaius is  said to have carried on his religious work for his last eight years concealed in the catacombs. His epitaph was found in the Cemetery of Calixtus.
