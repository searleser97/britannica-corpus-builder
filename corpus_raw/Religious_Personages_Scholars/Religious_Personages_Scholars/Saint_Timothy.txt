Saint Timothy,  (born, Lystra, Lycaonia [now Lusna, Tur.]—died ad 97, Ephesus [now in Turkey]; Western feast day January 24 [in Roman church January 26 with Titus], Eastern feast day January 22), disciple of St. Paul the Apostle, whom he accompanied on his missions; traditional martyr and first bishop of Ephesus.
On his second visit to Lystra in 50, Paul discovered Timothy, taking him as a colleague but first circumcising him out of respect for his Jewish mother and the custom of the Jews in whose communities they were to do mission work (Acts 16:1–3). Timothy worked with Paul and Silas and helped found churches, notably in Corinth, Thessalonica, and Philippi. He apparently accompanied Paul to Ephesus and Asia Minor (Acts 19:22; 1 Corinthians 16:10–11). As the presence of his name in the first verses of Colossians, Philemon, and Philippians indicates, he was subsequently associated with Paul’s imprisonment at Ephesus. In the Pastoral Epistles he is solely in charge of the Christians at Ephesus, possibly the site of his release from prison as chronicled in Hebrews 13:23.
Tradition, probably based on New Testament inferences, made him first bishop of Ephesus, where he was allegedly martyred under the Roman emperor Nerva. One legend asserts that he was clubbed to death by a mob for protesting against the orgiastic worship of the goddess Artemis.
Paul’s two Pastoral Epistles addressed to Timothy reveal concern for his well-being, and he is praised in 1 Corinthians, Philippians, and Romans. He is also mentioned in 1 and 2 Thessalonians and 2 Corinthians. St. John of Damascus states that Timothy witnessed the end of the life of the Virgin Mary.
