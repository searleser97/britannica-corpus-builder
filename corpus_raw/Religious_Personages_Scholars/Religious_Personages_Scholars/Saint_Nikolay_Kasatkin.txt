Saint Nikolay Kasatkin, original name Ivan Dmitrovich Kasatkin, Kasatkin also spelled Kassatkin,  (born Aug. 13, 1836, Smolensk, Russia—died  Feb. 16, 1912, Tokyo, Japan), Russian Orthodox missionary and first Orthodox bishop of Japan.
Kasatkin, who adopted the name Nikolay when he took monastic vows, went to Japan in 1861 as chaplain to the Russian consulate in Hakodate. Because Christianity was a prohibited religion in Japan, he spent his first years in the Orient learning the Japanese language and culture, eventually celebrating Orthodox ceremonies in Japanese in the embassy chapel. By 1868 he had baptized his first three converts. As the number of converts grew, the Holy Synod created a regular mission for Japan in 1871. The laws against Christianity were lifted in 1873, and by 1874 the Orthodox community consisted of 400 Japanese converts. Kasatkin encouraged the autonomous aspects of the church, recruiting clergy from among the Japanese; in 1875 two of the original converts were ordained priests, and in 1880 Kasatkin was consecrated bishop.
Although the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05) strained relations between the Russian and Japanese Orthodox churches, the Japanese Orthodox church continued to grow and Nikolay remained loyal to it, becoming archbishop in 1906. At his death in 1912, the church was a self-supporting autonomous body numbering over 30,000 converts.
