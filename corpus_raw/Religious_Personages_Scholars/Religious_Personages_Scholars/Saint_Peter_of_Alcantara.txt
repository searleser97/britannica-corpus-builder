Saint Peter of Alcántara, Spanish San Pedro de Alcántara, original name Pedro Garavito,  (born 1499, Alcántara, Spain—died October 18, 1562, Arenas; canonized 1669; feast day October 19), Franciscan mystic who founded an austere form of Franciscan life known as the Alcantarines or Discalced (i.e., barefooted) Friars Minor. He is the patron saint of Brazil.
Of noble birth, he entered the Franciscan order at Alcántara in 1515 and was ordained a priest in 1524. As a friar, Peter emphasized the penitential aspects of the life of St. Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscans. He then wrote special instructions for his disciples and in Spain and Portugal founded convents that were unique for their isolation and discomfort. From his first friary at El Pedroso, Spain, his friars spread to Italy, Germany, and France.
Peter had spirited correspondence with Francis Borgia, with Louis of Granada, and especially with the mystical writer Teresa of Ávila, whom he aided in her reform of the Carmelite nuns and whose autobiography is one of the best sources on his life. Peter’s Tratado de la oración y meditación (Treatise on Prayer and Meditation) has been translated into numerous languages (Eng. trans., 1926).
