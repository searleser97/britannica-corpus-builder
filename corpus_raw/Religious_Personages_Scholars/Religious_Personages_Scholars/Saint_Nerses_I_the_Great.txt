St. Nerses I the Great, Nerses also written Nersess,  (born c. 310—died 373?; feast day, November 19), patriarch of the Armenian church from about 353. A descendant of St. Gregory the Illuminator (240–332), who converted the Armenian king to Christianity and became the first patriarch of Armenia, Nerses was the most important figure in the country during his patriarchate. He established monastic and charitable institutions and schools and has been called the founder of Christian charity in Armenia. Originally one of the chief advisers of the Arian king Arshag (also spelled Arshak), he was exiled for nine years for denouncing the king’s murder of the queen; he returned upon the king’s death in battle. He soon broke with Arshag’s heir, King Pap (also spelled Bab), over his fostering of religious ties with the court of Constantinople. It is said that their political and religious friction, coupled with Nerses’ condemnation of Pap’s moral depravity, led Pap to instigate Nerses’ murder by poisoning at a royal banquet.
