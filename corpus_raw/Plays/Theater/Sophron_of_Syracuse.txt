Sophron Of Syracuse,   (flourished c. 430 bc), author of rhythmical prose mimes in the Doric dialect. Although the mimes survive mostly in fragments of only a few words, it can be seen from their titles—e.g., The Tunny-fisher, The Sempstress, etc.—that they depicted scenes from daily life. One longer fragment deals with a magical ceremony. Plato thought highly of Sophron, who had some influence on Theocritus and also on Herodas.
