Neil Simon, in full Marvin Neil Simon,  (born July 4, 1927, Bronx, New York, U.S.—died August 26, 2018, New York City), American playwright, screenwriter, television writer, and librettist who was one of the most popular playwrights in the history of the American theatre.
Simon was raised in New York City and had a difficult childhood. His parents’ relationship was volatile, and his father left the family on a number of occasions. The younger Simon later studied at New York University and at the University of Denver. In the late 1940s and throughout the ’50s, he worked as a comedy writer for various television shows, perhaps most notably Your Show of Shows and Caesar’s Hour. During this time, he often collaborated with his brother, Danny Simon.
In 1961 Neil’s autobiographical play Come Blow Your Horn opened on Broadway and became a smash success, running for two years. The plays that followed proved extremely popular with audiences and usually had very long runs on Broadway. They included Barefoot in the Park (1963; film 1967); The Odd Couple (1965; film 1968), for which he won the Tony Award for best author; The Star-Spangled Girl (1966; film 1971); Plaza Suite (1968; film 1971); Last of the Red Hot Lovers (1969; film 1972); The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1971; film 1975); The Sunshine Boys (1972; film 1975); California Suite (1976; film 1978); Chapter Two (1977; film 1979); and I Ought to Be in Pictures (1980; film 1982). He also penned a trilogy of autobiographical plays consisting of Brighton Beach Memoirs (1983; film 1986); Biloxi Blues (1985; film 1988), which was awarded the Tony for best play; and Broadway Bound (1986; television movie 1992). Subsequent plays included Rumors (1988); Lost in Yonkers (1991; film 1993), which won both a Pulitzer Prize and the Tony Award for best play; and The Dinner Party (2000).
In addition, Simon wrote the screenplays for motion-picture adaptations of his plays as well as for a number of original films. He received Academy Award nominations for his screenplays for The Odd Couple (1968), The Sunshine Boys (1975), The Goodbye Girl (1977), and California Suite (1978). In 1993 Simon adapted The Goodbye Girl into a popular stage musical. He wrote the books for other musicals, including Little Me (1962), Sweet Charity (1966), Promises, Promises (1968), and They’re Playing Our Song (1979).
The everyday lives and domestic problems of ordinary middle-class people are the focus of Simon’s plays, which examine his characters’ marital and other dilemmas and, for comic effect, play up the incongruity of their situations. Simon wrote two volumes of memoirs, Rewrites (1996) and The Play Goes On (1999). In 2006 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.
