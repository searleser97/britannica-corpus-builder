John Day,  (born 1574, Cawston, Norfolk, Eng.—died  1640?), Elizabethan dramatist whose verse allegory The Parliament of Bees shows unusual ingenuity and delicacy of imagination.
Day was expelled from the University of Cambridge in 1593 for theft, and after 1598 he became a playwright for the theatre proprietor and manager Philip Henslowe. In this capacity Day collaborated with Thomas Dekker, Henry Chettle, and some lesser-known writers. His first extant play is The Blind-Beggar of Bednal-Green (written in 1600, with Chettle; published 1659). Among his other plays are The Isle of Gulls (1606) and Humour Out of Breath (1608). Day’s reputation rests mainly on The Parliament of Bees, published posthumously in 1641 and probably written near the end of his life. This exquisite masque, which is actually a series of pastoral eclogues, is about “the doings, the births, the wars, the wooings” of bees. The bees hold a parliament under Prorex, the “Master Bee,” and grievances are presented against the bumblebee, the wasp, the drone, and other insects whom the author uses to represent various human types. The satirical allegory ends with a royal progress of the fairy king Oberon, who dispenses justice among the bees.
