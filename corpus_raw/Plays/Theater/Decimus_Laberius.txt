Decimus Laberius,  (born c. 105 bcâ€”died  43 bc), Roman knight with a caustic wit who was one of the two leading writers of mimes. In 46 or 45 bc he was compelled by Julius Caesar to accept the challenge of his rival, Publilius Syrus, and appear in one of his own mimes; the dignified prologue that he pronounced on this degradation has survived, quoted by the 4th-century-ad author Macrobius (Saturnalia). He introduced into his mime a Syrian slave, in mockery of Publilius, who had once been a slave. Caesar awarded the prize to Publilius but restored Laberius to his equestrian rank, which he had forfeited by appearing as a mime. The titles of 43 mimes have been preserved, with 178 lines.
