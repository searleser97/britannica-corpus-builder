John Guare,  (born February 5, 1938, New York, New York, U.S.), American playwright known for his innovative and often absurdist dramas.
Guare, who at age 11 produced his first play for friends and family, was educated at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. (B.A., 1960), and at Yale University (M.F.A., 1963). He then began staging short plays, primarily in New York City, where he helped to found the Eugene O’Neill Memorial Theatre Playwrights’ Conference. His first notable works—Muzeeka (1968), about American soldiers of the Vietnam War who have television contracts, and Cop-Out (1968)—satirize the American media.
In 1971 Guare earned critical acclaim for The House of Blue Leaves (filmed for television, 1987), a farce about a zookeeper who murders his insane wife after he fails as a songwriter. Two Gentlemen of Verona (1972; with Mel Shapiro), a rock-musical modernization of William Shakespeare’s comedy, won the Tony and New York Drama Critics Circle awards for best musical of 1971–72. Guare dealt with such issues as success—in Marco Polo Sings a Solo (1977) and Rich and Famous (1977)—and parent-child relationships—in Landscape of the Body (1978) and Bosoms and Neglect (1980). The plays Lydie Breeze (1982), Gardenia (1982), and Women and Water (1990) make up a family saga set in Nantucket, Massachusetts, in the second half of the 19th century.
Other works included Four Baboons Adoring the Sun, and Other Plays (1993) and The War Against the Kitchen Sink (1996). His one-act play The General of Hot Desire, first performed in 1998, is an unsympathetic adaptation of the Bible that takes as one of its starting points Shakespeare’s sonnet number 154, from which the title of the play is taken. Lake Hollywood (2000) chronicles the lives of dissatisfied people and the futility of their idolization of celebrities, and Chaucer in Rome (2002), a sequel to The House of Blue Leaves, satirizes art, religion, and fame. A Few Stout Individuals (2003) is a colourful account of the memories and delusions of a dying Ulysses S. Grant.
Later plays included 3 Kinds of Exile (2013), which premiered Off-Broadway and starred Guare, and A Free Man of Color (2010). Guare also wrote several screenplays, notably Atlantic City (1980), for which he received an Academy Award nomination, and the 1993 adaptation of his play Six Degrees of Separation.
