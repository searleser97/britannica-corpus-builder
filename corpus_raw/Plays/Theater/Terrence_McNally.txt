Terrence McNally,  (born November 3, 1938, St. Petersburg, Florida, U.S.—died March 24, 2020, Sarasota, Florida), American dramatist whose plays explore human relationships—frequently those of gay men—and are typically characterized by dark humour. He also wrote books for musicals.
As a young man, McNally worked as a newspaper reporter, as a tutor for the children of the American novelist John Steinbeck, and as a stage manager at The Actors Studio. His early plays included Bad Habits (produced 1971), The Ritz (originally produced as The Tubs, 1973; film 1976), and Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune (produced 1987; film 1991). In 1995 McNally won a Tony Award for best play, for Love! Valour! Compassion! (film 1997), and he won another the following year for Master Class, one of several works he wrote about opera.
McNally’s Corpus Christi generated controversy upon its 1998 premiere for its depiction of a Christ-like character as homosexual. Among his later plays were Deuce, which opened on Broadway in 2007, and Golden Age, which followed in 2012. In his play Mothers and Sons (2014), McNally examined a mother coming to terms with her late son’s homosexuality and with society’s evolving understanding of what constitutes a family. Fire and Air (2018) is about the Ballets Russes and founder Serge Diaghilev’s relationship with Vaslav Nijinsky.
McNally’s librettos for Kiss of the Spider Woman and Ragtime won him Tony Awards in 1993 and 1998, respectively. Additional credits as a librettist included The Full Monty (produced 2000), Catch Me if You Can (produced 2011), and The Visit (produced 2001). He earned an additional Tony nomination for a 2015 revival of the latter musical. Four years later he received a Tony for lifetime achievement.
