Tom Taylor,  (born October 19, 1817, Bishopwearmouth, Durham, England—died July 12, 1880, Wandsworth, England), English journalist and biographer and also one of the most popular dramatists of his time. He is perhaps best known today as the author of the play Our American Cousin (1858) and as a longtime staff member and, from 1874, the editor of the magazine Punch.
After attending school in Sunderland and studying at the University of Glasgow, Taylor in 1837 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow. For two years he held the professorship of English literature at University College London. He was called to the bar at Middle Temple in November 1846 and went on the northern circuit. In 1850 he became assistant secretary of the Board of Health. The board was reconstituted in 1854 in response to the cholera epidemic that was ravaging London, and Taylor was made secretary, a post he held until 1858, when the board came to an end. Taylor was moved to a department of the Home Office, from which he retired in 1876.
While working as a civil servant, Taylor maintained separate careers as a playwright and a journalist. He had shown a talent for drama from an early age, and, as a child, he performed dramatic pieces at a brewer’s stable. The Lyceum Theatre hosted four of his burlesques in 1844, and the following year he had his first hit there with To Parents and Guardians. He also wrote additional burlesques with Albert Smith and Charles Kenny and collaborated with Charles Reade on Masks and Faces (1852). Over the span of three decades, Taylor wrote more than 100 dramatic pieces. Among his most popular works during his lifetime were Still Waters Run Deep (1855), Victims (1857), The Contested Election (1859), The Overland Route (1860), The Ticket of Leave Man (1863), Joan of Arc (1871), and Anne Boleyn (1875).
After Taylor’s Our American Cousin opened in London in 1858, theatre manager Laura Keene brought the comedy to the United States for a hugely successful run in New York. On April 14, 1865, U.S. Pres. Abraham Lincoln was shot while attending a performance of it in Washington, D.C. Keene, who was appearing in one of the lead roles, identified John Wilkes Booth as the assassin.
Taylor’s work as a journalist began when he first moved to London in the late 1830s. He soon became connected with The Morning Chronicle and the Daily News, where he wrote ledes. He was on the staff of Punch and was named editor in 1874. He also had some talent for painting, and for many years he was an art critic for The Times and the Graphic.
