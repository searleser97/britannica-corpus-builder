Ewan MacColl, original name James Miller,  (born Jan. 25, 1915, Auchterarder, Scot.—died  Oct. 22, 1989, London, Eng.), British singer, songwriter, and playwright.
MacColl’s parents were singers and taught him many folk songs. He left school at 14, taking a variety of blue-collar jobs and working as a singer and actor. In 1945 he and Joan Littlewood founded Theatre Workshop; he was the company’s artistic director until 1953 and wrote a number of plays for it. MacColl was a leading figure in the British folk-song revival of the 1950s and ’60s. He and his third wife, American musician Peggy Seeger, pioneered a type of documentary, the “radio-ballad,” combining recorded interviews with songs and narration. The two published several collections of folk songs, including Till Doomsday in the Afternoon (1986). Among MacColl’s best-known songs is “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face.”
