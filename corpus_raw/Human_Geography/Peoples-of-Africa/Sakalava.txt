Sakalava,  a Malagasy people living in the western third of Madagascar. The Sakalava live in a sparsely populated area of vast plains, grasslands, and rolling foothills.
The Sakalava formed the first major Malagasy kingdom, which developed along the southwestern coast in the late 16th century. Splitting into two allied kingdoms in the mid-17th century, the Sakalava reached the height of their power in the next century; their rule extended over nearly half of the entire island, and they carried on a lively trade in cattle and slaves with Europeans in exchange for guns and other manufactured goods. The Sakalava state declined in the late 18th century, however, and nominal hegemony in the area passed to the expanding kingdom of the Merina. In the 1890s the French subdued both the Sakalava and the Merina, and the Sakalava were integrated into the newly established French colony.
The Sakalava are primarily seminomadic pastoralists who let their herds roam freely over the grasslands of their native provinces. They also practice limited agriculture, sowing rice in riverbeds. They have benefited from the progressive cultivation practices of other ethnic groups, such as the Merina and Betsileo, who have migrated to the Sakalavaâ€™s thinly populated region in search of farmland.
