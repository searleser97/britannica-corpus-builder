Saho,  people of the coastal plains of southern Eritrea. Traditional Saho culture involved considerable mobility, because people needed to move their herds of camels, sheep, goats, and, more recently, cattle from summer pasture to winter pasture each year. However, the Saho have become increasingly settled since the mid-20th century. Most of the Saho are Muslims who practice Ṣūfism, or Islamic mysticism, but some groups, including the Minifere and the Debri-Mela, include both Muslims and Christians. The Saho numbered some 250,000 in the early 21st century.
