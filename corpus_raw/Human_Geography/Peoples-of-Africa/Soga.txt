Soga, also called Basoga,  an Interlacustrine Bantu-speaking people inhabiting the area east of the Nile River between Lakes Victoria and Kyoga. They are the fourth largest ethnic group in Uganda. Culturally, they are very similar to the Ganda, who inhabit the region immediately to the west. Prosperous by national standards, the Soga are primarily agriculturists, growing bananas and millet and cash crops such as coffee and cotton. Animal husbandry is important, cattle being the chief stock.
The Soga were traditionally organized into a number of small chiefdoms. The constituent clans of these chiefdoms have remained important. These clans, patrilineal in descent, number in the hundreds. The Soga were recognized as a separate administrative district in the Uganda Protectorate.
Today, most Soga are Christian. Their traditional beliefs centred on spirits associated with ancestors or nature.
