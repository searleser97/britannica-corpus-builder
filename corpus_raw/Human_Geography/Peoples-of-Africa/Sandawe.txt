Sandawe,  a people living near Kondoa, Tanzania, between the Bubu and Mponde rivers, and speaking one of the three branches of the Khoisan languages.
Many aspects of their culture show the influence of their Bantu neighbours. Their isolated wooden houses with roofs of clay are built in the lee of the wind. The staple food is millet, supplemented with fat, milk, and butter, meat being rarely eaten. Their traditional clothes were of hika-grass, feathers, and hides, and the dominant cosmetic practices include shaving of hair, earlobe piercing, and face tattooing.
The Sandawe cultivate the soil with a mattock, fertilize with manure, and keep cattle, sheep, and goats. The men clear the land, tend the animals, and hunt, while the women do the cultivation and food gathering.
Households, each comprising a nuclear family, are organized into patrilineal exogamous clans that form the basis for autonomous local communities. Marriage, which is monogamous and requires bridewealth, is forbidden with parallel cousins and preferred with the maternal uncle’s daughter. Residence is patrilocal, often after an initial period near the wife’s parents.
