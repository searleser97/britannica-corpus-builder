Tigre, also spelled Tigray, or Tigrai,  people inhabiting northwestern Eritrea and limited areas of neighbouring Sudan. The Tigre speak Tigré, a Semitic language related to ancient Geʿez and to modern Tigrinya, the language of the Tigray people.
The largest federation of Tigre is that of the Amer (Beni Amer), a branch of the historically important Beja peoples. These Muslims all recognize the religious supremacy of the Mirghanīyah family of eastern Sudan. Another group, the Bet-Asgade (Bet Asgede), converted from Ethiopic Christianity to Islam. The life of the nomadic herdsman, so characteristic of neighbouring Sudan, is followed by most Tigre. The group accounted for nearly one-third of the population of Eritrea in the late 20th century. Compare Tigray (people).
