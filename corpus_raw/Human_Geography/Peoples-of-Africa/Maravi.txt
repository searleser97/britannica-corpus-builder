Maravi,  cluster of nine Bantu-speaking peoples living in the tree-studded grasslands of Malawi and along the lower Zambezi River. The two largest groups are the Chewa (or Cewa) and the Nyanja. Their economy is based mainly on agriculture, corn (maize) being the staple crop. Hunting, fishing, and trading are also important economically. The Maravi are thought to be of Congo origin, and, like other groups from that region, such as the Bemba, they are divided into matrilineal clans. Descent, succession, and inheritance are also matrilineal. Polygyny is practiced, the first wife enjoying special status; the typical family comprises a husband, his wives, and dependent children.
