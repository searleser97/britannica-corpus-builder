Sidamo, also spelled Sidama,  any of the Cushitic-speaking peoples of southwestern Ethiopia who are not Oromo; they are mostly concentrated in the Omo River and Rift Valley regions. The Sidamo founded the Kefa kingdom in about ad 1400 and were subsequently controlled by both the “Abyssinians” (Amhara and Tigray) and the Oromo, whose invasions pressed them into their present geographic boundaries.
Most Sidamo have retained their traditional religion based on worship of the sky god. Their political organization is monarchical: a divine king is a representative of the sky god. The region shows the extraordinary military-mindedness of past epochs, with entire communities surrounded by walls and garrisons.
The staple crop of the Sidamo is the ensete, or Abyssinian banana, but they also produce grains, cereals, vegetables, fruits, and spices. They keep herds of cattle, horses, and sheep. The Sidamo numbered almost 2,000,000 in the late 20th century.
