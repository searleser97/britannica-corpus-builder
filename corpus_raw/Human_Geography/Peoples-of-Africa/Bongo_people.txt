Bongo, also spelled Bungu,  a people once extensive in the western area of present-day South Sudan, now found in small, scattered settlements south and east of Wau. They speak a Central Sudanic language of the Nilo-Saharan language family. Because they were separated by miles of bush, the various Bongo subgroups were only loosely affiliated; this lack of cooperation was decisive in their decimation by waves of invaders from the 18th century on. Chiefs had little authority, although they were consulted in important legal and social matters. The Bongo now live along roads, subsist largely on the cultivation of sorghum, eleusine (finger millet), sesame, and tobacco, and raise chickens and a few sheep and goats. Famed as hunters, they spend each dry season hunting and fishing, using poisoned arrows and spears, nets, traps, and snares. Noted also for their metalwork, the Bongo supplied neighbouring peoples with iron tools until imported iron replaced locally smelted iron ore.
