Lobi,   people residing in the western region of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) and in the Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and speaking a Gur language of the Niger-Congo family. They are farmers and hunters, growing millet and sorghum as staples. Traditionally, the Lobi governed themselves through the clan system, with no formal political organization.
Religious beliefs were purely animistic until Islamic influence entered the area around the 14th century. Polygyny is practiced. In 1897, France annexed the Lobi lands, but because of the Lobi’s effective use of poisoned arrows the population was not subdued until 1903.
