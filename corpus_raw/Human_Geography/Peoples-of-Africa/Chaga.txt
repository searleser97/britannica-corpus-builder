Chaga, also spelled Chagga,  Bantu-speaking people living on the fertile southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania. They are one of the wealthiest and most highly organized of Tanzanian peoples.
Chaga land and cultivation methods support a very dense population. They practice an intensive irrigated agriculture on terraced fields, keeping the fields under permanent cultivation through the use of animal manure as fertilizer. The staple crop is millet; plantains are also important. Since the 1920s coffee has been the major cash crop.
Chaga society follows patrilineal rules of descent and inheritance. Polygyny is general. Males are grouped in age sets similar to those of the Masai.
The Chaga are descended from immigrants of various groups who migrated into the once forest-covered foothills. Most of the 400 main clans are of Kamba origin; others are from Teita, Masai, and other peoples. The Chaga have a relatively egalitarian social system. Traditionally, Chagaland was divided into a number of politically independent chiefdoms. There was, however, no paramount chief until Marealle was established in that position by the German administration in 1893.
