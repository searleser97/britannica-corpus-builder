Nandi,  Kalenjin-speaking people who inhabit the western part of the highlands of Kenya. Their dialect of Kalenjin is classified in the Nilotic branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family; they are distinct from the Nandi of Congo (Kinshasa), whose language is classified as Niger-Congo.
The Nandi of Kenya are primarily intensive cultivators; their major crops are millet, corn (maize), and sweet potatoes (yams). Cattle serve many functions, providing food and bride-price payments and holding great ritual significance.
The people are divided among 17 patrilineal and exogamous clans dispersed throughout Nandi territory. The most important traditional social groups are the age sets, to one of which every male belongs from birth. The Nandi age grade system is of the cyclical type, with seven named grades covering approximately 15 years each, a single full cycle being 105 years. Men advance through the warrior grades and, upon entering the grade of elder, hold political and judicial authority. No political authority transcends this local council of elders.
General polygyny is the rule, with substantial bride-price in livestock expected. Nandi society was traditionally egalitarian.
