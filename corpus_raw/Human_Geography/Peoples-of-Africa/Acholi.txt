Acholi, also spelled Acoli, also called Gang or Shuli,  ethnolinguistic group of northern Uganda and South Sudan. Numbering more than one million at the turn of the 21st century, they speak a Western Nilotic language of the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family and are culturally and historically related to their traditional enemies, the neighbouring Lango. The Acholi are the descendants of a variety of Luo-speaking peoples who are believed to have migrated three or four centuries ago from adjacent areas of what is now South Sudan into what is now the Acholi district of Uganda.
The Acholi have small chiefdoms of one or more villages, each with several patrilineal clans. Chiefs are chosen from one lineage. The Acholi live in small hamlets among patrilineal kin. They keep sheep and cattle but are not as committed to pastoralism as some other Nilotic peoples are. Millet is the staple food of the Acholi, and tobacco is grown for trade. Corn (maize), sorghum, beans, squash, peanuts (groundnuts), and other savanna crops also are grown. Hunting tracts are owned by clans. Stream and swamp fishing are important.
The Acholi were considered a martial people by the British, and many joined the military. Under Ugandan Pres. Idi Amin (1971–79) the Acholi were severely persecuted and their men systematically executed for their past association with the colonial army and for their support of Pres. Milton Obote (1962–71, 1980–85).
