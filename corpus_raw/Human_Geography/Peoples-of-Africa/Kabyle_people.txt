Kabyle,   Berber people of Algeria inhabiting a partially mountainous region stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the southern slopes of the Great Kabylie mountains and from Dellys to Cape Aokas. Numbering about 2,000,000 in the late 20th century, they are mainly Muslims with a few Christians and are predominantly agricultural, growing grains and olives and herding goats. Their language, Kabyle (also called Zouaouah, or Zwāwah), is a Berber language of the Afro-Asiatic (formerly Hamito-Semitic) family.
Traditionally, each village was administered by an assembly of adult males (those old enough to observe the fast of Ramaḍān). A code of customary law dealt with all questions of property and persons as well as crimes and general offenses. Villages are divided into rival clans, and the society is organized into castes, with smiths and butchers ordinarily kept at a distance, and a serf (earlier slave) class.
Traditional dress for men includes a loosely flowing robe, a woolen burnoose draped over a woolen skullcap, and a broad-brimmed straw hat. Women wear bright cotton garments, usually woven in serpentlike stripes, and a silk scarf covers the head.
