Kongo, also called Bakongo,  group of Bantu-speaking peoples related through language and culture and dwelling along the Atlantic coast of Africa from Pointe-Noire, Congo (Brazzaville), in the north, to Luanda, Angola, in the south. In the east, their territory is limited by the Kwango River and in the northeast by Malebo (Stanley) Pool, in the Congo River. The Kongo thus live in Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Kinshasa), and Angola, and they numbered about 10,220,000 at the end of the 20th century. Their language is part of the Benue-Congo branch of the Niger-Congo languages.
The Kongo cultivate cassava, bananas, corn (maize), sweet potatoes, peanuts (groundnuts), beans, and taro. Cash crops are coffee, cacao, urena, bananas, and palm oil. Fishing and hunting are still practiced by some groups, but many Kongo live and work or trade in towns.
Descent is reckoned through the female line, and kinship is further organized through lineages. The main characteristic of social organization is fragmentation: nearly every village is independent of its neighbours, and almost nothing remains of the ancient Kongo kingdom. The Kongo religion centres on ancestor and spirit cults, which also play a part in social and political organization. A strong tradition of prophetism and messianism among the Kongo gave rise in the 20th century to nativistic, political-religious movements.
