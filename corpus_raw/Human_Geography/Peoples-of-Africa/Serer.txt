Serer, also spelled Sereer,  group of more than one million people of western Senegal and The Gambia who speak a language also called Serer, an Atlantic branch of the Niger-Congo language family.
The Serer are a settled, agricultural people who grow millet, rice, and a wide variety of other crops, including tree crops. Cattle, sheep, and goats are tended, and trade, conducted in regular markets, is well-developed. Like the Wolof, the Serer are noted for playing the sabar, a traditional drum usually played in ensemble for virtually every occasion.
Contemporary Serer villages typically contain a cluster of small square or round huts of thatched reed or millet stalk. Compounds are not grouped in distinguishable hierarchies, and each compound is autonomous. In polygynous families, each wife has a separate hut. A bride-price, usually in livestock, is required. Inheritance and succession are matrilineal. Many Serer have remained animists, but conversion to Islam or Christianity was increasingly common at the turn of the 21st century.
