Rif, also spelled Riff, or Riffi,  any of the Berber peoples occupying a part of northeastern Morocco known as the Rif, an Arabic word meaning “edge of cultivated area.” The Rif are divided into 19 groups or social units: 5 in the west along the Mediterranean coast, 7 in the centre, 5 in the east, and 2 in the southeastern desert area. One central group is Arabic-speaking, as are sections of the five western groups. The others generally speak Rif, a regionally variable Berber language, but many also speak Spanish or Arabic. The Rif are Muslims.
The land of the Rif is a combination of mountains, rolling fields, and deserts, bordered by two rivers and 145 miles (233 km) of coastline. Their material culture is based on cultivation, herding, and sardine-seining.
Before their loss of independence in 1926 (see Rif War), the Rif were organized by kinship and residence into graded units. Each unit elected or appointed a council of men who were renowned fighters.
