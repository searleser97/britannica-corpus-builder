Mamprusi, also called Mampruli,  a people who inhabit the area between the White Volta and Nasia rivers in northern Ghana. The Mamprusi speak different dialects of More-Gurma (Mõõre-Gurma) of the Gur (Voltaic) branch of the Niger-Congo language family. A few Mamprusi also live in northern Togo.
Mamprusi settlements usually consist of a grouping of circular compounds that are surrounded by farmland. The countryside of this area of northern Ghana is orchard bush (tropical uplands with open woodland). A dry season from about October to March is followed by a rainy season from April to October. Agriculture is central to the Mamprusi economy, and the Mamprusi are hoe cultivators. Principal crops include millet, corn (maize), yams, okra, hibiscus, rice, and tobacco. Men clear the land and plant yams, while women sow and harvest the grain and transport crops from the fields. Hunting and fishing are secondary activities.
The Mamprusi differ from some other peoples of northern Ghana in their traditional organization as a centralized state with four subdivisions and a king. They, like all the peoples of northern Ghana, believe in a supreme being. The earth is viewed in both its practical aspect and spiritually, and the “earth cult” maintains shrines at sacred places. The importance of ancestors for the Mamprusi is manifested in shrines and rituals devoted to them. Many Mamprusi have now adopted Islam, but traditional religious practices persist. In the early 21st century Mamprusi speakers numbered about 220,000.
