Merina, also called Antimerina, Imerina, or Hova,  a Malagasy people primarily inhabiting the central plateau of Madagascar. They are the most populous ethnolinguistic group on the island.
The early Merina, whose origins are uncertain, entered the central plateau of Madagascar in the 15th century and soon established a small kingdom there. Early Merina rulers organized vast irrigation projects to drain the local marshes and make possible the practice of wet-rice cultivation in irrigated paddies. Under the early 16th-century queen Rafohy and her successors, the rule of the Merina people spread gradually through the central plateau. King Andrianampoinimerina (or Nampoina; ruled 1787–1810) was the first Merina monarch to consolidate his power and make Merina a unified kingdom. His armies, commanded by his son Radama, secured control over much of the central highlands.
Radama, as king from 1810 to 1828, continued his father’s policies and made tributaries of most of the kingdoms of Madagascar. He also instituted a policy of westernization and modernization, welcoming missionaries, European advisers, and Western education. This policy was reversed by his wife and successor, Queen Ranavalona I (reigned 1828–61), but it was revived under King Radama II (reigned 1861–63). The authority of the crown over the contentious Merina nobility was reinforced during the reigns of queens Rasoherina (reigned 1863–68) and Ranavalona II (reigned 1868–83) by the creation of a royal bureaucracy of European-style ministers. The Merina monarchs had nearly completed the unification of Madagascar into a single, centralized state when French troops occupied the capital in 1895 and turned the island into a colony.
The Merina cultivate rice, cassava, potatoes, onions, and other crops and raise cattle and pigs. They constitute a large proportion of the educated middle-class and intellectual elite of Madagascar, serving as businessmen, technicians, managers, and government officials.
