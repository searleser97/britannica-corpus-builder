Rwanda, also spelled Ruanda,  the peoples of the Republic of Rwanda who speak an Interlacustrine Bantu language known as Rwanda (also known as Kinyarwanda). The Rwanda are divided into two main groups: the Hutu, traditionally farmers; and the Tutsi, traditionally cattle-owning pastoralists. A small third group, the Pygmy Twa, are hunters and potters. The Rwanda language is mutually intelligible with Rundi, which is spoken in Burundi. Rwanda peoples live as refugees in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, and Uganda. More than 12 million people speak the Rwanda language.
