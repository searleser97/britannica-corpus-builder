Kenite,   member of a tribe of itinerant metalsmiths related to the Midianites and the Israelites who plied their trade while traveling in the region of the Arabah (the desert rift valley extending from the Sea of Galilee to the Gulf of Aqaba) from at least the 13th century to the 9th century bc. The Kenites’ name was derived from Cain, whose descendants they were believed to be. The Kenites are mentioned several times in the Old Testament.
The father-in-law of Moses, Jethro, was a Kenite, and as priest-leader of the tribe he led in the worship of Yahweh, whom Moses later revealed to the Hebrews as their own God whom they had forgotten. In the period of the judges (12th–11th century bc), it was a Kenite woman, Jael, who killed the general of Israel’s enemies, the Canaanites.
Settling among the Israelites, Amalekites, and Canaanites, the Kenites apparently became absorbed into the tribe of Judah. Conservative groups of Kenites retained their nomadic way of life and beliefs and practices, however, and one such group, the Rechabites (2 Kings), fought alongside the rebel and future king of Israel, Jehu (reigned c. 842–c. 815), against the Omri dynasty and the worshipers of the Canaanite god Baal.
