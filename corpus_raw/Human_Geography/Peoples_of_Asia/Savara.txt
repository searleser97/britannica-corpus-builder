Savara, also called Saora, Sora, or Saura,  tribe of eastern India. They are distributed mainly in the states of Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and BihƒÅr, with total numbers of about 310,000, most of whom are in Orissa.
Most Savara have become Hinduized and generally speak the Oriya language. Their traditional form of Munda dialect is preserved among those living in the hills, however. The Savara of the hill country are divided into subtribes mainly on the basis of occupation: the Jati Savara are cultivators; the Arsi, weavers of cloth; the Muli, workers in iron; the Kindal, basket makers; and the Kumbi, potters. The traditional social unit is the extended family, including both males and females descended from a common male ancestor.
