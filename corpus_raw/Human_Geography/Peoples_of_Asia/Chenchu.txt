Chenchu,  people of southern India, numbering about 59,000 at the turn of the 21st century. Most Chenchu live in the state of Andhra Pradesh. They speak variants of Telugu, the Dravidian language of the region. Their round houses of wattle and thatch are not unlike those used by other people of the region. Some of the Chenchu gain their food by hunting and by collecting the edible products of the jungle, particularly tubers; their tools are the bow and arrow, a metal-tipped digging stick, an ax, and a simple knife. These Chenchu are among the aboriginal peoples of India who are most removed from the dominant Hindu civilization. Their rituals are few and simple; religious and political specializations are slight. Small conjugal families predominate, women taking equal rank with men and marrying only upon maturity.
Most Chenchu, however, have been pressed by the expanding peasantry into agricultural and forest labour and out of their wandering, food-gathering life. Most have adopted Hindu gods and customs and have been accorded a relatively high caste status.
