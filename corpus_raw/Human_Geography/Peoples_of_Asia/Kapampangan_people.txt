Kapampangan, also called Pampango,  ethnolinguistic group living in the Philippines, principally in the central plain of Luzon, especially in the province of Pampanga, but also in parts of other adjoining provinces. Kapampangans numbered some two million in the early 21st century. 
The Kapampangan language is closely related to others of the central Philippines, all of which belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family of languages. The Kapampangan homeland, which extends north from Manila Bay, has a relatively high population density. Many Kapampangans are tenant farmers and landless workers. Artists of the group are mostly potters, jewelers, lantern makers, blacksmiths, and wood-carvers. Most Kapampangans are Christians, predominantly Roman Catholics. Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., and his wife, Corazon Aquino, who was president of the country (1986â€“92), were ethnic Kapampangans.
