Sasak, also spelled Sassak,  largest ethnic group on Lombok, one of the Lesser Sunda Islands in Indonesia. They constitute most of the island’s population and numbered about 2.6 million at the turn of the 21st century. The Sasak speak Sasak or Sasak-flavoured Balinese, both of which are Austronesian languages. Originally the only inhabitants of Lombok, the Sasak were under the political domination of Bali from the 18th century until 1895, when the Dutch conquered the island.
Concentrated most densely in the central third of the island, the Sasak are predominantly subsistence farmers of wet rice, coffee, vegetables, coconuts, bamboo, sugarcane, and pandanus. They may live in small villages of 5–20 families or in large villages with several thousand residents. Houses are built around a kampu (religious compound), where ceremonies take place.
Although they are adherents of Islam, the Sasak recognize caste social divisions and observe two forms of the religion: Wetu Telu (“Three Times”) and Wetu Lima (“Five Times”), so named for the number of times per day that practitioners pray, five times being the usual Muslim practice. Wetu Telu is essentially a local tradition with Islamic modifications; its followers typically live in smaller villages. Adherents of Wetu Lima, by contrast, usually reside in the larger settlements. Village officials, including a headman, are chosen from among both Muslim and traditional religious leaders. Islamization has strengthened the patrilineal structure of the Sasak, reinforcing male dominance in family structure, inheritance, and economic control.
