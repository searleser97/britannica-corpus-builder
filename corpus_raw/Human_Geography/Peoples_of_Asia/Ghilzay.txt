Ghilzay, also spelled Gilzai, Ghilzai, or Ghaljai,  one of the largest of the Pashto-speaking tribes in Afghanistan, whose traditional territory extended from Ghazni and Kalat-i-Ghilzai eastward into the Indus Valley. They are reputed to be descended at least in part from the Khalaj or Khilji Turks, who entered Afghanistan in the 10th century. The Lodi, who established a dynasty on the throne of Delhi in Hindustan (1450–1526), were a branch of the Ghilzay, and in the early 18th century Mir Vais Khan, a Ghilzay chieftain, captured Kandahar and established an independent kingdom there (1709–15). From this capital his son Mahmud conquered Persia.
Some of the Ghilzay had long been nomadic merchants, buying goods in India, where they wintered, and in summer transporting these by camel caravan for sale or barter in Afghanistan. In the late 19th century Afghan nomads began to enter the central mountains of Afghanistan, and several summer trading camps were established in the western mountains. Also, former stockbreeding nomads, who had always obtained grain and other necessities from villagers along their route, increased their trading activities. Some acquired land and, in summer, moved from one tenant-cultivated property to another. In eastern Afghanistan many Ghilzay have become settled cultivators.
