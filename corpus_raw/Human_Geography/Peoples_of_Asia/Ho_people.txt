Ho, also called Larka Kol,  tribal people of the state of Bihār in India, concentrated in the area of Kolhān on the lower Chota Nāgpur Plateau. They numbered about 1,150,000 in the late 20th century, mostly in Bihār and Orissa states of northeastern India. They speak a language of the Munda family and appear to have moved gradually into their territory from farther north. Their traditional social organization includes features common to those of other Munda-speaking tribes, including the institution of girls’ and boys’ dormitories, an elaborate system of village offices, and a territorial organization into quasi-military confederations. They trace their descent through the paternal line, and young people are expected to marry outside the paternal clan, but there is a prevalent custom of marrying one’s cousin on the maternal side. Marriage by elopement and by abduction are also traditionally common. The Ho worship spirits, some of which they believe to cause disease; they approach them through divination and witchcraft.
The traditional economy of the Ho was hunting and a primitive, shifting agriculture. These pursuits have declined in favour of settled agriculture and livestock raising. Many of the men also work as labourers in mines and factories.
