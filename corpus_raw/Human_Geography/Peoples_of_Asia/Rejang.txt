Rejang, also spelled Redjang,  tribe inhabiting Bengkulu province, southern Sumatra, Indonesia, on the upper course of the Musi River. Of Proto-Malay stock and numbering about 238,000 in the late 20th century, they speak a Malayo-Polynesian dialect called Rejang, whose written form is of Indian origin, predating Islāmization and its introduction of Arabic characters. Organized into four major patriclans having a common mythical origin, the Rejang belong to localized, kin-based communities. In addition, village communities, each led by an elected headman, today belong to regional committees, each with an elected chief recognized by the Indonesian administration. Rejang relationships are determined by alternating unilateral kinship, in which the form of marriage determines whether a child will belong to his mother’s or father’s clan. Patrilineal kinship is slightly more common; an illegitimate child belongs to neither parental clan. Marriage is clan exogamic; polygamy is no longer practiced.
The Rejang cultivate wet and dry rice, tobacco, and coffee. Some work in local gold and silver mines. Originally practicing animism, they have converted to Islām. Food and rice are still offered to venerated volcanos on certain occasions.
