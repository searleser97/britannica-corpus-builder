Buryat, also spelled Buriat,  northernmost of the major Mongol peoples, living south and east of Lake Baikal. By the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) their land was ceded by China to the Russian Empire.
The Buryat are related by language, history, habitat, and economic type to the Khalkha Mongols of Outer Mongolia, the Mongols of Inner Mongolia and Manchuria (the Northeast), and the Kalmyk (Oirat), who together form the principal Mongol peoples. The Buryat are among the smaller of these groups; they numbered some 550,000 in the early 21st century.
The origins of the Buryat are not clear. One theory is that they were formed as an ethnic unit from various elements that settled in their present territory during the 13th and 14th centuries. By tradition they are a nomadic pastoral people who herd cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and a few camels. In their traditional social organization they were separated into noble and common strata; they also kept a few slaves. They traced descent through the paternal line, living in patrilineal families grouped into kin villages, clans, and clan confederations. The more permanently organized confederations were ruled by princely dynasties. In their religious life the Buryat had an intricate combination of shamanic and Buddhist traits. The eastern Buryat, under the closer influence of the Khalkha Mongols, were more thoroughly Buddhist in their rite than were the western. During tsarist times some became Orthodox Christians.
After the Russian Revolution the Buryatâ€™s open-pasture pastoralism was replaced by collective-farm cattle breeding. Experimental farms for raising sables augmented hunting and trapping in the taiga region. Timbering is now a major industry, and the fishing industry has been developed. More than 440,000 Buryat live in Russia, many in Buryatia. About 46,000 live in Mongolia, and another approximately 70,000 live in China.
