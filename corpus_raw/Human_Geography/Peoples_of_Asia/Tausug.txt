Tausug, also spelled Tau Sug or Tausog, also called Joloano, Sulu, or Suluk,  one of the largest of the Muslim (sometimes called Moro) ethnic groups of the southwestern Philippines. They live primarily in the Sulu Archipelago, southwest of the island of Mindanao, mainly in the Jolo island cluster. There are, however, significant migrant (or immigrant) communities of Tausug in Malaysia and Indonesia, particularly on the northeastern coast of the island of Borneo. In the early 21st century the Tausug in the Philippines numbered roughly 900,000; in Malaysia they totalled about 200,000, and in Indonesia they amounted to nearly 20,000.
Land is traditionally owned by the clan and controlled by local leaders known as datus. The customs of marriage and the family follow Muslim tradition. Kinship solidarity is very strong among the Tausug, and married children often live near—or in the same household with—the parents of the husband. The language of the Tausug, like those of most Muslim groups of the Philippines, is closely related to the languages of the central Philippines, which belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) language family. Tausug economy is based largely on agriculture, with rice as the principal food crop, supplemented by cassava (manioc), yams, corn (maize), and various grains. Coconuts and hemp are important cash crops. Fishing, trading by sea, and various handicrafts, notably metallurgy, are also pursued.
