Murut,   least numerous of the indigenous ethnic groups of Indonesian Borneo, living mostly in the hilly southwestern uplands of northeastern Malaysia and speaking a distinctive Austronesian language also called Murut. Of Proto-Malay stock, their prehistoric ancestors migrated from Asia. The Murut were historically headhunters living in longhouse settlements on hilltops for defense; they were gradually displaced into the interior by immigrant settlers. The Murut Rebellion in 1915 was a protest against British colonial indifference. After the large influx of Japanese in 1921â€“31, the Murut lost many members to a form of malaria against which they had no resistance. They numbered about 34,300 in 1980. Practicing slash-and-burn agriculture, they cultivate dry rice, corn (maize), and sweet potatoes. The nuclear family is the main kin group. Many Murut have entered the labour market to raise the traditional dowry for their daughters. Their traditional religion includes some elements of totemism.
