Sundanese,  one of the three principal ethnic groups of the island of Java, Indonesia. The Sundanese, estimated to number about 32 million in the early 21st century, are a highland people of western Java, distinguished from the Javanese mainly by their language and their more demonstrative approach to Islam.
Historically, they were first recorded under the Indo-Javanese Brahmanical states (8th century ce) and subsequently accepted the Mahayana Buddhism adopted by the Shailendra kings. Muslim trade led to their acceptance of Islam in the 16th century, the people of Bantam being especially fervent. However, elements of Hinduism and local religions survive.
The Sundanese village is governed by a headman and a council of elders. The single-family houses are made of wood or bamboo, raised on piling. Rice culture and ironworking, as well as marriage, birth, and death ceremonies, conform closely to the Javanese pattern, though often mixed with elements of Hindu origin. The Sundanese language, like Javanese, has distinct status styles, or registers: kasar (informal), halus (deferential), and panengah (a middle style).
The opening of roads into the highlands, the emergence of the plantation economy, and the establishment of village schools are among the forces that have tended to diminish cultural differences between the Sundanese and other peoples of Java over the course of the regionâ€™s development. Moreover, the Sundanese have spread well beyond their traditional homeland. By the early 21st century, Sundanese communities were well established in many corners of the Indonesian archipelago, most notably in central Java and in the Lampung area of southern Sumatra.
