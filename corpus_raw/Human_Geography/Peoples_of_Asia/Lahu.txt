Lahu, also known as Muhso, Musso, or Mussuh,  peoples living in upland areas of Yunnan, China, eastern Myanmar (Burma), northern Thailand, northern Laos, and Vietnam who speak related dialects of Tibeto-Burman languages. Although there is no indigenous Lahu system of writing, three different romanized Lahu orthographies exist; two of these were developed by Christian missionaries and the other by Chinese linguists. Literacy in Lahu is primarily for religious purposes; educated individuals also know the national language of the country in which they live.
The Lahu have historically lived in relatively autonomous villages. From time to time, however, a Lahu leader would be able to attract a following from many villages for a temporary period of time. Since the mid-20th century, the Lahu have been increasingly integrated into the countries in which they reside, albeit often as a marginalized minority.
Most Lahu traditionally engaged in slash-and-burn agriculture. Like other traditional peoples, they have been increasingly compelled by external political and economic influences to adopt settled agriculture. Some Lahu have been involved in the production of opium, although they have never been as involved in this work as have such other upland groups in the region as the Hmong and the Mien. Many Lahu have combined religious practices adopted from neighbouring Tai-speaking peoples with their own form of animism.
From the late 20th century onward, a growing number of Lahu converted to Christianity. At the beginning of the 21st century, estimates of the Lahu population indicated approximately 450,000 individuals in China, 125,000 in Myanmar, 30,000 in Thailand, 9,000 in Laos, and 7,000 in Vietnam.
