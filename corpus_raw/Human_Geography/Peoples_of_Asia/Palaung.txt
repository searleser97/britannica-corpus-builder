Palaung, also called Ta-ang,  hill people of the Shan region and adjacent areas of eastern Myanmar (Burma), as well as southwestern Yunnan province of China. They numbered about 240,000 in the late 20th century and speak dialects of the Palaungic branch of Austro-Asiatic languages. The Palaungâ€™s language is quite distinct from the Tai speech of the Shan (see Tai), with whom they live closely intermingled. Their area has a long history as a centre of tea production.
Some Palaung groups are organized in patrilineal lineages similar to those of the Kachin, their neighbours to the north; elsewhere their organization is more like that of the Shan. Shan-type Buddhism coexists with various local cults based on ancestor worship. The Palaung language resembles that of the head-hunting Wa farther east, but there is otherwise no close cultural connection between the two groups.
