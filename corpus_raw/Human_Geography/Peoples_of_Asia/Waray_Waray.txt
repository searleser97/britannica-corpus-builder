Waray-Waray, also called Waray or Samaran or Samare√±o,  any member of a large ethnolinguistic group of the Philippines, living on Samar, eastern Leyte, and Biliran islands. Numbering roughly 4.2 million in the early 21st century, they speak a Visayan (Bisayan) language of the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family. Most Waray-Waray are farmers and live in small villages. Although the kinship system and family structure are almost identical to those of other Christian Filipino groups, the Waray-Waray are considered to have retained more of the beliefs and folklore of pre-Christian times.
