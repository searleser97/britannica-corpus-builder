Acehnese, also spelled Atjehnese, or Achinese,  one of the main ethnic groups on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. They were estimated to number roughly 4.2 million in the early 21st century. They speak a language of the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family.
The Acehnese were ruled by Indian princes prior to 500 ce, and in the 13th century they became the first people in the Southeast Asian archipelago to adopt Islam. After expelling the Portuguese in the 17th century, the sultanate of Aceh (Acheh; Atjeh) was dominant in northern Sumatra until 1904, when the sultanate was conquered by the Dutch. Although part of the Republic of Indonesia since 1949, the Acehnese have remained restive. Their territory is administered as a special autonomous district, within which a strong separatist movement has continued to operate in the 21st century.
Traditional Acehnese dwellings, which prevail in some areas, consist of a three-room structure of wood raised high above the ground on pilings. Descent is traced through both the maternal and paternal lines. The position of women is high, and a married couple typically goes to live with the brideâ€™s family. Women do not wear veils, although they do cover their hair. Their traditional dress consists of a skirt over trousers, a jacket and scarf, and many ornaments. Acehnese menswear includes a jacket or shoulder cloth and trousers of great width.
