Kabābīsh,  nomadic people of the desert scrub of northern Kordofan region, Sudan, numbering about 70,000. Of mixed origins, including some Arab ancestry, they have been described as a loose tribal confederation whose composition, since the time of the Turkish occupation in 1821, has undergone a number of changes.
During the 19th century the Kabābīsh not only carried trade goods between the Nile River and Darfur but also took imposts or levies from caravans traversing their country. During the revolt of the Mahdī in 1881, a part of the tribe joined the revolution, but a strong section, anxious at the loss of trade, sided with the old government.
The traditional Kabābīsh cultivate very little and depend on their camels, sheep, and goats. With the coming of the dry season, they congregate at well centres in Dar Kabābīsh, moving camels and sheep south to central Kordofan and Darfur to meet the early rains. During the rains they rejoin the households that have once again moved northwestward. In years of good rains, the livestock, particularly camels, travel deep into northern Darfur and Chad to feed on the gizzu plant. In modern times more and more Kabābīsh have come to work outside their own traditional communities.
