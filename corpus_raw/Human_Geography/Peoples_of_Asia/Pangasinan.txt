Pangasinan,   eighth largest cultural-linguistic group of the Philippines. Numbering about 1,540,000 in the late 20th century, the Pangasinan occupy the west-central area of the island of Luzon. They are predominantly Roman Catholic. There has been considerable intermarriage with the Ilocanos from northern Luzon, an adjacent cultural-linguistic group with whom they share many traditions. Their language belongs to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family of languages. The area inhabited by the Pangasinan is one of the richest agricultural regions of the Philippines. The chief crop is rice, much of which goes by rail to the Manila markets. Minor crops are corn (maize), coconuts, mangoes and other tropical fruits, sugarcane, and tobacco.
