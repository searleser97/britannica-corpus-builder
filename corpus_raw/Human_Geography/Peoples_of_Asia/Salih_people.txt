Ṣāliḥ,   in ancient Arabia, a Christian tribe that was prominent during the 5th century ad. Although the Ṣāliḥ originated in southern Arabia, they began moving northward about ad 400, finally settling in the area southeast of Damascus. According to tradition, the Ṣāliḥ were the first Arabs to found a kingdom in Syria.
The Ṣāliḥ kings, who were recognized by the Byzantine emperors, managed to control the area until the end of the 5th century, when a poll-tax dispute resulted in extended wars between the Ṣāliḥ and the Ghassānids, a tribe from western Arabia. Although the Ghassānids finally gained control and established themselves as rulers of the Syrian Arabs, the Ṣāliḥ remained in Syria at least until about 635.
