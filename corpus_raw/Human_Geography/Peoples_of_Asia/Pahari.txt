Pahāṛī, also called Parbate,  people who constitute about three-fifths the population of Nepal and a majority of the population of neighbouring Himalayan India (in Himachal Pradesh and northern Uttar Pradesh). They speak languages belonging to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European family. The people are historically ancient, having been mentioned by the authors Pliny and Herodotus and figuring in India’s epic poem, the Mahabharata. Their numbers were estimated to be about 20,000,000 in the early 21st century.
The great majority of the Pahāṛī are Hindus, but their caste structure is less orthodox and less complex than that of the plains to the south. Usually they are divided into the high “clean” or “twice-born” castes (Khasia, or Ka) and the low “unclean” or “polluting” castes (Dom). Most of the high-caste Pahāṛī are farmers. The Dom work in a variety of occupations and may be goldsmiths, leather workers, tailors, musicians, drummers, and sweepers.
The Pahāṛī have historically practiced a wide variety of marriage arrangements, including polyandry (several brothers sharing one or more wives), polygyny (several wives sharing a husband), group marriages (with an equal number of husbands and wives), and monogamy. Girls may be married before age 10, though they do not cohabit with their husbands until they are mature. There is a double standard of sexual behaviour for women, who must be faithful to their husbands while living with them; when a married woman goes home to visit her parents, however, she is permitted the liberties of an unmarried girl.
The Pahāṛī are an agricultural people, cultivating terraces on the hillsides. Their chief crops are potatoes and rice. Other crops include wheat, barley, onions, tomatoes, tobacco, and various vegetables. Sheep, goats, and cattle are kept. The spinning of wool is done by everyone, while weaving is carried on by members of a lower caste.
