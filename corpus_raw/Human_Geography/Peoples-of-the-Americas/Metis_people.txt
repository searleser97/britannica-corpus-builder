Métis,  indigenous nation of Canada that has combined Native American and European cultural practices since at least the 17th century. Their language, Michif, which is a French and Cree trade language, is also called French Cree or Métis. The first Métis were the children of indigenous women and European fur traders in the Red River area of what is now the province of Manitoba. They cultivated a distinctive way of life; their culture, particularly their clothing, artwork, music, and dance, can be characterized as colourful and unique.
In the 21st century, Michif was spoken by some 800 individuals in the United States (Turtle Mountain Reservation, North Dakota) and Canada (scattered locations). The word métis, which means “mixed” in French, can be used of any aboriginal (First Nation) person of mixed descent, but the Métis who are of mixed French and Cree descent are the only speakers of Michif. There are several varieties of Michif in Canada.
The Métis resisted the Canadian takeover of the Northwest in 1869. Fearing the oncoming wave of settlers from Ontario, the Métis established a provisional government under the leadership of Louis Riel (1844–85). In 1870 this government negotiated a union with Canada that resulted in the establishment of the province of Manitoba. In 2003 Canada recognized the Métis as an indigenous group with the same broad rights as other First Nations peoples.
In the early 21st century the estimated number of Métis was more than 290,000.
