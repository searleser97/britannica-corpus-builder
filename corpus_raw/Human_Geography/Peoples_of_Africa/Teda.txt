Teda, also called Toda, Todaga, Todga, Tuda, or Tudaga,  people of the eastern and central Sahara (Chad, Niger, and Libya). Their language, also called Teda (or Tedaga), is closely related to the Kanuri and Zaghawa languages, and it belongs to the Saharan group of the Nilo-Saharan language family. Teda has northern and southern groups; the term Teda is sometimes used for the northern grouping only, with Daza (Dasa) used especially in French literature as the term for the southern group.
The Teda live either as nomadic herdsmen or as farmers near oases. Dates are a staple crop, and a variety of grains, legumes, and roots also are cultivated. Cattle, goats, donkeys, camels, and sheep are kept, and caravan trade is an important factor in the economy. Sedentary Teda villagers typically live in palm-thatched, rectangular mud houses or cylindrical huts of mud or stone with conical thatch.
The Teda are Islamic in religion, and one group has a sultan. Real power typically rests with local herdsmen, who inherit their offices. Descent is reckoned in the father’s line. Marriage involves a payment, usually of livestock, from the groom’s family to the bride’s. Marriage between first cousins is forbidden. Polygyny is permitted but is only moderately common. The Teda were estimated to number about 50,000 at the turn of the 21st century.
