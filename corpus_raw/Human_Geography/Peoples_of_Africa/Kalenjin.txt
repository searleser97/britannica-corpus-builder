Kalenjin,  any member of the Kipsikis (Kipsigis), Nandi, Pokot, or other related peoples of west-central Kenya, northern Tanzania, and Uganda who speak Southern Nilotic languages of the Nilo-Saharan language family.
The Kalenjin peoples probably expanded into the Rift Valley about ad 1500. During the 18th century a Maasai expansion pushed them into the area between the Rift Valley and Lake Victoria, where they live today. They depend for their subsistence primarily on agriculture. The name Kalenjin, which means “I tell you,” was adopted in the 1940s.
