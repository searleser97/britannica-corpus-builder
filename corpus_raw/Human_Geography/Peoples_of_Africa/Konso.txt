Konso,  ethnolinguistic group located in the arid highlands of southwestern Ethiopia. Their sharply delimited traditional territory is surrounded by lands of Oromo peoples, to whom the Konso are culturally and linguistically related. They are a Cushitic people.
Unlike most Ethiopian peoples, the Konso live in large towns, each governed by an autonomous council of elders. The social status of all males, and of some females, is defined by a generation-grading system. Although a generation grade theoretically encompasses the men in an entire region, it does not actually function beyond each town’s borders and therefore does not prevent conflicts between towns. Kinship is reckoned in nine exogamous, patrilineal clans and in lineages that are headed by priests and through which property is inherited. Craftsmen form a distinct social class. Although polygyny is accepted, few men can afford more than one wife.
The economy of the Konso rests on an exceptionally intensive agriculture involving irrigation and terracing of mountain slopes. Corn (maize) and numerous varieties of sorghum are the staple crops, and cotton and coffee are cash crops. To protect the fields the Konso maintain their cattle in stalls and feed them by hand or supervise their grazing. They use both the milk and the meat of cattle and the meat of sheep and goats as food, and the animals’ dung is collected for fertilizer. Numerous other animals are taboo as food.
The Konso are notable for the erection of wagas, memorial statues to a dead man who has killed an enemy or an animal such as a lion or a leopard. These stylized wooden carvings are arranged in groups, representing the man, his wives, and his vanquished adversaries.
