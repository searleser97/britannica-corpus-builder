Imbangala, also spelled Mbangala,  a warrior group of central Angola that emerged in the late 16th century. In older sources, the Imbangala are sometimes referred to as Jaga, a generic name for several bands of freebooting mercenary soldiers in the 17th through 19th centuries. The Imbangala probably originated in the central highlands of present-day Angola and were characterized by their ruthlessness and cannibalism, suggesting a cult dedicated to rapine. They recruited their members by capturing young boys and were said to kill all children born in their camps. About 1617 the Portuguese colony of Angola employed the Imbangala as mercenaries, achieving great success in wars against the Ndongo kingdom and other neighbouring peoples. Subsequently many bands of Imbangala either were destroyed, joined with Ndongo or the Portuguese, or formed independent polities of their own in the central highlands—most notably, the Kasanje kingdom in the upper Cuango River valley. The Kasanje kingdom became Portugal’s principal ally on the Cuango River and was integrated into Angola in c. 1911. In the 20th century, “Imbangala” became the specific name used to describe the ethnicity of people living in the former Kasanje kingdom.
