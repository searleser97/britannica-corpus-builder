Tsimihety,   a Malagasy people living in mountainous north central Madagascar. The Tsimihety (“Those Who Never Cut Their Hair”) were originally sedentary mountain people living in extended families organized through patrilineal descent. They succeeded in remaining independent of the early Sakalava and Betsimisarake kingdoms but submitted to Merina rule in the 1820s and to French rule at the turn of the 20th century.
Tsimihety speak a dialect of Malagasy, the Austronesian West Indonesian language common to all Malagasy peoples. The Tsimihety have traditionally never been politically unified but are now one of the most mobile and dynamic peoples of Madagascar. A high birth rate and strict rules for exogamous marriage obliged them to penetrate neighbouring areas in search of pastures for their cattle and land on which to grow their staple food, rice. The main area for Tsimihety expansion was toward the west, among the lands of the Sakalava people. Many Tsimihety sons also work as seasonal wage labourers on coffee or tobacco plantations throughout northern Madagascar.
