Malagasy peoples,  complex of about 20 ethnic groups in Madagascar. The largest group is the Merina, who primarily inhabit the central plateau. The second-largest group is the Betsimisaraka, who live generally in the east. The third is the Betsileo, who inhabit the plateau around Fianarantsoa. Others include the Tsimihety, the Sakalava, the Antandroy, the Tanala, the Antaimoro, and the Bara. All Malagasy peoples speak a dialect of Malagasy, an Austronesian language. The written language is a standardized version of the Merina dialect. Most Malagasy peoples live in rural areas and grow rice, cassava (manioc), and other crops. About half are Christian, while some two-fifths practice their traditional religion based on ancestor worship. A Sunni Muslim community is found in the northwest region of the country.
