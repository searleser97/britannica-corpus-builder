Makonde, also spelled Maconde,  Bantu-speaking people living in northeastern Mozambique and southeastern Tanzania.
Their economy rests primarily on swidden (slash-and-burn) agriculture, supplemented by hunting; corn (maize), sorghum, and cassava are the major crops. Many Makonde have migrated to other parts of the East African coast in search of employment. They are renowned for their wood carving.
The Makonde reckon descent matrilineally. Polygyny is common. Primary marriage always entails a bride-price.
Each settlement has a hereditary headman and an advisory council of elders. The Makonde lack a more embracing political structure, each settlement being independent. Though they have been under heavy Muslim influence for a very long time, few have converted to Islam.
