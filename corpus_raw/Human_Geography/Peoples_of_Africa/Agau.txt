Agau, also spelled Agaw and Agew,  an ancient people who settled in the northern and central Ethiopian Plateau and are associated with the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in the area. The term Agau also refers to any of several contemporaneous groups that are either culturally similar or linked by a Cushitic language base. The Jewish Beta Israel (or “Ethiopian Jews”) are believed to have descended from the Agau, and they retain some of the old Agau words in their religious vocabulary. Agau dialects are spoken in the mountainous region of Simen northeast of the city of Gonder and in the area southeast of Gonder. Awiya, a dialect spoken south of Lake Tana, is believed to contain the strongest similarities of any of the dialects to the ancient Agau language. Amharic also has many Agau elements and influences.
