Anywa, also called Anuak, also spelled Anywak,  a Luo-speaking riverine people, two-thirds of whom live in eastern South Sudan and the remainder in Ethiopia. The Anywa are believed to have migrated from lands east of the African Great Lakes several centuries ago. They number about 100,000, and their language is classified as Nilo-Saharan.
The Sudanese Anywa occupy high ground in savanna grasslands along riverbanks that are flooded annually; separate wet- and dry-season villages are maintained. The Ethiopian Anywa live in forested savannas and along streams in the highlands bordering South Sudan. Because more dry ground is available to the eastern (Ethiopian) Anywa—resulting in more closely connected villages—they have a wider political organization than that afforded by the autonomous villages of the western Anywa. Unlike most Nilotic peoples, the eastern Anywa keep no cattle; instead they fish, hunt, maintain gardens, and raise sheep and goats.
Anywa clans are patrilineal. Lineage members live in the same village, but each village, of 200 to 2,000 people, comprises several unrelated clans. Eastern Anywa traditionally have had a royal clan and a king, while western village headmen have had autonomy. Most Anywa are monogamous.
