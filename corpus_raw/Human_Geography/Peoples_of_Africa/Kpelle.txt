Kpelle, also called Guerze,  people occupying much of central Liberia and extending into Guinea, where they are sometimes called the Guerze; they speak a language of the Mande branch of the Niger-Congo family.
The Kpelle are primarily farmers. Rice is their staple crop and is supplemented by cassava, vegetables, and fruits; cash crops include rice, peanuts (groundnuts), sugarcane, and kola nuts. The Kpelle practice slash-and-burn agriculture. The typical household consists of a man, his several wives, and their children; they live either in rectangular wattle-and-daub huts with thatched roofs or in the more traditional round huts with conical thatched roofs. The household is the usual farming unit, but some farm work is also performed by a voluntary cooperative work group.
The Kpelle are organized under several paramount chiefs, who, as government officials, serve as mediators between the people and the modern government, as well as performing their traditional duties of settling disputes, preserving order, and maintaining roads. A chiefdom is divided into districts; the head of each district serves as a liaison between the paramount chief and his people. Each town also has its own chief.
The poro and the sande are, respectively, male and female secret societies that meet in sacred groves in the forest. The poro, the more important of the organizations, is personified by the Great Masked Figure, or Grand Master, a person who only appears in public disguised by a mask, costume, and falsetto voice. He represents both the political power of important landowners and the ritual power of supernatural authorities. The poro functions to enforce social norms through its court, to socialize young people through its initiation schools, and to provide bonds that unite members from different kinship and territorial units.
