Gusii, also called Kisii or Kosova,  a Bantu-speaking people who inhabit hills of western Kenya in an area between Lake Victoria and the Tanzanian border. The Gusii probably came to their present highlands from the Mount Elgon region some 500 years ago. The Gusii economy comprises a multiplicity of productive activities: they farm pyrethrum and tea as cash crops, as well as millet, corn (maize), cassava, sorghum, yams, peanuts (groundnuts), and bananas; and they keep cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, and bees. In addition, Gusii men hunt, herd, milk, and fish, while women make butter and do most of the agricultural work.
Their region is one of the most densely populated areas of Kenya, and the Gusii constitute one of the largest ethnic groups in Kenya. The patrilineal Gusii live in neighbourhoods of dispersed family homesteads. Their neighbours are the Nilotic Luo and Kipsikis. They are now represented by chiefs in the local Kenyan administration. Polygyny is practiced to a limited extent. The old custom of paying bridewealth in livestock has been changing with the development of a modern money economy.
