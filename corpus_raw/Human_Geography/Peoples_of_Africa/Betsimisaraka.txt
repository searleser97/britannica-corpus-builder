Betsimisaraka,   a Malagasy people living along the east-central and northeastern coast of Madagascar. The Betsimisaraka speak a dialect of Malagasy, the West Austronesian language that is common to all Malagasy peoples. The Betsimisaraka (“Inseparable Multitude”) live along the narrow eastern coastal strip; away from the coast their land rises into dense montane forest. They raise rice, cassava, and corn (maize) by burning off the natural vegetation and planting in the ash-enriched soil. Many Betsimisaraka have turned to growing coffee, vanilla, cloves, and other export crops on their small farms.
The Betsimisaraka kingdom was founded in the early 18th century by Ratsimilaho. He united the various chiefdoms along a 400-mile (650-kilometre) stretch of the coast and gave the Betsimisaraka their name, but the kingdom collapsed on the death of the dynasty’s third ruler in 1791. Most of the Betsimisaraka then fell under the rule of the expanding Merina kingdom to the west until the advent of French colonial rule in the 1890s.
The Betsimisaraka have been historically known as sailors and pirates. In the past, using large canoes that could seat 50 or more, they sailed in fleets of several thousand men and pillaged the Comoro Islands (modern Comoros) northwest of Madagascar. Comoro Islanders were brought back and incorporated into Betsimisaraka society; several clans now trace their ancestry to these captives. The Betsimisaraka were also ardent fishermen and whalers and served as sailors on European vessels from an early date.
