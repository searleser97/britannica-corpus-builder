Lala,  a people of eastern Nigeria. The Lala belong to a small cluster of linguistically related peoples in geographic proximity, the Ga-Anda, Yungur, Handa, and Mboi living north of the Benue River.
The Lala and other small indigenous groups of the mountainous Nigeria-Cameroon borderlands have had somewhat complicated relations with migrant peoples, particularly Hausa peddlers and Fulani pastoralists. For some time the Lala defended themselves from Fulani raids by means of a habitat characterized by hills, plateaus, and fields hedged with milkbush. At other times, Fulani herdsmen paid fees to the Lala for cattle-grazing rights. The Ga-Anda have even employed Fulani to tend the larger herds, paying the herdsmen with milk. By the 20th century, however, the Lala were politically subordinate to the Yola emirate of the Muslim Fulani.
Crops such as cassava, corn (maize), and millet are cultivated by Lala women, and goats, sheep, and chickens are raised. The smelting of iron ore from local riverbeds died out during British colonial administration.
