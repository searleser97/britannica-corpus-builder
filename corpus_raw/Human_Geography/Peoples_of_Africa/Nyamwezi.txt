Nyamwezi, also called Banyamwesi,  Bantu-speaking inhabitants of a wide area of the western region of Tanzania. Their language and culture are closely related to those of the Sukuma (q.v.). 
The Nyamwezi subsist primarily by cereal agriculture, their major crops being sorghum, millet, and corn (maize). Rice is a significant cash crop. The Nyamwezi have long been famous as travellers and workers outside their own country; as porters they became known throughout East Africa.
Though they once lived in compact villages, the Nyamwezi have dispersed since the 19th century, living now in relatively scattered homesteads. Marriage entails both a bride-price and bride service; polygyny is permitted but limited in practice. Descent is through the female line. The Nyamwezi have a number of secret societies that require initiation and other ceremonies.
Chiefdoms were formerly highly developed. Each had a hierarchy of territorial officers culminating in that of the ntemi (“chief”). There was a large aristocracy and an even larger slave population.
Ancestor worship is the most important facet of religious activity. High gods and spirits are also recognized. A mfumi (“diviner”) can interpret a situation for an individual or a group, telling them what forces are impinging on their lives. Christianity and Islām have made only limited inroads.
