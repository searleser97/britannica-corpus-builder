Zaramo, also spelled Dzalamo, or Saramo,  a people who reside in the area surrounding Dar es-Salaam, Tanzania, and comprise the major ethnic component in the city. The Zaramo are considered to be part of the cluster of Swahili peoples on the coast of East Africa who have incorporated elements from many diverse ethnic backgrounds but who are unified in the Islāmic faith and in the use of the Swahili language.
Swahili–Arab cultural contributions appear in dress and other practices, but longer standing traditions are maintained in such areas as kinship. The Zaramo are organized into 200 to 300 matrilineal clans. Traditional religious beliefs such as the kolelo fertility cult and the worship of the deity Mulungu have been abandoned to some extent. The Zaramo are not politically centralized traditionally, but they often live in clusters of palisaded villages (pangone) led by a headman (phazi).
Although they keep some livestock the rural Zaramo concentrate mainly on agriculture, producing rice, millet, sorghum, corn (maize), peas, cassava, coconuts, and a number of other crops. The proximity of the sea permits fishing by a variety of techniques. In former times the Zaramo fashioned iron implements and even copied European firearms. More recently, Zaramo skill at woodcarving has been displayed in ornamental doors, musical instruments, and other functional creations, as well as in wares prepared for tourists.
The Zaramo, according to traditional explanations, originated as the Kutu in what is today the Morogoro administrative region of Tanzania. Their coastal location close to Dar es-Salaam has exposed them to many contacts, especially to trading groups. By means of an arrangement called utani, the Zaramo and neighbouring groups are permitted to travel through neighbouring territories; individuals can also claim emergency assistance from their neighbours.
