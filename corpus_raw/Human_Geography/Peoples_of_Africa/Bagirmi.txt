Bagirmi,  people living on the southern fringe of the Sahara, close to the region of Bornu in Chad and Nigeria. They numbered about 70,000 at the turn of the 21st century. Most speak Bagirmi, a Central Sudanic language of the Nilo-Saharan language family. They are not to be confused with a smaller group of Bagirmi who speak dialects of Fula, the language of the Fulani people, which belongs to the Atlantic branch of the Niger-Congo family.
In the old kingdom of Bagirmi, the Bagirmi exercised political dominance over many other peoples, and waves of invading peoples kept the Bagirmi almost constantly beleaguered.
When King Idris Alawma of Bornu conquered the Bagirmi about 1600, Islam was introduced; it made scant headway, however, and most people retained their traditional beliefs.
The Bagirmi practice hoe cultivation, growing chiefly millet and sorghum. They also keep cattle, goats, sheep, dogs, and chickens. They make use of milk, butter, and cheese, as do most pastoralists, and the practices of irrigation and fertilization with manure are common in certain areas.
The complex social stratification of the Bagirmi includes a privileged nobility headed by a royal family.
