Kaska,  an Athabaskan-speaking group of First Nations (Indian) peoples living in the forested mountains between the two great ranges, the Coast Mountains and the Rocky Mountains, in northeastern British Columbia and southeastern Yukon. The nomadic Kaska were primarily caribou hunters and lived in temporary dwellingsâ€”tepees or huts made of poles and brush or, sometimes in summer, simple lean-tos. Transport was by canoe, snowshoe, and toboggan. Although not much is known of their religious beliefs (or of their customs), apparently they, like the Sekani farther south, believed in animal spirits and in the practices of medicine men. Their language is mutually intelligible with that of the Tahltan and Tagish.
The Kaska continued to inhabit their traditional lands, and in the early 21st century the Kaska in British Columbia were negotiating a treaty settlement. Although they considered themselves one nation, the Kaska were divided by the Indian Act into five bands, now considered First Nations. The B.C. groups were the Dease River First Nation at Good Hope Lake; Daylu Dena Council at Lower Post; and the Kwadacha First Nation at Fort Ware, north of Prince George. The Yukon groups were the Liard First Nation at Watson Lake and the Ross River Dena Council at Ross River. Early 21st-century population estimates indicated some 2,200 Kaska descendants.
