Hare, also called Kawchottine,  group of Athabaskan-speaking North American Indians originally living northwest of what is now Great Bear Lake in far northwestern Canada. Their name for themselves, Kawchottine, means “People of Great Hares”; it was used because Arctic hares were an important source of food in traditional culture, supplementing the group’s main diet of fish. The hare was also the tribe’s main source of skins for clothing, although caribou fur was preferred when available. The Hare were noted for a certain shyness and reclusiveness from neighbouring Eskimo (Inuit) and other tribes. The Hare were scattered in many independent bands; culturally, they resembled the Slave tribe and other American Subarctic peoples.
Early 21st-century population estimates indicated some 1,000 Hare descendants.
