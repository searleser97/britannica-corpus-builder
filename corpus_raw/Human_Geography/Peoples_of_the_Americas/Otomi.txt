Otomí,   Middle American Indian population living in the central plateau region of Mexico. The Otomí peoples speak at least four closely related languages, all called Otomí. A rather large number of modern Otomí no longer speak the Otomí language but continue to consider themselves Otomí. All the Otomí peoples are culturally similar.
Their subsistence is based on farming and livestock raising; staple crops are corn (maize), beans, and squash. Fields are cleared by slash-and-burn methods, and planting is done with a coa, a sort of combination hoe and digging stick. The less conservative Otomí also plant cash crops such as wheat and barley, which are cultivated using plow and oxen. The maguey (Mexican century plant) is also cultivated for a variety of uses. Sheep, goats, chickens, turkeys, and hogs are the most commonly raised livestock. Settlements vary in composition from the concentrated central village with surrounding farmlands to the dispersed type in which each family lives on its land and only public buildings are congregated. Crafts include spinning, weaving, pottery, basketry, and rope making. Dress varies from completely traditional to completely modern. Common dress in conservative areas consists of white cotton shirt and pants, serape, sandals, and hat for men and long tubular skirt, embroidered cotton blouse, and rebozo or cape (quechquemitl) for women.
Ritual kinship institutions, based on a godparent relationship between the adults of one family and a child of another, is a central and essentially universal custom. Close ties exist between the parents and godparents of a child, and a series of ritual obligations obtain between them. The Otomí are Roman Catholic, and, although certain identifications between Christian figures and pre-Christian gods exist, the major religious rituals, myths, and ceremonies are basically Christian.
