Tojolabal,   Mayan Indians of Chiapas in southeastern Mexico, near the Guatemalan border. The Tojolabal language is closely related to that of the Tzotzil and Tzeltal, their neighbours to the northwest, and to that of the Chuj, to the southeast in Guatemala; and there are many cultural similarities between the groups. The territory inhabited by the Tojolabal is one of large highland plains separated by low hills.
The people are agriculturists, raising the Middle American staples—corn (maize), beans, and squash—in family plots. Coffee and sugarcane are grown as cash crops in some areas. Settlements consist of farm households dispersed around central villages; most permanent inhabitants of such villages are Europeanized or modernized Indians or persons of mixed ancestry.
Tojolabal houses are characteristically of wattle-and-daub construction, with thatched roofs. Crafts that are still seen are the weaving of woolen blankets and some pottery making. The Tojolabal are Roman Catholic, with an orientation toward the veneration of saints. Caves, springs, and hills are also worshiped, however, and crop-fertility rituals are performed. The institution of ritual kinship (compadrazgo) is complex and of great importance; godparents are selected at several important points in a child’s life.
