Diaguita,   Indian peoples of South America, formerly inhabiting northwestern Argentina and the Chilean provinces of Atacama and Coquimbo. The Calchaquí, a northwestern Argentine subgroup of the Diaguita, are the best-documented. Their language affiliation remains uncertain.
The Calchaquí were described as warlike, and their stone fortifications located at strategic places in their territory attest to this. They became effective cavalrymen who carried the attack to Spanish towns. They farmed terraced fields, sometimes built irrigation canals, and also kept herds of llama. Their technological skill extended to the loom weaving of llama-wool textiles, which they dyed; basket making; and a rather elaborate ceramic industry. Metallurgy was also known. Religious beliefs involved shamanistic practices for the cure of illness felt to be caused by witchcraft.
