K’iche’, formerly spelled Quiché, also called K’iche’ Maya,  Mayan people living in the midwestern highlands of Guatemala. The K’iche’ had an advanced civilization in pre-Columbian times, with a high level of political and social organization. Archaeological remains show large population centres and a complex class structure. Written records of K’iche’ history and mythology are preserved in the Popol Vuh and in a number of other colonial documents and chronicles, written down in the K’iche’ language shortly after conquest by the Spaniards in 1524.
The modern K’iche’ number some one million speakers, and the K’iche’ language is one of the largest Mayan linguistic groups, though no sense of ethnic unity derives from their common language, which is closely related to that of the neighbouring Tz’utujil and Kaqchikel. Indeed, the K’iche’ culture is essentially the same as that of the Tz’utujil and Kaqchikel, as well as of other peoples to the north. The K’iche’ and their neighbours are agriculturalists, practicing the hand-tilled farming of corn (maize), beans, and squash that is characteristic in Middle America. They also plant cash crops such as strawberries and peaches. Homes generally are maintained by each family on its own land. Weaving and pottery are widely practiced crafts, and clothing is often traditional.
The people identify themselves with their community (municipio), oriented around a central village, which in this region often has no permanent inhabitants. Village officials are elected annually. Nominally Roman Catholic, the K’iche’ are organized into village cofradías, religious societies that maintain the church and organize fiestas for the local patron saints. Indigenous beliefs, however, are widespread, and non-Christian rituals are widely practiced. The saints, the Virgin Mary, and the Devil are often identified with Mayan divinities.
