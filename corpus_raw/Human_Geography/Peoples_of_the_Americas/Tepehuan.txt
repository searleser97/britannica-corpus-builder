Tepehuan,   Middle American Indians of southern Chihuahua, southern Durango, and northwestern Jalisco states in northwestern Mexico. The Tepehuan are divided into the Northern Tepehuan, of Chihuahua, and the Southern Tepehuan, of Durango. Both speak dialects of the same language, Tepehuan, a Uto-Aztecan language that is most closely related to Piman.
The habitat of both the Northern and the Southern Tepehuan is rugged and mountainous. The people are agricultural, growing corn (maize) and beans in small plots. The Northern Tepehuan keep a few chickens, turkeys, and goats and add to their diet a good deal of wild food. The Southern Tepehuan herd goats and eat a considerable amount of goat cheese and, occasionally, goat meat. Settlements are usually scattered, towns and villages being little more than governmental centres or mestizo population centres. Houses are stone or adobe for the Southern Tepehuan, log or plank among the Northern Tepehuan. Northern Tepehuan women weave blankets; otherwise, no traditional crafts are practiced. Clothing consists of white cotton jacket and pants for the men who do not wear commercially made clothing; women wear homemade but nontraditional printed cotton dresses or skirts and blouses.
Religion among both the Northern and Southern Tepehuan is a mixture of folk Roman Catholicism and native elements. Official Roman Catholic sacraments occur to some extent, particularly among the Southern Tepehuan; in the north not even these are important. God, Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and the saints are mixed in native pantheons in both regions, alongside such figures as the Deer God, mountain spirits, the Morning Star, and a culture hero resembling Quetzalc√≥atl of Aztec myth.
