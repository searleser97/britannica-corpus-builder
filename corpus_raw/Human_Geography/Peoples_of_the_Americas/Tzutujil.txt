Tz’utujil, also spelled Tzutujil,  Mayan Indians of the midwestern highlands of Guatemala. The Tz’utujil language is closely related to those of the neighbouring Kaqchikel and K’iche’. The Tz’utujil, like neighbouring Mayan peoples, are agricultural, growing the Indian staple crops—corn (maize), beans, and squash. They also keep a few domestic animals such as sheep, pigs, and chickens. The people live in municipios, districts or communities oriented around a central village; the central villages in this region are not usually permanently inhabited. The Indians consider themselves members of the municipio rather than Tz’utujil or Guatemalan. The basic cultural pattern is very similar to that of the K’iche’or the Kaqchikel; custom and dress vary to some extent from one municipio to the next.
