Purí and Coroado,   two South American Indian tribes closely related in language and culture. According to a Coroado tradition, a feud between two families had caused the aboriginal tribe to divide in two. They lived in the lowlands of Mato Grosso state, Brazil. The Purí language is a dialect of Coroado, of the Macro-Ge linguistic group.
Before contact with white settlers at the end of the 18th century, both tribes were hunters and gatherers in the forests and mountains of eastern Brazil near the coast, without agriculture or domesticated animals. They hunted in bands of one or two extended families numbering about 40 people led by an elder. Under colonial pressures they declined greatly in number; of the Coroado, perhaps fewer than 1,000 remained in the late 20th century.
The Purí and Coroado had shamans who interceded with the spirits to cure sickness and to foretell future events. The shamans used tobacco to induce their trances.
