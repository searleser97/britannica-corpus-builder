Mohican, also spelled Mahican, self-name Muh-he-con-neok,  Algonquian-speaking North American Indian tribe of what is now the upper Hudson River valley above the Catskill Mountains in New York state, U.S. Their name for themselves means “the people of the waters that are never still.” During the colonial period, they were known to the Dutch and the English as the River Indians and to the French as the Loups (“Wolves”). The Mohican are not to be confused with the Mohegan, who originally resided in what is now Connecticut and are related to the Pequot.
Before colonization, the Mohican consisted of at least five bands and were further organized by three matrilineal clans; the latter were governed by hereditary sachems, or chiefs, who were assisted by elected counselors. Tribal members lived in strongholds of 20 to 30 houses, situated on hills and enclosed by stockades, as well as in enclosed villages situated between cornfields and woodland.
When first contacted by the Dutch, the Mohican were at war with the Mohawk, and in 1664 they were forced to move from Schodack, near Albany, to what is now Stockbridge, Mass. They gradually sold their territory there, and in 1736 some of them were gathered into a mission at Stockbridge and became known as the Stockbridge band; other groups scattered and merged with other tribes. The Stockbridge band later moved to Wisconsin and were joined by the Munsee band; the two groups were allotted a joint reservation in Wisconsin in the 19th century. The American novelist James Fenimore Cooper drew a romanticized portrait of the Mohican in his book The Last of the Mohicans (1826).
Population estimates indicated approximately 3,500 Mohican descendants in the early 21st century.
