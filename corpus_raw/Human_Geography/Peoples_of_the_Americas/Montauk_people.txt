Montauk,  both a single tribe and a confederacy of Algonquian-speaking North American Indian tribes who lived on the eastern and central parts of what is now Long Island, N.Y.; the confederacy included the Shinnecock, Manhasset, Massapequa, Montauk proper, Patchogue, and Rockaway tribes. Like other Algonquian tribes of this area, the Montauk proper depended for their subsistence largely on women’s cultivation of corn (maize), which was supplemented by men’s hunting and community-wide fishing. They were semisedentary, moving seasonally between fixed sites as food resources required.
The Montauk proper were dominated by the Pequot until the destruction of that tribe in 1637, after which the Narragansett attacked the tribe and its allies. Disease further reduced the Montauk population, and in about 1659 the estimated 500 remaining members of the tribe sought refuge with English colonists at Easthampton. By 1788 only some 162 Montauk tribal members remained.
Population estimates indicated some 700 Montauk descendants in the early 21st century.
