Pamlico,   Algonquian-speaking Indians who lived along the Pamlico River in what is now Beaufort county, N.C., U.S., when first encountered by Europeans. These sedentary agriculturists were almost destroyed by smallpox in 1696, and in 1710 the 75 survivors lived in a single village. They joined with part of the Tuscarora and other tribes in a war against white settlers (1711â€“13); at the close of the war those Tuscarora under treaty with the English agreed to exterminate the Pamlico. The surviving remnant were probably incorporated as slaves to the Tuscarora.
