Jicaque,   Indians of the northwest coast of Honduras. Their culture is similar to that of the Sumo and Miskito of northeastern Nicaragua. The Jicaque are an agricultural people, growing sweet manioc (yuca), bitter manioc, beans, and corn (maize) as staples. Fishing and hunting provide other food; domesticated animals are now common. Their houses are built of poles and thatch. Clothing is semitraditional; commercial cloth and shirts, trousers, and dresses are becoming common. Crafts include weaving, basketry, the making of metates (for grinding corn), and the manufacture of bows and arrows. The Jicaque practice polygyny. Their religion centres around two benevolent male deities and an evil female deity; offerings are made only to the evil goddess, in order to avoid ill fortune.
