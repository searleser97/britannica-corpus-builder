Shipibo, also spelled Xipibo,  Panoan-speaking Indian group living on the upper Ucayali River near the headwaters of the Amazon, on the eastern slopes of the Peruvian high Andes Mountains.
In the pre-Spanish period, the Shipibo were only minimally influenced by the Inca empire, despite the proximity of the Shipibo to the great Inca cities. When Spanish missionaries, soldiers, and explorers first contacted the Shipibo in the mid-16th century, they met with hostile and often deadly resistance. Between the mid-17th and early 18th century, Spanish missionaries exerted powerful influences on the Shipibo. In the 20th century the Shipibo, numbering about 10,000, lived in remote villages in the mountains of Peru.
