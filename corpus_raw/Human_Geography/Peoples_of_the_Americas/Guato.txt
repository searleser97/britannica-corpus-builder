Guat贸,  Indians of the lowlands and marshes of the upper Paraguay River (along the modern-day border between Brazil and Bolivia). Traditionally, the Guat贸 were riverine nomads who spent much of their lives in dugout canoes. Subsistence was based on fishing, hunting aquatic mammals, and collecting wild foods (especially, in the flood season, wild rice); they also practiced some cultivation. The nuclear family was an independent social and economic unit. The Guat贸 were divided into three local subtribes, each under a headman, which occasionally met together in council. In the early 21st century, ecotours visited the Guat贸 communities.
