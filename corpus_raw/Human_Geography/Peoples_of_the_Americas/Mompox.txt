Mompox, also called Malibú,  Indian people of what are now the northern Colombia lowlands who became extinct under Spanish rule. Culturally the Mompox were similar to their neighbours, such as the Cenú (q.v.); all such groups spoke languages of the Cariban family, but the Mompox language was not closely related to the languages of its neighbours.
