Shoshone-Bannock,  any of the bands formerly of the Shoshone and Bannock peoples of North America who later chose to live as one people. Some of these bands shared the Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho after its creation in 1863. In 1937 certain of these bands chose to incorporate jointly under federal charter and became officially recognized as Shoshone-Bannock. Other bands continued to be recognized as either Shoshone or Bannock.
In the early 21st century, population estimates indicated some 5,000 individuals of Shoshone-Bannock descent.
