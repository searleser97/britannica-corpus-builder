Tairona,   Indians of the northern Colombian Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, known only from occasional references in Spanish colonial writings and from archaeological study. The Tairona used stone to build houses, tombs, bridges, and terraced platforms. Their crafts are represented by ceramic ware; stone utensils such as metates (for grinding corn [maize]); bone and shell ornaments; and beads, buttons, and jewelry made of gold, copper, and gold-copper alloy (tumbaga). It is known that the Tairona were agriculturists because tools such as metates and hoes have been found; and, from the well-made stone buildings and artifacts of worked metals, it can be supposed that their culture was similar to those of the Chibcha or the Inca, although the Tairona were apparently unrelated to them.
