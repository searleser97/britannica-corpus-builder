Tonkawa,  North American Indian tribe of what is now south-central Texas. Their language is considered by some to belong to the Coahuiltecan family and by others to be a distinct linguistic stock in the Macro-Algonquian phylum. Satellite groups of the Tonkawa included the Ervipiame, Mayeye, and Yojuane.
Before colonization, the Tonkawa were nomadic bison hunters; their mobile villages of tepees were dispersed across the southern Plains landscape. They were notable warriors, whose offensive weapons included bows, arrows, and spears. In battle they wore leather jackets and caps decorated with horns and brilliant plumage. At one time or another the Tonkawa fought most of their neighbours, from the Apache to the Caddo.
After 1770, when their relations with the Spanish became friendly, the Tonkawa obtained firearms in exchange for tallow, deerskins, and buffalo robes. For a time they also had friendly relations with the Texans. In 1858 they were employed as scouts against the Comanche and Wichita. In 1859 the Tonkawa were removed from the Brazos River reservation to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The Tonkawa population of perhaps 1,500 at the time of their first European contact (1691) decreased as a result of warfare and disease; Tonkawa descendants numbered more than 300 in the early 21st century.
