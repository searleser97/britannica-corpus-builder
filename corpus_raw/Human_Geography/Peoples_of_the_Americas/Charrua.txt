Charrúa,  South American Indians who inhabited the grasslands north of the Río de la Plata in a territory somewhat larger than modern Uruguay. Little is known of their language. Linguistically related groups, including the Yaró, Guenoa, Bohané, and Minuan, have also been subsumed in the generic name Charrúa.
The Charrúa were hunters and gatherers, and after the introduction of the horse they lived by catching wild cattle. They were fierce in war, using the skulls of their fallen foes as ceremonial drinking cups. They were good bowmen and also used bolas, slings, and spears. In their social and economic patterns they resembled other Patagonian and Pampean nomads. On the death of a close relative they would lacerate themselves and cut off finger joints.
Since the colonial settlement of the grasslands, the Charrúa have ceased to exist as an independent society.
