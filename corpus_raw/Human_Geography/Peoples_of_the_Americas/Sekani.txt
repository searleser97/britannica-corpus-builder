Sekani, also spelled Tsek’ehne,  Athabaskan-speaking North American Indian group that lived mostly in river valleys on the eastern and western slopes of the Rocky Mountains in what are now British Columbia and Alberta, Can. They were often harassed by the neighbouring Cree, Beaver, Carrier, and Shuswap peoples and, during the British colonization of Canada, by fur trappers and miners. Disease and malnutrition resulting from the depletion of game compounded Sekani hardships during this period.
Traditionally a nomadic hunting and gathering culture, the Sekani were divided into several loosely organized independent bands with fluid leadership; the name Sekani, meaning “dwellers on the rocks,” originally denoted only one particular band. Homes were casually built huts or lean-tos, each framed by poles and covered with spruce bark or brush. For food the Sekani preferred moose, caribou, bears, mountain goats, beavers, and other game, which they hunted with snares, bows and arrows, spears, and clubs. They scorned fish, avoiding it unless facing dire food shortages and deriding the neighbouring Carrier as “fisheaters.”
Sekani religious beliefs involved animism, the tenet that spirits or powers exist throughout the natural world among animals, plants, landforms, and weather events such as thunder. Each male had one or more guardian spirits associated with birds or other animals from which he might elicit power on occasions of great need. Shamans were considered able to cause and cure illness (see shamanism).
Early 21st-century population estimates indicated some 1,200 Sekani descendants.
