Niantic,  Algonquian-speaking woodland Indians of southern New England. The Eastern Niantic lived on the western coast of what is now Rhode Island and on the neighbouring coast of Connecticut. The Western Niantic lived on the seacoast from Niantic Bay, just west of New London, to the Connecticut River. Once one tribe, they were apparently split by the migration of the Pequot into their area.
The Western Niantic were nearly destroyed by the Pequot War (1637), and remnants joined the Mohegans. The Eastern Niantic remained neutral during King Philip’s War (1675–76), and at its close many of the defeated Narragansett Indians and their allies settled among them. Thereafter the combined tribes were called Narragansett.
