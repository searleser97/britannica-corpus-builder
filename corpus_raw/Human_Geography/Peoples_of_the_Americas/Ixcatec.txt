Ixcatec,   Middle American Indians living in a single town, Santa María Ixcatlán, in northern Oaxaca, Mex. There were perhaps 10,000 Ixcatec before the Spanish conquest, but their numbers now remain stable at about 200. The Ixcatec language and culture are closely related to those of the neighbouring Chocho (q.v.). They practice subsistance farming, with corn (maize) and beans as the staple crops. The Ixcatec live in towns or villages, from which they go out to farm the surrounding land. Their houses are built in a variety of styles, from thatched huts to adobe and tile houses—the result of cultural change. The chief craft practiced is the weaving of palm-fibre hats for sale. Native dress has been replaced by standard Mexican peasant dress.
The Ixcatec, although they are Roman Catholics, practice a faith that has intermixed some pre-Christian beliefs. The compadrazgo, or godparent relationship, is invoked at baptism, and godparents have obligations to their godchildren at marriage.
