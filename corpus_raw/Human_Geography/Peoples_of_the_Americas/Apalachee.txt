Apalachee,  tribe of North American Indians who spoke a Muskogean language and inhabited the area in northwestern Florida between the Aucilla and Apalachicola rivers above Apalachee Bay. In the 16th century the Spanish explorers Pánfilo de Narváez (in 1528) and Hernando de Soto (in 1539) led expeditions to Apalachee territory.
Traditionally, the tribe was divided into clans that traced descent through the maternal line; chieftainship and office were hereditary, probably in the lineage within the clan. An agricultural people who cultivated corn (maize) and squash, the Apalachee were also noted warriors. They were ultimately subdued about 1600 and missionized by Spanish Franciscans. They continued to prosper (in 1655, 6,000–8,000 Apalachee occupied eight towns, each with a Franciscan mission) until early in the 18th century when Creek (q.v.) tribes to the north, incited by the British, began a series of raids on Apalachee settlements. These attacks culminated in 1703 when an army made up of a few hundred Englishmen and several thousand Creek warriors defeated the combined Spanish and Apalachee. The tribe was almost totally destroyed, and 1,400 Apalachee were removed to Carolina where some of them merged with the Creek. The remnants of the Florida tribe sought the protection of the French at Mobile and in Louisiana.
