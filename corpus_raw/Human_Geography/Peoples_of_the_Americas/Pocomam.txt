Pocomam, also spelled Pokomam,  Mayan Indians of the highlands of eastern Guatemala. The Pocomam are primarily agriculturists; they cultivate corn (maize) and beans and manufacture pottery and charcoal. Houses are built of poles or adobe, with thatch, tile, or tin roofs. The houses are scattered over the countryside, with little congregation even around a church or town hall; territory is divided into cantons, which act as administrative districts and social barriers.
The Pocomam practice ritual kinship involving the choosing of godparents for children at baptism, marriage, or other major occasions. Young unmarried men also enter into ritual friendships called camarader√≠a. There is a rigid class system, status being based on age and wealth. The Pocomam adhere to an admixture of Roman Catholicism, pagan mythology, and belief in sacred places and sacred objects.
