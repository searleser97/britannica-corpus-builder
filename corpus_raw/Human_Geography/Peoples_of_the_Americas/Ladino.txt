Ladino,  Westernized Central American person of predominantly mixed Spanish and indigenous descent. In that sense, ladino is synonymous with mestizo. The word ladino is Spanish (meaning “Latin”), and the ladinos of Central America are not to be confused with those Sephardic Jews who speak the Ladino language. The term came later to apply to anyone—regardless of ancestry—who rejected indigenous culture. Ladinos were accepted by neither the various Maya peoples nor by the Spanish, whose language and manner of dress they adopted and who considered them superior to the Maya but inferior to themselves. The Maya considered them traitors. Ladinos are readily recognizable by their exclusive use of the Spanish language (rather than indigenous languages) and by their decided preference for Western (rather than traditional) dress.
In the 21st century, ladinos were generally city dwellers. Those who have remained in rural areas practice a subsistence agriculture much like that of their indigenous neighbours, although with modern machinery and methods, more stress on cash crops, and more participation in a regional market economy.
