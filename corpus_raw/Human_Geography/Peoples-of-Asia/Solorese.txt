Solorese, also called Solor, or Solot,  tribe inhabiting the Lesser Sunda Islands in Indonesia, specifically Solor, Adonara, Lomblen, and eastern Flores. The Solorese speak three Malayo-Polynesian dialects in the Ambon-Timor language group. They are divided into two opposing groups, the Demon and the Padzi, who have different political and religious beliefs.
Solorese villages of 100–500 people are structured around clan lineages. A clan may be confined to one village or scattered among many. Inheritance is patrilineal. Agricultural land is clan-owned and used for slash-and-burn cultivation of corn (maize) and dry rice. Although most Solorese originally inhabited mountain areas, the influx of Dutch drove some to the coast. These coastal Solorese fish and trade. The Solorese were also influenced by Islāmic and Christian missionaries as early as the 16th century. Today most are Muslim, except for the Roman Catholics on Flores. The indigenous religion honoured the high god Lera Wulan and his female counterpart, Tana Ekan, as well as lesser spirits. Local political decisions are made by the head of the original or land-owning clan and four other ritual leaders.
