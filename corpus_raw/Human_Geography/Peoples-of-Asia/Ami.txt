Ami,   most numerous indigenous ethnic group on the island of Taiwan, numbering more than 124,000 in the late 20th century and located in the fertile but relatively inaccessible southeastern hilly region and along the eastern coastal plain. Of Malay stock, they speak three dialects of an Indonesian-related language, also called Ami. The Ami traditionally practice slash-and-burn agriculture, growing dry rice, millet, sweet potatoes, tobacco, and betel nut. Today, wet rice cultivation is also important. Composed of extended family units, Ami society revolves around villages (each headed by a chief) containing up to 1,000 people. Men and women have equal rights and responsibilities, but clan organization is actually matrilineal; women own property, and the eldest daughter receives the family inheritance. Daily life is closely bound to religious beliefs; each family group has a hereditary priestess and a shaman, who practices dream divination. The Ami honour both ancestral and divine spirits; their most important ceremony is held annually after the millet harvest. The Ami have undergone pronounced acculturation, primarily through trading contacts with the Chinese.
