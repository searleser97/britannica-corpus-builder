Baḍaga,  any member of the largest tribal group living in the Nīlgiri Hills of Tamil Nādu state in southern India. The Baḍaga have increased very rapidly, from fewer than 20,000 in 1871 to about 140,000 in the late 20th century. Their language is a Dravidian dialect closely akin to Kannada as spoken in Karnātaka state to the north of the Nīlgiris. The name Baḍaga means “northerner,” and it is clear that the Baḍaga came into the Nīlgiris from the north, perhaps impelled by economic or political pressures. The time of their migration has been dated sometime after the founding of the Liṅgāyat Hindu sect in the 12th century and before 1602, when their settlement in the area was noted by Roman Catholic priests.
The Baḍaga were divided into six main endogamous groups that were ranked in ritual order. The two highest castes were priests and vegetarians; the lowest caste worked as servants for the other five. Traditional Baḍaga religion and economy also relied on goods and services supplied by the other Nīlgiri peoples—Kota, Toda, and Kurumba.
The Baḍaga generally are agriculturists, but many are engaged in other professions. In addition to grain, Baḍaga farmers grow large crops of potatoes and vegetables. Many have altered their traditional practices. Improved agriculture, local and national policies, and high-caste Hindu tradition are the major concerns of the contemporary Baḍaga.
