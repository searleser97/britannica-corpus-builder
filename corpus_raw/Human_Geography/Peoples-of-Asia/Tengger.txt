Tengger, also called Tenggerese,  second smallest of the ethnic groups indigenous to the island of Java in Indonesia, living mainly on the high slopes of a large volcanic crater in the Tengger Mountains and numbering about 34,000 at the turn of the 21st century. They are believed to be the only surviving remnants of the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit empire from its later period (c. 1500 ce). Because of the high elevation and the climate, the Tengger cannot grow the Indonesian staple crop of rice. They sow corn (maize), potatoes, onions, and cabbage in a two-season year and keep a small number of buffalo. Lacking the economic base for large-scale political integration, the Tengger community unit (with an elected headman) is the village, traditionally consisting of large, thatched wooden houses sheltering several families and surrounded by a bamboo palisade. Although some villagers have converted to Islam, most observe a local religion influenced by Hinduism, with a priest, or dukun, who performs sacrifices on the sacred crater. Historically, the Tengger have largely been isolated from the external influences and cultural interaction typical of coastal Java. In the 21st century, however, the region hosts a year-round stream of domestic and foreign tourists.
