Daur, also spelled Daghor, Daghur, or Dagur, Manchu Dahur, Russian Daur, Chinese (Pinyin) Dawoâ€™er (Wade-Giles romanization) Ta-wo-erh,  Mongol people living mainly in the eastern portion of Inner Mongolia autonomous region and western Heilongjiang province of China and estimated in the early 21st century to number more than 132,000. They are one of the official ethnic minorities of China. Their language, which varies widely enough from other Mongolian languages to once have been thought to be Tungusic or a mixture of Mongolian and Tungus, is now known to be an archaic Mongolian dialect that preserves features found in 13th-century documents. Their name for themselves is Daur.
Russian settlers in the 17th century found the Daur well established in eastern Transbaikalia and the Amur region, and the Orthodox church sent missionaries to them in 1682. The Chinese government, not wishing the Daur to fall under Russian sway, resettled them. By the early 20th century many Daur lived in Heilongjiang, around the city of Hailar, and in the Nen River valley near the city of Qiqihar. Their chief occupations are agriculture, logging, hunting, stock raising, and horse breeding. The clan system prevails. Their religion is shamanistic, although some are adherents of Tibetan Buddhism.
