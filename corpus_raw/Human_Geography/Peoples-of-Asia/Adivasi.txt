Adivasi, (Hindi: “Original Inhabitants”) official name (in India) Scheduled Tribes,  any of various ethnic groups considered to be the original inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent. The term is used primarily in India and Bangladesh. In the constitution of India, promulgated in 1950, most of these groups were listed—or scheduled—as targets for social and economic development. Since that time the Adivasi of India have been known officially as Scheduled Tribes. In the early 21st century the Adivasi population of India was more than 84 million, with the majority living in the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Smaller numbers inhabit the hills and forests of central and southern India as well as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The largest groups are the Bhil, the Munda, and the Santhal. The Adivasi peoples have experienced major changes in their traditional ways of life since the mid-20th century, especially as they lost their lands as a result of population growth, the development of towns, and industrialization.
