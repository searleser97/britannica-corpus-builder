Kayan,  indigenous people of central Borneo. They numbered about 27,000 in the late 20th century. The Kayan are settled mainly along the middle reaches of the Baram, Bintulu, and Rajang rivers in Sarawak, Malaysia. In Indonesian Borneo they live mainly near the headwaters of the Kayan River, in the middle reaches of the Mahakam River—where they are often grouped with the Kenyah and several smaller groups under the general name Bahau, and in the upper Kapuas River basin.
Historically, Kayan villages were located along the banks of rivers that were navigable by canoes. These settlements consisted of one or more longhouses, each of which could contain 50 or more family apartments. The extensive quarters of the chief were situated in the centre of the house and were often decorated with carvings and murals. By the early 21st century, many longhouses had been abandoned in favour of separate family units, particularly in Indonesian Borneo, and a significant segment of the population had relocated to towns and cities closer to the coast.
Rural Kayan generally maintain a subsistence economy based on shifting cultivation, with hill rice grown on clearings in the rainforest. Sago and corn are subsidiary crops. Fishing, hunting, and the collection of forest produce are other important economic activities. In the past, many of the Kayan were skilled blacksmiths, noted for their fine craftsmanship and traditional art. Kayan society has a class system, with class endogamy being marked among the aristocrats; as a whole, however, class distinctions have become less pronounced since the late 20th century. Formerly, the Kayan practiced head-hunting and were in frequent conflict with the Iban and other Dayak groups. In the past, the Kayan practiced an elaborate traditional religion with numerous spirits and such ritual institutions as shamanism and augury. Most Kayan—in both Indonesia and Malaysia—are now Christian.
