Kindah, in full Kindat al-Mulūk (Arabic: “The Royal Kindah”),  ancient Arabian tribe that was especially prominent during the late 5th and 6th centuries ad, when it made one of the first attempts in central Arabia to unite various tribes around a central authority. The Kindah originated in the area west of Ḥaḍramawt in southern Arabia. At the end of the 5th century ad, however, they were led by Ḥujr Ākil al-Murār, the traditional founder of the dynasty, into central and northern Arabia. There they successfully united a number of tribes into a loose confederacy. Ḥujr’s grandson, al-Ḥārith ibn ʿAmr, was the most renowned of the Kindah kings. Al-Ḥārith invaded Iraq and captured al-Ḥīrah, the capital of the Lakhmid king al-Mundhir III. About 529, however, al-Mundhir regained the city and killed al-Ḥārith, together with about 50 other members of the royal family—a devastating blow to Kindah power.
After al-Ḥārith’s death the kingdom split up into four tribes—Asad, Taghlib, Qays, and Kinānah—each led by a Kindah prince. The tribes feuded constantly, and, after about the middle of the 6th century, the Kindah princes were forced by the local tribesmen to withdraw once more to southern Arabia.
During Muslim times, descendants of the Royal Kindah continued to hold prominent court positions, and one branch of the tribe gained great influence in Spain. The famous Arabian poet Imruʾ al-Qays (d. c. 540) was from the Kindah tribe.
