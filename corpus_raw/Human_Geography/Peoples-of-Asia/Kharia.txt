Khaṛiā,   any of several groups of hill people living in the Chota Nāgpur area of Orissa and Bihār states, northeastern India, and numbering more than 280,000 in the late 20th century. Most of the Khaṛiā speak a South Munda language of the Munda family, itself a part of the Austroasiatic stock. They are of uncertain ethnic origin. The Khaṛiā are usually subdivided into three groups: Hill Khaṛiā, Dhelkī, and Dudh. All are patrilineal, with the family as the basic unit, and are led by a tribal government consisting of a priest, a headman, and village leaders. The Hill Khaṛiā speak an Indo-Iranian language and seem otherwise to be a totally separate group. The Dhelkī and the Dudh, both of whom speak the Khaṛiā language, recognize each other—but not the Hill Khaṛiā—as Khaṛiā.
The Dudh are the most numerous and progressive branch; they live along the Sankh and South Koel rivers. The Dhelkī are concentrated near Gāngpur. Both live in settled villages, and intervillage federations enforce the feeling of social solidarity. They traditionally build separate large dormitories for unmarried men and women, but this practice has been abandoned by Christian Khaṛiā. The Khaṛiā’s traditional religion includes a form of sun worship, in which each family head makes five sacrifices to Bero to protect his generation.
The Hill Khaṛiā live in small groups in remote areas of the Simlipal Range in Orissa state. They depend on shifting agriculture, growing rice and millet, but constantly face the problem of land scarcity. They also collect silk cocoons, honey, and beeswax for trade.
