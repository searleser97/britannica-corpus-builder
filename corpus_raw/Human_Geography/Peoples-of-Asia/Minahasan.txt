Minahasan,  people inhabiting the northernmost extension of the island of Celebes (Sulawesi), Indonesia, in and around the port town of Manado. Their population was about 670,000 at the turn of the 21st century.
In traditional rural settings, the Minahasan are organized patrilineally under headmen, with land owned communally by each village. Extended families are bound to undivided estates that are apportioned according to the needs of each household. Class distinctions are no longer significant in community definition; members of a geographical area compose the basic political unit. Internally, the rural Minahasan are divided into special societies called mapalus, which provide reciprocal agricultural assistance. Wet and dry rice, corn (maize), sago palms, coffee, tobacco, and cocoa are the principal crops.
As a result of the influx of Portuguese Roman Catholic missionaries about 1850, the Minahasan are almost entirely Christian and most are well-educated. Today the Minahasan are engaged in a broad spectrum of activities. Some may hold administrative posts on Java, while others may be prosperous owners of coconut plantations.
