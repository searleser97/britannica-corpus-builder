Kachin,  tribal peoples occupying parts of northeastern Myanmar (Burma) and contiguous areas of India (Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland) and China (Yunnan). The greatest number of Kachin live in Myanmar (roughly 590,000), but some 120,000 live in China and a few thousand in India. Numbering about 712,000 in the late 20th century, they speak a variety of languages of the Tibeto-Burman group and are thereby distinguished as Jinghpaw, or Jingpo (Chingpaw [Ching-p’o], Singhpo), Atsi, Maru (Naingvaw), Lashi, Nung (Rawang), and Lisu (Yawyin). The majority of Kachin are Jinghpaw speakers, and Jinghpaw is one of the officially recognized minority languages of China. Under the British regime (1885–1947), most Kachin territory was specially administered as a frontier region, but most of the area inhabited by the Kachin became after Burmese independence a distinct semiautonomous unit within the country.
Traditional Kachin society largely subsisted on the shifting cultivation of hill rice, supplemented by the proceeds of banditry and feud warfare. Political authority in most areas lay with petty chieftains who depended upon the support of their immediate patrilineal kinsmen and their affinal relatives. The Kachin live in mountainous country at a low population density, but Kachin territory also includes small areas of fertile valley land inhabited by other peoples of Myanmar. The traditional Kachin religion is a form of animistic ancestor cult entailing animal sacrifice. As a result of the arrival of American and European missionaries in Burma beginning in the late 19th century, a majority of the Kachin are Christian, mainly Baptist and Roman Catholic. Among the Kachin in India, Buddhism predominates.
