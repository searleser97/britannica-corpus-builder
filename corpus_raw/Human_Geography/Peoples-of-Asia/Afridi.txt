Afrīdī,  Pashtun tribe inhabiting the hill country from the eastern spurs of the Spīn Ghar Range to northern Pakistan. The Afrīdīs, whose territory straddles the Khyber Pass, are of uncertain origin.
Fighting between the Afrīdīs and the troops of the Mughal dynasty of India occurred frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 18th century the Afghan ruler Aḥmad Shāh Durrānī employed Afrīdīs in his armies, and his grandson Shāh Shojāʿ (reigned 1803–09) received both support and asylum from them.
British encounters with the Afrīdīs began during the first Anglo-Afghan War (1839–42), notably when General George Pollock fought against them during his march to Kabul. After the British annexation of the Punjab in 1849, various methods were tried to keep the Khyber Pass open, including allowances, punitive expeditions such as those of 1878 and 1879 against the Kohāt and Khyber Afrīdīs, and the use of tribal militia (the Khyber Rifles). In 1893 the Afrīdīs of the Khyber region came under control by the Durand Line, which divided the tribal region between Afghanistan and British India.
During the 1930s the Indian Congress Party enlisted Afrīdī support for the militant anti-British Red Shirt Movement, an amalgam of pan-Islāmism and Indian nationalism. With independence, the Afrīdī lands in the North-West Frontier Province became a part of Pakistan, which thereafter faced an Afghan-supported movement for an independent Pakhtunistan, or Pashtun state.
