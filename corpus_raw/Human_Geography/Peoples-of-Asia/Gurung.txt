Gurung,   people of Nepal living mainly on the southern flank of the AnnapÅ«rna mountain massif. Their numbers are estimated at about 200,000. The Gurung speak a language of the Tibeto-Burman family. Many are Lamaist Buddhists in religion, while others have adopted Hinduism. They make their living in agriculture and livestock raising. Along with the Magar, Rai, and other Nepalese ethnic groups, they have won fame as the Gurkha soldiers of the British and Indian armies.
They trace their descent along paternal lines and are organized into two groups, or moieties, of patrilineal clans, one group being of higher social status than the other.
