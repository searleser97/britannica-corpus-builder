Bhutia, also spelled Bhotia, also called Bhote or Ngalops,  Himalayan people who are believed to have emigrated southward from Tibet in the 8th or 9th century ce. The Bhutia constitute a majority of the population of Bhutan, where they live mainly in the western and central regions of the country, and form minorities in Nepal and India, particularly in the Indian state of Sikkim. They speak various languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. They are mountain dwellers who live in small villages and isolated homesteads that are separated by almost impassable terrain. They practice a terraced agriculture on the mountain slopes, their main crops being rice, corn (maize), and potatoes. Some of them are animal breeders, known for their cattle and yaks.
Most Bhutia practice a form of Tibetan Buddhism, a Central Asian–Himalayan version of Vajrayana. More specifically, most are followers of the Drukpa subsect of Kagyu (Bka’-brgyud-pa), which is one of the two (of four) branches of Vajrayana practiced in Bhutan. Bhutanese Buddhism contains an admixture of the pre-Buddhist shamanism known as Bon. Drukpa adherents recognize the Gyalwang Drukpa as their spiritual leader.
Traditional Bhutia society was feudalistic, with most of the population working as tenants of a landowning nobility, although there were few marked differences in ways of life between landowners and tenants. Slaves, most of them descended from captives taken in raids on Indian territory, were also part of the social order. In the 1960s Bhutan’s government formally abolished slavery and sought to break up the large estates; the nobility were also deprived of their hereditary titles.
