Semang,  people who live mostly in peninsular Malaysia and speak an Austro-Asiatic language. In the early 21st century their population was estimated to be approximately 2,000. They are traditional nomadic hunters, using blowguns to hunt small game, and gatherers of wild roots and fruits. Most groups also now practice some agriculture. For shelter they use caves or rock overhangs or build leaf-covered windscreens. The Semang live in autonomous local bands consisting of an elder male (usually the leader of the group), his wife, their sons, and the sonsâ€™ wives and children. Their religious beliefs are complex and include numerous deities. Shaman-priests practice magic, foresee the future, and cure illness.
