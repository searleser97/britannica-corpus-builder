Sanka, (Japanese: “Mountain Cave”)  outcaste group of people in Japan. The Sanka are sometimes called the Japanese Gypsies, wandering in small bands through the mountainous regions of Honshu. They are not distinguishable in either physical type or language from the rest of the Japanese.
Little is known of their history. Although they are mentioned in Japanese chronicles from the 11th century, much of the information about them is vague. Like other depressed castes in Japan, they had chiefs through whom they dealt with feudal authority and who were responsible for the conduct of the group. There is no evidence to support the claim that they were a wild people who lived in caves. In their mountain habitat they seem to have been wood gatherers, charcoal burners, and hunters. Despite Japanese legislation against social discrimination, their descendants are still regarded with contempt much like that shown the Burakumin.
