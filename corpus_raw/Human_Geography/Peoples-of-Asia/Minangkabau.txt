Minangkabau, Malay Urang Padang (“People of the Plains”),  largest ethnic group on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, whose traditional homeland is the west-central highlands. The Minangkabau have extensive terraced fields and garden plots in which they raise irrigated rice, tobacco, and cinnamon, as well as fruits and vegetables. Their crafts include wood carving, metalworking, and weaving. Their language, closely resembling Malay, belongs to the Austronesian language family. In the early 21st century they numbered approximately eight million. Although Muslim, the Minangkabau are matrilineal, tracing descent and inheritance through the female line. Traditionally, a married couple stayed in the house of the wife’s maternal relatives; the husband, however, was  considered a guest who visited his wife at night.
The domestic unit was traditionally the rumah gadang (“big house”; community house), which was under the control of a head woman, her sisters, their daughters, and their female children. Boys lived in the house until they were circumcized, after which they resided in the local mosque until they were married. The community house was a large rectangular structure, raised high above the ground, with a saddle-shaped roof. A main room occupied much of the structure. Adjoining it were the living compartments, each occupied by a woman, her children, and her husband.
Members of several  community houses made up the suku (clan), which was an exogamous entity; that is, marriage between clan members was not allowed. Several clans made up the negari, the largest unit of government, roughly equivalent in size to a village, which was administered by a council. Since World War II the traditional kinship structure has declined in importance, and many nuclear families have left the village to establish their own households. Some of the kin-group land has become the personal property of these households.
Some Minangkabau migrated to Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) in the late 19th century and formed a confederation of small states that came to be known as Negri Sembilan (Nine States). Minangkabau tribesmen, who closely resembled the peninsular Malay, left Sumatra to seek greater economic opportunity across the Strait of Malacca. Rapid expansion of Malayan tin mining after 1850 lured increasing numbers of Minangkabau as miners or as petty merchants. The immigrants secured transit to Malaya by selling property or receiving assisted passage in return for contract mine labour. By the beginning of the 20th century, however, capital-intensive mining displaced Minangkabau miners, who then shifted to agricultural pursuits in interior river valleys. Land was plentiful, and the Minangkabau frequently gained title to land by clearing, planting, and living on it. Malay sultans raised no objections to these linguistically Malay immigrants, who partially offset the influx of Chinese labourers. Minangkabau immigrants became successful smallholder farmers, and they ultimately came to control much of the retail trade in the Malay Peninsula.
