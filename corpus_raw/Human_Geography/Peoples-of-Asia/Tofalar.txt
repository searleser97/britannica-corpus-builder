Tofalar, also called Karagas, Karaga, or Tubalar,  Turkic-speaking people of southern Siberia who numbered about 800 in the mid-1980s. Their traditional habitat was the northern slopes of the Eastern Sayan Mountains, where they lived by nomadic hunting and reindeer breeding. Of all the peoples of Siberia, only the Tofalar failed to develop the technology of automatic traps, relying instead on pitfalls for the larger hooved animals. Since the mid-17th century they have been under powerful Russian cultural influence.
The Tofalar are of mixed origin; they are close to the Tuvinian in language, culture, and history. The languages of both peoples were originally Uralic, but in the last several centuries they have given way to Turkic languages and Russian. Little is known of Tofalar history before Russian contact.
Their traditional social organization was based on patrilineal clans. Members of the same clan did not marry one another. Both in social organization and in their shamanistic religion they were typical of indigenous Siberian peoples. The Soviet authorities collectivized them and settled them in permanent villages, and their economy is now based on cooperative fur farming. Their traditional tents (in winter of hide and in summer of birch bark) were replaced by wooden houses of Russian type. See also Tyvan.
