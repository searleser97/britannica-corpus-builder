Tetum, also spelled Tetun, orTettum,  people indigenous to the narrow central section of Timor, easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia. The Tetum numbered more than 300,000 in the late 20th century. Of Melanesian and Indonesian-Malay stock, the Tetum may be descendants of invaders who brought Indonesian culture to Timor. The Tetum speak a Malayo-Polynesian dialect and practice slash-and-burn cultivation of corn (maize), sweet potatoes, dry rice, and vegetables. Fields are sown around a corn shrine. They also raise pigs and a few buffalo. The basic social and economic unit is the household, which usually consists of an extended family. The Tetum village, composed of large houses built on pilings, is governed by a headman, who in turn is supervised by a chief. Both men and women play distinctive and important parts in agricultural rituals. Believing that women represent the sacred world and men the secular, the Tetum observe complex rites that are meant to join the sacred and secular worlds, thus ensuring a good harvest. Religious shamans, female or male, act as interpreters of spirits. Tetum clan descent is usually patrilineal. Polygamy has died out under the influence of Christianity.
