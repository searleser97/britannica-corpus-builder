Tangut,  people historically living in what are now the northwestern Chinese provinces of Gansu and Shaanxi and the southwestern portion of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. They engaged in irrigated agriculture and pastoralism and—taking advantage of their location at the eastern end of the Silk Road—acted as middlemen in trade between Central Asia and China. They adopted Buddhism as their state religion, created their own writing system, and in 1038 proclaimed their kingdom of Xi Xia, which survived nearly 200 years.
