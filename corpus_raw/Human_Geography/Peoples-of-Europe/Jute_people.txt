Jute,   member of a Germanic people who, with the Angles and Saxons, invaded Britain in the 5th century ad. The Jutes have no recorded history on the European continent, but there is considerable evidence that their home was in the Scandinavian area (probably Jutland) and that those who did not migrate were later absorbed by the Danes. According to the Venerable Bede, the Jutes settled in Kent, the Isle of Wight, and parts of Hampshire. In Kent their name soon died out, but there is considerable evidence in the social structure of that area that its settlers were of a different race from their neighbours. There is archaeological evidence to confirm Bedeâ€™s statement that the Isle of Wight and Kent were settled by the same people, and their presence in Hampshire is confirmed by place-names.
