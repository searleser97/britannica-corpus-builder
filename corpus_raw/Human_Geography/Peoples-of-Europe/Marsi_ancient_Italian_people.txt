Marsi,  ancient people of Italy, located on the eastern shore of Lake Fucinus (now drained) in the modern province of L’Aquila. In 304 bc the Marsi and their allies, the Vestini, Paeligni, and Marrucini, made an alliance with Rome that lasted until the Social War, sometimes called the Marsic War (91 bc onward). This war ended when the allies were finally given Roman citizenship.
The earliest pure Latin inscriptions of the Marsi are dated to about 150 bc, whereas the earliest inscriptions in the local dialect date from about 300 to 150 bc. The Marsi were among those who worshipped Angitia, a goddess of healing, and because they practiced primitive medicine, their country was held by the Romans to be the home of witchcraft. The name of the tribe is derived from the god Mars.
Marsi was also the name of an ancient Germanic tribe located between the Ruhr and Lippe rivers. Defeated during the Roman campaigns in ad 14–16, they then disappeared from history.
