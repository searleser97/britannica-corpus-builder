Bituriges,   Celtic tribe that in about 600 bc was the most powerful in Gaul. By about 500 bc the tribe was divided into two groups: the Cubi, with a capital at Avaricum (modern Bourges) in the region later known as Berry; and the Vivisci, with a capital at the port of Burdigala (modern Bordeaux) on the shore of the Gironde Estuary. During the Gallic revolt of 52 bc, the Cubi defended Avaricum, but Julius Caesar destroyed the town and its inhabitants. Both groups were later included in the Roman administrative district of Aquitania (modern Aquitaine).
