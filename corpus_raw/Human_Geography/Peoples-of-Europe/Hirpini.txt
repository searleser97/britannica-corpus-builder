Hirpini,   in ancient times, an inland Samnite tribe in the south of Italy. To the north of them were the Pentri and Caraceni, who, with the Hirpini and Caudini, constituted the Samnite confederation in the wars of the 4th century bc. The Roman policy of separation cut the Hirpini off from these allies by the refoundation of their town of Maleventum as the Latin colony of Beneventum in 268, and thereafter they were a separate unit. They sided with Carthage against Rome in 216, remaining independent until receiving the Roman franchise in 82. Apart from Beneventum (Benevento) their chief towns were Abellinum (Avellino) and Aeclanum.
