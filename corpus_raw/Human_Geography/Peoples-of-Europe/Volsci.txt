Volsci,   ancient Italic people prominent in the history of Roman expansion during the 5th century bc. They belonged to the Osco-Sabellian group of tribes and lived (c. 600 bc) in the valley of the upper Liris River. Later events, however, drove them first westward and then south to the fertile land of southern Latium.
Knowledge of the Volsci depends largely upon Roman accounts of their mutual wars. To increase their pressure against Rome and the Latins, the Volsci allied themselves with the Aequi. Rome and the Latins in turn joined in alliance with the Hernici, who lived between the Aequi and the Volsci. For about 200 years campaigns dragged on intermittently between these opponents. The Volsci are said to have made peace with Rome in 396 but profited by Romeâ€™s weakness after the Gauls sacked the city in 390 to renew their warfare. In the course of these struggles the Romans established several colonies in the 5th and 4th centuries to stem the advance of the Volsci. In 340 the Volsci joined the Latin revolt but were defeated (338), and they had finally submitted to Rome by 304. Thereafter they became Romanized so quickly and completely that it is difficult to ascertain their original culture. Their language is known from an inscription (early 3rd century) from Velitrae.
