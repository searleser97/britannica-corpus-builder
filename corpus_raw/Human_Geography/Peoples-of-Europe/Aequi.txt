Aequi,   ancient people of Italy originally inhabiting the region watered by the tributaries of the Avens River (modern Velino). Long hostile to Rome, they became especially menacing in the 5th century bc, advancing to the Alban Hills. Although repulsed by the Romans in 431, the Aequi were not completely subdued by Rome until the end of the Second Samnite War (304 bc), when they received civitas sine suffragio (“citizenship without voting rights”). The establishment of the Latin colony of Carsioli (302 bc) and the extension of the Via Valeria through the territory of the Aequi aided the rapid Romanization of that people.
