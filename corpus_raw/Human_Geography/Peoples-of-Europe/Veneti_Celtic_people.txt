Veneti,   ancient Celtic people who lived in what is now the Morbihan district of modern Brittany. By the time of Julius Caesar they controlled all Atlantic trade to Britain. They submitted to Caesar in 57 bc; but the next winter, disturbed by his interest in Britain, they seized some Roman commissariat officers and, with the support of several maritime states, attempted to regain independence. Caesar built galleys in the Loire River and in the late summer of 56 met the Venetic fleet of more than 200 ships in Quiberon Bay and destroyed it. After his victory Caesar executed the tribal elders and sold the rest of the people. By some means, however, the tribe as such survived and is attested in imperial times.
