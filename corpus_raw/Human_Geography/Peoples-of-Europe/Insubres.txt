Insubres,   the most powerful Celtic people of Gallia Cisalpina (Cisalpine Gaul), in northern Italy. Despite their defeat at Clastidium (modern Casteggio) by Roman forces in 222 bc, they continued to be troublesome and aided the Carthaginian general Hannibal in the Second Punic War (218â€“201 bc). The Insubres were finally subdued in 196 bc and gradually lost their identity in the rise of municipal communities. They were granted Latin rights in 89 bc and full Roman citizenship 40 years later.
