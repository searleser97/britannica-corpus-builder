Chuvash,   ethnic minority in western Russia who constitute the majority of the population of Chuvashia. Another 850,000 Chuvash are found in other parts of Russia.
The Chuvash speak a Turkic language and claim to be descended from the Bolgars who in the 4th century ad migrated from Central Asia to the region west of the Volga River. It is not unlikely that they represent an amalgamation of Bolgars with the tribes then living in the area. Their language is very different from other Turkic languages. The Chuvash are nominally Russian Orthodox; both their remaining traditional beliefs and their nominal religion, however, are said to be in decline.
