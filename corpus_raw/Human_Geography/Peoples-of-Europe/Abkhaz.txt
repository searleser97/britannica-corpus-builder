Abkhaz, also called Abkhazian, Abkhaz Apswa,  any member of a Caucasian people living chiefly in the Abkhazia republic in northwesternmost Georgia. The Bzyb Abkhaz, who have a distinct dialect, are found around the Bzyb River; the Abzhui Abkhaz, on whose dialect the literary language is based, live near the Kodori River; and the Zamurzakan Abkhaz are found in the southeast. The Abaza people, who speak a similar language, dwell north of the main Caucasus mountain chain around the sources of the Kuban and Zelenchuk rivers in Karachay-Cherkessia, Russia. Abaza and Abkhaz are so similar that many linguists consider them to be dialects of a single language. The traditional economy of the Abkhaz is based on cattle breeding, agriculture, viticulture, and beekeeping. In religion they are chiefly SunnÄ«te Muslims and Eastern Orthodox Christians.
