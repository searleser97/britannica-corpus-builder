Mordvin, also called Mordvinian,  member of a people speaking a Finno-Ugric language of the Uralic language family and living mainly in Mordvinia republic and other parts of the middle Volga River region of Russia. Under the Soviet government the Mordvins were given some autonomy in 1928, and a Mordvinian autonomous republic, which lasted from 1934 to 1991, had its capital at Saransk. The Mordvin numbered more than 800,000 in the early 21st century, with about a third living in Mordvinia and the remainder outside of their traditional homeland. They are divided into two dialect groups, the Moksha and Erzya, whose members have been known to identify themselves as separate ethnic groups; the name Mordvin is an exonym, or name used primarily by outsiders.
Traditionally agricultural, the Mordvin are noted as master beekeepers. The old national costume still may be seen, especially among the women, whose profusely embroidered skirts, large earrings, and numerous necklaces distinguish them from Russians. Many modern Mordvin cannot speak their mother tongues, but a considerable Cyrillic literature of Mordvin songs and legends exists, some recounting the feats of their king Tushtyan, a contemporary of Ivan IV the Terrible. Mordvin religion consists of a Christian veneer over more traditional beliefs. The practice of pretending to kidnap brides in the face of mock resistance has been reported to persist.
