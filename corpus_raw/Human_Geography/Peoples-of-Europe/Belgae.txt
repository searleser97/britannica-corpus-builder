Belgae,  any of the inhabitants of Gaul north of the Sequana and Matrona (Seine and Marne) rivers. The term was apparently first applied by Julius Caesar. Evidence suggests that the Roman influence penetrated into those areas about 150 bc.
The Belgae of Gaul formed a coalition against Caesar after his first Gallic campaign but were subdued the following year (57 bc). One northern tribe, the Eburones, revolted in 53 and slaughtered 15 Roman cohorts; in revenge they were virtually exterminated, and new tribes crossed the Rhine River to replace them.
During the late 2nd or early 1st century bc, a small band of Belgae crossed to Britain. After further Gallic victories (54â€“51 bc) by Caesar, other settlers took refuge across the Channel, and Belgic culture spread to most of lowland Britain. The three most important Belgic kingdoms, identified by their coinage, were centred at Colchester, St. Albans, and Silchester. The chief Belgic contribution to southern Britain was the introduction of the heavy plow, which was used to clear many lands previously untillable.
