Cenomani,   a Celtic people of Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) who, during the 3rd and 2nd centuries bc, allied with the Romans against other Gallic tribes. After first joining the uprising led by the Carthaginian Hamilcar, an agent of Hannibal in Gaul, in 200 bc, they deserted the Insubres (q.v.) during the battle at Larius Lacus (Lake Como) in 196 bc and made their own treaty with the Romans. Their territory was probably bounded by the Ollius (Oglio), Padus (Po), and Athesis (Adige) rivers.
