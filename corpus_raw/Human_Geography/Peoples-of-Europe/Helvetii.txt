Helvetii,   a Celtic people who, under pressure from Germanic peoples in the 2nd century bc, migrated from southern Germany into what is now northern Switzerland. In 61 bc, still pressed upon by the Germans, the Helvetii under Orgetorix decided to migrate to western Gaul; more than 250,000 of them embarked in March 58 bc. Julius Caesar, then governor of Gaul, refused them entry and followed them up the Saone, where he defeated them near Bibracte (q.v.). The rump of the Helvetian force returned to Switzerland.
Under Augustus their territory formed part of Gallia Belgica. The capital at Aventicum (Avenches) became a Roman colony, and the baths at Aquae Helveticae (Baden, Switz.) attracted many visitors. Under the empire the Helvetii manned the Roman frontier forts against the Alamanni but yielded to their traditional enemies by the mid-5th century. The name Helvetia or Confederatio Helvetica survives as an official name of Switzerland.
