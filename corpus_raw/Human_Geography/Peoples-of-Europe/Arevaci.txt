Arevaci,  a Celtiberian tribe, thought by Classical writers to have formed from the mingling of pre-Roman Iberians and Celts, who inhabited an area near Numantia and Uxama in what is now Spain. The Celtiberians excelled at horsemanship, fighting, and metalworking. They wore sewn garments made of woven and dyed cloth.
The Arevaci and the Belli rose up against the Romans in the Celtiberian War, which lasted from 153 to 133 bc. After such victories as that of 137 bc, in which 20,000 Romans surrendered to between 4,000 and 8,000 Celtiberians at Numantia, the tribesâ€™ resistance was broken by the Roman siege and destruction of Numantia in 133 bc.
