Marrucini,  ancient tribe that occupied a small area around Teate (modern Chieti) on the east coast of Italy. The Marrucini, though Samnite kinsmen, were probably not members of the Samnite league; they did, however, come into conflict with the Romans during the Second Samnite War, at the end of which they entered the Roman alliance (304 bc). They were loyal to Rome until they joined with other Italians in the Social War of 91 bc; after the war they were enrolled in the Roman tribe Arnensis. Their language is known from an inscription, the “Bronze of Rapino” (c. 250 bc). It is written in the Latin alphabet but in a dialect of the Northern Oscan group, which included the Paeligni and Vestini.
