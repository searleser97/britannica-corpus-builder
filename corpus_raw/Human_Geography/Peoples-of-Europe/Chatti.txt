Chatti,   Germanic tribe that became one of the most powerful opponents of the Romans during the 1st century ad. At that time the Chatti expanded from their homeland near the upper Visurgis (Weser) River, across the Taunus highlands to the Moenus (Main) River valley, defeating the Cherusci and other neighbouring tribes. In ad 83 the emperor Domitian drove them back from the Taunus. They continued to trouble the Romans, allying in 89 with the rebel governor of Upper Germany, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, and raiding Roman territory in 162, 170, and 213. They may have been incorporated in the coalition of the Franks in the 3rd century ad.
