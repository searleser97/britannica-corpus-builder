Volcae,  in ancient Gaul, a Celtic tribe divided into two sections: the Tectosages, of the valley of the upper Garonne River around Tolosa (Toulouse), and the Arecomici, of the right bank of the Rhône River with their centre at Nemausus (Nîmes). Both areas were included in the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul (later Narbonensis) in 121 bce.
The Tectosages took part in the Celtic invasion of Greece and Asia Minor in the 3rd century bce, but the gold for which Tolosa was famous was probably amassed locally rather than, as some ancients believed, derived from the plunder of the temple at Delphi.
