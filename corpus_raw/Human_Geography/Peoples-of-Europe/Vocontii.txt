Vocontii,   a Celtic tribe of the Gallic province of Narbonensis; its members probably lived in the western foothills of the Alps. Subjugated by the Romans (125–124 bc), they were a civitas foederata (“allied state”) with two capitals—Vasio (Vaison-la-Romaine) and Lucus Augusti (Luc-en-Diois). Excavations at Vaison have shown that the Roman town was built north of an earlier hill fort; uncovered among the Roman ruins were a theatre, portico, and two groups of houses.
