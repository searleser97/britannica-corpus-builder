Lullubi,   ancient group of tribes that inhabited the Sherizor plain in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. A warlike people, they were especially active during the reign of the Akkadian king Naram-Sin (reigned c. 2254–c. 2218 bc) and at the end of the dynasty of Akkad (2334–2154 bc). The Lullubi were apparently subjugated by Naram-Sin, who commemorated his triumph on a masterpiece of Mesopotamian sculpture, the Naram-Sin stele; the tribes, however, soon regained their independence and resumed harassment of southern Mesopotamia, helping to bring an end to the Akkadian empire. Later overshadowed by their more powerful neighbours, the Lullubi remained a source of unrest almost to the end of Mesopotamian history.
