Chamorro,  indigenous people of Guam. The ancestors of the Chamorro are thought to have come to the Mariana Islands from insular Southeast Asia (Indonesia and the Philippines) about 1600 bce. It is estimated that in the early 17th century there were between 50,000 and 100,000 Chamorro in the Marianas, but the disease and violence wrought by the Spanish reduced the Chamorro population to about 1,000 by 1820. During this period the Spanish eliminated the Chamorro on Saipan and relocated the Chamorro from across the Marianas to Guam. By the late 20th century there were about 50,600 Chamorro descendents on Guam whose ethnic background included a considerable admixture of Spanish, Filipino (based on Tagalog), and other strains. Their vernacular, called the Chamorro language, is not a Micronesian dialect but a distinct language with its own vocabulary and grammar. The Chamorro language is still used in many homes on Guam, though English is the islandâ€™s official language. The Chamorro are predominately Roman Catholic.
