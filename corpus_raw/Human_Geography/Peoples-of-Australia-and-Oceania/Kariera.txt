Kariera,   Aboriginal tribe of Western Australia that became one of the type groups for the study of Aboriginal social organization and religion. The Kariera originally occupied the coastal and neighbouring inland regions in the vicinity of Port Hedland and part of the Yule and Turner rivers. The tribe was composed of about 20 to 25 local groups, each with its own territory of 100–200 square miles (260–320 square km); there was an average of about 30 persons per group.
Groups were patrilineal (i.e., descent was traced through the male line) and exogamous (wives came to live in the husband’s territory). Members of the local group often camped together, each family of parents and children having its own shelter. There were four named tribal sections, or categories, and when a man of one section married a woman of another, the children became members of a third section. Local groups were named after a plant or animal species and constituted the religious, or totemic, unit; each region contained a ceremonial ground, or totem centre, on which the men performed rituals. Men hunted and fished, and women gathered wild seeds and roots.
