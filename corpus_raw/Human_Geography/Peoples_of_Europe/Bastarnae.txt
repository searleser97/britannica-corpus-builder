Bastarnae,  in Hellenistic and Roman times, large tribe settled in Europe east of the Carpathian Mountains from the upper valley of the Dniester River to the Danube River delta. The Bastarnae were used by the Macedonian kings Philip V and Perseus against their Thracian enemies and by Mithradates of Pontus against the Romans. The name Peucini, occasionally applied to the tribe, properly belonged only to part of it. Pliny and Tacitus, as well as recent archaeological discoveries, confirm the Germanic origins of the tribe. Subdued by the Roman general Marcus Licinius Crassus in 29 bc, the Bastarnae caused the Romans little trouble until the 3rd century ad, when they joined with other tribes in raiding Roman territory. The Roman emperor Probus then transplanted them to the southern bank of the Danube (ad 279â€“280).
