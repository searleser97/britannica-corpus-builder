Rugi,   Germanic tribe that migrated from southwest Norway to Pomerania around ad 100 and from there to the Danube River valley. They were allies of Attila until his death (453) and then settled in what is now Austria. They then joined with the Ostrogothic army of Theodoric in its campaign to take over Italy in 488â€“493. The Rugi, who converted to Arianism by 482, suffered a crushing defeat in Vienna at the hands of Odoacer, king of Italy, in 487. The remaining Rugi followed Theodoric for revenge, although they maintained their independence even within the Ostrogothic state, keeping their own administrators and avoiding intermarriage with the Goths. They disappeared with the fall of the Ostrogothic state.
