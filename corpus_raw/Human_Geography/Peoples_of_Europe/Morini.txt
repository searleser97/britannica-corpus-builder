Morini,   ancient Celtic people living in the northwestern part of the region between the Seine and the Rhine rivers at the period when Julius Caesar began his conquest of Gaul. Closely allied to two other tribes, the Ambiani and the Atrebates, the Morini were separated from the Atrebates in the Roman division of the province. Up to this time the Celts were organized by tribes, groups related by kinship, that formed a military band at need. They were excellent ironworkers and horsemen, living in small agricultural settlements. The last historical record of the Morini reports that they revolted against Rome in 33 bc and again in 30 bc.
