Briton,  one of a people inhabiting Britain before the Anglo-Saxon invasions beginning in the 5th century ad. Although it was once thought that the Britons descended from the Celts, it is now believed that they were the indigenous population and that they remained in contact with their European neighbours through trade and other social exchanges.
