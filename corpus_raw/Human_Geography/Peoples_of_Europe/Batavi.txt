Batavi,  ancient Germanic tribe from whom Batavia, a poetic name for the Netherlands, is derived. The Batavi inhabited what is now the Betuwe district of the Netherlands, around Lugdunum Batavorum (Leiden), at the mouth of the Rhine River. Subjugated by Rome in 12 ce, they became an “allied people” (gens foederata) and furnished troops for the Roman army until their rebellion under Gaius Julius Civilis (69–70 ce). In the 4th century the Salian Franks displaced the Batavi.
