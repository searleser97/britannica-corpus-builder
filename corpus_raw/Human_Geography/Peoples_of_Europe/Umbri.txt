Umbri, English Umbrians,  ancient pre-Etruscan people who gradually concentrated in Umbria (in central Italy) in response to Etruscan and Gallic pressure. By about 400 bc the inhabitants of this area spoke an Indo-European dialect closely related to Oscan (Umbrian). It is best known from the ritual texts called the Iguvine Tables. The Umbri never fought any important wars against the Romans; in the Social War (90â€“89 bc), for instance, they joined the rebel allies tardily and were among the first to make peace with Rome. Ancient authors described the Umbri as closely resembling their Etruscan enemies in their habits, and the Umbrian alphabet was undoubtedly of Etruscan origin.
