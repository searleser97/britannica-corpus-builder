Sicani, English Sicans,  according to ancient Greek writers, the aboriginal inhabitants of central Sicily, as distinguished from the Siculi of eastern Sicily and the Elymi of western Sicily. Archaeologically there is no substantial difference between Sicani and Siculi (Sicels) in historical times; but the Greek historian Thucydides believed the Sicani to be Iberians from Spain who were driven by the invading Siculi into the central parts of the island.
