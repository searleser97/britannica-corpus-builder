Jersey Act, also called Jersey Law,  resolution passed in 1913 by the English Jockey Club and named after its sponsor, Victor Albert George, 7th Earl of Jersey, one of the club stewards. It declared that the only horses and mares acceptable for registration in the General Stud Book would be those that could be traced in all their lines to sires and dams already registered therein. The Act effectively disqualified as Thoroughbreds many horses bred outside England or Ireland, including the majority of North American horses. With the shutdown in 1911 and 1912 of racing in New York, the major American racing centre and bloodstock market, an invasion of American bloodstock into England became a threat, and the Act was ostensibly intended to protect the British Thoroughbred from infusions of American blood. The resulting complications of recognizing outstanding horses, however, caused ill feeling among American and French breeders. In 1949, following a rash of victories in prestigious English races by French horses with “impure” American blood, the Law was modified to qualify animals on which eight or nine crosses of pure blood could be traced for at least a century and for which turf performances of the immediate family could be shown as a warrant of blood purity. Not all American Thoroughbreds then became qualified for registration in the General Stud Book, but the ill feeling was eliminated.
