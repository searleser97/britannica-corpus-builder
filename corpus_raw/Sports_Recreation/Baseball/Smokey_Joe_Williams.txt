Smokey Joe Williams, byname of Joseph Williams,  (born April 6, 1886?, Seguin, Texas, U.S.—died Feb. 25, 1951?, New York, N.Y.), American baseball player who was an early star of the Negro leagues.
Williams was a 6-foot 4-inch (1.93 metre) right-handed pitcher who combined a high-velocity fastball with very good control. Williams was occasionally called “Cyclone,” a nickname, like “Smokey,” derived from the speed of his pitch. He played between 1905 and 1932, in an era when record keeping was less than accurate and sometimes nonexistent. There is not even agreement on his birth and death dates (the dates cited here are from the Baseball Hall of Fame). The same uncertainty exists when attempting to document Williams’s career. Many of his important accomplishments were not recorded in newspapers but were simply passed by word of mouth. Nonetheless, many observers of Negro league baseball consider Williams the best black pitcher of all time, even superior to the legendary Satchel Paige.
During his 27-year career, Williams played with 11 teams, although most of his time was split between two clubs: the New York Lincoln Giants and the Homestead Grays. He began his career near his hometown, pitching for independent black baseball teams in San Antonio and Austin, Texas. He reportedly won 28 games in 1905 and 32 games in 1909. In 1912 Williams went to New York City to play with the Lincoln Giants and was with them off and on until 1925, when he joined the Homestead Grays. He remained with Homestead until he retired in 1932. In 1930 Williams recorded 27 strikeouts in a 12-inning game against the Kansas City Monarchs. In exhibition games that Williams pitched against teams composed of white major leaguers, he won 20 games and lost 7. Williams also played in Cuba for three winter seasons, winning 22 games and losing 15. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1999.
