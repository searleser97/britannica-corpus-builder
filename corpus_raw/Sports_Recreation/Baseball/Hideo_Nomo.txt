Nomo Hideo, byname the Tornado,  (born August 31, 1968, Osaka, Japan), professional baseball player. In 1995 Nomo became the first Japanese citizen to join an American major league team after having played professionally in the Japanese major leagues. (The first player born in Japan to appear on a major league team in the United States, however, was Masanori Murakami, who played in the minor leagues in Japan before pitching for the San Francisco Giants in 1964 and ’65.)
After graduating from high school, Nomo pitched in the Japanese Industrial League and also became a member of Japan’s national team, which won the silver medal in baseball at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea. In 1989 he was drafted by the Kintetsu Buffaloes of the Japanese Pacific League (see also Japanese baseball leagues). Nomo had a record of 78–46 with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.08 while pitching for five seasons (1990–94) for Kintetsu. Because Japanese baseball clubs own the rights to a player for 10 years, Nomo had to retire from baseball in Japan when he was recruited by the National League (NL) Los Angeles Dodgers.
In his first season, in 1995, Nomo had a record of 13 wins and 6 losses and was named NL Rookie of the Year. The right-hander was also starting pitcher in the All-Star Game for the NL. With a tornado-like windup and an excellent split-finger fastball, Nomo attracted a great deal of attention wherever he pitched in the United States during his first seasons. He was often followed by dozens of Japanese reporters, who covered his exploits in the United States in minute detail. Games in which he started were frequently televised live in Japan, where he achieved the status of national hero. Nomo had another fine year in 1996. With a record of 16 wins and 11 losses and an ERA of 3.19 for the season, on September 16, 1996, he pitched a no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies.
After playing for just over three seasons with Los Angeles, Nomo was traded to the New York Mets of the NL in 1998. In 1999 Nomo played for the Milwaukee Brewers, in 2000 for the American League Detroit Tigers, and in 2001 for the Boston Red Sox. Nomo had respectable seasons for 1998–2001, with an ERA of 4.675 for those years. He pitched a second no-hitter on April 4, 2001, against the Baltimore Orioles. Still, after an injury in 1997, Nomo struggled to regain the dominance he had once shown on the mound. In 2002 Nomo returned to pitch for Los Angeles and compiled a record of 16 wins and 6 losses in his first season back with the Dodgers. He spent two more years in Los Angeles before signing with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for the 2005 season. An elbow injury in 2006 forced Nomo to go to Venezuela and the American minor leagues for rehabilitation. He tried to make a major league comeback in 2008 but was released by the Kansas City Royals after appearing in just three games as a relief pitcher.
In 2014 he became just the third player to be elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.
