Rod Carew, in full Rodney Cline Carew,  (born October 1, 1945, Gatun, Panama), Panamanian professional baseball player who was one of the great hitters of his generation. He retired following the 1985 season after 19 years in the major leagues with a .328 career batting average and 3,053 hits.
Carew began playing baseball as a schoolboy in Panama. In 1962 he went with his mother to New York City, where he played sandlot ball, batting left-handed while throwing right-handed. In 1964 he began playing on minor league teams in the Minnesota Twins organization. His major league debut for the Twins came in 1967; that season he batted .292 and finished with 150 hits in 137 games, earning a place on the American League All-Star squad and the AL Rookie of the Year award.
Carew played second base until 1976 and first base thereafter. During his career, he led the American League in hitting seven times (1969, 1972–75, and 1977–78), his highest average being .388 in 1977; that same year he was named the Most Valuable Player in the American League. His average surpassed .300 in 15 consecutive seasons (1969–83) and .350 in five seasons. During the 1969 season, he stole home seven times—a league record. In 1979 he was traded to the California Angels, where he ended his career in 1985. He became a national hero in Panama and retained Panamanian citizenship.
Carew was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991, his first year of eligibility. In 1992 he became a batting coach for the California Angels, and from 1999 to 2001 he was the batting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers. In 2004 he rejoined the Minnesota Twins in its business department. He also served as an adviser to Major League Baseball on international player development. During his postbaseball career he took an interest in charitable endeavours, particularly the fight against pediatric cancer and muscular dystrophy. In 2016 Carew had a heart and kidney transplant.
