Walter Johnson, in full Walter Perry Johnson, byname the Big Train,  (born Nov. 6, 1887, Humboldt, Kan., U.S.—died Dec. 10, 1946, Washington, D.C.), American professional baseball player who had perhaps the greatest fastball in the history of the game. A right-handed thrower with a sidearm delivery who batted right as well, Johnson pitched for the Washington Senators of the American League (AL) from 1907 through 1927.
Johnson played semiprofessional baseball in Idaho after graduating from high school. Upon his arrival in Washington, D.C., he was immediately hailed as one of the hardest-throwing pitchers in the major leagues. In his fourth season, at age 22, Johnson led the AL in complete games, innings pitched, and strikeouts. His performance improved progressively until in 1913 he won 36 games, posted a 1.14 earned run average, and won the Chalmers Award, the equivalent of today’s Most Valuable Player (MVP). He won a second MVP award in 1924 and also led the Senators to their first World Series title—shutting out the New York Giants over the final 4 innings of the 12-inning seventh game to earn the win.
In 21 seasons he struck out 3,508 batters, a major league record that would stand until 1983, when it was broken by three pitchers: Nolan Ryan, Steve Carlton, and Gaylord Perry. Johnson’s record for shutout victories (110) still stands. His record for games won (417) is second only to that held by Cy Young.
Johnson was nonplaying manager of the Washington club (1929–32) and of the Cleveland Indians (1933–35). A popular player, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936.
