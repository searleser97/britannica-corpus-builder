Jim Palmer, byname of James Alvin Palmer, original name James Alvin Wiesen,  (born Oct. 15, 1945, New York City, N.Y., U.S.), American professional baseball player who won three Cy Young Awards (1973, 1975–76) as the best pitcher in the American League (AL) and who had a lifetime earned-run average (ERA) of 2.86, a 268–152 record, and 2,212 career strikeouts. He played his entire career (1965–84) with the AL’s Baltimore Orioles and in 1966 led the franchise to its first World Series title.
Shortly after his birth, he was adopted by a wealthy couple and given the name James Alvin Wiesen. Following the death of his father when Jim was 9, the family moved to Los Angeles. His mother remarried in 1956, and at age 12 Jim changed his last name to Palmer in honour of his stepfather. Palmer turned down a basketball scholarship to the University of California, Los Angeles, in order to sign with the Orioles in 1963. Because minor league players were eligible for conscription during the Vietnam War, the Orioles’ organization brought him up to the majors as a relief pitcher in 1965. A starter the following year, the right-hander shut out the Los Angeles Dodgers—opposite pitching legend Sandy Koufax—6–0 in game two of the Orioles’ four-game sweep of the World Series. Palmer later gained two more World Series rings (1970, 1983) and played on three other AL champion teams (1969, 1971, 1979).
Palmer, employing a high kick in his pitching delivery, garnered 20 or more victories in each of eight different seasons (1970–73, 1975–78). He also won two ERA titles, posting 2.40 in 1973 and 2.09 in 1975, and his standout ability to field his position led to four career Gold Glove Awards (1976–79). The bane of the six-time all-star, however, was injuries. Palmer was out for most of the 1967 season and for all of the 1968 season, and problems in the early 1980s led to Baltimore releasing Palmer, their all-time winningest pitcher, in May 1984. In 1991 he briefly interrupted his career as a baseball broadcaster to try a comeback but was injured in spring training. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1990.
Also recognized outside the sport for his all-American good looks, Palmer long served as a spokesman and underwear model for Jockey International.
