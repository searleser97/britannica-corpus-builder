Orlando Hernández, in full Orlando Hernández Pedroso, byname El Duque,  (born October 11, 1965, Villa Clara, Cuba), Cuban baseball pitcher who amassed a won-lost record of 129–47, the best winning percentage in the history of the Cuban League. After defecting from Cuba in 1997, he pitched in the major leagues, where he gained a reputation as a “big game” pitcher, posting a 9–3 record and a 2.55 earned run average in 19 play-off appearances between 1998 and 2005.
Hernández was the son of Arnaldo Hernández, an acclaimed pitcher in the Cuban leagues during the 1960s, and, as Orlando’s own pitching talent emerged, he inherited his father’s nickname, “El Duque” (the duke). He pitched for the Havana-based Industriales of the Cuban League and was a member of National Series championship teams in 1992 and 1996. He joined the Cuban national team in 1988 and starred on the gold medal-winning 1992 Olympic team.
In 1995 Hernández’s younger half-brother Liván, who was also a pitcher on the Cuban national team, defected to the United States. Suspecting that Orlando would try to follow his brother, the Cuban government banned him from playing baseball for the rest of his life. He fled Cuba by boat on December 26, 1997, and eventually made his way to the United States, where he signed with the New York Yankees and made his major league debut in 1998.
Hernández’s unique pitching style, which included a distinctive high-leg kick and an array of pitches that came from several different arm angles, made him an immediate success in the major leagues. He helped the Yankees win three consecutive World Series titles (1998–2000) and was named Most Valuable Player of the 1999 American League Championship Series. He signed with the Chicago White Sox in 2005 and was again part of a World Series championship team. After the 2005 season Hernández was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks, who in turn traded him to the New York Mets after only nine starts. Hernández pitched one additional season with the Mets and, after being unable to find employment on a major league team for four years, retired in 2011.
