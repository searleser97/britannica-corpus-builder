Mike Schmidt, byname of Michael Jack Schmidt,  (born September 27, 1949, Dayton, Ohio, U.S.), American professional baseball player, one of the finest all-around third basemen in history. He spent his entire career with the National League Philadelphia Phillies.
Schmidt played college baseball in Ohio and was drafted by the Phillies in 1971. After playing for their minor league team, he was brought up to the major leagues in 1972. He struggled with hitting in his first seasons, but by 1974 he led the league in home runs and began to have some consistency as a batter. In 1980 Schmidt hit 48 home runs, breaking the existing record for home runs in a season by a third baseman. He led the National League in home runs eight times, and, by the conclusion of his 18-year career, he had amassed 548 home runs (then ninth on the all-time list) and had 1,595 runs batted in.
His defensive skills were easily equal to his offense, and he was awarded 10 Gold Gloves (1976–84 and 1986) during his career, more than any other third baseman except Brooks Robinson. During Schmidt’s tenure the Phillies won two National League pennants (1980 and 1983) and a World Series championship (1980). Schmidt was voted Most Valuable Player on three occasions (1980, 1981, and 1986). He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1995. His books included Clearing the Bases: Juiced Players, Monster Salaries, Sham Records, and a Hall of Famer’s Search for the Soul of Baseball (2006; cowritten with Glen Waggoner).
