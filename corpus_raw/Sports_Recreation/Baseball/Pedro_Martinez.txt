Pedro Martínez, in full Pedro Jaime Martínez,  (born October 25, 1971, Manoguayabo, Dominican Republic), professional baseball player who was one of the greatest pitchers of all time.
Martínez began his journey to the major leagues by signing with the National League Los Angeles Dodgers in 1988 and made his major league debut with the Dodgers in 1992. In 1993 he was traded to the Montreal Expos, and the right-handed pitcher used his blazing fastball and ability to pitch inside to compile a record of 55 wins and 33 losses over four years with the club. He won the National League Cy Young Award—the most prestigious annual award given to a pitcher—in 1997.
Martínez signed a six-year contract worth $75 million in 1997 with the Boston Red Sox, which made him the highest-paid player in baseball at the time. For 1998–2004 (he was on the disabled list for much of 2001), he had 117 wins and 37 losses, winning the American League Cy Young Award in 1999 and 2000. In 1999 Martínez led the league in victories (23), earned run average (ERA; 2.07), and strikeouts (313)—known as the Triple Crown of pitching. His 2000 season was arguably even better, as he not only led the league in ERA (1.74) and strikeouts (284) but also had the fewest combined walks and hits per inning pitched (WHIP; 0.737) of all time. (The previous record holder was Walter Johnson, whose 0.780 WHIP came in 1913 at the height of the pitcher-friendly “dead-ball era.”) Martínez became a fan favourite in Boston and was a member of their 2004 World Series championship team.
Martínez became a free agent after the 2004 season and signed a $53 million four-year contract with the New York Mets. In his first season with the Mets, he compiled a 15–8 record with a 2.82 earned run average, but injuries caused him to spend significant portions of subsequent seasons on the disabled list and limited his effectiveness. Still, on September 3, 2007, Martínez became the 15th pitcher (and first Latin American) in major league history to record 3,000 strikeouts. His play continued to decline, and, upon the termination of his contract with the Mets in 2008, there was among major league teams little interest in acquiring Martínez. The Philadelphia Phillies signed Martínez to a one-year contract at the All-Star break of the 2009 season, and he retired at the end of the season after reaching the World Series (a six-game loss to the New York Yankees) with the Phillies. In 2013 the Red Sox hired him as a special assistant to the general manager, and two years later he became a studio analyst for televised baseball broadcasts. Martínez was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015.
During his playing days, Martínez lived in the Dominican Republic during baseball’s off-season and was actively involved in community and charity work there. This community service combined with his on-field success made him, along with Hall of Famer Juan Marichal and Sammy Sosa, one of the most popular sports figures in the Dominican Republic.
