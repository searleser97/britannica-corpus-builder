Maury Wills, byname of Maurice Morning Wills,  (born October 2, 1932, Washington, D.C.), American professional baseball player and manager, who set base-stealing records in his playing career.
Wills was a star football quarterback and baseball pitcher for Cardozo High School (Washington, D.C.) and was signed to a contract by the National League (NL) Brooklyn (later Los Angeles) Dodgers in 1950. He batted both right- and left-handed and threw right-handed. He played for their minor league teams (1951–59) as a second baseman before he was called up to the parent club in 1959, where he played shortstop. In 1962 he batted .299 and set a major league record by stealing 104 bases, which earned him the NL Most Valuable Player Award. Wills was a seven-time All-Star in his years with the Dodgers, and he played a key role in three World Series championships (1959, 1963, and 1965). He was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1967, and in 1969 he joined the expansion Montreal Expos. He was traded back to the Dodgers during the 1969 season and played with them until his retirement in 1972.
Wills led the league in stolen bases in six seasons (1960–65), including his record total in 1962 (which was surpassed in 1974 by Lou Brock’s 118). After his retirement as a player, Wills managed four seasons in the Mexican League during the 1970s, served as base-stealing instructor for five major league clubs in spring training, and did some sports announcing. He was manager of the American League Seattle Mariners (1980–81).
