Earl Weaver, in full Earl Sidney Weaver, bynames the Earl of Baltimore and the Duke of Earl,  (born August 14, 1930, St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.—died January 19, 2013, at sea, Caribbean Sea), American professional baseball player and manager whose career managerial record of 1,480 wins and 1,060 losses is one of the best in major league history.
Weaver managed the Baltimore Orioles for 17 seasons (1968–82; 1985–86), leading them to four American League (AL) titles—three in succession, from 1969 to 1971, and another in 1979—and the World Series championship in 1970. A second baseman during his playing career, Weaver never played in the major leagues but began managing in the minor leagues at age 25. Beginning in 1957, he managed all of Baltimore’s minor league teams before becoming a coach with the Orioles in 1968. Weaver replaced Hank Bauer as manager during the 1968 season and reinvigorated the Baltimore organization. His Orioles teams won 100 or more games during five seasons, and he was thrice named AL Manager of the Year (1973, 1977, and 1979).
In 1982 Weaver retired and became a network television analyst. However, in 1985 he returned to manage the Orioles midway through the season and stayed on for 1986. That year Weaver’s team won 73 games and lost 89, his only losing campaign as a major league manager, and he resigned at the end of the season. Citing his crushing disappointment at losing, Weaver suggested that his tombstone should read “The sorest loser that ever lived.”
Weaver was an early user of computers to analyze data on opposing pitchers. He was also a very aggressive manager who seldom shied away from challenging umpires and was ejected from more than 90 games, making him the third most-ejected manager in baseball history. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1996. Weaver died in 2013 while on a baseball-themed cruise.
