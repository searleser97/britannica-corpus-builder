Eddie Mathews, byname of Edwin Lee Mathews,  (born Oct. 13, 1931, Texarkana, Texas, U.S.—died Feb. 18, 2001, San Diego, Calif.), American professional baseball third baseman who is the only person to have played for the Braves franchise in all three of the cities it has called home: Boston (1952), Milwaukee (1953–65), and Atlanta (1966). Mathews and teammate Hank Aaron provided the Braves with an offensive punch that propelled the team to its 1957 World Series victory.
Mathews grew up in Santa Barbara, Calif. An all-state football and baseball player in high school, he signed with the Boston Braves on his graduation night in 1949. After hitting 25 home runs for Boston as a rookie in 1952, he captured the National League home run title the following year by hitting 47 during the team’s first season in Milwaukee. In August 1954 Mathews famously appeared on the cover of the debut issue of Sports Illustrated.
An integral part of Milwaukee’s World Series win in 1957, Mathews hit a home run in the bottom of the 10th inning of game four against the New York Yankees. He also scored the only run in Milwaukee’s game five victory. Mathews contributed both offensively and defensively in the deciding game, hitting a two-run double to put his team ahead and later making a backhanded stop of a hard grounder to thwart the Yankees’ ninth-inning rally. The Braves returned to the World Series in 1958 but lost to the Yankees in seven games.
Mathews, a left-handed-hitter and an all-star, earned the second home-run crown of his career in 1959 when he led the league with 46. He hit 30 or more home runs in nine straight years (1953–61). Mathews played with the Braves when they moved to Atlanta in 1966 but was traded to the Houston Astros for the 1967 season. On July 14, 1967, he joined an elite group of major leaguers by reaching the 500-home-run mark, and he finished his career with a total of 512 home runs. Mathews spent his final season as a pinch-hitter with the Detroit Tigers and received another championship ring when the team won the 1968 World Series.
The Braves hired Mathews as manager late in 1972, and he posted a career record of 149–161 before being fired during the 1974 season. He was the manager when Aaron hit home run number 715 to break Babe Ruth’s record for most career home runs. Mathews later worked as a scout and as a batting instructor for various teams.
Mathews had a lifetime batting average of .271 and accumulated 2,315 hits and 1,453 runs batted in (RBIs) during his career. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978.
