Hoyt Wilhelm, in full James Hoyt Wilhelm,  (born July 26, 1922, Huntersville, North Carolina, U.S.—died August 23, 2002, Sarasota, Florida), American baseball player who pitched knuckleballs that fluttered over the plate, baffling major league batters for 21 seasons.
Wilhelm served in the U.S. Army during World War II and did not begin his major league career until 1952, as a 29-year-old relief pitcher for the New York Giants. (For many years, it was believed that Wilhelm had been 28 at the start of his rookie season. Upon his death, however, it was revealed that he had been born a year earlier than official baseball records indicated.) Wilhelm’s knuckleball quickly proved to be an asset to the Giants, with whom he won a World Series championship in 1954. Unfortunately, the dancing pitch sometimes baffled his own catchers too, until Paul Richards, the manager of the Baltimore Orioles during the majority of Wilhelm’s tenure with that club (1958–62), designed an oversized catcher’s mitt to handle it.
Altogether, Wilhelm pitched in 1,070 games—a record when he retired at the age of 49—and had an outstanding lifetime 2.52 earned run average, with 143 wins, 122 losses, and 227 saves. He pitched for nine teams but spent most of his years with the Giants, the Orioles, and the Chicago White Sox. In 1985 Wilhelm became the first relief pitcher to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
