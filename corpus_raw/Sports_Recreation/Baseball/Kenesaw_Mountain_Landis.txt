Kenesaw Mountain Landis,  (born Nov. 20, 1866, Millville, Ohio, U.S.—died Nov. 25, 1944, Chicago, Ill.), American federal judge who, as the first commissioner of organized professional baseball, was noted for his uncompromising measures against persons guilty of dishonesty or other conduct he regarded as damaging to the sport.
He was named for a mountain near Atlanta, Ga., where his father, a Union soldier, was wounded during the Civil War. Landis attended the University of Cincinnati and in 1891 graduated from the Union College of Law, Chicago. He practiced law in Chicago until March 1905, when Pres. Theodore Roosevelt appointed him U.S. district judge for the northern district of Illinois. Two years later, Landis won nationwide fame by fining the Standard Oil Company more than $29 million for granting unlawful freight rebates. (The decision was reversed on appeal.) During World War I he presided at sedition trials of Socialist and labour leaders.
In 1915 the Federal League, a “third major league” operating outside the structure of organized professional baseball, brought suit against the American and National leagues. The case came before Landis, who neither granted nor denied the injunction that was requested but withheld his decision until the Federal League had disbanded on terms satisfactory to all three leagues. Following the Black Sox baseball scandal (in which eight Chicago White Sox players were accused of accepting bribes to lose the 1919 World Series), Landis was proposed for the office of commissioner. Replacing the three-man National Baseball Commission, which had failed to deal adequately with the Black Sox problem, Landis took office in January 1920.
Although disliked and even feared for his autocratic methods and patriarchal sternness, the commissioner held office until his death, and none of his decisions ever was reversed. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1944.
