Baltimore Orioles,  American professional baseball team based in Baltimore, Maryland. Playing in the American League (AL), the Orioles won World Series titles in 1966, 1970, and 1983.
The franchise that would become the Orioles was founded in 1894 as a minor league team based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, called the Brewers. The Brewers became a major league team in 1901 when their league—the renamed American League—was elevated to major league status. They moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1902 and became known as the Browns. The St. Louis Browns featured Hall of Famers George Sisler and Bobby Wallace, but the team was not a success, reaching the World Series only once in their 52 years in St. Louis (1944, when they lost to their crosstown rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals). Possibly the most-notable moment in Browns’ history took place in a game against the Detroit Tigers on August 19, 1951, when publicity-savvy owner Bill Veeck sent to the plate 3-foot 7-inch (1.09-metre) Eddie Gaedel, who walked on four straight pitches.
In 1954 the Browns moved to Baltimore and took on the traditional nickname of Baltimore baseball teams, the Orioles. In 1955 the team signed future 15-time All-Star Brooks Robinson, and—with the later additions of Boog Powell, Jim Palmer, Frank Robinson, and manager Earl Weaver—the Orioles entered into the first period of prolonged success in franchise history. Between 1963 and 1983 the club endured only one losing season, and they won eight division titles, six AL pennants, and three World Series. The Orioles drafted Cal Ripken, Jr., in 1978. Ripken went on to set a record for most consecutive games played (2,632) and became arguably the most popular player in the team’s history.
In 1992 the Orioles started playing their home games in Oriole Park at Camden Yards. The baseball-only facility began a trend in the major leagues away from suburban multipurpose stadiums and toward ballparks located near the heart of a city. These new stadiums were meant to be evocative of the idiosyncratic ballparks of baseball’s early years, and they contributed greatly to the record attendance at baseball games by the turn of the 21st century. Partly because of the increased revenue brought to the team by the popularity of Camden Yards and the team’s subsequently larger payroll, the Orioles briefly returned to contention in the mid-1990s, but, following a series of questionable personnel changes, the team fell from baseball’s top ranks in 1998, finishing no higher than third place in their division during the first decade of the 2000s. In 1999 the Orioles traveled to Cuba, where they became the first American baseball team in 40 years to play a game there, and defeated the Cuban national team.
After having finished in last place of the AL East for four consecutive seasons (2008–11), the Orioles experienced a sudden improvement in 2012, adding 24 wins to their 2011 victory total and qualifying for the team’s first play-off appearance in 15 years. Although that team lost in a five-game Division Series, two years later Baltimore won its first division title since 1997 and advanced to the AL Championship Series (a four-game loss to the Kansas City Royals). The team’s resurgence was short-lived, however, and in 2018 the Orioles lost a franchise-record 115 games.
