Dizzy Dean, byname of Jay Hanna Dean,  (born Jan. 16, 1911, Lucas, Ark., U.S.—died  July 17, 1974, Reno, Nev.), American professional baseball player who had a brief but spectacular pitching career with the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League. He was one of the most colourful athletes in the history of organized sports.
In five outstanding seasons (1932–36), Dean, a right-hander, won 120 games, leading the league four times in complete games and four times in strikeouts. Before the 1934 season he predicted that he would win 30 games and that his brother Paul Dee Dean, also a pitcher for the Cardinals, would win 15. That year Dizzy won exactly 30 and Paul 19. Dizzy then announced: “Who won the pennant? Me and Paul. Who’s going to win the [World] Series? Me and Paul.” Each brother defeated the Detroit Tigers twice to give the Cardinals the World Series championship. He retired at age 30, with 150 victories and 83 defeats.
The career of Paul Dean also ended prematurely because of an arm injury suffered in 1936. In 1953 Dizzy was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. As a baseball broadcaster, Dean had a disregard for the niceties of grammar (“He slud into third”) exceeded only by his knowledgeable comment.
