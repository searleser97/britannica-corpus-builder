Japanese baseball leagues,  professional baseball leagues in Japan. Baseball was introduced to Japan in the 1870s by teachers from the United States, and, by the end of the century, it had become a national sport. The first professional leagues were organized in 1936, but the current league structure dates to 1950.
The two main leagues in Japan are the Central League and the Pacific League. Each league is composed of six teams and plays a 144-game schedule beginning in late March and ending in early October. Each major league club has a minor league affiliate, and the 12 minor league teams are divided into two divisions—Eastern and Western—and play an 80-game schedule. The rosters of the major league clubs are replenished with high-school, college, and semiprofessional players by an annual player draft. Each team is allowed to have four import (non-Japanese) players. After the season the champions of the Central and Pacific leagues meet in the best-of-seven Japan Series.
The Japanese Central League comprises the Chūnichi Dragons, Hanshin Tigers, Hiroshima Tōyō Carp, Yomiuri (Tokyo) Giants, Yakult Swallows, and Yokohama BayStars. In the Japanese Pacific League are the Chiba Lotte Marines, Fukuoka Softbank Hawks, Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, Orix Buffaloes, Seibu Lions, and Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
