Pee Wee Reese, byname of Harold Henry Reese,  (born July 23, 1918, Ekron, Ky., U.S.—died Aug. 14, 1999, Louisville, Ky.), American professional baseball player and broadcaster who was the captain of the famous “Boys of Summer” Brooklyn Dodgers teams of the 1950s.
Reese, a shortstop, played his entire 16-year career (1940–58) with the Dodgers, the first 15 in Brooklyn, before he moved with the team to Los Angeles. He missed three seasons (1943–45) as a result of military service. A 10-time All-Star, Reese had a career batting average of only .269, but he often walked and when on base was a threat to steal. Reese was an outstanding defensive player who led the National League in putouts four times, in double plays twice, and in fielding percentage and assists once each.
Reese, who grew up in the segregated South, is also remembered for the close friendship he formed with Dodger teammate Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in the major leagues in the 20th century. After his retirement, Reese worked as a play-by-play announcer with Dizzy Dean on telecasts of major league baseball games. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1984.
