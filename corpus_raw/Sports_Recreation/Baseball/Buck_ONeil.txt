Buck O’Neil, byname of John Jordan O’Neil, Jr.,  (born Nov. 13, 1911, Carrabelle, Fla., U.S.—died Oct. 6, 2006, Kansas City, Mo.), American baseball player who was a player and manager in the Negro leagues.
O’Neil was raised in Sarasota, Fla., and began playing baseball on a semiprofessional level at age 12. He attended Edward Waters College in Jacksonville, Fla., after being turned away from a segregated high school. There he earned a high school diploma and completed two years of college.
In 1937 O’Neil was signed to the Memphis Red Sox in the Negro American League. He debuted as a first baseman for the Kansas City Monarchs in 1938. During his tenure with the Monarchs, O’Neil twice led the Negro American League in batting average, batting .345 in 1940 and .350 in 1946. In 1942 the Red Sox took the Negro American League title and advanced to win the Negro World Series against the Homestead Grays. O’Neil left the team to serve in the navy from 1944 to 1945. He was the team’s manager from 1948 to 1955, during which time the team won four league titles.
In 1956 he was hired as a scout for the Chicago Cubs and helped the team sign future Baseball Hall of Fame players Ernie Banks and Lou Brock. In 1962 the Cubs made O’Neil the first African American coach in major league baseball. His leading role in Ken Burns’s 1994 television documentary Baseball brought him to the attention of new generations of baseball fans. O’Neil served as chairman of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City from its creation in 1990 until his death. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
