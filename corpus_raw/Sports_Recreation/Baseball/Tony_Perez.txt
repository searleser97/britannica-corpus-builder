Tony Pérez, in full Atanasio Pérez Rigal,  (born May 14, 1942, Ciego de Ávila, Cuba), Cuban-born professional baseball player in the United States for 23 years. He played with the Cincinnati Reds, Montreal Expos, and Philadelphia Phillies of the National League (NL) and the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL).
Pérez was signed by Cincinnati in 1960 after baseball scouts watched him play for a factory team in Cuba. He began playing for the Reds’ farm team in 1960 and advanced to the major league team in 1965. Playing both first and third base, Pérez was a key member of the Cincinnati teams during the 1970s that were known as the “Big Red Machine.” Though sometimes overshadowed by other teammates such as Hall of Famers Joe Morgan and Johnny Bench, as well as all-time hits leader Pete Rose, Pérez was known as the ultimate team player. He played in five World Series—four with Cincinnati and one with Philadelphia—and was a member of Cincinnati’s world champion teams in 1975 and 1976. Pérez was selected to the NL all-star team on seven occasions. He was known for his ability to drive in runs; for 11 consecutive seasons between 1967 and 1977, Pérez had at least 90 runs batted in (RBIs), and he was 14th on the list of career RBIs, with 1,652, when he ended his playing career in 1986. His best season was 1970, during which he had a batting average of .317, with 40 home runs and 129 RBIs.
After his retirement in 1986, Pérez was a coach for the Reds and briefly managed the team during the 1993 season. He joined the staff of the Florida Marlins baseball team in 1993. He stepped in as Marlins manager for the majority of the 2001 season (after the incumbent manager was fired early in the season) and later served in the team’s front office; he left the Marlins in 2017. Pérez was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 2000, becoming the second Cuban (after Martín Dihigo) to be enshrined there.
