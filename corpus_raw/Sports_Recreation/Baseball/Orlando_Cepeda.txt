Orlando Cepeda, in full Orlando Manuel Cepeda Pennes, bynames Baby Bull and Cha-Cha,  (born September 17, 1937, Ponce, Puerto Rico), Puerto Rican professional baseball player who became one of the first new stars to emerge when major league baseball arrived on the U.S. West Coast in 1958.
Cepeda grew up surrounded by baseball: his father, Pedro (“Perucho”) Cepeda, was a power-hitting shortstop who was known as the “Babe Ruth of Puerto Rico.” In 1958 Orlando Cepeda debuted with the San Fancisco Giants and was a unanimous selection as the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year. The seven-time All-Star first baseman played for eight seasons with San Francisco, three with the St. Louis Cardinals, and three with the Atlanta Braves before ending his career with brief stints with Oakland Athletics, the Boston Red Sox, and the Kansas City Royals. In 1967, with St. Louis, Cepeda was unanimously selected as the NL Most Valuable Player while leading the Cardinals to the World Series title.
With the kind of numbers Cepeda put up during his 17-year major league career—a .297 batting average and 379 home runs—it seemed he would be a sure bet to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. But after 15 years on the ballot, he was never able to receive the necessary votes for induction, probably owing to the backlash resulting from an off-the-field incident the year after he retired. In 1975 Cepeda was arrested when several pounds of marijuana were discovered in his luggage on his return to Puerto Rico from Colombia, where he had been conducting baseball clinics. After serving 10 months of his five-year sentence at a federal prison in Florida, Cepeda was released early because of good behaviour. In 1987 he returned to the site of his greatest success, San Francisco, where he was hired to work as a community representative. His improved public image led to his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veteran’s Committee in 1999.
