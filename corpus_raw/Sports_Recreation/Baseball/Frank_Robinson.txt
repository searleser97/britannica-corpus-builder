Frank Robinson,  (born August 31, 1935, Beaumont, Texas, U.S—died February 7, 2019, Los Angeles, California), American professional baseball player who became the first Black manager in Major League Baseball.
As a youth, Robinson played sandlot and American Legion Junior League baseball in Oakland, California, and at McClymonds High School, where he also played football and basketball. The right-hander played third base and pitched occasionally. After graduation he was signed by the National League (NL) Cincinnati Reds and played with their minor league teams (third base and outfield) until he joined the parent club in 1956, the year he was awarded Rookie of the Year honours. Robinson won an NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in 1961, and he batted more than .300 in 5 of the 10 years before he was traded to the American League (AL) Baltimore Orioles in 1966. In his first season with Baltimore he won the Triple Crown—leading the league in home runs (49), runs batted in (122), and batting average (.316)—and he was named the 1966 AL MVP, becoming the first to win the award in both leagues. He remained with Baltimore through 1971 and then played with the NL Los Angeles Dodgers (1972) and the AL California Angels (1973–74) and Cleveland Indians (1974–76). With 586 career home runs, Robinson ranked fourth in home runs hit, after Hank Aaron (755), Babe Ruth (714), and Willie Mays (660) when he retired in 1976.
Robinson began managing the Indians in 1975, the first African American to manage a major league team. He had begun his managing career in winter baseball for the Santurce team in the Puerto Rican League in 1968 and had also coached at Baltimore and in the minor leagues for the International League. In 1981 he became manager of the NL San Francisco Giants. In 1984 Robinson returned to the Orioles, working as a coach, as a manager (he was named AL Manager of the Year in 1989), and in the front office for the team’s upper management. He stayed with the Orioles until the end of the 1995 season. In 2000 Robinson was put in charge of discipline as a vice president of Major League Baseball, meting out fines and suspensions in controversial imbroglios. In 2002 he became manager of the Montreal Expos (from 2005 known as the Washington Nationals); he was fired by the franchise in 2006. Robinson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1982.
