Billy Martin, byname of Alfred Manuel Martin,  (born May 16, 1928, Berkeley, Calif., U.S.—died  Dec. 25, 1989, near Fenton, N.Y.), American professional baseball player and manager whose leadership transformed teams on the field, but whose outspokenness and pugnacity made him the centre of controversy.
At the age of 18 Martin began playing baseball in the minor leagues. He batted and threw right-handed and began playing for the American League New York Yankees in 1950, where he played mainly at second base. Not an outstanding player, he was, however, aggressive and a great player in crucial games, such as the 1952–53 World Series games won by the Yankees. After being traded to the Kansas City Athletics (later the Oakland Athletics) in 1957, he played with five different clubs up to 1961.
From 1962 to 1964 Martin was a scout for the American League Minnesota Twins, the last team he played for, and a coach (1965–67). He then managed the Twins to first place in their division (1969) but was fired by the owner for insubordination. Martin then managed the American League Detroit Tigers to second, first, and third place in their division (1971–73) but again was fired for differences with management. Managing the American League Texas Rangers (1973–75), Martin brought the team from last place in 1973 to second place in 1974 but was again fired in mid-season 1975 in a dispute with management over trading policy. He managed the New York Yankees in five separate periods over a number of years, winning the World Series in 1977. Martin’s volatility and frequent contretemps with principal Yankee owner George Steinbrenner resulted in his five firings (the last in 1988). From 1980 to 1982 Martin managed the Oakland Athletics, bringing the team from last place in 1979 to second place in 1980 and to first and second place in 1981 (the season was split because of a players’ strike).
