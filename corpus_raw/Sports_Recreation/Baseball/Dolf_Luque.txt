Dolf Luque, in full Adolfo Domingo Luque Guzman, byname the Pride of Havana or Papá Montero,  (born Aug. 4, 1890, Havana, Cuba—died July 3, 1957, Havana), Cuban professional baseball player and manager who was the first player from Latin America to become a star in the U.S. major leagues.
Luque, a right-handed pitcher, made his major league debut in 1914 with the Boston Braves but spent most of his career in the United States with the Cincinnati Reds from 1918 to 1929.  Luque was the first player born in Latin America to play in a World Series when he pitched for Cincinnati in 1919. His 1923 season, when he recorded 27 wins and 8 losses and posted a 1.93 earned run average (ERA), is considered one of the best pitching performances of all time.
Luque is described as having an explosive temper and a caustic tongue. An incident in 1923 in Cincinnati certainly underscored those personality traits. When players on the New York Giants bench were taunting Luque, he placed his glove and ball on the pitching mound, went into the Giants dugout, and punched the player—Casey Stengel—whom he believed to be the primary instigator.
After leaving Cincinnati, Luque played two years with the Brooklyn Dodgers (1930–31) and four years with the New York Giants (1932–35). During his 20 years in the major leagues, he won 194 games and lost 179. When his major league playing career was over, Luque was a coach for the New York Giants and a title-winning manager in the Mexican League. He was elected to the Mexican Baseball Hall of Fame in Monterrey in 1985.
Although he was an outstanding player in the major leagues, Luque’s most important legacy to baseball is his career in Cuba. He played more than half of his 23 Cuban seasons with Almendares, the team he debuted with in 1914. Luque had 93 wins and 62 losses in official Cuban League games, but he also barnstormed throughout the island, hiring himself out to several sugar mill teams. He managed eight Cuban League championship teams between 1919 and 1947 and was elected to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in Havana in 1958.
