Luis Aparicio, byname Little Louie or Little Looie,  (born April 29, 1934, Maracaibo, Venezuela), Venezuelan baseball player who was known for his outstanding fielding, speed on the base paths, and durability. Aparicio appeared in 2,581 games at shortstop, a record in American professional baseball that stood for more than three decades.
The son of a baseball player in Latin America, Aparicio began his career in 1953 in the Venezuelan League, replacing his father at shortstop for the Maracaibo Gavilanes (“Sparrowhawks”). Signed by the Chicago White Sox, he entered their minor league farm system in 1954 and began playing as a major leaguer in 1956. In that year Aparicio was elected American League (AL) Rookie of the Year, the first player born in Latin America to win the award (see also Latin Americans in Major League Baseball). With second baseman Nellie Fox, Aparicio formed a double-play duo for the White Sox that helped them to the 1959 World Series. In a move that upset both Sox fans and Aparicio, he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles in 1963. In 1966 he helped lead them to a World Series title. He played for the White Sox again in 1968–70, and in 1971 he went to Boston to play for the Red Sox, retiring after the 1973 season.
A popular player, Aparicio appeared in 15 All-Star games. He set American League records for most assists by a shortstop (8,016) and most double plays (1,553; later surpassed), and he led the AL in assists for six consecutive seasons. Aparicio also led the major leagues in stolen bases for nine consecutive years—between 1956 and 1964—and is credited with bringing the stolen base back into favour as an offensive strategy in the American League. His record for games at shortstop was broken by Omar Vizquel in 2008. Aparicio was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1984, the only Venezuelan-born player to achieve the honour.
