Charles Albert Bender, byname Chief,  (born May 5, 1883, Brainerd, Minn., U.S.—died May 22, 1954, Philadelphia, Pa.), American professional baseball player, a right-handed pitcher. He is credited with the invention of the pitch known as the slider.
Bender’s mother was part Ojibwa, and his childhood was spent on a reservation and at schools for Native Americans. Because of this, Bender was given the nickname “Chief”; however, he considered it pejorative and always signed autographs “Charles Bender.”
Between 1903 and 1914 Bender pitched for the Philadelphia Athletics, winning nearly 200 regular games and six World Series games; in 1910 and 1914 he led the American League in winning percentage. In addition to pitching, Bender occasionally played outfield or first base and pinch-hit. Bender joined the short-lived Federal League in 1915, playing for Baltimore, and in 1916 and 1917 he played for the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League. He pitched 3,017 innings during his career, with an earned run average of 2.46. After his career as a player ended, Bender worked for various teams as a scout, manager, and coach. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953.
