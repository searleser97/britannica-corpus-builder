Brooks Robinson, in full Brooks Calbert Robinson, Jr.,  (born May 18, 1937, Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S.), American professional baseball player who in 23 seasons as a third baseman with the Baltimore Orioles of the American League (AL) won the Gold Glove Award 16 times and set career records for a third baseman of 2,870 games played, a .971 fielding average (since broken), 2,697 putouts, 6,205 assists, and participation in 618 double plays. Robinson was at his best in postseason games, having a .986 fielding average and a .303 batting average (.267 regular season). Many consider him baseball’s best defensive third baseman.
Upon graduation from high school, Robinson signed a contract with the Orioles. He became a full-time player on their major league team in 1958, though he spent part of the 1959 season in the minors. In 1964 he posted a career-high .317 batting average, led the AL with 118 runs batted in, and was named the AL’s Most Valuable Player (MVP). Robinson played in four World Series (1966 and 1970, won; 1969 and 1971, lost); he hit .583 in the play-offs preceding the 1970 series and .429 in the series itself, which earned him series MVP honours. As a fielder, he was superb on batted balls that were difficult, often seemingly impossible, to play. He was a player-coach with the Orioles in 1977 and retired thereafter.
After his retirement as a player, he did television commentary for Orioles games (1978–79). A 15-time All-Star, he became a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1983.
