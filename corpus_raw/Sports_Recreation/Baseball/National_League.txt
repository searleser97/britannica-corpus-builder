National League (NL),  oldest existing major-league professional baseball organization in the United States. The league began play in 1876 as the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, replacing the failed National Association of Professional Base Ball Players. The league’s supremacy was challenged by several rival organizations over the years, beginning with the American Association in 1882–91. Of these, only the American League, formed in 1900, survived. Beginning in 1903, the champions of the National and American leagues have engaged in an annual World Series contest to decide the championship of Major League Baseball. The National League consists of 15 teams aligned in three divisions. In the NL East are the Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington (D.C.) Nationals. In the NL Central are the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Brewers, Pittsburgh Pirates, and St. Louis Cardinals. In the NL West are the Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Diego Padres, and San Francisco Giants.
