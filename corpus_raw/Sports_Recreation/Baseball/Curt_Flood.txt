Curt Flood, byname of Curtis Charles Flood,  (born Jan. 18, 1938, Houston, Texas, U.S.—died  Jan. 20, 1997, Los Angeles, Calif.), American professional baseball player whose antitrust litigation challenging the major leagues’ reserve clause was unsuccessful but led ultimately to the clause’s demise.
Flood began playing baseball as a youth and was signed in 1956 by the National League Cincinnati Reds. He was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1958 and played for them through the 1969 season as an outfielder. He batted over .300 in six seasons and had a career average (1956–71) of .293. When he was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies, Flood, with the backing of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), challenged the reserve clause, which gave St. Louis the right to trade him without his permission, as violating federal antitrust laws. (Earlier attempts to overthrow the reserve clause had resulted in U.S. Supreme Court decisions in 1922 and 1953 that held the Sherman Antitrust Act law did not apply to baseball.)
Flood lost his case in 1970 but refiled it in 1971; the decision went against him. Later strike actions by the MLBPA and the consequent establishment of free agency for players with 10 years of service with the same club made the reserve clause inoperative.
After his retirement Flood became a broadcaster for the Oakland Athletics and later worked for the Oakland Department of Sports and Aquatics as commissioner of a sandlot baseball league.
Flood’s autobiographical The Way It Is, recounting his struggle against the reserve clause, appeared in 1971.
