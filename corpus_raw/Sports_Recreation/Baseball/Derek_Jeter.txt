Derek Jeter, in full Derek Sanderson Jeter,  (born June 26, 1974, Pequannock, New Jersey, U.S.), American professional baseball player who, as a shortstop for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB), was selected to multiple American League (AL) All-Star teams and was one of the most popular players of his time.
Jeter grew up in Michigan and started playing Little League baseball when he was about five years old. After an impressive high school baseball record, including a .557 batting average in his junior year, he was drafted as a first-round pick in 1992 by the Yankees. He started at the minor league Class A Tampa Yankees and did poorly, with 21 errors in 58 games. Over the next few years, Jeter improved and was named Most Outstanding Major League Prospect by the South Atlantic League in 1993 and Minor League Player of the Year by Baseball America in 1994.
In 1996 Jeter became the starting shortstop for the Yankees. In his first season he carried a batting average of .314 and had 78 runs batted in (RBIs). He was named AL Rookie of the Year, and the Yankees won the World Series against the Atlanta Braves. In 1998 the Yankees had another World Series victory, this time against the San Diego Padres. The Yankees again beat the Braves in the World Series in 1999, and Jeter acquired a reputation as one of the premier postseason hitters in baseball after posting a combined batting average of .375 in the Yankees’ three play-off series. In 2000 Jeter was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the All-Star Game and the World Series, as the Yankees defeated the New York Mets to become the first team to win three consecutive World Series since 1974.
From 2004 to 2006 Jeter won three consecutive AL Gold Glove awards as the best-fielding shortstop in the league. He also won the AL Hank Aaron Award (for best overall hitter) and the AL Silver Slugger Award (for best offense at a position) in 2006, a season in which he finished second in the balloting for AL MVP. In 2009 Jeter recorded his 2,674th career hit, breaking the record for the most hits by a shortstop in major league history. The Yankees ended the 2009 season with a victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series. On July 9, 2011, Jeter registered his 3,000th career hit, becoming just the 28th player to reach that mark.
His play had fallen off in the 2010 and 2011 seasons, but he rebounded to bat .316 and tally a league-leading 216 hits in 2012. However, his season came to a premature end when he fractured his ankle in game one of the AL Championship Series (ALCS) and missed the remainder of the Yankees’ postseason (which ended with a loss in the ALCS) as well as all but 17 games of the 2013 season. Jeter announced before the 2014 season that it would be his last, and he retired in September of that year with the sixth highest hit total (3,464) in major league history.
Jeter was part of an ownership group that purchased the Miami Marlins in 2017, and he became the franchise’s head of baseball operations. In 2020 he was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, coming just one vote shy of unanimous induction.
