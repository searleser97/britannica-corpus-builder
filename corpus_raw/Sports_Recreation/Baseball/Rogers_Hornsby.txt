Rogers Hornsby, byname the Rajah,  (born April 27, 1896, Winters, Texas, U.S.—died January 5, 1963, Chicago, Illinois), American professional baseball player, generally considered the game’s greatest right-handed hitter. His major league career batting average of .358 is second only to Ty Cobb’s .366.
Hornsby made his major league debut with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1915 at age 19. After playing a number of positions early in his career, in 1920 he moved to second base, which became his primary position for the remainder of his career. Hornsby led the National League (NL) in batting for six consecutive seasons, 1920–25, hitting over .400 in three of those seasons (1922, 1924–25). His 1924 average of .424 was the second highest attained in the major leagues in the 20th century (trailing only Nap Lajoie’s .426 average in 1901). In addition to his outstanding ability to hit for average, Hornsby had great power: during his six-year reign as the NL’s batting champion, he also led the league in slugging percentage each season and in home runs twice (1922, 1925). He captured the League Award (a precursor to the Most Valuable Player award) in 1925. In 1926, as the Cardinals’ playing manager, he led the team to its first World Series victory, a seven-game triumph over the New York Yankees.
The outspoken Hornsby demanded a new contract after the Cardinals’ championship, but he was instead traded to the New York Giants. The following season he was traded again, to the Boston Braves, for whom he again led the league in batting average in 1928. Hornsby was traded for a third time in three years before the 1929 season, to the Chicago Cubs. He won another League Award in his first season with the Cubs, and he batted over .300 in each of his first three seasons in Chicago. His play fell off dramatically in his fouth year with the club, however, and he was released 19 games into the 1932 season. He played sparingly with the Cardinals (1933) and the St. Louis Browns (1933–37) before retiring in 1937.
Hornsby served as a player-manager during select seasons with the Braves (1928) and Cubs (1930–32), as well as during his entire tenure with the Browns. In addition, he was a full-time manager for part of the 1952 season with the Browns and part with the Cincinnati Reds, whom he also managed in 1953. He also served as a scout and coach for a number of major league teams after his playing days ended. Hornsby was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1942.
