Carlton Fisk, in full Carlton Ernest Fisk, byname Pudge,  (born Dec. 26, 1947, Bellows Falls, Vt., U.S.), professional baseball player who played for 24 seasons in the American major leagues between 1969 and 1993.
Fisk was one of the most durable catchers in the history of the game. Playing with the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago White Sox, Fisk caught 2,226 games, a record that stood from 1993 until 2009 (when it was broken by Ivan Rodriguez). He was the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 1972 and was selected to the AL All-Star team 11 times.  Fisk had a career .269 batting average with 2,356 hits and 376 home runs. His most famous home run was a dramatic game-winning homer in the 12th inning of Game Six in the 1975 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Not a one-dimensional player, Fisk was also an accomplished defensive catcher and won the AL Gold Glove award in 1972. An 11-time All Star, Fisk was noted for his leadership on the field and his ability to handle pitchers. He was a fan favourite in both Boston and Chicago, and he was highly respected by both his teammates and opposing players. Fisk was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 2000.
