Chico Carrasquel, byname of Alfonso Carrasquel Colón,  (born Jan. 23, 1928, Caracas, Venez.—died May 26, 2005, Caracas), Venezuelan professional baseball player who in 1951 became the first player born in Latin America to be selected to the American League (AL) All-Star team.
Carrasquel was the third Venezuelan to reach the big leagues when he debuted with the Chicago White Sox in 1950. The first had been his uncle, Alejandro Carrasquel, a pitcher who debuted with the Washington Senators in 1939. Chico Carrasquel took over for the popular Luke Appling, who had been the White Sox shortstop for 20 seasons. Although Chicagoans were at first reluctant to accept Appling’s replacement, Carrasquel’s grace and agility soon won them over, and he was the White Sox regular shortstop for the next six years. Carrasquel led the AL in fielding percentage in 1951, 1953, and 1954 and was named to the AL All-Star team a total of four times. He went on to play for the Cleveland Indians, the Kansas City Athletics, and the Baltimore Orioles before retiring from the American major leagues in 1959. Carrasquel frequently returned home to Venezuela to play winter league baseball, even though the combined summer and winter total of around 200 games per year probably shortened his big league career. His commitment to playing in Venezuela and his enthusiasm for the game made him one of the most popular players of all time in his home country. After Carrasquel retired, he worked with the White Sox in both broadcasting and public relations.
