Reggie Jackson, in full Reginald Martinez Jackson, byname Mr. October,  (born May 18, 1946, Wyncote, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American professional baseball player whose outstanding performance in World Series games earned him the nickname “Mr. October.”
Jackson was encouraged in sports by his father and became a star athlete at Cheltenham High School in Pennsylvania, excelling in track and football as well as baseball. He was a good pitcher as well as a hitter, batting and throwing left-handed. He continued his athletic career at Arizona State University (Tempe), but after two years he became a professional baseball player. He played with American League Kansas City Athletics farm teams (1967–68) and joined the Athletics in 1968 when the team moved to Oakland, California, remaining with the team through the 1975 season. He made his mark as a home-run hitter and an exceptional base runner. He led the league in home runs (1973 and 1975). Playing on the World Series-winning Athletics (1972–74), Jackson in the 1973 World Series batted .310, drove in all three runs as Oakland won the sixth game, and hit a two-run homer in the decisive seventh game.
In 1976 Jackson was traded to the Baltimore Orioles, and in 1977 as a free agent he signed a five-year contract with the New York Yankees for nearly $3 million. He led the league in home runs in 1980. In the final game of the 1977 World Series, he hit three consecutive home runs and drove in five runs as the Yankees won 8–4. In the 1978 World Series he hit .391 and two home runs as New York defended its title. From 1973 he played mainly as a designated hitter (or DH, wherein one bats for the pitcher but holds no fielding position). Jackson finished his career with the California Angels (1982–86; now the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim).
He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1993. His memoir, Becoming Mr. October (with Kevin Baker), was released in 2013.
