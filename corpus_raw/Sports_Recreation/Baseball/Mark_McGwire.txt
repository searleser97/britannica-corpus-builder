Mark McGwire, in full Mark David McGwire, byname Big Mac,  (born October 1, 1963, Pomona, California, U.S.), American professional baseball player, considered one of the most powerful hitters in the history of the game. In 1998 he set a major league record for most home runs in a season (70), breaking Roger Maris’s mark of 61. See Researcher’s Note: Baseball’s problematic single-season home run record.
As a senior in high school, McGwire attracted more attention with his pitching than with his swing. The Montreal Expos drafted him as a pitcher in 1981, but instead he attended the University of Southern California, where he moved to first base, a position he was to maintain in the majors. Selected by the Oakland Athletics in the 1984 draft, McGwire joined the major league club in 1987 and quickly displayed the strength that would become his trademark. His 49 home runs that year set a rookie record (which was broken in 2017) and helped earn him American League Rookie of the Year honours. In 1989 his .343 postseason batting average guided Oakland to the World Series championship. Injuries, however, soon plagued McGwire, and from 1993 to 1995 he missed 242 games. In 1996, after briefly contemplating retirement, he became the 13th player to hit 50 home runs in a single season. The following year he was traded to the National League’s St. Louis Cardinals, for whom he posted 58 homers and with whom he elected to continue playing, ruling out free agency.
Attempts to top Maris’s 37-year-old single-season home run record dominated the 1998 season. McGwire and the Chicago Cubs’ Sammy Sosa thrilled fans with their home run derby, and midway through the year McGwire hit one of the longest homers of his career (545 feet [166 metres]). On September 1 he broke Hack Wilson’s 68-year-old National League record (56 home runs), and six days later he tied Maris’s mark. On September 8 McGwire hit his shortest home run (341 feet) of the year to break the record. The following year he became the second player (Sosa was the first) to hit 60 home runs in two seasons. McGwire held the home run record for only a brief period; the record was broken by Barry Bonds on October 5, 2001. (Bonds hit 73 home runs that year.) McGwire announced his retirement from baseball after the 2001 season. He ended his career with 583 home runs and 1,414 RBIs.
McGwire’s legacy was tainted shortly after his retirement as a result of speculation that he had taken performance-enhancing drugs during his playing days. He thrived during the so-called “steroids era,” when the assumed use of steroids by baseball players cast a pall over many of the batting records set in the 1990s. Additionally, McGwire admitted to taking a then-legal steroid precursor during his home run chase of 1998. In 2005 McGwire and five other active and retired major league players testified at a U.S. congressional hearing on steroids. McGwire’s repeated refusal to answer direct questions about his alleged steroid use damaged his reputation with many baseball fans and brought new scrutiny to his achievements. Despite his 12 All-Star Game appearances and 583 career home runs, he was not elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his initial years of eligibility.
In October 2009 McGwire returned to baseball when he was hired as the Cardinals’ hitting coach. Three months later he admitted to having used steroids intermittently from 1989 through the ’90s, including during his record-setting 1998 season. He became the hitting coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012, and from 2015 to 2018 he was the San Diego Padres’ bench coach.
