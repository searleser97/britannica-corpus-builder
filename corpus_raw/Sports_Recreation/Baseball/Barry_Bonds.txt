Barry Bonds, in full Barry Lamar Bonds,  (born July 24, 1964, Riverside, California, U.S.), American professional baseball player, a great all-around player who broke the major league home run records for both a career (762) and a single season (with 73 home runs in 2001). See Researcher’s Note: Baseball’s problematic single-season home run record.
Bonds was born into a baseball family. His father, Bobby Bonds, was an outfielder for the San Francisco Giants. His cousin was baseball great Reggie Jackson. His godfather was the legendary Willie Mays, who was a teammate of Bobby Bonds. Barry Bonds excelled at baseball from early childhood. The San Francisco Giants drafted him out of high school, but he turned down the contract the team offered him and instead chose to play college baseball for Arizona State University. Bonds was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1985 and joined the Pirates’ major league roster in 1986.
Bonds garnered numerous Gold Glove awards for his play in left field but was best known as an extremely productive hitter. In 2004 he became only the third major leaguer to hit more than 700 home runs in his career, and he became the major league all-time walks leader, surpassing Rickey Henderson. He compiled a career batting average of .300 and was such a dangerous hitter that opposing managers routinely walked him intentionally when men were on base. Bonds was also an excellent base runner, reaching the plateau of 500 career stolen bases in 2003. He was voted the National League’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) seven times (1990, 1992, 1993, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004), the first player in either league to win the award more than three times.
Bonds became a free agent in 1992 and signed with the San Francisco Giants, with whom he continued to have record-breaking seasons. He completed the 2001 season with 73 home runs, breaking Mark McGwire’s 1998 record of 70 home runs on October 5. In 2005 Bond’s personal trainer pleaded guilty to distribution of banned steroids, leading to speculation that Bonds may have used the performance-enhancing drugs; however, Bonds testified before a grand jury in 2003 that he had never knowingly used steroids or received injections from his personal trainer. On August 7, 2007, Bonds hit his 756th home run—off Washington Nationals pitcher Mike Bacsik in San Francisco—to surpass Hank Aaron’s career record. At the end of the season, however, Bonds became a free agent after the Giants elected not to offer him a new contract, and, although he did not officially retire in the following years, his professional baseball career was over. In November 2007 he was indicted on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice for his 2003 grand jury testimony. In April 2011 Bonds was found guilty of obstruction of justice (for which he was later sentenced to 30 days of house arrest, two years of probation, and community service), but the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the perjury charges.
In 2015 Bonds became the hitting coach for the Miami Marlins but was fired after spending one season with the team. He later served as special adviser to the CEO of the Giants.
