Tom Seaver, in full George Thomas Seaver, also called Tom Terrific or the Franchise,  (born November 17, 1944, Fresno, California, U.S.—died August 31, 2020, Calistoga, California), American professional baseball player and one of the game’s dominant pitchers between the late 1960s and early 1980s.
During his 20-year career (1967–86), Seaver, a right-handed pitcher, posted a record of 311 wins and 205 losses with a 2.86 earned run average (ERA). He won more than 20 games in a season five times, led the National League in victories and ERA on three occasions, and won the National League Cy Young Award three times. Seaver also led the National League in strikeouts five times, and his 3,640 career strikeouts rank sixth on the all-time list. His 61 career shutouts put him in a tie for seventh-best (with Nolan Ryan) in the history of major league baseball. Seaver was the National League Rookie of the Year in 1967 and was selected to the All-Star team 12 times.
Seaver was the catalyst in the transformation of the New York Mets franchise from an expansion team with a losing record in its first seven years of existence to World Series champions in 1969. In that season he won 25 games, lost 7, posted a 2.21 ERA, and won the Cy Young Award. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, in 1992.
