Toni Stone, original name Marcenia Lyle,  (born 1921, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.—died November 2, 1996, Alameda, California), American baseball player who, as a member of the Negro American League’s Indianapolis Clowns, was the first woman to ever play professional baseball as a regular on a big-league team.
Stone’s love for the game began when she was a child. At age 10 she played in a league sponsored by a cereal company. At age 15 she began playing with the St. Paul Giants, a men’s semiprofessional team. After graduating from high school, Stone moved to California to live with her sister. She soon began playing centre field for the American Legion team. From there she moved to the San Francisco Sea Lions, where her batting average was .280. Stone then secured a position with the Negro league All Star team. In 1949 she began playing second base for the minor league New Orleans Creoles, and in 1953 she joined the Indianapolis Clowns, playing the same position.
Able to run 100 yards in 11 seconds and maintaining a .243 batting average while with the Clowns, Stone was taunted at times by teammates, once being told, “Go home and fix your husband some biscuits.” She was undeterred, however, and, during an exhibition game in 1953, she hit a single off a fastball pitch delivered by legendary player Satchel Paige. After playing 50 games with the Clowns, Stone was traded to the Kansas City Monarchs, where she retired at the end of the 1954 season.
Stone then worked as a nurse, mainly caring for her husband, Aurelious Alberga (some 40 years her senior), until he died in 1987. In 1991 Stone and other players from the Negro leagues were honoured by the Baseball Hall of Fame, and in 1993 she was inducted into the Women’s Sports Hall of Fame.
