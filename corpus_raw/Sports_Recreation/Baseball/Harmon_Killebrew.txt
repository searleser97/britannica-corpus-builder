Harmon Killebrew, in full Harmon Clayton Killebrew, Jr., byname Killer,  (born June 29, 1936, Payette, Idaho, U.S.—died May 17, 2011, Scottsdale, Ariz.), American professional baseball player who amassed 573 home runs during his 22-year career (1954–75), which ranked him among the greatest home-run hitters in the sport’s history.
Killebrew was signed by the Washington Senators at age 17, and he became an everyday player six years later. He stayed with the team through most of his career, including when it moved to Minnesota and was renamed the Twins in 1961. With 49 home runs and 140 runs batted in (RBIs), Killebrew was named the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1969. He finished out his career with the Kansas City Royals in 1975.
The 13-time all-star hit 40 or more home runs in eight different seasons (1959, 1961–64, 1967, 1969–70)—the second most 40-home-run seasons in major league history behind Babe Ruth’s 11—and led the AL in homers six times. He had a lifetime batting average of .256 with 2,086 hits and 1,584 RBIs. As is the case with many sluggers, he drew a large number of walks (1,559) but also struck out often (1,699 times).
After retiring from baseball, Killebrew owned and operated an insurance company and an automobile dealership, worked in sports broadcasting, and made celebrity appearances. Killebrew was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984.
