Honus Wagner, byname of John Peter Wagner, also called the Flying Dutchman,  (born Feb. 24, 1874, Mansfield [now Carnegie], Pa., U.S.—died Dec. 6, 1955, Carnegie, Pa.), American professional baseball player, one of the first five men elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame (1936). He is generally considered the greatest shortstop in baseball history and is regarded by some as the finest all-around player in the history of the National League (NL).
A right-handed batter and thrower, Wagner had a bulky physique for his era—he stood about 6 feet (1.83 metres) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg)—and had unusually long arms. He was, however, very fast as a base runner and as a defensive player. Wagner played for the short-lived Louisville Colonels franchise from 1897 through 1899, when he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He topped the NL in extra-base hits in his first season in Pittsburgh and posted a league-leading and career-high .381 batting average. Wagner went on to lead the NL in batting average seven more times, and he hit at least .330 in each season between 1899 and 1909. In 1901 he led the Pirates to the first of three consecutive NL pennants, the last of which gave the Pirates a berth in the first World Series, a loss to the Boston Red Sox. Wagner helped the Pirates to the first World Series title in their franchise history in 1909.
He retired in 1917, finishing his 21-year career with a lifetime batting average of .328 and 3,420 hits. Playing at the height of the “dead-ball” era, he never amassed large home run totals (his career high, which he reached twice, was 10), but he was a prodigious power hitter for the time, leading the league in slugging percentage on six occasions. Wagner’s total of 252 triples is the greatest ever attained by an NL player. He also retired with 722 stolen bases, which was the second highest total in major league history at the time. Wagner managed the Pirates briefly in 1917, was a coach on the team from 1933 to 1951, and remained a popular figure in Pittsburgh.
