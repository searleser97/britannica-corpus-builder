Cal Ripken, Jr., in full Calvin Edwin Ripken, Jr., byname Iron Man,  (born Aug. 24, 1960, Havre De Grace, Md., U.S.), American professional baseball player, one of the most durable in professional sports history. On Sept. 6, 1995, Ripken played his 2,131st consecutive game for the American League Baltimore Orioles and thereby broke Lou Gehrig’s major league record of consecutive games played. Gehrig’s record had stood for more than 56 years.
Ripken joined the Orioles’ major league team in 1982 after having spent a few seasons in their minor league system. Ripken’s original position was third base, but he switched to shortstop in 1982. He was named American League Rookie of the Year in that year, when he hit 28 home runs and had 93 runs batted in (RBIs). He holds the record for most career home runs by a shortstop, 345.
Ripken was voted Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1983, when he led the Orioles to a World Series title. He also won the MVP award in 1991. His father, Cal Ripken, Sr., was an Orioles coach for 15 years and briefly managed the team. In 1987 Cal, Sr., became the first father ever to manage two sons in a major league game: Cal, Jr., and Billy, an infielder.
It is the streak of consecutive games played, however, that characterized Ripken’s career. Gehrig’s mark of 2,130 consecutive games played was thought by some baseball experts to be unreachable in modern times. Ripken not only surpassed Gehrig’s record but extended his streak to 2,632 games before he removed himself from the lineup before the final game of the 1998 season, the first time he had sat out a game in almost 18 years. He retired from baseball at the end of the 2001 season. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007.
Ripken’s biography, The Only Way I Know (1997), was written with Mike Bryan.
