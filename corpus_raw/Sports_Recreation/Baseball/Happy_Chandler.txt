Happy Chandler, byname of A.B. Chandler, in full Albert Benjamin Chandler,  (born July 14, 1898, Corydon, Kentucky, U.S.—died June 15, 1991, Versailles, Kentucky), American politician and baseball executive who served in the U.S. Senate (1939–45) and as governor of Kentucky (1935–39, 1955–59) and who brought major changes to baseball as its commissioner (1945–51), notably overseeing the integration of the sport.
Chandler attended Transylvania College, Lexington, Kentucky (A.B., 1921), and, after a year at Harvard Law School, attended the University of Kentucky (LL.B., 1924). Turning to politics after a brief stint in private law practice, he was elected to the Kentucky Senate in 1929 and became his state’s lieutenant governor in 1932 and governor in 1935. He modernized the state’s government and then resigned so that he could be appointed to an unexpired seat in the U.S. Senate; he was elected to a full term in 1942.
After the first baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, died in 1944, the baseball owners chose Chandler to replace him. During the course of his tenure he became noted for his independence. He advocated players’ rights by supporting a new pension plan and a $5,000 minimum salary for major-league players; he suspended the Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher for the 1947 season for “an accumulation of unpleasant incidents…detrimental to baseball”; and he cleared the way for Jackie Robinson to become the first black player in modern major-league history (despite a 15–1 negative vote by club owners). The club owners did not reelect Chandler in 1951.
Paradoxically, Chandler, the backer of Robinson, supported the segregationist Dixiecrats in the 1948 presidential elections. But, after being reelected governor of Kentucky in 1955, he used National Guard troops to enforce school integration. Then, in another turnabout, in 1968 he sought, unsuccessfully, the vice presidential spot on segregationist George Wallace’s team.
Chandler was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982.
