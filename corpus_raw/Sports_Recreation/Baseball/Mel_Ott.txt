Mel Ott, in full Melvin Thomas Ott, also called Master Melvin,  (born March 2, 1909, Gretna, La., U.S.—died Nov. 21, 1958, New Orleans, La.), American professional baseball player, manager, and broadcaster who played his entire 22-year career with the New York Giants (1926–47).
Ott had a unique batting stance with an extremely high and prolonged leg-kick, which helped the slight, 5-foot 9-inch (1.75-metre) outfielder generate power. New York Giants manager John McGraw called him a “natural hitter” when he first saw Ott as a 16-year-old. The left-handed-batting Ott led or tied for the league lead in home runs on six occasions and was the first National League player to hit over 500 home runs. He was selected to the All-Star team 11 times.
The easygoing Ott was extremely popular with fans. In addition to his outstanding playing career, he was the player-manager for the Giants from 1942 to 1947 and the full-time manager in 1948. He was not very successful, never finishing higher than third place in seven seasons. (Rival manager Leo Durocher is famously credited with equating Ott’s geniality with his lack of success, though the pithy “nice guys finish last” was from all indications a sportswriter’s paraphrase.) Ott also managed in the minor leagues after he resigned from the Giants and worked for three seasons as a broadcaster for the Detroit Tigers in the late 1950s. He died at age 49 from injuries suffered in an automobile accident. Ott was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1951.
