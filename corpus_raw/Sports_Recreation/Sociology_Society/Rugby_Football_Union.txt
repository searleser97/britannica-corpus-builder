Rugby Football Union,  governing body of rugby union football (amateur rugby) in England, formed in 1871 to draw up rules for the game first played at Rugby School in 1823. Similar unions were organized during the next few years in Ireland, Wales, Scotland, New Zealand, Australia, France, Canada, South Africa, and the U.S. Among the Unionâ€™s chief activities are conferences, organizing international matches, and educating and training players and officials. Publications include handbooks and guides for coaches. Headquarters are at Twickenham, Middlesex.
