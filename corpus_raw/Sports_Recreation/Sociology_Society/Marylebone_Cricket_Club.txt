Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC),  former governing body of cricket, founded in London in 1787. Marylebone soon became the leading cricket club in England and, eventually, the world authority on laws. The MCC headquarters are at Lordâ€™s Cricket Ground in London. The Cricket Council is now the final arbiter in England, as are boards of control in other countries, with the International Cricket Conference exercising advisory jurisdiction over world cricket affairs.
