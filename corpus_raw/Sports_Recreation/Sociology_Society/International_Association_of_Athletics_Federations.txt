International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), formerly (1912–2001) International Amateur Athletic Federation,  track-and-field organization of national associations of more than 160 countries. It was founded as the International Amateur Athletic Association at Stockholm in 1912. In 1936 the IAAF took over regulation of women’s international track-and-field competition from the Fédération Sportive Féminine International, which had been founded in 1921. The major aims of the IAAF are to establish friendly cooperation among members; eliminate hindrance to participation in international meets on racial, religious, or political grounds; and compile rules and regulations governing competition. The IAAF is the ratifying body for all official world records in track-and-field events. It is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is financed by members’ fees, publication sales, and the promotion of championships. Because of a shift toward professionalism in international athletic competitions, the organization changed its name to International Association of Athletics Federations in 2001. Headquarters, originally in Stockholm (1912–46) and London (1946–93), are now in Monaco.
