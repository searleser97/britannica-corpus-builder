Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, byname R&A,  one of the world’s oldest and most-influential golf organizations, formed in 1754 by 22 “noblemen and gentlemen” at St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland, as the Society of St. Andrews Golfers. It adopted its present name in 1834 by permission of the reigning British monarch, William IV. The R&A played a major role in the early development of golf. Since 1764 its famed Old Course has been played nine holes out and nine holes back, making the now standard 18-hole round.
In the late 19th century the R&A became the sole authority on rules of the game in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. In 1919 it took over management of the Open Championship (British Open) and amateur championship tournaments. It sponsors several international competitions, including the Walker Cup and Curtis Cup matches against U.S. teams. It also maintains close contact with the United States Golf Association and other national federations for purposes of unifying rules of international play.
The R&A made headlines in 2014 when the 260-year-old club elected to accept female members for the first time in its history.
