Reebok International Limited (/ˈriːbɒk/) is a footwear and clothing manufacturer that has been a subsidiary of American management company Authentic Brands Group since August 2021. From 2005 to 2021, the brand was owned by German sporting goods giant Adidas.[4][5][6][7] Reebok produces and distributes fitness, running, and CrossFit sportswear, including clothing and footwear. It is the former official footwear and apparel sponsor for CrossFit and current sponsor for Spartan Race.[8]

The company began expanding from tennis and aerobics shoes to running and basketball throughout the mid to late 1980s, the largest segments of the athletic footwear industry at the time.[23] Fireman bought the English-based parent company in 1984. In addition to its IPO, the brand conquered[promotion?] tennis with the Newport Classic, popularized by Boris Becker and John Mc Enroe, and the Revenge Plus, better known today under its name Reebok Club C.

In 1986, Reebok switched its logo from the Union Jack flag it had since its founding, to the Vector logo - an abstract Union Jack streak across a race track - which mirrored the design of the side flashes of its shoes[24][25] The switch signaled the transition of the company into a performance brand as it began licensing deals with professional athletes in the NBA and NFL.[26]

Reebok designs, manufactures, distributes and sells fitness, running and CrossFit sportswear including clothing and footwear. The clothing line includes t-shirts, hoodies and pants among other items. The brand has also collaborated with other companies to produce fitness equipment and workouts.

The company has released numerous notable styles of footwear including the 1982 introduction of the Reebok Freestyle that was manufactured and marketed for women.[59] In 1984, the shoe accounted for more than half of the Reebok sales.[60] Following the aerobics trend from the 1980s to early 1990s, Reebok also released workout programs called Reebok Step beginning in 1989.[61] The brand also introduced one of their most signature shoes, The Reebok Pump. The footwear collection was released as a men's basketball shoe and the world's first fully adjustable fit controlled with manual air allocation.[62]

The Reebok Ventilator, a line of lightweight athletic shoes with vented side panels, was first introduced in 1990.[63] In 1996, Reebok signed a $50 million endorsement deal with Allen Iverson when he signed with the Philadelphia 76ers.[64][65] Iverson collaborated with Reebok during his contract to create the second-longest running basketball shoe line in history, beginning with the Question shoe in 1996 and ending with Answer XIV.[66]

In 2010, the brand released Reebok Zig, an athletic footwear technology and collection of shoes include zigzag foam soles designed to push athletes forward.[67] The Reebok Nano was released in 2011 and is the first official CrossFit shoe.[68] The company has also partnered up with Les Mills and CrossFit to produce more fitness apparel, footwear, and workouts.[19][69] Reebok released the Z-Series foam, a combination of dense midsole and outsole so the foam is cushioned but not worn-down. The foam debuted on the ZQuick TR with Reebok's new delta logo in 2014.[70]

Reebok Future innovation house has developed a new technology they call Liquid Factory. A robot will extrude liquid polyurethane and "draw" shoe components without the use of traditional shoe molds.[71]
