Nike, Inc. (/ˈnaɪki/ or /ˈnaɪk/)[note 1] is an American multinational corporation that is engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services. The company is headquartered near Beaverton, Oregon, in the Portland metropolitan area.[3] It is the world's largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel and a major manufacturer of sports equipment, with revenue in excess of US$37.4 billion in its fiscal year 2020 (ending May 31, 2020).[4] As of 2020, it employed 76,700 people worldwide.[5] In 2020 the brand alone was valued in excess of $32 billion, making it the most valuable brand among sports businesses.[6] Previously, in 2017, the Nike brand was valued at $29.6 billion.[7] Nike ranked 89th in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[8]

The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as "Blue Ribbon Sports", by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and officially became Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess of victory.[9] Nike markets its products under its own brand, as well as Nike Golf, Nike Pro, Nike+, Air Jordan, Nike Blazers, Air Force 1, Nike Dunk, Air Max, Foamposite, Nike Skateboarding, Nike CR7,[10] and subsidiaries including Jordan Brand and Converse. Nike also owned Bauer Hockey from 1995 to 2008, and previously owned Cole Haan, Umbro, and Hurley International.[11] In addition to manufacturing sportswear and equipment, the company operates retail stores under the Niketown name. Nike sponsors many high-profile athletes and sports teams around the world, with the highly recognized trademarks of "Just Do It" and the Swoosh logo.

Nike produces a wide range of sports equipment and apparel. Their first products were track running shoes. Nike Air Max is a line of shoes first released by Nike, Inc. in 1987. Additional product lines were introduced later, such as Air Huarache, which debuted in 1992. The most recent additions to their line are the Nike 6.0, Nike NYX, and Nike SB shoes, designed for skateboarding. Nike has recently introduced cricket shoes called Air Zoom Yorker, designed to be 30% lighter than their competitors'.[51] In 2008, Nike introduced the Air Jordan XX3, a high-performance basketball shoe designed with the environment in mind.

Nike's range of products include shoes, jerseys, shorts, cleats, baselayers, etc. for sports activities such as association football,[52] basketball, track and field, combat sports, tennis, American football, athletics, golf, ice hockey, and cross training for men, women, and children. Nike also sells shoes for activities such as skateboarding, baseball, cycling, volleyball, wrestling, cheerleading, lacrosse, cricket, aquatic activities, auto racing, and other athletic and recreational uses. Nike recently teamed up with Apple Inc. to produce the Nike+ product that monitors a runner's performance via a radio device in the shoe that links to the iPod nano. While the product generates useful statistics, it has been criticized by researchers who were able to identify users' RFID devices from 60 feet (18 m) away using small, concealable intelligence motes in a wireless sensor network.[53][54]

In 2004, Nike launched the SPARQ Training Program/Division.[55] Some of Nike's newest shoes contain Flywire and Lunarlite Foam to reduce weight.[56] The Air Zoom Vomero running shoe, introduced in 2006 and currently in its 11th generation, featured a combination of groundbreaking innovations including a full-length air cushioned sole,[57] an external heel counter, a crashpad in the heel for shock absorption, and Fit Frame technology for a stable fit.[58]

The Nike Vaporfly first came out in 2017 and their popularity, along with its performance, prompted a new series of running shoes.[59][60] The Vaporfly series has a new technological composition that has revolutionized long-distance running since studies have shown that these shoes can improve run times up to 4.2%.[60] The composition of the sole contains a foamy material, Pebax, that Nike has altered and now calls it ZoomX (which can be found in other Nike products as well). Pebax foam can also be found in airplane insulation and is "squishier, bouncier, and lighter" than foams in typical running shoes.[60] In the middle of the ZoomX foam there is a full-length carbon fiber plate "designed to generate extra spring in every step".[60] At the time of this writing Nike had just released its newest product from the Vaporfly line, the Nike ZoomX Vaporfly NEXT%, which was marketed as "the fastest shoe we’ve ever made" using Nike's "two most innovative technologies, Nike ZoomX foam and VaporWeave material".[61]

The Nike brand, with its distinct V-shaped logo, quickly became regarded as a status symbol[62] in modern urban fashion and hip-hop fashion[63] due to its association with success in sport.[64] Beginning in the 1980s, various items of Nike clothing became staples of mainstream American youth fashion, especially tracksuits, shell suits, baseball caps, Air Jordans, Air Force 1's, and Air Max running shoes[65] with thick, air cushioned rubber soles and contrasting blue, yellow, green, white, or red trim.[66] Limited edition sneakers and prototypes with a regional early release were known as Quickstrikes,[67] and became highly desirable items[68] for teenage members of the sneakerhead subculture.[69]

By the 1990s and 2000s, American and European teenagers[70] associated with the preppy[71] or popular clique[72] began combining these sneakers,[73] leggings, sweatpants, crop tops,[74] and tracksuits with regular casual chic[75] street clothes[76] such as jeans, skirts, leg warmers, slouch socks, and bomber jackets. Particularly popular[citation needed] were the unisex spandex Nike Tempo compression shorts[77] worn for cycling and running, which had a mesh lining, waterproofing, and, later in the 2000s, a zip pocket for a Walkman or MP3 player.[78]

From the late 2000s into the 2010s, Nike Elite basketball socks began to be worn as everyday clothes by hip-hop fans and young children.[79] Originally plain white or black, these socks had special shock absorbing cushioning in the sole[80] plus a moisture wicking upper weave.[81] Later, Nike Elite socks became available in bright colors inspired by throwback basketball uniforms,[82] often with contrasting bold abstract designs, images of celebrities,[83] and freehand digital print[84] to capitalise upon the emerging nostalgia for 1990s fashion.

In 2015, a new self-lacing shoe was introduced. Called the Nike Mag, which are replicas of the shoes featured in Back to the Future Part II, it had a preliminary limited release, only available by auction with all proceeds going to the Michael J. Fox Foundation.[85] This was done again in 2016.[86]

Nike have introduced a premium line, focused more on streetwear than sports wear called NikeLab.[87]

In March 2017, Nike announced its launch of a plus-size clothing line, which will feature new sizes 1X through 3X on more than 200 products.[88] Another significant development at this time was the Chuck Taylor All-Star Modern, an update of the classic basketball sneaker that incorporated the circular knit upper and cushioned foam sole of Nike's Air Jordans.[89]

In June 2015, Nike signed an 8-year deal with the NBA to become the official uniform supplier for the league, beginning with the 2017–18 season.[151] The brand took over for Adidas, who provided the uniforms for the league since 2006.[151] Unlike previous deals, Nike's logo appear on NBA jerseys – a first for the league.[151] The only exception is the Charlotte Hornets, owned by longtime Nike endorser Michael Jordan, which instead uses the Jumpman logo associated with Jordan-related merchandise.[152]
