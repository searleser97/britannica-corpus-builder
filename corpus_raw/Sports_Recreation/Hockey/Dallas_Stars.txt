Dallas Stars,  American professional ice hockey team based in Dallas that plays in the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The franchise has appeared in the Stanley Cup finals five times (1981, 1991, 1999, 2000, and 2020) and has won one championship (1999).
The team began play in 1967 as the Minnesota North Stars and was originally based in Bloomington, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. The North Stars’ inaugural campaign was a moderate success, with the team qualifying for a playoff berth—and winning its first-round series—despite finishing the season with a losing record. The season was also marked by tragedy, as centre Bill Masterton became the first NHL player to die from an injury sustained during a game; he died after hitting his (helmetless) head on the ice during a January 1968 contest. Led by right wing Bill Goldsworthy, the North Stars qualified for the playoffs in four consecutive seasons (1969–70 to 1972–73), but in 1973 the team entered into a six-season streak of losing campaigns. In the late 1970s the team was in dire financial straits and was sold to the owners of another struggling NHL franchise, the Cleveland Barons, in 1978. As part of the unique arrangement, the two teams were merged and continued on as the North Stars.
The North Stars posted a winning record in 1979–80, and the following year the club made its first appearance in the Stanley Cup finals, where it lost to the New York Islanders in five games. Behind the play of right wing Dino Ciccarelli and centre Neal Broten, Minnesota ran off five more seasons between 1981–82 and 1985–86 in which it qualified for the playoffs but failed to advance further than the conference finals. This streak was followed by seven consecutive losing seasons in which the team nevertheless advanced to the postseason on four occasions. The North Stars lost in the first round each time, with one notable exception coming in the 1990–91 postseason. During that playoff run, the 27–39–14 North Stars (which featured Broten and left wing Brian Bellows) eliminated the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues—owners of the two best records in the NHL that season—as well as the defending champion Edmonton Oilers before ultimately losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Stanley Cup finals. Despite Minnesota’s surprising run to the finals, the team was beset by financial difficulties stemming from its long stretch of losing seasons. After the club’s owner, Norm Green, failed to secure a deal to build an arena, he relocated the franchise to Dallas in 1993.
Dropping the “North” from their name, the Stars were a moderate success in the club’s first years in Texas before winning five consecutive division titles between 1996–97 and 2000–01. In 1998–99 centre Mike Modano, the franchise’s all-time leading scorer, and goaltender Ed Belfour led the Stars to the best record in the NHL during the regular season, which Dallas followed by defeating the Buffalo Sabres in a six-game Stanley Cup final to capture the franchise’s first championship. The Stars returned to the Stanley Cup finals the following season but lost to the New Jersey Devils. After missing the postseason in 2001–02, the team rebounded to qualify for the playoffs in each season between 2002–03 and 2007–08, advancing to the conference finals in 2007–08 (a loss to the eventual champion Detroit Red Wings).
The Stars then entered into a postseason-free streak that reached a franchise-record four years in 2011–12. Dallas returned to the playoffs in 2013–14, in which the team lost in the first round. Led by left wing Jamie Benn, the Stars posted the best record in the Western Conference during the 2015–16 season, but the team was upset by the St. Louis Blues in a seven-game second-round postseason series. However, the Stars regressed in 2016–17 as the team fell to fifth place in the divisional standings, which led to an off-season coaching change. Dallas returned to the playoffs in 2018–19, when the team pulled off a first-round upset before being eliminated in the second round. The Stars advanced to the postseason again in 2019–20, where they ran off three series wins to capture the Western Conference title. Dallas was then defeated by the Tampa Bay Lightning in a six-game Stanley Cup finals.
