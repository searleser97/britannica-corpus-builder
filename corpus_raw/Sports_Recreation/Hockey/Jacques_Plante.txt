Jacques Plante, in full Joseph Jacques Omer Plante, byname Jake The Snake,  (born January 17, 1929, Shawinigan Falls, Quebec, Canada—died February 26, 1986, Geneva, Switzerland), innovative French-Canadian hockey player, one of the most successful of all goaltenders in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was an integral member of the powerful Montreal Canadiens team that won a record five successive Stanley Cups (1956–60); following his pioneering example, nearly all subsequent goaltenders wore protective face masks.
While an amateur, Plante developed his unorthodox goaltending style, roaming behind his net to clear pucks from opposing players. His first NHL game, during the 1952 play-offs, was a shutout, and he went on to win 82 shutouts in 837 regular-season games and 15 shutouts in 112 play-off games. Hit by a slap shot in a 1959 game, he received 21 facial stitches. Then, as Montreal’s only goalie, he returned to the ice wearing a face mask. Beginning in 1956 Montreal, with Plante in goal, finished first seven times in eight seasons; altogether as a Canadien he won six Vezina Trophies for the league’s best goalie, including five in a row; in 1962 he won a Hart Trophy for the league’s most valuable player. After the 1962–63 season he played for the New York Rangers, the St. Louis Blues (where he shared his seventh Vezina Trophy), the Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Boston Bruins. During his 18 years in the NHL his goals-against average was only 2.38. Plante also played one season (1974–75), his last in the majors, for the Edmonton Oilers of the World Hockey Association; he recorded 15 wins, including 1 shutout.
