Edmonton Oilers,  Canadian professional ice hockey team based in Edmonton, Alberta, that plays in the Western Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). Although a relatively new team, the Oilers experienced much success, mostly because of Hall of Fame centre Wayne Gretzky, viewed by many as the greatest hockey player of all time. The Oilers have won five Stanley Cups and seven conference championships.
The Oilers were founded in 1972 as one of the original franchises of the World Hockey Association (WHA), a North American professional hockey league that was established as a competitor of the NHL. In 1978 the Oilers acquired Gretzky from the financially struggling Indianapolis Racers, laying the foundation for the Oilers’ dominance in the 1980s. The Oilers were one of four WHA teams that joined the NHL in 1979 when the WHA folded. Edmonton quickly made an impact, qualifying for the play-offs in their first year in the NHL. The Oilers advanced to the Stanley Cup finals in the 1982–83 season behind the play of Gretzky and a stacked team that featured future Hall of Fame members Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Jari Kurri, and Paul Coffey. They won their first Stanley Cup the following season and repeated the feat in the 1984–85 season. Edmonton won back-to-back Stanley Cups again in 1986–87 and 1987–88. At the close of the 1987–88 season, the Oilers shocked the hockey world by trading national icon Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings.
The 1989–90 season saw Messier lead the Oilers to one more Stanley Cup, proving the team could be great without Gretzky. The champion Oilers squad disassembled over the next few seasons, notably with Messier being traded to the New York Rangers in 1991. Edmonton experienced failure mixed with success throughout the 1990s and was unable to reestablish itself as an elite team. In the 2005–06 postseason, the Oilers—who entered the play-offs as the eighth and lowest seed in the Western Conference—won in a series of upsets and advanced to the Stanley Cup finals before losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in a dramatic seventh game. The Oilers then entered into a prolonged period of futility that saw the team finish in either last or second to last place in its division in each season of a play-off drought that extended to a club-record five years in 2010–11. A silver lining of that downturn was that the club earned three consecutive first overall picks in the NHL draft from 2010 to 2012, but the infusion of young talent had little immediate impact on Edmonton, as the team continued its streak of missing the postseason through the 2015–16 season.
The Oilers finally broke out in the 2016–17 season, winning 47 games—the most wins for the franchise since the 1986–87 season—behind the strong play of centre Connor McDavid, the 2015 first overall draft pick. Edmonton’s surprising season ended with a loss in a seven-game second-round postseason series to the Anaheim Ducks. However, the Oilers regressed in 2017–18, finishing the season with a losing record and failing to advance to the play-offs.
