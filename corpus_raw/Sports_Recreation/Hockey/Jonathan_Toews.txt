Jonathan Toews,  (born April 29, 1988, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada), Canadian professional ice hockey player who, with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL), won three Stanley Cup championships (2010, 2013, and 2015).
In 2005 Toews enrolled at the University of North Dakota, where he played centre on the school’s hockey team. He garnered attention for his offensive play, and in the 2006 NHL draft he was selected third overall by the Blackhawks, an “Original Six” team that had struggled in recent years. After his sophomore year at North Dakota, he left college to play professional hockey. During his first season with Chicago (2007–08), he scored 24 goals and was nominated for the Calder Trophy for best rookie in the NHL, an award won by his frequent linemate Patrick Kane; Kane and Toews were intended to be the core of the Blackhawks’s efforts to rebuild. Before the start of the 2008–09 season, Toews was named captain of the Blackhawks. In 2009 he appeared in his first All-Star Game, and he finished the regular season with 34 goals and 35 assists. Chicago made the playoffs for the first time since 2002, but they lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference finals.
In the 2009–10 season Toews and the Blackhawks returned to the playoffs and advanced to the Stanley Cup finals, where they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers. It was the franchise’s first Stanley Cup in 49 years. Toews, who scored 29 points in the postseason, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the playoffs. The following season he scored a career-high 76 points and was selected to his second All-Star Game. In 2012–13 Toews averaged a career-high 1.02 points per game, and the Blackhawks advanced to another appearance in the Stanley Cup finals. Although his postseason statistics were not impressive (three goals and 11 assists in 23 games), his strong defensive play was key to Chicago’s six-game series victory over the Boston Bruins. He tallied an unremarkable 28 goals and 40 assists during the 2013–14 season but again provided clutch play in the postseason as he led the Blackhawks on another deep playoff run that ended with an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Kings in game seven of the Western Conference finals. Toews matched his previous season’s goal tally in 2014–15, but that season ended on a brighter note for Chicago as the Blackhawks defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in a close six-game series to win the third Stanley Cup of Toews’s captaincy.
In 2015–16 he averaged a career-low 0.73 point per game, and the Blackhawks were eliminated in the opening round of the playoffs for the first time in four seasons. Toews led the Blackhawks to the best record in the Western Conference in the following season, but the team had the poorest postseason performance of his captaincy, getting swept in the first round by the Nashville Predators, the worst team in the playoffs. He scored a career-low 20 goals during the 2017–18 season, as the Blackhawks posted a losing record for the first time in Toews’s career, ending the team’s nine-year playoff streak. Toews’ individual play bounced back in 2018–19, as he set a new career high by tallying 81 points (35 goals, 46 assists), but the Blackhawks again failed to qualify for the postseason. In the following season, which was shortened because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Toews scored his 800th career goal and helped the Blackhawks qualify for the play-in round of the postseason, where they defeated the Edmonton Oilers. However, the team lost in the next round. Shortly before the start of the 2020–21 season, Toews announced that he was suffering from an undisclosed illness and was out indefinitely.
In addition to his play in the NHL, Toews also competed on Canada’s national team, which won gold medals at the junior world championships (2006 and 2007) and world championships (2007). At the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, Toews helped Canada win the gold medal, and he was named the best forward of the tournament. He joined an elite group of players, known as the “Triple Gold Club,” who have skated on teams that won a world championship, an Olympic gold medal, and a Stanley Cup. He added a second gold medal as part of the Canadian team that triumphed at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
