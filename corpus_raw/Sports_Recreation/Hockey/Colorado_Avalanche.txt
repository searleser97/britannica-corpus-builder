Colorado Avalanche,  American professional ice hockey team based in Denver that plays in the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Avalanche have won two Stanley Cup championships (1996 and 2001).
The franchise was originally based in Quebec, Canada, and was known as the Quebec Nordiques (French: “Northerners”). The team was a member of the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 to 1979, winning a WHA championship (known as the Avco Cup) in 1977 behind high-scoring forwards Réal Cloutier and Marc Tardif. The Nordiques joined the NHL along with three other WHA franchises when the two leagues merged before the 1979–80 season.
The team quickly adapted to the higher level of play in the NHL, earning the first of seven consecutive playoff berths in its second season in the new league. Led by centre Peter Stastny and left wing Michel Goulet, the Nordiques advanced to the conference finals during the 1981–82 and 1984–85 seasons. In 1987–88, however, the Nordiques began a streak of five straight seasons in which the team finished in last place in its division. During this period Quebec also posted the worst record in the entire NHL three times. The team’s prolonged futility nevertheless produced a series of high draft picks that the Nordiques used to amass a core of young players who helped Quebec return to the playoffs in 1992–93 and to register the best record in the conference in 1994–95. While the team was thriving on the ice, its profitability was hampered by playing in the smallest market in the NHL. After failing to reach an agreement with the Quebec provincial government that would have relieved the team’s debt and funded a new arena, the Nordiques’ owner sold the franchise to a Denver-based entertainment conglomerate, and the team moved to Colorado in the summer of 1995.
The newly renamed Colorado Avalanche (sometimes shortened to “Avs”) surprised the league during the 1995–96 season by trading for superstar goaltender Patrick Roy, who had become disgruntled with his longtime team, the Montreal Canadiens. Roy’s standout play in goal was a perfect defensive complement to high-scoring centres Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg, and the Avalanche easily won another division title. In the postseason the Avs became the first relocated team to win an NHL title in its first season in its new city by sweeping the Florida Panthers in the 1996 Stanley Cup finals. Colorado remained one of the best teams in the Western Conference through the end of the 1990s, reaching the conference finals three times in the four seasons from 1996–97 to 1999–2000. In 2000–01 the Avs won 52 games—the most in franchise history—and captured a second Stanley Cup by defeating the New Jersey Devils in a seven-game final.
The franchise won its NHL-record ninth consecutive division title in 2002–03, but its level of play fell off slightly toward the end of the first decade of the 21st century, as the Avalanche generally posted winning records but failed to have much postseason success. In the 2010s the Avalanche regressed further, as the team entered into its first streak of consecutive years missing the playoffs since the franchise’s relocation to Colorado. The team hired Roy as its new head coach in 2013, and Colorado underwent a rapid improvement during the first campaign under his leadership. Having finished the previous season with the second worst record in the NHL, the Avalanche won a division title in 2013–14, but the team was eliminated in its opening playoff series and returned to the bottom of the divisional standings in 2014–15. In 2017–18 the Avs surprisingly added 21 wins to its previous season’s total to qualify for the playoffs. The team was eliminated in the opening round that season but bettered its performance in 2018–19 by advancing to the second round of the playoffs, where Colorado lost a close seven-game series.
