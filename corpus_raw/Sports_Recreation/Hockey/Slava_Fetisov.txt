Slava Fetisov, byname of Vyacheslav Alexandrovich Fetisov,  (born April 20, 1958, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.), Russian hockey player who was regarded as one of the best defensemen in the history of the sport. As a member of the Soviet Olympic team in the 1980s, he won two gold medals and a silver. He was also a member of seven world championship teams (1978–79, 1981–84, and 1986).
A left-handed shooter, Fetisov was recognized early as an outstanding defenseman. Playing for the CSKA Moscow club, he was named to the Soviet league All-Star team in 1977, at age 19, and four years later began a streak of seven consecutive All-Star appearances. These seasons were highlighted by three Soviet Player of the Year awards (1982, 1986, and 1988) and three Golden Stick awards as Europe’s top player (1984, 1986, and 1990).
Fetisov’s Olympic career began as a member of the team that competed at the 1980 Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York. There the favoured Soviet squad was upset 4–3 by a young American team that they had defeated 10–3 in an exhibition game less than a week before the Games. Fetisov and his teammates settled for silver medals in 1980, but at the 1984 Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina), the Soviet Union swept all seven of its games en route to Fetisov’s first gold medal. At the 1988 Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, his team was slightly less dominant but still gained the gold.
Fetisov’s hard slapshots and physical play made him a revered hero among Soviet hockey fans and a desired talent outside the Soviet Union. He was drafted by North America’s National Hockey League (NHL) in both 1978 and 1983, but he was forbidden by the Soviet government to leave the country. In the mid-1980s he chose to take advantage of the new policy of open speech (glasnost) rather than defect. He publicly feuded with his coach and argued for his right to play in the NHL. His protests led to a one-year suspension from the Central Red Army team. However, in 1989 he was allowed to join the New Jersey Devils, becoming one of the first Soviet athletes to compete professionally in the NHL. Traded to the Detroit Red Wings in 1995, Fetisov achieved his NHL career pinnacle in 1997 when Detroit won its first Stanley Cup championship in more than 40 years.
After the Red Wings won another Stanley Cup in 1998, Fetisov ended his career as a player and accepted a coaching position with the New Jersey Devils. As an assistant coach with the Devils, he won the Stanley Cup in 2000. He later returned to Russia, where he was a member of the Russian parliament’s upper house and president of CSKA Moscow, where he began his hockey career. Fetisov was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2001.
