Buffalo Sabres,  American professional ice hockey team based in Buffalo, New York, that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Sabres have won two conference championships (1975, 1999).
The Sabres began play as an expansion team in 1970. The team made its first postseason appearance in 1972–73 behind the play of “the French Connection,” a line featuring three Quebec-born stars: centre Gilbert Perreault, left wing Rick Martin, and right wing René Robert. The French Connection led Buffalo to a division championship in 1974–75, and the team advanced to the Stanley Cup finals in just its fifth season of existence, where it lost to the defending-champion Philadelphia Flyers. Along with left wing Craig Ramsay, the French Connection helped the Sabres run off four straight second-place divisional finishes between 1975–76 and 1978–79, but the team advanced no farther than the NHL quarterfinals during that span. Buffalo fared slightly better in the early 1980s, with consecutive division titles in 1979–80 and 1980–81 as well as an appearance in the 1980 NHL semifinals.
Led by the play of all-star defenseman Mike Ramsey, the Sabres qualified for the postseason nine times in the 11 seasons from 1981–82 to 1991–92 but were able to win only a single series over the course of those nine play-off appearances. In 1992 the team acquired goaltender Dominik Hašek, who would go on to establish himself as one of the greatest goalies in hockey history during his time with the Sabres. Buffalo hired former Sabres player Lindy Ruff to serve as head coach in 1997, and he guided the team to a conference finals berth in his first season at the helm. In 1998–99 the seventh-seeded (out of eight Eastern Conference teams) Sabres reached the second Stanley Cup finals in franchise history, where they faced the Dallas Stars, owner of the NHL’s best record that season. Buffalo ultimately lost a closely contested series that featured four one-goal decisions, including the Cup-clinching game six, which was won when Dallas’s Brett Hull scored a controversial goal in triple overtime. Most Buffalo players, coaches, and fans maintained that Hull’s skate was illegally in the crease when he scored, but game officials ruled otherwise. The Sabres advanced to the play-offs after the following two seasons and then entered a three-year postseason drought.
Behind the play of standout goaltender Ryan Miller, Buffalo returned to the play-offs in 2005–06 and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals. The Sabres won the Presidents’ Trophy as the team with the NHL’s best regular-season record in 2006–07, again progressing to the conference finals. The team continued to post winning records through the end of the first decade of the 21st century. Buffalo’s moderate success came to a halt in 2012–13 when the team fired Ruff during a middling campaign. During the 2013–14 season, in which Buffalo would eventually finish with the worst record in the NHL, the Sabres traded away Miller in an effort to spur a rebuilding process.
