He also played rugby for Toronto in the Ontario Football Rugby Union (1920) and for the Toronto Argonauts (1921–22). His most sustained professional sport was ice hockey; he played as a defenseman in the National Hockey League (1925–37) with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Chicago Black Hawks, the New York Americans, and the Montreal Maroons and was a member of Stanley Cup winning teams in 1934 (Chicago) and 1935 (Montreal).
Conacher was elected to the Ontario legislature in 1937. During World War II he was recreational director for the Royal Canadian Air Force. He was elected to Parliament in 1949 and 1953. He died of a heart attack after hitting a triple in a softball game between members of Parliament and the parliamentary press gallery. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, posthumously, in 1994.
