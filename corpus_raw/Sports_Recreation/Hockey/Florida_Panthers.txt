Florida Panthers,  American professional ice hockey team based in Sunrise, Florida (near Fort Lauderdale), that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Panthers have won one conference title (1996).
The team was founded in 1993 and took its name from the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). Unlike most expansion teams, the Panthers were immediately competitive, coming within one win of qualifying for the playoffs in each of their first two seasons. In 1995–96 the team, led by the standout goaltending of John Vanbiesbrouck, earned a postseason berth and proceeded to upset two higher seeds in the Eastern Conference en route to the Stanley Cup finals, in which they were swept by the Colorado Avalanche. The Panthers returned to the playoffs the following season but were eliminated in the first round of the postseason.
The team next qualified for the playoffs in 1999–2000, when it once again lost in its opening series. The Panthers then entered into a long postseason drought between 2000–01 and 2010–11 that saw the team finish between third and fifth place in its division over the span. In 2011–12 Florida rebounded to capture the first division title in franchise history, but it lost its opening playoff series to the New Jersey Devils. However, during the following lockout-shortened season, the Panthers posted the worst record in the NHL (15–27–6). Florida rebounded to capture another division title in 2015–16, but the team was upset in the first round of the playoffs. That was a short-lived improvement, as the team subsequently returned to posting middling records and finishing outside of playoff qualification.
