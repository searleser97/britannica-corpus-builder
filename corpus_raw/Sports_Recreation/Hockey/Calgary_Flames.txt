Calgary Flames,  Canadian professional ice hockey team based in Calgary, Alberta, that plays in the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Flames have won three conference titles (1986, 1989, and 2004) and one Stanley Cup championship (1989).
The franchise was originally located in Atlanta, where it was given the nickname “Flames” as a reference to Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman’s burning of the city during the American Civil War. The Flames joined the league in 1972, and they quickly became successful by expansion team standards, qualifying for the postseason in six of their first eight seasons in the NHL. However, the Flames were eliminated in their initial playoff series in each postseason appearance. Despite these strong first seasons, the team’s ownership was mired in financial difficulties, and the franchise was sold to a group of Calgary-based businessmen and relocated to that city in 1980.
The Flames’ winning ways continued in their new home, as they earned postseason berths in each of their first 11 years in Calgary. The team won the first two playoff series in franchise history in the 1980–81 season before being eliminated in the NHL semifinals by the Minnesota North Stars. The next season, the Flames added two future Hall of Famers, right winger Lanny McDonald and defenseman Al MacInnis. In 1985–86 Calgary won its first conference title but lost the Stanley Cup finals in five games to the Montreal Canadiens. The Flames set a team record in 1988–89 by winning 54 games to earn the top playoff seed in their conference. Led by MacInnis and right winger Joe Mullen, the Flames won their second conference title and defeated the Canadiens in six games to capture their first Stanley Cup championship. The team finished atop its division the next season but was upset in the opening round of the postseason by the Los Angeles Kings. That loss began a trend for the Flames that saw them finish in either first or second place in their division four times between 1990–91 and 1994–95 only to lose to a lower-seeded team in their first playoff series.
Calgary missed the postseason from 1996–97 to 2002–03, in spite of the strong play of right wingers Theo Fleury (until 1999) and Jarome Iginla. In 2003–04 the team returned to the playoffs and proceeded to defeat three higher-seeded teams to make an unlikely appearance in the Stanley Cup finals. There the Flames played a thrilling series with the Tampa Bay Lightning in which the final four contests were each decided by a single goal, including the Lightning’s decisive 2–1 victory in game seven. Calgary continued to earn playoff berths from 2005–06 to 2008–09 but once again endured a streak of opening-round playoff eliminations.
Beginning in 2009–10, the Flames failed to qualify for the playoffs in each successive NHL season until 2014–15, when the team added 10 wins to its total from the previous season and won a playoff series for the first time since Calgary’s run to the Stanley Cup final 11 years earlier. However, the next season saw the Flames post a losing record and again miss the playoffs. In 2016–17 Calgary returned to the playoffs but was swept by the Anaheim Ducks in the opening round. The Flames unexpectedly posted the best record in the Western Conference during the 2018–19 regular season but lost their opening playoff series.
