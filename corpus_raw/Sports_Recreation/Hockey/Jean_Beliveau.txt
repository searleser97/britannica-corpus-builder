Jean Béliveau, in full Jean Arthur Béliveau, byname Le Gros Bill,  (born August 31, 1931, Trois-Rivières, Quebec, Canada—died December 2, 2014, Montreal), Canadian professional ice hockey player who was one of the game’s greatest centres, noted for his prolific scoring. He played his entire career (1953–71) with the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL) and won 10 Stanley Cups.
Béliveau began playing hockey in Victoriaville, Quebec, where he grew up, and joined a local league team in 1946. He attracted the attention of the Canadiens while playing in the Quebec Senior League, which they bought in order to obtain his services when he refused their previous overtures. Despite his size—an imposing 6 feet 3 inches (1.9 metres) and 205 pounds (93 kg)—he became known for his speed, agility, and adept puck handling. His 507 career goals stood as a record for centres. Béliveau, who was made team captain in 1961, played in 17 Stanley Cup play-offs, winning in 1956–60, 1965–66, 1968–69, and 1971. His career records of most points scored in the Stanley Cup play-offs (176) and most assists (97) persisted into the 1980s. He was awarded the Art Ross Trophy as leading scorer (1956), the Hart Trophy as most valuable player (1956, 1964), and the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player in the play-offs (1965). He also participated in 13 All-Star Games and was named the league’s All-Star centre six times.
After his retirement as a player, Béliveau became a vice president of the Canadiens. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1972 without the usual three-year waiting period.
