Anatoly Tarasov,  (born Dec. 10, 1918, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.—died June 23, 1995,  Moscow), Russian ice hockey coach whose innovations in Soviet hockey established the country as the dominant force in international competition. Known as the “father of Russian hockey,” he guided the Soviet Union to 3 Olympic gold medals (1964, 1968, and 1972) and 10 world championships (1962–71).
When Tarasov began coaching in the early 1940s, Canada was the premier team in international hockey. Tarasov studied the highly physical Canadian style of play and combined it with the finesse of Russian hockey, creating a unique blend of skill and aggressiveness. In addition, Tarasov developed what became known as “the great Soviet hockey machine,” a system of early recruitment and training of young athletes. His methods proved highly effective as his teams dominated competition, winning 18 national titles and 11 European championships.
At the 1964 Games in Innsbruck, Austria, the Soviet team, led by Tarasov, went undefeated to capture the gold medal. Four years later, at the Olympics in Grenoble, France, the Soviets lost their first game since 1963. However, under the fiery leadership of Tarasov, the team defeated the Canadians 5–0 to win the title. At the 1972 Games in Sapporo, Japan, the Soviets repeated as champions, though controversy surrounded their victory as Canada refused to compete, claiming that the Soviet Union and other European countries used professional athletes.
Tarasov, who coached for some 30 years, retired soon after the 1972 Olympics. He wrote numerous books that detailed his coaching method.
