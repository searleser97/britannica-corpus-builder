New Jersey Devils,  American professional ice hockey team based in Newark, New Jersey. The Devils play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The franchise found little success until the 1990s, when it established itself as one of the NHL’s most dominant teams, winning Stanley Cup titles in 1995, 2000, and 2003.
The franchise was established in 1974 as the Kansas City Scouts, and after two unsuccessful seasons in Kansas City, during which the team posted 27 wins, 110 losses, and 23 ties, the team relocated to Denver, becoming the Colorado Rockies. The team continued to struggle, and in 1982 the franchise was again relocated, this time to New Jersey, and renamed the Devils. (The name, selected through a fan contest, originates from the Jersey Devil, a mythical creature that was said to roam the New Jersey Pine Barrens.) Though the team originally played their home games in New Jersey’s Meadowlands in East Rutherford, it moved to Newark for the start of the 2007–08 season.
When it first moved to New Jersey, the team continued its losing ways, winning only 17 games in each of its first two seasons. In 1987 the team hired as its president Lou Lamoriello, who named himself general manager and helped revitalize the Devils. The team posted its first winning record in the 1987–88 season, when it went 7–0–1 in its final eight games to clinch a play-off birth in its final game by scoring an overtime victory. Riding the momentum, the Devils advanced to the conference finals before losing to the Boston Bruins in seven games.
In 1993 the Devils hired Jacques Lemaire as their coach. He established a defense-oriented strategy with players such as Stephane Richer, Scott Stevens (who captained the team from 1992 to 2004), and Ken Daneyko. Contributing to the Devils’ dominance was goaltender Martin Brodeur, who won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league’s top rookie in 1993–94. That season the Devils reached the conference finals in what is considered one of the NHL’s greatest play-off series, losing the seventh and final game to the cross-river rival New York Rangers in double overtime. In 1994–95, a strike-shortened season, the Devils won their first Stanley Cup. The Devils won successive division championships in 1996–97, 1997–98, and 1998–99 but failed to reach the Stanley Cup finals.
In 1999–2000, behind Patrik Elias, Petr Sykora, Jason Arnott, and Scott Gomez, the Devils once again won the Stanley Cup. The team dominated their division over the next several years, advancing to the Stanley Cup finals in 2000–01 and winning a third title in 2002–03. Although the Devils continued as one of the NHL’s winningest franchises, finishing first or second in the Atlantic Division in each season of the first decade of the 2000s, they failed to return to the Stanley Cup finals that decade. In 2009 Brodeur recorded his 552nd victory to become the all-time winningest goalie in the NHL. In 2009–10 the Devils topped the 40-win plateau for the 13th consecutive season, matching the record set by the Montreal Canadiens from 1971 to 1983. The team’s play fell off the following season, and the Devils’ 40-win and postseason appearance streaks both came to an end at 13. The downturn was short-lived, however, as the Devils won 48 games in 2011–12 and advanced to the Stanley Cup finals, where the team lost to the Los Angeles Kings in a six-game series. However, New Jersey’s ascent was equally brief, and the team finished last in its division in 2012–13 and failed to qualify for the play-offs until 2017–18, an appearance that resulted in a first-round loss.
