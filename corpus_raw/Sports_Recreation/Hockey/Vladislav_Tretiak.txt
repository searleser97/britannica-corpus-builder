Vladislav Tretiak, in full Vladislav Aleksandrovich Tretiak,  (born April 25, 1952, Dmitrovo, Russia, U.S.S.R.), Soviet ice hockey player who was considered one of the greatest goaltenders in the history of the sport. As a member of the Central Red Army team and Soviet national squad, he won 10 world championships (1970–71, 1973–75, 1978–79, and 1981–83) and 3 Olympic gold medals (1972, 1976, and 1984).
Tretiak competed in his first hockey game at age 11 and quickly drew the attention of Soviet hockey officials. At age 15 he was allowed to practice with the Central Red Army club and two years later was added to the team’s roster. From 1969 to 1984 Tretiak was the starting goaltender, compiling a remarkable 1.78 goals-against average in international competition. He led the team to nine European titles (1970, 1973–75, 1978–79, and 1981–83) and six consecutive national championships (1970–76). Tretiak was named Soviet player of the year five times and received three Gold Stick awards as the top European player.
Tretiak’s first Olympic appearance was at the 1972 Games in Sapporo, Japan. The team’s gold-medal performance was marred by Canada’s refusal to compete in the event, claiming that the Soviet Union, as well as other European countries, was using professional athletes. The Soviet team repeated as champions at the 1976 Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, and entered the 1980 Games in Lake Placid, New York, U.S., as the favourites. However, they were upset 4–3 by the American team and had to settle for the silver. In 1984, at the Games in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina), the Soviets went undefeated to reclaim the gold medal.
Tretiak was selected by the Montreal Canadiens in the National Hockey League’s (NHL’s) 1983 entry draft. The Soviet Ice Hockey Federation, however, refused to grant his release, and Tretiak never played in the NHL. He retired from competition in 1984, though he remained involved in the sport, writing books on goaltending and holding instructional camps. In 1990 he became a part-time goaltender coach and consultant for the NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks. In 2006 Tretiak was elected president of the Russian Ice Hockey Federation. He was the first Soviet athlete inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame (1989).
