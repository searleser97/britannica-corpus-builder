Montreal Canadiens,  Canadian professional ice hockey team based in Montreal. The oldest continually operating team in the National Hockey League (NHL), the Canadiens have won more Stanley Cup titles than any other team (24) and are the most successful franchise in league history.
The Canadiens were established in 1909 as one of the founding teams of the National Hockey Association, the forerunner of the NHL (which was formed in 1917). The Canadiens won their first Stanley Cup championship in the 1915–16 season, triumphing in a thrilling five-game series against the Portland (Ore.) Rosebuds of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. Centre Howie Morenz—who is considered by many to have been the greatest hockey player of the pre-World War II era—joined the team in 1923 and led Montreal to Stanley Cup victories in 1924, 1930, and 1931. Before the 1926–27 season, the Canadiens moved into the Montreal Forum, their home stadium for 70 seasons (including 22 Stanley Cup-winning campaigns) before the team’s departure in 1996. After Montreal’s fourth Stanley Cup title, in the 1930–31 season, the Canadiens failed to win the Cup for 12 years, the team’s longest such drought of the century.
In 1942 Montreal signed right wing Maurice (“Rocket”) Richard, a future Hall of Famer who would go on to become the franchise’s career leader in goals scored. Richard teamed with centre Elmer Lach and left wing Toe Blake to form the high-scoring “Punch Line,” and the trio headlined Canadiens squads that won the Stanley Cup in 1944 and 1946. Blake retired in 1948, but he rejoined the team before the 1955–56 season as head coach, and he led the Canadiens into the most dominant period in team history. Blake guided a star-filled lineup that included Richard, his younger brother Henri (“Pocket Rocket”) Richard, Jean Béliveau, Doug Harvey, and Jacques Plante to a record five consecutive Stanley Cups from 1956 to 1960. By the time he retired from coaching in 1968, Blake had coached the Canadiens to three more Stanley Cups, and his teams placed lower than second only once in his 13 years on the bench. Montreal continued to dominate the league in the 1970s, winning six more Stanley Cups in that decade, including four in a row from 1976 to 1979 with teams led by head coach Scotty Bowman and featuring future Hall of Fame players Guy Lafleur, Ken Dryden, and Larry Robinson.
The Canadiens faded slightly in the 1980s, at least by their own incredibly high standards. While the team still qualified for the playoffs in each season of the decade, they won just one Stanley Cup (during the 1985–86 season). The championship team of 1985–86 featured rookie goaltender Patrick Roy, who became the youngest Conn Smythe Trophy winner (awarded to the postseason’s most valuable player) ever that year and would later retire—after finishing his career with the Colorado Avalanche—as the NHL’s winningest goalie of all time. The Canadiens won their 24th Stanley Cup title behind Roy’s netminding in the 1992–93 season.
Montreal’s play fell off for the remainder of the 1990s and into the early 2000s. The Canadiens qualified for the postseason in 7 of the 13 seasons between 1993–94 and 2006–07 but failed to advance farther than the second round of the playoffs during that time span. As the eighth (lowest) seed in the 2009–10 postseason, Montreal upset the top-seeded Washington Capitals in seven games (becoming the first eight-seed to upset a one-seed after trailing a series three games to one). The Canadiens followed that upset with another one by besting the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins in the conference semifinals before ultimately being eliminated by the Philadelphia Flyers in the conference finals. Behind the play of star goalkeeper Carey Price, the Canadiens became one of the top teams in the NHL by the mid-2010s, which included another conference finals appearance in 2014–15. However, the resurgence never reached the heights the franchise was accustomed to and it ended by the 2017–18 season when the Canadiens finished with their worst record since 2000–01 and missed the playoffs.
The Canadiens returned to the postseason following the COVID-19–shortened 2019–20 regular season, where the team lost in the first round. The 2020–21 NHL season was unique in that the still-lingering COVID pandemic forced the league to play its season with four temporary divisions consisting of teams that would only play each other during the regular season and in the first two rounds of the playoffs. One division consisted of the NHL’s seven Canadian teams and—despite having finished the regular season as the lowest-seeded playoff team in its division—Montreal advanced out of the divisional playoffs. The team then upset the Vegas Golden Knights to move on to the Stanley Cup finals, where the Canadiens were defeated by the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games.
