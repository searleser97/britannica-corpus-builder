Minnesota Wild,  American professional ice hockey team based in St. Paul, Minnesota, that plays in the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL).
The Wild joined the NHL in 2000 along with fellow expansion team the Columbus Blue Jackets. Minnesota placed last in its division in each of its first two seasons but qualified for the play-offs in its third year, led by right wing Marian Gaborik. In the first round of the postseason, the Wild dramatically staved off elimination by winning three consecutive one-goal-margin games against the Colorado Avalanche (with the latter two coming in overtime contests). The team won another seven-game series to earn a berth in the conference finals, where the Wild lost to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. However, Minnesota followed its surprising play-off run with two consecutive last-place divisional finishes.
In 2006–07 the Wild earned a second postseason berth, and the team won a division title the following season, but it lost in the opening round of the play-offs in both years. The team continued to post winning records over the following three seasons, yet it was unable to qualify for the play-offs during that span. In 2012–13 Minnesota’s return to the play-offs resulted in a first-round loss. That kicked off a franchise-record six consecutive postseason appearances for the Wild, with the team failing to advance any farther than the second round during the streak.
