Bobby Orr, byname of Robert Gordon Orr,  (born March 20, 1948, Parry Sound, Ontario, Canada), Canadian American professional ice hockey player who was the first defenseman to lead the National Hockey League (NHL) in scoring. He was considered one of the sport’s greatest players.
Orr came to the attention of Boston Bruin scouts when he was 12, and he was signed to a junior amateur contract. He joined the Bruins in 1966, when he had reached the legally required age of 18, and played with them for 10 seasons, during which time he helped the Bruins to the playoffs eight consecutive seasons and to two Stanley cups (1970 and 1972). Orr was a highly decorated player and received more than 16 major awards in his career, including the Norris Trophy as most valuable defenseman (1968–75). In the 1968–69 season he scored 21 goals and made 43 assists (64 points) for a season record for a defenseman. In his career he set seasonal defenseman records for goals (46), assists (102), and points (139). He won the Art Ross Trophy for most points scored (1970 and 1975) and the Hart Trophy for most valuable player (1970–72).
Orr was frequently injured in the course of play. He was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1976, where he served as assistant coach during the 1976–77 season. He retired in 1979, the same year of his induction into the Hockey Hall of Fame. After his retirement as a player, Orr received the Lester Patrick Trophy for outstanding contributions to hockey in the United States. Orr wrote several books, including the memoir Orr: My Story (2013). Orr: My Life in Photos was published in 2018.
