Washington Capitals,  American professional ice hockey team based in Washington, D.C., that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Capitals have won two Eastern Conference championships (1998, 2018) and one Stanley Cup (2018).
Founded in 1974, the Capitals experienced a disastrous inaugural campaign, posting a record of 8–67–5 during the 1974–75 season. The team’s .131 winning percentage that season remains the worst in NHL history. The Capitals improved slightly over the following years, but the team nevertheless finished in either last or second-to-last place in its division in each of the following seven seasons. The “Caps” had their first winning record and playoff berth in the 1982–83 season. Right wing Mike Gartner and defensemen Larry Murphy and Rod Langway led the team to five consecutive second-place divisional finishes between 1983–84 and 1987–88. Washington won its first division title in 1988–89 and appeared in the conference finals in 1989–90, but the Capitals failed to advance any further in the postseason through the mid-1990s.
In 1997–98 the Capitals, led by right wing Peter Bondra and goaltender Olaf Kolzig, won their first conference title and earned a spot in the Stanley Cup finals, which they lost to the Detroit Red Wings. The team posted winning records in four of the five seasons following their finals berth but failed to advance past the first round of the playoffs during that period.
In 2004 the Capitals drafted wing Alex Ovechkin. He led the team to four straight division titles between 2007–08 and 2010–11—including a league-best record in 2009–10—and another division championship in 2012–13, but his Capitals teams were marked by postseason disappointment and failed to advance beyond the second round of the playoffs in six consecutive appearances. The team’s streak of postseason appearances ended in the 2013–14 season, but the Capitals rebounded the following season with a second-place divisional finish. However, Washington continued its recent history of snakebitten postseason runs by losing—after having held a three-games-to-one advantage—a thrilling second-round series to the New York Rangers that saw all seven games decided by one goal.
It appeared that the Capitals might finally break through in 2015–16 when the team set a franchise record with 56 wins and posted the best record in the NHL. However, Washington was eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round of the playoffs in six games, once again suffering one-goal losses throughout the series. The franchise’s prolonged postseason misery continued in 2016–17, as the Capitals were again the most successful regular-season team in the NHL with 55 wins but were once again eliminated by the Penguins in the second round of the playoffs.
The Ovechkin-era Capitals finally broke through in 2017–18. During those playoffs, Washington overcame many of its past postseason demons, coming back from a 2–0 series deficit in the first round, finally defeating the Penguins in the second, and then capturing its first conference title in 20 years (via a tense seven-game series against the Tampa Bay Lightning) to earn a berth in the Stanley Cup finals. The Capitals defeated the Vegas Golden Knights, a franchise in its first year of operation, in five games to win the Stanley Cup. The victory was not only the first championship in the Capitals’ 44-year history but also Washington’s first major professional sports title in more than a quarter-century. Ovechkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the postseason. The Stanley Cup victory did not spell an end to the franchise’s recent history of early postseason flameouts, however: the Capitals won a fourth consecutive division title in 2018–19 but were upset in the first-round playoff series.
