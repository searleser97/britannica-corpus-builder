Vegas Golden Knights,  American professional ice hockey team based in the Las Vegas area that plays in the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team won a conference title in its inaugural season (2018).
The Golden Knights came into existence as an expansion team following a vote of NHL owners in June 2016. One year later the Golden Knights’ roster was assembled with a draft of unprotected players on other NHL teams, and Vegas began play during the 2017–18 season. Expectations were low for the Golden Knights entering the season, despite the franchise having a well-regarded expansion draft (notably goaltender and three-time Stanley Cup winner Marc-Andre Fleury). But the team shocked even the most optimistic observers by posting the fifth best record in the NHL and capturing a division title during the regular season. Vegas then dominated the Western Conference playoffs, losing just three games en route to capturing a conference championship and earning a berth in the Stanley Cup finals. Although oddsmakers had placed the chances of a Golden Knights championship at 500 to 1 at the start of the season, the team stunned the Washington Capitals with a 6–4 victory in the opening game of the finals. Fleury was unable to get the measure of the Capitals after that performance, however, and the Knights lost the finals in five games. Vegas returned to the postseason in 2018–19, but the team was defeated in the first round of the playoffs.
