Bill Sharman, byname of William Walton Sharman,  (born May 25, 1926, Abilene, Texas, U.S.—died October 25, 2013, Redondo Beach, California), American professional basketball player noted for his skills as a free-throw shooter and as a long-range field-goal marksman.
After graduation from the University of Southern California (1950), Sharman played both professional baseball and basketball. In 1955 he left the Brooklyn Dodgers organization to focus on basketball. He first played basketball with the Washington (D.C.) Capitols (1950–51) of the Basketball Association of America. In 10 seasons (1951–61) with the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA), he averaged 17.8 points a game in regular-season play (12,665 points in 710 games). The Celtics won the NBA title in four of Sharman’s last five seasons. He established NBA career records for free-throw shooting average in regular seasons (.883, with 3,143 successful throws in 3,557 attempts; record later broken) and play-off series (.911, with 370 of 406). In the play-offs following the 1958–59 season, he set another NBA standard with 56 consecutive successful free-throw attempts. Sharman was named to the NBA All-Star first team in three successive seasons (1956–59) and to the second team in 1953, 1955, and 1960.
After his retirement as a player, Sharman became a coach, directing the Cleveland Pipers to the American Basketball League (ABL) title in 1961–62, the Utah Stars to the American Basketball Association (ABA) title in 1970–71, and the Los Angeles Lakers to the NBA title in 1971–72. He was named NBA coach of the year in 1972. In that 1971–72 season, the Lakers won an NBA-record 33 straight games. He retired as a coach in 1976 and became general manager of the Lakers, a position he held until 1982. He served as the Lakers’ club president from 1982 to 1986 and subsequently was a special adviser to the franchise. Sharman was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player (1975) and a coach (2004), becoming only the third person in basketball history to be so honoured. In 1996 the NBA named him one of the 50 greatest players of all time.
