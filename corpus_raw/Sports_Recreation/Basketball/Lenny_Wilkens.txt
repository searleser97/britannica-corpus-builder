Lenny Wilkens, byname of Leonard Randolph Wilkens,  (born Oct. 28, 1937, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.), American professional basketball player and coach who is considered one of the game’s most accomplished playmaking guards and who won 1,332 games, the second most in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA), behind only Don Nelson. His total of 1,155 losses as a coach is an NBA record.
At Providence College the slender left-handed Wilkens made good use of his calm, patient nature to become adept at both dishing out assists and playing heady defense. By the time the St. Louis Hawks drafted him in 1960, Wilkens was ready to step right into the starting lineup. Over his 15-year career with the Hawks, Seattle Supersonics, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Portland Trail Blazers, Wilkens, always a skilled floor general, also developed into a prolific scorer, compiling 17,772 career points, along with 7,211 assists. A nine-time all-star, he ranks among the NBA’s elite in those categories, as well as in free throws and minutes played.
Before ending his playing career, Wilkens took on the role of player-coach, first with the Supersonics (1969–70 to 1971–72) and then with the Trail Blazers (1974–75 to 1975–76). As a full-time coach, he guided the Supersonics (1977–78 to 1984–85), winning a championship in 1978–79; the Cavaliers (1986–87 to 1992–93), who despite several strong seasons could never advance beyond the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the play-offs; the Atlanta Hawks (1993–94 to 1999–2000); the Toronto Raptors (2000–01 to 2002–03); and the New York Knicks (2004–05).
He also coached the U.S. men’s basketball team to a gold medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Ga. Moreover, Wilkens was vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (1961–69), served as president of the NBA Coaches Association, held a number of jobs in the Supersonics’ front office, and served as a game analyst on basketball television broadcasts. He also wrote an autobiography, Unguarded: My Forty Years Surviving in the NBA (2001). Wilkens was named one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history in 1996, and he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a player in 1989 and as a coach in 1998.
