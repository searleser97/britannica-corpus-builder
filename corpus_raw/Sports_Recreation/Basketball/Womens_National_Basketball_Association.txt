Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA),  American women’s professional basketball league that began play in 1997.
The WNBA was created by the National Basketball Association (NBA) Board of Governors as a women’s analogue to the NBA. Each of the first eight WNBA franchises was located in a city that was also home to an NBA team, often with nicknames and uniform colours that were evocative of their men’s counterparts. The NBA owned each of the franchises until 2002, when it began allowing the sale of franchises to ownership groups in cities that did not have NBA teams and to groups in NBA cities that were unaffiliated with those NBA teams.
The first four WNBA titles were won by the Houston Comets, with teams that featured two of the league’s first superstars in Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes. Helped by the dissolution of the rival American Basketball League in 1999, the WNBA grew in the early years of the 21st century to become the most successful American women’s professional sports league ever, helped along by the popularity of outstanding players such as Rebecca Lobo, Lisa Leslie, and Lauren Jackson.
The WNBA is divided into two divisions that each consist of six teams and are aligned as follows:
