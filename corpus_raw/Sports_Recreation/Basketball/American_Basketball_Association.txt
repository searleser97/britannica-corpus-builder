American Basketball Association (ABA),  former professional basketball league formed in the United States in 1967 to rival the older National Basketball Association (NBA). George Mikan, a former star player in the NBA, was the ABA’s first commissioner. The ABA fielded 11 teams in its first season and quickly earned a loyal following with its wide-open style of play. The league introduced a number of rule changes, most notably the three-point shot and a red, white, and blue ball. The quality of play was equal to that of the NBA, and the ABA nurtured the careers of Julius (“Dr. J”) Erving, Connie Hawkins, and David Thompson.
A proposed merger between the ABA and the NBA was met with a class action suit filed by ABA players, who alleged violations of antitrust laws. The settlement in 1976 resulted in the dissolution of the ABA, with four ABA teams—the New York Nets, the Denver Nuggets, the San Antonio Spurs, and the Indiana Pacers—absorbed into the NBA, a dispersal draft of certain ABA players by NBA teams, and the remaining players granted permission to act as free agents.
