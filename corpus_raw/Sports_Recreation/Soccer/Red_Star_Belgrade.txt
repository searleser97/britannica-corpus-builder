Red Star Belgrade, byname of Fudbalski Klub Crvena Zvezda (Serbian: “Football Club Red Star”), also known as Red Star,  Serbian professional football (soccer) team based in Belgrade. Best known simply as Red Star, the club is the most successful team in the history of Serbian football, with more than two dozen national titles (including those won when Serbia was part of federated Yugoslavia and later of the amalgamated state of Serbia and Montenegro).
Red Star was founded in 1945. After winning the regional Serbian championship in 1946, the club earned an opportunity to play in the Yugoslavian national championship. It won that competition for the first time in 1951 and twice won it three times in a row (1968–70 and 1990–92). Red Star won the Yugoslav Cup 12 times. Moreover, the club triumphed twice (1958, 1968) in the Mitropa Cup (a tournament for clubs from central Europe that ended in 1992).
In broader European competition, the club’s greatest victory came in 1991, when Red Star beat Olympique de Marseille to win the European Cup (now the Champions League), becoming only the second team from eastern Europe (after Romania’s Steaua Bucharest) to do so. That same year Red Star won the Intercontinental Cup (contested by the club champions of Europe and South America), beating the Chilean team Colo Colo 3–0.
The team plays in Rajko Mitić Stadium (named for a former Red Star great), which opened in 1963 and is nicknamed “the Marakana,” after Rio de Janiero’s famed Maracanã Stadium. Red Star is notable for producing many footballers who later starred abroad for foreign clubs. Among the most notable of those players are defender Siniša Mihajlović, midfielder Dejan Stanković, and defender Nemanja Vidić.
