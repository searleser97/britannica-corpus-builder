Lothar Matthäus, in full Lothar Herbert Matthäus,  (born March 21, 1961, Erlangen, West Germany), German football (soccer) player who was the only outfield player in the world to compete in five World Cup finals—1982, 1986, 1990 (when he captained the German side to the title), 1994, and 1998. He was also a member of the 1980 European Championship team.
Matthäus made his professional debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1979 and his international debut only a year later. In 1984 he moved to Bayern Munich for the first of two tours (1984–88, 1992–2000) with the legendary team of the German Bundesliga. With Bayern he won five German league championships (1985, 1987, 1994, 1997, and 1999) as well as the UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) Cup in 1996 and the West German and German cups in 1986 and 1998. He played for Inter Milan from 1988 to 1992, capturing the Italian league title in 1989 and the UEFA Cup in 1991. Playing in both the midfield and defense, Matthäus was respected for his fitness, intelligence, and powerful shot. He was named European Footballer of the Year in 1990 and World Footballer of the Year in 1990 and 1991. He closed out his club career with the New York–New Jersey MetroStars in the United States in the summer of 2000. That year he also retired from international play, having made 150 appearances.
Matthäus subsequently embarked on a coaching career. However, he had limited success, and his tenures with a series of clubs were brief.
