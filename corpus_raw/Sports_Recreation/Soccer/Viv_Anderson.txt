Viv Anderson, byname of Vivian Anderson,  (born July 29, 1956, Nottingham, England), professional football (soccer) player and the first person of African descent (his parents were from the West Indies) to play for England’s national football team (1978). Anderson, 1.85 metres (6 feet 1 inch) tall, was known as “Spider” for his long legs and his ability as a defender in cleanly winning balls in skirmishes.
Anderson began his professional football career in 1974 with Nottingham Forest, where, as a fullback, he quickly showed his talent for winning the ball both on the ground and in the air and for supporting in attack. He was a fixture on the talented Forest teams that won the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1979 and 1980. In his career, Anderson earned 30 “caps” for playing on England’s national team.
Following 10 outstanding years with Forest, Anderson played for Arsenal (1984–87), Manchester United (1987–91), and Sheffield Wednesday (1991–93); he was a player/manager for Barnsley (1993–94) and a player/assistant coach for Middlesbrough (1994–2001). He was awarded the Member of the British Empire (MBE) in 1999, and in 2004 he was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame.
