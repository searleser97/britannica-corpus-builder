English Football League (EFL),  English professional football (soccer) organization. The league was formed in 1888, largely through the efforts of William McGregor, known afterward as the “father of the league.” Twelve of the strongest professional clubs of the time joined in the league, and the first season’s championship was won by Preston North End. In 1892 a second division was formed, and the first division increased to 16 clubs. Soon after, the league adopted the practice of promoting the first two clubs in the second division at the end of each season into the places of the last two clubs of the first division, which were relegated to the second division. A third division was added in 1920 and reorganized to form a fourth in 1958; a four-up, four-down promotion and relegation system between these two divisions was set up at the same time. Demand for revenues from television and other resources led First Division clubs to break with the league and form the Premier League in 1992. The EFL Championship (first division) maintains a three-up, three-down promotion and relegation agreement with the Premier League. The EFL includes 72 clubs, and its headquarters are in London.
The EFL’s system of divisions with annual promotions and demotions was copied by other leagues throughout Europe.
