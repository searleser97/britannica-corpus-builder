AC Milan, in full Associazione Calcio Milan, also called Rossoneri (Italian: “Red and Blacks”),  Italian professional football (soccer) club based in Milan. AC Milan is nicknamed the Rossoneri (“Red and Blacks”) because of the team’s distinctive red-and-black striped jerseys. The winner of 18 Serie A (Italy’s top football division) league championships, the club is also one of the world’s most successful teams in international club competitions.
The Milan Football and Cricket Club was formed in December 1899 with an Englishman, Alfred Ormonde Edwards, as its first president. The club survived a split in 1908, with some players forming what would become AC Milan’s fiercest rival, Inter Milan. AC Milan played at five different stadiums before moving to the San Siro in 1926. That stadium, heavily redeveloped for the 1990 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup tournament, now holds more than 80,000 spectators. Since 1946 AC Milan has shared the ground with Inter. The stadium was renamed the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium in 1980 in honour of the great Italian forward who played briefly for AC Milan but spent most of his career with Inter.
Matches between Inter and AC Milan are known as the “Derby della Madonnina” after the statue of the Virgin Mary that surmounts the nearby Milan Cathedral. The rivalry between the two groups of fans is intense. Occasionally, this rivalry spills over into hooliganism and violence. In a semifinal match of the 2004–05 Champions League between the two teams, AC Milan was leading 1–0 when bottles, coins, and flares were thrown onto the pitch by Inter fans. One of the flares hit AC Milan’s goalkeeper, Dida, causing injury, and the game had to be discontinued.
AC Milan won its first major international trophy, the European Cup, in 1963. Six more European Cup (now known as the Champions League) titles would follow. The latest came in 2007, when two goals from Filippo Inzaghi helped Milan beat Liverpool FC 2–1 in the final. AC Milan has also won five European Super Cups (1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007), two European Cup Winners’ Cups (1968, 1973), and three Intercontinental Cups (1969, 1989, 1990). In 2007, when it won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, AC Milan became the most successful European club in the history of international competion, with 18 major trophies to its credit.
AC Milan is unusual in that it has retired two jersey numbers in memory of former long-serving star players. The number 6 shirt is no longer worn, so as to honour the tough-tackling defender Franco Baresi, who played for Milan from 1978 to 1997, and the number 3 shirt is no longer worn, in deference to defender Paolo Maldini, who played more than 900 matches for the club between 1985 and 2009. Other notable footballers who have played for Milan include Marco van Basten, George Weah, and Kaká. The club was owned by Italian businessman and politician Silvio Berlusconi from 1986 to 2017.
