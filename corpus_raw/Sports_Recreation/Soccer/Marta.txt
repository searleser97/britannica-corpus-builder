Marta, byname of Marta Vieira da Silva,  (born February 19, 1986, Dois Riachos, Brazil), Brazilian athlete who is widely considered the greatest female football (soccer) player of all time. Marta was a six-time winner of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year award (2006–10 and 2018).
Prevented from playing football with her male peers because of her gender, Marta began honing her skills as a young girl by kicking abandoned deflated footballs and improvised balls made up of wadded grocery bags through the streets of her small town. She eventually joined a local boys’ junior team, for which she was playing when she was discovered at age 14 by a scout from Vasco da Gama, a renowned men’s football club in Rio de Janeiro that was looking to begin a women’s team. Thereafter she played on women’s teams, beginning with Vasco, until it folded a few years later, and then with Santa Cruz in Brazil before joining Sweden’s Umeå IK in 2004.
Marta first gained widespread notice during her time with Umeå, which she led to the 2004 Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Women’s Cup (now known as the Women’s Champions League) title and helped to reach the finals in that competition in 2007 and 2008. Marta also helped Umeå capture four consecutive Damallsvenskan (Sweden’s highest level of women’s domestic football) championships between 2005 and 2008, as well as a Swedish Cup title in 2007. Marta scored a remarkable 111 goals in 103 league games during her five seasons with Umeå as she led the league in goals over three seasons (2004, 2005, and 2008). She left Europe in 2009 to sign with the Los Angeles Sol of Women’s Professional Soccer (WPS). Marta was named WPS Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2009, but the struggling Los Angeles franchise folded, and she moved within the WPS to join the FC Gold Pride of Santa Clara, California. She led the Gold Pride to a WPS title (taking home a second league MVP award) in 2010, and she won a second WPS championship in 2011 as a member of the Western New York Flash. During the WPS offseasons in 2009 and 2010, Marta played with Santos FC in her home country. When the WPS suspended operations in 2012, Marta returned to Sweden as a member of Tyresö FF. She moved to FC Rosengård in 2014. Three years later she joined the Orlando Pride of the United States’ National Women’s Soccer League.
Marta established herself as the greatest female footballer of her generation primarily through her feats as a member of the Brazilian women’s national team. She made her international football debut in 2002 as a member of Brazil’s under-20 Women’s World Cup team. The following year she joined the senior national squad and scored three goals at the 2003 FIFA Women’s World Cup, where Brazil was eliminated in the quarterfinals. At the 2007 Women’s World Cup, she won the Golden Boot by scoring seven goals during the tournament and led Brazil to a second-place finish. In 2011 Marta increased her career Cup goal tally to 14, which tied Germany’s Birgit Prinz for most Women’s World Cup goals of all time, but the Brazilian national team was again eliminated in the Cup quarterfinals. She scored her 15th Cup goal in 2015 on a penalty kick against South Korea—the same scoring situation and opponent as for her first World Cup goal—to set a new record for Women’s World Cup scoring. At the 2019 Women’s World Cup, she scored her 17th World Cup goal, making her the all-time World Cup goal scorer in both men’s and women’s competitions (a record formerly held by Germany’s Miroslav Klose), but Brazil was eliminated in that event’s round of 16.
Marta also helped Brazil capture silver medals at the 2004 Athens and 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
