Salif Keita,  (born Dec. 6, 1942, Bamako, Mali), Malian football (soccer) player and the first recipient of the African Player of the Year award in 1970. Keita symbolized independent Africa’s football passion and prowess.
The son of a truck driver, Salif Keita played school football before joining a professional team, Real Bamako, at age 15. Keita had a superb career but failed to win an African title. He was a losing finalist with Stade Malien and Real Bamako in the Champions Cup in 1965 and 1966, respectively, and with Mali in the All-African Games in 1965 and the African Cup of Nations in 1972.
In September 1967 Keita began his professional career in France. A fast and elegant forward with excellent scoring ability, he joined fellow Africans Rachid Mekhloufi (Algeria) and Frederic N’Doumbé (Cameroon) at Saint-Étienne. During his five years with Saint-Étienne, the team won three league titles (1968–70) and two French Cups (1968, 1970), and Keita was recognized as Africa’s premier footballer. He left for Olympique de Marseille late in 1972, but his finesse style of play clashed with the physical style demanded by his new team’s coach. Unwilling to give in to the club’s order that he become a French citizen (to make room for another foreigner), Keita signed a remunerative contract with Spanish club Valencia. After three seasons in Spain (1973–76), Keita played three seasons with Sporting Clube de Portugal and then ended his career in 1980 after a season with the New England Tea Men of the North American Soccer League.
