Oliver Kahn, in full Oliver Rolf Kahn, byname King Kahn,  (born June 15, 1969, Karlsruhe, West Germany [now Germany]), German football (soccer) player who is considered one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time. He was named world goalkeeper of the year on three occasions (1999, 2001, and 2002).
Kahn began playing as a six-year-old with his local football club, and he made his upper-division debut with Karlsruher SC in 1987. He progressed so well that in 1994 Bayern Munich signed him in a $2.5 million transfer—a record amount at the time for a German goalkeeper. Kahn received guidance from Bayern’s goalkeeper coach, renowned ex-keeper Sepp Maier, and in Kahn’s 14 years with the team they collected eight Bundesliga championships and six German Cups. In addition, he led Bayern to wins in the 1996 Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Cup and the 2001 UEFA Champions League.
Despite his early club success, Kahn did not make either the German youth or intermediate-level national teams. He played his first international match in 1995 and was Germany’s second-string goalkeeper at both the 1996 European Championship (which Germany won) and the 1998 World Cup. The 2002 World Cup gave Kahn his first real opportunity on the world stage. He suffered a humiliating experience in the qualifying competition when he conceded five goals to England, but he recovered to post five shutouts in the tournament. However, in the final against Brazil, he mishandled a shot that led to Brazil’s first goal, which helped cost Germany the trophy. Nevertheless, he was awarded the Lev Yashin Award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament, and after the game he became the first goalkeeper to receive the Golden Ball as the tournament’s best player.
Kahn retired from professional football in 2008 and launched a career as a television football commentator. His autobiography, Nummer eins (“Number One”), was published in 2004.
