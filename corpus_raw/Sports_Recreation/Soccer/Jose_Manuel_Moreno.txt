José Manuel Moreno,  (born August 3, 1916, Buenos Aires, Argentina—died August 26, 1978), Argentine football (soccer) player who starred with the club River Plate during the 1940s and was a member of its celebrated “La Maquina” (“The Machine”) attack, considered by many as the best attacking line in the history of South American club football. Moreno, whose talent was said to be comparable to that of Pelé and Diego Maradona, played for the Argentine national team 33 times between 1937 and 1947. He also played on two South American Championship teams (1941 and 1947).
Moreno began playing with River Plate in Buenos Aires as a junior and then, between 1935 and 1948, was a member of the club’s famous five-man La Maquina forward line, famed for its precision passing and high production of goals. Moreno played 321 games for River Plate, scoring 179 goals and winning five league titles (1936, 1937, 1941, 1942, and 1947). He briefly left River Plate in 1945 to play with España in Mexico, where he also won a championship.
Moreno was notorious for his off-hour carousing, yet he always made a tremendous difference to his teams. In 1949 he won the Chilean league title with Universidad Catolica and then became one of the few former River Plate players to play for their archrivals Boca Juniors. Later he played for Defensor (Uruguay) and FC Oeste (Argentina) before ending his career with Independiente Medellín in Colombia, where he won three more titles (1954, 1955, and 1957) before retiring at age 41.
