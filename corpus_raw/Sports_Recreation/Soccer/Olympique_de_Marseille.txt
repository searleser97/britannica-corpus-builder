Olympique de Marseille,  French professional football (soccer) club founded in 1899 and based in Marseille.
Established as a general sports club that originally focused on  rugby, Olympique de Marseille won the first of 10 French Cup trophies in 1924 and its first French top-division (known as Ligue 1) championship in the 1936–37 season. Relegated from Ligue 1 in 1959, the club arguably reached its lowest point when just 434 spectators attended an April 1965 match against Forbach. A change of fortunes in the early 1970s saw the club win two consecutive league titles. The first of these came during the 1970–71 season, propelled by Croatian forward Josip Skoblar, whose 44 goals that season remain a French league record.
A flurry of spending by club chairman Bernard Tapie in the mid-1980s brought world-class footballers such as Didier Deschamps, Enzo Francescoli, Eric Cantona, and Jean-Pierre Papin to Marseille. The team responded by winning five consecutive Ligue 1 titles (1988–89 to 1992–93). It also reached the semifinals of the European Cup in 1990, was runner-up in 1991, and in 1993 defeated AC Milan 1–0 to become the first French team to win the Champions League (as the European Cup has been known since 1992). However, after the team was later found guilty in a match-fixing scandal, its chairman was imprisoned, and the club was stripped of its 1992–93 Ligue 1 title. Relegation to the second division followed the next year, but Olympique de Marseille quickly returned to the top flight. The club underwent a major revival with finishes near the top of the Ligue 1 table between 2006–07 and 2008–09, which led to another top-division championship in 2009–10.
