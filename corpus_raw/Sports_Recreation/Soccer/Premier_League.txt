Premier League, also called Premiership,  English professional football (soccer) league established in 1992. The league, which comprises 20 clubs, superseded the first division of the English Football League (EFL) as the top level of football in England.
During a Premier League season, each club plays one home and one away match with every other team in the league. A match victory gives the winning team three points in the standings, while a draw results in one point for each club. The league has no postseason tournament: the team with the most points at the end of the season is the Premier League champion. The top four point-scoring teams each year qualify for the next season’s Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League tournament, which pits the most successful domestic teams in European football against each other for the annual title of best European club. Meanwhile, the bottom three clubs of the Premier League are relegated (dropped), and the top three finishers of first-division (EFL Championship) teams of the EFL are promoted to the Premier League.
The league was formed by the first-division clubs following the 1991–92 season in order to maximize the economic potential of English football. The new league quickly improved the comfort and safety of stadiums, signed lucrative broadcast and sponsorship deals, and began attracting many of the world’s top players and managers. In 1998 Scotland established its own premier league.
