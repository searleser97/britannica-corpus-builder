Al-Masry, (Arabic: “The Egyptian”) byname the Green Eagles,  Egyptian professional football (soccer) club based in Port Said. Al-Masry is one of Egypt’s oldest and best-supported football clubs. The team is nicknamed the Green Eagles for its green jerseys and its crest, which is composed of an eagle with a green ball between its two upraised wings. The club was one of the founding members of the Egyptian Football Association in 1921 and the Egyptian League (now known as the Egyptian Premier League) in 1948.
Al-Masry was formed in 1920 as the first sports club for Egyptians in Port Said, which at the time had many clubs for the British communities that existed in Egypt as result of its occupation by British  forces. The club has won a number of domestic titles, including three Sultan Hussein Cups (1933, 1934, and 1937); 17 consecutive Canal Zone League championships, beginning with the 1931–32 season; and one Egypt Cup (1998).
Al-Masry plays in the 18,000-seat Port Said Stadium, which, in February 2012, was the site of one of the deadliest disasters in the history of organized sports. Immediately following a 3–1 victory over Cairo-based club Al-Ahly, Al-Masry fans stormed the pitch and opposing stands; 74 people died in the attack and subsequent rush to the stadium exits. Many suspected that the attack had been organized and politically motivated, as it took place nearly one year after a notable clash during the Egypt uprising of 2011—a number of Al-Ahly fans had been prominent protesters in Tahrir Square against the Hosni Mubarak regime—and many of the attacking Al-Masry fans were armed with weapons (including knives, swords, and clubs). As a result, the remainder of the 2011–12 Egyptian Premier League season was canceled, Al-Masry did not participate in the league during the following season, and the club was banned from playing in Port Said Stadium for four calendar years.
