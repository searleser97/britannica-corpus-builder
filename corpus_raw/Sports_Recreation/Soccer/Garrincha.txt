Garrincha, byname of Manoel Francisco dos Santos,  (born Oct. 18, 1933, Pau Grande, Braz.—died Jan. 20, 1983, Rio de Janeiro), Brazilian football (soccer) player considered by many to be the best right winger in the history of the sport. An imaginative and skillful dribbler, he starred along with Pelé and Didí on the Brazilian national teams that won two World Cup Championships (1958, 1962).
His brother gave him the name Garrincha (“Little Bird”) because of his misshapen legs, the result of childhood polio. He made his professional debut in 1947 with Pau Grande and later played with Serrano, Corinthians, Flamengo, Bangu, Portuguesa Santista, Sao Cristovao, and Olaria and Colombia’s Atletico Junior. His best years were with Botafogo (1957–62), which he led to three Brazilian league championships. He played 60 times for Brazil and in three World Cups (1958, 1962, and 1966). He starred in the 1962 tournament, scoring two goals against England in the quarterfinals and two more in the semifinals against Chile.
An undisciplined yet brilliant forward, Garrincha often frustrated coaches and opponents but was always a favourite with fans, who were spellbound by his artistry. His career ended when his legs began to deteriorate. Away from football, he had several marriages (including one to famous Brazilian singer Elsa Soares) and struggled with alcoholism and poverty.
