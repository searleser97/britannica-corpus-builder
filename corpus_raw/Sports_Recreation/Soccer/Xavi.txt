Xavi, byname of Xavier Hernández Creus,  (born January 25, 1980, Terrassa, Spain), Spanish football (soccer) player who was widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world in the early 21st century.
At age 11 Xavi joined the youth squad of FC Barcelona, a first-division football club near his hometown. He advanced through the club’s various junior ranks before making his first-team debut in 1998. In his first season with the team, Barcelona won the 1998–99 La Liga—Spain’s top football league—championship. Xavi’s playing time steadily increased over the following seasons, and he was a key member of the club when it won the 2004–05 La Liga title. Xavi and Barcelona successfully defended the La Liga championship in 2005–06 and  captured the Champions League title that season as well. The team bested this accomplishment in 2008–09 as it won the first “treble” (winning three major European club titles in one season) in Barcelona history—taking the La Liga title, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. Xavi helped Barcelona to additional La Liga titles in 2010–11 and 2012–13 as well as a Copa del Rey victory in 2011–12. In March 2015 he announced that he was leaving Barcelona for Qatar’s Al-Sadd at the end of the 2014–15 season. He finished his storied Barcelona career on a high note as the club won another treble that season. He retired from club play in May 2019 and was named the manager of Al-Sadd soon thereafter.
Just 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 metres) tall, Xavi made up for his short stature with an unparalleled field vision, superb ball-handling skills, and the ability to make crisp, precise passes. More of a playmaker than a prolific scorer, Xavi led La Liga in assists in both 2008–09 and 2009–10.
In international play, Xavi was the captain of the Spanish under-20 team that won the FIFA World Youth Championship in 1999. Shortly after helping Spain to a silver medal at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, he was promoted to the Spanish senior team. Xavi played sparingly at the 2002 World Cup and did not get off the bench at the 2004 European Championship (Euro 2004). He was a regular in the Spanish lineup by the time the team played in the 2006 World Cup, but he had his first notable international success at Euro 2008. There he led Spain to its first major international title in 44 years and was named Player of the Tournament after skillfully orchestrating the Spanish offense throughout the event. The team’s success continued at the 2010 World Cup, where Xavi helped Spain win the first World Cup championship in the country’s history. In 2012 Spain captured another Euro title, which made the team the first national squad to win three consecutive major world championships and led many observers to argue that Xavi’s club was the greatest national team in football history. An aging Spanish team could not continue its dominance at the 2014 World Cup, however, where the squad was handily beaten in its first two games and was eliminated from the tournament, and soon afterward Xavi retired from international football.
