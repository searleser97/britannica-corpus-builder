Inter Milan, in full Football Club Internazionale Milano,  Italian professional football (soccer) team based in Milan. Inter Milan is the only Italian club never to have been relegated to a league below the country’s top division, Serie A.
Inter was formed in 1908 by a breakaway group of players from the Milan Cricket and Football Club (now known as AC Milan) who wanted their club to accept more foreign players; Inter’s first club captain, Hernst Marktl, was Swiss. Inter won its first Italian league championship in 1910 and has amassed 18 domestic league titles in total, including a run of five consecutive titles from 2005–06 (the original winner that year, Juventus, was stripped of the title for its role in a match-fixing scandal) to 2009–10. In 2010 Inter became the first Italian club to capture the “treble” of a domestic top-division title (the Serie A championship), a domestic cup (the Italian Cup), and a continental championship (Champions League) in a single year. In international competiton, the club has won three European Cup/Champions League titles (1964, 1965, and 2010), two Intercontinental Club Cup titles (beating Independiente of Argentina in 1964 and 1965), and three Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Cups (now UEFA Europa League; 1991, 1994, and 1998).
Inter shares its home ground, the San Siro Stadium (1926),  with its biggest rival, AC Milan. The first game played at the San Siro was a match between the two Milan sides, with Inter beating AC Milan 6–3. The following year the great Giuseppe Meazza played his first game for Inter. His final game would come in 1947, by which time the gifted attacker had scored 287 goals for Inter in 408 matches. In 1980, a year after Meazza died, the stadium was officially renamed in his honour, though it continues to be best known as San Siro.
