Lev Ivanovich Yashin,  (born October 22, 1929, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.—died March 21, 1990, Moscow), Russian football (soccer) player considered by many to be the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the game. In 1963 he was named European Footballer of the Year, the only time a keeper has won the award.
In 1945 Yashin joined Moscow’s Dynamo club as an ice hockey player, but he was discovered by the celebrated football goalkeeper Alexei Khomich, who trained Yashin to be his successor. Yashin debuted with Dynamo in 1953 and remained with the club until his retirement in 1971. During that time Dynamo won five league titles (1954–55, 1957, 1959, 1963) and three cups (1953, 1967, 1970). He also enjoyed considerable success with the Soviet national team, for whom he debuted in 1954. He helped the team win the gold medal at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, and claim the first ever European Championship in 1960. At World Cup Yashin was the keeper for Soviet runs to the quarterfinals in 1958 and 1962, as well as for the team’s fourth-place finish in 1966.
Throughout his career Yashin collected nicknames such as “black panther,” “black spider,” and “black octopus” because of his black uniform and his innovative style of play. He was one of the first keepers to dominate the entire penalty area, and on the goal line he was capable of acrobatic saves. In his career he recorded 207 shutouts and 150 penalty saves. He received the Order of Lenin in 1968. He became a coach after his retirement.
