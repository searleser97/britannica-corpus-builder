São Paulo FC, in full São Paulo Futebol Clube,  Brazilian professional football (soccer) club based in São Paulo. São Paulo FC is one of the most popular clubs in Brazil, and the club’s six national league titles are more than any other Brazilian team.
São Paulo was formed in 1935 by the merger of two football clubs, Clube de Regatas Tietê and São Paulo da Floresta. São Paulo struggled initially against teams such as Corinthians and Palmeiras, which played with São Paulo in the regional Campeonato Paulista league. However, São Paulo would improve quickly and eventually win the Paulista championship 21 times. The club plays its home matches at the giant Morumbi Stadium. Opened in 1960 after nine years of construction, the stadium seats up to 80,000 people. In the past even more fans were squeezed in, with the stadium’s record attendance being 138,032 in 1977.
After years of Brazil being home to only regional leagues, a Brazilian national league was formed in 1971, and São Paulo finished the first season as runners-up in the top division, Serie A, commonly called “Brasileirão.” The team won the Brasileirão for the first time in 1977 and has since secured a record total of six championships.
In international competition, the club has won the Copa Libertadores (for South America’s leading football clubs) three times—twice under the gifted Brazilian coach Telê Santana (1992 and 1993), with a further victory coming in 2005. In addition, it beat FC Barcelona to win the 1992 Intercontinental Cup, which it followed by triumphing over AC Milan to repeat the feat the next year. São Paulo also captured the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) Club World Cup in 2005.
Many top-class Brazilian footballers have played for São Paulo, including Serginho Chulapa (also known as Sérgio Bernardino)—the club’s leading goal scorer with more than 240 goals—and Rogerio Ceni, the long-serving goalkeeper who played in more than 800 matches with the club.
