Ferenc Puskás, also called the Galloping Major,  (born April 2, 1927, Budapest, Hungary—died November 17, 2006, Budapest), Hungarian professional football (soccer) player who was the sport’s first international superstar. Puskás scored 83 goals in 84 games with the Hungarian national team and was a member of three European Cup-winning teams (1959, 1960, 1966) with the Spanish club Real Madrid.
Puskás grew up outside of Budapest in Kispest, where he made his debut for the small town’s football club (known as Honved after World War II) at age 16. With Honved he won five Hungarian championships (1949–50, 1950, 1952, 1954, 1955) and was the top goal scorer in all of Europe in 1948. He had first played for the Hungarian national team in 1945, and he quickly made a name for himself as the possessor of an incredibly accurate left-footed shot. A striker whose short heavyset build belied his outstanding agility and ball-control skills, Puskás was the centrepiece of one of the most dominant sides in the history of the sport. Known as the “Magical Magyars,” the Hungarian national team posted an outstanding record of 43 wins, 7 ties, 1 loss between 1950 and 1956, and it captured the gold medal at the 1952 Helsinki Olympic Games along the way. The team’s one loss during that period came in the final of the 1954 World Cup, in which Hungary—with Puskás attempting to play through an ankle injury—was upset by West Germany 3–2. In 1956 Puskás was playing a match with Honved in Spain when the Hungarian Revolution broke out, and he joined a number of his teammates in defecting to Spain.
Puskás joined Real Madrid shortly after his defection. There he teamed with Alfredo di Stefano to form one of the most dangerous scoring duos in the world. Puskás scored 512 goals in 528 appearances for the Spanish club and was instrumental in Real Madrid’s five consecutive league championships (1961–65) and three European Cup titles. After becoming a Spanish citizen in 1961, he represented Spain at the 1962 World Cup, but he failed to score a goal in four matches. He retired from play in 1966 and worked for several years as a coach. In 1993 Puskás returned to Budapest, where in 2002 the football stadium was renamed in his honour.
