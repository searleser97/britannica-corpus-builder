Dynamo Kiev, in full Football Club Dynamo Kiev, also called FC Dynamo Kiev,  Ukrainian professional football (soccer) team located in Kiev. Dynamo Kiev was one of the strongest teams in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union) and is the dominant team in the Ukrainian league.
In 1923 a system of sports and physical education clubs and societies was instituted in the Soviet Union. These were called Dynamo (or Dinamo), from the Greek word meaning “power” or “power in movement.” The Dynamo in Kiev was formed in 1927 and played its first game on June 17, 1928, against another Dynamo, from Odessa.
Kiev finished second in the first Soviet national championship in 1936. The club won the first of its 13 Soviet league championships in 1961. A player on that 1961 team, Valery Lobanovsky, would become the club’s most famous manager during two stints leading the team (1973–90, 1996–2001). Kiev’s home stadium was renamed for Lobanovsky in 2002. Under his tutelage, Kiev won the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1975 and became the first club from the Soviet Union to win a European trophy. Later that year Kiev beat a powerful Bayern Munich team 1–0 and 2–0 in two games to win the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Super Cup. Kiev won another Winners’ Cup in the 1985–86 season, beating Atlético Madrid in the final.
With the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kiev began competing in the Ukrainian Premier League. It won nine league championships in a row from the 1992–93 season onward, and it has won the competition 15 times in total. The club has produced many notable footballers over the years, including the backbone of a number of Soviet and Ukrainian national teams. Two Kiev players, both strikers, have won the coveted European Footballer of the Year award: Oleg Blokhin in 1975 and Igor Belanov in 1986.
