Don Shula, byname of Donald Francis Shula,  (born January 4, 1930, Grand River, Ohio, U.S.—died May 4, 2020, Indian Creek, Florida), American professional gridiron football player and coach, notably of the National Football League (NFL) Miami Dolphins (1970–95), who won more games (347) than any other NFL coach.
At Harvey High School (Painesville, Ohio) he was an all-around athlete, playing baseball and basketball as well as football, and at John Carroll University (JCU; Cleveland, Ohio) he played halfback and defensive back. He received a B.S. degree in 1951 from JCU and an M.A. in physical education in 1953 from Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland).
Shula played professionally for the Cleveland Browns (1951–52), the Baltimore Colts (1953–56), and the Washington Redskins (1957). He began coaching in 1958 as an assistant at the University of Virginia and the following year at the University of Kentucky. He was defensive backfield coach for the Detroit Lions (1960–62) before becoming head coach of the Baltimore Colts in 1963. His Baltimore teams won division championships in 1964 and 1968; the 1968 team went on to capture the NFL championship but lost the Super Bowl. Overall, the Colts under Shula won 71 games, lost 23, and tied 4 in seven regular seasons.
After becoming coach of the Miami Dolphins in 1970, he became the first NFL coach to win 100 regular-season games in 10 seasons (1963–72). In 1971 Miami won the conference championship but lost the Super Bowl. The Dolphins in the 1972 season became the first team to go undefeated through their entire schedule and the playoffs, culminating with a win in the Super Bowl. The team won a second Super Bowl the following season. Shula again guided the Dolphins to the Super Bowl in the 1982 and 1984 seasons, but the team lost both times. On November 14, 1993, Shula scored his 325th career victory, breaking George Halas’s record. He retired after the 1995 season with a record of 347–173–6 (.665), including playoff games, and he was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1997.
