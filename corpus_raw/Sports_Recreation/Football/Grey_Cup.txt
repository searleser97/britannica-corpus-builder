Grey Cup,  trophy awarded annually to the winner of the professional Canadian Football League (CFL) play-offs. The cup was first awarded in 1909 by Earl Grey, governor-general of Canada, to represent the amateur football championship, and the early years of competition were dominated by collegiate teams. Canadian football closely resembled rugby football in its early years, but by the mid-20th century it had adopted a gridiron style of play. By the 1950s competition for the cup was dominated by professional teams, and in 1966 trusteeship of the cup passed to the CFL. The annual game is broadcast throughout Canada and is preceded by a weeklong festival.
A list of Grey Cup winners is provided in the table.
