Elroy Hirsch, in full Elroy Leon Hirsch, byname Crazylegs,  (born June 17, 1923, Wausau, Wis., U.S.—died Jan. 28, 2004, Madison, Wis.), American gridiron football player, sports administrator, and actor who rose to fame as a collegiate star and who was a record-setting wide receiver with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL).
In 1942 Hirsch played halfback on the University of Wisconsin’s football team and earned the nickname “Crazylegs” for an unorthodox running style that made him difficult to tackle. The following year he enlisted in the Marines and began officer training at the University of Michigan. There he became the school’s only athlete to letter in four sports in the same year (football, basketball, baseball, and track). After World War II, Hirsch began playing professional football with the Chicago Rockets (1946–48) of the All-America Football Conference and endured several injury-plagued seasons before joining the NFL’s Rams in 1949. Moved to the split end position, he became an integral part of the team’s formidable offense, which relied heavily on the forward pass and featured a tandem of Hall of Fame quarterbacks Bob Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin. In the 1951 season Hirsch led the league in catches (66) and touchdown receptions (17) and set an NFL record (since broken) for receiving yards (1,495). His play helped the Rams win the NFL championship that year. Hirsch’s immense popularity led to appearances in several movies during his playing days, including the autobiographical Crazylegs (1953) and Unchained (1955).
In 1957 he retired from professional football with 387 career receptions for 7,029 yards and 60 touchdowns. He later served as athletic director (1969–87) at the University of Wisconsin and helped turn around the school’s struggling sports program. Hirsch was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968.
