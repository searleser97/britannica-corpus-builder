Emlen Tunnell, in full Emlen Lewis Tunnell,  (born March 29, 1925, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died July 23, 1975, Pleasantville, New York), American gridiron football player who in 1967 became the first African American to be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His career stretched from 1948 through 1961, and he was a key member of National Football League (NFL) championship teams in New York and Green Bay.
In 1942, at the University of Toledo, a broken neck appeared to end Tunnell’s football career. Though rejected by both the U.S. Army and Navy because of his injury, he was finally accepted by the U.S. Coast Guard, where he served until 1946. Upon leaving the service, he entered the University of Iowa and played football for two seasons until an eye operation forced him to drop out of school. He hitchhiked to New York in 1948 and asked the New York Giants for a tryout. There he earned a contract for $5,000, with a $1,000 bonus.
Tunnell concentrated on defense, intercepting 17 passes in his first two seasons. When unlimited substitution became the NFL rule in 1950, his value increased. His brilliant pass coverage and unerring tackling made him the first player to receive widespread public acclaim as a defensive back. At the same time, he was recognized as the most dangerous punt returner in the league. He was often called the Giants’ “offense on defense.”
Tunnell was a star for the Giants’ 1956 NFL championship team. He was traded in 1959 to the Green Bay Packers, where his veteran presence helped the team win a league championship in 1961. At his retirement he held league records (since broken) for interceptions (79), yards gained on interceptions (1,282), punt returns (258), and yards gained on punt returns (2,209). Honoured as one of the premier players of his day, he was chosen all-NFL four times and was selected for nine Pro Bowls.
