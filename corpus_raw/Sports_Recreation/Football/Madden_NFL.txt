Madden NFL,  video game sports-simulation series created by EA Sports, a division of the American company Electronic Arts, and based on the National Football League (NFL). Its name derives from John Madden, a famous gridiron football coach and television colour commentator. EA Sports has held exclusive licensing rights with the NFL since 2005, making Madden NFL the only American football video game available with all the NFL teams and their players.
Madden NFL originated in 1989 as John Madden Football, a computer software title for the Apple II. The franchise was popularized with a move to the Sega Genesis console in 1990 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. The name was changed to Madden NFL in 1993, when it gained full licensing and began releasing titles corresponding to each NFL season for multiple gaming consoles.
In the early 21st century, Madden NFL developed innovative game-play modes to heighten realism and expand on the NFL gaming experience. The ability to create and manage an NFL franchise, assemble a playbook, and design a stadium were well received. Also, advances in realistic player movement and mechanics enhanced the game’s appeal. However, as other video game software companies were legally forced to discontinue NFL titles, there was controversy over EA’s incentive to continue to improve upon the series in a market where it had no competitors. Despite these concerns, Madden NFL 2007 broke sales records after selling more than 3.9 million copies, further establishing the franchise’s dominance in NFL gaming.
