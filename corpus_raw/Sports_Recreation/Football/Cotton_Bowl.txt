Cotton Bowl,  postseason U.S. collegiate gridiron football game played on New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day in Arlington, Texas.
The Cotton Bowl was conceived by Dallas oilman J. Curtis Sanford. The first game was played in 1937. After the 1940 game, a group of Dallas citizens acquired control of the game and named themselves the Cotton Bowl Athletic Association, which later that year became an agency of the Southwest Conference. It was the only bowl game controlled and operated by a single athletic conference until the Southwest Conference disbanded in 1996. Formerly one of the four most prestigious bowl games, the Cotton Bowl lost that status in the 1990s when the College Bowl Coalition and then the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) replaced it with the Fiesta Bowl. In 2014 it once again became one of the premier bowl games in the country when it was included in the six-bowl rotation (along with the Fiesta, Orange, Peach, Rose, and Sugar bowls) to host the semifinals of the College Football Playoff.
A list of Cotton Bowl results is provided in the table.
