Serge Blanco,  (born Aug. 31, 1958, Caracas, Venez.), French rugby player regarded as perhaps the best attacking fullback in the history of rugby union. Between 1980 and 1991, he played 93 games for the French national team, an international rugby record at the time. Arguably his countryâ€™s greatest rugby footballer, Blanco was noted for his long runs from the last line of defense, quickly turning defensive play into attacking play. This may be due to the fact that he began his career as a winger, playing that position 12 times for France before switching to fullback.
Blanco, born in Venezuela, was a young boy when his family moved to France, where he was introduced to rugby. For much of his career he played alongside French greats Phillipe Sella and Jean-Pierre Rives and inspired many memorable French victories in the Five Nations Championship. He famously scored a spectacular length-of-the-field try to eliminate favoured Australia from the 1987 Rugby World Cup semifinal. Blanco scored a record 38 tries for France. He also captained France in 17 Test (international) matches. After his playing career ended, he served as president of his longtime club team, Biarritz Olympique, and as president of the French rugby union league. He also had several successful business ventures, including a clothing line and a number of luxury hotels.
