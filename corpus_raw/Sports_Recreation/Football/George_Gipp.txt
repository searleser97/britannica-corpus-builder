George Gipp, byname the Gipper,  (born February 18, 1895, Laurium, Michigan, U.S.—died December 14, 1920, South Bend, Indiana), American gridiron football player at the University of Notre Dame (1917–20) who became a school legend.
Gipp entered Notre Dame on a baseball scholarship, but he was recruited for football by the coach Knute Rockne, who saw Gipp drop-kicking and passing a football on a field adjacent to the practice field. Gipp played 32 consecutive games for Notre Dame and scored 83 touchdowns. In one 1917 game he was apparently going to punt but instead drop-kicked a 62-yard field goal. Gipp was named captain of the team for 1920, but he was expelled from the university for missing too many classes and frequenting off-limits establishments. He was an assistant to Rockne before being reinstated as a student. In his last season he enjoyed one of his greatest performances, gaining a total of 324 yards and leading Notre Dame, down 14–7 at halftime, to a 27–17 victory over Army. Later that season he fell ill and eventually developed the pneumonia from which he died. Two weeks prior to his death, he became Notre Dame’s first All-American.
At halftime during a scoreless game with Army in 1928, Rockne asked the team to “win one for the Gipper,” keeping a promise that he said he had made to Gipp on his deathbed. It is unlikely that Gipp ever made such a request, but the story reinforced the Gipp legend. (Notre Dame rallied to beat Army 12–6 that year.) The legend was further burnished when Ronald Reagan (the future U.S. president) played the role of Gipp in the film Knute Rockne—All American (1940).
