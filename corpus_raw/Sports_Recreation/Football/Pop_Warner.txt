Pop Warner, byname of Glenn Scobey Warner,  (born April 5, 1871, Springville, New York, U.S.—died September 7, 1954, Palo Alto, California), American college gridiron football coach who devised the dominant offensive systems used over the first half of the 20th century. Over a 44-year career as coach (1895–1938), Warner won 319 games, the most in the NCAA until the 1980s. He also is remembered for having given his name to one of the country’s major football organizations for young boys, the Pop Warner Youth Football League, in 1934.
At Cornell University (New York), Warner excelled in several sports while obtaining his law degree (1894). He then coached at the University of Georgia (1895–96) and Cornell (1897–98) before accepting a position at the Carlisle (Pennsylvania) Indian Industrial School, where he coached from 1899 through 1903 and 1907 through 1914 (returning to Cornell for the three seasons between the two stints). After complaints from players about his profanity and abusive treatment led to Warner’s dismissal from Carlisle, he coached at the University of Pittsburgh (1915–23), winning two unofficial national championships; at Stanford University (1924–32) in California, where his teams played in three Rose Bowls; and finally at Temple University (1933–38) in Philadelphia.
Warner’s popular image is most closely tied to his association at Carlisle with Jim Thorpe, their relationship immortalized (and romanticized) in the 1951 film Jim Thorpe—All-American. But his chief contributions to football were the wingback formations he introduced at Carlisle and further developed at Pittsburgh and Stanford. In the single wing the ball was snapped to a tailback lined up behind the centre about five yards deep, with the fullback, quarterback, and wingback to one side, each a little wider than the last and closer to the line. Warner generally used an unbalanced line; that is, he placed four linemen to the side of the centre where the backs were lined up in order to further strengthen the running attack to that side. The less-popular double wing, developed at Stanford, was a more balanced formation, with the quarterback shifted into a wingback position on the side opposite from the other backs. Over the 1940s and ’50s, Warner’s single wing was gradually replaced by the split-T as the dominant offensive system.
