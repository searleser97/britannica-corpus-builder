Dan Marino, in full Daniel Constantine Marino, Jr.,  (born September 15, 1961, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American gridiron football quarterback who was one of the most prolific passers in National Football League (NFL) history.
Marino was a high school All-American in Pittsburgh, where he established himself as another of the great quarterbacks to hail from western Pennsylvania, alongside such luminaries as Johnny Unitas, Joe Montana, and Joe Namath. Unlike those quarterbacks, Marino stayed home to play at the University of Pittsburgh, earning All-American honours in his junior year. After a disappointing senior season by Marino’s standards, his professional stock dropped, and he was chosen by the Miami Dolphins toward the end of the first round of the 1983 NFL draft.
Miami’s investment paid immediate dividends. Marino stepped in as the team’s starting quarterback six games into his rookie year. He then led the Dolphins to a play-off berth and was named to the Pro Bowl. In 1984 he became the first quarterback to pass for more than 5,000 yards in a single season (5,084) and the first to complete more than 40 touchdown passes (48) in a season (his records were broken by Drew Brees and Peyton Manning, respectively). Marino was named the NFL’s Most Valuable Player, and at the end of that season he made the only Super Bowl appearance of his career; the Dolphins lost that game to Montana and the San Francisco 49ers.
Over the course of his career, he led the NFL in passing yards on four more occasions (1985, 1986, 1988, 1992) and in touchdown passes an additional two times (1985, 1986). Marino and the Dolphins appeared in the conference championship game in 1985 and 1992, but Miami advanced no farther than that point in the postseason during his 17-year career. Although his teams were not as successful as those of other elite quarterbacks, Marino was nevertheless one of the most dominant players at his position: by the end of his final season (1999), he had set all-time records for passes completed (4,453 in 7,452 attempts), yards passing (55,416), touchdown passes (385), and a number of other categories. (Marino’s most prominent career marks were later broken by Brett Favre.)
He was a popular pitchman for a number of products both before and after his retirement. After leaving the sport, he worked as a football commentator on television until 2014, when he joined the Dolphins’ front office. A three-time All-Pro selection and nine-time Pro Bowl honoree, Marino was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005.
