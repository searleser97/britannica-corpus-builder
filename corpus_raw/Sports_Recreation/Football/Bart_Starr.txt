Bart Starr, byname of Bryan Bartlett Starr,  (born January 9, 1934, Montgomery, Alabama, U.S.—died May 26, 2019, Birmingham, Alabama), American collegiate and professional gridiron football quarterback and professional coach who led the National Football League (NFL) Green Bay Packers to five league championships (1961–62, 1965–67) and to Super Bowl victories following the 1966 and 1967 seasons.
Starr was quarterback for the University of Alabama (1952–55), completing 8 of 12 passes in the 1953 Orange Bowl victory over Syracuse and directing the team to a loss in the 1954 Cotton Bowl. He was drafted in the 17th round by the Packers in 1956 and played with them through the 1971 season. He became the team’s starting quarterback in 1959, the first season Vince Lombardi coached the Packers. A great leader and field tactician, Starr was particularly effective in postseason games: in six NFL title games, he completed 84 of 145 passes attempted for 1,090 yards, with only one interception. His performance in his two Super Bowl games was outstanding, and he was named Most Valuable Player in both of them. Four times All-NFL (1961–62, 1964, 1966), he led the league in percentage of passes completed four times (1962, 1966, and 1968–69) and average yards gained three times (1966–68). In 1964–65 he attempted 294 passes without interception, a record that survived until 1991.
After retiring as a player in 1972, Starr became head coach of the Packers from 1975 through 1983; however, his coaching success did not equal his success as a player. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.
