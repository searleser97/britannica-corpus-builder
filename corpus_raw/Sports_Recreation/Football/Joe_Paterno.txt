Joe Paterno, byname of Joseph Vincent Paterno, also called JoePa,  (born December 21, 1926, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died January 22, 2012, State College, Pennsylvania), American collegiate gridiron football coach, who, as head coach at Pennsylvania State University (1966–2011), was the winningest major-college coach in the history of the sport, with 409 career victories, but whose accomplishments were in many ways overshadowed by a sex-abuse scandal that occurred during his tenure.
Paterno served in the U.S. Army in the final year of World War II before accepting an athletic scholarship to Brown University, where he studied English literature and played quarterback for the football team. Upon graduation in 1950, he intended to enroll in law school but was lured away when his former coach at Brown, Charles (“Rip”) Engle, became head coach at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). After 16 years as Engle’s assistant, Paterno succeeded him in 1966.
Paterno made an immediate impact on the program, leading Penn State to consecutive undefeated seasons in 1968 and 1969. The team posted another undefeated season in 1973. However, Penn State was denied a national championship in each of these three seasons, as it failed to finish first in the final football writers’ polls that determined the national champion at that time. Penn State won its first national championship of the Paterno era in 1982 and added another—as well as a fourth undefeated season—in 1986. Penn State started playing football in the Big Ten Conference in 1993, and it won a conference title the following year after Paterno guided the Nittany Lions to a record of 12 wins and 0 losses.
In January 2002 Paterno became the first active coach in 20 years to receive the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award, the highest honour given by the American Football Coaches Association. A five-time winner of the association’s Coach of the Year award, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2007. Not content only to build the football program, Paterno was an advocate for academic integrity and donated millions to build up the nonsporting programs of the university.
However, events in 2011 permanently tarnished Paterno’s reputation. In November of that year, Jerry Sandusky, a long-time Paterno assistant coach (1969–99) who continued to have access to the football team and its facilities after his retirement, was arrested and charged with 48 counts related to the sexual abuse of boys between 1994 and 2009. A number of instances of abuse were alleged to have taken place on Penn State property, including a 2002 incident reported by a graduate assistant to Paterno, who in turn reported it to the Penn State athletic director. No further action was taken at Penn State, and no police report was filed at the time. After Sandusky’s 2011 arrest, Paterno was criticized for his failure to pursue the matter in 2002 and for being among the numerous Penn State officials who allowed Sandusky access to the university for nearly another decade. Amid public outcry over Sandusky and institutional inaction toward the allegations against him, Paterno announced his intent to retire at the end of the season, but instead he was fired shortly after his announcement. He was diagnosed with lung cancer just days after his firing, and he spent his remaining months in poor health before ultimately succumbing to the disease. (In June 2012 Sandusky was found guilty on 45 of the 48 counts against him; he was later sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.)
An independent investigation led by former FBI director Louis Freeh released a report in July 2012 that accused Paterno and other Penn State officials of actively covering up Sandusky’s behaviour between 1998 (when Penn State officials learned about Sandusky’s alleged crimes) and 2011. Weeks later the National Collegiate Athletic Association announced sanctions against Penn State, which included a $60 million fine, a four-year bowl ban, and the vacating of all football wins between 1998 and 2011. This final punishment temporarily removed Paterno from atop the list of all-time major college football coaching victories, reducing his career win total from 409 to 298, before the wins were reinstated as part of the settlement of a lawsuit in 2015.
