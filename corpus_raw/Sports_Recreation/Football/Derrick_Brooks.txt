Derrick Brooks, in full Derrick Dewan Brooks,  (born April 18, 1973, Pensacola, Florida, U.S.), American gridiron football player who, in his 14-year career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL), established himself as one of the greatest linebackers in the history of the sport.
Brooks was a standout safety in high school and was recruited to play that position at Florida State University. The team’s coaching staff switched him to outside linebacker late in his freshman year, and, though undersized (6 feet [1.83 metres], 210 pounds [95 kg]) for the position, Brooks excelled, earning consensus All-American honours as a junior and senior. He was selected by the Buccaneers in the first round of the 1995 NFL draft.
When Brooks joined the team, the Buccaneers were a long-woeful franchise, having lost 10 or more games for 12 consecutive seasons between 1983 and 1994. Brooks was the key piece of a turnaround in Tampa Bay, as the Bucs defense quickly became one of the most dominant units in the league, finishing in the top 10 in fewest yards allowed in nine straight seasons from 1997. He excelled in the team’s signature defensive alignment—the “Tampa 2”—which made great use of his excellent instincts and sure tackling ability. Brooks helped the team to seven play-off appearances in his 14 years with Tampa Bay, one of which ended in the franchise’s first Super Bowl victory (2003). Over the course of his professional career, he added 25 pounds [11 kg] of muscle but maintained the exceptional speed he had as a young defensive back, which helped him amass 25 career interceptions.
Brooks was the 2002 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, was a five-time first-team All-Pro selection, and was named to 11 career Pro Bowls. He was released by the Buccaneers in 2009 and officially retired in 2010 after failing to sign with another team. In 2014 he was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
