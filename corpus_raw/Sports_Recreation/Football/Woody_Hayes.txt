Woody Hayes, byname of Wayne Woodrow Hayes,  (born February 14, 1913, Clifton, Ohio, U.S.—died March 12, 1987, Upper Arlington, Ohio), American collegiate gridiron football coach whose career coaching record was 238 games won, 72 lost, and 10 tied. He developed 58 All-American players, and his Ohio State University teams (1951–78) won 3 national championships (1954, 1957, and 1968) and 13 Big Ten championships and played in 8 Rose Bowl games (winning 4).
Hayes graduated in 1935 from Denison University in Ohio and then taught and coached football in Ohio high schools (1936–40). In World War II he served in the U.S. Navy (1941–46). After the war he coached at Denison (1946–48) and at Miami University (Oxford, Ohio; 1949–50).
In 1951 he became head coach at Ohio State. There he became known as a conservative coach and a stern taskmaster; during games he was aggressive and defiant, berating officials and destroying sideline yard markers in his wrath. His iron-fisted style was accepted, even celebrated, in the 1950s and ’60s, but as times changed, Hayes did not. He was discharged as coach in 1978 after a nationally televised game during which he struck a Clemson University player who had intercepted an Ohio State pass. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983.
