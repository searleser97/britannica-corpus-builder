George Allen, in full George Herbert Allen,  (born April 29, 1922, Detroit, Mich., U.S.—died  Dec. 31, 1990, Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.), American professional football coach.
Allen attended Alma College (Michigan) and Marquette University (Wisconsin) and received an M.S. from the University of Michigan (1947). After coaching teams at Morningside College (Iowa) and Whittier College (California), he entered the National Football League as offensive-end coach with the Los Angeles Rams (1957). As an assistant coach of the Chicago Bears (1958–66) he coached the team’s defensive unit in its 1963 league championship season. As head coach of the Los Angeles Rams from 1966 to 1970, he traded promising young talent to acquire experienced players, won two Western Division championships, and had the best win-loss-tie record (49–17–4) in the league for that period. His years of coaching the Washington Redskins (1971–77) were perhaps even more remarkable, for they included three consecutive Eastern Division championships, again after building his team around veteran players.
Allen went on to coach the Chicago Blitz (1983) and Arizona Wranglers (1984) in the short-lived United States Football League. In 1989 he returned to college football, coaching for a season at Long Beach State University (California). In 14 seasons as head coach of professional football teams Allen’s record was 144–69–5.
