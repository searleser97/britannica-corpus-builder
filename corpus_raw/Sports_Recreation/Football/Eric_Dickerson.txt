Eric Dickerson, in full Eric Demetric Dickerson,  (born September 2, 1960, Sealy, Texas, U.S.), American professional gridiron football player who was one of the leading running backs in National Football League (NFL) history.
Dickerson played his college football at Southern Methodist University (SMU) in University Park, Texas, where he and Craig James formed a stellar backfield that was dubbed the “Pony Express” (after SMU’s mustang mascot). Named an All-American in his senior season, Dickerson was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams with the second overall selection of the 1983 NFL draft. In his rookie year in the NFL, he led the league in rushing and earned All-Pro and Offensive Rookie of the Year honours. In 1984 Dickerson rushed for a league-record 2,105 yards. He again led the NFL in rushing in 1986 and 1988—after being traded to the Indianapolis Colts in the middle of the 1987 season.
Later he played for the Los Angeles Raiders and the Atlanta Falcons. He retired soon after being traded to the Green Bay Packers in 1993, ending his 11-year NFL career after a damaged disk in his back made it too risky for him to play. He left the sport second only to Walter Payton as the leading rusher in NFL history up to that date, with 13,259 yards. Dickerson was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.
