Frank Leahy, byname of Francis William Leahy,  (born August 27, 1908, O’Neill, Nebraska, U.S.—died June 21, 1973, Portland, Oregon), American college gridiron football coach whose teams at the University of Notre Dame won 87 games, lost 11, and tied 9. His career winning percentage of .864 (107–13–9) ranks second in the history of first-division college football to that of Knute Rockne, a predecessor at Notre Dame.
Leahy played at Notre Dame under Rockne in 1929, but a knee injury in 1930 ended his playing career. While he was recuperating from a knee operation, he shared a hospital room with Rockne, who was struck with Leahy’s football acumen and made him informally a coach of the tackles until his graduation in 1931. Leahy began his coaching career in earnest as line coach at Georgetown University (1931) and at Michigan State University (1932). He became line coach under Jim Crowley at Fordham University (1933–38), creating the formidable line called the “Seven Blocks of Granite.” Leahy became a head coach at Boston College in 1939 and went to Notre Dame in 1941. During his career at Notre Dame (he retired in 1953), his teams won four national championships and remained unbeaten in 39 consecutive games (1946–50).
Though nearly as successful as Rockne—his teams in the late 1940s were more dominant than Rockne’s best—Leahy lacked Rockne’s personal charm and skill in cultivating sportswriters; thus, he never enjoyed his predecessor’s popular affection. After his retirement from football, he was a business executive, a sports columnist, and a television commentator. He is in the College Football Hall of Fame.
