Percy Duncan Haughton,  (born July 11, 1876, Staten Island, N.Y., U.S.—died  Oct. 27, 1924, New York, N.Y.), innovative American college football coach whose Harvard University teams (1908–16) won 71 games, lost 7, and tied 5.
An 1899 graduate of Harvard, where he was an outstanding football and baseball player, Haughton coached strictly disciplined teams whose play was precisely coordinated; they excelled in deceptive plays that threw the opposition off balance. Haughton introduced such novelties as the hidden ball, forward-pass combinations, and the lateral pass.
