Bobby Bowden, in full Robert Cleckler Bowden,  (born November 8, 1929, Birmingham, Alabama, U.S.—died August 8, 2021, Tallahassee, Florida), American collegiate gridiron football coach who was one of the winningest coaches in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) history.
Bowden played quarterback at the University of Alabama as a freshman but, in accordance with university policy at the time, was forced to give up his scholarship after marrying his high-school sweetheart. He then transferred to Howard College (now Samford University) in his hometown, Birmingham, Alabama. After graduating from Howard in 1953, Bowden was an assistant football coach there for two years before becoming the athletic director and head coach at South Georgia College (1956–58), a two-year institution. He returned to Howard in 1959 as head coach, but he left the school in 1962 to become an assistant coach at the highest level of collegiate football (the University Division, now called the Football Bowl Subdivision), first as the wide receivers coach at Florida State University (1963–65) and then as the offensive coordinator at West Virginia University (1966–69). He was promoted to head coach at West Virginia in 1970. Bowden had a 42–26 record at West Virginia and guided the Mountaineers to two bowl appearances before taking the head coaching position at Florida State in 1976.
It was at Florida State that Bowden became a coaching icon. His 5–6 record in 1976 was the only losing record he posted as the team’s head coach. In 1982 Florida State went 9–3 and received an invitation to the Gator Bowl, which began a streak of 28 consecutive bowl appearances for the Seminoles under Bowden. In 1993 Florida State went 12–1 and captured its first national championship. Bowden led Florida State to a second national championship in 1999, as the undefeated Seminoles became the first team in college football history to be voted number one in the Associated Press (AP) poll in every week of the season. Between 1987 and 2000 he guided the Seminoles to an extraordinary 14 consecutive top-five finishes in the AP poll.
In the first decade of the 21st century, Bowden and Pennsylvania State University’s Joe Paterno were in a back-and-forth race for the all-time record for “major college” coaching victories in a career. Some observers questioned the validity of Bowden’s wins at Howard College, which included victories over junior colleges and a freshman team. In 2010—just weeks after Bowden’s retirement—the NCAA stripped Florida State of 12 wins from the 2006 and 2007 seasons after the football program was found guilty of widespread academic fraud. Upon his retirement, Bowden was second to Paterno in career wins, but he temporarily became the all-time winningest coach in 2012, when the NCAA stripped Paterno of 111 wins as punishment for a years-long sex scandal at his school. However, those victories were reinstated to Paterno’s record as part of the settlement of a lawsuit in 2015.
Bowden officially amassed 377 wins (as well as 129 losses and 4 ties) in his 44-year non-junior-college coaching career. In addition, he led Florida State to 12 Atlantic Coast Conference titles in the 18 seasons the formerly independent Seminoles played in the conference during his tenure. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006.
