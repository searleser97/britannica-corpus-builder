Peach Bowl, formerly (2006–13) Chick-fil-A Bowl,  annual college gridiron football postseason bowl game played in Atlanta. Along with the Cotton, Fiesta, Orange, Rose, and Sugar bowls, the Peach Bowl is one of the host sites of the national semifinals of the College Football Playoff.
The first Peach Bowl was played in 1968 at the on-campus stadium of the Georgia Institute of Technology, where Louisiana State defeated Florida State 31–27. In 1971 the game moved to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, home of the Atlanta Braves, where it was played until the opening of the Georgia Dome in 1992. That same year the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Southeastern Conference agreed to make the Peach Bowl an annual contest between teams from those two conferences, an arrangement that lasted until the advent of the College Football Playoff system and the elimination of conference tie-ins for the Peach Bowl in 2014.
A list of Peach Bowl results is provided in the table.
