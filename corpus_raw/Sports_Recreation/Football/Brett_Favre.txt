Brett Favre, in full Brett Lorenzo Favre,  (born October 10, 1969, Gulfport, Mississippi, U.S.), American professional gridiron football player who broke all the major National Football League (NFL) career passing records as quarterback of the Green Bay Packers.
Favre grew up in Kiln, Mississippi, and attended the University of Southern Mississippi, where he became the football team’s starting quarterback while a freshman. He was drafted by the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons in 1991 but was traded to Green Bay the following year after falling out of favour with Atlanta’s coaching staff. Originally a backup quarterback, he started for an injured teammate in the third game of the 1992 season and never relinquished the position. In 1993 Favre led the Packers to their first play-off appearance in 10 years, and he established himself as one of the premier quarterbacks in the NFL. Known for his agility, competitiveness, and field presence, he was named the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) a record three consecutive times (1995, 1996, 1997) and led the league in touchdown passes in each MVP year.
At the end of the 1996 season, Favre led the Packers to victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI. He returned to the Super Bowl the following year, but the Packers lost to John Elway’s Denver Broncos in the waning minutes of the game. The Packers were less successful in the years following their two Super Bowl runs, but Favre continued to be productive. He led the league in pass completions in 1998 and 2005, and he had the most passing yards and touchdown passes in 1998 and 2003, respectively. He finished in the top 10 in completions, passing yards, and touchdown passes in every season between 1992 and 2007. In addition to these single-season accomplishments, Favre reached unprecedented individual statistical milestones over the course of his career. In the 2007 season he broke Elway’s record of 148 career wins as a starting quarterback and Dan Marino’s all-time records of 420 touchdown passes and 61,371 passing yards as well as George Blanda’s career interception record of 277. Favre announced his retirement from professional football at the end of the 2007 NFL season.
In July 2008 Favre let it be known that he wanted to return to the NFL, and he was reinstated by the league the following month. However, his strained relationship with Packers management—as well as the team’s commitment to a new starting quarterback—led the Packers to trade him to the New York Jets before the start of the 2008 NFL season. While he was named to his 10th career Pro Bowl in 2008, Favre’s one season with the Jets was nevertheless a disappointment. Not only did he lead the league in interceptions and finish the year ranked 21st in passer rating, but, after an 8–3 start, the Jets won a total of only nine games and missed the play-offs. Citing diminished playing skills and an injured biceps, Favre retired once more in February 2009. His previous indecision led many to speculate that he would end his second retirement as the NFL season neared, and, just weeks after publicly stating that he would not be returning, in August 2009 Favre signed to play with the Minnesota Vikings.
Favre had one of his best seasons in 2009: he set career highs in completion percentage and passer rating and threw only seven interceptions. He guided the Vikings to a 12–4 record and a berth in the NFC championship game. However, his remarkable season ended on a sour note, as he threw a last-minute interception with the Vikings in range of a game-winning field goal attempt, which allowed the New Orleans Saints to win the NFC championship in overtime. A significant shoulder injury forced Favre to miss the 13th game of the 2010 season, ending his streak of 297 consecutive regular-season games started—a record for durability at his position—and he retired a third time at season’s end. Favre finished his career with 508 touchdown passes and 71,838 passing yards, NFL records that were subsequently broken by Peyton Manning. Favre was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016.
