Jim Parker, in full James Thomas Parker, byname Jumbo Jim,  (born April 3, 1934, Macon, Ga., U.S.—died July 18, 2005, Columbia, Md.), American professional gridiron football player who, during his 11-year career with the Baltimore Colts, established himself as one of the finest offensive linemen in National Football League (NFL) history.
Parker played collegiate football at The Ohio State University under legendary head coach Woody Hayes. He played on both the offensive and defensive sides of the ball, earning unanimous All-America honours and winning the Outland Trophy as the country’s top lineman in 1956. Parker was selected by the Colts with the eighth overall choice in the 1957 NFL draft.
Parker became the team’s starting left tackle, where the rookie was responsible for protecting the blind side of iconic quarterback Johnny Unitas. The 6-foot 3-inch (1.91-metre), 273-pound (124-kg) Parker readily took to the job, and in his second season in the league he earned the first of four consecutive Pro Bowl and All-Pro honours. He anchored Baltimore’s offensive lines that helped the team to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959. During the 1962 season, Parker switched to left guard and promptly earned dual All-Pro and Pro Bowl recognition at that position in each season through 1965. In 1973 he became the first full-time offensive lineman inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and he was named to the NFL’s 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994.
