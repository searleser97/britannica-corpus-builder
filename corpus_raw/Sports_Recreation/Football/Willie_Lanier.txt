Willie Lanier, in full Willie Edward Lanier,  (born August 21, 1945, Clover, Virginia, U.S.), American professional gridiron football player who was an outstanding defensive player for the Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s and ’70s, overturning the stereotype that African Americans could not handle the key defensive position of middle linebacker.
Lanier was named to the Little All-America team (for players in small-college programs) while at Morgan State University (Baltimore, Maryland). In 1967 the Kansas City Chiefs selected him in the second round of the first combined American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) draft. The Chiefs had lost 35–10 to the Green Bay Packers in the first Super Bowl earlier that year and focused on defensive players in the draft.
Lanier became the starting middle linebacker in his rookie season, which was cut short by an injury. The next year, the Chiefs were 12–2, and Lanier began a streak of eight consecutive Pro Bowl selections. In his third season, Lanier led the Chiefs to the final AFL championship prior to the league’s merging with the NFL. As AFL champions, the Chiefs unexpectedly defeated the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV in 1970, with Lanier making an interception and the defense shutting out Minnesota in the first half on the way to a 23–7 victory.
Although the Chiefs made the play-offs just one more time in his career, Lanier remained a defensive star in the league. Called “Honey Bear” by his teammates, Lanier was a ferocious tackler. After concussions early in his career, he wore a specially padded helmet to protect himself from his own tremendous collisions. He had 15 career fumble recoveries and 27 pass interceptions, with 2 returned for touchdowns. He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986.
