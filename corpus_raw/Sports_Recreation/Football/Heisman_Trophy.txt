Heisman Trophy,  award given annually to the outstanding college gridiron football player in the United States as determined by a poll of sportswriters. The trophy was instituted in 1935 by the Downtown Athletic Club of New York City and the next year was named in honour of its first athletic director, John Heisman, a player and successful coach of the 1890s and early 1900s. The first winner of the trophy was John J. (“Jay”) Berwanger of the University of Chicago. Running back Archie Griffin of the Ohio State University is the only two-time winner of the Heisman (1974 and 1975).
