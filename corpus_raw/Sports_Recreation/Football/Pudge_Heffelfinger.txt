Pudge Heffelfinger, byname of William Walter Heffelfinger,  (born December 20, 1867, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.—died April 2, 1954, Blessing, Texas), collegiate gridiron football player and coach who exemplified the spirit of the early years of American football. Standing well over 6 feet (1.8 metres) tall and weighing just over 200 pounds (91 kg), Heffelfinger was among the largest and fastest players of his era.
Heffelfinger organized a Central High School (Minneapolis) football team in 1884 and played on the University of Minnesota team while still in high school. He entered Yale University in 1888 and made the varsity team as a guard. The Yale teams he played on were undefeated in 1888 and 1891. He was named All-American in 1889, the first year selections were made, and also in 1890 and 1891. Heffelfinger introduced the concept of the running, or pulling, guard to the game, the forerunner of modern blocking. After college he was the first documented American football player to be paid: $500 plus travel expenses for a game in Pittsburgh in 1892, in which he scored a touchdown on a fumble recovery for the only points in the Allegheny Athletic Association’s victory over the Pittsburgh Athletic Club.
In 1893, as a coach, he introduced the kind of football played in the East, which developed into the present U.S. game, to the University of California, Berkeley, where hitherto the game played had been basically rugby. In the 1930s he published Heffelfinger Football Facts and ran an advertising agency that produced the first sports quiz on radio. He continued to play in semiprofessional and exhibition football games, as well as to partake in Yale practices, until age 65.
