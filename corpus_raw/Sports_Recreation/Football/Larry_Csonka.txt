Larry Csonka, byname of Lawrence Richard Csonka,  (born Dec. 25, 1946, Stow, Ohio, U.S.), American gridiron football player who won two Super Bowls (1973, 1974) playing for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL) and was named Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl VIII.
Csonka was an All-American fullback at Syracuse University, where he was noted for his straight-ahead power. He was chosen by the Dolphins with the eighth selection of the 1968 NFL draft, and he was immediately thrust into the team’s starting lineup. In each of three consecutive years (1971–73) he rushed for more than 1,000 yards, and in 1972 he was a mainstay in the Dolphin’s perfect 17–0 season. After moving to the short-lived World Football League in 1975, Csonka returned to the NFL to play for the New York Giants from 1976 to 1978 before finishing his career with the Dolphins in 1979. Csonka was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987.
