Cal Hubbard, byname of Robert Calvin Hubbard,  (born Oct. 31, 1900, Keytesville, Mo., U.S.—died Oct. 17, 1977, St. Petersburg, Fla.), American collegiate and professional gridiron football player and American League (AL) baseball umpire, the only person elected to the collegiate and professional football Halls of Fame (1962, 1963) as well as the Baseball Hall of Fame (1976).
Hubbard was an admirer of coach Bo McMillin and played football for him at Centenary College (Shreveport, La.) and Geneva College (Beaver Falls, Pa.); he was named All-American at tackle (1926–27). McMillin called him the best football player, collegiate or professional, he had ever seen. From 1927 until 1936 Hubbard played in the National Football League (NFL) with the New York Giants, the Green Bay Packers, and the Pittsburgh Pirates (later the Steelers). He was a key part of four title-winning teams as an end on a devastating 1927 Giants defense that allowed just 20 points in 13 games and as a stalwart left tackle on Packers squads that won three straight NFL championships from 1929 to 1931. He was named to the NFL All-Time team in 1969.
During football off-seasons, Hubbard umpired in baseball minor leagues from 1925 through 1935, and in 1936 he moved up to the American League. He retired from the field in 1951 after being struck in the eye by a shotgun pellet in a hunting accident. Thereafter he was supervisor of American League umpires until 1968. He also served on the Official Playing Rules Committee (1959–69).
