Reggie White, byname of Reginald Howard White,  (born December 19, 1961, Chattanooga, Tennessee, U.S.—died December 26, 2004, Huntersville, North Carolina), American professional gridiron football player who was one of the most dominant defensive linemen in the history of the sport. In his 15-year National Football League (NFL) career, he was selected to the Pro Bowl 13 consecutive times, and, at the time of his retirement in 2000, he was the NFL’s all-time career leader in sacks with 198 (the record has since been broken).
White played football at the University of Tennessee, where he was an All-American his senior year. The 6-foot 5-inch (1.96-meter), 300-pound (136-kg) defensive lineman began his professional career in 1984 playing for the United States Football League (USFL) Memphis Showboats, where he had 11 sacks and was named to the all-rookie team. After two seasons in the USFL, he was acquired in the NFL supplemental draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, for which he played from 1985 to 1992. In 1987 he recorded 21 sacks and was the league’s Defensive Player of the Year.
In 1992 White was the most prominent member of a group of NFL players that successfully sued the league for violating antitrust laws via its limited free agency system. The following year the NFL instituted full free agency for the first time, and White became the most sought-after player on the market. He signed with the Green Bay Packers after a long courtship process. White’s dominant play continued with his new team, and he helped shape Green Bay into one of the premier defensive teams in the NFL. In 1997 the Packers made it to their first Super Bowl in 29 years, where they defeated the New England Patriots. White won his second Defensive Player of the Year award in 1998 after posting 16 sacks during the regular season, and he abruptly retired after Green Bay’s opening-round play-off loss in the following postseason. After one year away from the sport, he signed with the Carolina Panthers, where he recorded a career-low 5.5 sacks in his one season with the team.
White was an ordained Baptist minister, which was the source of his nickname, the “Minister of Defense.” Reggie White in the Trenches: The Autobiography appeared in 1996. White was posthumously inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006.
