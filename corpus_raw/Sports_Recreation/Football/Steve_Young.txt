Steve Young, in full Jon Steven Young,  (born October 11, 1961, Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.), American gridiron football player who is considered one of the most accurate quarterbacks in National Football League (NFL) history.
Young was raised in Connecticut, where he was all-state in football and baseball at Greenwich High School. He was the great-great-great-grandson of Brigham Young, an early leader of the Mormon church, and he later attended Brigham Young University, where he earned a law degree in 1994. Young broke 13 national college records, including his .713 completion percentage in 1983, when he was recognized as one of the top five student athletes in the United States.
The Cincinnati Bengals intended to make Young the first pick of the 1984 NFL draft, but Young accepted a $40-million-dollar deal (the richest contract in team sports history at the time) with the Los Angeles Express of the short-lived United States Football League (USFL). In two seasons with a bad team, he completed only 56.4 percent of his passes with 16 touchdowns and 22 interceptions. He bought out his contract with the Express after the spring season of 1985, but his NFL rights belonged to the equally hapless Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In the two seasons there, Young had a .533 completion rate, throwing 11 touchdowns and 21 interceptions.
In 1987 Young was traded to the San Francisco 49ers, where he worked as a backup to future NFL Hall of Famer Joe Montana. When an elbow injury sidelined Montana in 1991, Young became the starting quarterback for the 49ers. From 1991 to 1994, Young led the NFL in passing, earning league most valuable player (MVP) honours in 1992 and 1994. He finished the 1994 season with a 112.8 passer rating, a mark he achieved on a scale where 100 was meant to be the realistic maximum. He also led the league in yards per pass attempt, averaging a gain of 8.7 yards every time he released the ball. He capped this extraordinary run by leading the 49ers to victory over the San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995. Young threw a record-setting six touchdowns in a 24-for-36 performance that earned him recognition as the game’s MVP.
In 1997 Young led the team to the National Football Conference (NFC) championship game, and two years later he was selected to his seventh Pro Bowl. When he retired in 1999, Young had a career passer rating of 96.8. He subsequently was an analyst for a number of sports programs, and he also worked as a motivational speaker. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005. Young’s memoir, QB: My Life Behind the Spiral (written with Jeff Benedict), was published in 2016.
