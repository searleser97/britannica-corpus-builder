Aaron Rodgers, in full Aaron Charles Rodgers,  (born December 2, 1983, Chico, California, U.S.), American professional gridiron football quarterback who is considered one of the greatest to ever play the position. He led the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL) to a Super Bowl championship in 2011.
Though Rodgers was a star quarterback at Pleasant Valley High School in Chico, he was not heavily recruited by college football teams. He played for a year at Butte College, a community college in nearby Oroville, before transferring in 2003 to the University of California, Berkeley. He soon took over as the starting quarterback for the school’s Golden Bears, and in 2004 he guided the team to a 10–2 record and a number nine ranking in the season’s final Associated Press poll. Rodgers was named first-team All-Pacific-10 Conference and was chosen by the Packers in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft. He then began a long apprenticeship as the team’s backup quarterback behind starter Brett Favre. In his first three seasons (2005–07) in the league, Rodgers saw only limited action, appearing in just seven games.
That changed in 2008 when Favre—after a bitter falling-out with team management—was traded to the New York Jets and the Packers’ offense was handed over to Rodgers. He quickly proved himself to be an able replacement for Favre, passing that season for 4,038 yards and 28 touchdowns. Rodgers was awarded a six-year, $65 million contract extension, and in 2009 his stellar passing continued as he threw for 4,434 yards and 30 touchdowns while leading the Packers to an 11–5 record and a playoff berth. He thus became the only NFL player ever to post consecutive 4,000-yard passing campaigns in his first two years as a starter. He also recorded a 103.2 passer rating in 2009, second best in franchise history, behind Bart Starr’s 1966 mark of 105.0, and was selected to play in the Pro Bowl.
In 2010 Rodgers led the Packers to a 10–6 regular-season record and a berth in the playoffs as the sixth-seeded team in the National Football Conference (NFC). In the postseason, he helped the team notch road victories over the top three seeds in the NFC—including a victory over the rival Chicago Bears in the conference championship game—to secure a spot in the Super Bowl. There he completed 24 of 39 pass attempts for 304 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions to lead Green Bay to a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, which earned Rodgers the game’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.
Rodgers followed his Super Bowl victory with one of the greatest quarterback seasons of all time in 2011. He guided the Packers to a franchise-best 13–0 start and finished the regular season with 45 touchdowns, 4,643 passing yards, and an NFL-record 122.5 passer rating. Rodgers won the NFL MVP award for his stellar year, but his team disappointed in the playoffs. Having lost just one regular-season game, the Packers were upset at home in their first postseason contest by the eventual champion New York Giants.
He again led the NFL in passer rating in 2012 (108.0) and led the Packers to a division title. Rodgers missed seven games of the 2013 regular season with a fractured collarbone but returned for the regular-season finale against the Bears to lead a game-winning fourth-quarter drive that clinched the division for the Packers. In 2014 he threw for 4,381 yards, 38 touchdowns, and just 5 interceptions to earn his second NFL MVP award. The Packers returned to the NFC championship game in the following postseason but lost a dramatic overtime contest against the Seattle Seahawks. The following year Rodgers led Green Bay to a franchise-best seventh consecutive playoff appearance but had the worst passer rating of his years as a full-time starting quarterback (92.7). He rebounded in 2016, leading the NFL with 40 touchdown passes as he led the Packers to six straight wins to finish the regular season, win a division title, and advance to the NFC championship game (a loss to the Atlanta Falcons).
A broken collarbone limited Rodgers to playing just seven games of the 2017 season, and his absence led to the end of the Packers’ eight-year playoff streak. He played in all 16 of the Packers’ games in 2018 and threw 25 touchdowns to a career-low (for a full season) 2 interceptions, but Green Bay struggled on defense and finished with a 6–9–1 record to again miss the playoffs. Those disappointing seasons led to an off-season coaching change, and a revamped Packers squad won 13 games in 2019 as Rodgers threw for 4,002 yards and 26 touchdowns. Green Bay won its first playoff game in the following postseason but lost to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC championship game.
