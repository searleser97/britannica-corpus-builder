Don Hutson, byname of Donald Montgomery Hutson,  (born Jan. 31, 1913, Pine Bluff, Ark., U.S.—died June 26, 1997, Rancho Mirage, Calif.), American professional gridiron football player who, in his 11-year career from 1935 to 1945 in the National Football League (NFL), defined the role of the receiver in the modern passing game and created many of the sport’s pass routes. In addition to playing wide receiver, he was a skilled placekicker and defensive safety.
After graduation from the University of Alabama, Hutson played with the Green Bay Packers of the NFL (1935–45). He led the league in scoring for five consecutive years (1940–44), in touchdowns eight times (1935–38, 1941–44), in pass receptions eight times (1936–37, 1939, and 1941–45), and in yards gained by pass receptions seven times (1936, 1938–39, and 1941–44). Though Hutson was slight of build, his speed, precision routes, and reliable hands tormented opposing defenses, and he became the first player in the NFL to be covered by two or more defenders. In 1942, his greatest season, he set NFL records (subsequently tied or broken) by catching 74 passes for 1,211 yards and 17 touchdowns; he also kicked 33 points after touchdown and one field goal for a total of 138 points, which remained the NFL single-season scoring record until 1960. From Sept. 12, 1937, to Dec. 2, 1945, he caught at least one pass in each of 95 consecutive games.
Hutson was chosen a member of the NFL’s All-Pro team nine times and was named the league’s Most Valuable Player in 1941 and 1942. On his retirement he held NFL career records of 823 points, 105 total touchdowns, 99 touchdowns on passes caught, 488 pass receptions, and 7,991 yards gained by receiving passes. These records have all since been broken, but the fact that his touchdown receptions mark stood into the late 1980s—long after the landscape of the NFL had drastically changed to emphasize the forward pass—is a testament to how far ahead of his peers Hutson was. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963 as a member of the institution’s inaugural class, and he was named to the NFL’s 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994.
