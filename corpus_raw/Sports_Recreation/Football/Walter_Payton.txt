Walter Payton, in full Walter Jerry Payton, byname Sweetness,  (born July 25, 1954, Columbia, Mississippi, U.S.—died November 1, 1999, Barrington, Illinois), American professional gridiron football player whose  productivity and durability made him one of the game’s greatest running backs. He retired in 1987 as the leading rusher in the history of the National Football League (NFL), a title he held until 2002, when he was surpassed by Emmitt Smith.
Payton played football in high school and at Jackson State University in Mississippi. It was during his college years that he gained the sobriquet “Sweetness” for his affable personality and graceful athleticism. In addition to his role as starting running back, he was also an occasional kicker at Jackson State, and his four-year total of 464 points was a National Collegiate Athletic Association record. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears with the fourth overall selection of the 1975 NFL draft. Payton was named to the first of nine career Pro Bowls in his second season, and in 1977 he won the league’s Most Valuable Player award after leading the NFL in rushing yards (1,852; a franchise record) and rushing touchdowns (14). In the 1985 season he helped the Bears post a 15–1 record and win the franchise’s first Super Bowl title the following January. He retired after the 1987 season.
Besides being an outstanding rusher, Payton was a capable blocker, pass receiver, and even passer. He was best known, however, for his pinball running style, in which he often bounced off would-be tacklers. His rigorous off-season training regimen contributed to his durability; he started in more than 180 consecutive games in his career. He set NFL records—all of which have since been broken—for total career rushing yardage (16,726 yards), most combined career yards from scrimmage (rushing and pass receiving, 21,264 yards), most seasons with 1,000 or more yards rushing (10), most yards gained in a single game (275 yards), most games with 100 or more yards gained in a career (77), and most career touchdowns earned by rushing (110).
Payton was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993, and in 1994 he was named to the NFL’s 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. The Walter Payton Award, established in 1987, is presented annually to the top player in the Football Championship Subdivision of college football. Payton during his final year of life, while suffering from a rare liver disease, was credited with awakening national interest in organ donation.
