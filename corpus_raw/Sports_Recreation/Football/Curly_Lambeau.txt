Curly Lambeau, byname of Earl Louis Lambeau,  (born April 9, 1898, Green Bay, Wisconsin, U.S.—died June 1, 1965, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin), American gridiron football coach who had one of the longest and most distinguished careers in the history of the game. A founder of the Green Bay Packers in 1919, he served through 1949 as head coach of the only major team in American professional sports to survive in a small city.
After playing briefly for the University of Notre Dame, Lambeau collaborated with George Calhoun, a Green Bay newspaperman, in organizing a professional football team, called the Packers because it received a subsidy from a local meat-packing firm. In 1921 the Packers entered the American Professional Football Association (which in 1922 became the National Football League [NFL]). Lambeau led the team to six NFL championships (1929–31, 1936, 1939, 1944). In addition to coaching and serving as general manager, he played tailback (1919–29) and was noted as a passer. He then coached the NFL’s first strong passing teams, with Arnie Herber throwing to Don Hutson.
Lambeau was dismissed after the 1949 season in a dispute with the Packers’ management. He subsequently coached the Chicago Cardinals (1950–51) and the Washington Redskins (1952–53). He was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963 with a career record of 229 wins, 134 losses, and 22 ties, the NFL’s fourth highest win total at the turn of the 21st century. After his death in 1965, the Green Bay Packers rechristened their stadium Lambeau Field.
