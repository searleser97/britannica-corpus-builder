Bob Zuppke, byname of Robert Carl Zuppke,  (born July 2, 1879, Berlin, Ger.—died  Dec. 22, 1957, Champaign, Ill., U.S.), American college football coach, credited with introducing (in the early 1920s) the offensive huddle, enabling the team with the ball to plan each play immediately before executing it. He inspired his former player, George Halas, to help form the National Football League (NFL) by lamenting that college players quit playing just as they were beginning to learn how to really play.
Emigrating to the United States with his family in 1881, Zuppke was reared in Milwaukee, Wis. After graduation from the University of Wisconsin, he coached in high school until 1913, when he became head football coach at the University of Illinois, Urbana. In 29 seasons his Illinois teams won 131 games, lost 81, and tied 12. Perhaps their greatest victories were upsets of supposedly invincible teams from the universities of Minnesota (1916) and Michigan (1939). Zuppke’s 1927 team was named national champion, and his 1923 team was awarded the same honour, retrospectively, by the Helms Athletic Foundation. He is in the College Football Hall of Fame.
