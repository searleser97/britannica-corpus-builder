LaDainian Tomlinson, byname L.T.,  (born June 23, 1979, Rosebud, Texas, U.S.), American professional gridiron football player who was one of the most productive running backs in National Football League (NFL) history.
Tomlinson attended high school in Waco, Texas, where he earned second-team all-state honours his senior season but was mostly overlooked by the major college football programs. He chose to attend Texas Christian University (TCU) in nearby Fort Worth, and in both his junior and senior years at TCU he was collegiate football’s leading rusher. He finished fourth in the voting for the Heisman Trophy in 2000 and was selected by the San Diego Chargers with the fifth overall pick in the first round of the NFL draft in 2001.
At 1.77 metres (5 feet 10 inches) and about 100 kg (220 pounds), Tomlinson was considered small for an NFL running back. But what he lacked in size, he made up for with a hard-nosed running style and terrific speed in the open field. He was also one of the most versatile players in the game, gaining more than 1,200 rushing yards—as well as making more than 50 pass receptions—in each of his first seven seasons. In 2003 Tomlinson became the only NFL player ever to rush for 1,000 yards and catch 100 passes in the same season, and he was one of only seven players in the history of the league to have run, caught, and passed for a touchdown in a single game.
In 2006 Tomlinson led the league in rushing yards and broke both Shaun Alexander’s record for most touchdowns scored in one season (31) and the 46-year-old record for most single-season points scored (186). Earlier in the season Tomlinson had reached another milestone when he scored the 100th touchdown of his NFL career, accomplishing the feat in just 89 games—quicker than anyone else in league history. Tomlinson’s success led to his selection as the NFL’s Most Valuable Player for the 2006 season. His landmark year propelled the Chargers to a 14–2 record in 2006—the best in the NFL—but they were upset in their first play-off game by the New England Patriots. Tomlinson led the NFL in rushing yards and rushing touchdowns again in the 2007 season, and he helped the Chargers advance to the American Football Conference championship game in January 2008. However, his numbers declined over the following two seasons, and in 2010 he was released by San Diego. He then signed a free-agent contract with the New York Jets. Tomlinson played two seasons with the Jets, and he retired in 2012—after having signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the Chargers—with 162 career touchdowns, the third highest total in NFL history at the time of his retirement. In 2017 he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
