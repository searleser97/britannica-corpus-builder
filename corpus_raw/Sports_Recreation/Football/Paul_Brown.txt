Paul Brown, in full Paul Eugene Brown,  (born September 7, 1908, Norwalk, Ohio, U.S.—died August 5, 1991, Cincinnati, Ohio), American gridiron football coach known for his cerebral approach, innovative methods, iron rule, and cool demeanour. Brown coached winning teams in high school, college, armed forces, and professional football.
Brown was an undersized quarterback at Miami University (Ohio), where he received a B.A. in education in 1930. He took a job as a teacher and football coach at Servern Prep School in 1930, compiling a 16–1–1 record in two seasons. From 1932 to 1940 he coached his high-school alma mater at Massillon, Ohio, to several state championships and an 80–8–2 record. He became head coach at Ohio State University in 1941, where his teams went 18–9–1 and won the national collegiate championship in 1942. In 1944–45 he coached the team at Great Lakes Training Station, going 15–5–2.
While at Great Lakes he agreed to coach Cleveland’s professional team, scheduled to begin play in 1946 in the new All-America Football Conference. Brown’s popularity in Ohio was such that the team was named the Browns in his honour. During the AAFC’s four seasons, the Browns won all four championships, with a total record 52–4–3. In 1950 the Browns moved to the National Football League (NFL) and immediately won the championship; they also won titles in 1954–55. Although Brown’s teams continued to win, he was fired by Cleveland’s owner Art Modell in 1962. After a six-year retirement, he returned to the NFL as founder and coach of an expansion team, the Cincinnati Bengals, and by the third year the team had won its division. He retired from coaching in 1975 but remained team president until his death. Overall his professsional record was 222–102–9.
Among the unique methods and innovations for which Brown was famous were classroom study and notebooks for players (he even gave written tests), extensive use of film to grade player performance as well as to spot tendencies of opponents and his own team, the modern pass-blocking “pocket,” the face mask, “messenger guards” so the coach could call plays, extensive use of “trap blocking” in the rushing attack, and sophisticated pass patterns. Many of his former players and assistants went on to coaching success in the NFL, including Hall of Famers Weeb Ewbank, Chuck Noll, Don Shula, and Bill Walsh. Brown was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967.
