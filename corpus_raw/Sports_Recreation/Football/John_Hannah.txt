John Hannah, in full John Allen Hannah, byname Hog,  (born April 4, 1951, Canton, Ga., U.S.), American professional gridiron football player whose combination of size, strength, and athleticism helped him redefine the guard position. Hannah played for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) from 1973 to 1985 and was named All-Pro on seven occasions.
Hannah was a notable multisport athlete in high school: in addition to being a star on the football team, he won the national heavyweight prep wrestling championship in 1967. He played collegiate football at the University of Alabama, where he was a three-year starter on the offensive line and a consensus All-American in his senior season. Hannah was chosen by the Patriots with the fourth overall selection of the 1973 NFL draft.
Hannah was immediately inserted in the starting lineup upon joining the Patriots. His 6-foot 2-inch (1.88-metre), 265-pound (120-kg) frame was considered to be exceptionally large at that time in football history, and his size was augmented by remarkable quickness and agility that made Hannah especially effective when blocking in space on runs downfield and when pulling to engage a defensive player at the end of the line. Hannah’s spectacular run blocking was a major factor in the Patriots’ setting the NFL single-season team rushing record by piling up 3,165 yards in 1978. He was also a standout pass blocker and is regarded by many observers as the greatest interior offensive lineman in league history.
After helping the Patriots franchise make its first Super Bowl appearance in January 1986 (a loss to the Chicago Bears), Hannah retired from the sport. He then became an investment banker and later launched a Christian-oriented corporate training company. A nine-time career Pro Bowl honoree, Hannah was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1991 and was named to the NFL’s 75th Anniversary All-Time Team in 1994.
