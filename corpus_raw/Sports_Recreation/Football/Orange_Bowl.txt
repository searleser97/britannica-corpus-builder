Orange Bowl,  American college postseason gridiron football game played on New Year’s Eve or New Year’s Day in Miami. It is one of six bowls that take turns hosting the semifinals of the College Football Playoff that determines the national champion of Division I college football (the others are the Cotton Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Peach Bowl, Rose Bowl, and Sugar Bowl).
The bowl game was first played in 1933 to attract winter tourists to Florida a month before their usual arrival. Embraced by local businessmen, it also benefited the struggling young University of Miami, which played in the early games; by 1936, however, the team’s participation was no longer automatic. Thereafter, at least one of the participating teams came from the South, until the mid-1950s, when the bowl was opened to high-ranking teams nationwide. The champion of the Big 8 Conference (now the Big 12) was one of the participants in 38 of the 42 games from 1954 through 1995. In 1998 the Orange Bowl joined the Bowl Championship Series (BCS), and in 2014 it became part of the College Football Playoff semifinal rotation. Now the game has a tie-in with the Atlantic Coast Conference and generally features its champion unless the team or the bowl is participating in a national championship semifinal.
The event was originally called the Palm Festival, but its present name was adopted in 1935. The game was moved in 1938 to the newly constructed Orange Bowl stadium, where it remained until it relocated to Joe Robbie Stadium (now called Sun Life Stadium) in 1995. The Orange Bowl Festival features, in addition to the football game, a parade, a tennis tournament, a basketball tournament, a fireworks display, and a sailboat regatta.
