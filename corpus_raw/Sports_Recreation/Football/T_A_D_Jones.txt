T.A.D. Jones, in full Thomas Albert Dwight Jones, byname Tad Jones,  (born Feb. 21, 1887, Excello, Ohio, U.S.—died June 19, 1957, New Haven, Conn.), American collegiate gridiron football coach who led the Yale team through the 1910s and ’20s.
Jones played football in Middletown, Ohio; at Phillips Exeter Academy (1903–04) in Exeter, N.H.; and at Yale University (1905–07). Jones—called “Tad”—became Yale’s starting quarterback as a freshman and was named an All-American in 1907. He was an assistant coach at Yale in 1908, he coached at Syracuse University (1909–10), and, after coaching at preparatory schools (Pawling School and Exeter), he again coached at Yale in 1916. That year he earned his place in football lore when, before Yale’s game with traditional rival Harvard University, he declared to his players, “Gentlemen, you are now going to play football against Harvard. Never again in your whole life will you do anything so important.” During World War I, Jones worked in shipbuilding, after which he returned to coaching at Yale (1920–27), where he guided the 1923 team, considered the greatest in Yale football history, to a perfect record. His brother Howard Jones, an even more renowned collegiate football coach, won two national championships with the University of Southern California.
