Roger Staubach, in full Roger Thomas Staubach, byname Roger the Dodger,  (born February 5, 1942, Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.), American collegiate and professional gridiron football quarterback who was an important factor in the establishment of the National Football League (NFL) Dallas Cowboys as a dominant team in the 1970s.
Staubach played college football at the U.S. Naval Academy (1962–65), where as a quarterback he gained 4,253 yards (3,571 yards by passing) and scored 18 touchdowns. He was named All-American and won the Heisman Trophy as the best collegiate player in 1963. He served in the U.S. Navy (1965–69) following graduation from the academy.
During Staubach’s career with the Cowboys (1969–79), they were in the playoffs every year but one (1974) and played in four Super Bowl games, winning in the 1971 and 1977 seasons. Staubach led the league in passer rating in four seasons (1971, 1973, 1978–79). In his career, Staubach, known as “Captain Comeback,” rallied the Cowboys to victory in 14 games in which, with two minutes to play, they were either tied or losing. His wholesome image and professional demeanour, together with those of his coach, Tom Landry, were a major part of the Cowboy’s characterization as “America’s Team” in the 1970s. Staubach announced his retirement from football in 1979 and was briefly a sports announcer. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985. He later received the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2018).
