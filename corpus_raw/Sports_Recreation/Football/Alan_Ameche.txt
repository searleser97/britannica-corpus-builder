Alan Ameche, in full Alan Dante Ameche, byname The Horse,  (born June 1, 1933, Kenosha, Wisconsin, U.S.—died August 8, 1988, Houston, Texas), American gridiron football player known for scoring the decisive one-yard touchdown that gave the Baltimore Colts a 23–17 sudden-death victory over the New York Giants for the 1958 National Football League title, an iconic moment in what came to be known as “The Greatest Game Ever Played.”
Ameche, who set a national record (since broken) by rushing for 3,212 yards while playing at the University of Wisconsin, won the 1954 Heisman Trophy as the most outstanding player in college football. During his six seasons (1955–60) with the Colts, he was voted rookie of the year (1955), was named All Pro (1955–58), and played in four Pro Bowl games (1956, 1957, 1958, and 1959); an acute Achilles tendon injury ended his career. An excellent blocker and a powerful runner, Ameche was given the nickname “The Horse” for the way he worked on the practice field. During his professional career Ameche rushed for 4,045 yards in 964 carries for a 4.2-yard-per-carry average and scored 44 touchdowns. In 1975 he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.
