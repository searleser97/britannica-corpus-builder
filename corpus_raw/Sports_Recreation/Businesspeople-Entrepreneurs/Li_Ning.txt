Li took up gymnastics at age eight and joined the national team in 1980.

At the 1982 World Cup, he won the individual all-around gold medal while placing first in each discipline except the parallel bars. At the 1984 Olympics a slight error on the parallel bars cost Li the individual all-around title (he finished third), but he collected gold medals in the rings, floor exercise, and pommel horse and a silver medal in the vault. He also earned a silver medal in the team competition. Known in China as the “Prince of Gymnastics,” Li captured the individual all-around title at the 1986 World Cup championships.
After an ankle injury led to a poor performance at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Li retired from competition. After considering a career in coaching, he joined the Jianlibao Group and pursued business ventures. His Li-Ning sportswear products were top-sellers in China. Li also established an international gymnastics school in the United States. He was also a member of the Chinese Olympic committee.
