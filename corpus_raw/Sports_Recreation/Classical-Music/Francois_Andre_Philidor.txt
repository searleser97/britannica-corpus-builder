François-André Philidor, original name François-André Danican,  (born Sept. 7, 1726, Dreux, France—died Aug. 31, 1795, London, Eng.), French composer whose operas were successful and widely known in his day and who was a famous and remarkable chess player.
The last member of a large and prominent musical family, Philidor was thoroughly trained in music, but at age 18 he turned to chess competition throughout Europe after a canceled concert tour left him stranded in the Netherlands. He was particularly well received in England, where he published a book on chess and eventually received a pension from the London Chess Club. In 1754 he returned to Paris and set about composing highly popular operas, such as Sancho Pança dans son isle (1762) and Tom Jones (1765), as well as other dramatic and sacred music. He continued playing chess and composing for the remainder of his life, traveling regularly to London.
One of Philidor’s most famous wins, played at knight for pawn odds against Count Hans Bruhl, is annotated and viewable as
