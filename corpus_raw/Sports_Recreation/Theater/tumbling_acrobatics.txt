Tumbling,  execution of acrobatic movements such as rolls, twists, handsprings, or somersaults on floor mats or on the ground. Unlike most other disciplines in gymnastics, tumbling does not involve the use of apparatuses.
The activity dates back to ancient China, Egypt, and Greece. Tumbling was performed by traveling bands of entertainers in the European Middle Ages and later by circus and stage performers.
Once an international competitive sport, it has been superseded by Olympic gymnastics and has gravitated to high-school and age-group competition in the United States, Canada, and some European countries. Competition in the United States is governed by the Amateur Athletic Union.
A modern competitive routine consists of two to four passes, or “trips down the mat,” one of which must demonstrate backward moves and another forward moves. Tumblers may rest briefly between passes but may take no more than two minutes for the entire performance, including rests.
Although competitive activity has diminished, tumbling still enjoys worldwide popularity as a gymnastic developmental exercise and forms an integral element of gymnastic floor exercises.
