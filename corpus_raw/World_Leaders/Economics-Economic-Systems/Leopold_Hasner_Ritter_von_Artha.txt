Leopold Hasner, Ritter von Artha,  (born March 15, 1818, Prague—died  June 5, 1891, Bad Ischl, Austria), economist, jurist, and politician who served as liberal Austrian minister of education (1867–70) and briefly as prime minister (1870).
Educated in philosophy and law at Prague and Vienna, Hasner in 1848 became editor of an official newspaper in Prague—the Prager Zeitung. His liberal opinions, which favoured a centralized administration of the empire, won him the attention of the imperial government, and the minister of education, Leo, Graf von Thun und Hohenstein, secured him a position as university professor in legal philosophy at Prague (1849). Elected to the Bohemian provincial assembly, the Landtag, in 1861, he was subsequently sent to the Reichsrat, the national parliament, where he served in 1863 as president of the lower house.
In 1867 Hasner was named a life member of the upper house and the same year entered the Cabinet of Prince Carlos Auersperg as Austrian minister of education. His ministry introduced eight-year compulsory education and state control of primary education and imposed a nondenominational character on primary schools. During 1870, Hasner served briefly as prime minister, but his administration foundered amid the continuing conflicts of national minorities. Later, in the upper house, he devoted himself mainly to political–religious problems.
