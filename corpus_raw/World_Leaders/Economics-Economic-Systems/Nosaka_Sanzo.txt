Nosaka Sanzō,  (born March 30, 1892, Yamaguchi prefecture, Japan—died Nov. 14, 1993, Tokyo), politician who was the leading figure in the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) throughout the late 1950s and ’60s. He was responsible for the party’s pursuit of its revolutionary goals through peaceful participation in parliamentary politics.
Nosaka first became interested in Communism following the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. He graduated in 1917 from Keiō University, where as a student he had joined the Yūaikai, a labour organization formed by Suzuki Bunji. After studying in England, he joined the English Communist Party in 1920 and was deported a few months later. He returned to Japan in 1922 and played a major role in establishing the Japanese Communist Party. Arrested in 1923, he was released at the end of the year and became active in the Japanese labour movement. He was arrested again in 1928 as a result of mass arrests of Communists known as the March 15th Incident but was released because of ill health and went to the Soviet Union in 1931 as the JCP representative to the executive committee of the Comintern, the Soviet organization in charge of the international activities of the Communist Party. Under orders of the Comintern, Nosaka went to the United States twice in the 1930s to do underground work such as smuggling Communist tracts into Japan. In 1940 he went to the Chinese Communist liberated area in Yenan, where he engaged in propagandist activities against the Japanese army, which was then attempting to occupy China.
In 1946 Nosaka returned to Japan, where he was elected to the Central Committee of the reestablished Japanese Communist Party and was elected also to the Lower House of the Diet (parliament). As one of the major Japanese Communist theoreticians, he was blamed by the Cominform, the postwar equivalent of the Comintern, for his doctrine of peaceful evolution into Communism. When the U.S. occupation authorities purged Communists from Japanese politics during the 1950s Cold War era, Nosaka went underground to avoid arrest. In 1955 he reemerged as first secretary and leading figure of the Japanese Communist Party, calling for unity among Communists.
Nosaka was subsequently elected a member of the House of Councillors in 1956, a post that he held until 1977. He became chairman of the Central Committee of the party in 1958, retiring from that position in 1982 at the age of 90. Nosaka was dismissed as honorary chairman of the JCP in 1992 after party leaders claimed to have discovered documents indicating that in the late 1930s he had falsely denounced a Japanese Communist leader to the Soviet Union.
