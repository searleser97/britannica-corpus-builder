James Maitland, 8th earl of Lauderdale,  (born Jan. 26, 1759, Hatton (Haulton) House, Ratho parish, Midlothian, Scot.—died  Sept. 13, 1839, Thirlestane Castle, Berwickshire), Scottish politician and economic writer.
Lauderdale was educated at the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. He was elected to the House of Commons (1780, 1784) where, in spite of his abilities, he ran into difficulties due to his volatile temper. He pursued what was initially a radical career in Parliament and displayed sympathies with the French Revolution. After his succession to his father’s title, Lauderdale served sporadically in the House of Lords, where he became known for his unremitting hostility to various cabinets. In 1806 he was created Baron Lauderdale of Thirlestane. At this time, as a member of the Privy Council, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a peace treaty with France. Lauderdale was elected to the Order of the Thistle (1821), and from that time on, a marked conservatism pervaded his previously liberal politics. Lauderdale was the great-grandfather of Arthur Balfour, prime minister of Great Britain.
His chief work in economics was his Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Public Wealth (1804), in which, although basically adhering to the ideas of Adam Smith, he deviated from classical economists on a number of issues. In particular, he was a forerunner of Thomas Malthus in his belief in the possibility of oversaving and in concern about the level of aggregate demand. He rejected the distinction between productive and unproductive labour on the grounds that any labour which created utility was productive. He also felt that the national debt did not harm society but was merely a debt owed by one part to another.
