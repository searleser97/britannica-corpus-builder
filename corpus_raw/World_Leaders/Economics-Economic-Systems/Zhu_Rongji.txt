Zhu Rongji, Wade-Giles romanization Chu Jung-chi,  (born October 23, 1928, Changsha, Hunan province, China), Chinese politician who was a leading economic reformer in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He was premier of China from 1998 to 2003.
Zhu joined the CCP in 1949. Following his graduation (1951) from Tsinghua (Qinghua) University in Beijing with a degree in electrical engineering, he began work as a deputy division chief with the state planning commission. Though twice exiled to rural northwestern China because of his criticism of Mao Zedong’s economic policies, he eventually earned the favour of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and by 1987 had been appointed deputy party secretary of Shanghai. Zhu was named mayor of Shanghai in 1988 and improved the city’s economy by opening its doors to foreign investment. In 1989 he became Shanghai’s party secretary, and in 1991 Deng appointed him deputy premier. He emerged as a leader of economic reform in 1993 after putting himself in charge of the People’s Bank of China and creating a program that reduced the country’s inflation. Noted for his pragmatism and no-nonsense approach, Zhu was named premier on March 17, 1998.
As premier, Zhu embarked on a plan to reduce the size of government and reform the heavily indebted banking system and state-owned enterprises, as well as the housing and health care systems. He succeeded in cutting the size of government and the military by nearly one million people. Zhu made his first official visit to the United States in April 1999, hoping to improve bilateral relations and gain U.S. support for China’s efforts to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 2000 the U.S. Congress voted to eliminate the annual congressional review of China’s most-favoured-nation status, a move that helped China become a member of the WTO in 2001. Zhu, whose economic policies were both praised and criticized, stepped down as premier in 2003 and was replaced by Wen Jiabao.
