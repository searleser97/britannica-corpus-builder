Peter Fraser,   (born Aug. 28, 1884, Fearn, Ross, Scot.—died  Dec. 12, 1950, Wellington, N.Z.), statesman, labour leader, and prime minister (1940–49) whose leadership during World War II increased New Zealand’s international stature.
While working in London in 1908, Fraser joined the Independent Labour Party, but unemployment led him to emigrate to New Zealand in 1910, where he worked on the wharves in several ports and was active in union organizing in Auckland and in the harshly repressed Waihi and Wellington strikes of 1912–13. He helped organize the Social Democratic Party in 1913 and its successor, the Labour Party, in 1916. He was imprisoned for sedition (1916–17) when he opposed conscription for World War I.
In 1918 he entered Parliament, and soon became secretary of the Labour Party. When Labour came into power in 1935, he became minister of education, health, marine, and police. He was responsible for legislation that revised the educational system, especially at the secondary level, and for the Social Security Act (1938), which created a national health service and improved pensions.
Fraser succeeded Michael Joseph Savage as prime minister in 1940 and led the country’s mobilization for war. He won a voice for New Zealand in Allied military strategy in the Pacific and presided over a successful wartime price stabilization program organized by his minister of finance, Walter Nash. As one of the architects of the United Nations (1945) and a contributor to the UN Charter, Fraser was a spokesman for the rights of small nations, arguing unsuccessfully both against veto power for the great powers and for guaranteed aid to nations facing aggression.
Union unrest and discontent with economic controls and with Fraser’s legislation for peacetime conscription led to Labour’s defeat in 1949 after 15 years in office. Fraser then led the opposition in Parliament until his death the following year.
