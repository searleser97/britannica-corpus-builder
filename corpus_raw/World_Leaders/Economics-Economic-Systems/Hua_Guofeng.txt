Hua Guofeng, Wade-Giles romanization Hua Kuo-feng, original name Su Zhu,  (born February 16, 1921,  Jiaocheng, Shanxi province, China—died August 20, 2008, Beijing), premier of the People’s Republic of China from 1976 to 1980 and chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1976 to 1981.
Hua joined the CCP in 1938. After the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949, he became a local party secretary in Hunan province, the home province of Mao Zedong. He was transferred in 1952 to head the party apparatus in Xiangtan county in Hunan. Hua became vice governor of the province in 1958 and was a strong supporter of Mao in the Great Leap Forward (1958–60). During the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) he received Mao’s endorsement against rebel groups in Hunan, and he was active in setting up that province’s revolutionary committee in 1968 and in reestablishing its party committee in 1970. By late 1970 Hua had become the top man in Hunan province. He became a member of the State Council in 1971 and was later listed a member of the Politburo (Political Bureau) of CCP in 1973 and moved to Beijing, where he was named vice premier in 1975.
After the death of Premier Zhou Enlai in January 1976, Hua was named acting premier. In April—allegedly at the instigation of Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, and three of her political allies (the Gang of Four)—Mao chose Hua over his chief political rival, vice premier Deng Xiaoping, as permanent premier, and Deng was purged. Hua became chairman of the CCP after the death of Mao in September 1976. Known as an ideologically flexible leader, Hua had no strong ties either to the Maoist radicals or to Deng and the other pragmatists within the Communist Party. Although his unexpected rise to power had been seen as a compromise between the party factions led, respectively, by the Gang of Four and Deng Xiaoping, Hua ordered the arrest of the Gang of Four just days after Mao’s death. The influence of Deng triumphed soon afterward. In 1977 Hua allowed Deng to be rehabilitated and restored to his former position as vice premier. In 1980 Hua resigned the premiership to Zhao Ziyang, a follower of Deng, citing as his reason the CCP’s policy against officials holding high posts in both the party and the government. In June 1981 Hua was replaced as party chairman by Hu Yaobang, also a Deng supporter. Hua remained a member of Central Committee of the CCP until he resigned in 2002.
