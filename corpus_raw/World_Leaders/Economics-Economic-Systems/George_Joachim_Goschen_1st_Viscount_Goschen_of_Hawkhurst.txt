George Joachim Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen,  (born August 10, 1831, London—died February 7, 1907, Seacox Heath, Kent, England), British economist and administrator, who worked for both Liberal and Conservative governments in the late 19th century.
The son of William Henry Goeschen (or Göschen), a London banker of German origin, he was educated in Saxony, at Rugby, and at Oriel College, Oxford. He became prominent in the banking world early and was made a director of the Bank of England at 27. His Theory of the Foreign Exchanges (1861) was long famous.
Goschen entered Parliament in 1863 as a Liberal and made his mark at once in the House of Commons, becoming a junior minister in November 1865. In William Gladstone’s great Cabinet of 1868 Goschen was at first president of the Poor Law Board, where he projected useful reforms, and then, from March 1871 to February 1874, first lord of the Admiralty. He and the French negotiated (1876) with the khedive in Cairo the decree that established the dual Anglo-French control of Egyptian bonds.
Goschen stoutly opposed Benjamin Disraeli’s policy in the eastern crisis in 1876–78. He did not join Gladstone’s government in 1880 because he disapproved of the impending extension of the franchise, but he did accept the post of special ambassador to Constantinople and helped to settle various Balkan frontier questions in 1880–81. He found himself more and more at variance with progressive Liberals, and, when Gladstone declared for Irish Home Rule, Goschen opposed him vigorously. But he lost his seat in the election of July 1886 and only returned to the House of Commons in February 1887. When Lord Randolph Churchill resigned in December 1886, Goschen took his place as chancellor of the Exchequer (“I forgot Goschen,” said Churchill) and operated a successful conversion of the national debt in 1888. He was in opposition from 1892 to 1895, and returned to the Admiralty as first lord in Lord Salisbury’s coalition Cabinet (1895–1902), where he supervised large expansions of the fleet. He retired with a viscountcy in 1900.
