Samuel Smith,  (born July 27, 1752, Carlisle, Pa. [United States]—died  April 22, 1839, Baltimore, Md., U.S.), U.S. soldier and politician best known as the commander of land and sea forces that defended Baltimore from the British during the War of 1812.
Smith grew up in Baltimore, to which his family had moved in 1760. The son of a wealthy merchant, he joined the family business after lengthy travels in Europe.
Smith fought in the American Revolution, participating in the Battle of Long Island and spending the winter with George Washington at Valley Forge. As commander of Fort Mifflin, he helped prevent General William Howe’s fleet from coming to the aid of General John Burgoyne, contributing to the crucial American victory at Saratoga in 1777.
After the Revolution, Smith returned to Baltimore, where he became quite wealthy through land speculation as well as the family mercantile concerns. His main interest turned to politics. From 1793 to 1803 he won election four times to the U.S. House of Representatives, and from 1803 to 1815 he held a seat in the Senate.
During the British invasion of Maryland in 1814, Smith led about 13,000 troops in defending Baltimore. The Americans repulsed the invaders and inflicted heavy losses on them. The American-held citadel Fort McHenry withstood a two-day bombardment (inspiring Francis Scott Key to compose “The Star-Spangled Banner”) before the British finally withdrew.
In 1816 Smith returned to the House of Representatives where he stayed until once again moving over to the Senate in 1822. He held his Senate seat until 1833, marking 40 continuous years in Congress. Then in 1835—at the age of 83—he took command of the state militia and put down riots in Baltimore. The grateful city elected Smith mayor, and he served in that capacity until 1838, one year before his death.
