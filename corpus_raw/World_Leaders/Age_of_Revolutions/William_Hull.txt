William Hull,  (born June 24, 1753, Derby, Conn. [U.S.]—died  Nov. 29, 1825, Newton, Mass., U.S.), U.S. soldier and civil governor of Michigan Territory (including present Michigan, Wisconsin, and part of Minnesota) who was the subject of a celebrated court martial.
A graduate of Yale College, Hull joined the American army during the Revolutionary War, serving in campaigns in Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey. Both before and after the war he practiced law, and in 1805 President Thomas Jefferson named him governor of Michigan Territory. In 1812, at the outset of the war with Great Britain, he accepted a commission as brigadier general, in command of an army intended to defend Michigan and attack Canada. His invasion of Canada was clumsy and poorly planned; he retreated to Detroit and eventually, on Aug. 16, 1812, without a fight, surrendered his army and forts to the British.
A court martial later convicted him of cowardice and neglect of duty and sentenced him to death. President James Madison approved the findings but remitted the sentence. Hull’s surrender was a severe blow to American morale during the remaining two years of war.
