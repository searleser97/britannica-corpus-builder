Theodor Körner,  (born April 24, 1873, Komárno, Hung.—died  Jan. 4, 1957, Vienna), Austrian military officer during World War I and later a statesman who served as president of the second Austrian republic (1951–57).
A colonel in the Austro-Hungarian Army at the outbreak of World War I, Körner was subsequently appointed chief of staff (May 1915) and successfully helped to stem Italian offensives along the Italian-Slovenian border. Appointed inspector general of the new Austrian Army after the fall of the empire in November 1918, he retired two years later, joined the Social Democratic Party, and, between 1925 and 1934, sat as a delegate for Vienna in the Austrian Bundesrat (upper chamber in the federal parliament). During the early 1930s, as military adviser for the Schutzbund—a Socialist paramilitary organization—Körner steadily counseled against violent action despite the increasingly rightward drift of Austrian politics. He was nonetheless imprisoned after the Socialist rising of February 1934 for his Schutzbund activities.
Having resisted participation in Nazi politics after the Anschluss (incorporation of Austria into the German Reich, March 1938), he was, at the end of World War II, appointed mayor of Vienna by the Soviet occupation authorities. In May 1951 he was elected president of the second Austrian republic; he died in office.
