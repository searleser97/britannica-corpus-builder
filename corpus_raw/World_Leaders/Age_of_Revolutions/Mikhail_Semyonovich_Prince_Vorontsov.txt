Mikhail Semyonovich, Prince Vorontsov,  (born May 19 [May 30, New Style], 1782—died  November 6 [November 18], 1856, Odessa, Ukraine, Russian Empire), Russian military and government official who was an outstanding imperial administrator.
The son of the diplomat Semyon R. Vorontsov, he was born into a family that had become highly influential in Russian political affairs in the 18th century. He entered the Russian army in 1801 and participated in Russia’s campaign against Napoleonic France (1806–15). He was a lieutenant general by 1813, and he commanded Russia’s occupation forces in France in 1815–18. In 1823 he was appointed governor-general of a sparsely populated frontier area that included Crimea, Bessarabia, and the town of Odessa. During his long tenure in this post (1823–54), Vorontsov built up an honest and efficient administration, and he also discouraged serfdom from spreading into his territories with the influx of Russian settlers. He greatly facilitated the growth of trade and industry in the region, besides establishing schools and other cultural institutions.
In 1844 Vorontsov was appointed commander in chief and governor of the Caucasus, and he succeeded in solidifying Russia’s tenuous hold over that territory. By 1848 he had also brought two-thirds of Dagestan (a region in the eastern Caucasus) under Russian control. Vorontsov favoured the introduction of moderate reforms in Russia, including the emancipation of the serfs. He retired in 1853 and was made a field marshal in 1856.
