Adolphe Niel,  (born Oct. 4, 1802, Muret, France—died  Aug. 13, 1869, Paris), French army officer and marshal who, as minister of war, made an unsuccessful attempt to reorganize the French army in 1868.
Niel was trained as an engineer and spent most of his life in military service after receiving his commission in 1825. In 1849 he distinguished himself in the French forces’ capture of Rome from the republicans. Appointed a general of division in 1853, he twice commanded the engineers during the Crimean War. The next year he became an aide-de-camp to Napoleon III, and in 1857 he was made a senator. He went to Turin in January 1859 to help conclude the alliance between France and Sardinia-Piedmont, and in the ensuing war against Austria he played a decisive role in the Battle of Solferino, for which he was made a marshal the next day (June 25, 1859). After Niel was appointed minister of war on Jan. 18, 1867, he planned a radical reorganization of the French army, but he met with obstruction and did not live long enough to put his program into effect.
