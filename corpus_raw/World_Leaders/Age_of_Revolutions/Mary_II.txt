Mary II,  (born April 30, 1662, London, England—died December 28, 1694, London), queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1689–94) and wife of King William III. As the daughter of King James II, she made it possible for her Dutch husband to become coruler of England after he overthrew James’s government.
Although her father and mother were converts to Roman Catholicism, Mary was brought up a Protestant. In November 1677 she married her cousin William of Orange, stadholder of the United Provinces of the Netherlands and champion of Protestantism in Europe. She then settled in Holland. Her inability to bear children and William’s infidelity made the early years of her marriage unhappy, but eventually they became a devoted couple.
During the quarrel (1687–88) between James II and William over James’s pro-Catholic policies, Mary felt it her religious duty to side with her husband. Hence, she agreed to support William’s invasion of England in November 1688. James fled the country in December, and two months later Mary arrived in London. At once Mary rejected proposals, advanced particularly by the earl of Danby, that she become sole ruler to the exclusion of her husband, and on April 11, 1689, she and William were crowned joint sovereigns of England, Scotland, and Ireland. While her husband was directing military campaigns in Ireland and on the Continent, Mary administered the government in her own name, but she relied entirely on his advice. In the periods when William was in England she willingly retired from politics. She was, however, actively concerned with ecclesiastical appointments.
Mary enjoyed great popularity, and her Dutch tastes had a marked influence on English pottery, landscape gardening, and interior decoration. She never settled down happily to life in England, however, and continued to be deeply troubled by her estrangement from her deposed father. Mary died of smallpox at the age of 32.
