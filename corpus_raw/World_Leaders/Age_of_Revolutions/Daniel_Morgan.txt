Daniel Morgan,  (born 1736, Hunterdon county, New Jersey [U.S.]—died  July 6, 1802, Winchester, Virginia, U.S.), general in the American Revolution (1775–83) who won an important victory against the British at the Battle of Cowpens (January 17, 1781).
After moving to Virginia in 1753, Morgan was commissioned a captain of Virginia riflemen at the outbreak of the Revolution. During the following winter, he accompanied General Benedict Arnold to Canada, and in the assault on Quebec (December 31) he and his riflemen penetrated well into the city, where he was hemmed in and forced to surrender. Late in 1776 he was released, and in September 1777 he joined General Horatio Gates and took part in both Battles of Saratoga (New York) that fall.
Partly because of ill health, Morgan resigned from the army in 1779, but after the disastrous American defeat at the Battle of Camden, South Carolina (1780), he agreed to join Gates at Hillsborough, North Carolina, where he took command of a corps and was made brigadier general. Aiming at slowing Lord Cornwallis’s advance in the South, Morgan gradually retired northward and then turned suddenly to confront the British troops at Cowpens, where he won a brilliant and unexpected victory over a larger force under Colonel Banastre Tarleton.
In 1794 Morgan led Virginia militiamen into western Pennsylvania to help suppress the Whiskey Rebellion. He was a Federalist representative in Congress from 1797 to 1799.
