Jean-Baptiste Drouet, count d’Erlon,  (born July 29, 1765, Reims, Fr.—died  Jan. 25, 1844, Paris), French soldier whose long career raised him from the ranks of both Louis XVI’s and Napoleon’s armies to be the first governor-general of Algeria and a marshal of France under Louis-Philippe.
A volunteer in the regiment of Beaujolais from 1782, Drouet had reached the rank of corporal in 1792, before the fall of the monarchy. Elected captain in 1793, he became aide-de-camp to General P. Lefebvre in 1794 and thenceforward enjoyed rapid promotion. General of division in 1803, he was created count d’Erlon by Napoleon in January 1809. He served in Bavaria and Spain and was promoted lieutenant general in 1813. Under the first Restoration he was made commander of the 16th military division but conspired against the regime. Joining Napoleon during the Hundred Days in 1815, he was made a peer of France and given command of an army corps, but in the Waterloo campaign he spent June 16 between Ney at Quatre-Bras and Napoleon at Ligny and failed to support either as required.
On the second Restoration, Drouet fled to Bavaria, where, as Baron Schmidt, under King Maximilian I’s protection, he set up a brewery near Munich. The death sentence passed on him in France in 1816, was, however, canceled in 1825. Returning to France in 1830, he was reinstated on the active list by the regime of Louis-Philippe.
In July 1834 Drouet was appointed governor-general of Algeria. Ignorant of the country, he at first let himself be guided by his chief-of-staff, General C.A. Trézel, but on Trézel’s being posted to Oran he fell under the influence of a scheming emissary of Abdelkadar (ʿAbd al-Qādir). He disavowed Trézel after the latter’s defeat by Abdelkadar at La Macta. Drouet was recalled to France in July 1835. After some years at Nantes, he was made marshal of France in April 1843.
