Marthinus Theunis Steyn,  (born Oct. 2, 1857, Rietfontein, Orange Free State [now in South Africa]—died  Nov. 28, 1916, Bloemfontein), leader of the Orange Free State and its Afrikaner nationalist president before and during the South African War (1899–1902).
Steyn, educated at Grey College in Bloemfontein and at Deventer, Neth., became state attorney and was appointed to the high court of the Orange Free State in 1889. After winning the presidential election of February 1896, Steyn pursued a policy of economic independence and of protecting the Dutch language against English-speaking immigrant influences. In foreign affairs he worked toward a Free State–Transvaal alliance, which was concluded in 1897. In an effort to prevent a conflict between Britain and the Transvaal, Steyn in May–June 1899 was host to the unsuccessful Bloemfontein Conference between Paul Kruger, Transvaal’s president, and Alfred Milner, the British commissioner. Not until September did he give his Transvaal ally full support; in October he joined in the South African War; and in November he sent his commandos across the Orange River to attack the Cape Colony and to try to provoke a Cape Afrikaner rebellion against the British. When British troops took Bloemfontein in March 1900, Steyn fought on as a guerrilla leader. Poor health prevented his signing the formal surrender at Pretoria on May 31, 1902 (Peace of Vereeniging).
The war so shattered Steyn’s health that he never again held office. Idolized by the people, the former president became a behind-the-scenes power and resisted the program of conciliation put forth by Louis Botha, premier of the Transvaal.
