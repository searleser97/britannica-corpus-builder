St. Helena, also called Helen,  (born c. 248, Drepanon?, Bithynia, Asia Minor—died c. 328, Nicomedia; Western feast day August 18; Eastern feast day [with Constantine] May 21), Roman empress who was the reputed discoverer of Christ’s cross. (See also True Cross.)
Helena was married to the Roman emperor Constantius I Chlorus, who renounced her for political reasons. When her son Constantine I the Great became emperor at York in 306, he made her empress dowager, and under his influence she later became a Christian. She was devoted to her eldest grandson, Crispus Caesar, whom Constantine made titular ruler of Gaul, but a mysterious embroilment in the imperial family culminated with the execution of Crispus and Fausta, Constantine’s second wife and Crispus’s stepmother. Thereafter, the story became current that Fausta had accused Crispus of attempting to seduce her—hence Crispus’s execution in 326. Fausta, in turn, was denounced by the grief-stricken Helena and was executed shortly afterward. The historicity of that explanation remains questionable. Immediately after the double tragedy, Helena made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. She caused churches to be built on the reputed sites of Christ’s Nativity (in Bethlehem) and Ascension (near Jerusalem).
Before 337 it was claimed in Jerusalem that Christ’s cross had been found during the building of Constantine’s church on Golgotha, under a temple of Venus that had been demolished at the site. Later in the century Helena was credited with the discovery. Many subsequent legends developed, and the story of the “invention,” or the finding of the cross, enhanced by romances and confusions with other Helens, became a favourite throughout Christendom. The story was told again in Cynewulf’s 9th-century poem Elene.
