Damrong Rajanubhab,  (born June 21, 1862—died  Dec. 1, 1943, Bangkok, Thailand), Thai prince, son of King Mongkut and brother of King Chulalongkorn. He was the founder of modern education and provincial administration and was Thailand’s leading intellectual of his generation.
Damrong himself had only four years of formal education in short-lived palace Thai and English schools founded by King Chulalongkorn for his brothers in the early 1870s. Following this schooling he joined the Royal Pages’ Bodyguard Regiment to prepare for a military career. When he became head of the regiment in 1880, at the age of 18, he found that the sons of royalty and nobility passing through the pages’ corps were being ill-prepared for military and bureaucratic careers and so founded Suan Kulap (Rose Garden Palace) School in 1881. In 1885 an education department was created under Damrong’s control, which in 1887 was made a separate department of government and in 1892 a ministry.
Damrong was slated to become the minister of education in 1892 but instead, because of his exceptional ability, was appointed minister of interior, the most powerful position in the bureaucracy. He modernized what had been a decentralized system of provincial administration by grouping almost 100 provinces into only 14 “circles,” each staffed by modern-educated young officers and royal commissioners, thus quickly ending provincial autonomy. Damrong’s officers collected taxes, controlled leasing for the extraction of natural resources, and introduced modern law and education.
After being encouraged to resign by his young nephew King Vajiravudh in 1915, Damrong turned his energies to scholarship. He took a leading role in preserving and publishing the traditional texts of Thai literature and history, and he was one of the founders of the Siam Society and the National Library. Damrong went into exile in Pinang after the 1932 revolution. He was the author of more than 1,000 books and articles in various fields.
