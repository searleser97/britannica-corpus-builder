Chester Bowles, in full Chester Bliss Bowles,  (born April 5, 1901, Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.—died May 25, 1986, Sussex, Connecticut), American advertising entrepreneur, public official, and noted liberal politician.
After graduating from Yale University in 1924, Bowles worked for a year as a reporter and then took a job in 1925 as an advertising copywriter. With William Benton he established the successful advertising company of Benton and Bowles in 1929, selling his multimillion-dollar interest in it in 1941, when he took a position in the state wartime rationing administration under the governor of Connecticut. He became that state’s director of price administration and in the autumn of 1943 was appointed general manager of the Federal Price Administration by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He then served under President Harry S. Truman as director of the Office of Economic Stabilization from February to July 1946. In 1946 he failed to win the Democratic nomination for governor of Connecticut. He was an American delegate to the first conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and later served as a special assistant to the UN secretary-general in 1947–48.
Bowles was elected governor of Connecticut in 1948, but his liberal stands on civil rights and other issues caused him to be defeated for reelection in 1950. In 1951 he was appointed ambassador to India and Nepal by President Truman and served until 1953, when he was elected to the House of Representatives from Connecticut. He served three terms, and in 1961 President John F. Kennedy appointed him undersecretary of state. In 1963 he was reappointed ambassador to India, holding the post until 1969. His publications include The New Dimensions of Peace (1955), Africa’s Challenge to America (1956), The Coming Political Breakthrough (1959), The Conscience of a Liberal (1962), and Promises to Keep: My Years in Public Life (1971).
