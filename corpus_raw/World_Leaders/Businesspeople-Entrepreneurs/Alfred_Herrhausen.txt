Alfred Herrhausen,  (born Jan. 30, 1930, Essen, Ger.—died  Nov. 30, 1989, Bad Homburg, W.Ger.), West German captain of industry, chairman of the country’s largest commercial bank (Deutsche Bank).
Herrhausen launched his career as an assistant manager with the utility Ruhrgas in his native city (1952–55). After receiving a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Cologne (1955), he joined the regional utility company in Dortmund, where he distinguished himself by planning its privatization (1966); he was made financial director the following year. He joined Deutsche Bank as a deputy board member (1970) and later became joint chairman (1985) and chairman (1988). Seeking to expand the influence of the bank, he led it into such ventures as management consultation and real estate.
Herrhausen, considered to be a key advisor to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, served on the boards of such companies as Daimler-Benz AG, Continental Gummi-werke AG, the Xerox Corporation, and various electric utilities. His opinions on easing Third World debt, supporting the economies of emerging eastern European countries, and reunifying Germany reportedly made him a target of terrorists; he and his family lived under heavy security. A small terrorist group known as the Red Army Faction took credit for his assassination, a bombing death which occurred when remote-control explosives wired to a bicycle destroyed Herrhausen’s armoured car as he was being driven to work.
