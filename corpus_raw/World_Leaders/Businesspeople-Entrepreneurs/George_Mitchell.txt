George Mitchell, in full George John Mitchell,  (born Aug. 20, 1933, Waterville, Maine, U.S.), American politician and diplomat who served as a member of the U.S. Senate (1980–95), including service as majority leader (1989–95), and who later was special adviser to the peace process in Northern Ireland under U.S. Pres. Bill Clinton (1995–2000) and was special envoy to the Middle East under Pres. Barack Obama (2009–11).
Mitchell earned a B.A. from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine (1954), before enlisting in the U.S. Army, where he served as a counterintelligence officer in Berlin. After completing his service in 1956, he returned to the United States and earned a law degree from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. (1960). Mitchell remained in Washington, working as an attorney for the Department of Justice’s antitrust division (1960–62) and as an assistant to U.S. Sen. Edmund Muskie (1962–65). Mitchell left Washington to work for a law firm in Maine, but he maintained his political ties. He chaired the Maine Democratic Party (1966–68) and worked on Muskie’s 1968 vice-presidential campaign, as well as Muskie’s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination four years later. Mitchell ran for governor of Maine in 1974 but was narrowly defeated by independent candidate James Longley. In 1977 Mitchell was named U.S. attorney for Maine, a position he held until he was appointed to the U.S. district court of Maine by Pres. Jimmy Carter in 1979.
When Muskie was named secretary of state in 1980, Mitchell was chosen to complete the final two years of Muskie’s term in the Senate. He won the seat outright in 1982 and rose to national prominence in 1987 with his incisive criticism of Oliver North at the Senate hearings over the Iran-Contra Affair. The following year Mitchell was elected Senate majority leader, and he assumed that role when the 101st Congress began its session in January 1989. A moderate liberal on most issues, he was respected by lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle. In 1994 Mitchell was offered the U.S. Supreme Court seat vacated by retiring justice Harry A. Blackmun, but he declined the nomination, stating that he wished to devote his time to health care reform. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1995.
In late 1995 Mitchell accepted a position as special adviser to Pres. Bill Clinton on the conflict in Northern Ireland. Over the next five years, Mitchell crossed the Atlantic more than 100 times, mediating a conclusion to the hostilities that had plagued the region for generations. His work culminated in the Good Friday Agreement (Belfast Agreement) of 1998 and, ultimately, the decommissioning of the Irish Republican Army. For his efforts, Mitchell in 1999 received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the UNESCO Peace Prize, and an honorary knighthood in the Order of the British Empire. In 2000 he was selected to chair an international committee on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The group’s analysis, completed in 2001, called for concessions from both sides, and it provided a framework for future negotiations.
Mitchell lent his diplomatic skills to the corporate sphere, where, as chairman of the Disney Company (2004–07), he averted a stockholder rebellion and helped guide the entertainment giant through a contentious leadership transition. In 2006 Bud Selig, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, asked him to lead an investigation of the illegal use of performance-enhancing drugs by players. Mitchell’s report, issued in December 2007, stated that drug abuse was pervasive throughout the league, and it identified 89 current and former players, including marquee names such as Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens, as users of banned substances. The report led to the creation of a permanent substance-abuse investigations department within Major League Baseball.
Mitchell returned to public service in January 2009, when Pres. Barack Obama named him special envoy to the Middle East. His efforts to negotiate a peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians were unsuccessful, however, as hostilities between the two sides appeared to increase. In May 2011 Mitchell stepped down from his post.
