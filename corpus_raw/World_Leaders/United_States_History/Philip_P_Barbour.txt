Philip P. Barbour, in full Philip Pendleton Barbour,  (born May 25, 1783, Barboursville, Virginia, U.S.—died February 25, 1841, Washington, D.C.), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1836–41) and political figure known for his advocacy of states’ rights and strict construction of the U.S. Constitution.
Barbour practiced law in Virginia from 1802 until he was elected to the state’s House of Delegates in 1812. Two years later he was sent to Congress. He served as speaker from 1821 to 1823, when he was defeated for the office by Henry Clay, and he then accepted an appointment to the General Court of Virginia (1825–27). Barbour opposed the nationalistic policies of Clay and John C. Calhoun, including the tariff, internal improvements, and the extension of federal jurisdiction by the Supreme Court, and he fought to protect Virginia from federal encroachments. In 1827 he briefly returned to Congress to continue this battle and in 1829 took the place of the ailing James Monroe as president of the Virginia constitutional convention.
In 1830 Pres. Andrew Jackson appointed Barbour a federal district judge in Virginia, and in 1836, when Roger B. Taney became the chief justice, Barbour succeeded Justice Gabriel Duvall on the U.S. Supreme Court. His only major opinion was in City of New York v. Miln (1837), which upheld states’ jurisdiction over certain commercial activities. Barbour was part of the post-John Marshall majority, led by Taney, which began to shift the emphasis of the court away from nationalism and liberal construction. Although highly regarded for his scholarship, Barbour did not serve long enough to have a great influence on the court’s direction.
