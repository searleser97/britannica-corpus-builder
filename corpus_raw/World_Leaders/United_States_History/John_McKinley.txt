John McKinley,  (born May 1, 1780, Culpeper County, Va., U.S.—died  July 19, 1852, Louisville, Ky.), American politician and associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1837–52).
After practicing law briefly in Kentucky, where he grew up, McKinley settled in Huntsville, Alabama, then a centre of planting and political interests, in 1818. In 1820 he was elected to the Alabama state legislature and two years later, despite the support of the Georgia political machine, was defeated by one vote for the U.S. Senate. Having become a supporter of Jacksonian Democracy, he secured the Senate seat four years later, served one term, and returned to the state legislature after failing reelection. McKinley remained loyal to the Andrew Jackson forces in succeeding electoral contests and in 1837 was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by Pres. Martin Van Buren. He served on the court for the rest of his life and attended his duties despite increasing enfeeblement in his later years.
