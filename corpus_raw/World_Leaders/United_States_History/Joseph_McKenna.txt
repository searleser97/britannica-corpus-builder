Joseph McKenna,  (born Aug. 10, 1843, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  Nov. 21, 1926, Washington, D.C.), U.S. Supreme Court justice from 1898 to 1925.
McKenna grew up in California and was admitted to the state bar in 1865. A Republican, he served as Solano county district attorney (1866–70) and in the California state legislature (1875–76). Despite the prevailing anti-Roman Catholic sentiments that contributed to two defeats at the polls, McKenna was elected in his third Congressional bid to the U.S. House of Representatives (1885–92).
In 1892 President Benjamin Harrison named him to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court. President William McKinley called McKenna back to Washington in 1897 to join his cabinet as attorney general; later that year the president nominated him to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The nomination was confirmed early in 1898 despite widespread complaints that McKenna’s record on the circuit court had been undistinguished. During his 27 years on the Supreme Court bench, McKenna was considered a diligent but not otherwise notable justice.
