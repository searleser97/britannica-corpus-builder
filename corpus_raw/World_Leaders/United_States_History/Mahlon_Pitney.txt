Mahlon Pitney,  (born February 5, 1858, Morristown, New Jersey, U.S.—died December 9, 1924, Washington, D.C.), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1912–22).
After graduating from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), Pitney studied law with his father and took over his father’s practice when the latter was appointed vice chancellor of New Jersey in 1889. In 1894 Pitney was elected to the U.S. Congress, in which he served until 1899, followed by a term in the New Jersey state Senate and, in 1901, an appointment to the state Supreme Court. In 1908 he became the state’s chancellor. In 1912 Pres. William Howard Taft named Pitney to the U.S. Supreme Court to succeed John Marshall Harlan, Sr.
Pitney’s opinions were characterized by his conservative interpretations and meticulous care. He made his most important contributions in the area of labour law. His opinions in Hitchman Coal and Coke Co. v. Mitchell (1917) and Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering (1921), which limited the rights of workers to collective bargaining, were elaborations of his earlier opinion in Coppage v. Kansas, in which the court struck down a Kansas statute prohibiting an employer from preventing union membership among his employees by force or coercion. Another memorable opinion, in Frank v. Mangum, drew vigorous dissent from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes on the grounds that it validated mob law. Pitney resigned from the court on December 31, 1922.
