Ozaki Yukio,  (born Dec. 24, 1858, Kanagawa, Sagami province, Japan—died  Oct. 6, 1954, Zushi, Kanagawa prefecture), noted democratic politician who was elected to the Japanese House of Representatives a total of 25 times and is considered the “father of parliamentary politics” in that country.
Originally a journalist, Ozaki joined the government as a follower of the politician and later prime minister Ōkuma Shigenobu. When Ōkuma resigned in 1881 owing to the cabinet’s failure to adopt his radical proposals for the creation of a new constitution, Ozaki followed him into opposition. In 1898 Ozaki was back in the government, as education minister in the new, and short-lived, Ōkuma cabinet. He was forced to resign, however, after a slip of the tongue in which he referred to the imperial Japanese state as a republic. From 1903 to 1912 he was mayor of Tokyo, and in 1912 he led the rank-and-file members of the Friends of Constitutional Government (Rikken Seiyūkai) party into the streets to rally popular support against the oligarchical cabinet of the former general Katsura Tarō. Within a few months the movement that Ozaki had helped form led to the fall of Katsura’s government and the gradual creation of a cabinet responsible to the majority party in the Japanese Diet, or parliament.
In 1915, while serving as minister of justice in Ōkuma’s second cabinet, Ozaki denounced the bribery and corruption carried on by Ōkuma during the election. He thereafter refused to affiliate with any faction or party but remained until his death a powerful force, always fighting for the expansion of democratic politics in Japan. He was especially active in the struggle for universal manhood suffrage, which was established in 1925.
