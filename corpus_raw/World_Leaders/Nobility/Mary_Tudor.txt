Mary Tudor,  (born March 1495/96—died June 24, 1533, Westhorpe, Suffolk, Eng.), English princess, the third wife of King Louis XII of France; she was the sister of England’s King Henry VIII (ruled 1509–47) and the grandmother of Lady Jane Grey, who was titular queen of England for nine days in 1553.
Mary’s father, King Henry VII (ruled 1485–1509) betrothed her to Archduke Charles (later the Holy Roman emperor Charles V) in 1507. In 1514, however, political considerations caused King Henry VIII to renounce this engagement and arrange a match between his beautiful, charming sister, Mary, and Louis XII, a broken man of 52. Since Mary was already in love with Charles Brandon, 1st duke of Suffolk, she made Henry promise that after Louis died she would be allowed to wed the man of her choice.
The marriage with Louis took place on Oct. 9, 1514, and Mary treated her husband with affection until he died on January 1 of the following year. Before Henry or Louis’s successor, King Francis I, could involve her in another political marriage, Mary secretly wed Suffolk in Paris, probably in late February. Henry was infuriated at the news, but Suffolk regained the king’s favour by paying him a large sum of money and perhaps by the intercession of Cardinal Wolsey. One of Mary’s daughters by Suffolk became the mother of Lady Jane Grey.
