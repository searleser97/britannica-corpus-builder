Milan IV (or II), in full Milan Obrenović,  (born Aug. 22 [Aug. 10, Old Style], 1854, Maraşeşti, Moldavia—died  Feb. 11 [Jan. 29], 1901, Vienna), prince (1868–82) and then king (1882–89) of Serbia.
Succeeding his cousin Prince Michael III of Serbia on July 2, 1868, Milan was dominated during the first years of his reign by a regency that adopted a seemingly liberal constitution in 1869, tried to develop close relations with Austria, and made Milan generally unpopular. When Milan assumed personal control of the government (August 1872), however, he further alienated public opinion by his frivolous extravagance; by his unfaithfulness to his wife, the Russian-born Natalie Petrovna Keshko, whom he married in 1875; and by his refusal to accommodate the pan-Slavist sentiments of his subjects or support the rebels of Bosnia-Hercegovina, who rose against their Ottoman Turkish rulers in 1875. Only when threatened with a revolution did he abandon his policy of neutrality and declare war on the Turks (June 30, 1876). Although the Serbs were quickly defeated, their situation was saved by the subsequent Russian victory over the Turks (Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78). Ultimately, the Treaty of Berlin not only enlarged Serbia’s territory but also recognized it as a completely independent state (1878).
In order to acquire such concessions at the peace conference, Milan’s representatives had been obliged to rely on Austria, which demanded in return that Serbia link its railroads, as well as its economy, with Austria’s. Although many Serb political figures preferred to develop close relations with Russia rather than with Austria, Milan favoured the pro-Austrian policy: he appointed pro-Austrian ministers, concluded trade and tariff agreements that made Serbia’s economy dependent on Austria’s, and secretly pledged to conclude no treaties with other governments without Austria’s approval (1881).
Subsequently, Austria supported Milan when he proclaimed himself king and declared the principality of Serbia a kingdom (1882). In 1883, with his army, he quelled a large peasant uprising led by radicals in eastern Serbia.
After Milan declared war on Bulgaria in 1885 and suffered another major military defeat, Austria extended diplomatic aid and arranged for peace to be concluded on the basis of status quo ante bellum. Milan’s dependence upon Austria aggravated domestic discontent, which he tried to assuage by granting a more liberal constitution in January 1889. In March, however, Milan was compelled to abdicate in favour of his son Alexander.
Having divorced Natalie in October 1888, Milan renounced his Serb nationality in 1892 and settled in Paris as the Count of Takovo. In 1897 he returned to Serbia to serve as his son’s commander in chief. Although he instituted beneficial reforms in the army, he remained unpopular; and when Alexander married against the advice of his father and his chief ministers, Milan went permanently into exile (1900).
