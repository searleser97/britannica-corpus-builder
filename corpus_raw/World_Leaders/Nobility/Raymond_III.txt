Raymond III,   (born c. 1140—died  July 1187, County of Tripoli), count of the crusaders’ state of Tripoli (1152–87) and twice regent of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (1174–77, 1184–85).
Raymond succeeded to the countship after the assassination of his father, Raymond II, in 1152. In his campaigns against the Muslims he was taken prisoner by their leader Nureddin in 1164 but was released in 1172. When the new king of Jerusalem, Baldwin IV, took the throne in 1174, Raymond successfully claimed the regency as the first cousin once removed of Baldwin, a minor and a leper. The regency ended when Baldwin came of age (1177), but Raymond continued to take an active part in the kingdom’s affairs.
Raymond’s rivals soon induced Baldwin to exile him for two years (1180–82). The growing threat from the Muslim leader Saladin, however, finally led to the designation of Raymond (early in 1184) as regent again for the dying Baldwin’s infant nephew, who had been crowned king (1183). There was a proviso, however, that if the new king, Baldwin V, should die prematurely, the succession should be determined by the pope, the Holy Roman emperor, and the kings of England and France. When Baldwin IV died in March 1185, Raymond immediately concluded a four-year truce with Saladin.
When Baldwin V died in the summer of 1186, his mother Sibyl and her husband Guy of Lusignan took the throne in violation of the proviso of the regency. Refusing to acknowledge Guy, Raymond withdrew to Tiberias (on the sea of Galilee), a stronghold belonging to his wife Eschiva of Bures, princess of Galilee. When Saladin resumed war against the kingdom, Raymond at first maintained a separate truce. Finally, however, the slaughter of some of Guy’s supporters in the Galilee area by Muslims to whom Raymond had granted a safe conduct impelled Raymond to a reconciliation with Guy. Raymond was wounded in the Battle of the Horns of Ḥaṭṭin (July 4, 1187), after which he retired to Tripoli and died shortly thereafter.
