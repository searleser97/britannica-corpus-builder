Marie-Anne de la Trémoille, princess des Ursins,  (born 1642, Paris, Fr.—died Dec. 5, 1722, Rome, Papal States [Italy]), French noblewoman who exercised great influence in the government of Spain between 1701 and 1714, during the period of the War of the Spanish Succession.
Ursins moved to Italy with her first husband, and after his death she married an Italian duke, who died in 1698. She remained in Rome until 1701, where her salon became a centre of French influence in Italy.
After Ursins helped arrange the marriage of Philip V of Spain, grandson of Louis XIV of France, to María Luisa of Savoy, Louis sent her to Spain to be the queen’s camarera mayor (principal lady of the bedchamber). She soon established a complete ascendancy over María Luisa, who, in turn, ruled Philip. Until 1714 it was, in effect, the princess who decided Spanish policy. Her influence was greatest in 1713 and 1714, when, with the French economist Jean Orry as de facto first minister, a complete reform of the Spanish administration was begun. Attempts by the princess to secure for herself an independent principality in Luxembourg almost caused the breakdown in 1713 of the peace negotiations at Utrecht that ended the War of the Spanish Succession.
After the death of María Luisa in February 1714, Ursins arranged for Philip to marry Isabella Farnese. The new queen, however, warned of the authority exercised by the princess, picked a quarrel with her at their first meeting (Dec. 23, 1714), and immediately exiled her from Spain. Ursins retired to Rome.
