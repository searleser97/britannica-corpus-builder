Nicholas I, Montenegrin in full Nikola Petrović,  (born October 7 [September 25, Old Style], 1841, Njeguši, Montenegro—died March 2, 1921, Antibes, France), prince (1860–1910) and then king (1910–18) of Montenegro, who transformed his small principality into a sovereign European nation.
Heir presumptive to his uncle Danilo II, who was childless, Nicholas came to the throne in August 1860 after Danilo’s assassination. Educated abroad in Paris and Trieste, he was throughout his reign faced with the difficult task of popularizing Western ways. A strong prince and an outstanding leader, he fought the Turks in 1862 and again in 1876, when he conducted a brilliant campaign. At the Congress of Berlin (1878), Montenegro was doubled in size, with an outlet to the Adriatic, and recognized as a sovereign state. Alexander II of Russia, whose friendship with Nicholas dated back to a state visit to St. Petersburg in 1868, supplied him regularly with money and arms and at one point favoured his candidacy for the Serbian throne. A clever diplomat, Nicholas strengthened his dynastic connections through the marriages of his daughters: Elena married (1896) the future king of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III; Zorka married Peter Karadjordjević (1883) but died before he became king of Serbia; two other daughters married Russian grand dukes. In Balkan politics Nicholas conspired, sometimes with, and sometimes against, Serbian rulers, to create a South Slav state.
Styling himself “Royal Highness” (December 1900), Nicholas became more despotic until he was forced to grant a constitution in 1905. Political dissension nevertheless continued, culminating in the Cetinje bomb plot against him (1907). On August 28, 1910, Nicholas declared himself king. Hoping to gain prestige through the addition of new territories, he joined in the Balkan War of 1912–13 against Turkey, but his territorial acquisitions were disappointing. In World War I he supported Serbia against Austria-Hungary. Defeated, he concluded a separate peace in January 1916 and then went into exile in Italy. When the victorious Serbs entered Montenegro after the defeat of Austria-Hungary, Nicholas and his dynasty were formally deposed by a national assembly (November 26, 1918), and Montenegro was joined to Serbia, later to become part of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (Yugoslavia).
