Anne Of Brittany, French Anne De Bretagne,  (born Jan. 25, 1477, Nantes, Fr.—died  Jan. 9, 1514, Blois), duchess of Brittany and twice queen consort of France, who devoted her life to safeguarding the autonomy of Brittany within the kingdom of France.
Daughter of Duke Francis II of Brittany and Margaret of Foix, Anne succeeded to her father’s duchy on Sept. 9, 1488. The future of the duchy depended on her marriage. In desperation Anne allied herself with Maximilian of Austria, who married her by proxy on Dec. 19, 1490. King Charles VIII of France, fearful that Brittany might pass into the hands of a foreign power, attacked it, and Anne was forced in the end to break with Maximilian and marry Charles (Dec. 6, 1491); the process of the union of Brittany with the French crown was thus begun.
Charles died in 1498 without issue, and Anne, in accordance with an agreement made at the time of their marriage, was married to his successor, Louis XII, on Jan. 8, 1499. The marriage contract declared that Brittany should eventually fall to the second son or to the eldest daughter of the marriage or, failing issue, to Anne’s natural heirs; the special rights and privileges of the duchy were to be maintained.
For the remainder of her life, Anne, a woman of great intelligence, devoted herself to the administration of her duchy and jealously guarded its autonomy, but in the end her daughter Claude was betrothed (1506) to Francis of Angoulême, the future Francis I of France.
A patron of artists and poets, Anne commissioned a Book of Hours that is one of the most beautiful of French manuscripts. She also instituted the queen’s maids of honour at the French court.
