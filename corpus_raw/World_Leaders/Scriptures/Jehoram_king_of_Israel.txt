Jehoram, also called Joram, Hebrew Yehoram, or Yoram,  one of two contemporary Old Testament kings.
Jehoram, the son of Ahab and Jezebel and king (c. 849–c. 842 bc) of Israel, maintained close relations with Judah. Together with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, Jehoram unsuccessfully attempted to subdue a revolt of Moab against Israel. As had his father, Jehoram later endeavoured to recover Ramoth-gilead from Hazael, king of Damascus. In this matter he was aided by his nephew Ahaziah, then king of Judah. Wounded during the fighting at Ramoth-gilead, Jehoram retired to Jezreel in Judah. During his convalescence a revolution took place and Jehu was anointed king at Ramoth-gilead. Jehu then put to death all the members of Ahab’s family including Jehoram, Jezebel, and Ahaziah.
Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat and king (c. 849–c. 842 bc) of Judah, married Athaliah, daughter of Ahab, and was thus brother-in-law of the Jehoram of Israel. On ascending the throne Jehoram massacred his kinsmen. He had to face a successful revolt by Edom, a revolt by Libnak, and an invasion of Philistines and Arabs.
