Joe Manchin, in full Joseph Manchin III,  (born August 24, 1947, Farmington, West Virginia, U.S.), American politician who was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 2010 and began representing West Virginia in that body later that year. He previously served as governor of that state (2005–10).
Manchin grew up in Farmington, West Virginia, where his father owned a furniture store. He attended West Virginia University on a football scholarship until being injured but went on to receive a bachelor’s degree in business (1970). During that time he married (1967) Gayle Conelly, and the couple later had three children. After graduation, Manchin went into business, working at his family’s store and then managing a carpet store before joining a coal brokerage.
Manchin entered electoral politics in 1982, when he successfully ran for the West Virginia House of Delegates. After serving there for four years, he became a member of the state Senate (1986–96). Following an unsuccessful bid for the governorship (1996), Manchin was elected West Virginia’s secretary of state in 2000. He then ran for governor in 2004, and that time he was elected. He served from 2005 to 2010, when he won a special election to complete the term of U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd, who had died. Manchin took office as senator later that year.
Manchin quickly earned a reputation as one of the most-conservative Democrats in the Senate—though he was still to the left of most of his Republican counterparts—and he frequently clashed with Pres. Barack Obama’s administration on policy and legislative matters. He worked closely with numerous Republican colleagues in energy-producing states, such as Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota, to develop an energy-production program that made use of both renewable and nonrenewable sources, including—and especially—coal, an important part of West Virginia’s economy. Manchin was a strong advocate of gun rights, and he opposed same-sex marriage and abortion.
