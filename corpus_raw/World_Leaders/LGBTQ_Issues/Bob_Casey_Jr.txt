Bob Casey, Jr., in full Robert Patrick Casey, Jr.,  (born April 13, 1960, Scranton, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American politician who was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 2006 and began representing Pennsylvania in that body the following year.
Casey was the eldest son of Bob Casey, Sr., a conservative Democrat who served as governor of Pennsylvania (1987–95). After graduating from the College of the Holy Cross in 1982, the younger Casey, who was Roman Catholic, spent the following year teaching fifth grade in Philadelphia as a member of the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. He then studied law at the Catholic University of America (Juris Doctor degree, 1988) and subsequently went into private practice in Scranton, Pennyslvania. During that time he married (1985) Terese Foppiano, and the couple later had four children.
In 1996 Casey entered political life by running for and being elected auditor general of the state, a post he held from 1997 to 2005. He ran for governor in 2002 but lost in the primary. Casey served as state treasurer from 2005 to 2006, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. He easily defeated the incumbent Republican, Rick Santorum.
After taking office in 2007, Casey established a reputation as a moderate to conservative Democrat. Although he strongly supported gun-ownership rights, he endorsed background checks and efforts to control the sale of assault weapons to individuals. An advocate for children, he introduced legislation to increase funding for access to early childhood education, and he helped reauthorize a program that funded education for pediatricians. Casey opposed abortion but was a vocal supporter of marriage equality. He also helped repeal “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the policy that barred openly gay men and women from serving in the U.S. military.
