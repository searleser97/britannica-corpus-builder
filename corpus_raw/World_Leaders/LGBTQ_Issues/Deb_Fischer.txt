Deb Fischer, in full Debra Strobel Fischer,  (born March 1, 1951, Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.), American politician who was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 2012 and began representing Nebraska in that body the following year.
Strobel grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska. She attended the University of Nebraska, where she met Bruce Fischer. They married in 1972, and Deb left school before graduating. They ran a cattle ranch near Valentine, and the couple later had three children. She eventually resumed her studies at the University of Nebraska, earning a bachelor’s degree (1988) in education.
Fischer first became involved in electoral politics in 1990, when she successfully ran for the board of the Valentine Rural High School. She held the seat until 2004, when she was elected to Nebraska’s unicameral legislature. She served two terms, with appointments to committees on revenue and natural resources. During that time she gained a reputation for her highly effective political style. In 2012 Fischer ran for the U.S. Senate. Despite being greatly outspent, she surprised many observers by defeating two prominent Republicans in the primary and then former senator Bob Kerrey in the general election. Fischer took office in 2013, becoming Nebraska’s first female senator since 1954.
Fischer’s positions were often characterized as highly conservative. On social issues, she opposed same-sex marriage, gun control, and abortion, even in the cases of rape or incest. Fiscally, she supported a balanced-budget amendment and was against tax increases. By the start of the 114th Congress in 2015, Fischer had a perfect attendance record in the Senate, not missing a single roll call vote.
