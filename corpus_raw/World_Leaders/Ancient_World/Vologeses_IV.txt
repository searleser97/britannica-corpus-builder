Vologeses IV (or III),   (died ad 192), king of Parthia (reigned 148–192).
In the early part of his reign he was able to restore the internal unity of the Parthian empire; in 161, however, he invaded Cappadocia and Syria and as a consequence was attacked by a powerful Roman expedition (162–165). Doura-Europus and Seleucia were destroyed, and the Parthian royal palace at Ctesiphon, in Babylonia, was burned; the Romans even advanced into Media. Continued sporadic fighting in Babylonia and Armenia led to further reductions of Parthian influence, and in the peace treaty northern Mesopotamia was ceded to the Romans. Vologeses was succeeded by his son Vologeses V (or IV).
