Philip, also called Philip the Tetrarch or Herod Philip,  (born 20 bce—died 34 ce), son of Herod I the Great and Cleopatra of Jerusalem (not to be confused with another Herod Philip, son of Herod I the Great by Mariamne II). He ruled ably as tetrarch over the former northeastern quarter of his father’s kingdom of Judaea.
When the Roman emperor Augustus adjusted Herod’s will, Philip was assigned to the region east of the Sea of Galilee, in modern northern Israel, Lebanon, and southern Syria. In 6 ce he may have joined in charging his half brother with misgoverning Judaea, but with little benefit to himself, for Judaea then became a Roman province.
Of his father’s inheritance, his was the poorest share, but he ruled it well. Because he had few Jewish subjects, he pursued a policy of Hellenization. His coins bore the emperor’s image, and he rebuilt a town, Bethsaida (on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee), and renamed it Julias in honour of the emperor’s daughter. Near the source of the Jordan River, he founded another town and allowed it a large degree of self-government, on the Greek pattern.
Philip was less extravagant a ruler than any of his brothers. He avoided prolonged trips to Rome, instead traveling extensively in his territory and devoting his time to his subjects. Late in his reign he married Salome, the daughter of Herodias, who was her mother’s tool in securing from Herod Antipas the execution of John the Baptist.
