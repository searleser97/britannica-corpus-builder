Bahrām VI Chūbīn,  (flourished  6th century ad), Sāsānian king (reigned 590–591). A general and head of the house of Mihran at Rayy (near modern Tehrān), he performed, in gaining the throne, a feat exceptional for one not of Sāsānian royal blood.
Prominent as master of the household in the Byzantine wars of the Sāsānian king Hormizd IV, Bahrām later received the supreme command in Khorāsān and was able to repel a Turkish invasion. Following a defeat by the Romans in 589, however, he was harshly treated by Hormizd. Bahrām, with the support of his army, rebelled; in the ensuing disorder, Hormizd was assassinated, and Khosrow II, his successor, marched against the irreconcilable general. The royal troops, however, mutinied, and Khosrow fled to the Byzantines. Bahrām then proclaimed himself king. In 591, with Byzantine support, Khosrow regained the throne. Bahrām escaped to Turkistan, where he was assassinated. His colourful career became the subject of a Middle Persian popular romance.
