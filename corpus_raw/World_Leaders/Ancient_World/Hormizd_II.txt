Hormizd II,   (died 309), king of the Sāsānian empire (reigned ad 302–309); he was the son and successor of Narses.
Little is known of Hormizd’s reign, although according to one ancient source he executed some members of the Manichaean religion. At Hormizd’s death powerful nobles killed his son Adhur-Narses, who had assumed the throne, and imprisoned another son, Hormizdas. In 324 Hormizdas escaped to the court of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great.
