Ashur-uballit I,   (reigned c. 1365–30 bc), king of Assyria during Mesopotamia’s feudal age, who created the first Assyrian empire and initiated the Middle Assyrian period (14th to 12th century bc). With the help of the Hittites he destroyed the dominion of the Aryan Mitanni (a non-Semitic people from upper Iran and Syria who had subjugated Assyria), ravaged Nineveh (near present Mosul, Iraq), and sent off the image of Assyria’s deity Ishtar to the Egyptian pharaoh (early 14th century). Later, allied with the Kassite successors in Babylonia, Ashur-uballit ended Hittite and Hurrian rule. By intermarriage he then influenced the Kassite dynasty and eventually dominated all of Babylonia, thus paving the way for the Neo-Assyrian mastery during the Sargonid dynasty (12th to 7th century).
