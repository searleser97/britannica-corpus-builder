Seqenenre, also called Seqenenre Tao,  (flourished 16th century bce), king of ancient Egypt whose reign (c. 1545 bce) was contemporaneous with the last portion of the Hyksos dynasty, the west-Semitic conquerors who ruled much of Egypt in the 17th century bce (see ancient Egypt: The Second Intermediate period).
As shown by a literary tale of later date, Seqenenre was contemporary with Apopis, one of the last great Hyksos kings. According to the tale, the Hyksos ruler provoked a quarrel by claiming that hippopotamuses at Thebes were disturbing his sleep at his delta capital, 400 miles (644 km) away. Unfortunately, the preserved text ends with Seqenenre and his court pondering a suitable response.
Seqenenre died violently: his mummy displays five terrible head woundsâ€”a crushing blow, three ax wounds, and a spear or sword thrust. Because the ax wounds were inflicted while he lay on the ground, some scholars suggest that he was assassinated as he slept. It is equally possible that his death occurred in battle. In either case the evident hasty embalming, accompanied by failure to arrange the limbs correctly, suggests that the king died under extreme circumstances.
