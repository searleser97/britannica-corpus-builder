Pepi II,  fifth king of the 6th dynasty (c. 2325–c. 2150 bce) of ancient Egypt, during whose lengthy reign the government became weakened because of internal and external troubles. Late Egyptian tradition indicates that Pepi II acceded at the age of six and, in accord with king lists of the New Kingdom (1539–1075 bce), credits him with a 94-year reign. Contemporary texts record his 62nd and 65th years.
Pepi II was a son of Pepi I and was born late in his father’s reign. While still very young, he succeeded his half-brother Merenre, who died at an early age. His mother served as regent for a number of years, and the old group of officials serving the royal family maintained the kingdom’s stability. Expeditions of trade and conquest to lower Nubia and Punt (the Somali coast of Africa), however, met with a certain amount of resistance, and the political situation in Lower Nubia is described in the remarkable biography of the royal commissioner, Harkhuf. Pepi’s ties with the city of Coptos (present-day Qifṭ) in Upper Egypt are illustrated by the series of protective decrees he issued in favour of the priesthood there.
Internally, the vizierate passed from the family that had served Pepi’s predecessors and descended through a number of other officials. Powerful provincial nobles drew talent away from the capital, and, because of the unusually long reign of the king, Egypt had a senile ruler when it needed vigorous leadership. Those of Pepi’s children who survived him had brief, ephemeral reigns and failed to cope with the political and economic crises that arose as the 6th dynasty ended.
Pepi’s pyramid complex at Ṣaqqārah, across the Nile from Cairo, was among the largest of the 5th (c. 2465–c. 2325 bce) and 6th dynasties. Structural weakness, aggravated by an earthquake, later required that a girdle wall be built around the pyramid.
