Jovian, Latin in full Flavius Jovianus,  (born c. 331, Singidunum, Moesia Superior [now Belgrade, Serb.]—died  Feb. 17, 364, Dadastana, Bithynia [in present-day Turkey]), Roman emperor from 363 to 364.
Jovian took part in the expedition of the emperor Julian against Sāsānian Persia. He held the rank of senior staff officer and was proclaimed emperor by his troops after Julian was killed on June 26, 363. To extricate his army from Persia, the new ruler immediately concluded a peace, ceding to the Persians all Roman territory east of the Tigris River, together with the cities of Singara (modern Sinjār, Iraq) and Nisibis (modern Nusaybin, Turkey). Some of Jovian’s contemporaries, believing that the army could have fought its way out, considered this treaty to be dishonourable.
As a Christian, Jovian disapproved of paganism, which had been encouraged under his predecessor. Magical practices were forbidden and gifts to churches restored. While still on his way from the frontier to Constantinople he died at Dadastana on the borders of Bithynia and Galatia and was buried in the church of the Holy Apostles in the capital. He was succeeded as emperor by Valentinian I.
