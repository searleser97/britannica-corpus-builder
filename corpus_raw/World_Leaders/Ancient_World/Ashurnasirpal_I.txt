Ashurnasirpal I,  (flourished 11th century bc), king of Assyria 1050â€“32 bc, when it was at a low ebb in power and prosperity caused by widespread famine and the pressure of western desert nomads, against whom Ashurnasirpal warred constantly. His father, Shamshi-Adad IV, a son of Tiglath-pileser I, was placed on the throne of Assyria by the Babylonian king Adad-apal-iddina. The few inscriptions of Ashurnasirpal I that survive reflect the unhappy situation in Assyria during his reign.
