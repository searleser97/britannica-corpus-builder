Bindusara, also called Bindusara Maurya, Greek Amitrochates,  (born c. 320 bce—died 272/3 bce), second Mauryan emperor, who ascended the throne about 297 bce. Greek sources refer to him as Amitrochates, Greek for the Sanskrit amitraghata (“destroyer of foes”). The name perhaps reflects his successful campaign in the Deccan. Chandragupta—Bindusara’s father and founder of the Mauryan empire—had already conquered northern India. Bindusara’s campaign stopped close to what is today Karnataka, probably because the territories of the extreme south, such as those of the Cholas, Pandyas, and Cheras, had good relations with the Mauryas. After Bindusara’s death, his sons engaged in a war of succession, from which Ashoka emerged victorious after several years of conflict.
