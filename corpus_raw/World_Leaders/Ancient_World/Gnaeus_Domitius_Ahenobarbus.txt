Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus,  (died 31 bc), Roman general who became one of the chief partisans of Mark Antony after Antony defeated the assassins of Julius Caesar.
With his father, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, he had been a member of the group that in 49 bc made an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Caesar from seizing power. After the assassination of Caesar in 44, the planning for which had been led by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus, Ahenobarbus was accused of participation in the plot and was convicted in absentia.
He commanded the assassins’ fleet. When they were defeated by the forces of Antony and Octavian (later the emperor Augustus) at Philippi in Macedonia in 42, Ahenobarbus held out as a privateer until he was reconciled with Antony in 40. From 40 until about 35 he served Antony as governor of Bithynia. He was consul at Rome in 32, when the final breach occurred between Antony and Octavian. Ahenobarbus then left Italy to join Antony in the east, but he opposed the Egyptian queen Cleopatra’s dominance over Antony and deserted to Octavian shortly before Octavian defeated Antony and Cleopatra at Actium in 31. Ahenobarbus died soon afterward, reputedly of remorse but in fact from a disease contracted before the battle.
