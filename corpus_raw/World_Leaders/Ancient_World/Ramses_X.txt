Ramses X, Ramses also spelled Ramesses or Rameses,  (flourished 12th century bce), king of Egypt (reigned 1108â€“04 bce), during whose poorly documented reign disorders that had become endemic under his predecessor continued.
Only one year of his reign is definitely attested, by a diary from his third year, found in western Thebes. It reveals that tomb cutters were idle for long periods, both because Libyans were roaming the area and because rations due the workmen were in arrears. According to one entry, workmen flatly refused to obey even an order given by the vizier himself. The high priest of Amon, often referred to in the diary, was probably Amenhotep, who survived into the next reign.
