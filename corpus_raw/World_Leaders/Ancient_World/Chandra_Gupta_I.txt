Chandra Gupta I,  king of India (reigned 320 to c. 330 ce) and founder of the  Gupta empire. He was the grandson of Sri Gupta, the first known ruler of the Gupta line. Chandra Gupta I, whose early life is unknown, became a local chief in the kingdom of Magadha (parts of modern Bihar state). He increased his power and territory by marrying, about 308, Princess Kumaradevi of the Licchavi tribe, which then controlled north Bihar and perhaps Nepal. Toward the close of the 3rd century ce, India consisted of a number of independent states, both monarchical and nonmonarchical; it is highly probable that the Guptas and Licchavis ruled over adjoining principalities. Their union by marriage enhanced the power and prestige of the new kingdom. Special gold coins depicted the king and queen on one side and the Licchavis on the other. The chronology of the Gupta era, dating from 320 and used in India for several centuries, is believed to be based on the date of either his coronation or his marriage.
By the conclusion of his reign, his kingdom probably extended west to the present-day city of Allahabad and included Ayodhya and southern Bihar. These regions were assigned to him by the Puranas (ancient chronicles of early Sanskrit literature). His dominions must have been sufficiently large to justify his assumption of the imperial title, maharajadhiraja (“king of kings”), and to enable his son Samudra Gupta to begin the conquest that led to the founding of the Gupta empire.
The suggestion that Chandra Gupta I conquered the Scythians is probably without foundation. Nor is it likely that he overcame the Licchavis by killing their king or that he was murdered by his heir. The tradition generally accepted is that the king held an assembly of councillors and royal family members at which Prince Samudra Gupta was formally nominated to succeed his abdicating father.
