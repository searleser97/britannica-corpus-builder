Smendes, also called Nesbenebded,  (flourished  11th century bce), king of ancient Egypt (1070–44 bce), founder of the 21st dynasty (1075–c. 950 bce), who established the capital at Tanis, in the northeast Nile River delta, while high priests of Amon ruled Thebes and Upper Egypt.
Smendes, a native of the delta, probably secured his right to rule through his queen, Tentamon, who was possibly related to the previous dynasty. Though the high priests of Amon held a large measure of power in Upper Egypt, they recognized Smendes as pharaoh and cooperated with him. Smendes was evidently buried at Tanis, as shown by a piece of his funerary equipment found there.
