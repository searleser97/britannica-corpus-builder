Salitis, also spelled Salatis, also called Shalik, or Mayebre Sheshi,  the first Hyksos king of Egypt and founder of the 15th dynasty.
The Hyksos were Middle Bronze Age Palestinian invaders who infiltrated Egypt gradually and seized the kingship. Tradition says that Salitis overran all of Egypt, but his actual rule probably did not extend south of Middle Egypt, while the rest of Egypt consisted of his vassals. His seals probably reached Nubia, farther south, through trade. Salitis also, according to tradition, was the Hyksos king who fortified Avaris in the northeastern Nile River delta, making it the chief Hyksos garrison in Egypt.
