Psamtik III, Psamtik also spelled Psammetichus,  (flourished 6th century bce), last king (reigned 526–525 bce) of the 26th dynasty (664–525 bce; see ancient Egypt: The Late period [664–332 bce]) of ancient Egypt, who failed to block the Persian invasion of 525 and was later executed for treason.
The 5th-century-bce Greek historian Herodotus, the primary source for knowledge of the reign, states that in 525 bce, after only six months on the throne, Psamtik confronted a Persian invasion led by King Cambyses II. After the enemy had crossed Sinai with the aid of the Arabs, a bitter battle was fought at Pelusium, a city on Egypt’s eastern frontier. The Egyptians with their mercenaries were compelled to withdraw to Memphis, the traditional capital, near Cairo. Cambyses besieged the city and captured it, seizing Psamtik. The former king was initially well treated, but he was later executed for conspiracy against the Persians.
