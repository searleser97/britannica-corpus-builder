Aulus Hirtius,  (born c. 90 bc—died  April 21, 43, near Mutina, Gallia Cispadana [now Modena, Italy]), Roman soldier and writer.
Beginning about 54 bc Hirtius served under Julius Caesar in Gaul and was sent to negotiate with Caesar’s rival, Pompey, in December 50. Hirtius then served in Spain and the East and was praetor (46) and governor (45) of Transalpine Gaul. He was nominated (44) by Caesar, along with Gaius Vibius Pansa, for the consulship of 43; and, after the dictator’s assassination in March 44, he and Pansa supported the senatorial movement against Mark Antony, with whom Hirtius had at first sided. In 43 the two consuls set out for Mutina, where Mark Antony was besieging Decimus Brutus, and inflicted a severe defeat on Antony at Forum Gallorum. A few days later they again defeated him in battle near Mutina, but Hirtius was killed in action and Pansa died of wounds. Both men were granted a public burial in the Campus Martius, in Rome, where traces of Hirtius’ tomb have been found.
Hirtius is almost certainly the author of the continuation of Caesar’s Commentaries, the eighth book of the Gallic War, and probably also of the history of the Alexandrine War. He was a personal friend of Cicero, but his correspondence with the orator, which was published in nine books, has not survived.
