Redjedef, also called Djedefre,  third king of the 4th dynasty (c. 2575–c. 2465 bce) of ancient Egypt. Redjedef was a son of Khufu, builder of the Great Pyramid, by a secondary queen. The original crown prince, Kawab, who had married the heiress Hetepheres II, apparently predeceased his father. At Khufu’s death, Redjedef married Hetepheres II and became king; but since he came from a secondary branch of the royal family, he may have usurped the kingship.
At Abū Ruwaysh, north of Al-Jīzah (Giza), Redjedef started a pyramid about the size of the pyramid of Menkaure (see Pyramids of Giza), but it was never completed. Granite blocks of its casing have been found, together with the remains of a funerary temple with granite columns. The king also worked the diorite quarries in Nubia (the modern Sudan) near Abu Simbel, where his name occurs. He seems to have ruled for just eight years and was succeeded on the throne by his brother.
Statue fragments of Redjedef and his family have been discovered at his pyramid complex, so it is likely that his mortuary cult was celebrated for a period of time.
