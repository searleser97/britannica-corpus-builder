Ixtlilxóchitl,  (flourished 1500–1550), Aztec chieftain, the chief of Texcoco who supported the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés in the conquest of rival Aztecs in Tenochtitlán.
At the time of the Spanish conquest, the cities of Texcoco and Tenochtitlán (the capital of the Aztec confederation) were engaged in an active rivalry with each other. Ixtlilxóchitl, moreover, was involved in an internal dispute with his brother over leadership of the Texcocans. When Cortés offered to support his claims and the aspirations of Texcoco, Ixtlilxóchitl allied his people with the Spanish invaders and assisted in the siege of Tenochtitlán. Although he remained an ally of Spain, he eventually lost the favour of his disillusioned subjects.
