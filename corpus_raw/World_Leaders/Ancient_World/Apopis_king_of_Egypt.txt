Apopis, also spelled Apophis or Apopi,  Hyksos king of ancient Egypt (reigned c. 1585–42 bce), who initially controlled much of Egypt but was driven back northward to the vicinity of his capital in the Nile River delta by the successive attacks of the Theban pharaohs.
Apopis is attested in Upper Egypt by stone fragments from Al-Gabalayn. A literary tale concerning Apopis and the Theban king Seqenenre portrays the Thebans as vassals of the Hyksos ruler, but this probably does not reflect historical reality. Egyptians and Hyksos peacefully coexisted for some time, as the Thebans seem to have grazed their cattle in the Nile delta, which was ruled by the Hyksos.
War may have erupted between Apopis and Seqenenre, as the Theban king’s mummy displays terrible head wounds. His successor, Kamose, declared a Middle Egyptian town as his northern frontier. He carried on the war, as is shown by two monuments from Thebes, and drove the Hyksos northward to the vicinity of Memphis (near Cairo). A Theban fleet also sailed by Avaris, Apopis’s delta capital.
Apopis reacted by calling on his ally to the south, the Kushite prince, to attack the Thebans in their rear. His messenger, however, was intercepted, and his plan was thwarted by Kamose. Some time soon after this raid, but before the final Hyksos expulsion, Apopis died.
