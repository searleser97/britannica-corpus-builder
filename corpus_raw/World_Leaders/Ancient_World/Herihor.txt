Herihor,  (flourished 11th century bce), ancient Egyptian army officer and high priest of Amon at Karnak (Thebes), who founded a dynasty of priest-kings that ruled southern Egypt when the country became disunited in the last years of the 20th dynasty (1190–1075 bce).
Herihor’s origins are altogether obscure. He is believed to have advanced through the military ranks during the troubled reign of Ramses XI, the last king of the 20th dynasty. It was probably Herihor who expelled the viceroy of Kush from Thebes around the 19th year of Ramses’ reign. At the same time, he began a new dating scheme, probably to mark his own rise to power.
Herihor’s claims to royal status are clearly recorded only in the temple of Khons in Thebes. Reliefs in the pillared hall depict his titles of high priest of Amon, general, and captain, but subsequently, in the forecourt of the temple, he took the full pharaonic title and completely ignored Ramses XI. Nonetheless, Ramses outlived Herihor by at least two years.
