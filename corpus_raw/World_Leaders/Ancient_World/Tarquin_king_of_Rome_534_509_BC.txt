Tarquin, Latin in full Lucius Tarquinius Superbus,  (flourished  6th century bc—died 495 bc, Cumae [near modern Naples, Italy]), traditionally the seventh and last king of Rome, accepted by some scholars as a historical figure. His reign is dated from 534 to 509 bc.
Tarquinius Superbus was, in Roman tradition, the son (according to Fabius Pictor) or grandson (according to Calpurnius Piso Frugi) of Tarquinius Priscus and son-in-law of Servius Tullius. Tarquin supposedly murdered Tullius and established an absolute despotism—hence his name Superbus, meaning “the proud.” In the reign of terror that followed, many senators were put to death. Eventually a group of senators led by Lucius Junius Brutus raised a revolt, the immediate cause of which was the rape of a noblewoman, Lucretia, by Tarquin’s son Sextus. The Tarquin family was expelled from Rome, and the monarchy at Rome was abolished (traditionally 509 bc). Tarquin was said to have provoked a series of attacks on Rome by its neighbours. The Etruscan cities of Caere, Veii, and Tarquinii were defeated by Rome at the Battle of Silva Arsia. Tarquin’s appeal to Lars Porsenna of Clusium led to a Roman defeat, but not to Tarquin’s restoration. Finally he roused his son-in-law, Octavius Mamilius, dictator of the Latin League, to fight Rome at Lake Regillus. After the defeat of the Latins there, Tarquin fled to the Greek tyrant Aristodemus of Cumae.
The text of a treaty between a Tarquin—probably Tarquinius Superbus—and the city of Gabii, 12 miles (19 km) from Rome, did actually exist and was preserved in the Temple of Semo Sancus in Rome until the age of Augustus (27 bc–ad 14).
