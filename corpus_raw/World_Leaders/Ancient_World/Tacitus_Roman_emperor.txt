Tacitus, in full Marcus Claudius Tacitus,  (born c. 200—died c. June 276, Tyana, Cappadocia [near modern Niğde, Tur.]), Roman emperor in 275–276.
In the 40 years before Tacitus assumed power the empire was ruled by a succession of usurpers and emperors who had been career army officers. On the murder of the emperor Aurelian in 275, the army council invited the Senate to select a nobleman as head of state. The Senate delayed six months before choosing (September 275) Tacitus, an elderly and wealthy senator who had served twice as consul. During his brief reign Tacitus was engaged in continual warfare with hostile tribes in the Eastern Empire. It is uncertain whether he was murdered by his soldiers or died of disease. His successor was his half brother, Florian, who ruled for three months before being killed by his soldiers.
