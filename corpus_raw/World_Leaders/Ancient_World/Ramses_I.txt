Ramses I, Ramses also spelled Ramesses or Rameses,  (flourished 14th century bce), king of ancient Egypt (reigned 1292–90 bce), founder of the 19th dynasty (1292–1190 bce) of Egypt.
Probably descended from a nonroyal military family from the northeast Egyptian delta, Ramses found favour with Horemheb, the last king of the 18th dynasty (1539–1292 bce), who was also a military man. As the elderly king had no son of his own, he made Ramses coregent not long before his own death. By then Ramses also was of advanced age, but his son, Seti I, was in the prime of life.
In 1292 Ramses I ascended the throne and shortly thereafter made Seti his coregent to help him assume some of the more rigorous royal duties. While his son planned campaigns against Syria in an attempt to regain Egypt’s lost possessions there, Ramses completed the decoration of the second pylon and its vestibule in the great Karnak temple of the national god, Amon, at Thebes, which was built and partly decorated by his predecessor. He was also involved in the building of the great colonnaded hall in the temple at Karnak and had begun its decoration just before his death in 1290.
Inscriptions reveal that Ramses reigned about one year and four months. He was buried in a small hastily prepared tomb in the Valley of the Kings at Thebes. Later, during a time of political upheaval, the mummy was disinterred and moved to a secret resting place. In the late 19th century that tomb was rediscovered, but the king’s remains had already been removed by looters. The mummy became part of the collection of a small museum in Niagara Falls, Canada, in the mid-19th century. When the museum closed in 1999, the collection was obtained by the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University in Georgia, which then verified the mummy’s identity as Ramses I. In 2003 the mummy was returned to Egypt.
