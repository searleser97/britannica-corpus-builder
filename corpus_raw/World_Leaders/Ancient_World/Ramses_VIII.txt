Ramses VIII, Ramses also spelled Ramesses or Rameses,  (flourished 12th century bce), king of Egypt (reigned 1128–26 bce) whose ephemeral reign occurred immediately after that of Ramses VII and is poorly documented.
Some modern historians place this king before Ramses VII, following the list of princes—descendants of Ramses III, depicted in the temple of that pharaoh at Madīnat Habu in western Thebes—on which his name appears directly after that of Ramses VI, implying that he was Ramses VI’s direct successor. However, close study of the economic documents of this period, and the fact that Ramses VII is known to be the son of Ramses VI, substantiate the older view that Ramses VIII’s brief reign followed that of Ramses VII.
Other than the reference in the temple of his great-grandfather, Ramses VIII is known only by mention in a stela and a single scarab. His tomb, if indeed he ever owned one, has not yet been found in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes.
