Anthemius, in full Procopius Anthemius,  (died 472), Western Roman emperor who reigned from April 12, 467, to July 11, 472.
The son-in-law of the Eastern emperor Marcian, Anthemius was appointed to his office by Marcian’s successor, Leo I, who wanted help in attacking the Vandals in North Africa. The powerful patrician Ricimer, kingmaker of the Western Empire, accepted Anthemius with the stipulation that his daughter, Alypia, marry Ricimer. Anthemius’s popularity in Italy suffered, however, because as a Greek and a philosopher he was suspected of wanting to restore paganism. The vast expedition against the Vandals ended in utter defeat for the Romans in 468. Ricimer and Anthemius quarreled, and, in 472, the patrician besieged the emperor in Rome. Anthemius’s forces were defeated; he was found disguised as a beggar and beheaded.
