Ay, also spelled Aye,  (flourished 14th century bce), king of ancient Egypt (reigned 1323–19 bce) of the 18th dynasty, who rose from the ranks of the civil service and the military to become king after the death of Tutankhamen.
Ay first appears as a member of the court of Akhenaton, at his capital city of Akhetaton, where Ay’s large private tomb is found. His military functions included master of the horse and troop leader, but his primary title, “God’s Father,” indicates an especially close relationship to the royal family. Ay’s wife, Tey, also served as the nurse of Nefertiti, Akhenaton’s queen, and it has been surmised that Ay and Tey were her parents.
With Akhenaton’s death and the accession of the young Tutankhamen to the throne, Ay may well have taken on the role of elder statesman and may have been one of the guiding hands behind the court’s abandonment of Akhetaton (Tell el-Amarna) and the reinstatement of the primacy of Amon at Thebes. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that he acquired the title of vizier under Tutankhamen, but, when the king died childless at a young age, Ay presided at the funeral in the role of Tutankhamen’s presumptive heir.
Although it has been claimed that Ay married Tutankhamen’s widow, Ankhesenamen, on the basis of their names appearing jointly on several small objects, there is no evidence for such a union, and Ay remained married to his wife of many years. Ay seems to have usurped both the tomb and mortuary temple of Tutankhamen at Thebes, with the latter buried in a hastily converted private tomb in the Valley of the Kings and Ay receiving a much larger sepulchre in the nearby west valley. In other respects he continued to honour the memory of his young predecessor, adding his own texts next to those of Tutankhamen and continuing the decoration of the Temple of Luxor.
Ay died after a short reign and was succeeded in office by the general Horemheb.
