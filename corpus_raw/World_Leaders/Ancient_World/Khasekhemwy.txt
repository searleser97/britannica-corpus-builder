Khasekhemwy,  also spelled Khasekhemui,  (flourished  27th century bce), sixth and last ruler of Egypt in the 2nd dynasty (c. 2775–c. 2650 bce), who apparently ended the internal struggles of the mid-2nd dynasty.
Khasekhemwy, whose name means “the two powers have appeared,” is the only king of Egypt to have selected a royal name that commemorates both Horus, the god traditionally associated with the living king, and Seth, his trickster brother; the emblematic animals of both deities are depicted above his serekh (the stylized rectangular frame in which a king’s Horus name was displayed). Some scholars have interpreted this double symbol as an indication of a civil reconciliation after internal disruptions initiated by Khasekhemwy’s predecessor, Peribsen, who used only Seth instead of the canonical Horus, but there is little evidence to support such a view. Khasekhemwy built at Hierakonpolis, Al-Kāb (El-Kab), and Abydos, the latter site containing his royal tomb, which was the first to use extensive stone masonry. Two seated statues in his likeness, discovered at Hierakonpolis, are adorned with figures of defeated enemies, and another relief shows him triumphant over Nubia. His queen, Nimaathetep, was probably the mother or grandmother of the first kings of the 3rd dynasty, Nebka and Djoser.
