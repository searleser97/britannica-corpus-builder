Liu Bei, Wade-Giles romanization Liu Pei, posthumous name (shi) Zhaoliedi, temple name (miaohao) Xianzu,  (born ad 162,  Zhu Xian [now in Hebei province], China—died 223, Sichuan province), founder of the Shu-Han dynasty (ad 221–263/264), one of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguo) into which China was divided at the end of the Han dynasty (206 bc–ad 220).
Although Liu claimed descent from one of the early Han emperors, he grew up in poverty. Distinguishing himself in battle in the great Yellow Turban Rebellion that broke out at the end of the Han, he eventually became one of the leading Han generals and a rival of the other great general, Cao Cao. Liu Bei occupied the area in central China around Sichuan. After Cao Pi, the son of Cao Cao, usurped the Han throne in 220, Liu Bei founded his own dynasty. Liu retained the name Han for his new dynasty, and his is usually known as the Shu- (“Minor”) Han to distinguish it from the Han proper. As one of the heroes of the 14th-century Chinese historical novel Sanguozhi Yanyi (Romance of the Three Kingdoms), Liu has been celebrated and romanticized in Chinese history. The dynasty that he founded, however, never expanded much beyond Sichuan and lasted only until 263/264.
