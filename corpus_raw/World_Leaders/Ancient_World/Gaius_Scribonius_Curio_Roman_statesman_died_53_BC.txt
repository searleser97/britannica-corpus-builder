Gaius Scribonius Curio,  (died 53 bc), Roman statesman and orator, father of a noted politician of the same name.
Curio opposed Saturninus in 100 bc, was tribune in 90 bc, and served in Sulla’s army in Greece against Archelaus, general of Mithradates, and as his legate in Asia, where he was commissioned to restore the kings of Bithynia and Cappadocia to their thrones. In 76 he was consul, and as governor of Macedonia (75–73) defeated the Dardanians, thereby becoming the first Roman general to penetrate as far as the Danube. On his return he was granted a triumph. In 63, during the discussion as to the punishment of the Catilinarian conspirators, Curio supported Cicero, but he spoke in favour of P. Clodius at the latter’s trial (61). This led to a violent attack on the part of Cicero, but it does not appear to have permanently impaired their friendship.
