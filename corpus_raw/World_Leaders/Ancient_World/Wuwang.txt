Wuwang, Wade-Giles romanization Wu-wang, personal name (xingming) Ji Fa,  (flourished 11th century bc, China),  reign name (nianhao) of the founder and first ruler (1046–43 bc) of the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 bc). He was regarded by later Confucians as a wise king.
Ji Fa succeeded his father, the famous Wenwang, as head of the semibarbaric state of Zhou, located on the western border of China. Wenwang had assumed the title Xi Bo (“King of the West”) and had begun to plot against the Chinese Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 bc). The Wuwang emperor continued his father’s work and formed a coalition with eight other border states, which defeated the evil last ruler of the Shang. The final battles were said to have been extremely bloody, and Shang survivors may well have served as Chinese culture bearers to places as far removed as Korea.
After establishing the Zhou dynasty, Wuwang, assisted by his brother, known as the duke of Zhou, consolidated his rule by establishing a feudalistic form of government, which parceled out territory to relatives and vassals willing to acknowledge Zhou suzerainty. Even descendants of the defeated Shang were allowed to rule over a portion of their former domain.
