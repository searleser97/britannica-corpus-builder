Marcus Aemilius Scaurus,  (died after 52 bc), quaestor and proquaestor to Gnaeus Pompey in the third war (74–63) between Rome and King Mithradates of Pontus (in northeastern Anatolia).
Scaurus was the son of a powerful politician of the same name. In 64, Scaurus marched to Judaea, where he—perhaps after being bribed—installed as sovereign Aristobulus II over the rival claimant, John Hyrcanus II. Pompey later reversed the judgment. Scaurus also invaded Nabataea and, as aedile in 58, issued coins, some of which have survived, commemorating his botched campaign as a glorious victory. He spent much of his fortune on public games and so won enough popular support to be elected praetor in 56. As praetor he presided over the trial of Publius Sestius for street violence against Publius Clodius. (Cicero gave a famous speech for the successful defense.)
Scaurus recovered his fortune during his term as governor of Sardinia (55), but he was prosecuted for extortion the next year. Cicero, Quintus Hortensius, and other distinguished conservatives defended him and obtained an acquittal. Subsequently, in the campaign for the consulship, he and all the other candidates were charged with bribery. Cicero again defended him, but Pompey, who hated Scaurus for marrying his ex-wife Mucia, convicted him. Scaurus went into exile and never returned to power.
