Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus,  (born 85 bc—died 43 bc), Roman general who participated in the assassination of the dictator Julius Caesar, though he had been Caesar’s protégé.
After serving under Caesar in Gaul, Brutus was given command of Caesar’s fleet. In 49, during the Civil War between Caesar and Pompey, he led a fleet at the siege of Massilia (now Marseille, France). Caesar then made him governor of Transalpine Gaul (48–46), designated him for a consulship in 42, and nominated him as one of his heirs in the event of the death of his primary successor, Octavian (later the emperor Augustus).
After taking part in the assassination of Caesar in March 44, Brutus left Rome to occupy Cisalpine Gaul (now northern Italy), which had been assigned to him by Caesar, for the republicans. Mark Antony besieged him at Mutina (now Modina, Italy), but the consuls of 43, supported by Octavian, relieved the siege in April of that year. The Senate then gave Brutus the command against Antony, whom Brutus pursued into Gallia Narbonensis (now in southern France). At this point his soldiers deserted him for Octavian (the future emperor Augustus), who refused to cooperate with him. Trying to make his way to Marcus Brutus in the East, he was captured by a Gallic chieftain and was put to death at Antony’s order.
