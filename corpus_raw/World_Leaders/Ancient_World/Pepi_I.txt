Pepi I,  third king of the 6th dynasty (c. 2325–c. 2150 bce) of ancient Egypt, whose reign saw the spread of trade and conquest and a growth in the influence of powerful provincials from Upper Egypt.
Pepi was the son of Teti, founder of the 6th dynasty. Before succeeding his father, Pepi lived through the brief reign of Userkare, whose relationship to Teti is unknown and who has been considered, on the slimmest of evidence, to have been a usurper. Two of Pepi’s chief queens were sisters of his vizier, one of the Upper Egyptian potentates; they each bore a son who succeeded to the throne.
Pepi I initiated a policy of intensive penetration of Nubia, south of the First Nile Cataract. Inscriptions record journeys southward early in his reign. Fragments of vessels bearing the king’s name were excavated at Karmah, though some scholars believe that the vessels were taken there later. Uni, another Upper Egyptian and a close confidant of the king, recruited troops from Nubia as well as from Egypt in preparation for raids against rebellious Bedouins of the northeastern frontier.
Extensive trade with Lebanon is attested by numerous vessels made during Pepi’s reign and found at Byblos. An Upper Egyptian biography mentions frequent journeys to Punt, on the Somali coast of eastern Africa. Pepi’s courtiers also led quarrying expeditions to various parts of Egypt, and remains of a temple of the king have been found deep in the Nile River delta. Pepi’s pyramid complex was built at Ṣaqqārah, southwest of Cairo; its name, Men-nefer, eventually became attached to Memphis, the nearby capital of Egypt.
