Ardashīr II,  (flourished  4th century), king of the Sāsānian empire in ancient Persia (reigned ad 379–383). During the reign of his brother Shāpūr II, he had been king of Adiabene (now a region of northeast Iraq), where he took part in the persecution of Christians. After Shāpūr’s death, he was set on the throne by the nobles, presumably at an advanced age. His investiture is commemorated in a rock carving at Ṭāq-e Bostān. His attempts to assert himself were futile, and he was soon deposed.
