Olybrius, in full Anicius Olybrius,  (died Nov. 2, 472), Western Roman emperor from April to November 472.
Before he became head of state, Olybrius was a wealthy senator; he married Placidia, the daughter of Valentinian III (Western emperor 425â€“455). Gaiseric, king of the Vandals, a Germanic people who maintained a kingdom in North Africa, hoped that Olybrius would be made Western emperor but his support made Olybrius suspect to the Eastern Roman emperor Leo I. Leo sent Olybrius from Constantinople to Rome, hoping he would be killed by the reigning Western emperor, Anthemius; but the Roman general Flavius Ricimer, known as a kingmaker, elevated him to the throne soon after his arrival (April 472). Anthemius was overthrown and put to death in July 472. Ricimer died in August and his puppet king Olybrius lived only until November. Leo never recognized Olybrius as a legitimate ruler.
