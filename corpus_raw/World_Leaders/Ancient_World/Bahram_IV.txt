Bahrām IV,  (flourished 4th century ad), Sāsānian king (reigned 388–399).
One of the sons of Shāpūr II, Bahrām first served as governor of Kermān before succeeding his brother Shāpūr III on the throne. Although the partition of Armenia with Rome is frequently ascribed to Bahrām, it probably occurred in 387, during the reign of his brother Shāpūr.
