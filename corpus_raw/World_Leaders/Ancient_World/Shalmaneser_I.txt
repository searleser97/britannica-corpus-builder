Shalmaneser I,  (flourished  13th century bc), king of Assyria (reigned c. 1263–c. 1234 bc) who significantly extended Assyrian hegemony.
While the Hittites warred with Egypt, Shalmaneser invaded Cappadocia (in eastern Asia Minor) and founded an Assyrian colony at Luha. By the defeat of Shattuara of Hani and his Hittite allies and by raids on Carchemish, Irridi, and the Kashiari Hills (all in the region around the borders of northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey), Shalmaneser reopened Assyria’s main northwestern trade routes. At his capital, Ashur, he built a palace and restored one of the temples. His buildings at Nineveh and at Calah (modern Nimrūd), the latter of which he founded, have been partially excavated.
