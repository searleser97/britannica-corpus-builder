Lucius Verginius Rufus,  (born ad 15, Mediolanum [Milan, Italy]—died  97), Roman provincial governor and distinguished official, known for his repeated refusal of the imperial throne.
Verginius was the son of an undistinguished Roman eques (knight). Nevertheless, he enjoyed a successful career under the emperors Claudius and Nero and became consul in ad 63. He was appointed governor of Upper Germany and put down a rebellion against Nero led by the Gallic governor, Gaius Julius Vindex, in a battle at Vesontio (now Besançon) in 68. (He may have been negotiating with Vindex when his enthusiastic troops started fighting.) His troops declared him emperor, but he refused the title. He was reluctant to recognize the claims of Galba, however, preferring to wait for the decision of the Senate. As emperor, Galba removed Verginius from his command, but Galba’s successor, Otho, made him suffect consul in 68 (completing the year started by another consul). When Otho was murdered, Verginius again refused to become emperor. Under the Flavian dynasty he lived a quiet, honourable life of republican leisure. After Domitian’s death, the new emperor, Nerva, made Verginius consul in 97 for the third time, in recognition of his devotion to senatorial ideals. He died during that year after he fell and broke his hip.
The great historian and orator Tacitus delivered his funeral oration. Verginius is praised in a number of letters published in the first decade of the 2nd century by Pliny the Younger, who had become his ward after the death of Pliny’s uncle, Pliny the Elder. When the historian Cluvius asked Verginius to forgive accounts he did not like, Verginius replied, “I did what I did so that the rest of you should be at liberty to write as you please.” He left orders that his tomb bear the inscription “Here lies Rufus, who defeated Vindex and claimed the imperial power, not for himself, but for his country.”
