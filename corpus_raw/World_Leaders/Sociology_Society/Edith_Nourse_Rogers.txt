Edith Nourse Rogers, née Edith Nourse,  (born March 19, 1881, Saco, Maine, U.S.—died Sept. 10, 1960, Boston, Mass.),  American public official, longtime U.S. congressional representative from Massachusetts, perhaps most remembered for her work with veterans affairs.
Edith Nourse was educated at Rogers Hall School in Lowell, Massachusetts, and at Madame Julien’s School in Paris. In 1907 she married John J. Rogers of Lowell. After his election to Congress in 1912, they lived in Washington, D.C. During World War I she was active in volunteer work for the YMCA and the Red Cross, and in 1917 she served abroad for a time with the Women’s Overseas League. Her work in military hospitals, notably Walter Reed Hospital in 1918–22, and her inspections with her husband of field and base hospitals, led to her appointment by President Warren G. Harding as his personal representative to visit veterans and military hospitals throughout the country in 1922.
Rogers served President Calvin Coolidge in a similar capacity in 1923 and President Herbert Hoover in 1929. Following her husband’s death in 1925, she was elected to fill his unexpired term in Congress. In 1926 she was elected to a full term, and she was reelected regularly thereafter, serving in all 35 years as the representative of the Fifth District of Massachusetts. She was the first congresswoman from New England. Her earlier work led naturally to her appointment to the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, of which she was chairman in the 80th and 83rd congresses. She introduced the legislation, passed in March 1942 and in force two months later, that created the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (later the Women’s Army Corps). In 1944 she helped draft the GI Bill of Rights for veterans. She served also on the post office, civil service, and foreign affairs committees.
