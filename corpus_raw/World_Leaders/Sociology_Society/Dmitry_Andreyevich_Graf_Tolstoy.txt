Dmitry Andreyevich, Count Tolstoy,  (born March 13 [March 1, old style], 1823, Moscow—died May 7 [April 25, O.S.], 1889, St. Petersburg, Russian Empire), tsarist Russian government official known for his reactionary policies.
Tolstoy was appointed to the education ministry in 1866, charged with imposing strict discipline on both the students and teachers and keeping them from exposure to revolutionary doctrines that were thought to have become dangerously widespread in the Russian Empire. He also proceeded to undo many of the previous educational reforms. Greek and Latin classical studies were introduced into the curriculum to discipline the students. Entry into the universities became more difficult because only the affluent could afford the preparatory schools teaching the classics. An inspectorate of public schools was founded in 1869 on the initiative of Tolstoy to maintain surveillance and supervision over the morals of the students and teachers and to combat “politically and morally criminal propaganda.” Textbooks and lectures were censored, and teachers were dismissed without a hearing. As president of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, Tolstoy sought to limit the teaching of science. In 1880 he left the Ministry of Education.
Tolstoy became minister of the interior in 1882 and followed a policy of uncompromising reaction and counterreform aimed at revision of the liberal legislation of the 1860s. In August 1882 strict censorship was placed on the press, and some newspapers and periodicals had to submit all copy to official censors before publication. In July 1889 the peasant townships were placed under land captains chosen by the minister of the interior. Land captains had to be members of the landowning nobility, and they appointed the town elders who had the power to fine and arrest the peasants without trial. Tolstoy’s ministry ended when he died in 1889.
