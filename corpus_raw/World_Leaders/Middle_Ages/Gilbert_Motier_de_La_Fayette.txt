Gilbert Motier de La Fayette,  (born c. 1380, Auvergne, Fr.—died  Feb. 23, 1462, Auvergne), marshal of France during the Hundred Years’ War and noted adviser to King Charles VII.
After serving in Italy under Marshal Jean le Meingre Boucicaut in 1409, he became steward of the Bourbonnais. In the wars with England, Jean I, duc de Bourbon, made him lieutenant general in Languedoc and Guyenne. After victories over the English and the Burgundians on the Loire, he was made governor of Dauphiné in 1420 and a marshal of France. Taken prisoner by the English in 1424, he was soon released and served with Joan of Arc at Orléans and Patay in 1429. A member of Charles VII’s great council, he took part in the conferences of Nevers and Arras (1435), which prepared the King’s reconciliation with Burgundy. La Fayette worked to reform the army from 1445 to 1448 and was recalled to military service in 1449 for a campaign against the English in Normandy. He remained a friend and adviser to the King all his life.
