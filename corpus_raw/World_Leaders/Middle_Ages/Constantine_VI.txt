Constantine VI,  (born 770—died after Aug. 15, 797), Byzantine emperor from 780 to 797, grandson of Constantine V.
At 10 years of age Constantine succeeded his father, Leo IV, under the guardianship of his mother, Irene. It was during her regency that the seventh ecumenical Council of Nicaea (787) reestablished the veneration of icons. When Constantine came of age, Irene attempted to retain supreme power; but in 790 the army proclaimed Constantine VI as sole ruler, and she was arrested. Constantine foolishly pardoned her in 792 and again accepted her as coruler. In 796 Constantine roused public opinion by divorcing his wife in order to marry his mistress, Theodote. Irene cleverly utilized this situation and in August 797 had Constantine deposed and blinded. He was the last of the Isaurian dynasty. See also Irene (752–803).
