Ferdinand IV,   (born Sept. 8, 1633—died  July 9, 1654), king of Bohemia (from 1646) and of Hungary (from 1647) and king of the Romans (from 1653).
The eldest son of the emperor Ferdinand III and his first wife, Maria Anna, daughter of Philip III of Spain, Ferdinand was destined for the imperial crown. He was brought up to rule and, at his father’s insistence, was elected king of the Romans at Augsburg on May 31, 1653, and crowned at Ratisbon on June 18. However, Ferdinand died prematurely the next year, at age 21; and, when his father died in 1657, the imperial crown went to Ferdinand III’s younger son, Leopold I, a milder individual who had been destined for the church.
