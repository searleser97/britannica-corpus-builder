Abdülhamid I,  (born March 20, 1725—died April 7, 1789), Ottoman sultan from 1774 to 1789 who concluded the war with Russia by signing the humiliating Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. By the terms of the treaty, Russia obtained the fortresses on the coast of the Sea of Azov, the area between the Dnieper and Bug rivers, and navigation and commercial privileges in the Ottoman Empire. Bukovina was ceded to Austria in 1775. Russia annexed Crimea (an Ottoman vassal state) in 1783 and planned to partition the Ottoman Empire. Confronted with Russian designs, Abdülhamid in 1787 declared war, which was not ended until after his death.
A pious and benevolent man with a keen interest in state affairs, he favoured reform and appointed able grand viziers to whom he entrusted wide powers. He initiated army reforms and opened the Imperial Naval Engineering School. He also endeavoured to strengthen the central government against provincial rulers, particularly in Syria, Egypt, and Iraq.
