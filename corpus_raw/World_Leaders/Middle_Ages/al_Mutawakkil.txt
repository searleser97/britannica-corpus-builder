Al-Mutawakkil,  (born March 822, Iraq—died  December 861, Sāmarrāʾ, Iraq), ʿAbbāsid caliph who, as a young man, held no political or military positions of importance but took a keen interest in religious debates that had far-reaching political importance.
When he succeeded al-Wāthiq as caliph in 847, al-Mutawakkil reverted to a position of Islamic orthodoxy and began a persecution of all non-orthodox or non-Muslim groups. Synagogues and churches in Baghdad were torn down, while the shrine of al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī (a Shīʿī martyr) in Karbalāʾ was razed, and further pilgrimages to the town were forbidden. Old regulations prescribing special dress for Christians and Jews were reinstated with new vigour.
Al-Mutawakkil was less successful in dealing with external enemies. He constantly had to dispatch expeditions to deal with rebellions in the provinces, although he suffered no important losses of territory. Warfare against the Byzantines continued its intermittent course and was likewise indecisive. Al-Mutawakkil continued the dangerous policy of depending upon Turkish soldiers, who eventually murdered him at the instigation of his eldest son, al-Muntasir, who had become estranged from him and feared to lose the succession.
