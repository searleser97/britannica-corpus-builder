Anastasius II, original name Artemis,  (died 721), Byzantine emperor from 713 to 715.
He was chosen to take the throne after an army coup deposed Philippicus, whose secretary he had been. Anastasius reversed the ecclesiastical policies of Philippicus and tried to reform the army before he, too, was deposed. Assuring Pope Constantine of his orthodoxy, Anastasius withdrew Philippicus’ monothelite decrees, which had imposed the heretical doctrine of a single will of Christ. Militarily, he fortified Constantinople, selected the island of Rhodes as a Byzantine naval base, and sent the Isaurian Leo, the future emperor Leo III, to defend Syria against the Arabs. In the meantime, troops in the Opsikian province rebelled and proclaimed as emperor Theodosius, a local tax collector, who was seated (715) in Constantinople after a six-month civil war. Anastasius fled and became a monk in Thessalonica in 716. Failing in an attempt to regain his throne in 720, he was executed by Theodosius’ successor, Leo III.
