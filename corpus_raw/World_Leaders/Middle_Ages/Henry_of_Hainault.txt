Henry of Hainault, byname Henry of Hainaut or Henry of Flanders, French Henri de Hainaut or Henri de Flandre,  (born c. 1174, Valenciennes, Hainaut [modern Valenciennes, France]—died June 11, 1216, Thessalonica, Macedonia [modern Thessaloníki, Greece]), second and most able of the Latin emperors of Constantinople, who reigned from 1206 to 1216 and consolidated the power of the new empire.
Son of Baldwin V, count of Hainaut, and younger brother of Baldwin I, the first Latin emperor, Henry began the conquest of Asia Minor in 1204 and was on the point of crushing the Byzantine loyalist leader Theodore I Lascaris when a Bulgarian invasion of Thrace necessitated his return to Europe. After the death of Baldwin at the hands of Kalojan, the Bulgarian tsar, in 1205, he served as regent and was made emperor of the Latin empire in August 1206. Henry defeated the Bulgars in Europe and between 1209 and 1211 held the forces of Theodore Lascaris at bay. In 1214 he forced Theodore, who had made himself emperor at Nicaea (now İznik, Turkey) to sign a treaty at Nymphaeum defining the borders of their two realms and ceding the northwestern portions of Asia Minor to Henry. He also made an alliance through marriage with the Bulgarian tsar Boril. Thus, through diplomacy he was able to ensure the security of the Latin empire. An enlightened ruler, he strove to reconcile his Greek subjects to what they regarded as the disgrace of Latin rule. His refusal to cede Greek church lands to the papacy caused a dispute with Pope Innocent III.
Henry died, possibly poisoned, in the 10th year of his reign and was succeeded by Peter of Courtenay. No capable rulers followed Henry, and the Latin empire declined.
