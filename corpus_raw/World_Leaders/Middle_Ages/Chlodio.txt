Chlodio, also spelled Chlogio,  French Chlodion,  (died c. 447), king of a tribe of Salian Franks, considered the founder of the Merovingian dynasty. Chlodioâ€™s tribe renounced the suzerainty of Rome and spread southward into Gaul until they reached Cambrai. Their defeat (c. 431) by the Roman general Aetius at Helena in the area of Arras prevented further expansion. Chlodio occupied territory as far south as the Somme River. His successor was his relative Merovech.
