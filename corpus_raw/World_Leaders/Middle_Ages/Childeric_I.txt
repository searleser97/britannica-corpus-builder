Childeric I,   (died 481/482), king of the Salian Franks, one of the first of the Merovingians and the father of Clovis I.
The Salian Franks, in treaty with the Roman Empire, had settled in Belgica Secunda, between the Meuse and Somme rivers, making their capital at Tournai. Childeric’s role as a barbarian ally of the Romans was important. He helped the Roman military commander Aegidius to repel the Visigoths near Orléans (463); at the request of Aegidius’ successor, Count Paulus, he attacked the Visigoths again in 469. Soon afterward he cleared Anglo-Saxon pirates from the district southwest of Orléans around Angers. Childeric’s tomb at Tournai was discovered in 1653.
