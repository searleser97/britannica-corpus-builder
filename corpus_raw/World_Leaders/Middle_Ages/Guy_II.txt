Guy II, byname Guy of Spoleto,  Italian Guido di Spoleto, French Gui de Spolète,  (died 894), duke of Spoleto, who was claimant to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire in the chaotic end of the Carolingian era.
His father, Guy I, duke of Spoleto, had come to Italy in the entourage of Lothar I and had successfully expanded his family’s power in central and southern Italy. Eventually succeeding to the duchy, Guy II failed in his bid for the throne of the West Franks in 888, despite the support of Archbishop Fulk of Reims. He was successful, however, in defeating Berengar, king of Italy (889), and in forcing the pope to crown him as the first non-Carolingian Holy Roman emperor in 891. He is usually not counted in the lists of emperors.
