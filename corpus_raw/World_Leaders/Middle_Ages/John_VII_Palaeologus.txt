John VII Palaeologus, Palaeologus also spelled Palaiologos,  (born c. 1370—died September 1408, Thessalonica, Byzantine Empire [modern Thessaloníki, Greece]), Byzantine emperor who reigned for several months in 1390 by seizing control of Constantinople from his grandfather, the emperor John V Palaeologus.
From 1399 to 1403 he acted as regent for John V’s successor, Manuel II, at Constantinople while Manuel journeyed to the West to appeal for help against Turkish attacks. During Manuel’s absence John arranged a treaty with the Ottoman Turks, granting them financial and religious privileges. Manuel disavowed the treaty on his return and sent John to be governor of Thessalonica.
