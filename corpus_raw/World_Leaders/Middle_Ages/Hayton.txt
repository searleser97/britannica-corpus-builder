Hayton, also spelled Haithon, or Hethum,  (died 1271), king of Little Armenia, now in Turkey, from 1224 to 1269; the account of his travels in western and central Asia, written by Kirakos Gandzaketsi, a member of his suite, gives one of the earliest and most comprehensive accounts of Mongolian geography and ethnology.
Throughout his reign Hayton followed a policy of friendship and alliance with the powerful Mongols and in 1251 was summoned to the court of Möngke, the new khan at Karakorum, Mongolia. Disguised so as to pass safely through the Turkish states of the interior of eastern Asia Minor, where he was hated as an ally of the Mongols against Islām, he made his way to the Mongol camp at Kars, Greater Armenia, now in Turkey. After he passed through the Iron Gates of Derbent around the western shore of the Caspian Sea, comparatively little is known of the long journey to Karakorum, which he reached about Sept. 14, 1254. He left on November 1, with documents, seals, and letters of enfranchisement filled with promises for the betterment of the Armenian state, church, and people. His return journey by way of Samarkand and northern Persia brought him to Greater Armenia in just eight months. The narrative of his travels concludes with some observations of Buddhist tenets, Chinese habits, and some notes, compounded of truth and legend, on the wild tribes and animals of the Gobi (desert) and adjoining regions.
