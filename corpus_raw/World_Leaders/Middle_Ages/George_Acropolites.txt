George Acropolites, Acropolites also spelled Akropolites,  (born 1217, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died 1282, Constantinople), Byzantine scholar and statesman, the author of Chronike Syngraphe (“Written Chronicle”), a history of the Byzantine Empire from 1203 to 1261. He also played a major diplomatic role in the attempt to reconcile the Greek and Latin churches.
Acropolites was reared at the imperial court, then at Nicaea in Asia Minor. Entrusted with important state missions under the emperor John III Ducas Vatatzes and his successors Theodore II Lascaris and Michael VIII Palaeologus, he was in 1255 made grand logothete (chancellor). Named governor of the western provinces by Theodore II, Acropolites was engaged (1256) as commander in the field against Michael Angelus, despot of Epirus. He was later captured but released, and he returned to Constantinople when it was retaken from the Crusaders (1261). He represented Michael VIII in the negotiations for the reunion of the Western and Byzantine churches that led to the Second Council of Lyon (1274), at which, in the emperor’s name, he acknowledged the supremacy of Rome. In 1282 he was sent on an embassy to John II, emperor of Trebizond (Trabzon), and died soon after his return.
Acropolites’ history of the Byzantine Empire reveals his firsthand knowledge of the events of his day. He also wrote theological and rhetorical works as well as some poems.
