Theodora,  (born 981?, Constantinople [now Istanbul, Tur.]—died  Aug. 31, 1056, Constantinople), Byzantine empress who reigned jointly with her sister Zoe in 1042 and on her own in 1055–56.
The third daughter of the emperor Constantine VIII, Theodora possessed a strong and austere character and refused the hand of the heir presumptive, Romanus, who was married instead to her sister Zoe (1028). Though living in retirement, she excited Zoe’s jealousy and, accused of complicity in a conspiracy, was confined in a monastery. In 1042 the popular movement that caused the dethronement of Michael V also led to Theodora’s installment as joint empress with her sister. After two months of active participation in government she allowed herself to be virtually superseded by Zoe’s new husband, Constantine IX. Upon his death in 1055, in spite of her 70 years, she reasserted her dormant rights with vigour and frustrated an attempt to supersede her on behalf of the general Nicephorus Bryennius. By her firm administration she controlled the unruly nobles and checked numerous abuses; but she marred her reputation by excessive severity toward private enemies. She also angered the patriarch Michael I Cerularius by appointing clerics, which was held to be inappropriate for a woman. She approved the succession of Michael VI as emperor on her deathbed.
