Baldwin I, byname Baldwin of Boulogne, French Baudouin de Boulogne,  (born 1058?—died April 2, 1118, Al-ʿArīsh, Egypt), king of the Crusader state of Jerusalem (1100–18) who expanded the kingdom and secured its territory, formulating an administrative apparatus that was to serve for 200 years as the basis for Frankish rule in Syria and Palestine.
Son of Eustace II, count of Boulogne, and Ida d’Ardenne, Baldwin was the younger brother of Godfrey of Bouillon, whom he accompanied on the First Crusade (1096–99). While Baldwin was campaigning against the Seljuq Turks in Anatolia, Toros, the Christian prince of Edessa (now Urfa, Turkey), promised to make him his heir in return for military aid. Baldwin forced Toros to abdicate and took possession of Edessa in 1098. He consolidated his new principality and strengthened its ties with the native Armenians by marrying Arda, the daughter of an Armenian noble.
In July 1100 his brother Godfrey died in Jerusalem, and Baldwin was summoned by the nobles to succeed him as Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (Defender of the Holy Sepulchre). In December, after leading a campaign in the south to impress the Egyptian Fāṭimids with his strength and after subduing the opposition of the Crusader nobles, he was crowned the first king of Jerusalem.
Once he had consolidated his strength at home, Baldwin seized the coastal cities of Arsuf (Tel Arshaf, Israel) and Caesarea (H̱orbat Qesari, Israel) in 1101; by 1112 he had captured all the coastal cities except Ascalon and Tyre. In 1115 he built the castle of Krak de Montréal to protect the kingdom in the south.
In 1113 Baldwin forced his wife to enter a convent and married Adelaide of Saona, countess dowager of Sicily. He died without an heir and was succeeded by Baldwin of Bourcq, a cousin whom he had named count of Edessa in 1100.
