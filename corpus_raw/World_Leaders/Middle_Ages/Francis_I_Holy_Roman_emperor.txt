Francis I,  (born Dec. 8, 1708, Nancy, Duchy of Lorraine—died  Aug. 18, 1765, Innsbruck, Austria), Holy Roman emperor from Sept. 13, 1745; he was duke of Lorraine (as Francis Stephen) from 1729 to 1735 and grand duke of Tuscany from 1737. Although nominally outranking his wife, Maria Theresa, archduchess of Austria and queen of Hungary and Bohemia, the capable but easygoing Francis always was overshadowed by her strong personality.
From 1723 Francis, whose dynasty in Lorraine was closely connected with the Austrian Habsburgs, lived at the Viennese court of the Holy Roman emperor Charles VI. His marriage to Maria Theresa, who was Charles’s heiress, took place on Feb. 12, 1736. Charles consented to it only on condition that Francis make the sacrifice required by the French in order to end the War of the Polish Succession, namely, the cession of Lorraine to Stanisław Leszczyński (Stanisław I), for whom the French had failed to secure Poland. In compensation, Francis was allowed to succeed the childless Gian Gastone, last of the Medici grand dukes of Tuscany. These arrangements were confirmed by the 1738 Treaty of Vienna.
When Maria Theresa succeeded Charles VI (Oct. 20, 1740), she immediately appointed her husband coregent. During the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48), Maria Theresa, apprehensive for Francis’ life, refused his repeated demands to be allowed to defend her inheritance by leading the Austrian Army. During the war he was elected Holy Roman emperor after the death of the emperor Charles VII (the elector Charles Albert of Bavaria), who was one of his wife’s chief adversaries. The influence of Francis in government was inconsiderable except in economic matters. He is better remembered for his cultural interests. Maria Theresa mourned his death throughout the 15 years by which she survived him.
