Maximilian, count von Trauttmansdorff,  (born May 23, 1584, Graz, Austria—died  June 8, 1650, Vienna), Austrian statesman, confidant of the emperors Ferdinand II and Ferdinand III, chief imperial plenipotentiary during the negotiations of the Peace of Westphalia, and one of the foremost political figures of early 17th-century Europe.
After participating in the Austrian war against the Turks (1593–1606) and in Spanish counterinsurgency activity in the Netherlands, he was named to the Council of War (Hofkriegsrat) by the Habsburg emperor Matthias (reigned 1612–19). Later, he proved instrumental in securing the crowns of Bohemia and Hungary (1617–18) and ultimately the imperial title (1619) for Archduke Ferdinand of Styria, thereafter Emperor Ferdinand II. During the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48) he worked for a quick conclusion of the peace with Lutheran Germany, his efforts finally issuing in the Peace of Prague (1635).
Trauttmansdorff became chief minister of Ferdinand II in 1634 and exercised paramount influence over the policies of Ferdinand III (reigned 1637–57). Through the five years of negotiations of the Peace of Westphalia, which in 1648 ended the Thirty Years’ War, he consistently guarded the Austrian dynastic interests and, at the same time, was probably the most influential diplomat in contributing to the peace settlement.
