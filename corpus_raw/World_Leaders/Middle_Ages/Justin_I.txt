Justin I,  (born c. 450, Bederiana, Macedonia Salurtaris—died  Aug. 1, 527), Byzantine emperor (from 518) who was a champion of Christian orthodoxy; he was the uncle and predecessor of the great emperor Justinian.
Born of Illyrian peasant stock, Justin was a swineherd in his youth. At about the age of 20 he went to Constantinople, where he entered the palace guard and rose to be a patrician. Under the Byzantine emperor Anastasius I he became commander of the palace guard, with the title of count.
On the death of Anastasius in July 518, Justin secured the throne. Unlike his predecessor, he supported orthodoxy, and in 518–519 he was instrumental in ending the Acacian schism with Rome and persecuted the dissident Monophysites. In 523 he also issued an edict against Arianism. This offended the Arian king Theodoric of the Ostrogoths, who forced Pope John I to visit Constantinople to plead for a mitigation of the edict. Justin then granted some concessions to the Arians but not enough to satisfy Theodoric.
In the East the struggle with Persia made it important to retain control of Lazica (modern Colchis, a region in Georgia), to secure allies in Mesopotamia and southern Syria, and to counter Persian penetration into Arabia by an understanding with Ethiopia. On the northern frontier the Slavs were already crossing the Danube River and troubling the Balkan provinces, and Justin proved unable to repel them.
Throughout his reign, Justin, though by no means the nonentity often supposed, had the help of his gifted nephew Justinian I. Justinian was formally recognized as his co-emperor only a few months before Justin’s death.
