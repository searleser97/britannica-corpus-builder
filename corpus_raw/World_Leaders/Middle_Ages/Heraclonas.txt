Heraclonas, also spelled Heracleonas,  (born 615—died  641?), Byzantine emperor for a brief period in 641 who was accused, probably falsely, of complicity in the death of his half brother, Constantine III.
Heraclonas was the son of the Byzantine emperor Heraclius and his second wife, Martina. In 638, through his mother’s influence, he obtained the title of augustus, and, after Heraclius’ death, was proclaimed joint emperor with his half brother, Constantine III. The premature death of Constantine in May 641 left him sole ruler.
Although Constantine probably died of tuberculosis, rumours that he had been poisoned on the orders of Martina and Heraclonas led to a revolt and to the mutilation and banishment to Rhodes of the supposed offenders in September 641. Nothing is known of Heraclonas following that event.
