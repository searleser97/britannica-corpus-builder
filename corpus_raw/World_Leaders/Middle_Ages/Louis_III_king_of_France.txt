Louis III,   (born 863—died  Aug. 5, 882, Saint-Denis, Fr.), king of France (i.e., Francia Occidentalis, the West Frankish kingdom) from 879 to 882, whose decisive victory over the Northmen in August 881, at Saucourt, Ponthieu, briefly stemmed the incursions of the Scandinavian invaders into northern France.
After the death of their father, Louis II the Stammerer, on April 10, 879, Louis and his brother Carloman agreed at Amiens in 880 to a partition of the kingdom, by which Louis received Francia and Neustria. Invasions instigated by dissident West Frankish nobles and by Louis the Younger, one of the East Frankish kings, were bought off by the cession of western Lotharingia (Treaties of Verdun, 879, and of Ribémont, 880). In 880–881 Louis and his brother made a concerted but unsuccessful campaign against the usurper Boso of Provence.
The pagan Northmen, whose frequent raids had turned to conquest, were the greatest menace faced by Louis III; Amiens, Arras, Cambrai, and the famous monasteries of Saint-Bertin and Corbie were all sacked in 880–881. Louis’s victory at Saucourt (the memory of which was preserved in the chanson de geste called Gormont et Isembart) inflicted heavy losses on the Vikings, but the able and energetic king, not yet 20, died in the following year.
