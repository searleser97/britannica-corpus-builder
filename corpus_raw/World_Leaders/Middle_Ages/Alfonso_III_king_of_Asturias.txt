Alfonso III, byname Alfonso the Great,  Spanish Alfonso El Magno,  (born c. 838—died 910?, Zamora, Leon), king of Asturias from 866 to 910, son of Ordoño I.
Winning a contested succession, he moved his capital forward from Oviedo to the recently restored Roman city of León. Under him, Porto (Oporto) was occupied in 868, and Castile took shape around Burgos, drawing on his Basque allies. He claimed to be reviving the Visigothic monarchy, while making the church of St. James at Santiago de Compostela the shrine of the Christian kingdom. Alfonso’s territorial advances were made possible by the convulsion of the Muslim emirate of Córdoba, in which Arab dominion was challenged by the Berber dissidents. For a time Córdoba itself was endangered, and the triumph of Alfonso was thought imminent. This did not occur, but by the end of the reign Alfonso III had occupied Coimbra, Zamora, and Burgos, settling refugees from the south and doubling the size of his kingdom. He was deposed by his sons in 910 and died in exile. He may have written himself or commissioned the Chronicle of Alfonso III, an important source for early Spanish history.
