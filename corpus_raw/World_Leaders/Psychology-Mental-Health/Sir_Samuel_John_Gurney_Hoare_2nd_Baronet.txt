Sir Samuel Hoare, 2nd Baronet, also called (from 1944) Viscount Templewood of Chelsea,  (born Feb. 24, 1880, London—died  May 7, 1959, London), British statesman who was a chief architect of the Government of India Act of 1935 and, as foreign secretary (1935), was criticized for his proposed settlement of Italian claims in Ethiopia (the Hoare–Laval Plan).
He was the elder son of Sir Samuel Hoare, whose baronetcy he inherited in 1915. He was educated at Harrow and New College, Oxford, and entered Parliament for Chelsea in 1910, retaining the constituency until 1944. During World War I Hoare was a military officer, serving in missions to Russia (1916–17) and Italy (1917–18). After the war, in 1922, he became air minister in Conservative governments, holding the post until 1929 (except for the brief Labour rule in 1924) and helping to build Britain’s air force. From 1931 to 1935, as secretary of state for India, he had the immense task of developing and defending in debate the new Indian constitution. To this end, he is estimated to have answered 15,000 parliamentary questions, made 600 speeches, and read 25,000 pages of reports.
On June 7, 1935, he became foreign secretary and, after the outbreak of the Italo–Ethiopian War, developed with Pierre Laval of France the so-called Hoare–Laval Plan for the partition of Ethiopian land between Italy and Ethiopia (then called Abyssinia). The proposal drew immediate and widespread denunciation, forcing Hoare’s resignation on Dec. 18, 1935.
Hoare came back into the government in June 1936 as first lord of the admiralty and then, in May 1937, under Neville Chamberlain, as home secretary. As one of the inner council that developed the Munich Pact, he became one of its staunchest defenders, further marking him as an appeaser, to the ultimate damage of his reputation. After war broke out and Churchill acceded to the prime ministry in 1940, Hoare’s parliamentary service was at an end. During the war (1940–44) he served as ambassador to Spain. In 1944 he was created Viscount Templewood and shortly thereafter retired from public life.
He authored several works, including The Fourth Seal (1930), Ambassador on Special Mission (1946), The Unbroken Thread (1949), The Shadow of the Gallows (1951), Nine Troubled Years (1954), and Empire of the Air (1957).
