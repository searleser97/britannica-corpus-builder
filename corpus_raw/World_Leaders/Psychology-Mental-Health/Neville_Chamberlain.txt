Neville Chamberlain, in full Arthur Neville Chamberlain,  (born March 18, 1869, Birmingham, Warwickshire, England—died November 9, 1940, Heckfield, near Reading, Hampshire), prime minister of the United Kingdom from May 28, 1937, to May 10, 1940, whose name is identified with the policy of “appeasement” toward Adolf Hitler’s Germany in the period immediately preceding World War II.
The son of the statesman Joseph Chamberlain and younger half brother of Sir Austen Chamberlain, he managed his father’s sisal plantation on Andros Island, Bahamas, and then prospered in the metalworking industry in Birmingham. Chosen lord mayor of that city in 1915, he organized in 1916 a municipal savings bank, the only one in Great Britain. In December 1916 he joined David Lloyd George’s World War I coalition government as director general of national service, but, having insufficient powers, he resigned in August 1917. A Conservative member of the House of Commons from December 1918, Chamberlain served as postmaster general (1922–23), paymaster general of the armed forces (1923), minister of health (1923, 1924–29, and 1931), and chancellor of the Exchequer (1923–24 and 1931–37). He became prime minister on May 28, 1937.
In a futile attempt to sway Fascist Italy away from German influence, he agreed (April 16, 1938) to recognize Italian supremacy in Ethiopia and kept Great Britain out of the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), in which Italy was deeply involved. A few days later (April 25) he also undertook to abandon British naval bases in Ireland, a move opposed by some as weakening Britain’s defense capability.
On three occasions in September 1938, Chamberlain went to Germany in efforts to prevent the outbreak of a general European war over Hitler’s demand that Czechoslovakia cede the Sudetenland to Germany. By the Munich Agreement of September 30, he and Premier Édouard Daladier of France granted almost all of Hitler’s demands and left Czechoslovakia defenseless. He returned to England a popular hero, speaking of “peace with honour” (echoing an earlier prime minister, Benjamin Disraeli) and “peace for our time.” Nonetheless, he immediately ordered the acceleration of the British rearmament program. When Hitler seized the rest of Czechoslovakia (March 10–16, 1939), Chamberlain definitely repudiated appeasement, and he soon published Anglo-French guarantees of armed support for Poland, Romania, and Greece in the event of similar attacks. The next month, peacetime military conscription was instituted for the first time in British history.
The Soviet-German nonaggression treaty (August 23, 1939), frustrating Chamberlain’s plan for a mutual assistance agreement among Great Britain, France, and the U.S.S.R., was followed by an Anglo-Polish pact (August 24). When the Germans attacked Poland (September 1, 1939), Chamberlain countered with a British declaration of war (September 3). He remained prime minister during the “phony war” period of sporadic military action, taking into his war cabinet his foremost critic, Winston Churchill, as first lord of the Admiralty.
After the failure of a British expedition to Norway in April 1940, Chamberlain lost the support of many Conservatives in the House of Commons. He resigned on May 10, the day of the German invasion of the Low Countries. In Churchill’s coalition government he served loyally as lord president of the council until September 30, 1940, when ill health forced him to resign that office and the Conservative Party leadership. He died a few weeks later.
