Édouard Daladier,   (born June 18, 1884, Carpentras, Fr.—died  Oct. 10, 1970, Paris), French politician who as premier signed the Munich Pact (Sept. 30, 1938), an agreement that enabled Nazi Germany to take possession of the Sudetenland (a region of Czechoslovakia) without fear of opposition from either Britain or France.
Daladier was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1919 as a member of the Radical Party from Vaucluse département. Daladier quickly made his mark in Paris. In June 1924 he joined the first Herriot government as the minister of colonies. In the turbulent years from 1925 to 1933 he served in several different Cabinets as minister of war, minister of public instruction, or minister of public works. On Jan. 31, 1933, he formed his own government, but it survived only until October 1933. In January 1934 he formed a second ministry that survived only four weeks. He continued to move in and out of ministerial assignments as he led his Radical Party into the Popular Front coalition with Léon Blum’s Socialists and the Communist Party (1935).
Amid a deteriorating international situation, Daladier, in his effort to avoid war, joined the British prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, in signing the Munich Pact with Adolf Hitler’s Germany. When France fell to Germany (June 1940), Daladier was one of those who sought to escape to French North Africa to set up a government-in-exile, but in Morocco he was arrested on Vichy orders and brought back to France. At his trial in Riom in February 1942, he and the other defendants accused the Philippe Pétain group of partial responsibility for the failure to prepare for war. He thereafter was handed over to the Germans, whose prisoner he remained until 1945. After the war he returned to the Chamber of Deputies (1946–58), became president of the moribund Radical Party in 1953, and opposed de Gaulle’s new constitution of 1958. He then left politics.
