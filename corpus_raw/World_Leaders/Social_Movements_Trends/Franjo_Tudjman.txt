Franjo Tudjman,  (born May 14, 1922, Veliko Trgovisce, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes [now Croatia]—died December 10, 1999, Zagreb, Croatia), Croat politician who led the country to independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 and who was president until his death.
Having joined the Partisans in 1941, Tudjman launched a military career in the Yugoslav army, rose quickly in rank, and in 1960 became one of its youngest generals. The following year he left military service and became the director of the Institute for the History of the Workers’ Movement. He received a doctorate in history from the University of Zagreb’s faculty of arts in Zadar (now the University of Zadar) in 1965.
Tudjman was outspoken on nationalist issues, including the charge that Yugoslav authorities had inflated the crimes committed by Croatian Nazis (Ustaša) during World War II. His criticism of the government led to his expulsion from the Communist Party in 1967 and dismissal from his job, and twice, in 1972 and in 1981, he was sentenced to prison terms for antigovernment activities.
In 1989 Tudjman founded the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), which won Croatia’s first free parliamentary elections in 1990. Named president, he pressed for the creation of a homogenous Croat state. When Serb areas of Eastern and Western Slavonia and the Krajina revolted, they were occupied by the Yugoslav army. Beginning in 1995, Tudjman reasserted control over these areas and established virtual control over portions of Bosnia and Herzegovina with majority Croat populations. Although he signed the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement on Bosnia, his authoritarian style, along with his refusal to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, led to the international isolation of Croatia.
