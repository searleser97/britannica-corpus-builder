Kitabatake Chikafusa,  (born 1293, Japan—died May 10, 1354, Anō, Yamato Province, Japan), Japanese warrior, statesman, and author of the influential politico-historical treatise Jinnō shōtōki (“Record of the Legitimate Succession of the Divine Emperors”), which set forth the mystic and nationalist doctrine that Japan had a unique superiority among nations because of its unbroken succession of divine rulers.
Kitabatake served as adviser to the emperor Go-Daigo when that monarch returned from exile in 1333 to reclaim the throne he had lost to a warring feudal faction. Go-Daigo’s brief restoration ended with a revolt against the throne and the establishment of two courts, the northern court at Kyōto and the southern court of Go-Daigo at Yoshino.
This situation led to the writing of Kitabatake’s Jinnō shōtōki, which attempted to prove that Go-Daigo and his line were the legitimate heirs to the Japanese throne. Written in 1339 and published in 1369, this book influenced the revival in later centuries of the nationalistic Shintō religion and was of seminal importance in the rise of modern Japanese nationalism. In his own time Kitabatake was considered the chief military and administrative supporter of the southern court and a model of loyalty as well.
