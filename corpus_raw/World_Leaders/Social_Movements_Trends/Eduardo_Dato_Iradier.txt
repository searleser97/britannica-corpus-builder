Eduardo Dato Iradier,  (born August 12, 1856, La Coruña, Spain—died March 8, 1921, Madrid), Spanish statesman, leader of the Conservative Party from 1913 to 1921, and three-time premier. He instituted various reforms but proved unable to deal effectively with unrest or to heal the divisions within his party.
As undersecretary in the Home Office in 1892 and as minister in 1899, Dato sponsored a workers’ compensation act and bills to regulate female employment. He was minister of justice in 1902 and mayor of Madrid in 1907. He became premier in 1913, when Antonio Maura, the party’s leader, refused to form a government. Dato’s assumption of leadership produced a rift between Maura and the more moderate Dato that severely weakened the Conservative Party. Dato, who governed until 1915, kept Spain neutral at the outbreak of World War I and allowed the establishment of the Mancomunidad, an organ of limited Catalan self-government. In office again from June to October 1917, he closed the parliament and suspended constitutional guarantees in an effort to combat strikes, unrest, and near-rebellion. Premier again in 1920, he established the ministry of labour, tried unavailingly to restore Conservative Party unity, and strove to control social upheavals in Catalonia, until he was cut down by anarchist assassins near his home.
