Rebecca Ann Felton, née Rebecca Ann Latimer,  (born June 10, 1835, near Decatur, Ga., U.S.—died Jan. 24, 1930, Atlanta, Ga.), American political activist, writer, and lecturer, the first woman seated in the U.S. Senate.
Rebecca Latimer was graduated first in her class from the Madison Female College, Madison, Georgia, in 1852 and the following year married William H. Felton, a local physician active in liberal Democratic politics. She assisted her husband in his political career (as a U.S. congressman and later in the state legislature), writing speeches, planning campaign strategy, and later helping to draft legislation. Together the Feltons promoted penal reform, temperance, and women’s rights. Rebecca Felton was equally outspoken in her prejudice against African Americans and Jews and her advocacy of child labour and lynching, views for which her column in the Atlanta Journal was a popular forum. She served on the board of lady managers of the Chicago Exposition (1893), as head of the women’s executive board of the Cotton States and International Exposition (1894–95) in Atlanta, Georgia, and on the agricultural board at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904) in St. Louis, Missouri.
In 1922 Governor Thomas W. Hardwick of Georgia, in a symbolic gesture, appointed Felton to fill the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the death of Senator Thomas E. Watson, whose antagonism to former President Woodrow Wilson and all of his policies she heartily shared. She served only two days, November 21–22, 1922, before being succeeded by Walter F. George, the duly elected senator. Her writings include My Memoirs of Georgia Politics (1911), Country Life in Georgia in the Days of My Youth (1919), and The Romantic Story of Georgia Women (1930).
