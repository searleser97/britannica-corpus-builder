Duy Tan, original name Vinh San,  (born 1899—died  Dec. 26, 1945), emperor of Vietnam from 1907 to 1916 and symbol of the Vietnamese anticolonialist movement against the French before and during World War I; he became an officer and decorated hero in the French army during World War II.
Vinh San was the son of Emperor Thanh Thai, who was deposed by the French. Seeking a more compliant figure to be their puppet king, the French proclaimed Vinh San emperor on Sept. 5, 1907. Upon his accession, he assumed the name Duy Tan, or reform(s), the Chinese characters of which were the same as the name of a radical nationalist organization, Duy Tan Hoi (“Reformation Society”), founded about that time by the Vietnamese patriots Nguyen Tham and Phan Boi Chau.
Duy Tan was sympathetic to the plans of the Vietnamese liberation leaders, who needed the symbol and sanction of royalty to win popular support. He cooperated with rebel plans to stage revolts in the provinces of Thua Thien, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai in central Vietnam in 1916. Details of the plot, however, leaked to the French. The attacks were unsuccessful, and Duy Tan was caught trying to escape to a mountain sanctuary; on May 13, 1916, he was dethroned by the French and exiled to Réunion island, off the coast of Madagascar, in the Indian Ocean.
During World War II Duy Tan served in Europe with the Free French Army as Major Vinh San. He was among the early followers of the Free French leader General Charles de Gaulle and was awarded the highest French honours for bravery, most importantly cited as “Companion of the French Liberation.” He was killed in an airplane crash and is buried in what is now the Central African Republic.
