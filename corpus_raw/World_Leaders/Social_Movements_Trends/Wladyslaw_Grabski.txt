Władysław Grabski,  (born July 7, 1874, Borowo, near Łowicz, Pol., Russian Empire—died  March 1, 1938, Warsaw), political economist, prime minister of Poland (1920, 1923–25), and statesman who reorganized Poland’s monetary and financial system.
A Socialist in his youth, Grabski later joined the National Democracy Party and was elected a member of three successive sessions of the Duma (1906–12), the legislative body of the Russian Empire, of which Poland was then a part. After Poland had become detached from Russia, Grabski was elected to the Polish constituent assembly (January 1919) but was soon sent to join the Polish delegation at the peace conference in Paris. Returning to Warsaw, he became minister of agriculture in December 1919. From June 23 to July 24, 1920, he was prime minister and in this capacity went to Spa, Belg., to ask the Allied Supreme Council for immediate aid in arms and munitions to enable Poland to defend itself against Soviet Russia. He served as minister of the treasury in the Cabinet of National Defense until November 1920 and again from January to September 1923. On Dec. 19, 1923, he became prime minister again. He succeeded in stabilizing the Polish economy by the creation of a new Polish currency (Feb. 1, 1924), the gold-based złoty, to stop inflation, and the foundation of the Bank of Poland (April 15, 1924). In the summer of 1925, however, he was faced with a new crisis. Germany launched a “tariff war” on Poland, and the Deutsche Bank sold large quantities of the new Polish currency in the money markets of Berlin and Vienna. The złoty lost almost 50 percent of its original gold value, prices rose, and unemployment increased, forcing Grabski’s resignation on Nov. 13, 1925. After General Józef Piłsudski’s coup d’etat of May 1926, Grabski retired from active politics, becoming a professor at the Warsaw Agricultural School.
His numerous published works included his own account of his greatest achievement, Dwa lata pracy u podstaw państwowości naszej, 1924–25 (1927; “Two Years’ Work at the Foundation of Our State, 1924–25”), and a summary of his democratic political philosophy, Idea Polski (1935; “Poland’s Mission”). His most important writings were collected posthumously in Myśli o Rzeczypospolitej (1988; “Thoughts on the Republic”).
