Nikolay Khristyanovich Bunge,  (born Nov. 11 [Nov. 23, New Style], 1823, Kiev, Ukraine, Russian Empire [now in Ukraine]—died  June 3 [June 15], 1895, Tsarskoe Selo, near St. Petersburg, Russia), liberal Russian economist and statesman. As minister of finance (1881–87), he implemented reforms aimed at modernizing the Russian economy, notably tax law changes estimated to have reduced the tax burden on the peasantry by one-fourth.
A professor of political economy, Bunge held various academic posts, becoming rector of the University of Kiev in 1859. His writings on serfdom and finance attracted the attention of the government, and after 1859 he served in several official positions, becoming assistant minister of finance for trade in 1878.
As finance minister, Bunge attempted to upgrade and expand the Russian railroad system, purchasing some failing private lines and urging the construction of new routes. During his tenure rolling stock was standardized, and rates and schedules were coordinated.
An administrator of Gosbank, the Russian state bank, Bunge advocated measures intended to strengthen the Russian banking system. He organized the Peasants’ Land Bank in 1883 to enable peasants to purchase land. The undercapitalized bank enjoyed only marginal success, however. Bunge also implemented several labour laws, including measures restricting child labour. An opponent of Marxism, Bunge was regarded as a bourgeois reformer by Soviet historians.
