Suzuki Bunji,  (born Sept. 4, 1885, Miyagi prefecture, Japan—died  March 12, 1946, Sendai, Miyagi prefecture), Japanese Christian who was one of the primary organizers of the labour movement in Japan. An early convert to Christianity, Suzuki, like many of his co-religionists, soon became active in the struggle for democracy and socialism in his country.
After working briefly as a newspaper reporter, he began a movement in 1911 to combine the many small labour unions that had sprung up with Japan’s burgeoning industrialization. At first Suzuki’s efforts were limited to the development of a labour school attached to the Unitarian Church of Tokyo. By 1919, however, he had formed the Japanese Federation of Labour (Nippon Rōdō Sōdōmei); management then attempted to create a counter-organization, the Harmonization Society (Kyōchōkai). But in 1921 Suzuki’s group scored its first big success: 30,000 dock workers at Kōbe went on strike for several months. As a result, the whole labour movement expanded greatly and became a recognized power within Japan.
Another victory for Suzuki was the manhood suffrage act, which was passed in 1925. He then helped organize the new Social Democratic Party and was elected to the Diet several times as its representative. But Marxist influence began to grow among workers and intellectuals, and the Japanese labour movement soon moved far to the left of Suzuki’s moderate position.
