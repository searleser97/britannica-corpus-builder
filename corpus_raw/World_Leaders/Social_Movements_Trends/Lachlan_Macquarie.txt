Lachlan Macquarie,  (born January 31, 1761, Ulva, Argyllshire, Scotland—died July 1, 1824, London, England), early governor of New South Wales, Australia (1810–21), who expanded opportunities for Emancipists (freed convicts) and established a balance of power with the Exclusionists (large landowners and sheep farmers).
Macquarie joined the British army as a boy and served in North America, Europe, and the West Indies between 1776 and 1784 and in India during 1788–1803 and 1805–07. He was appointed governor of New South Wales in 1809 and took office early the next year, replacing the New South Wales Corps that had overthrown the previous governor, William Bligh. He began a program of public works construction and town planning; by 1822 he had sponsored more than 200 works, many of them designed by the Emancipist architect Francis Greenway. Macquarie introduced the colony’s own currency in 1813 and helped establish its first bank in 1817. He encouraged expansion of settlement and exploration, most notably the crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813. His policy toward the Aborigines was the most liberal since that of the colony’s first governor, Arthur Phillip.
Macquarie’s belief in development based on Emancipist agriculture angered the colony’s large landowners, headed by John Macarthur, and led to a British government investigation (1819), Macquarie’s recall in 1821, and his retirement to his estate on Mull in the Inner Hebrides.
