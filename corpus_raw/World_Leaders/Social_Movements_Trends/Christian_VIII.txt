Christian VIII, in full Christian Frederik,  (born Sept. 18, 1786, Copenhagen—died  Jan. 20, 1848, Amalienborg, Den.), king of Denmark during the rise of the liberal opposition to absolutism in the first half of the 19th century.
While still crown prince of Denmark and recent stadtholder (governor) of Norway, Christian accepted election as king of Norway in 1814 by the Norwegian independence faction, which refused to recognize the cession of Norway to Sweden. After leading a futile resistance against the Swedes, however, Christian was forced to abdicate. Christian’s liberal sympathies emerged clearly in this episode, and, when he returned to Denmark, he was looked upon with suspicion by conservative state officials. He therefore remained out of public affairs until 1831, when he joined the council of state.
Coming to the throne at the death of his father, Frederick VI, in 1839, Christian VIII gave up his earlier liberalism and firmly resisted the demands of the advocates of a constitutional regime. He did, however, reform the prison system and restore the Icelandic Althing (parliament) in 1843. Christian VIII died in 1848, as liberal and nationalistic agitation in Denmark rose to fever heat.
