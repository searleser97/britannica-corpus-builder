Merenre, also spelled Mernere, also called Merenre Antyemsaf,  fourth king of the 6th dynasty (c. 2325–c. 2150 bce) in ancient Egypt, who extended the authority of one official over all Upper Egypt and encouraged intensive exploration and trade in Nubia.
Merenre may have served briefly as coregent with Pepi I (his father) before succeeding to the kingship. During his independent reign he visited the southern boundary of Egypt at Elephantine (present-day Aswān) and received there the homage of the chiefs of Nubia. He shared his father’s interest in the southern regions. Harkhuf, a resident of Elephantine whom Merenre appointed governor of the extreme south, led exploration and trade missions deep into Nubia.
Merenre elevated his father’s trusted minister, Uni, to the post of governor of Upper Egypt, an unprecedented honour that placed all Upper Egypt under a single official. The king also expanded the authority of the son of his father’s vizier over two nomes (administrative districts). These appointments undid a program of diffusion of government authority that had begun in the 5th dynasty (c. 2465–c. 2325 bce). In the process of conducting two major expeditions to Aswān to procure stone for his pyramid, Merenre cut five canals through the cataract rocks and recruited Nubian chieftains to cut timber and to build transport vessels for him. Merenre’s rule was brief, and he probably died at an early age.
