Frédéric-César de La Harpe,  (born April 6, 1754, Rolle, Vaud, Switz.—died  March 30, 1838, Lausanne), Swiss political leader and Vaudois patriot, tutor and confidant to Tsar Alexander I of Russia and a central figure in the creation of the Helvetic Republic (1798).
Resentment of Bernese administration in his native Vaud caused La Harpe to go abroad, and at the Russian imperial court he found employment as tutor to the future tsar Alexander and his brother Constantine (1784). Following the outbreak of the French Revolution, he began to plot a Vaudois uprising from St. Petersburg. In 1794 he returned to Switzerland and thence to Paris, where he sought French assistance for releasing the Vaud from Bern’s domination. In 1797 La Harpe published his Essai sur la constitution du pays de Vaud (“Essay on the Constitution of the Vaud”), an anti-Bernese tract, and on Dec. 9, 1797, on behalf of a group of refugees from the Vaud and Fribourg, he addressed a petition to the French Directory urging military intervention in Switzerland to secure Vaudois independence, thus providing the official pretext for the subsequent French invasion (March 1798). With Peter Ochs he succeeded in creating a unitary government for Switzerland, and on June 29, 1798, he entered the Directory (chief executive organ) of the new Helvetic Republic. After securing the deposition of Ochs (June 1799), La Harpe sought dictatorial power but was himself deposed in the coup of Jan. 7, 1800. Later, accused of conspiracy against the state and anti-French intrigue, he was forced to flee the country. With the fall of Napoleon, he secured from his protector and erstwhile pupil, Tsar Alexander I, a formal promise of Vaudois independence (1814) and made representations on behalf of Switzerland and his native canton at the Congress of Vienna (1815). Returning to the Vaud the following year, he served on its legislative council until 1828.
