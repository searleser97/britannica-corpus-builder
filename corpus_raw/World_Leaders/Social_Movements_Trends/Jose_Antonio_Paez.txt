José Antonio Páez,  (born June 13, 1790, Curpa, near Acarigua, New Granada [now in Venezuela]—died May 6, 1873, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Venezuelan soldier and politician, a leader in the country’s independence movement and its first president. In the crucial early years of Venezuelan independence, he led the country as a dictator.
Páez was a mestizo (mixed American Indian and European ancestry) llanero, one of the horsemen of the plains. Beginning as a ranch hand, he quickly acquired both land and cattle. In 1810 he joined the revolutionary movement against Spain as the leader of a band of llaneros. Becoming chief Venezuelan commander to Simón Bolívar, the liberator of northern South America, Páez and his men helped secure victories at Carabobo (1821) and Puerto Cabello (1823) that resulted in the complete withdrawal of the Spanish. In 1826, after rebelling against the authority of Gran Colombia, of which Venezuela was a province, Páez became the chief military and civil leader of his country. In 1827 he again recognized Bolívar as president of Gran Colombia, but two years later he led the movement that resulted in Venezuela’s becoming a sovereign nation.
Páez was designated provisional president in 1830 and began a constitutional term the following year; thereafter he controlled the country either as chief executive (1831–35; 1839–43) or as a power behind the presidency until the late 1840s. He leveraged his prestige and military prowess to unify the country as it underwent a profound political and economic transformation. Among other actions, he curbed the power of the church in secular affairs but supported its religious authority.
In 1848–49 Páez rebelled unsuccessfully against the rule of Pres. José Tadeo Monagas; he was imprisoned and forced into exile in 1850. He returned to Venezuela during another period of civil unrest in the late 1850s, and in 1861–63 he ruled as a severely repressive dictator, only to be forced again into exile. Páez spent most of his remaining years in New York City, where he published his autobiography in 1867–69. His remains were placed in Venezuela’s Panteón Nacional in 1888.
