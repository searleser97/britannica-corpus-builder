Gotō Shimpei, in full Hakushaku (count) Gotō Shimpei,  (born July 25, 1857, Muzusawa, Rikuchū province, Japan—died  April 13, 1929, Tokyo), statesman, who, together with General Kodama Gentarō, successfully modernized the Taiwanese economy and made the island of Taiwan a financially independent colony of Japan.
After receiving his M.D. degree in Germany, Gotō became a member of the Public Health Bureau in Japan. Imprisoned on a poisoning charge, he was soon released and rose rapidly within the government. After his country’s seizure of Taiwan during the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), he was made the director of the civil administration of the island. He quickly restored order by reestablishing the old Chinese pao-chia system of mutual responsibility and integrating it with a modern police force. He reorganized the colony’s land ownership and taxation system and inaugurated a series of public health measures. He fostered the construction of railways, roads, and ports; helped develop light industry, especially sugar mills; and introduced a unified currency and measurement system. At the same time, he encouraged Japanese social and linguistic dominance of the area. Gotō’s belief in the urgency of Japanese expansion into Asia found further outlet when he was appointed first head of the South Manchurian Railroad in 1906.
Gotō’s success led him to prominence in the Japanese government; he joined the cabinet as minister of communications in 1908 and later served as home and foreign minister and also as mayor of Tokyo.
