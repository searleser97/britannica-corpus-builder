Charles Thomson Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie,  (born November 19, 1838, Hawkhill, Dundee, Scotland—died January 9, 1906, Biarritz, France), British Conservative politician, notable for his reorganization of local government.
Educated at the City of London School, Ritchie pursued a career in business, and in 1874 he was elected to Parliament as Conservative member for the working-class constituency of Tower Hamlets. In 1885 he was made secretary to the Admiralty, and from 1886 to 1892 he served as president of the local government board in Lord Salisbury’s administration, with a seat in the cabinet after 1887, sitting as member for St. George’s-in-the-East. He was responsible for the Local Government Act of 1888, instituting the county councils; and a large section of the Conservative Party always owed him a grudge for having originated the London County Council, which instituted a broad range of social services. In Lord Salisbury’s later ministries, as member for Croydon, Ritchie was president of the Board of Trade (1895–1900) and home secretary (1895–1900); and when Sir Michael Hicks Beach retired in 1902, he became chancellor of the Exchequer in Arthur James Balfour’s cabinet. Though in his earlier years he had been a “fair-trader,” he was strongly opposed to Joseph Chamberlain’s movement for a preferential tariff, and he resigned office in September 1903. In December 1905 he was created a peer.
