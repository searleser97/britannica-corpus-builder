Hussein ibn Ali, also spelled Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, in full Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī al-Hāshimī,  (born c. 1854, Constantinople, Ottoman Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]—died  1931, Amman, Transjordan [now Jordan]), emir of Mecca from 1908 to 1916 and king of the Hejaz from 1916 to 1924.
Hussein was born into the line of Hashemites to which the Meccan emirate had passed in the early 19th century. He became emir in 1908 and, after securing support from Great Britain in a series of letters known as the Hussein-McMahon correspondence, he led the Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule during World War I. In October 1916 he proclaimed himself “king of the Arab countries,” though the Allies formally recognized him only as king of the Hejaz. Hussein was represented at the Versailles peace conference by his third son, Faisal, but refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles (1919) as a protest against the mandatory regimes imposed on Syria, Palestine, and Iraq by France and Great Britain. Subsequently he lacked sufficient support from Great Britain to consolidate his control, while he sowed the seeds of future trouble by deliberately courting the enmity of Ibn Saud. In March 1924 he proclaimed himself caliph, but war with Ibn Saud was imminent, and the Ikhwān attack on Al-Ṭāʾif in September found him unprepared. On October 5 he abdicated. The British conveyed him to Cyprus, where he lived until 1930. He then returned to the Middle East to live with his son Abdullah in Transjordan, where he died in 1931.
Hussein had four sons: Ali, Abdullah, Faisal, and Zeid. Ali succeeded his father in 1924 as second king of the Hejaz, but he abdicated the following year. Abdullah became king of Transjordan (subsequently Jordan), and Faisal became king of Iraq as Faisal I.
