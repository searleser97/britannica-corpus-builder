Taizong, Wade-Giles romanization T’ai-tsung, personal name (xingming) Zhao Jiong, original name Zhao Kuangyi, or Zhao Guangyi,  (born 939, China—died 997, China), temple name (miaohao) of the second emperor of the Song dynasty (960–1279) and brother of the first emperor, Taizu. He completed consolidation of the dynasty. When the Taizu emperor died in 976, the throne was passed to Taizong rather than to the first emperor’s infant son, presumably against the will of the first emperor. This speculation is reinforced in that, after becoming emperor, Taizong, formerly a mild and forbearing man, treated his younger brother and his nephew with such cruelty that they committed suicide.
Three years after assuming the throne, the Taizong emperor took over the two remaining independent states in South China, thereby nearly completing the empire’s unification. But in foreign affairs he was less successful. When he attempted to regain former North Chinese territory between Beijing and the Great Wall, he suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Khitan (Chinese: Qidan) tribes that had occupied the area and assumed the dynastic name of Liao (907–1125). Fighting continued until 1004, when Taizong’s successor agreed to give up claims to that region.
In civil administration Taizong paid particular attention to education, helping to develop the civil-service examination system and to further its use in determining entrance into the bureaucracy. He centralized control more thoroughly than ever before in Chinese history, concentrating great power in the emperor’s hands. He followed the Tang dynasty’s prefectural system and divided China into 15 provinces, each of which was under a governor. By the end of Taizong’s reign, Song rule had become established, and the dynasty had begun its great cultural and economic achievements.
