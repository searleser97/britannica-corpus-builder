Mihail Kogălniceanu,  (born Sept. 6, 1817, Iaşi, Moldavia [now in Romania]—died July 1, 1891, Paris, France), Romanian statesman and reformer, one of the founders of modern Romanian historiography, who became the first premier of Romania, formed by the union of the Danubian principalities Moldavia and Walachia.
In 1840 Kogălniceanu undertook the publication of a national literary review (Dacia literară) and a scientific periodical devoted to history (Arhiva românească), and between 1845 and 1852 he published a three-volume edition of the ancient Moldavian chronicles. In 1843 his lectures in Romanian history delivered at Iaşi were suppressed by the Russian-Turkish government for their nationalistic content. In 1848, after the publication of his nationalist pamphlet “The Wishes of the National Party in Moldavia,” he was forced to seek temporary refuge in Bukovina (then belonging to Austria). A leader in the fight for unification of Moldavia and Walachia, he also distinguished himself as the champion of popular rural reform and the emancipation of the Roma (Gypsies).
Kogălniceanu was appointed prime minister under the first prince of united Romania, Alexandru Ion Cuza, in October 1863. In that office he helped carry out the expropriation of monastic properties, the great land and social reforms of the Agrarian Law of 1864, and other reformist measures. Disagreements with the prince and the landed aristocracy, however, led to his resignation in February 1865. From 1876 to 1880 he held office as foreign minister and represented Romania at the Congress of Berlin (1878).
