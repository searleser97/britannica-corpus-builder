Francisco de Paula Santander,  (born April 2, 1792, Rosario, New Granada [now Colombia]—died  May 6, 1840, Bogotá), soldier and statesman who fought beside Simón Bolívar in the war for South American independence and who served as president of the newly formed New Granada (Colombia) from 1833 until 1837.
Santander left law school in 1810 to join the patriot army and was promoted rapidly. He escaped the Spanish reconquest of 1816 by fleeing to the eastern lowlands and returned in 1819 as brigadier general in Bolívar’s invading force. Santander remained as vice president of New Granada in the Republic of Colombia, or Gran Colombia (which also included Venezuela and Ecuador). During much of the time before 1827, he served as acting president in Bolívar’s absences. Santander proved to be an able statesman, known for his democratic republican principles and efficient procedures. Santander and Bolívar began to clash over political differences soon after New Granada’s independence; a climax was reached in 1826, when Bolívar decided to retain Venezuela in Colombia, a decision of which Santander disapproved.
In 1828 conspirators attacked Bolívar’s palace at San Carlos; he escaped through a window as the intruders entered. Santander was believed to be connected with the plot and was sentenced to death, though it is now thought that he tried to discourage the conspirators. Nothing was proved, and his sentence was therefore commuted to banishment.
After Gran Colombia was dissolved in 1830 and a new constitution was promulgated in 1832, Santander was called back to become president of New Granada on April 1, 1833; his administration was noted for its economy, firmness, and orderliness. His intolerance of Bolívaristas, however, caused some disturbance, and an unsuccessful plot to overthrow him was led by General José Sarda. His presidency ended in 1837, after which he served as senator for New Granada. His death was followed by a two-year civil conflict of major proportions.
