Agenor Romuald, Count Gołuchowski,  (born Feb. 8, 1812, Skała, Austrian Galicia [now Skalat, Ukraine]—died  Aug. 3, 1875, Lemberg, Austrian Poland [now Lviv, Ukraine]), conservative Polish aristocrat and statesman who as Austria’s minister of the interior (or minister of state; August 1859–December 1860) was one of the principal authors of the “October diploma” of 1860, which granted diets to the Habsburg lands and made the empire into a federal state.
Having served in the Galician provisional administration, Gołuchowski was governor of Galicia from 1849 to 1859. Then, as minister of the interior, he secured unprecedented autonomy for Galicia (Austrian Poland) and introduced Polish as an official language in the empire. His support of the “October diploma” reflected his federalist views. As governor of Galicia again (1866–68 and 1871–75), he successfully turned the Poles’ revolutionary spirit into one of cooperation with the Habsburg dynasty in return for concessions to Polish nationalism.
