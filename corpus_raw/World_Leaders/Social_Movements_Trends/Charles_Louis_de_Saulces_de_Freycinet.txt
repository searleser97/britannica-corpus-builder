Charles-Louis de Saulces de Freycinet,   (born Nov. 14, 1828, Foix, Fr.—died  May 15, 1923, Paris), French political figure who served in 12 different governments, including four terms as premier; he was primarily responsible for important military reforms instituted in the last decade of the 19th century.
Freycinet graduated from the École Polytechnique and entered government service as a mining engineer, eventually rising to the position of inspector general of mines in 1883. Upon the establishment of the French Republic in September 1870, during the Franco-German War, he offered his services to Léon Gambetta, who appointed him prefect of Tarnet-Garonne and, in October, chief of the military Cabinet of the provisional government of national defense at Tours. It was largely Freycinet’s powers of organization that enabled Gambetta to muster forces with which to oppose the advancing German armies. Freycinet’s account of his experience, La Guerre en Province pendant le siège de Paris, 1870–1871 (“The War in the Provinces During the Siege of Paris, 1870–71”), was published in 1871.
Freycinet was elected to the Senate in 1876. Joining Jules Dufaure’s government as minister of public works the next year, he directed a policy—often called the Freycinet Plan—whereby the government purchased railroads and built extensive new railways and waterways. In December 1879 he became premier for the first of four terms, but the issue of state support for religious organizations soon brought about the fall of his Cabinet.
Freycinet headed a new government and simultaneously served as foreign minister in January–August 1882; this time it fell because of his decision to occupy the Isthmus of Suez. He was in and out of governments for the next 17 years; in 1887 he lost the presidential election to Sadi Carnot. In April 1888 he became the first civilian war minister since 1848. For the next five years, in five successive governments, including one of his own (1890–92), he directed an impressive reform of the Army, which included the introduction of three-year terms of service, the establishment of a general staff, and the creation of a supreme war council. In January 1893 he was forced to resign as war minister because of a financial scandal over the proposed construction of a Panama canal. He returned to the War Ministry briefly in 1899 and then served as minister without portfolio in 1915–16.
Freycinet became a member of the Académie Française in 1890. In addition to many technical and scientific works, he wrote his memoirs, Souvenirs, 1848–1878 (1912).
