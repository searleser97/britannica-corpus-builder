Émile Combes, in full Justin-Louis-Émile Combes,   (born Sept. 6, 1835, Roquecourbe, France—died  May 25, 1921, Pons), French premier (1902–05) who presided over the separation of church and state in the wake of the Dreyfus affair.
A seminarian in his youth, Combes published his doctoral thesis, La Psychologie de saint Thomas d’Acquin, in 1860, but before ordination he left the church. He studied medicine and settled in Pons, where he was elected mayor in 1875. In 1885 he was elected to the Senate from the Charente-Inférieure département, where he chose to sit with the anticlerical Radical Party.
In 1895 Combes joined the Léon Bourgeois government as minister of education. When he left that post (April 1896), he remained active in politics and supported Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau’s efforts to redefine the relationship between church and state.
Combes succeeded Waldeck-Rousseau as premier in 1902 and agreed to laws exiling almost all religious orders from France and dismantling major aspects of the church’s public functions, especially in education. These decisions precipitated a break in diplomatic relations between France and the Holy See.
When the Act of Separation (December 1905) was formally adopted, Combes had already fallen from power, the victim of the affaire des fiches de délation (“affair of the cards of denunciation”) in which his war minister, the militant anticlerical General Louis André, was accused of receiving reports on suspected reactionary and clerical army officers from Masonic groups.
Combes wrote Une Campagne laïque (1904; “A Secular Campaign”), Une Deuxième Campagne laïque (1905; “A Second Secular Campaign”), and Mon ministère (1906; “My Ministry”). Widely admired by many republicans, he was called to serve as minister without portfolio by his former colleague Aristide Briand in October 1915, despite his advanced age.
