L.S. Amery, in full Leopold Charles Maurice Stennett Amery,  (born Nov. 22, 1873, Gorakhpur, India—died  Sept. 16, 1955, London, Eng.), British politician who was a persistent advocate of imperial preference and tariff reform and did much for colonial territories. He is also remembered for his part in bringing about the fall of the government of Neville Chamberlain in 1940.
Amery was educated at Harrow and at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1899–1900 he was chief correspondent for The Times from the South African War and remained on the staff of that paper until 1909, editing The Times History of the South African War, 7 vol. (1900–09). He entered Parliament in 1911. He became undersecretary of state for the colonies in 1919 and was moved to a junior post at the Admiralty in 1921.
Amery was made a privy councillor in 1922; and thereafter, apart from a term as first lord of the Admiralty (1922–24), he spent the rest of his career as a minister in imperial departments. In 1925 he created the Dominions Office, which later became the Commonwealth Relations Office. He was excluded from office by the national government (1931–40) and was a sharp critic of the Munich Agreement with Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. In 1940 Amery’s voice was influential in breaking the Chamberlain government, to which he applied Oliver Cromwell’s injunction to the Long Parliament: “In the name of God, go!” From 1940 to 1945 he was secretary of state for India and Burma (Myanmar).
