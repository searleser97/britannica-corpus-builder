Menachem Begin, in full Menachem Wolfovitch Begin,  (born August 16, 1913, Brest-Litovsk, Russia [now in Belarus]—died March 9, 1992, Tel Aviv–Yafo, Israel), Zionist leader who was prime minister of Israel from 1977 to 1983. Begin was the corecipient, with Egyptian Pres. Anwar el-Sādāt, of the 1978 Nobel Prize for Peace for their achievement of a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt that was formally signed in 1979.
Begin received a law degree from the University of Warsaw in 1935. Active in the Zionist movement throughout the 1930s, he became (1938) the leader of the Polish branch of the Betar youth movement, dedicated to the establishment of a Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan River. When the Germans invaded Warsaw in 1939, he escaped to Vilnius; his parents and a brother died in concentration camps. The Soviet authorities deported Begin to Siberia in 1940, but in 1941 he was released and joined the Polish army in exile, with which he went to Palestine in 1942.
Begin joined the militant Irgun Zvai Leumi and was its commander from 1943 to 1948. After Israel’s independence in 1948 the Irgun formed the Ḥerut (“Freedom”) Party with Begin as its head and leader of the opposition in the Knesset (Parliament) until 1967. Begin joined the National Unity government (1967–70) as a minister without portfolio and in 1973 became joint chairman of the Likud (“Unity”) coalition.
On May 17, 1977, the Likud Party won a national electoral victory and on June 21 Begin formed a government. He was perhaps best known for his uncompromising stand on the question of retaining the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which had been  occupied by Israel during the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. Prodded by U.S. Pres. Jimmy Carter, however, Begin negotiated with Pres. Anwar el-Sādāt of Egypt for peace in the Middle East, and the agreements they reached, known as the Camp David Accords (September 17, 1978), led directly to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt that was signed on March 26, 1979. Under the terms of the treaty, Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula, which it had occupied since the 1967 war, to Egypt in exchange for full diplomatic recognition. Begin and Sādāt were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1978.
Begin formed another coalition government after the general election of 1981. Despite his willingness to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt under the terms of the peace agreement, he remained resolutely opposed to the establishment of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In June 1982 his government mounted an invasion of Lebanon in an effort to oust the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from its bases there. The PLO was driven from Lebanon, but the deaths of numerous Palestinian civilians there turned world opinion against Israel. Israel’s continuing involvement in Lebanon, and the death of Begin’s wife in November 1982, were probably among the factors that prompted him to resign from office in October 1983.
