Joseph Caillaux, in full Joseph-marie-auguste Caillaux,  (born March 30, 1863, Le Mans, France—died  Nov. 22, 1944, Mamers), French statesman who was an early supporter of a national income tax and whose opposition to World War I led to his imprisonment for treason in 1920.
The son of Eugène Caillaux, who was twice a conservative minister (1874–75 and 1877), he obtained his law degree in 1886 and then joined the Finance Ministry as a deputy inspector. After an initial failure he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies from the Sarthe département in 1898.
Having acquired a reputation as a fiscal expert, Caillaux twice served as minister of finance (1899–1902, 1906–09). Although he failed in his attempt to establish an income tax, he was successful with other important financial reforms.
After six weeks in the government of Ernest Monis, Caillaux was named premier (June 27, 1911). In an attempt to defuse a crisis over Morocco, he negotiated a settlement that gave France a protectorate over the North African territory in exchange for generous concessions to Germany in central Africa—a compromise that brought a massive public attack upon his patriotism. The hostility of a Senate investigating commission proved so embarrassing that he was forced to resign (January 1912). Gaston Calmette, editor of the influential Le Figaro, led a press campaign against him. When Calmette threatened to publish love letters between Caillaux and his mistress, who was now Madame Caillaux, she fatally shot him. The trial—in which she was acquitted—dominated French public life and even provoked clashes between leftist and right-wing street gangs.
With the outbreak of World War I, Caillaux, having moved to the left, spoke out in opposition to the war. This and his friendships with German agents led to formal charges of treason. On Dec. 22, 1917, his parliamentary immunity was removed, and on Jan. 4, 1918, he was imprisoned. After a long delay, he was brought to trial (February 1920) and found innocent of treason but guilty of committing “damage to the external security of the state.” His three-year prison sentence was commuted, but he was deprived of his civil rights for 10 years.
After an amnesty (July 14, 1924), however, he was called to head the Finance Ministry by Paul Painlevé (April 1925). In January 1927 Caillaux was elected to the Senate and, as head of the Commission of Finance, quickly became a dominant figure in the upper house. He did return briefly to the Finance Ministry (June 1–7, 1935), but by this time the Great Depression was severe, and he had moved back to the political centre.
Caillaux supported Édouard Daladier’s attempts to negotiate with Hitler in 1938–39, and, when France fell in 1940, he retired to his estate, where he resisted attempts by the Vichy regime to win his support.
