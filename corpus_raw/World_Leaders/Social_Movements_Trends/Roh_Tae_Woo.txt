Roh Tae-Woo,  (born December 4, 1932, near Taegu, Korea [now in South Korea]), Korean military officer and politician who, as president of South Korea (1988–93), instituted democratic reforms.
While a high-school student in Taegu, Roh became friends with a fellow student, Chun Doo-Hwan. Following the outbreak of the Korean War (1950–53), Roh joined the South Korean army and with Chun attended the Korean Military Academy, where they both graduated in 1955. Roh rose steadily through the ranks thereafter, becoming a general by 1979.
In October 1979 Pres. Park Chung-Hee was assassinated, and in December Chun and some fellow officers launched a coup against the civilian government; Roh, who was then an army division commander, gave them crucial support. Roh was a member of the Chun-led junta that ordered the brutal suppression of demonstrators in Kwangju (Gwangju) in May 1980. Chun became president in August of that year. Roh resigned from the military in 1981 and held a series of ministerial posts in Chun’s government, including minister of political affairs (1981), sports (1982), and home affairs (1982). As head of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee from 1983 to 1986, he oversaw South Korea’s preparations for the 1988 Summer Olympic Games held in Seoul.
In 1985 Chun chose Roh to become the new chairman of Chun’s ruling political party, the Democratic Justice Party (DJP), and in June 1987 Chun chose Roh to be the candidate of the DJP in the upcoming presidential elections. Under the country’s existing constitution, Roh was thus practically guaranteed to win the presidency, and this prospect ignited widespread popular unrest. In response, on June 29, 1987, Roh made a historic speech in which he proposed a broad program of democratic reforms, which led to the drafting of a new constitution (approved in October 1987). Chief among its provisions was the direct election of the president by popular vote.
In the December 1987 election, both major opposition candidates, Kim Young-Sam and Kim Dae-Jung, ran against Roh, splitting the opposition vote and thus enabling Roh’s victory. He began his five-year term as president on February 25, 1988.
As president, the moderate and conciliatory Roh committed himself to the democratization of South Korean politics. Partly as a result of Roh’s reforms, the DJP failed to gain a majority of seats in the National Assembly in elections in April 1988, but in 1990 the party, under Roh’s leadership, merged with two moderate opposition parties to form a new majority party called the Democratic Liberal Party. In foreign affairs, Roh’s government cultivated new ties with the Soviet Union (and later Russia) and China, obtained South Korea’s admission (1991) to the United Nations, and signed an agreement (1991) with North Korea calling for nonaggression between the two Koreas. In February 1993 he was succeeded by Kim Young-Sam, whose subsequent anticorruption reforms targeted Roh and Chun.
In October 1995 Roh publicly apologized for having illegally amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in secret political donations during his term as president. He subsequently was indicted and tried for corruption as well as for mutiny and sedition for his involvement in the 1979 coup (charges that had been leveled in 1994 but not pursued at that time). In August 1996 he was convicted on all counts; he was sentenced to 221/2 years in prison, which was later reduced to 17 years, and was fined about $300 million, a sum equivalent to the amount he was convicted of having taken illegally. Roh received a pardon in December 1997 from outgoing president Kim Young-Sam and President-elect Kim Dae-Jung.
