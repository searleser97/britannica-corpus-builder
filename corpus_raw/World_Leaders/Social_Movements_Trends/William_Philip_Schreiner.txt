William Philip Schreiner,  (born Aug. 30, 1857, Wittebergen, Cape Colony [now in South Africa]—died  June 28, 1919, Llandrindod Wells, Radnor, Wales), Southern African politician who was prime minister of Cape Colony at the outbreak of the South African War (1899–1902); he was the younger brother of author and political activist Olive Schreiner. A moderate politician, he tried to prevent the war and later was a champion of African civil rights.
Schreiner became a member of the Cape Colony Parliament in 1893 and was a minister in the government of Cecil Rhodes in 1893 and 1894–96. Elected prime minister in 1898 with the support of the Afrikaner Bond, he first sought a peaceful settlement of differences between the British and the Boers and then tried to keep Cape Colony neutral in the war that followed. His government fell in 1900. Although he was elected a delegate to the South African constitutional convention in 1909, Schreiner did not attend, choosing rather to defend in court an African chief unjustly accused of rebellion. He opposed the draft constitution because it did not guarantee the franchise to Africans. Subsequently he was appointed to the Senate of the newly formed Union of South Africa as a representative of nonwhites. In 1914 he left the Senate to serve as the union’s high commissioner in London.
