Ebenezer R. Hoar, in full Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar,  (born Feb. 21, 1816, Concord, Mass., U.S.—died  Jan. 31, 1895, Concord), American politician, a leading antislavery Whig in Massachusetts who was briefly attorney general in President Ulysses S. Grant’s administration.
Born into a distinguished New England family, Hoar graduated from Harvard College (1835) and Harvard Law School (1839). His entry into private legal practice was followed by a rapid rise to prominence, and his outspoken opposition to slavery made him a leading public figure in his home state.
By the mid-1840s, Hoar was an antislavery Whig member of the state senate. It was there that he described himself as a “Conscience Whig,” in contrast to the proslavery “Cotton Whigs.” These designations were henceforth widely used, and Hoar became a recognized spokesman of the Conscience Whigs. As such, he opposed the Whigs’ nomination of Zachary Taylor for president in 1848, and he was instrumental in the formation of the Free Soil and Republican parties in Massachusetts when the Whig Party declined.
Made a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1849, Hoar remained at that post until returning to private legal practice in 1855. In 1859 he became an associate justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, a position that he held until 1869, when President Grant appointed him U.S. attorney general. His tenure was brief, however. He alienated the Senate when he insisted that nine newly created federal judgeships be filled according to merit rather than through patronage. As a consequence, the Senate refused to confirm Hoar when Grant nominated him for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1870 Hoar resigned from Grant’s cabinet.
After serving one term in the House of Representatives (1873–75), Hoar was defeated in his try for a Senate seat in 1876. Thereafter, he refused to run again for public office. He did, however, remain active in the Republican Party and was a delegate to several Republican national conventions.
