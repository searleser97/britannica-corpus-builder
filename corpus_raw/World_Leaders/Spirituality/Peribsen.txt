Peribsen,  Egyptian king of the 2nd dynasty (c. 2775–c. 2650 bce) who apparently promoted the cult of the god Seth over that of Horus, the god favoured by his predecessors. His tomb is located in the early dynastic royal cemetery at Abydos, in Upper Egypt. According to some scholars, Peribsen’s ascendancy was accompanied by a violent reaction against the supporters of Horus, but the supremacy of Horus was restored after his death.
