Amasis Painter,  (flourished c. 560–515 bc), ancient Greek vase painter who, with Exekias, was among the most accomplished of Archaic vase painters. He was responsible for the decoration of several of the black-figure amphorae (two-handled jars), cenochoae (wine pitchers), and lekythoi (oil flasks) of the Amasis Potter.
Paintings by the Amasis Painter have been recognized on eight vessels signed by the potter Amasis, but more than 130 painted vases have been attributed to him. Among those thought to have been decorated by him are a Dionysus and the Maenads now in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris; an “Apollo and Heracles” in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts; and a wedding procession in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. He preferred small figures and full compositions but never produced confusing or ill-organized scenes.
