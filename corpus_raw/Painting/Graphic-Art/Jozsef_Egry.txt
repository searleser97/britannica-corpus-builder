József Egry, Hungarian form Egry József,  (born March 15, 1883, Zalaújlak, Hung.—died June 19, 1951, Badacsonytomaj), Hungarian painter and graphic artist. Egry primarily painted landscapes, and his style emphasized a close study and rendering of the effects of light.
Egry studied painting in Munich (1904) and Paris (1906) and then at the Mintarajziskola (School of Drawing) in Budapest from 1906 to 1908. In 1912 he traveled to Belgium, where he became acquainted with and adopted the disciplined approach of Jean-François Millet and Constantin Meunier. After returning to Hungary, he settled in a hillside village on Lake Balaton that became his permanent home and the inspiration for much of his work. He avoided the Impressionist influences fashionable in his day and chose instead to associate himself with Expressionism. Using a mixture of oil, pastel, and watercolour paints, he created such accomplished works as Delelés (1926; “High Noon”), Szent Kristóf a Balatonnál (1927; “Saint Christopher at the Balaton”), Szigligeti kúpok (1936; “The Domes of Szigliget”), and Delelő fényben (1940; “In the Midday Sunshine”).
