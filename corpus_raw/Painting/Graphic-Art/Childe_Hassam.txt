Childe Hassam, in full Frederick Childe Hassam,   (born Oct. 17, 1859, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died Aug. 27, 1935, East Hampton, N.Y.), painter and printmaker, one of the foremost exponents of French Impressionism in American art.
Hassam studied in Boston and Paris (1886–89), where he fell under the influence of the Impressionists and took to painting in brilliant colour with touches of pure pigment. On his return from Paris he settled in New York City, where he became a member of the group known as The Ten.
His works are distinctive for their freshness and clear luminous atmosphere. Scenes of New York life remained his favourite subject matter—e.g., Washington Arch, Spring (1890). He also painted landscapes of New England and rural New York that, with their intense blue skies, lush foliage, and shimmering white light, became especially popular.
Hassam produced about 300 black-and-white etchings and lithographs that are notable for their sense of light and atmosphere.
