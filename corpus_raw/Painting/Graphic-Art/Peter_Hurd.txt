Peter Hurd,  (born Feb. 22, 1904, Roswell, New Mexico Territory, U.S.—died  July 9, 1984, Roswell, N.M.), U.S. painter, printmaker, and illustrator in the regional realist tradition.
Hurd attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., resigning after two years to pursue a career in painting. During a term at Haverford College in Pennsylvania he made the acquaintance of the renowned illustrator N.C. Wyeth, who lived in the area, and subsequently apprenticed in his studio. At Wyeth’s urging he entered the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1924. In 1929 Hurd married Wyeth’s eldest daughter, Henriette, herself a painter.
The influence of his mentor’s heightened realistic style was strong in Hurd’s illustrations for children’s books in the late 1920s. During the early ’30s he began experimenting with egg tempera and in 1933 received the commission for a mural triptych at the New Mexico Military Institute at Roswell, which he executed in the newfound medium. Hurd found the vivid New Mexico light and landscape of his childhood profoundly conducive to his art and resettled there with his family in the ’30s. During 1942 and 1944 he travelled abroad as a war correspondent for Life magazine. In 1967 Hurd’s official portrait of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson was rejected by Johnson; the painting was purchased by the Smithsonian Institution. In his later paintings, Hurd continued to work in watercolours, egg tempera, and lithographs and remained a steadfast realist, perfecting an anonymous, dry, luministic technique for evoking the arid expanse of his native territory.
