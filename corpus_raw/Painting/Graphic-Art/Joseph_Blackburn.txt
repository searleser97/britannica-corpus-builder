Joseph Blackburn, also called Jonathan B. Blackburn,  (born c. 1730, England—died c. 1778), itinerant portrait painter who, working in Bermuda (c. 1752–53) and later in New England (c. 1753–64), introduced the decorative tradition of English Rococo portraiture to the American colonies. Blackburn’s English connections and sophisticated painting style caused many wealthy American colonists to seek his services.
In an occasional portrait, such as that of Theodore Atkinson, Blackburn achieved some degree of individuality in the features; but most of his works, particularly his likenesses of women, emphasize pose and costume at the expense of characterization. Blackburn frequently repeated a composition, even the details of clothing and jewelry. His posing of his subjects and compositional arrangements briefly exerted an influence on the youthful John Singleton Copley. About 1764 Blackburn returned to England. His career after that is obscure, but there is a record of a payment made in 1774 for two portraits he painted in England.
