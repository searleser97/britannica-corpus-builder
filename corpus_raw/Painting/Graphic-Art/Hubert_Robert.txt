Hubert Robert,  (born May 22, 1733, Paris, France—died  April 15, 1808, Paris), French landscape painter sometimes called Robert des Ruines because of his many romantic representations of Roman ruins set in idealized surroundings.
Robert left Paris for Rome in 1754 and studied at the French Academy there. He also met the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard in Rome, and in 1760 they traveled together with the Abbé de Saint-Non through southern Italy on a drawing expedition. Robert developed a strong fascination with architecture and ruins, and he was strongly influenced by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, the renowned etcher of architectural subjects who was then publishing his great collections of etchings of Roman architecture. Among Robert’s best-known works from his Roman period is a series of red chalk drawings of the gardens at the Villa d’Este, that feature the garden’s dilapidated Classical-style architecture set in an overgrown landscape and animated with small human figures.
Returning to Paris in 1765, Robert became a member of the French Royal Academy in 1766. A gifted decorative artist, he based his paintings on his Italian drawings, and his popularity was enhanced by exhibitions at the Salons from 1767 onward. In addition to Italian landscapes, he painted scenes of Ermenonville, Marly, and Versailles, near Paris, and of the south of France, with its ruined Roman monuments. In 1778 he was appointed dessinateur des jardins du roi (“designer of the king’s gardens”) and designed a new grotto for the gardens at Versailles as well as an English-style garden at the château of Rambouillet for Louis XVI. In the 1780s and ’90s he painted a series of oil sketches of the Grande Galerie of the Louvre as part of a proposed replanning. He also continued to paint Italian landscapes. He was imprisoned during the latter part of the French Revolution (1793–94), but he carried on his work during his incarceration.
