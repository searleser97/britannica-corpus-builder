Shingei, , also called Geiami,  (died 1485, Japan), Japanese artist who represents the second generation of an extraordinary family of painters and art connoisseurs and who served the Ashikaga shoguns (a family of military dictators that ruled Japan, 1338–1573).
Shingei succeeded his father, Shinnō (Nōami), as curator of the Ashikaga art collection, but as an artist he followed Tenshō Shūbun (early to mid-15th century), the foremost suiboku (monochromatic ink painting) painter who, in turn, had been inspired by the Chinese landscape masters Hsia Kuei and Ma Yüan (active 12th century ad). Shingei’s most famous painting, “The Waterfall” (1480; in the Nezu Art Museum in Tokyo), is executed in the Tenshō Shūbun manner; but its pronounced stylization represents a significantly greater departure from the original Chinese landscape paintings. Shingei’s style was continued by his disciple Kei Shoki, for whom “The Waterfall” was painted as a parting gift.
