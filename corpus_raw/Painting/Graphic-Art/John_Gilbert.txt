Sir John Gilbert,  (born July 21, 1817, London—died  Oct. 5, 1897, London), English Romantic painter and illustrator of literary classics, especially remembered for his woodcut illustrations for the works of Shakespeare (1858–60) and Scott. He preferred medieval chivalric subjects, and such pictures as Sir Lancelot du Lake (1887) earned him the epithet “the Scott of painting.”
A prolific watercolourist, Gilbert was associated with the Old Water-Colour Society from 1852 and became its president in 1871, shortly after which he was knighted. He was made a member of the Royal Academy in 1876. His imaginative drawings, notable for their breadth of scale and dramatic chiaroscuro, enhanced the popularity of The Illustrated London News.
