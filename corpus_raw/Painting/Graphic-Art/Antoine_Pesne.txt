Antoine Pesne,  (born May 23, 1683, Paris, France—died August 5, 1757, Berlin, Prussia [Germany]), French-born Rococo painter of historical subjects and portraits who was the most important artist in Prussia in the first half of the 18th century.
His father, the painter Thomas Pesne, and his maternal great-uncle, Charles de La Fosse, were probably his first teachers. While studying in Paris, he was influenced by the leading French portraitists, Hyacinthe Rigaud and Nicolas de Largillière. In Rome and Naples and particularly in Venice, where he studied with Andrea Celesti, Pesne developed a marked talent as a colourist.
In 1707 Pesne’s full-length portrait of the Prussian ambassador to Venice, baron von Knyphausen, attracted the attention of Frederick I of Prussia, who appointed him court portraitist. When Frederick II came of age, Pesne was able to give full scope to his colouristic gifts in mythological and allegorical ceiling paintings and murals, executed for the interiors of the palaces of Rheinsberg, Charlottenburg, Berlin, Potsdam, and Sanssouci. He continued to paint portraits, some of which achieve by their brushwork and brilliant colouring an almost impressionistic effect anticipating Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Of special interest are the various representations, in the style of Antoine Watteau, of Italian and French dancers and actresses whom Frederick II engaged for the Berlin Opera. These portraits are often cited for their perceptive characterizations.
