Milton Avery, in full Milton Clark Avery,  (born March 7, 1893, Altmar, New York, U.S.â€”died January 3, 1965, New York City), painter noted in his later years for depicting the human figure as a contoured flat pattern in vivid colours. In 1905 his family moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where he studied briefly (1913) at the League of Art Students, but he was largely self-taught. He presented his first one-man show in New York City in 1928.
Avery painted many landscapes, particularly seashores; his daughter, March, was a frequent subject. His treatment of these themes is reminiscent of the French painter Henri Matisse in the use of colour, elimination of detail, and depiction of the figure and landscape as interwoven flat shapes.
