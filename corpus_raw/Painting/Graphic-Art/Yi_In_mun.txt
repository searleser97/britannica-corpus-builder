Yi In-mun, also called Yu-ch’un (Korean: “Exist Spring”),  (born 1745, Haejo, Korea—died  1821, Seoul), famous Korean landscape painter.
A follower of the traditional Northern school of Chinese painting, Yi was known for the subtlety of his designs and the confidence of his brushstrokes. His most famous work, “River in Spring,” is a long horizontal scroll depicting an endless landscape along a river. His use of watercolour, unusual in landscape painting before that time, started a new trend in Korean art.
