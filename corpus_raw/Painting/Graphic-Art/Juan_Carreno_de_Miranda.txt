Juan Carreño de Miranda,  (born March 25, 1614, Avilés, Asturias, Spain—died  Oct. 3, 1685, Madrid), painter, considered the most important Spanish court painter of the Baroque period after Diego Velázquez. Influenced and overshadowed both by Velázquez and Sir Anthony Van Dyck, he was nonetheless a highly original and sensitive artist in his own right.
Carreño studied painting under Pedro de las Cavas and Bartolomé Román. He assisted Velázquez in the decoration of the Alcázar in Madrid and the other royal palaces and was appointed painter to King Charles II in 1669 and court painter in 1671.
Although he is known primarily as a portraitist, he also painted many religious works in oil and fresco that reveal a unique Baroque sensibility. Such works as his masterpiece, Founding of the Trinitarian Order (1666), are marked by mastery of execution, subtle interplay of light and shadow, and inventiveness of scene. Following the tradition of Velázquez’ court portraits, he painted many pictures of the queen mother, Mariana of Austria, and traced in oil the decline of Charles II from a handsome child to a decrepit old man. Even the most repellent portraits of Charles possess the aristocratic elegance that characterize Carreño’s paintings.
