Charles Burchfield, in full Charles Ephraim Burchfield,  (born April 9, 1893, Ashtabula Harbor, Ohio, U.S.—died January 10, 1967, Gardenville, New York), American painter known initially for his realistic watercolours of the American scene and later for his mystically poetic landscapes.
From 1912 to 1916 Burchfield attended the Cleveland School of Art. He returned to his home in Salem, Ohio, where he had an industrial job and in his spare time painted imaginative watercolours of nature. After military service in World War I, he worked as a wallpaper designer in Buffalo until 1929, when, having received critical acclaim and gallery representation, he was able to devote his time to art.
During the 1920s and ’30s Burchfield’s work was closely associated with that of the painter Edward Hopper because of its emphasis on the loneliness and harshness of American cities and small towns. In November Evening (1931–34), for example, weather-beaten buildings convey a mood of stark realism.
After 1940 Burchfield’s style changed, however, and by the mid-1940s he had abandoned realism, returning to his early interest in personal interpretations of nature. His paintings from this period convey a sense of wonder at the colour, movement, and forms of nature, particularly in connection with the seasons. A notable example of his later style is The Sphinx and the Milky Way (1946).
