Albert Bierstadt,  (born Jan. 7, 1830, near Düsseldorf, Westphalia [Germany]—died  Feb. 19, 1902, New York, N.Y., U.S.), American artist who painted landscapes and whose tremendous popularity was based on his panoramic scenes of the American West. Among the last generation of painters associated with the Hudson River school, Bierstadt, like Frederick Church and Thomas Moran, covered vast distances in search of more exotic subject matter. His reputation was made by the huge canvases that resulted from his several trips to the Far West—e.g., The Rocky Mountains (1863; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City) and Mount Corcoran (c. 1875–77; Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). Executed in his studio in New York, the large works do not have the freshness and spontaneity of the small on-the-spot paintings from which they were produced. They are, however, immense in scale and grandiose in effect. Bierstadt freely altered details of landscape to create the effect of awe and grandeur. His colours were applied more according to a formula than from observation: luscious, green vegetation, ice-blue water, and pale, atmospheric blue-green mountains. The progression from foreground to background was often a dramatic one without the softness and subtlety of a middle distance.
