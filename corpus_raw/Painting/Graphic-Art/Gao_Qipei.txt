Gao Qipei, Wade-Giles romanization Kao Ch’i-p’ei,  (born 1660, Tieling, Liaoning province, China—died 1734), technically innovative Chinese landscape painter who used his hands—palms, fingers, nails—in place of the traditional Chinese brush. Gao was precocious and gifted and served in an official capacity during the Qing period. His larger paintings for the Manchu court were somewhat more orthodox, but he painted smaller works with great speed and facility, revealing in them his rather conscious attempts at originality.
