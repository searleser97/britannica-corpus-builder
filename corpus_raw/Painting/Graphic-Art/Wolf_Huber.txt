Wolf Huber,  (born c. 1485, Feldkirch?, Tirol [Austria]—died  1553, Passau, Bishopric of Passau [Germany]), Austrian painter, draftsman, and printmaker who was one of the principal artists associated with the Danube school of landscape painting.
After 1509 Huber’s career was centred in Passau, Ger., where he was court painter to the prince-bishop. Among his important paintings was the altarpiece of St. Anne for the Church of St. Nikolaus in his native Feldkirch in Vorarlberg, Austria (1515–21). Some of Huber’s most expressive and poetic works are his landscapes, especially drawings he made of the Danube River valley on a trip (c. 1529) from Passau to Vienna.
