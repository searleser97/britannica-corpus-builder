Hŏ Ryŏn, also called Soch’i (Korean: “Little Fool”),  (born 1809, Korea—died  1892, Korea), well-known Korean painter and calligrapher. Immensely popular in his time, Hŏ resisted the nationalizing tendency in Korean art, returning instead to the traditional Chinese academic style. His paintings of flowers and trees have special force and rhythm but are unrelated to their Korean subjects. His calligraphy, however, faithfully follows the native Korean ch’usa style (see Korean calligraphy).
