Adriaen Brouwer, Brouwer also spelled Brauwer,  (born 1605/06, Oudenaarde, Flanders [now in Belgium]—buried February 1, 1638, Antwerp), Flemish genre painter and draughtsman who influenced artists in both Flanders and Holland.
According to his biographer Arnold Houbraken, Brouwer went to study under Frans Hals in Haarlem about 1621 (he shares nothing of Hals’s style, however, and others have suggested that he studied with his own father), gained a high reputation in Holland, and returned to the South Netherlands in 1631. There he was arrested and imprisoned by the Spaniards as a spy until September 1633. He then settled in Antwerp. Except for a handful of landscapes, apparently from his last years, all of Brouwer’s pictures are of subjects drawn from common life—showing peasants smoking, drinking, or brawling in taverns; quack surgeons operating on grimacing patients; and so on. Most of the pictures are small and painted on panel. The coarseness of his subjects contrasts with the delicacy of his style, which in its mature stage shows an unusual mastery of tonal values.
