Louis-Léopold Boilly,  (born July 5, 1761, La Bassée, France—died January 4, 1845, Paris), prolific painter known for his genre scenes of Parisian life and society during the Revolution and the French Empire. He is also noted for his pioneering use of lithography.
Boilly, the son of a wood-carver, painted portraits for a living before moving to Paris in 1785. There he began to paint the detailed anecdotal pictures of fashionable scenes that were to make him famous. He began exhibiting at the Salon in 1791 and gained the favour of the new republican regime with his painting The Triumph of Marat (1794), a flattering view of the revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat. Over the next 40 years, Boilly painted a large number of works depicting the most varied aspects of everyday life in Paris. Such paintings as Gathering of Artists in the Studio of Isabey (1798), The Arrival of the Stagecoach (1803), The Studio of Houdon (1804), and Departure of the Conscripts (1808) show his considerable skill at handling crowd scenes. In 1823 Boilly produced his first lithographs, a humorous series entitled Grimaces. In 1833 he received the Legion of Honour. Altogether he executed about 500 genre paintings and some 5,000 small portraits.
