Shōkadō Shōjō, , original name Nakanuma Shikibu,  (born 1584, Yamato Province, Japan—died  Nov. 3, 1639, Japan), Japanese calligrapher and painter, one of the “three brushes” of the Kan-ei era.
He was a priest and respected theologian of the Shingon sect of Buddhism, who declined high office and retired to the Takinomoto-bō, a small temple on the slope of Otoko-yama (Mt. Otoko) south of Kyōto, to devote himself to calligraphy, painting, poetry, and the tea ceremony. In 1637 he moved to another small mountain retreat, the Shōkadō (Pine Flower Temple), whence his name and the name of his school of followers, the Shōkadō school. His major achievement was to revivify calligraphy by reviving the traditional sō (“grass”) writing style—a rapid, cursive script that originated in China and was practiced by a 9th-century Japanese Shingon saint Kōbō Daishi. Using the sō script, Shōkadō inscribed 16 love poems on a six-panelled folding screen covered with gold leaf (Kimiko and John Powers Collection, U.S.). As a painter, he worked in both the Yamato-e (Japanese painting) style and in monochromatic ink after the manner of the 13th-century Chinese monk-artists Mu-ch’i Fa-ch’ang and Yin-t’o-lo.
