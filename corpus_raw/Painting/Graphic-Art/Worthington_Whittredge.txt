Worthington Whittredge, in full Thomas Worthington Whittredge,  (born May 22, 1820, Springfield, Ohio, U.S.—died February 25, 1910, Summit, New Jersey), American landscape painter associated with the Hudson River school.
Whittredge, originally a house painter, took up portraiture and landscape painting about 1838. Beginning in 1849 he spent five years in Düsseldorf, Germany, and five years in Rome, where he posed for Emanuel Leutze, who used him as the model for George Washington in Washington Crossing the Delaware (1851). In 1856 he spent time sketching in Switzerland with the painter Albert Bierstadt.
On his return to the United States in 1859, Whittredge became inspired by the varied and rich American landscape. He settled in New York City, renting a space in the famous Tenth Street Studio, and gained almost immediate recognition. In 1860 he was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design, becoming a full member two years later. In 1866 he went on a 2,000-mile government inspection tour of the Rocky Mountains with the landscape painters John Frederick Kensett and Sanford R. Gifford. His experiences on this journey inspired huge canvases of vast, panoramic views such as Crossing the Platte (1870). His most characteristic works are poetic forest scenes featuring depths of feathery fern and mossy rocks, infused with leaf-filtered light, e.g., Forest Interior (1881). Whittredge did not paint landscapes for nature’s sake alone but rather chose places he loved, giving his works a personal sensibility. By the late 1870s, Whittredge’s style changed under the influence of the then popular Hudson River school painters.  He continued painting until age 83, experimenting with various styles as new fashions took hold of the New York art world. His autobiography (The Autobiography of Worthington Whittredge, 1820–1910) was first published in the Brooklyn Museum’s journal and was reissued in 1969.
