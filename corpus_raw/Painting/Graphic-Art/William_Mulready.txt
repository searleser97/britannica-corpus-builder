William Mulready,  (born April 1, 1786, Ennis, County Clare, Ireland—died July 7, 1863, London, England), genre painter best known for his scenes of rural life and anecdotal genre.
Mulready entered the Royal Academy schools in London in 1800. In 1808 he began to gain a reputation for his still-life and “cottage” subjects, and in 1816 he was made a member of the Royal Academy. Meanwhile, in 1805, the works of David Wilkie had started a trend toward entertaining and highly animated narrative pictures that had strong links to naturalistic and sentimental literature. This vogue, backed by the prince of Wales’s taste for the paintings of the Dutch masters, inspired a reaction against the grand manner advocated by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Mulready was quick to capitalize on this trend. At first, like his Dutch exemplars, he painted opaquely and directly, mainly in earth tones, but later, and especially after 1830, he turned to rich glazes.
Mulready is also noted for his academic studies, his illustrations for books—both for children and for adults—and his design (1840) for the first penny postage envelope, presenting Britannia sending celestial messengers to the farthest outskirts of the Empire. Mulready’s design, however, was widely caricatured in the popular press.
