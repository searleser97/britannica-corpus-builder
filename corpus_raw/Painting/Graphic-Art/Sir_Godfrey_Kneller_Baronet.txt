Sir Godfrey Kneller, Baronet, original name Gottfried Kniller,  (born August 8, 1646, Lübeck, Germany—died October 19, 1723, London, England), painter who became the leading Baroque portraitist in England during the late 17th and early 18th centuries.
Kneller studied in Amsterdam under Ferdinand Bol, one of Rembrandt’s pupils, before going to Italy in 1672. His Elijah of that year gives evidence of a style close to Bol’s. In Italy he began to paint portraits and modified his style. Arriving in England in 1674 or 1675, he soon established himself as a portrait painter, especially after he painted Charles II, and he succeeded the leading portraitist of the Restoration period, Sir Peter Lely, as principal painter to the king. Kneller was knighted in 1691 and made a baronet in 1715. (Though married, he died without legitimate issue, and the baronetcy became extinct upon his death.)
Kneller’s style was broad and facile, but his characterizations could be penetrating. Among his best works are 42 portraits of members of the famous political and literary association called the Kit-Cat Club, which are now in the National Portrait Gallery, London. These were painted between about 1700 and about 1720 and are of a size (36 × 28 inches; 91 × 71 cm) that allows a half-length portrait showing one or both hands; “kitcat size” is now a generic term. He also executed a portrait series titled The Hampton Court Beauties and did portraits of British admirals. Studio assistants painted the draperies and other subsidiary elements in many of Kneller’s portraits. Before Kneller, foreign-born artists dominated English painting; after him, native English painters came to the fore and remained there. Kneller is the only painter to be commemorated at Westminster Abbey, with a large marble memorial by sculptor John M. Rysbrack.
