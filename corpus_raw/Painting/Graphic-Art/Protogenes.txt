Protogenes,   (flourished  4th century bc, ; b. Caunus, Caria [now in Turkey]), Greek painter, contemporary and rival of Apelles, noted for the care and time he devoted to each of his paintings. He lived most of his life at Rhodes. Little else is known of him, and none of his paintings survives. The “Ialysus” and the “Resting Satyr” were among the most renowned of his works.
The “Ialysus” was a painting of the hero-guardian of a Rhodian town of the same name. According to ancient accounts, Protogenes spent from 7 to 10 years on this painting. After remaining in Rhodes for at least 200 years, the “Ialysus” was carried off to Rome. There it was placed in the Temple of Peace, where later it was destroyed by fire.
Protogenes worked on the painting of the “Resting Satyr” in his Rhodian garden during the siege of the city by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 305–304 bc. According to legend, Demetrius was so moved by the artist’s dedication that he took special precautions to protect him and his work. Protogenes has also been mentioned for his portraits and as the author of two books on painting.
