Corneille de Lyon,  (born c. 1500, The Hague—died  1574?), highly reputed portrait painter of 16th-century France, few of whose works have survived.
Early in his life Corneille went to France, where in 1524 he became attached to the royal court in Lyon. In 1541 he was appointed official painter of the Dauphin (the future king Henry II). When Henry II ascended the throne in 1547, Corneille became his painter and chief valet. He became a naturalized French citizen. The artist’s major work of this period was a series of portraits of the French court. In 1564 Catherine de Médicis visited the artist and was struck by the lifelike quality of her own portrait. In that same year Corneille received a gift of money from Charles IX, whom he served as royal painter. One of the last known facts about him is his rejection of Protestantism to become a Roman Catholic in 1569. After 1574 there is no record of him.
Very few existing works bear the de Lyon signature. A series of royal portraits in the Louvre are uncertainly attributed to him.
