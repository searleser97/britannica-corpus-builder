Kawanabe Kyōsai, Kyōsai also spelled Gyōsai, also called Shōjō Kyōsai,  (born May 18, 1831, Koga, Japan—died April 25, 1889, Tokyo), Japanese painter and caricaturist.
After working briefly with Utagawa Kuniyoshi, the last great master of the Japanese colour print, Kyōsai received most of his artistic training in the studio of Kanō Tōhaku. He soon abandoned the formal traditions of this master for the greater freedom of the popular school. The great painter Hokusai influenced his work, and, like that artist, Kyōsai delighted in sketching figures, conveying in a few masterly strokes an impression of living energy and momentary action.
During and after the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Kyōsai attained a considerable reputation as a caricaturist. Though often imprisoned, he continued to express his opinions in caricature with great popular success. His sketchbooks and a five-volume work on hawks were also published. Originality and humour are obvious in his sketches of goblins and animal life, especially birds, fish, and reptiles.
Kyōsai was fond of sake and is said to have done his best work under its influence. Many of his books, prints, and sketches are signed Shōjō (“Drunken”) Kyōsai.
