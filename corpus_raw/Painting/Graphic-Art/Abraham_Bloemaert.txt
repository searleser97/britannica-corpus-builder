Abraham Bloemaert,  (born Dec. 25, 1564, Gorinchem [now in the Netherlands]—died Jan. 27, 1651, Utrecht, Neth.), influential Dutch Mannerist painter and engraver.
Bloemaert studied at Utrecht under eminent painters, spent three years in Paris, and then returned to settle finally at Utrecht, where he became dean of the Guild of St. Luke. He painted and etched historical and allegorical pictures, landscapes, still lifes, animal pictures, and flower pieces. His four sons—Hendrick, Frederick, Cornelis, and Adriaen—all achieved considerable reputations themselves as painters and engravers. Bloemaert’s work was influenced by Caravaggio, and he in his turn was an influence on Jan Both, Aelbert Jacobszoon Cuyp, Gerrit van Honthorst, Hendrik Terbrugghen, and Jan Baptist Weenix.
