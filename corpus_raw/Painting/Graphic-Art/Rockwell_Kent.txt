Rockwell Kent,  (born June 21, 1882, Tarrytown Heights, New York, U.S.—died March 13, 1971, Plattsburgh, New York), painter and illustrator whose works, though never radically innovative, represented scenes of nature and adventure with such vividness and drama that he became one of the most popular American artists of the first half of the 20th century.
Kent studied architecture at Columbia University but turned to painting and was a pupil of William M. Chase, Robert Henri, and Abbott Thayer. His early works, mostly moody landscapes and seascapes, are highly stylized with dramatic tonal contrasts, as seen in The Road Roller. In the course of a varied career he worked as an architectural draftsman, as a lobsterman and carpenter on the coast of Maine, and as a ship’s carpenter. He explored the waters about Tierra del Fuego in a small boat and lived in Newfoundland, Alaska, and Greenland, drawing heavily upon these experiences for his paintings and travel books.
Kent illustrated books for a number of contemporary writers, as well as an autobiography, It’s Me, O Lord (1955), and works by Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Melville. In 1966 he was elected to the Academy of Arts of the U.S.S.R.
