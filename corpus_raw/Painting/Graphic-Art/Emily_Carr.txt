Emily Carr,  (born Dec. 13, 1871, Victoria, B.C., Can.â€”died  March 2, 1945, Victoria), painter and writer, regarded as a major Canadian artist for her paintings of western coast Indians and landscape.
While teaching art in Vancouver, B.C., Carr made frequent sketching trips to British Columbian Indian villages. Her work had little financial success and was interrupted for long periods by her attempts to earn a living. After ill health ended her painting trips, she turned to writing, producing six autobiographical books that were enlivened by satiric character studies. Among them are Klee Wyck (1941), dealing with the Indians; The House of All Sorts (1944), describing her experiences as a boardinghouse owner and dog breeder in Victoria; Growing Pains (1946), an autobiography; and Pause: A Sketch Book (1953), telling of her stay in an English sanatorium.
