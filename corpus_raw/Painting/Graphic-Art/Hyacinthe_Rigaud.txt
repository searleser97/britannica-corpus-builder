Hyacinthe Rigaud, original name Hyacinthe François Honoré Mathias Pierre André Jean Rigau y Ros,  (baptized July 18, 1659, Perpignan, Fr.—died Dec. 29, 1743, Paris), one of the most prolific and successful French portrait painters of the Baroque period. He was trained at Montpellier before moving to Lyon and finally to Paris in 1681, where he devoted himself to portraiture. By 1688, when he received his first royal commission, he already had a considerable reputation among the wealthier bourgeoisie of Paris. From 1690 onward, his work, primarily for the court, consisted almost entirely of portraits. A private ambition was realized when he gained admission to the academy as a historical painter in January 1700.
He excelled in the great formal portrait, as in his famous painting of Louis XIV in robes of state (1701; now in the Louvre).
