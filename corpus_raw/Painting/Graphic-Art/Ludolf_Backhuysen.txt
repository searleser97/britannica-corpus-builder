Ludolf Backhuysen, Backhuysen also spelled Bakhuysen or Bakhuizen,  (born December 28, 1630, Emden, East Frisia [Germany]â€”buried  November 12, 1708, Amsterdam, Netherlands), Dutch painter, celebrated for his sea pieces.
Backhuysen studied under the Dutch painters Allart van Everdingen and Hendrik Dubbels. His numerous compositions are nearly all variations of marine themes, in a style peculiarly his own, marked by intense realism. In his later years Backhuysen employed his time in etching and calligraphy.
