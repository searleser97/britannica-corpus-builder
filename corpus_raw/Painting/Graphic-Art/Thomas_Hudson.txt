Thomas Hudson,  (born 1701, Devon, Eng.—died  Jan. 26, 1779, Twickenham, Middlesex, Eng.), English portrait painter, who forms an important link in the apostolic succession of English portrait painters and was praised by contemporaries for his ability to catch a likeness.
Hudson was a pupil of Jonathan Richardson, whose daughter he married, and the young Joshua Reynolds was bound apprentice to him in October 1740. Hudson began to receive notice in the early 1730s, and by 1742 he was one of the most successful of the portrait painters working in London; he painted members of the royal family and “abundance of Persons of Quality.” A large number of his portraits were engraved. He probably retired from active practice before 1760.
