Anton Mauve,  (born September 18, 1838, Zaandam, Netherlands—died February 5, 1888, Arnhem), Dutch Romantic painter who, like his friends Jozef Israëls and the three Maris brothers, was profoundly influenced by the French landscape painter Camille Corot and the Barbizon school.
Mauve settled at The Hague about 1870, painting in the neighbouring fishing village of Scheveningen. There he became part of a group of artists known as the Hague school, whose members specialized in representing landscapes and scenes of rural life in the Netherlands. In 1885 he went to live in the country at Laren, near Hilversum, where he brought together a group of landscape painters who came to be known as the “Dutch Barbizon.” Mauve’s pictures are subdued in colour and similar to those of Corot in their harmonies of grays and blues. His major pictures include Cows in Meadow and Dune Landscape. He was an accomplished watercolourist. His wife was a cousin of Vincent van Gogh, to whom Mauve gave advice about oil painting in 1881 and 1882.
