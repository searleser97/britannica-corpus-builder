Laura Wheeler Waring, original name Laura Wheeler,  (born May 16, 1887, Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.—died February 3, 1948, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), American painter and educator who often depicted African American subjects.
The daughter of upper-class parents, Laura Wheeler graduated from Hartford (Connecticut) High School (with honours) during a time when few African American women attended school. In 1908 she entered the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. After graduating from the academy, Wheeler founded and taught in the art and music departments at the State Normal School at Cheyney (later Cheyney University) outside of Philadelphia, where she remained for more than 30 years. She married Walter Waring, a professor at Lincoln University in Philadelphia, in the late 1920s.
While supporting herself as a teacher, she also painted. Waring received acclaim as a portrait artist but created landscapes and still lifes as well. Between 1927 and 1931 Waring’s work was displayed at several institutions, including the Smithsonian Institution and the Art Institute of Chicago. Her illustrations depicting African American subjects appeared in several books and magazines. In 1943 the Harmon Foundation, a New York City organization developed to recognize the achievements of African Americans, commissioned Waring to paint the series Portraits of Outstanding American Citizens of Negro Origin. Among her well-known portrait subjects for this project were W.E.B. DuBois, George Washington Carver, Marian Anderson, and James Weldon Johnson. One year after her death, the Howard University Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., held an exhibit of her work.
