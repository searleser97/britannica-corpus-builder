William Bradford,  (born April 30, 1823, Fairhaven, Mass., U.S.—died  April 25, 1892, New York City), U.S. marine painter whose pictures attracted much attention by reason of their novelty and colour effects.
He was a Quaker and a self-taught artist, painting the ships and the marine views he saw along the coasts of Massachusetts, Labrador, and Nova Scotia; he went on several Arctic expeditions with Isaac Hayes and was the first American painter to portray the frozen regions of the north. His “Steamer ‘Panther’ in Melville Bay, under the Light of the Midnight Sun” was exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1875. Bradford was a member of the National Academy of Design, New York City.
His style was somewhat influenced by Albert van Beest, who worked with him at Fairhaven for a time, but Bradford is observant of minute detail, whereas Beest’s aim was general effect. John Greenleaf Whittier’s poem “Amy Wentworth” was inspired by a Bradford painting and is addressed to him.
