Richard Parkes Bonington,  (born October 25, 1802, Arnold, near Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England—died September 23, 1828, London), English Romantic painter known for his landscapes and historical scenes. His style attracted many imitators in both England and France, and he exercised an influence out of all proportion to his brief life.
At Calais, France (c. 1817), Bonington learned the watercolour tradition of the English painter Thomas Girtin. He became acquainted with the French painter Eugène Delacroix in Paris. Bonington entered the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris (1819), and joined the atelier of Baron Gros, who had departed from the rigid classicism of the influential Jacques-Louis David. Bonington’s bright watercolours, a novelty in Paris, financed sketching tours in Normandy, Picardy, and Flanders (1821–23). He showed at the Paris Salon in 1822 and at the famous Salon of 1824 with John Constable, Sir Thomas Lawrence, and others, where he won a gold medal. With Delacroix he studied Constable, and together they went to England (1825), where Bonington learned something of Turner’s skill. More important, both were affected by the English fashion for painting scenes from history. In his subsequent historical pictures, he evolved in oil a new synthesis of Flemish and Venetian techniques. His works were exhibited in London (1826, 1828) and won immediate popularity.
As a master of the Romantic movement and as a technical innovator in oil and watercolour, Bonington was influential in England and France. His gifts as a draftsman were high; as a colourist, good. He also showed his talent in the new medium of lithography, illustrating Sir Walter Scott.
