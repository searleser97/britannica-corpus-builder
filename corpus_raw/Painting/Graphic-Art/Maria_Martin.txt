Maria Martin,  (born July 3, 1796, Charleston, South Carolina, U.S.—died December 27, 1863, Columbia), American artist known for her highly detailed watercolours of flora and fauna, especially those done in collaboration with the naturalist and artist John James Audubon.
Martin displayed interest in the natural sciences and in art at an early age. Little is known of her schooling. From 1827 she lived mainly in the home of a married, older sister who was frequently ill. Her brother-in-law, John Bachman, was a devoted naturalist, and through him she met Audubon in 1831. Audubon’s friendship with her and the Bachman family was strengthened by his two sons’ marriages in 1837 and 1839 to two of Martin’s nieces.
With instruction from Audubon, Martin began developing her artistic talent, and before long she was assisting him in his work by painting in backgrounds for his watercolour portraits of birds. She executed the plants and insects in these backgrounds with remarkable scientific accuracy and with an artist’s eye for colour and composition. Many of the colour plates in Audubon’s four-volume Birds of America (435 hand-coloured plates, 1831–39) featured her work, and it is possible that some of her watercolours of birds may have been touched up and used by Audubon as his own work. In this project she was one of Audubon’s three principal assistants and the only woman.
Her sister died in 1846, and in December 1848 Martin married her widowed brother-in-law. She assisted him in his editorial work for the accompanying text to Audubon’s three-volume Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America (150 plates, 1845–48), and she also contributed a number of drawings to John Edwards Holbrook’s North American Herpetology (1836–42). Audubon named the Maria’s woodpecker (Picus martinae), a subspecies of hairy woodpecker, in her honour.
