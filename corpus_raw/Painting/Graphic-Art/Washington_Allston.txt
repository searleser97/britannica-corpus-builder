Washington Allston,  (born Nov. 5, 1779, Allston plantation, Brook Green Domain on Waccamaw River, S.C., U.S.—died  July 9, 1843, Cambridgeport, Mass.), painter and author, commonly held to be the first important American Romantic painter. Allston is known for his experiments with dramatic subject matter and his use of light and atmospheric colour. Although his production was small, it shaped future American landscape painting by its dramatic portrayals of mood. Allston’s work anticipated that of a line of American visionary painters including Albert Pinkham Ryder and Ralph Blakelock.
Allston graduated from Harvard University in 1800. He studied in London at the Royal Academy and visited the great museums of Paris (1803–04) and Italy (1804–08). During this period he became friendly with the writers Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Washington Irving. Allston spent the years from 1808 to 1811 in Boston. He then spent seven productive years in London and returned to Boston in 1818, finally settling in Cambridgeport, Mass., in 1830.
Before his final return to the United States, Allston’s art was dramatic and large in scale. He delighted in the supernatural; this taste is evident, for example, in “Belshazzar’s Feast” (1817–43). His dramatic landscapes “The Deluge” (1804) and “Elijah in the Desert” (1818) are among the first important achievements of American landscape painting.
After his return to Boston in 1818 Allston’s art became quieter, striking a new note of reverie and fantasy. “Moonlit Landscape” (1819) and “The Flight of Florimel” (1819) are the chief works of the period before he became preoccupied with “Belshazzar’s Feast,” which he had brought unfinished from London. He worked on this from 1820 to 1828 and from 1839 until his death.
Allston was also a writer; his poems, The Sylphs of the Seasons with Other Poems (1813), and a Gothic novel, Monaldi (1841), were popular in his day. His theory of art was posthumously published as Lectures on Art, and Poems (1850).
