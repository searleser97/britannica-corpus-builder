Alexander Cozens,  (born 1717, St. Petersburg, Russia—died  April 23, 1786, London), Russian-born British draftsman and painter who, along with his son John Robert Cozens, was one of the leading watercolourists of the 18th century.
Son of Richard Cozens, shipbuilder to the tsar of Russia, Alexander settled in England after visiting Rome in 1746 and became a fashionable drawing master. William Beckford, author of the Oriental novel Vathek, was his pupil and has preserved almost all that is known of Cozens’ personal characteristics. His fondness for systematization found expression in many publications for artists. A New Method of Assisting the Invention in . . . Landscape (1785) advocated the free manipulation of ink for suggesting compositions, and his own “blots” done in this manner are among his most effective drawings. He exercised considerable influence on the development of English watercolour drawing. His watercolours are carried out almost exclusively in monochrome washes, through which he achieved breadth and atmospheric effect.
