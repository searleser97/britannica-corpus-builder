Bishandas,  (flourished 17th century, India), one of the most skilled portrait painters of the 17th-century Jahāngīr school of Mughal painting. Almost nothing is known of his life, though his name indicates that he was a Hindu.
Bishandas was praised by the emperor Jahāngīr as “unequaled in his age for taking likenesses” and was sent with the embassy to Persia, where he remained from 1613 to 1620, to paint portraits of the shah and the chief members of his court. The portraits so pleased Jahāngīr that Bishandas was honoured with the gift of an elephant. Some of the Mughal portraits of Persian noblemen may be assumed to be the work of Bishandas. He also contributed to the Anwār-e Suhaylī (“The Lights of Canopus”), a book of fables (now in the British Museum), and several fine portraits in the albums made for the emperor.
