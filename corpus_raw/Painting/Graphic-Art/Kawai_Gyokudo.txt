Kawai Gyokudō, , original name Kawai Yoshisaburō,  (born Nov. 24, 1873, Aichi prefecture, Japan—died  June 30, 1957, Tokyo), artist who contributed to the rejuvenation of traditional Japanese painting.
He went to Kyōto in 1887 to study painting under Kōno Bairyū (1844–95), a master of the Shijō school of painting (known for its realism based on sketching). On his teacher’s death he proceeded to Tokyo and studied under Hashimoto Gahō (1835–1908), who belonged to the Kanō school (stressing Chinese subjects and technique). He also studied Western-style painting and developed a highly personal style, especially in the field of landscape painting. Among his representative works are “Futsuka zuki” (“The New Moon”), “Yuku haru” (“The Departing Spring”), “Mine-no-yū” (“Evening at the Mountain Top”), and “Bosetsu” (“Snow in the Evening”).
