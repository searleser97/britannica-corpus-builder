Kim Hong-do, also called Tanwŏn (Korean: “Sandalwood Garden”),  (born 1745?, Korea), one of the first Korean artists to depict the common people in his work.
Born into a family of officials, Kim was early appointed to official rank and made a member of the royal art academy. Nevertheless, he was a spendthrift who was at odds with other officials because of his radical ideas, and he is said to have been constantly in need of funds to support his family. As a painter he became a master of many styles. In his genre paintings he used the ancient linear style, from which he departed, however, in his portrayal of the “Sennin” (“Immortals”), whom he depicts in an unusual heroic style, showing them full-figured and robust.
It was in his landscape paintings that Kim excelled. Following a trend that had begun to develop in Korea in the previous century, he depicted the real world of nature. Going further in this trend than most other artists, he developed an interest in the life of people within natural settings. His paintings of commoners often suggest his critical view toward the upper class, best demonstrated in his harvest scenes, in which hardworking farmers are shown in contrast to the lazy landowner.
