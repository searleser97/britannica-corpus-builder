Bertholet Flémalle, Bertholet also spelled Bertholot, Flémalle also spelled Flemal or Flemael,  (born May 23, 1614, Liège [now in Belgium]—died  July 10, 1675, Liège), Franco-Flemish painter, a pioneer of the classicist movement in his country.
Flémalle studied under Henri Trippet and Gérard Douffet. He went to Italy in 1638, returning via Paris, where he decorated the churches of the Grands Augustines and the Carmes Déchaussés. He returned to Liège in 1663. In 1670 he was elected a member of the Paris Academy, and he painted the ceiling of the audience chamber in the Tuileries (destroyed in 1871).
Flémalle was one of the most important masters of the later Flemish school. His style is modeled on that of the French classicist Nicolas Poussin. Most of his numerous religious pictures in the churches of Liège were destroyed and lost during the French Revolution. However, there are several works still extant in the cathedral, in the churches of Saint-Jean, Saint-Barthelemy, and Sainte-Croix, and in museums. Flémalle was also a distinguished portrait painter.
