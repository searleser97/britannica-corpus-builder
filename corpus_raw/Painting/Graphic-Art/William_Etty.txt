William Etty,  (born March 10, 1787, York, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  Nov. 13, 1849, York), one of the last of the English academic history painters.
In 1807 he was admitted to the Royal Academy schools, and by 1818 he had developed considerable talent as a portraitist. The grand but simply conceived “Combat” (1825) brought him his first great success. During the last decade of his life, bad health, economic pressure, and unenlightened patronage forced him to concentrate on minor pieces that sold easily. His nude studies, which date from this period, are still admired.
