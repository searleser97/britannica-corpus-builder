John Wesley Jarvis,  (born 1781, South Shields, Durham, England—died January 14, 1840, New York, New York, U.S.), American painter considered his era’s leading portraitist based in New York City.
Growing up in Philadelphia, where he gained some knowledge of art from sign makers, Jarvis was apprenticed in 1800 to Edward Savage, a New York engraver and painter. Later, in partnership with Joseph Wood, he painted profiles and miniatures. He traveled to major cities, such as Baltimore, Maryland, and Charleston, South Carolina, for commissions while maintaining headquarters in New York, where, in 1815, he profited from exhibiting Adolf Ulrik Wertmüller’s controversial painting, Danaë.
While in Louisiana Jarvis established an important studio, collaborating with, among others, Henry Inman, who had served Jarvis for seven years as apprentice and assistant, and John Quidor. By the time he met John James Audubon in 1821 in New Orleans, Jarvis was in his prime and had become a dandy of exotic bohemian proportions. After the War of 1812 the Common Council commissioned him to paint huge republican portraits for the city hall of New York; among them is the famous Oliver H. Perry (1815–17).
