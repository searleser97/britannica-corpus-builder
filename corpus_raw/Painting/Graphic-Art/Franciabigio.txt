Franciabigio, also called Francesco di Cristofano, Francesco Giudini, or Francesco Giudici,  (born 1482/83, Florence [Italy]—died  1525, Florence), Italian Renaissance painter, best known for his portraits and religious paintings. His style included early Renaissance, High Renaissance, and proto-Mannerist elements.
Franciabigio had completed an apprenticeship under his father, a weaver, by 1504. He probably then trained under the Italian painter Mariotto Albertinelli before forming a joint workshop with a leading Florentine painter, Andrea del Sarto, about 1506. Their relationship became tense after 1509, when Andrea began receiving more commissions and more praise for his work, and Franciabigio began to live in his shadow.
Franciabigio’s early style is filled with movement and attention to descriptive detail strongly reminiscent of 15th-century Italian painting. He was attracted to the Florentine works of Raphael, as can be seen in his Madonna del Pozzo (c. 1508). In the atrium of the Annunziata in Florence he painted the Marriage of the Virgin (1513) as a portion of a series in which Andrea was chiefly concerned. When the friars uncovered this work before it was quite finished, Franciabigio was so incensed that, seizing a mason’s hammer, he struck at the head of the Virgin and some other heads, and the fresco, which would otherwise be his masterpiece in that medium, was mutilated.
For a number of years, Franciabigio maintained the studio with Andrea. Together with Andrea’s student, Jacopo da Pontormo, they decorated the Medici villa at Poggio a Caiano, where Franciabigio’s Triumph of Caesar displays his talent for narrative painting. Andrea’s influence on Franciabigio may be seen in the dark, smoky background and the soft, dramatic lighting of the St. Job Altar (1516). One of his best-known later paintings is his Story of Bathsheba (1523), which brings to mind the poses of some of Michelangelo’s figures on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
