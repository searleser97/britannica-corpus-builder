Cornelius Krieghoff,  (born June 19, 1815, Amsterdam, Neth.—died March 8, 1872, Chicago, Ill., U.S.), Dutch-Canadian painter. After studying in Düsseldorf, he emigrated to New York about 1837 and later moved to Canada. Working in Montreal and Quebec, he produced more than 2,000 images of American Indian and French-Canadian life and colourful landscapes in a detailed, romanticized, anecdotal style that was unsurpassed by contemporary artists. He became very popular, and his work was much imitated and forged.
