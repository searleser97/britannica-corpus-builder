Anders Zorn, in full Anders Leonard Zorn,  (born Feb. 18, 1860, Mora, Swed.â€”died  1920, Mora), Swedish painter and etcher, internationally famed as one of the best genre and portrait painters in Europe at the end of the 19th century.
Zorn studied at the Stockholm academy and then travelled extensively throughout Europe. After working in England, France, and the United States, he returned to Mora in 1896.
Zorn painted Impressionist landscapes and portraits in both watercolour and oil; he is best known for the vigorous style of his paintings of peasant girls bathing. He did his best work in etching, employing a technique of drawing parallel lines across the plate. He was also a sculptor.
