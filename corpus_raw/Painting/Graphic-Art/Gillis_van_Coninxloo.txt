Gillis van Coninxloo,  (born Jan. 24, 1544, probably Antwerp, Flanders [now in Belgium]—buried Jan. 4, 1607, Amsterdam, Neth.), Flemish landscape painter whose works show the transition from Mannerist to early Baroque landscape.
Coninxloo studied under, among others, Pieter Coecke van Aelst, a painter of the Antwerp school of Mannerism. After a period of travel in France, he returned to Antwerp in 1570 and was made a member of the painters’ guild. He left his home again in 1585 to escape religious persecution and stayed at Frankenthal in the Palatinate until 1595, when he settled in Amsterdam.
The development of Coninxloo’s style is often described in three periods that somewhat correspond with his residence in Antwerp (1570–88), Frankenthal (1588–95), and Amsterdam (1595–1606). His earlier works are deliberately composed landscape fantasies reflecting the influence of the Italianate Flemish landscapist Paul Brill. Coninxloo’s later landscapes are more naturalistic and are characterized by their blending of colour into a harmonious atmospheric tone.
