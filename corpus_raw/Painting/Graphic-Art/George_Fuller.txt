George Fuller,  (born January 17, 1822, Deerfield, Massachusetts, U.S.—died March 21, 1884, Brookline, Massachusetts), American painter noted for his haunting, dreamlike pictures of figures set in landscape—e.g., The Gatherer of Simples (1878–83).
Fuller began his formal training at the studio of Henry Kirke Brown. At first an itinerant portraitist, he settled in New York City about 1847 and enjoyed moderate success there. After the death of his father and brother in 1859, Fuller retired to Deerfield, Massachusetts, to assume responsibility for the family farm. He continued to paint for pleasure, and in 1876, pressed for money, he sent some paintings to Boston. These works attracted much attention, and thereafter he never lacked patrons. Fuller is especially remembered for his introspective later works, notably The Quadroon (1880) and Psyche (1882).
