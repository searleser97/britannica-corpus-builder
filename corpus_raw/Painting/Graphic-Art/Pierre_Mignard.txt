Pierre Mignard, byname Mignard le Romain,  (born Nov. 17, 1612, Troyes, France—died May 30, 1695, Paris), painter in the classical French Baroque manner, known primarily for his court portraits.
In 1635 Mignard left the studio of Simon Vouet for Italy, where he spent 22 years and made a reputation that brought him a summons to Paris in 1657. Successful with his portrait of Louis XIV and in favour with the court, Mignard pitted himself against Charles Le Brun; he declined to enter the French Royal Academy, of which Le Brun was the head, and he organized the opposition to its authority. In spite of the deserved success of his decorations of the cupola of the Church of Val-de-Grâce (1664), Mignard was excluded from any great share in work for public projects, such assignments being under the control of the new academy. Mignard accordingly was chiefly active in portraiture; many of the beauties and celebrities of his day sat for him, including Molière, the viscount de Turenne, Jacques Bossuet, the marquise de Maintenon, the marquise de Sévigné, and the marquise de Montespan. His skillful technique and graceful arrangements are noteworthy.
With the death of Le Brun (1690), Mignard deserted his allies and succeeded to all the posts held by his opponent. These late honours he did not long enjoy. He died while about to commence work on the cupola of the Hôtel des Invalides. His brother Nicolas Mignard (1606–68) and his nephew Paul Mignard (c. 1638–91) were also accomplished painters.
