A.Y. Jackson, in full Alexander Young Jackson,  (born Oct. 3, 1882, Montreal, Que., Can.â€”died April 5, 1974, Kleinburg, Ont.), Canadian landscape painter. He traveled to every region of Canada, including the Arctic; from 1921 on, he returned every spring to a favourite spot on the St. Lawrence River, where he produced sketches that he later executed in paint. Over a long career he became a leading artistic figure in his country. His easy style, featuring rolling rhythms and rich, full colour, exerted a strong influence on Canadian landscape painting.
