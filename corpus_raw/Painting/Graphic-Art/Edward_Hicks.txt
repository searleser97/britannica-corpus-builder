Edward Hicks,  (born April 4, 1780, Attleboro, Pa., U.S.—died  Aug. 23, 1849, Newtown, Pa.), American primitive, or folk, painter known for his naive depictions of the farms and landscape of Pennsylvania and New York, and especially for his many versions (about 25 extant, perhaps 100 painted) of The Peaceable Kingdom. The latter work depicts Hicks’s belief, as a Quaker, that Pennsylvania was the fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy (11:6–9) of justice and gentleness between all men and beasts. William Penn and other Quakers appear on the left of the picture, making their treaty with the Indians, while Isaiah’s beasts are gathered on the right with little children playing among them. The landscape, figures, and animals make a charmingly awkward pageant of the Quakers’ ideas.
Hicks came to art late. A painter of coaches and signs in early life, for many years he devoted all his serious energies to his avocation of preaching. It was as a preacher that he was celebrated among his contemporaries, and the 3,000 mourners at his funeral grieved at the loss of a favourite minister. He began to make easel paintings when he was in middle age, and with some reluctance. Although he feared that art was contrary to religion, he testified that it could sometimes bring meaning to life. Unable to make a painting without an apparent moral, he often framed a picture with edifying verse of his own composition, like that surrounding his view of Niagara Falls.
