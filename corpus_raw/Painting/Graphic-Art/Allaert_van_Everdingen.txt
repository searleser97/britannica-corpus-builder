Allaert van Everdingen,  (born June 18, 1621, Alkmaar, the Netherlands—died November 8, 1675, Amsterdam), Dutch painter and engraver known for his landscapes recalling the scenery of Scandinavia.
According to the Dutch art historian Arnold Houbraken, Everdingen studied under Roelant Savery at Utrecht and under Pieter de Molijn at Haarlem. He eventually settled in Amsterdam. His earlier works include some seascapes, but his characteristic pictures are northern landscapes with mountains, forests, log huts, and waterfalls. These scenes were inspired by a visit he made to Sweden soon after 1640, and their motifs influenced Jacob van Ruisdael in his landscapes. Everdingen illustrated Hendrick van Alcmar’s Reynard the Fox with 57 etchings of animals.
