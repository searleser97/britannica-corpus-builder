Francisco Bayeu, in full Francisco Bayeu Y Subías,  (born March 9, 1734, Zaragoza, Spain—died  Aug. 4, 1795, Madrid), painter, the brother-in-law of Francisco de Goya and court painter to King Charles III of Spain. Considered by his contemporaries to be the finest Spanish painter of the period, he was greatly influenced by Anton Raphael Mengs and the Italian Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, both painters at the court of Charles.
After studying in Zaragoza under José Luzán Martínez and in Madrid under Antonio González Velázquez, Bayeu was called by Mengs to assist in the decoration of the royal palace in 1763. He created frescoes for the Cathedral of El Pilar in Zaragoza, the Toledo Cathedral, and the royal palaces in Madrid, El Pardo, La Granja, and Aranjuez. Bayeu’s mature style was a mixture of French Rococo and the academic classicism of Mengs. Although his drawings, hundreds of which have been preserved, are beautifully animated, his finished frescoes have an academic stiffness. His brothers Ramon and Manuel were also painters.
