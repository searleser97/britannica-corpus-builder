Ni Zan, Wade-Giles romanization Ni Tsan, literary name (hao) Yunlin, courtesy name (zi) Yuanzhen,  (born 1301, Wuxi, Jiangsu province, China—died 1374), one of the group of Chinese painters later known as the Four Masters of the Yuan dynasty (1206–1368).
Although Ni was born to wealth, he chose not to serve the foreign Mongol dynasty of the Yuan and instead lived a life of retirement and cultivated the scholarly arts (poetry, painting, and calligraphy), collected artistic works of the past, and associated with those of a similar temperament. He was characterized by his contemporaries as particularly quiet and fastidious, qualities that are found in his paintings. He was much imitated by later painters, and therefore originals by him are difficult to authenticate. Generally it may be said that in his paintings, usually landscapes, he used elements sparingly, used ink monochrome only, and left great areas of the paper untouched. There is often a rustic hut, without any further suggestion of human presence, a few trees and other scant indications of plant life, and elemental landforms with a sombre quiet throughout.
The art of Ni and his peers in the Yuan dynasty was opposed to the preceding standards of the Southern Song academy, whose art immediately appealed to the eyes through obvious displays of virtuoso brushwork and a convincing pictorial reality. Ni’s new style demanded concentrated viewing so that the larger and, in fact, more complex plays of ink could be perceived. Toward the end of his life Ni is said to have distributed all of his possessions among his friends and adopted the life of a Daoist recluse, wandering and painting in his mature style. After the restoration of Chinese rule under the Ming dynasty in 1368, he returned to urban life.
