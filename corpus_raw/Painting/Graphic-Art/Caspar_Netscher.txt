Caspar Netscher, Caspar also spelled Gaspar,  (born 1639, Heidelberg, Palatinate [Germany]—died January 15, 1684, The Hague, Netherlands), German painter of the Baroque era who established a fashionable practice as a portrait painter.
Netscher was reared in Arnhem, where his first master was Hendrick Coster, and he later studied with Gerard Terborch. In 1659 he set out by sea for Rome but went no farther than Bordeaux, France. By 1662 he had settled in The Hague. Netscher’s earlier genre pieces are closely related to the works of Gabriel Metsu and Terborch, from whom he acquired great skill in rendering textures. The Lace-Maker is an example of this style. The later biblical and mythological subjects and the small, glossy portraits that made his reputation in his lifetime tend to be superficial despite their elegance. Netscher’s sons Theodoor (1661–1728) and Constantijn (1668–1723) were among his many pupils and imitators.
