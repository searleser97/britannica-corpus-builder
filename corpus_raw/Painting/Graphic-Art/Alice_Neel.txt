Alice Neel, in full Alice Hartley Neel,  (b. January 28, 1900, Merion Square [now Gladwyne], Pennsylvania, U.S.—d. October 13, 1984, New York, New York), American realist painter celebrated for her honest and expressive portraits, produced at a time when Abstract Expressionism was the prevailing style in American painting.
Neel grew up in a small suburb of Philadelphia, where her overbearing mother and debilitating boredom cultivated her rebellious spirit. She enrolled in art courses (1918–21) before entering the Philadelphia School of Design for Women (1921–25; now the Moore College of Art and Design). In 1925 Neel married Carlos Enriquez, a wealthy Cuban with whom she spent two years living, painting, and exhibiting in Havana. The couple had two daughters but lost their first child to diphtheria in 1927 once they were back in New York. When Enriquez abandoned her and took their second child (born 1928) back to Cuba in 1930, Neel suffered a nervous breakdown. At risk for suicide, she spent nearly a year in a mental hospital. Her paintings, which served as an emotional outlet for the traumatic nature of her life, depicted destitute mothers, children, and fellow psychiatric patients; all were portrayed in a distorted, Expressionist style. With the help of her art, Neel gradually healed and was released in 1931.
Neel entered into a series of precarious romantic relationships between 1931 and 1940. Her partners—who ranged from a nightclub entertainer to a Marxist intellectual—were often the subjects of her work, as seen in the graphite and crayon Joie de vivre (1935). In 1934 her drug-addicted lover Kenneth Doolittle destroyed more than 350 of her paintings and drawings, material that had not been photographed or documented in any way.
Neel became involved in government art projects during the ’30s but dedicated most of her energy to producing unconventional portraits of common people living in Greenwich Village and Harlem. Examples of portrait subjects from that period are bohemian and Greenwich Village eccentric Joe Gould (1933) and writers Pat Whalen and Kenneth Fearing (both painted 1935). Neel had her first solo exhibition in New York City in 1938.
Neel’s raw, intimate paintings reflected conditions of poverty and disease with unparalleled honesty. T.B. Harlem (1940) depicts with disturbing candour a man suffering from tuberculosis. Her model was Carlos Negrón, the brother of her lover José Santiago. Family was a persistent theme throughout Neel’s career. She painted the families in her neighbourhoods, her own children as they grew up, scenes of mothers and daughters, and in the 1960s and ’70s several friends and relatives in the nude late in their pregnancies, focusing on the transformation of the body to accommodate the growing fetus (Pregnant Maria [1964], Pregnant Julie and Algis [1967], Pregnant Betty Homitzky [1968], Pregnant Woman [1971], Margaret Evans Pregnant [1978]). The subjects in many of Neel’s works were nude; their vulnerability contributed to the depth of the realistic—and often unforgiving—portraits. Neel’s nude self-portrait made at age 81 (1980) became one of her best-known works.
In the 1960s she began to paint portraits of fellow artists, art critics, and collectors; she later extended her work to include noteworthy individuals such as Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling (1969), composer Virgil Thomson (1971), artists Andy Warhol (1970), Marisol (1981), Duane Hanson (1972), and Faith Ringgold (1976), art historian Linda Nochlin with her daughter (1973), and art historian Meyer Schapiro (1983).
Neel did not receive significant recognition until the 1970s. She was given her first retrospective in 1974 at the Whitney Museum of American Art. She was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1976, and three years later the National Women’s Caucus for Art recognized her “outstanding achievement in the visual arts.”
