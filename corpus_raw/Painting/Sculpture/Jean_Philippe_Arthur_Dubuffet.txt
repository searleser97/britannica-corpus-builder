Jean Dubuffet,  (born July 31, 1901, Le Havre, Fr.—died May 12, 1985, Paris), French painter, sculptor, and printmaker, best known for his development of art brut (q.v.; “raw art”).
As an art student in Paris, Dubuffet demonstrated a facility for academic painting. In 1924, however, he gave up his painting, and by 1930 was making a living as a wine merchant. He did not return to a full-time art career until the early 1940s.
After World War II, as one of the leading artists of the School of Paris, he developed the techniques and philosophy of art brut. Derived from Dubuffet’s studies of the art of children and of the mentally ill, art brut is intended to achieve immediacy and vitality of expression not found in self-conscious, academic art. To reflect these qualities, Dubuffet often used crude ideographic images incised into a rough impasto surface made up of such materials as tar, gravel, cinders, ashes, and sand bound with varnish and glue. His drawings and paintings are by turns childlike and obsessive, and their unfinished appearance excited much controversy.
During the 1960s Dubuffet experimented with musical composition and the creation of architectural environments. In various graphic and sculptural mediums he continued to explore the potentials of art brut. In his later years he also created several large sculptures of black-and-white painted fiberglass for various public spaces.
