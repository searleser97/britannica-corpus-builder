Euphranor,  (flourished c. 390–c. 325 bc), Greek sculptor and painter from Corinth, contemporary of Praxiteles. In the Stoa Basileios at Athens he painted the “Twelve Gods,” “Theseus with Democracy and Demos,” and the cavalry engagement at Mantinea (362); none of these works survives. At Ephesus he depicted the feigned madness of Odysseus. Fragments of a colossal statue found in the Agora at Athens have been identified as his “Apollo Patroos.” Other recorded statues are “Leto with Her Children Apollo and Artemis,” “Philip,” and “Paris and Alexander in Chariots.” He also wrote on proportion and colour.
