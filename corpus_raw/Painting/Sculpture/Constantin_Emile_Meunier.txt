Constantin Meunier, in full Constantin Emile Meunier,  (born April 12, 1831, Etterbeek, Belgium—died April 4, 1905, Ixelles), Belgian sculptor and painter, one of the principal social-realist artists of the late 19th century in Europe.
Meunier began his career as a sculptor, but during the years 1857–84 he pursued only painting. After visiting some mines and factories, Meunier demonstrated in his paintings a humanitarian interest in labourers, focusing particularly on the miners of the Borinage, dockworkers of Antwerp, metalworkers, and women labourers.
In 1882, under the sponsorship of the Belgian government, Meunier went to Spain, where he produced paintings primarily on religious subjects. After returning to Belgium, he began to explore in bronze sculpture the social themes that had dominated his earlier paintings. The empathy and respect with which he viewed his subjects (e.g., The Fire-Damp Explosion, 1887) renders Meunier’s work universal rather than political. His notable works include The Docker (1905) and a large sculptural group, Monument to Labour, which was installed in the Place de Trooz, Brussels, in 1930.
