Eric Fischl ,  (born March 9, 1948, New York, New York, U.S.), American painter and sculptor whose work belongs to the figurative tradition.
Fischl moved with his family in 1967 from New York City to Phoenix, where he attended art school. He then transferred to the California Institute of the Arts before moving to Chicago, where he worked as a guard at the Museum of Contemporary Art while continuing his studies. He joined the faculty of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in 1974 and then returned to New York in 1978. He later became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Science, and his work was widely exhibited.
Fischlâ€™s first solo show, at the Edward Thorp Gallery in 1979, centred on the experience of suburbia and the darker shadows thereof, such as angst and alcoholism, topics not often addressed in painting and for which he received some criticism. Some of his early work was done on nontraditional media, such as chromecoat and glassine paper; he also worked in more-conventional formats, such as oil on canvas and watercolour. In the late 1980s he also turned to sculpture, favouring small bronzes at first and then producing larger, even monumental pieces, such as his memorial to the tennis player Arthur Ashe (2000) in Queens, New York. His sculpture Tumbling Woman (2002) generated some controversy when it was first exhibited: commemorating the bodies that had so recently fallen from the World Trade Center in the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, it was felt to touch too raw a wound.
