Sargent Johnson, in full Sargent Claude Johnson,  (born October 7, 1887, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died October 10, 1967, San Francisco, California), versatile American artist known especially for his paintings and sculptures of African American subjects. By his own account, he was concerned with
Johnson’s father, who died in 1897, was of Swedish ancestry, and his mother, who died in 1902, was of African American and Cherokee ancestry. Johnson studied at Worcester Art School and moved to the San Francisco area in 1915. He worked in wood, copper, terra-cotta, cast stone, and black clay, and he endeavoured to focus on African American subjects. Johnson was a versatile artist who showed the influences of African sculpture as well as Mexican and European Cubist art. He won a medal at the San Francisco Art Exhibition in 1925. From 1926 to 1935 his sculpture was exhibited by the Harmon Foundation, an organization (1922–67) that helped to support African American arts. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, he worked for the Works Progress Administration as an artist and supervisor with the Federal Arts Project in San Francisco. There he created a 1937 carved redwood panel that is in the collection of Huntington Library, San Marino, California. Another of his well-known works is Forever Free (1933), a painted wood sculpture of a mother and two children. He received grants in 1944 and 1949 and used the money to travel and to study sculpture. From 1947 to 1967 he experimented with new materials, including porcelain on steel panels, cast bronze, and forged enameled wire. Despite having lived in San Francisco for most of his adult life, Johnson is considered one of the stellar artists of the Harlem Renaissance. He won the Harmon Foundation medal for outstanding African American artist three times.
