André Lhote,  (born July 5, 1885, Bordeaux, France—died January 24, 1962, Paris), French painter, sculptor, writer, and educator who was a prominent critic and teacher of modern art.
Lhote studied decorative sculpture at the École des Beaux-Arts in Bordeaux from 1898 to 1904. About 1905 he took up painting, and a year later he moved to Paris. Lhote initially painted colourful landscapes in a Fauvist style, but his mature works, such as Rugby (1917), are Cubist in manner.
Lhote’s most significant work was not as a visual artist, however, but rather as a writer who articulated Cubist theories and as an educator who influenced a generation of French artists. In 1922 he founded his own art school in Paris, the Académie Montparnasse. Lhote was an art critic for La Nouvelle Revue Française from 1917 until 1940, and he also wrote important treatises on landscape painting (1939) and figure painting (1950).
