Jack Butler Yeats,  (born August 23, 1871, London, England—died March 28, 1957, Dublin, Ireland), most important Irish painter of the 20th century. His scenes of daily life and Celtic mythology contributed to the surge of nationalism in the Irish arts after the Irish War of Independence (1919–21).
Jack Butler Yeats was the son of John Butler Yeats, a well-known portrait painter, and he was the brother of the poet William Butler Yeats. He was privately educated in Sligo, Ireland, and he then attended various art schools in London, including the Westminster School of Art. His early work was mainly confined to illustrations for books and broadsheets produced by his sisters at the Dun Emer Press, later the Cuala Press of Dundrum near Dublin, as well as for periodicals such as Punch.
Yeats initially painted in watercolour, but about 1906 he began painting regularly in oil. His early paintings were rather conservative in style. During the years of the Irish struggle for independence, Yeats began to acquire fame for his romantic and emotional, yet realistic, portrayals of urban and rural life in Ireland.
In the 1920s Yeats’s painting style underwent a major change. He adopted a more colourful palette, and he began to paint with extremely free and loose brushstrokes. His subject matter included modern scenes of circuses, music halls, and horse races, moody landscapes of Ireland’s west coast, and themes from Irish mythology.
After his death, critics often dismissed Yeats’s work as irrelevant, but a 1971 exhibition of his paintings at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin helped to revive his reputation as an important artist. Yeats was also a writer, and his literary works—plays, novels, and poetry—are characterized by the same qualities of fantasy and colourful, haphazard expression that are apparent in his paintings.
