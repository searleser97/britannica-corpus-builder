Jean-Baptiste Oudry,   (born March 17, 1686, Paris, France—died  April 30, 1755, Beauvais), French Rococo painter, tapestry designer, and illustrator, considered one of the greatest animal painters of the 18th century.
Oudry first studied portrait painting with Nicolas de Largillière, a portraitist of Parisian society, through whom he made many connections. His early portraits are often arcadian in setting and tender and sentimentally charming in the Rococo tradition. In his early career he executed many still lifes that were used as decorative inserts for paneled rooms. After he was made a member of the French Royal Academy in 1719, his work consisted largely of animal paintings, tapestry designs, and book illustrations.
In 1734 Oudry was made head of the Beauvais tapestry works. Some of his designs brought the company wide fame, such as those for the tapestry series “Country Amusements” (1730), “Moliere’s Comedies” (1732), and “The Fables of La Fontaine” (1736). The designs for the last series were related to the 277 illustrations Oudry did for a four-volume edition of the Fables. His other book illustrations included those for editions of Don Quixote and Le Roman comique. In 1736 he was made inspector general of the Gobelins tapestry factory and designed a series of tapestries (1736–49) depicting the hunts of Louis XV. He was also commissioned to paint the dogs of the king’s pack and was appointed official painter of the royal hunts. Oudry’s tapestries, like his paintings, were highly regarded for their tonal subtlety and lively study of nature. Among his later still lifes is the well-known “White Duck” (1753), a tour de force of precise drawing and delicate white-on-white tonalities. Oudry’s services were sought not only by Louis XV but by Tsar Peter the Great of Russia, the queen of Sweden, and the prince of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
