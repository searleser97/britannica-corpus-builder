Brygos Painter, Brygos also spelled Brygus,  (flourished c. 490–470 bc), signature appearing on several cups and vases of Greek red-figure pottery executed in the late 6th or early 5th century bc. Because it is not known whether the signature is that of the potter or of the painter, the artisans are called, by convention, the Brygos Potter and the Brygos Painter, though they may have been one person.
The Brygos Painter is best known for a kylix (drinking cup), frequently called the Brygos Cup, now in the Louvre, Paris. A work of about 490 bc, it depicts the “Iliupersis” (“The Sack of Troy”). Several other vessels thought to have been decorated by the Brygos Painter include a kylix, “Youth Carrying a Skyphos”; a cup, “Dionysus with a Troop of Maenads and Satyrs”; and another cup, “Satyrs Attacking Iris and Hera.” The Brygos Painter is known for drinking-party scenes as well as more formal mythological scenes. The naturalness of his forms and the flow of his draperies are consonant with the early Classical period in ancient Greece, but his energetic figures and lively compositions distinguish his personal manner.
