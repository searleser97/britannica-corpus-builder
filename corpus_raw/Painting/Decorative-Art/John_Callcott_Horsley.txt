John Callcott Horsley,  (born January 29, 1817, London, England—died October 18, 1903, London), British narrative painter best known as the designer of the first Christmas card. Created in 1843 for Callcott’s friend Sir Henry Cole, an edition of 1,000 cards was placed on sale in London. It was lithographed on stiff cardboard, 51/8 by 31/4 inches, in dark sepia and hand-coloured. The card is a triptych; the centre shows a family party in progress, beneath which is the greeting “A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to You.” The side panels depict acts of charity, with the poor being given food and clothing.
As a painter he was called “Mr. J. C(lothes) Horsley” because of his protests against paintings of the nude. A pupil of the Royal Academy, he achieved popular success before the age of 20, although he was criticized for his failure to master the fundamentals of structure and movement because of his reluctance to study the nude model.
