Charles Locke Eastlake,  (born March 11, 1836, Plymouth, Devon, Eng.—died  Nov. 20, 1906, London), English museologist and writer on art who gave his name to a 19th-century furniture style.
The nephew of the Neoclassical painter Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, he studied architecture at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, which in 1854 awarded him a silver medal for architectural drawing. Giving up that discipline, he studied art on the European continent, then returned to England to write and to design. In 1856 he married Eliza Bailey (d. 1911). In London he was secretary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (1866–77) and keeper and secretary of the National Gallery (1878–98). There he reorganized the classification of paintings and initiated the use of glass to protect the works from the increasingly polluted London air.
As a writer on painting and industrial arts, Eastlake enjoyed a peerless reputation. More of a reformer of furniture style than an originator, he was a leading exponent of Jacobean and Gothic Revival, and he strongly influenced furniture and architectural tastes of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. He was against the substitution of machine manufacture for quality workmanship. (Nevertheless, after Philadelphia’s Centennial Exposition [1876], American Eastlake furniture was mass-produced.)
Eastlake’s influential Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and Other Details (1868) was in its 6th edition in the United States by 1881 and in its 4th in London by 1887. His Lectures on Decorative Art and Art Workmanship (1876) was followed by the progressively published series Notes on the Principal Pictures in such continental collections as the Brera (1883) of Milan, the Louvre (1883), and the Royal Gallery (1888) in Venice.
