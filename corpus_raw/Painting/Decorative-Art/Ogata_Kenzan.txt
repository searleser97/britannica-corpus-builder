Ogata Kenzan, original name Ogata Shinsei, also called Kenzan,  (born 1663, Kyōto, Japan—died June 3, 1743, Edo [now Tokyo]), Japanese potter and painter, brother to the artist Ogata Kōrin. He signed himself Kenzan, Shisui, Tōin, Shōkosai, Shuseidō, or Shinshō.
Kenzan received a classical Chinese and Japanese education and pursued Zen Buddhism. At the age of 27 he began studying with the potter Ninsei and in 1699 established his own kiln in Narutaki. Encountering financial difficulties, he moved in 1712 to Nijō, in central Kyōto, where he established another kiln. But difficulties pursued him there, and in 1731 he moved to Edo and built still another kiln.
In the 40 years of his working life, Kenzan produced quantities of pottery. His output included stoneware and porcelain. He used various techniques in ornamentation, his iro-e (“colour painting”) being especially good. Many of his designs reflect his classical Chinese and Japanese education. He also produced many paintings, especially in the last five years of his life. His calligraphy, as seen in his wares and his paintings, was distinctive in style. His best-known works include a hexagonal plate with a design of Jurōjin, the god of longevity, a joint work with his brother Kōrin; a plate with a picture of a cedar grove; the Hana-kago (“Flower Baskets”), a watercolour hanging scroll; and the Yatsuhashi (“Eight Bridges”), a painting of a scenic attraction in Mikawa province (modern Aichi prefecture).
