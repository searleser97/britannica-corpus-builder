John La Farge,  (born March 31, 1835, New York, New York, U.S.—died November 14, 1910, Providence, Rhode Island), American painter, muralist, and stained-glass designer.
After graduating from St. Mary’s College in Maryland, La Farge studied law, but in 1856 he went to Europe to study art. He worked independently, studying briefly in Paris with Thomas Couture and coming under the influence of the work of the Pre-Raphaelites in England. Returning to the United States, in 1859 La Farge went to Newport, Rhode Island, where he studied with the artist William Morris Hunt.
La Farge produced landscapes and figure compositions in the 1860s and was among the earliest American painters to adopt the stylistic elements derived from progressive French landscape painting of the mid-19th century as well as from Japanese prints, which he collected. He took up mural painting in 1876 with a commission to decorate the interior of Trinity Church in Boston. His finest mural is the Ascension (1887), in the Church of the Ascension in New York City. He also decorated the homes of William Watts Sherman and Cornelius Vanderbilt II and painted murals in New York’s Union League Club. About the same time, he became interested in stained glass. Through his invention of opalescent glass and his imaginative designing, he contributed to a revival of the art of stained glass in America and gained an international reputation.
In later life La Farge traveled to exotic places, painting a notable series of watercolour scenes during his trips to Japan and the South Pacific in the late 1880s and early ’90s. His writings include Considerations on Painting (1895), An Artist’s Letters from Japan (1897), and The Higher Life in Art (1908).
