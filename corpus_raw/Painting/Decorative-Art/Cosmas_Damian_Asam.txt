Cosmas Damian Asam,  (born September 29, 1686, Benediktbeuren, Bavaria [Germany]—died May 10, 1739, Munich), German fresco painter and principal late Baroque exponent of illusionist decoration. He, along with his brother Egid Quirin Asam, produced works notable for their profound and dramatic intensity of religious feeling.
Asam was a son of Hans Georg Asam, the leading Bavarian fresco painter of his generation. He studied in Rome with Pier Leone Ghezzi in 1712–14 and went on to work with Egid Quirin, who was an architect and a sculptor. The brothers’ first religious commissions show the influence of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, especially in the concept of the theatrum sacrum, or sacred theatre, in which all decorative elements combine to involve the spectator in a vivid religious drama. In many of their creations, the complex interweaving of architectural and decorative elements makes it difficult for the observer to distinguish the brothers’ individual contributions.
The Church of St. John of Nepomuk in Munich (1733–46), also known as the Asamkirche in honour of the brothers, is their masterwork and is an early contribution to the Bavarian Rococo style. The high, narrow interior, mysteriously lit from above, is richly decorated with paint, stuccowork, sculpture, and gilt. The ceiling is decorated with painted figures ascending into a space that seems to transcend architectural boundaries.
The brothers sometimes collaborated in the decoration of buildings designed by others, such as Johann Michael Fischer’s Premonstratensian abbey church in Osterhofen (1726–28; decoration c. 1730). Their other major collaborations include the cloister church in the Benedictine abbey of Weltenburg (1716–21) and the Ursuline church at Straubing (1738–41), for which Cosmas planned the light Rococo interior, completed after Cosmas’s death in 1739 by Egid Quirin.
