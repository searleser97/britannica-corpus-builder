Junayd,   (flourished  14th century, Iraq), painter of miniatures and leading illustrator of the Jalāyirid school. His style, using richly dressed figures in formal settings, deeply influenced later developments in Persian painting.
Very little is known about Junayd’s life. He was a pupil of the painter Shams ad-Dīn, and from 1382 to 1410 he worked in the service of Sultan Aḥmad of the Mongol Jalāyirid dynasty of Baghdad.
He perpetuated the traditions of the great artists of the late Il Khan period of the Tabrīz school, where Shams ad-Dīn had been trained. The result was a jewellike, multifaceted art that formed some of the basic patterns later adapted by Persian miniature painters.
His work includes illustrations for Khwājū Kermānī’s Khamseh (“Five Poems”), completed in 1396, and margin illustrations for Sultan Aḥmad’s Dīvān.
