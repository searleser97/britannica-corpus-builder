Ludovico Cigoli, in full Ludovico Cardi da Cigoli,  (born Sept. 21, 1559, Cigoli [Italy]—died  June 8, 1613, Rome), Italian painter, architect, and poet whose work reflected the many crosscurrents in Italian art between the decline of Michelangelesque Mannerism and the beginnings of the Baroque.
Cigoli worked both in Florence and in Rome. In Florence he worked with the late-Mannerist painters Alessandro Allori and Santi di Tito, as well as the architect Bernardo Buontalenti. Cigoli was a rationalist and a scientific artist who followed the call made by the Counter-Reformation for a greater degree of clarity and directness in religious painting. These qualities are well illustrated in his Ecce Homo (c. 1607). After the 1590s his style took on a quality described by Giovanni Battista Cardi, his nephew and biographer, as “beautiful and graceful” (e.g., Martyrdom of St. Stephen, 1597). His architecture (e.g., the court of the Palazzo Nonfinito, Florence, 1604) shows Palladian elements.
