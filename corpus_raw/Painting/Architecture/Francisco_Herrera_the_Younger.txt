Francisco Herrera, the Younger, Spanish El Joven, or El Mozo,  (born 1622, Sevilla, Spain—died August 25, 1685, Madrid), painter and architect who figured prominently in the development of the Spanish Baroque style in Sevilla (Seville) and Madrid.
He was the son and pupil of Francisco Herrera the Elder. After fleeing from his father (who was noted for his bad temper), Herrera the Younger is said to have continued his studies in Rome, where he became famous for paintings of still life with fish and was known as lo spagnuolo degli pesci (“the Spaniard of the fishes”). As a painter he is known only for a few religious compositions. The Triumph of St. Hermengild (c. 1660–70) and The Ecstasy of St. Francis (1657), painted for Sevilla Cathedral on his return from Italy, both reflect the violent movement and theatrical effect of the Roman Baroque style, which he probably introduced into Sevilla.
In 1660 Herrera the Younger was appointed vice president under Bartolomé Murillo of the newly founded Academy of Painting in Sevilla; but he soon left for Madrid, where he was active as a painter of frescoes and altarpieces and as a designer of retables. In 1672 he was appointed painter to the king and in 1677 surveyor general. As an architect he is said to have been the first to introduce the style of Francesco Borromini into Spain; and his design for the high altar of the Church of Montserrat, Madrid, possibly influenced the architect and sculptor José Benito Churriguera.
