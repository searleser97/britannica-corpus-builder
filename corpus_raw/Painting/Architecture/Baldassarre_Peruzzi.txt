Baldassarre Peruzzi,  (born Jan. 15, 1481, Anciano, Republic of Siena [Italy]—died Jan. 6, 1536, Rome), Sienese architect and painter, one of the earliest artists to attempt illusionist architectural painting (quadratura), the extension of real architecture into imaginary space.
Peruzzi was a contemporary of Raphael and Donato Bramante. He began his career as a painter of frescoes in the Cappella San Giovanni in Siena’s cathedral. His first architectural work was the Villa Farnesina in Rome (1509–21), and he also assisted in the fresco decoration of this palace. On Raphael’s death, in 1520, Peruzzi was appointed one of the architects for St. Peter’s in Rome.
Among the many edifices attributed to Peruzzi, the most significant is probably the Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne (begun 1532) in Rome. To meet the challenge of an unusual site, Peruzzi curved the facade to match the road, organizing the design of the structure for its site rather than according to prevailing principles of central focus and vertical linkages between floors. The atrium was designed with reference to ancient Roman houses, as a reminder of the family’s long Roman heritage. Once a year, on March 16, the palace is open to the public as a commemoration of a miracle performed on that date in 1583 by the priest who became Saint Philip Neri.
