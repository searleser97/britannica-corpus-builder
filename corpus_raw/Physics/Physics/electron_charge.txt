Electron charge,  (symbol e), fundamental physical constant expressing the naturally occurring unit of electric charge, equal to 1.602176634 × 10−19 coulomb. In addition to the electron, all freely existing charged subatomic particles thus far discovered have an electric charge equal to this value or some whole-number multiple of it. Quarks, which are always bound within larger subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons, have charges of 1/3 or  2/3 of this value.
