Boris Borisovich, Prince Golitsyn,  (Prince), Golitsyn also spelled Galitzin,  (born March 2 [Feb. 18, old style], 1862, St. Petersburg, Russiaâ€”died  May 17 [May 4, O.S.], 1916, near Petrograd), Russian physicist known for his work on methods of earthquake observations and on the construction of seismographs.
Golitsyn was educated in the naval school and naval academy. In 1887 he left active service for scientific studies and went to Strasbourg. In 1891 he was appointed Privatdozent at the University of Moscow and in 1893 professor of physics at Dorpat. The same year he was elected fellow, and in 1908 a member, of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. His early research was in spectroscopy.
He invented the first effective electromagnetic seismograph in 1906. Five years later he modified his earlier seismograph to produce an instrument essentially identical to that used today. His valuable seismic interpretations earned Russian seismology international recognition. One of the first to suggest using explosives for studying subsurface structure, he established across Russia a chain of seismic stations that continue in operation.
He received the degree of doctor of science from the University of Manchester in 1910, and in 1911 he was elected president of the International Seismological Association. In 1913 he was appointed director of the Central Physical (later Geophysical) Observatory at St. Petersburg and achieved good results in the organization of meteorological service throughout Russia. His book, Lectures on Seismometry, was published in 1912 and translated into German in 1914.
