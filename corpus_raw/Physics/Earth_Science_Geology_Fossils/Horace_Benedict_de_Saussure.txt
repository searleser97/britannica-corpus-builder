Horace Bénédict de Saussure,  (born Feb. 17, 1740, Geneva, Switz.—died  Jan. 22, 1799, Geneva), Swiss physicist, geologist, and early Alpine explorer who developed an improved hygrometer to measure atmospheric humidity.
Saussure became professor of physics and philosophy at the Academy of Geneva in 1762 and in 1766 developed what was probably the first electrometer, used to measure electric potential. The word geology was introduced into scientific nomenclature by Saussure with the publication of the first volume of his Voyages dans les Alpes (1779–96; “Travels in the Alps”), a work that contains the results of more than 30 years of geologic studies. In 1783 Saussure built the first hygrometer utilizing a human hair to measure humidity. He also performed early laboratory experiments on the origin of granite.
