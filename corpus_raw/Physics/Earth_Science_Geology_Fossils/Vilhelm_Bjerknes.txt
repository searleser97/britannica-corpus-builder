Vilhelm Bjerknes,  (born March 14, 1862, Christiania, Norway—died April 9, 1951, Oslo), Norwegian meteorologist and physicist, one of the founders of the modern science of weather forecasting.
As a youth Bjerknes assisted his father, a professor of mathematics at Christiania, with research in hydrodynamics. In 1890 he went to Germany and became an assistant to and scientific collaborator with the German physicist Heinrich Hertz. Bjerknes made a comprehensive study of electrical resonance that was decisive in the development of radio.
After two years as lecturer at the Högskola (School of Engineering), Stockholm, Bjerknes in 1895 became professor of applied mechanics and mathematical physics at the University of Stockholm. Two years later he discovered the circulation theorems that led him to a synthesis of hydrodynamics and thermodynamics applicable to large-scale motions in the atmosphere and the ocean. This work ultimately resulted in the theory of air masses, which is essential to modern weather forecasting. In 1904 he presented a farsighted program for physical weather prediction. The Carnegie Foundation awarded him an annual stipend (1905–41) to support his research.
In 1907 Bjerknes returned to Norway and accepted a professorship at the university in Kristiania (so spelled from 1877 to 1925). Five years later he became professor of geophysics at the University of Leipzig, where he organized and directed the Leipzig Geophysical Institute. In 1917 he accepted a position with a museum in Bergen, Norway, and there founded the Bergen Geophysical Institute. His most productive years were spent at Bergen; there he wrote On the Dynamics of the Circular Vortex with Applications to the Atmosphere and to Atmospheric Vortex and Wave Motion (1921). Now a classic, this work clearly details the most important aspects of his research. In 1926 he obtained a position with the university in Oslo, where he continued his studies until his retirement in 1932.
