Bubble chamber,  radiation detector that uses as the detecting medium a superheated liquid that boils into tiny bubbles of vapour around the ions produced along the tracks of subatomic particles. The bubble chamber was developed in 1952 by the American physicist Donald A. Glaser.
The device makes use of the way that a liquidâ€™s boiling point increases with pressure. It consists of a pressure-tight vessel containing liquid (often liquid hydrogen) that is maintained under high pressure but below its boiling point at that pressure. When the pressure on the liquid is suddenly reduced, the liquid becomes superheated; in other words, the liquid is above its normal boiling point at the reduced pressure. As charged particles travel through the liquid, tiny bubbles form along the particle tracks. By photographing the bubble trails it is possible to record the particle tracks, and the photographs can be analyzed to make precision measurements of the processes caused by the high-speed particles. Because of the relatively high density of the bubble-chamber liquid (as opposed to vapour-filled cloud chambers), collisions producing rare reactions are more frequent and are observable in fine detail. New collisions can be recorded every few seconds when the chamber is exposed to bursts of high-speed particles from particle accelerators. The bubble chamber proved very useful in the study of high-energy nuclear physics and subatomic particles, particularly during the 1960s.
