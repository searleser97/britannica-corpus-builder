Paolo Frisi,  (born April 13, 1728, Milan, Austrian Habsburg domain [Italy]â€”died  Nov. 22, 1784, Milan), Italian mathematician, astronomer, and physicist who is best known for his work in hydraulics. His most significant contributions to science, however, were in the compilation, interpretation, and dissemination of the work of other scientists.
Frisi was a member of the Barnabite religious order, a professor at the University of Milan, and a member of most of the major scientific societies of his time. He was held in such esteem by his contemporaries that plans for nearly all the major hydraulic works constructed in northern Italy during his adult life were first shown to him for his inspection. His major work on hydraulics, Del modo di regolare i fiumi, e i torrenti (1762; A Treatise on Rivers and Torrents), a summary of the best information in this field, was widely used as an engineering handbook. The commentaries he wrote on the work of such scientists as Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton were influential in bringing their ideas to the attention of a wide audience.
