Franz Maria Ulrich Theodor Hoch Aepinus,  (born Dec. 13, 1724, Rostock, Mecklenburg-Schwerin [Germany]—died Aug. 10, 1802, Dorpat, Russia), physicist who discovered (1756) pyroelectricity in the mineral tourmaline and published (1759) the first mathematical theory of electric and magnetic phenomena.
Aepinus studied medicine and briefly taught mathematics at the University of Rostock, where his father was a professor of theology. In 1755 he became director of the astronomical observatory in Berlin and a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1757 he moved to Russia, where he was appointed a full member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences (now the Russian Academy of Sciences) in St. Petersburg. After retiring in 1798, he settled in Dorpat.
In Tentamen theoriae electricitatis et magnetismi (1759; “An Attempt at a Theory of Electricity and Magnetism”), Aepinus described known electric and magnetic effects on the basis of a mathematical assumption analogous to that of Newton’s law of gravitation—i.e., that attractive and repulsive forces between charges act at a distance and decrease in proportion to the inverse square of the distance between charged bodies. Following and improving on Benjamin Franklin’s theories of electricity, Aepinus assumed that just one electric (and one magnetic) “fluid” is normally present in all material bodies and that the relative abundance or deficiency of fluid is manifested as positive or negative electric charges, respectively.
Aepinus also contributed to the invention of the parallel-plate capacitor, made important improvements in the microscope, and demonstrated the effects of parallax during the transit of Venus across the Sun’s disk in 1764. His later years were devoted to government service at the court of Catherine II of Russia.
