Hydraulic power, also called Fluid Power,  power transmitted by the controlled circulation of pressurized fluid, usually a water-soluble oil or water–glycol mixture, to a motor that converts it into a mechanical output capable of doing work on a load. Hydraulic power systems have greater flexibility than mechanical and electrical systems and can produce more power than such systems of equal size. They also provide rapid and accurate responses to controls. As a result, hydraulic power systems are extensively used in modern aircraft, automobiles, heavy industrial machinery, and many kinds of machine tools.
Motors in a hydraulic power system are commonly classified into two basic types: linear motors and rotational motors. A linear motor, also called a hydraulic cylinder, consists of a piston and a cylindrical outer casing. The piston constitutes the mechanical interface across which kinetic energy from the fluid is transferred to the motor mechanism. A piston rod serves to couple the mechanical force generated inside the cylinder to the external load. Hydraulic linear motors are useful for applications that require a high-force, straight-line motion and so are utilized as brake cylinders in automobiles, control actuators on aircraft, and in devices that inject molten metal into die-casting machines. A rotational motor, sometimes called a rotary hydraulic motor, produces a rotary motion. In such a motor the pressurized fluid supplied by a hydraulic pump acts on the surfaces of the motor’s gear teeth, vanes, or pistons and creates a force that produces a torque on the output shaft. Rotational motors are most often used in digging equipment (e.g., earth augers), printing presses, and spindle drives on machine tools.
