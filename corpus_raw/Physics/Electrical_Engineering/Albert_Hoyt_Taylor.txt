Albert Hoyt Taylor,  (born January 1, 1874, Chicago, Illinois, United States—died December 11, 1961, Claremont, California), American physicist and radio engineer whose work underlay the development of radar in the United States.
Taylor was trained at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, and the University of Göttingen, Germany. He taught at Michigan State College in East Lansing and at the universities of Wisconsin at Madison and North Dakota at Grand Forks. He was superintendent of the radio division of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory from 1923 until 1945.
Taylor’s studies in electromagnetic radiation concentrated on shortwaves, examining their polarization and refraction; his research confirmed the Heaviside “radio roof” theory in 1925. His work in the 1920s and ’30s on radio echoes and the upper atmosphere contributed to the development of radar. Throughout the 1930s, Taylor persisted in pursuing the development of radar, in spite of low priority, low funding, and lack of support by the U.S. Navy administration in Washington. Without Taylor’s persistence and wise leadership at the Naval Research Laboratory it is doubtful that the United States would have had operational radar in time for World War II. The dedicated effort by Taylor and those under his supervision allowed the U.S. Navy to have a decided advantage over the Japanese Navy, whose radar capabilities were considerably less advanced.
