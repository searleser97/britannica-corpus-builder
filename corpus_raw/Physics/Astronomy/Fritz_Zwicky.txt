Fritz Zwicky,  (born February 14, 1898, Varna, Bulgaria—died February 8, 1974, Pasadena, California, U.S.), Swiss astronomer and physicist who made valuable contributions to the theory and understanding of supernovas (stars that for a short time are far brighter than normal).
Zwicky received a doctorate in physics (1922) from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zürich, and served on the faculty of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, from 1925 to 1972.
During the early 1930s Zwicky contributed substantially to the physics of the solid state, gaseous ionization, and thermodynamics but soon turned to the study of supernovas, novas, and cosmic rays. In 1933 he discovered the existence of dark matter. In 1934, in collaboration with Walter Baade, he proposed that supernovas are a class of stellar explosion completely different from the ordinary novas and occur less often (two or three times every 1,000 years in the Milky Way Galaxy). Zwicky began conducting an extensive search of neighbouring galaxies for supernovas, and from 1937 to 1941 he discovered 18 of them. Only about 12 had been recorded previously in the history of astronomy.
As director of research (1943–46) of the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, Azusa, California, and technical adviser thereafter, he developed some of the earliest jet engines, including the JATO (jet assisted takeoff) units used to launch heavy-laden aircraft from short runways.
