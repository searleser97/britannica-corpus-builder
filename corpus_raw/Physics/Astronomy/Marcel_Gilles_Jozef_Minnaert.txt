Marcel Gilles Jozef Minnaert,  (born Feb. 12, 1893, Bruges, Belg.—died Oct. 26, 1970, Utrecht, Neth.), Flemish astronomer and solar physicist who pioneered in solar spectrophotometry and showed how such a technique could reveal much about the structure of the Sun’s outer layers.
Minnaert was first a botanist, but his desire to understand more fully the effect of light on plants led him to study physics at the University of Leiden, in the Netherlands. Exiled from Belgium for his support of the nationalist Flemish movement before and during World War I, he became a staff member of the solar observatory at Utrecht in 1921.
After the invention of the microphotometer about 1920, Minnaert undertook the measurement of the intensities of dark lines in the solar spectrum. With the help of two pupils, he prepared the monumental Utrecht Photometric Atlas of the Solar Spectrum (1940), still a standard reference, which includes measurements of the absorption lines from 3332 angstroms to 8771 angstroms. Other works on the Sun’s spectrum followed. Perhaps his most noted work is Die Natuurkunde van’t Vrije Veld, 3 vol. (1937–42; Eng. trans. of vol. 1, Light and Color in the Open Air, 1954), on optical phenomena associated with meteorology.
From 1937 until his retirement in 1963 Minnaert was director of the Sonnenborgh Observatory at Utrecht, but during most of World War II he was interned in a Nazi concentration camp.
