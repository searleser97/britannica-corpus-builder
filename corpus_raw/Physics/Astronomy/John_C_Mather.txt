John C. Mather,  (born 1946, Roanoke, Virginia, U.S.), American physicist, who was corecipient, with George F. Smoot, of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physics for discoveries supporting the big-bang model.
Mather studied physics at Swarthmore University (B.S., 1968) and the University of California at Berkeley (Ph.D., 1974). He later joined the staff of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center, serving as a senior astrophysicist.
In the 1980s Mather and Smoot were instrumental in developing the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) for NASA. The satellite was launched in 1989 and measured cosmic microwave background radiation formed during the early phases of creation of the universe. The resulting data supports the hypothesis that the universe emerged from a state of high temperature and densityâ€”the so-called big bang that occurred at least 10 billion years ago.
