Phog Allen, byname of Forrest Clare Allen,  (born Nov. 15, 1885, Jamesport, Mo., U.S.—died Sept. 16, 1974, Lawrence, Kan.), American college basketball coach who is regarded as the first great basketball coach. He was also instrumental in making basketball an Olympic sport.
From 1905 to 1907 at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Allen played for James Naismith, who invented basketball. Allen coached the team during his final two years on campus (1907–09). After graduating he pursued a degree in osteopathic medicine and later gained a national reputation for his skillful treatment of athletic injuries. After stints as a baseball umpire (during which he earned his nickname because of his foghorn voice) and as a coach of all sports at Warrensburg Teacher’s College (now Central Missouri State University), Allen returned to the University of Kansas in 1920 as athletic director, football coach, and basketball coach.
Allen’s Kansas Jayhawk basketball teams of 1920–56 won 771 games and lost 233; his 1951–52 team won the championship of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. In 1936 the Helms Foundation retroactively awarded the 1922 and 1923 national championships to Allen’s Jayhawks. His teams won 24 Big Eight Conference championships (known as the Big Six Conference from 1929 to 1947 and now known as the Big 12). He retired as the winningest coach in college basketball.
Regarded as the “father of basketball coaching,” Allen played a key role in establishing the National Association of Basketball Coaches in 1927 and developed the talents of many successful coaches, including Adolph Rupp, Dutch Lonborg, and Dean Smith. He was instrumental in adding basketball to the Olympic Games program in 1936, and in 1952 he coached the American team that won the Olympic gold medal in Helsinki. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959. The University of Kansas Jayhawks have played basketball at the Forrest C. “Phog” Allen Fieldhouse since 1955.
