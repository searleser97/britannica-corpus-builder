Bob Pettit, byname of Robert E. Lee Pettit, Jr.,  (born December 12, 1932, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, U.S.), American professional basketball player, the first to score 20,000 points in the National Basketball Association (NBA). A clumsy player in high school, Pettit turned himself into a graceful 6-foot 9-inch (2.06-metre) athlete, and today he is considered to be the first really agile player of exceptional height in professional basketball.
After getting cut from his high school basketball team as both a freshman and a sophomore, Pettit began a single-minded practice regimen that resulted in his playing a starring role in his high school’s state title win during his senior year. He attended Louisiana State University in his hometown of Baton Rouge, where he was a two-time consensus All-American (1953, 1954). In 1953 he led the Tigers to a berth in the Final Four (national championship semifinals). Pettit was selected by the Milwaukee Hawks with the second overall pick of the 1954 NBA draft.
As one of the sport’s first “big men” with the skills to play away from the basket, Pettit made an immediate impact in the professional ranks, earning Rookie of the Year and first-team All-NBA honours in his initial season in the league. In each season but his last, he led the Hawks (who moved to St. Louis in 1955) in scoring and rebounding. Twice (during the 1955–56 and 1958–59 seasons) he was the NBA scoring champion and was voted the league’s Most Valuable Player. Pettit led the Hawks to four berths in the NBA finals (1957, 1958, 1960, and 1961) and to their first NBA championship (1958). In the deciding sixth game of the 1958 finals, he scored a then postseason-record 50 points in a defeat of the Boston Celtics to clinch the title for the Hawks.
In 792 NBA regular season games, Pettit scored 20,880 points (an average of 26.4 points a game) and captured 12,851 rebounds, both of which were NBA records at the time of Pettit’s retirement in 1965. During his 11-year career, he garnered 10 All-NBA first team selections and was named to 11 All-Star Games. Pettit was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1970 and was named one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history in 1996.
