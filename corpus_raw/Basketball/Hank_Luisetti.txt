Hank Luisetti, byname of Angelo Enrico Luisetti,  (born June 16, 1916, San Francisco, Calif., U.S.â€”died Dec. 17, 2002, San Mateo, Calif.), American collegiate basketball player who revolutionized the sport by introducing the one-handed shot.
Luisetti honed his running one-handed shot (technically not a jump shot, as he kept his feet on the ground) on the playgrounds of his native San Francisco. The 6-foot 2-inch (1.88-metre) Luisetti played at Stanford University from 1935 to 1938. When his one-handed shot debuted on the national stage at a highly publicized 1936 game in Madison Square Garden, it was met with skepticism by the basketball establishment. Over time, however, it grew in popularity and eventually led to the replacement of the static game of two-handed set shots with more scoring and action. Luisetti was also innovative in his dribbling and behind-the-back passing.
A three time All-American, Luisetti was the first collegiate player to score 50 points in a game; his career total points were 1,596 in four years. His team won three Pacific Conference championships and popularized the fast-break offense and a combination of man-to-man and zone defense. After his collegiate career ended, he was a member of a number of nationally known amateur teams, but he never played professionally. Luisetti was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959.
