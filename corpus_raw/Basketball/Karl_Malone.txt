Karl Malone, in full Karl Anthony Malone, byname the Mailman,  (born July 24, 1963, Summerfield, Louisiana, U.S.), American basketball player who owns the National Basketball Association (NBA) career record for free throws attempted (13,188) and made (9,787). He ranks second in career points scored (36,928), field goals made (13,528), and minutes played (54,852). In 1996 Malone, known as the “Mailman” because he always “delivered,” was named one of the NBA’s 50 all-time greatest players.
After a successful collegiate career at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Malone entered the NBA in 1985 as a first-round draft pick of the Utah Jazz. Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 metres) tall and weighing 260 pounds (117.5 kg), the muscular player quickly established himself as the dominant power forward in the league. He and point guard John Stockton ran the pick-and-roll play to perfection, with Stockton piling up assists and Malone piling up points. Widely celebrated for his intense workout regimens and his durability—he never missed more than two games in any of his 18 seasons with Utah—Malone was a tenacious rebounder who could score both by muscling in shots in the low post as well as via his efficient mid-range jump shot.
Malone helped the Jazz reach the play-offs in each of his seasons with the team. While the Jazz failed to win a championship during his career, Malone did lead the team into the NBA finals in 1998 and 1999, losing to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls each time. He was named to the All-NBA first team 11 times and won gold medals at the Olympics in 1992 and 1996. He was twice named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (1997, 1999).
In 2003 Malone left the Jazz and played his final season (2003–04) with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping them reach the NBA finals (a loss to the Detroit Pistons). He became the director of basketball promotions and the assistant strength-and-conditioning coach at Louisiana Tech in 2007. Malone joined the Jazz as a coach for the team’s post players in 2013. In 2010 Malone was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
