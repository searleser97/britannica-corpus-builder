Sacramento Kings,  American professional basketball team based in Sacramento, California, that plays in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The franchise won an NBA championship in 1951 when it was known as the Rochester Royals of New York.
The Royals franchise was founded in 1945 in Rochester as a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). An instant success, the team won the NBL title in its first season in the league (1945–46) and reached the NBL finals in each of the following two years. It joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) for the 1948–49 season and moved to the NBA before the next season when that league was formed from the merger of the BAA and the NBL. In 1950–51 the Royals, led by three future Hall of Famers—guards Bob Davies and Bobby Wanzer and centre-forward Arnie Risen—won the NBA championship by defeating the New York Knicks in a seven-game series. While this strong group of players did not win another title, the Royals were one of the best teams of the early NBA, reaching the division finals (akin to the modern NBA’s conference finals) three times between 1949–50 and 1953–54.
The 1954–55 season saw the Royals post the first losing record in franchise history, and the team finished the remaining seasons of the decade below .500 as the aging members of the Royals roster were replaced by young stars such as forwards Jack Twyman and Maurice Stokes (whose enduring friendship, especially after Stokes became disabled, is one of professional sport’s most engaging stories). As the NBA continued to grow through the 1950s, the Royals relocated to the much larger city of Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1957, adding centre-forward Wayne Embry to the roster the next year.
In 1960 the Royals acquired the University of Cincinnati’s star guard Oscar Robertson as a territorial pick (from 1947 to 1965 the NBA allowed teams to forfeit their first-round draft choice to select, prior to the regular draft, a college player from the immediate area). Led by the “Big O,” the Royals made two consecutive trips to the division finals in 1962–63 and 1963–64, losing to the eventual-champion Boston Celtics on each occasion. Despite the addition in 1963 of forward Jerry Lucas—like Robertson, a territorial pick (from Ohio State) and a future Hall of Famer—the team failed to advance out of the first round of the play-offs in its three other postseason berths in the 1960s.
Coached by Bob Cousy (1969–73), the struggling Royals were sold to a group of businessmen based in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1971. After playing one final season in Cincinnati, the franchise was relocated to Kansas City before the 1972–73 season and renamed the Kings because the city’s Major League Baseball team had already claimed the name Royals. In its first three seasons after the move, the team divided its home games between Kansas City and Omaha, Nebraska, and was known as the Kansas City–Omaha Kings over this period. Although it featured the on-court heroics of all-star guard Nate (“Tiny”) Archibald at the beginning of its 13-season tenure in Kansas City, the team was mostly mediocre during this period, qualifying for the play-offs five times and advancing past its first play-off series just once, a surprising run to the 1981 conference finals after a 40–42 regular season. In 1983 the Kings were again sold to an out-of-state ownership group, and, after playing two lame-duck seasons in Kansas City, the franchise moved to Sacramento in 1985.
The Kings had a losing record in each of their first 13 years in Sacramento—finishing in last or second-to-last place 10 times during that stretch—despite the strong play of all-star shooting guard Mitch Richmond for much of the 1990s. The franchise’s fortunes began to turn in 1998–99, as the Kings qualified for the first of eight consecutive postseason appearances. The high point of this streak came in 2001–02, when the team, led by forwards Chris Webber and Peja Stojakovic, had the best record in the NBA and reached the Western Conference finals, which it lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in an exciting seven-game series. Since 2006–07 Sacramento has failed to return to the play-offs, and the team became known more for managerial and off-court dysfunction than it was for its on-court play in the following years.
