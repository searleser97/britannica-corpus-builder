Bob Cousy, byname of Robert Joseph Cousy,  (born August 9, 1928, New York, New York, U.S.), American basketball player and coach, who was one of the greatest ball-handling guards in the National Basketball Association (NBA), expert both at scoring and at playmaking.
Cousy played collegiate basketball at the College of the Holy Cross (Worcester, Massachusetts; 1949–50), where he was an All-American. He joined the Boston Celtics in 1950 and eventually teamed with talented players such as Bill Russell, Bill Sharman, and K.C. Jones. Cousy adopted the competitive spirit of his coach Red Auerbach and directed the Celtics’ play in six championship seasons (1957, 1959–63). Known as “Houdini of the Hardwood,” he dazzled fans with his dribbling skill and behind-the-back passes. The flashiness of his play, however, was not without substance. Cousy led the NBA in assists from 1953 to 1960, his one-game record of 28 (1959) standing until 1978.
After he left the Celtics in 1963, Cousy coached at Boston College (1963–69), where he guided the team to five postseason tournaments. He returned to professional basketball in 1969 as head coach of the Cincinnati Royals (and played in seven games that season). Cousy coached the team (which became the Kansas City–Omaha Kings in 1972) until November 1973. From 1975 to 1979 he served as commissioner of the American Soccer League and later became a marketing consultant and part-time television commentator for the Celtics. In 1996 the NBA named him one of the 50 greatest players of all time. Cousy was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1970. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019.
