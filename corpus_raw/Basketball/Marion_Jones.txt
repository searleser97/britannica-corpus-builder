Marion Jones,  (born October 12, 1975, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), American athlete, who, at the 2000 Olympic Games, became the first woman to win five track-and-field medals at a single Olympics. In 2007, however, she admitted to having used banned substances and subsequently returned the medals.
Jones early displayed talent on the track, and her family moved several times during her adolescence so that she could compete on prominent junior-high and high-school teams. By the time she was 12, Jones had begun competing internationally. She was also an accomplished high-school basketball player, winning California’s Division I Player of the Year award in 1993. She attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on a basketball scholarship, and in 1994 she helped the women’s basketball team win the national title. Jones decided to sit out the 1995–96 basketball season in order to focus on track and on the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. A series of foot injuries, however, prevented her from trying out for the U.S. Olympic team. She then returned to basketball, and in 1997 she was named the Most Valuable Player of the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament.
After graduating in 1997, Jones concentrated on track. At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, she won gold medals in the 100 metres (10.75 sec) and the 200 metres (21.84 sec) and as a member of the 4 × 400-metre relay team (3 min 22.62 sec); she also claimed bronze medals in the long jump and the 4 × 100-metre relay. At the 2001 world championships, Jones won gold medals in the 200 metres and the 4 × 100-metre relay, and she went undefeated during the 2002 season. She took much of 2003 off because of the birth of her son. She returned to athletics in 2004 but was not up to her previous form. At the Olympic Games in Athens that year, she managed only a fifth-place finish in the long jump.
Through much of her career, Jones was suspected of using steroids. In 2003 a federal investigation into illegal steroid distribution by the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) led to allegations by BALCO founder Victor Conte and Jones’s ex-husband, C.J. Hunter, that the sprinter used banned substances. Jones, who had never failed a drug test up to that time, denied the allegations. In 2006 she tested positive for a banned substance but was later cleared by a follow-up test. The following year, however, she pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about her drug use and admitted to having taken steroids. In November 2007 track and field’s international governing body—the International Association of Athletics Federations—annulled all of Jones’s results from September 2000 on, including her Olympic titles. The International Olympic Committee officially stripped Jones of her five medals from the Sydney Games the following month. In January 2008 she was sentenced to six months in prison for providing false statements to federal investigators about her steroid use and for her involvement in a check-fraud scheme.
In an attempt to revive her long-dormant basketball career, Jones signed with the Tulsa Shock of the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) in 2010 but was cut 15 games into the 2011 WNBA season.
