Adolph Rupp, in full Adolph Frederick Rupp, byname the Baron of Bluegrass Country,  (born September 2, 1901, Halstead, Kansas, U.S.—died December 10, 1977, Lexington, Kentucky), American collegiate basketball coach at the University of Kentucky (1930–72). He retired as the most successful coach in collegiate basketball, with 876 wins (surpassed in 1997 by Dean Smith). Rupp’s teams won more than 82 percent of their games.
Rupp grew up on a Kansas farm and was hardly aware of basketball until he went to college. He was a member of the University of Kansas Big Eight Conference championship team of 1923. After graduating from Kansas in 1923, he coached for several years at Iowa and Illinois high schools. In 1930 Rupp became coach at the University of Kentucky, where he remained until retirement in 1972. During his career, Kentucky won 27 Southeastern Conference titles, 4 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships (1948–49, 1951, 1958), and 1 National Invitation Tournament (1946). He was also co-coach of the U.S. Olympic team that won the gold medal in the 1948 games.
Rupp was outspoken and a strict disciplinarian; he taught set offenses and aggressive man-to-man defenses that cut off opponents from the lanes to the basket. He was named coach of the year four times and coached more than 25 players who became professionals. In addition, he served on the NCAA rules committee from 1961. After his forced retirement as coach (he had reached the mandatory retirement age of 70), he served as president of the professional Memphis Tams in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and as the vice chairman of the board of directors of the ABA’s Kentucky Colonels. Rupp was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969. Throughout his life in Kentucky he engaged in cattle breeding and tobacco farming.
