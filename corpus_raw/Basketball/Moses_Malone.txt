Moses Malone, in full Moses Eugene Malone,  (born March 23, 1955, Petersburg, Virginia, U.S.—died September 13, 2015, Norfolk, Virginia), American professional basketball player who was the dominating centre and premier offensive rebounder in the National Basketball Association (NBA) during the 1980s. He led the Philadelphia 76ers to a championship in 1983.
Malone, who led Petersburg High School to 50 consecutive victories and two state championships, was one of the most sought-after college basketball prospects in history. He chose to bypass college, however, and sign with the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1974, thereby becoming the first player to enter professional basketball directly from high school. After the ABA dissolved in 1976, he was acquired by the NBA’s Buffalo Braves, who traded him to the Houston Rockets two games into the 1976–77 season.
Quick and tenacious, Malone, who stood 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 metres), was noted for his all-around play. An outstanding offensive rebounder with an accurate shooting eye from the floor and free-throw line, he was named the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1979 and 1982. In 1981 he led the Rockets to the NBA finals. He signed with the Philadelphia 76ers in 1982, teaming with Julius Erving, and the following year the team won the NBA championship. Malone was named MVP of the championship series and of the league in 1983. For six of the seven seasons from 1978 to 1985, he led the NBA in rebounds.
Malone was a member of eight NBA teams, including the Washington Bullets and the Atlanta Hawks. During his 19 years in the league, he set records for most free throws made (8,531; since broken by Karl Malone) and most offensive rebounds (6,731). He retired in 1995, having scored 27,409 points and collected 16,212 rebounds, which ranked him among the NBA’s all-time top 10 in both categories. A 13-time All-Star (1975, 1978–89), he also averaged 20.6 points and 12.2 rebounds per game. In 1997 the NBA named him one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history, and in 2001 he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
