Cooper Hewitt, in full Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, formerly Cooper Union Museum for the Arts of Decoration (1896–1968), Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design (1968–69), Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design (1969–1994), Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum (1994–2014),  museum in New York, New York, noted for its holdings centred on historical and contemporary design.
The Cooper Hewitt was originally founded in 1896 by the granddaughters of American industrialist Peter Cooper and opened to the public the following year. In 1968 it became part of the Smithsonian Institution. The museum is located in the Carnegie Mansion on New York City’s Fifth Avenue. The 64-room mansion, a national landmark, is itself an example of design innovation, having been the first American home to have a steel frame and central heating. The Cooper Hewitt was the first—and for many years the only—American museum dedicated solely to design. Its library is also renowned.
The Cooper Hewitt’s permanent collection consists of more than 210,000 pieces, including both one-of-a-kind pieces and mass-produced objects. The museum is organized into six curatorial departments: archives; product design and decorative arts; drawings, prints, and graphic design; textiles; wall coverings; and digital. Among the collection’s objects are a Michelangelo drawing of a candelabrum, furniture plans by Frank Lloyd Wright, and more than 400 textile stencil patterns. Also present are drawings and prints by artists such as Winslow Homer and Frederic E. Church. The product design and decorative art collection contains some 40,000 three-dimensional objects, with examples from ancient times to the 21st century. The collections of textiles and wall coverings are also extensive. The Cooper Hewitt annually presents a group of design awards.
