Du Pont Family,   French-descended American family whose fortune was founded on explosive powders and textiles and who diversified later into other areas of manufacturing. Pierre-Samuel du Pont (q.v.), born in Paris, was one of the main writers of the physiocratic school of economics. His sons founded the two branches of the du Pont family.
The first son, Victor-Marie du Pont (1767–1827), was attaché to the first French legation to the United States (1787), aide-de-camp to Lafayette (1789–91), second secretary of the French legation (1791–92), and first secretary (1795–96). In 1800 he returned to settle in the United States and became naturalized. When his attempts in New York at a mercantile importing business (1802–05) and then a land development project (1806–09) both failed, he went south to manage his brother Irénée’s woolen mills in Wilmington, Del., but was largely ineffectual in this too. He was later a director of the Bank of the United States, Philadelphia. His son, Samuel Francis du Pont (1803–65), was a U.S. naval officer. He served in the Mexican War, was on the board that designed the curriculum for the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., and commanded squadrons and fleets in the blockade of the South during the American Civil War, rising to the rank of rear admiral. A naval attack that he led on the defenses of Charleston, S.C., in 1863, however, met a crushing defeat, and he was relieved of command; he retired from active duty.
The other son of Pierre-Samuel, Eleuthère-Irénée du Pont (1771–1834), had worked at the French royal powder works before arriving in America in 1800. Impressed by the poor quality and high price of American powder, he made further studies and eventually in 1802 established a gunpowder plant near Wilmington, Del., that became highly profitable, especially during the War of 1812, and that marked the successful beginning of the E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (the name that he chose in 1833). He also established a woolen mill and pursued farming as an avocation. His immediate successors were two sons, Alfred Victor du Pont (1798–1856), who headed the company from 1834 to 1850 in a traditional manner, and Henry du Pont (1812–89), who proved more vigorously enterprising. Though a graduate of West Point (1833), Henry left the army a year later and joined the family business, heading the company during the great period from 1850 to 1889 and expanding its activities especially after the Civil War; he acquired powder works as far away as California and gained control of various associated enterprises. In the course of this time he was in partnership with other members of the family. One of his sons, Henry Algernon du Pont (1838–1926), was a graduate of West Point and a Medal of Honor winner in the Civil War; he entered the family business in 1878 and pushed for its incorporation in 1899. Retiring in 1902, he was U.S. senator from Delaware from 1906 to 1917. In 1902, three cousins—Thomas Coleman du Pont (1863–1930), Alfred Irénée du Pont (1864–1935), and Pierre Samuel du Pont (1870–1954)—became chief directors, assuring that direction of the corporation would remain in the family.
