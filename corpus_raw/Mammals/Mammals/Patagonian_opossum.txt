Patagonian opossum,  (Lestodelphys halli),  a small insectivorous and carnivorous marsupial (family Didelphidae, subfamily Didelphinae) found only in south-central Argentina, occurring farther south than other American marsupials. Adults reach 24.5 cm (10 inches) in length and weigh up to 90 grams (3.2 ounces). The face is gray with pale cheeks and a black ring around the eye. The dense fur of the body is dark gray on the upper surfaces, pale gray on the sides, and white on the underparts. The claws are long and extend beyond the toes. The tail is furred at the base, covered in short hair to the tip, and is shorter than the head and body; it can become greatly thickened with stored fat. Females lack a pouch. The diet includes insects and small vertebrates, mainly birds and mice, which it consumes including fur and bones. These opossums hibernate during the coldest days of the year.
