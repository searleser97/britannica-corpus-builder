red panda,  (Ailurus fulgens), also called lesser panda, panda, red cat-bear, or red bear-cat,  reddish brown, long-tailed, raccoonlike mammal, about the size of a large domestic cat, that is found in the mountain forests of the Himalayas and adjacent areas of eastern Asia and subsists mainly on bamboo and other vegetation, fruits, and insects. Once classified as a relative of the giant panda, it is now usually classified as the sole member of the family Ailuridae.
The red panda has soft thick fur—rich reddish brown above and black underneath. The face is white, with a stripe of red-brown from each eye to the corners of the mouth, and the bushy tail is faintly ringed. The head and body length of the red panda is 50–65 cm (20–26 inches) and the tail 30–50 cm (12–20 inches) long, and the weight ranges from 3 to 6.2 kg (6.5 to 14 pounds). The feet have hairy soles, and the claws are semi-retractile.
Red pandas are made up of two subspecies—the Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens fulgens), which resides in the mountains of northern India, Tibet, Bhutan, and Nepal, and the Chinese red panda (A. fulgens styani), which lives in China’s Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Although these mammals are classified traditionally within a single species, some scientists claim that DNA and morphological differences between the two are striking enough to reclassify them as two distinct species called A. fulgens and A. styani.
The red panda lives high in the mountains among rocks and trees and climbs with agility (though its tail is not prehensile). It seems to do most of its feeding on the ground. It is nocturnal and may live alone, in pairs, or in family groups. The litters generally contain one or two young that are born in spring after a gestation period of about 130 days. The animal is gentle and easily tamed but usually resents being handled. It is a very popular zoo animal and is frequently involved in the animal trade.
