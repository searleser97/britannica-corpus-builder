Criollo,  horse breed of Argentina, Brazil, and other South American countries, used as a stock and riding horse. The breed was developed from horses that had been imported from Spain and allowed to run wild in Argentina for 300 years. In 1920 a herd of wild horses was gathered and a breeding program begun. Selective breeding has added style and refinement to the very hardy Criollos. The size is small, from 13.2 to 14.3 hands (about 54 to 59 inches, or 137 to 150 centimetres) tall; most colours are found, but dun, palomino, and sorrel are preferred. See also pony.
