Weimaraner,  sporting dog breed developed in the early 19th century by German nobles of the court of Weimar. First used to hunt big game, the dog was later trained as a bird dog and retriever. The Weimaraner is a graceful dog with hanging ears, blue, gray, or amber eyes, and a distinctive short, sleek, mouse-gray or silver-gray coat. It stands 23 to 27 inches (58 to 68.5 cm) and weighs 70 to 85 pounds (32 to 39 kg). It is characterized by an alert, well-balanced stance and is valued as an aggressive hunter, good companion, and watchdog. The breed became well known beginning in the 1970s through the whimsical photographs and videos of William Wegman.
