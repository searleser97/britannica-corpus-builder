American Staffordshire Terrier,  breed of dog, originally called Staffordshire Terrier when registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1936, that was developed in the United States and based on the smaller British Staffordshire Bull Terrier.
The ancestry of the American Staffordshire Terrier, or “Staffie” as it is sometimes known, includes breeds such as bulldogs and mastiffs used for bearbaiting (that is, the setting of dogs on a bear or a bull chained to a stake) and dogfighting.
In the United States the American Staffordshire Terrier was bred for a stable temperament and adapted for hunting rodents and other vermin and game and for farm work, taking advantage of the breed’s strength and courage. Over time, larger dogs became the norm. American Staffordshire Terriers reached a peak of popularity in the first half of the 20th century; “Pete the Pup” appeared in the Our Gang comedies, and the breed personified the all-American pet.
The American Staffordshire Terrier is strong, muscular, and stocky, with a broad head and full cheeks. Its “rose” ears (in which the top folds over and back) are sometimes cropped short. It stands 43 to 48 cm (17 to 19 inches) tall and weighs roughly 23 to 36 kg (50 to 80 pounds). Its stiff glossy coat may occur in any colour, with or without patches of contrasting colour, and many dogs have some white on the head, throat, and chest. The American Staffordshire Terrier is affectionate, loyal, and good with children, making it an outstanding family pet. Many authorities note, however, that the breed possesses some level of aggression, especially toward other animals, and they also note that properly bred and socialized dogs do not display innate aggression against humans.
Authorities differ on whether the American Staffordshire Terrier and the pit bull are the same breed. The AKC and the Continental Kennel Club separate them, whereas the United Kennel Club combines both within the American Pit Bull Terrier breed.
