Fringe-lipped bat,  (Trachops cirrhosus), also called frog-eating bat,  a species of bat characterized by the fleshy tubercules that cover its chin. The fringe-lipped bat is widespread in tropical lowland forests of Central and South America. It has large feet with robust claws, a well-developed membrane between its legs, and large ears. Considered medium-sized, it attains a maximum length of about 10 cm (4 inches) and a maximum weight of 45 grams (1.6 ounces). The brownish fur is woolly and rather coarse. The bat’s call is similar to that of the nonpredatory Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis). The fringe-lipped bat can discriminate poisonous from nonpoisonous frogs by their species-specific calls. It is also presumed that the fleshy tubercules on the bat’s chin allow perception of chemicals in the frog’s skin.
Although the fringe-lipped bat is best known for its frog-eating habits, its diet frequently includes large quantities of insects and small vertebrates such as lizards. To find food, fringe-lipped bats fly continuously up and down ravines or in circles over ponds, listening for the mating calls of male frogs and katydids. After detecting potential prey, the bat approaches, covering the site with its wings and tail membrane. Using its head to search for the prey under its wings, the bat immobilizes the prey with a bite and, holding the victim in its mouth, flies to a feeding perch.
The fringe-lipped bat is classified as a leaf-nosed bat (family Phyllostomatidae), a very large family that also includes the fishing bat (see bulldog bat).
