Dartmoor,   breed of pony about 12 hands (48 inches, or 122 cm) tall, hardy, and semiwild in its native Dartmoor, Devon, Eng. It is one of nine horse breeds native to the British Isles, and it is exported.
The Dartmoor pony is considered to be a superior riding pony for children and an excellent foundation stock for the breeding of larger ponies as well. Dartmoors varied widely in size and coloration from early days; with the foundation of the Dartmoor Pony Society, the horse became subject to a set of standards, and the preferred colours are brown, black, and bay.
The name is also given to a breed of long-wooled, hornless English sheep.
