Murray Grey,   breed of Australian beef cattle first bred in 1905 in the Murray River valley on the border between New South Wales and Victoria. Its characteristic colour is grey, and the breed is known for its calving and milking ability, its gentle temperament, and its rapid natural growth rate. Murray Greys are naturally polled (hornless) and have proved adaptable (in part because of their dark skin pigmentation) to a number of climates. The breed has also been successfully crossed with Herefords, Bos Indicus, Shorthorns, Angus, Holstein-Friesians, and other breeds. Murray Greys have been exported to New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Japan. The Murray Grey Beef Cattle Society was founded in 1962.
