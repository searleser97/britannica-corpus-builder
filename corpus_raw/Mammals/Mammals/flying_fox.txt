flying fox,  (genus Pteropus), also called fox bat,  any of about 65 bat species found on tropical islands from Madagascar to Australia and Indonesia and mainland Asia. They are the largest bats; some attain a wingspan of 1.5 metres (5 feet), with a head and body length of about 40 cm (16 inches).
Flying foxes are Old World fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) that roost in large numbers and eat fruit. They are therefore a potential pest and cannot be imported into the United States. Like nearly all Old World fruit bats, flying foxes use sight rather than echolocation to navigate.
