Crest-tailed marsupial rat, also called Kowari,   (Dasyuroides byrnei), rare ratlike mammal of the family Dasyuridae (order Marsupialia), native to the desert and grasslands of central Australia. It averages about 17.5 cm (7 inches) in length, with about a 13.5-centimetre (5-inch) tail. The soft dense fur is a light gray, but the distal portion of the tail is crested above and below with long black hairs. The marsupial rat is nocturnal and entirely terrestrial, living in holes in the ground. Like all dasyurids, it is highly carnivorous.
