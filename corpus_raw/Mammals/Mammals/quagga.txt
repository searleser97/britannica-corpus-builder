Quagga,  (subspecies  Equus quagga quagga),  subspecies of plains zebra (Equus quagga) formerly found in vast herds on the great plains of South Africa but now extinct. The colour of the head, neck, and upper parts of the body was reddish brown, irregularly banded, and marked with dark brown stripes, stronger on the head and neck and gradually becoming fainter until lost behind the shoulder. There was a broad dark median dorsal stripe. The undersurface of the body, the legs, and the tail were nearly white, without stripes. The crest was high, surmounted by a standing mane, banded brown and white. The last known surviving quagga died in the London Zoo in 1872.
