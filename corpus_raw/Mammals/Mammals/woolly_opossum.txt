Woolly opossum,  (subfamily Caluromyinae),  any of five species of arboreal New World marsupials (family Didelphidae). Woolly opossums include the black-shouldered opossum (Caluromysiops irrupta), the bushy-tailed opossum (Glironia venusta), and three species of true woolly opossums (genus Caluromys). The black-shouldered opossum is found only in southeastern Peru and adjacent Brazil. The bushy-tailed opossum is rare, known from only 25 specimens and a few records based on photographs from widely scattered localities in the Amazon region of South America. Derbyâ€™s woolly opossum (Caluromys derbianus) is found in Mexico, in Central America, and along the Pacific slope of Colombia and Ecuador. The brown-eared woolly opossum (Caluromys lanatus) occurs from Colombia and Venezuela to Paraguay. The bare-tailed woolly opossum (Caluromys philander) occurs throughout northern and eastern South America. All have large, nearly naked ears, a long prehensile tail, and either a median stripe on the face or bold markings on the back. The tail is not well furred in the bare-tailed woolly opossum, but in the other species it is extensively furred, often to the tip. All but the bushy-tailed opossum have a pouch.
Solitary and nocturnal, these are the most arboreal American opossums. Foods include fruit, flowers, insects, eggs, birds, and other small animals. True woolly opossums have up to seven young in a litter. They also have the longest life spans of all American opossums; one bare-tailed woolly opossum lived 6 years 4 months in captivity.
