Royal antelope,  (Neotragus pygmaeus),  a hare-sized denizen of West Africa’s lowland rainforest that is the world’s smallest antelope. The similar dwarf antelope (Neotragus batesi) is only slightly bigger. Both belong to the Neotragini tribe of dwarf antelopes that includes the dik-dik, steenbok, klipspringer, and oribi.
The royal antelope has many physical similarities to the hare; it has overdeveloped hindquarters and hind legs nearly twice as long as its forelimbs, a short tail, big eyes, and transparent but small ears. It stands about 25 cm (10 inches) and weighs 2.5–3 kg (5.5–7 pounds). Females are slightly larger than males, which have short (2.5–3 cm [1–1.2 inch]) but sharp back-slanted spikes for horns. The coat colour is red- or golden-brown with a rufous collar and white underparts, chin, and undertail.
Confined to the rainforest and adjacent forest-savanna mosaic that stretches from Ghana to Sierra Leone, the royal antelope inhabits dense vegetation that grows where sunlight penetrates to the forest floor, as well as secondary growth that succeeds clearing and cultivation. Although in some places it is common and even abundant, it is secretive, largely nocturnal, and seldom seen. Consequently, very little is known about its ecology and behaviour, although presumably it fills the same niche as the dwarf antelope, which has been studied in Gabon. Its narrow muzzle and long tongue are adapted for browsing very selectively on leaves, forbs, vines, and the like, including cultivated plants.
Unlike most other members of the tribe, which live in monogamous pairs (e.g., the dik-dik), the royal antelope is apparently solitary and polygynous: females live singly in home ranges as small as 2 hectares (5 acres), several of which may be included in the territory of a male. The dwarf antelope breeds year-round, with seasonal peaks and produces a single offspring after an estimated gestation of six months (maybe less).
