Sable,  (Martes zibellina),  graceful carnivore of the weasel family, Mustelidae, found in the forests of northern Asia and highly valued for its fine fur. The common name is sometimes also applied to related European and Asian species and to the American marten (Martes americana). The sable ranges from about 32 to 51 cm (13 to 20 inches) long, excluding the 13–18-cm (5.1–7.1-inch) tail, and weighs 0.9–1.8 kg (2–4 pounds). Its body colour varies from brown to almost black, sometimes with a throat patch from dusky to salmon.
The sable is solitary and arboreal in habits, feeding on small animals and eggs. The unusually long gestation of about 250 to 300 days is caused by delayed implantation of the fertilized egg in the wall of the uterus. The litter numbers from one to four.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the sable as a species of least concern. Estimates from studies conducted in the early 2010s of Russian sables place that country’s sable population at more than two million animals.
