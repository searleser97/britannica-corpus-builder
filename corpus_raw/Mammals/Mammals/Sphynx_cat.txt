Sphynx cat,  Breed of hairless domestic cat, founded on two spontaneous mutations in shorthaired cats. The first occurred in 1975 when Jezabelle, a stray, produced a hairless female kitten, Epidermis, followed by another the next year. The second occurred in 1978, when a male and two female hairless kittens were rescued from the streets of Toronto. Sphynx cats must be bathed regularly to keep the skin free of the oils that the coat on a normal cat absorbs, and the very large ears must be cleaned regularly to rid them of dust and dirt and prevent wax buildup.
