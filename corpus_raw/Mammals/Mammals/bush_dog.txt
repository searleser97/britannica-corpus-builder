Bush dog,  (Speothos venaticus), also called savannah dog,  small, stocky carnivore of the family Canidae found in the forests and savannas of Central and South America. The bush dog has short legs and long hair and grows to a shoulder height of about 30 cm (12 inches). It is 58–75 cm long, exclusive of its 13–15-centimetre tail. It weighs about 5–7 kg (11–15 pounds) and is brown with reddish or whitish forequarters and dark hindquarters and tail. Bush dogs hunt in packs and feed largely on rodents; however, they appear to seek out agouti and armadillos in some parts of their range.
Bush dogs have been classified as a near threatened species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) since 2011. Ecologists note that the increasing rate of habitat loss and fragmentation resulting from the conversion of natural areas to urban and agricultural land uses, combined with declines in their prey from illegal poaching and increased exposure to diseases transmitted by domestic dogs, is causing the bush dog population to decline, despite its extensive geographic range.
