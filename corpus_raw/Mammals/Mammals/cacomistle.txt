Cacomistle, also spelled Cacomixl,  (Bassariscus), either of two species of large-eyed, long-tailed carnivores related to the raccoon (family Procyonidae). Cacomistles are grayish brown with lighter underparts and white patches over their eyes. The total length is about 60–100 cm (24–40 inches), about half of which is the bushy, black-and-white-ringed tail. The animals weigh about 1 kg (2.2 pounds) and have small faces with long ears and pointed snouts. They are arboreal and nocturnal and feed on a variety of small animals, fruit, and vegetation. The gestation period is about 51–54 days, and litters contain from one to five (usually three or four) young.
The species B. astutus, widely known as miner’s cat, ringtailed cat, or ringtail, is found in rocky areas from the southwestern United States to southern Mexico. It is an agile animal with rounded ears and semiretractile claws. It is sometimes kept as a pet and is an excellent mouser. The species B. (formerly Jentinkia) sumichrasti ranges in forests from Central America to Peru. Larger, darker-furred, and more arboreal than the ringtail, it has pointed ears and nonretractile claws.
