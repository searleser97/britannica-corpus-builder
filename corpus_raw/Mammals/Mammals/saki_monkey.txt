Saki,  any of 22 species of arboreal South American monkeys having long nonprehensile furred tails. The 16 species of “true” sakis of the genus Pithecia are approximately 30–50 cm (12–20 inches) long, not including the bushy, tapering tail of 25–55 cm (about 10–22 inches). Females generally weigh less than 2 kg (4.4 pounds) and males more than 2 kg. These sakis are covered with long coarse hair that falls like a hood on the head and a cape over the shoulders.
The male white-faced, or pale-headed, saki (Pithecia pithecia) is black with a whitish face surrounding the dark muzzle, but the female is grizzled gray with a gray face and a white line on either side of the muzzle. Several other species, including the monk saki (P. monachus), are grizzled gray with less difference between the sexes. Sakis are active by day (diurnal) and live in monogamous pairs. They feed on fruit, leaves, and especially seeds, which they grind in their powerful jaws. Births are single; the young at first cling to the female’s belly and later are carried on her back until they are able to travel independently. They are gentle in captivity but nervous and difficult to keep.
Bearded sakis (Chiropotes) are not as well known as true sakis. Each of the six species is about 40–45 cm (about 16–18 inches) long, excluding the heavily furred tail, which ranges in length from slightly shorter to slightly longer than the body. Females weigh 2.5 kg (5.5 pounds) on average, males about 3 kg (6.6 pounds). They have dense coats of long, primarily black hair, and the tails are rounded. On the head, their bouffant hair parts in the centre, grows thickly along the sides of the face, and extends into a full, heavy beard. Bearded sakis are diurnal and live in small groups with several individuals of both sexes, and their diet is similar to that of true sakis.
Related to uakaris, sakis belong to the subfamily Pitheciinae of the order Primates.
