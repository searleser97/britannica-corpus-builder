dromedary,  Arabian (one-humped) riding camel (Camelus dromedarius), a swift domestic species not found in the wild. Although wild dromedaries are extinct, the importation of dromedaries to Australia in the 19th century resulted in the establishment of a feral population that continues to live in the countryâ€™s interior. Being longer legged and slimmer than the Bactrian (two-humped) camel, dromedaries have been known to carry a rider 115 miles (185 km) in less than 11 hours, and racing dromedaries can reach a top speed of 40 miles (65 km) per hour over short distances.
