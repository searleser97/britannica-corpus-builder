Disk-winged bat,  (family Thyropteridae),  any of three species of bats inhabiting Central America and northern South America that are distinguished by round disks at the base of the thumb and on the sole of the foot.
The disks act as suction cups and enable the bats to cling to smooth surfaces. One disk alone is capable of supporting the weight of the bat’s body. Disk-winged bats are small, reddish-brown bats, about 3.4 to 5.2 cm (1.4 to 2 inches) in length with tails about 2.5 to 3.3 cm (0.9 to 1.3 inches) long. Average weight is approximately 4 grams (0.14 ounce). Spix’s disk-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor) lives in small, cohesive colonies that roost in rolled-up leaves. It is unique among bats for its “heads-up” roosting posture.
