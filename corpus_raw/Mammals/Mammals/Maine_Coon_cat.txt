Maine coon cat,  North Americaâ€™s only native breed of longhaired domestic cat. Though its origins are unknown, it was first shown in Boston in 1878. Maines are large, muscular, and heavy-boned; they may have been named for their raccoon-like tail. Excellent mousers, they are known for their gentleness, intelligence, and kind disposition, and are especially good with children and dogs. Most are brown tabbies.
