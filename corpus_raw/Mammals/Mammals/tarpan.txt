Tarpan,   European wild horse that survived in small herds in remote parts of central Europe during the Middle Ages but became extinct early in the 20th century. It is likely that late survivors crossed with domesticated horses. The Munich Zoo produced a tarpan-like horse by selective breeding of domestic horses known to have tarpan ancestry. These specimens are exhibited in zoos in the United States and Europe. They are small, dun-coloured horses with flowing manes and tails.
