Rottweiler,  a breed of working dog which is thought to be descended from drover dogs (cattle-driving dogs) left by the Roman legions in Rottweil, Germany, after the Romans abandoned the region during the 2nd century ce. The Rottweiler accompanied local butchers on buying expeditions from the Middle Ages to about 1900, carrying money in a neck pouch to market. It has also served as a guard dog, a drover’s dog, a draft dog, a rescue dog, and a police dog.
Characteristically stocky and strongly built, the Rottweiler stands approximately 22 to 27 inches (56 to 68.5 cm) tall and weighs between 90 and 110 pounds (41 and 50 kg). It has a short, coarse, black coat with tan markings on its head, chest, and legs. The Rottweiler’s historic role as a guardian and herder has honed the breed’s instinct for wariness and protectiveness when encountering strangers. Rottweilers are known for their confidence and intelligence; however, they also require a steady training regimen to learn social skills.
The formal history of the breed dates back to 1901, with the production of the first standard Rottweiler by the International Club for Leonbergers and Rottweiler Dogs in Germany. The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1931.
