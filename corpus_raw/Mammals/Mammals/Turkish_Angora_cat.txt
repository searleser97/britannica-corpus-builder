Turkish Angora cat,  Breed of longhaired domestic cat that probably arose from a domesticated cat of Tatars who migrated to Turkey, where it is now regarded as a national treasure. It has a long body, fine bones, a pointed face, and a silky, medium-length coat. White is the most popular colour, but it may be any of several solid colours or any pattern of two or more colours.
