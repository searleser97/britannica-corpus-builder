Setter,  any of three breeds of sporting dogs used in pointing game birds. Setters are derived from a medieval hunting dog, the setting spaniel, that was trained to find birds and then to set (i.e., crouch or lie down) so that a net could be thrown over both the birds and the dog. When firearms were adopted, setters were trained to adopt a more upright stance. See English setter; Gordon setter; Irish setter.
