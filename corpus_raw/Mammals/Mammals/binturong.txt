binturong,  (Arctictis binturong), also called bear cat or cat bear,  catlike carnivore of the civet family (Viverridae), found in dense forests of Southeast Asia. Its range extends from Nepal, India, and Bhutan southward to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java and eastward to Borneo. It has long shaggy hair, tufted ears, and a long, bushy, prehensile tail. The colour generally is black with a sprinkling of whitish hairs..
The head and body measure about 60–95 cm (24–38 inches) and the tail an additional 55–90 cm (22–35 inches); weight ranges from about 9 to 14 kg (20 to 31 pounds). The binturong is principally nocturnal and crepuscular (that is, active during twilight). It is found most often among the trees, using its prehensile tail as an aid in climbing. It feeds mainly on fruit, such as figs, but it also takes eggs and small animals. In some areas binturongs are tamed and have been reported as being affectionate pets.
Binturongs are classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Despite the large geographic range of the species, binturong populations have been declining since the 1980s. Ecologists have noted that population losses in Indonesia and Malaysia are the product of deforestation and the conversion of many lowland habitats to oil palm plantations, whereas in the northern parts of their geographic range the losses stem from habitat loss combined with hunting pressure.
