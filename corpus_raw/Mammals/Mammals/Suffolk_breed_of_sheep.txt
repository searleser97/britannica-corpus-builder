Suffolk,   breed of medium-wool, dark-faced, hornless sheep developed in England during the years 1800 to 1850 by mating Norfolk horned ewes with Southdown rams. Suffolks are prolific, early maturing sheep with excellent mutton carcasses. They are energetic, and the whole carriage is alert, showing stamina and quality. The breed is not desirable for wool production. The fleeces are short in staple and light in weight, and they have black fibres. Introduced into the United States in 1888, the Suffolk is a popular lamb producer throughout the country, including the rangeland.
See the Table of Selected Breeds of Sheep for further information.
