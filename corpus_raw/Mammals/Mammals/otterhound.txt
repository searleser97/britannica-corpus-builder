Otterhound,  dog breed first described in the 14th century. Developed in England to hunt otters on both land and water, it resembles a rough-coated bloodhound and has a large head, pendulous ears, and a dense, shaggy, water-resistant coat. Its webbed feet make it an excellent swimmer. It stands 24 to 27 inches (61 to 69 cm), weighs 80 to 115 pounds (36 to 52 kg), and is usually blue-gray or yellowish brown with black-and-tan markings.
