Palomino,   colour type of horse distinguished by its cream, yellow, or gold coat and white or silver mane and tail. The colour does not breed true. Horses of proper colour, of proper saddle-horse type, and from at least one registered parent of several light breeds can be registered as Palominos. This colour is popular for pleasure and parade classes. Their type and use depend upon their breeding and training. They may conform to the breed types of several light breeds, such as Arabian or American Quarter horse. Two associations, the Palomino Horse Breeders of America, established in 1941, and the Palomino Horse Association, established in 1936, register Palominos.
