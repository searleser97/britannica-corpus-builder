Free-tailed bat,  (family Molossidae), also called mastiff bat,  any of 100 species of bats, so called for the way in which part of the tail extends somewhat beyond the membrane connecting the hind legs. Some free-tailed bats are also known as mastiff bats because their faces bear a superficial resemblance to those dogs.
Swift fliers with long, slender wings, free-tailed bats are small-eyed, often heavy-snouted bats about 4–13 cm (1.6–5.1 inches) long excluding the 1.5–8-cm (0.6–3.1-inch) tail. Their ears are large and are joined across the forehead in some species. Except for the naked, or hairless, bat (Cheiromeles torquatus), which is almost hairless, they have short, velvety, usually dark fur.
Free-tailed bats eat insects and roost in tree hollows, caves, and buildings. They are found worldwide in warm regions. Most species live in groups, and some form colonies with populations numbering in the millions, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) colonies at Carlsbad Caverns National Park and in downtown Austin, Texas. In the past, guano (excrement) was mined from caves in which the bats roosted and was used as fertilizer and to produce sodium nitrate for gunpowder. Free-tailed bats do not hibernate, but some species migrate seasonally.
