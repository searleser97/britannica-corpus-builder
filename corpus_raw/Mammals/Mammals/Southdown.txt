Southdown,   breed of medium-wool, dark-faced, hornless sheep originating in the Sussex hills of England. The oldest of all British breeds of sheep, it has an ideal body conformation for meat production. Its fleece is close and is the finest of the British breeds; but, though white and of good quality, the wool is short and the fleeces relatively light in weight. The colour of its face and legs is brown to light brown or gray. Southdowns are popular in many parts of the world, especially in The Commonwealth and the United States.
See the Table of Selected Breeds of Sheep for further information.
