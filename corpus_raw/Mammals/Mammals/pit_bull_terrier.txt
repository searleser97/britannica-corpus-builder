pit bull, also called American Pit Bull Terrier or Pit Bull Terrier,  fighting dog developed in 19th-century England, Scotland, and Ireland from bulldog and terrier ancestry for hunting, specifically capturing and restraining semi-feral livestock. The name has been applied historically to several breeds of dogs—including the bull terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier—but it is not recognized as a distinct breed by the American Kennel Club. The United Kennel Club, however, first recognized the breed, which it calls the American Pit Bull Terrier, in 1898. The American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA), whose primary focus is fostering the positive features of the American Pit Bull Terrier, such as its loyalty, dedication, and athleticism, also recognizes the breed.
Although these dogs were originally bred and trained to display aggression against other dogs, aggression against human beings was not encouraged because, even while fighting, the dogs had to be handled by their trainers. Dogs displaying this trait were not selected for breeding. However, the resurgence of dogfighting—illegal in the United States, Great Britain, and many other countries—led to irresponsible breeders encouraging such traits in their animals and mistreating them in order to induce a vicious temperament. Well-publicized attacks on people by dogs identified as pit bulls led to the passing of legislation in some jurisdictions banning or restricting the keeping of the breeds. Some humane societies routinely euthanize pit bulls that come into their possession, deeming them unsuitable for adoption. In response to the breed’s negative reputation, numerous pit bull owners and owner organizations (such as the ADBA) routinely condemn the breed’s mistreatment by irresponsible owners, arguing that any dog breed is capable of similar aggressive behaviour when trained improperly.
