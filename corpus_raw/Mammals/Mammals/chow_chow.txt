Chow chow,  breed of dog that differs from most others in having a blue-black tongue. The breed originated in China and is known to date to the Han dynasty (206 bcâ€“ad 220); it is believed by some to be one of the oldest of all breeds and is genetically very close to the wolf. The name chow chow is apparently derived from an English term used in the 19th century to refer to cargo from the Orient. The chow chow is built compactly, with a large head and a thick coat that forms a dense ruff about the neck. The tail curls over the back or to either side of it. The coat, which can be either smooth or rough, is evenly coloured in any of various shades, most commonly reddish brown, black, or blue-gray. The adult stands about 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 cm) and weighs 45 to 70 pounds (20 to 32 kg). Temperamentally, the breed is usually loyal to owners but reserved and aloof with strangers.
