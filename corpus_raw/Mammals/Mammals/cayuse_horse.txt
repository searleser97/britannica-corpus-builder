Cayuse, in full Cayuse Indian pony,  North American wild or tame horse, descended from horses taken to the New World by the Spanish in the 16th century. The small and stocky horse had become a distinct breed by the 19th century. It was named for the Cayuse people of eastern Washington and Oregon. Although its ancestry has been difficult to establish with certainty, it is thought to have descended from Spanish Barb horses taken to the New World by the Spanish in the 16th century and to have been crossbred with Percherons, draft horses from France that had been imported by French Canadians. The Cayuse is notable for its combination of speed and endurance. In the 21st century the breed was relatively rare.
