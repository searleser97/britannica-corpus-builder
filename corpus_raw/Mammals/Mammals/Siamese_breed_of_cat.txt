Siamese,  popular short-haired breed of domestic cat originally from Thailand, a country whose official name was Siam until 1939. The Siamese is a lithe long-bodied cat with slim legs and a long slim tail. It has a long wedge-shaped head and blue eyes. Some Siamese have crossed eyes or kinked tails, but these features are discouraged by breeders of show animals. The Siamese was first exported from Siam to the United States in 1878 and the United Kingdom in 1884. By 1902 the first cat fanciers club devoted to the Siamese cat had been established in the United Kingdom, and by 1906 the Cat Fanciers’ Association had officially recognized the breed.
Kittens are born white or cream coloured and later develop the dark points (ears, face, legs, and tail) characteristic of the breed. The points may be dark brown (seal point), blue gray (blue point), milk-chocolate brown (chocolate point), pinkish gray (lilac point), or reddish orange (red point). The colour and coat pattern are genetically recessive characteristics; that is, neither feature is apparent in the immediate offspring of a Siamese that is mated with some other breed. Such dark points are manifestations of temperature-sensitive albinism, in which the black pigment eumelanin, a type of melanin, is concentrated in the cat’s extremities.
Despite the cat’s graceful build and relatively small size, the Siamese is muscular and agile. Characterized as affectionate and loyal, though sometimes destructive, it is regarded by some of its admirers as the most intelligent of domestic cats. It is highly vocal and possesses a range of cries, including a penetrating mating call.
