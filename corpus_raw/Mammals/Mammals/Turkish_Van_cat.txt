Turkish Van cat,  breed of semilonghaired domestic cat distinguished mainly by its unusual colour pattern: white, with coloured markings only on the head and tail. “Van” is a common term in the breed’s native region, Central and South Asia, and is also used  to describe other cats with similar markings. The breed was brought to Europe by returning Crusaders. A unique feature is its cashmerelike waterproof coat; it loves water, and in its native region it has been called the swimming cat. It is large, active, and intelligent.
