Santa Gertrudis,  breed of beef cattle developed in the 20th century by the King Ranch in Texas. It originally resulted from crossing Brahman bulls of about seven-eighths pure breeding and purebred Shorthorn cows. Over a period of years beginning with first crosses in 1910, selective breeding was practiced in which preference was given to red colour without sacrificing type and conformation. Santa Gertrudis cattle are usually solid red in colour with occasional small white markings on the forehead or in the region of the flanks. They were developed from foundation stocks of about five-eighths Shorthorn and three-eighths Brahman ancestry.
Santa Gertrudis cattle are generally the heaviest of the beef breeds. They have great depth and length of body, with more loose skin about the neck, brisket, and navel than the breeds of strictly British origin. They proved to be highly adaptable to the semitropical U.S. Gulf Coast.
