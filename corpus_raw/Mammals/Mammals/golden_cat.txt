Golden cat,  either of two cats of the family Felidae: the African golden cat (Profelis aurata), or the Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii), also known as Temminck’s cat.
The African golden cat is a solitary, nocturnal inhabitant of tropical forests. It is 90–100 cm (36–40 inches) long, including the 20–25-cm tail, and stands about 40 cm at the shoulder. The coat is either solid reddish brown or grayish brown above, and white with dark spots below.
The Asian golden cat, also a forest dweller, is found in India and Southeast Asia. Its coat is typically an unmarked, deep, reddish brown above and paler below, with white and black markings on the face. Its colour varies, however, and may be brown or grayish; in China the coat is reported to have dark markings. The adult cat measures from 75 to 85 cm long, excluding the 40–48-cm tail. It preys on birds and small mammals and reportedly bears its litters of two or three young in hollow trees or other secluded den sites.
