Chevrotain,  (family Tragulidae), also called mouse deer,  any of about 10 species of small, delicately built, hoofed mammals that constitute the family Tragulidae (order Artiodactyla). Chevrotains are found in the warmer parts of Southeast Asia and India and in parts of Africa. They are classified into the genera Hyemoschus, Moschiola, and Tragulus.
Chevrotains are shy, solitary, evening- and night-active vegetarians. They stand about 30 cm (12 inches) tall at the shoulder and characteristically walk on the hoof tips of their slender legs. The fur is reddish brown with spots and stripes of paler colour or white; the underside is pale. The males have small curved tusks protruding downward out of the mouth from the upper jaw.
Asian chevrotains are placed in the genus Tragulus. The genus is made up of about six species that together inhabit the forests of the Greater Sunda Islands, the Philippines, southern China, and mainland Southeast Asia. One of the most reclusive members of the group, the silver-backed chevrotain (T. versicolor), which was first described in 1910, was not photographed in the wild until 2019. The water chevrotain (Hyemoschus aquaticus), larger than the Asian forms, is found in western equatorial Africa. It inhabits thick cover on the banks of rivers and, when disturbed, seeks escape in the water. While some taxonomies place all Indian chevrotains in the species Moschiola meminna, others divide the group into three species (M. meminna, M. indica, and M. kathygre).
