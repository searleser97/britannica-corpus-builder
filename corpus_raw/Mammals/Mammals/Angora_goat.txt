Angora goat,  breed of domestic goat originating in ancient times in the district of Angora in Asia Minor. The goatâ€™s silky coat yields the mohair of commerce. The Angora had been widely but unsuccessfully imported into Europe by the mid-18th century, but not until the animal was established in South Africa a century later did the Western mohair industry develop. Importation of the Angora goat to the United States followed shortly, with development centring in Texas and the Southwest.
The Angora is generally smaller than other domestic goats and sheep. Both sexes are horned, and the ears are long and drooping. The strong elastic fibre of the coat differs from wool primarily in its smoothness and lustre. See mohair.
