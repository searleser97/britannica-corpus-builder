Polecat,   any of several weasellike carnivores of the family Mustelidae (which includes the weasel, mink, otter, and others). The pelt, especially of the European polecat, is called fitch in the fur trade.
The European, or common, polecat, also called foul marten for its odour (Mustela, sometimes Putorius, putorius), occurs in woodlands of Eurasia and North Africa. It weighs 0.5–1.4 kg (1–3 pounds) and is 35–53 cm (14–21 inches) long exclusive of the bushy tail, which is 13–20 cm long. Its long, coarse fur is brown above, black below, and marked with yellowish patches on the face. Much lighter fur distinguishes the masked, or steppe, polecat (M. p. eversmanni) of Asia.
Principally terrestrial, the polecat hunts at night, feeding on small mammals and birds. It also eats snakes, lizards, frogs, fishes, and eggs. The polecat is more powerful than the marten but less active, and it rarely climbs trees. Its litters of three to eight young are born in the spring after about two months’ gestation. The domestic, albino variety of the European polecat is known as the ferret (q.v.).
The marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna) of Eurasian foothills and steppes is similar to the European species in habits, appearance, and size. It is mottled reddish brown and yellowish above, blackish below.
The zorille (q.v.), a related African carnivore, is also called striped, cape, or African polecat. In the United States the name polecat is often applied to skunks (see skunk), particularly the spotted and striped species.
