Doberman Pinscher, also called Doberman or Dobe,  breed of working dog developed in Apolda, Germany, by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann, a tax collector, night watchman, dogcatcher, and keeper of a dog pound, about 1890. The Doberman Pinscher is a sleek, agile, and powerful dog standing 24 to 28 inches (61 to 71 cm) and weighing 60 to 88 pounds (27 to 40 kg). It has a short smooth coat, black, blue, fawn, or red in colour, with rust markings on the head, throat, chest, base of the tail, and feet. The breed has a reputation for fearlessness, alertness, loyalty, and intelligence.
During his time as a dogcatcher and pound keeper, Dobermann was thought to have crossed several breeds—including the Rottweiler, German Pinscher, Black and Tan Terriers, Weimaraner, and short-haired shepherds—to develop the breed, which was first registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1908. The Doberman Pinscher Club of America, an organization devoted to promoting the purity of the breed, was founded in Michigan in 1921, by George Earle III, an American diplomat who also served as governor of Pennsylvania from 1935 to 1939. Doberman Pinschers have been used in police and military work (such as in message delivery, scouting, and guarding) and as a watchdog and as a guide dog for the blind.
