Ox,   (Bos taurus, or B. taurus primigenius), a domesticated form of the large horned mammals that once moved in herds across North America and Europe (whence they have disappeared) and Asia and Africa, where some still exist in the wild state. South America and Australia have no wild oxen. Oxen are members of the Bovidae family.
The castrated male of B. taurus is a docile form especially useful as a draft animal in many less developed parts of the world. Oxen are also used for food in some areas.
