Fisher,  (Martes pennanti), also called fisher cat, black cat, black fox, or pékan,  North American carnivore of northern forests (taiga), trapped for its valuable brownish black fur (especially fine in the female). It is a member of the weasel family (Mustelidae). The fisher has a weasel-like body, bushy tail, tapered muzzle, and low rounded ears.
Adults are usually 50–63 cm (20–25 inches) long, excluding the 33–42-cm (13–16.5-inch) tail, and weigh 1.4–6.8 kg (3–15 pounds). Males are larger and heavier than females. The fisher hunts both on the ground and in trees, attacking various rodents (including porcupines) and other animals. Its diet also includes fruits and sometimes nuts. A litter contains one to five young, born after a gestation period of 338–358 days, including a delay before implantation of the fertilized egg in the wall of the uterus.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the fisher to be a species of least concern. Population estimates suggest that more than 100,000 fishers remain in North America.
