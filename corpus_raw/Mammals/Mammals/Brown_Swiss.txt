Brown Swiss,  cattle breed native to Switzerland and probably one of the oldest breeds in existence. While these cattle are classified as a dairy breed in the United States, they are often considered a dual-purpose breed elsewhere, as they are heavier boned and thicker fleshed than the cattle of the other dairy breeds. The colour of the Brown Swiss varies from light brown or gray to dark shades of these colours. Brown Swiss cows are good, persistent milkers, producing milk of average butterfat content as compared with other breeds of dairy cattle.
This breed has found favour in Italy, Austria, Hungary, the United States, Mexico, and the South American countries. Brown Swiss were first introduced into the U.S. in 1869.
