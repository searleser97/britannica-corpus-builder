Cashmere goat, also called Kashmir goat,  a breed of domestic goat valued for its soft wool, used for the manufacture of cashmere shawls. It varies in build and colour but the most highly esteemed has large ears, slender limbs, curved spreading horns not spirally twisted, and a long, straight, silky white coat. Beneath the outer coat of coarse hair the fluffy, soft underfur or pashm (present in all goats) is particularly luxuriant and forms the product for which the breed is valued.
