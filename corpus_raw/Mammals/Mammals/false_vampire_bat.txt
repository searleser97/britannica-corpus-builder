False vampire bat,   any of certain bats of the Old World genera Megaderma, Cardioderma, and Macroderma (family Megadermatidae) and the New World genera Vampyrum and Chrotopterus (family Phyllostomatidae), conspicuous because of their large size and originally thought to feed on blood, as do the true vampire bats. The false vampires are now known to be carnivorous, preying mainly on small vertebrates such as other bats, lizards, and mice.
These large, grayish or brownish bats range in size from 6.5 cm (about 2.5 inches) for Megaderma species up to 14 cm for the Australian false vampire, or ghost, bat (Macroderma gigas), the largest bat in the suborder Microchiroptera. The tropical American false vampire (Vampyrum spectrum), measuring about 13.5 cm, is the largest New World bat. False vampires are tailless (except Chrotopterus, which has a tiny tail), and each species has a conspicuous nose leaf (a flap of skin and connective tissue around the nostrils) and large rounded ears. In the megadermatids the ears are joined at the base, which may help stabilize them during flight, and the eyes are relatively large.
False vampires roost in caves and hollow trees; Vampyrum species often roost in pairs with some of their offspring. The African false vampire (Cardioderma cor), which eats mostly large invertebrates, forages by hanging in wait, listening for its prey. The capture is made with a short, rapid flight. The Australian false vampire is considered an endangered species.
