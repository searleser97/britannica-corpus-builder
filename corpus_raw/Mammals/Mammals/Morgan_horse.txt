Morgan,  breed of horse that was once the most famous and widely disseminated in the United States. The Morgan declined in popularity, and for a while breeding was supervised by the government. The breed was founded by a horse known as Justin Morgan, after his owner. Though the horse died in 1821, his individual stamp still persists. He stood approximately 14 hands (56 inches, or 142 cm) high and was a compact, active, and virile horse whose pedigree was probably a blend of Thoroughbred and Arabian, with some other elements as well. The modern Morgans average about 14.1 to 15.2 hands (57 to 61 inches, or 145 to 155 cm) in height and from 900 to 1,100 pounds (400 to 500 kg) in weight. They are stylish and attractive, with smooth lines, small ears, expressive eyes, and a nicely crested neck. They are all-purpose horses, though they lean toward the riding-horse type more than formerly. The American Morgan Horse Register was first published in 1894 by Colonel Battell of Middlebury, Vermont, who traced Justin Morganâ€™s descendants and encouraged Morgan breeding. The Morgan Horse Club, later succeeded by the American Morgan Horse Association, was organized in 1909 and took over the Register.
