Standardbred,   breed of horse developed in the United States in the 19th century and used primarily for harness racing. The foundation sire of this breed was the English Thoroughbred Messenger (1780–1808), imported to the United States in 1788. His progeny, of great trotting capacity, were bred with other breeds and types, especially the Morgan, to produce speedy trotters and pacers. Messenger’s great-grandson Hambletonian (1849–76) was an outstanding Standardbred sire whose descendants now dominate the breed.
Possessed of considerable stamina and endurance, Standardbreds closely resemble Thoroughbreds but are usually smaller and have longer and lower bodies, flatter ribs, and heavier bones. Height and weight vary considerably but average 15 to 16 hands (60 to 64 inches [152 to 163 cm]) and 900 to 1,000 pounds (410 to 450 kg). Bay is the most common colour for Standardbreds, but brown, black, chestnut, or gray also are found. The name Standardbred originated in the early development of the breed, when horses were registered in the official studbook (Wallace’s American Trotting Register, first published in 1871) if they could meet certain standards of speed, such as trotting a mile in 2 1/2 minutes. The official history of the breed dates from the establishment in 1871 of the National Association of Trotting Horse Breeders, which was succeeded by the American Trotting Register Association, now the U.S. Trotting Association.
