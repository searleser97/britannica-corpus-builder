Alaskan Malamute,  sled dog developed by the Malemiut, an Eskimo (Inupiat) group from which it takes its name. The Alaskan Malamute is a strongly built dog, with a broad head, erect ears, and a plumelike tail carried over its back. Its thick coat is usually gray and white or black and white, the colours frequently forming a caplike or masklike marking on the head. The Alaskan Malamute stands about 23 to 25 inches (58 to 63.5 cm) high and weighs 75 to 85 pounds (34 to 39 kg). Characteristically loyal and friendly, it has been used to haul freight on sleds and has served on expeditions to Antarctica.
