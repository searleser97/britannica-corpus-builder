Pony,  any of several breeds of small horses standing less than 14.2 hands (147 cm, or 58 inches) high and noted for gentleness and endurance. Among the common pony breeds are the Shetland, whose docile nature and good endurance make it desirable as a pack animal and a riding horse for children; the Welsh, a hardy breed with fine endurance and style; the Welsh Cob, noted for its high-stepping action; the Exmoor and Dartmoor, native to the moors of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, England, and now used to breed polo ponies; and the Highland, a thick, gray saddle animal.
