Ayrshire,  breed of hardy dairy cattle originating in the county of Ayr, Scotland, in the latter part of the 18th century and considered to be the only special dairy breed to have originated in the British Isles. The body colour varies from almost pure white to nearly all cherry red or brown with any combination of these colours; black or brindle are considered undesirable. The beef qualities of the breed are of secondary importance. The distribution of the breed is wide, and exportations have been made to many countries. It is most strongly represented in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.
