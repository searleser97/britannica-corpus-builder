Holstein-Friesian,  breed of large dairy cattle originating in northern Holland and Friesland. Its chief characteristics are its large size and black and white spotted markings, sharply defined rather than blended. These cattle are believed to have been selected for dairy qualities for about 2,000 years. They have long been widely distributed over the more fertile lowlands of continental Europe, where they are valued highly for their milk-producing ability. In the United States the Holstein-Friesians outnumber all other dairy breeds and produce nine-tenths of the milk supply. The milk, however, has a relatively low butterfat content.
When the Dutch colonized New York, they brought their cattle with them, but after the colony was ceded to the British crown and English settlers brought their own cattle, the Dutch cattle disappeared. The first exportation from Holland to the United States was in 1795, but the largest importations were made between the years 1879 and 1887.
The breed is widely distributed but usually is concentrated in areas having good fluid milk markets. With the emphasis on the production of lean beef, the Friesian either as a purebred or crossed with a beef bull is playing an increasingly important part in beef production in Great Britain and the United States.
