Toggenburg,   breed of dairy goat originating in the Toggenburg valley of Switzerland. The oldest breed of dairy goat in the United States, the Toggenburg has proved widely adaptable. It is characterized by a comparatively small, solid-coloured body of any shade of brown, white ears with a dark central spot, two white stripes down the face, and predominantly white legs. As is that of other goats, milk of the Toggenburg is whiter and more easily digestible than cowâ€™s milk.
See the Table of Selected Breeds of Goats for further information.
