Cleveland Bay,  breed of horse notable for its strength, endurance, and beauty and for its prepotencyâ€”i.e., its ability to impart these characteristics to both purebred and crossbred progeny. Such qualities made the Cleveland Bay one of the most favoured coach horses of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and it continues to be a popular breed of performance horse.
The Cleveland Bay is descended from a strong pack and saddle breed that originated in the Cleveland Hills of North Yorkshire, England, in the Middle Ages. It acquired its present character during the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was crossed with lighter Andalusian and Arabian horses. By the 19th century it was greatly admired as a British cavalry mount, and it became one of the most common draft and coach horses in Britain and the United States. It is now kept as a harness horse for ceremony or competition, and it is crossed with other breeds (most prominently, the Thoroughbred) to produce horses for hunting, driving, jumping, and the three-day event.
Cleveland Bay horses stand 16 to 16.2 hands (64 to 65 inches, or 163 to 165 cm) and weigh 1,400 to 1,500 pounds (635 to 680 kg). They are always a rich bay colour with black mane, legs, and tail. Stud books are kept by the British Cleveland Bay Horse Society (founded 1883) and the Cleveland Bay Horse Society of North America (founded 1885).
