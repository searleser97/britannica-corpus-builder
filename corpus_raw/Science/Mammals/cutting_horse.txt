Cutting horse,   light saddle horse trained to cut (isolate) livestock, especially cattle, from herds. Most are quarter horses, with the intelligence, speed, and ability to make quick starts, stops, and turns. A well-disposed and trained cutting horse can manoeuvre an animal away from a herd and into a corner with little direction from a rider, or, in some contests, without a rider.
