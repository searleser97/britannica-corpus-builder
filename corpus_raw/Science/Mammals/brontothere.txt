Brontothere,  member of an extinct genus (Brontotherium) of large, hoofed, herbivorous mammals found as fossils in North American deposits of the Oligocene Epoch (36.6 to 23.7 million years ago). Brontotherium is representative of the titanotheres, large perissodactyls that share a common ancestry with the horse; indeed, the titanotheres probably were derived from a form that was very similar to the dawn horse (Hyracotherium). Adult brontotheres stood up to 2.5 m (about 8 feet) high at the shoulder. Although the skull was massive and long, the brain was smaller than the brains of most living hoofed mammals. A pair of large horns at the front of the animalâ€™s skull was united at their base but split toward their apex. The teeth were large, but they were primitive and adapted to consuming soft vegetation.
