Shropshire,  breed of medium-wool, dark-faced, hornless sheep originating in the Downs of England. It is one of the most popular farm sheep in the Midwestern United States. It produces good wool and mutton and subsists on sparse pasturage more successfully than breeds such as the Hampshire or Suffolk. For crossbreeding it is better adapted to farms than to range conditions. The Shropshireâ€™s excessive face covering of wool is more easily dealt with on farms.
