Durukuli,  (genus Aotus), also spelled douroucouli, also called owl monkey or night monkey,  any of several species of closely related nocturnal monkeys of Central and South America distinguished by their large yellow-brown eyes. The durukuli is round-headed, with small ears and dense, soft, grizzled gray or brown fur. Weight ranges from 780 to 1,250 grams (1.7 to 2.7 pounds), and length is 25 to 50 cm (10 to 20 inches), not including the bushy tail, which is about the same length and hangs straight down, incapable of coiling or grasping.
Durukulis live in dry and wet tropical forests from Panama to Argentina. These monogamous monkeys, often in family groups of two to five individuals, can be seen with the fathers carrying the young. They sleep together in tree hollows during the day and emerge at night to feed on fruit, nectar, insects, and other small animals. Durukulis are fairly sedentary, and on moonlit nights they can be observed making soft clicks or chirrs, melodius whoops, and low hoots.
These primates belong to the family Cebidae, but species-level taxonomy is unclear in this genus, with as many as nine distinct and geographically disparate species recognized by some authorities. Taxonomy is further complicated by the fact that different populations have from 46 to 56 chromosomes. The monkeys, while fairly common, have not been heavily hunted, although they are in some demand as laboratory animals.
