Ghost bat,  some of the few bats known to possess white or gray fur; not every bat with white fur is called a ghost bat. Ghost bats are tropical, but only one, also called the Australian giant false vampire bat (Macroderma gigas), is found outside Central and South America.  The four ghost bat species of the New World belong to the  genus Diclidurus.
D. albus is snowy-white with dark eyes, yellow-edged ears, and long, nearly transparent wings. Males bear a peculiar hook-shaped ornament on their tail membrane, the function of which is unclear. Compared to other insect-eating bats, D. albus is medium-sized, with a length of about 9 cm (3.5 inches), a body mass of about 20 grams (0.7 ounce), and a wingspan of about 40 cm (16 inches). This species is widely distributed in tropical lowland forest and open areas throughout Central and South America. Its diet consists mostly of moths, which are captured in midair with the large tail membrane and often with the help of a wing. While in flight, this bat continuously emits high-pitched, nearly constant-frequency signals, most of which are inaudible to humans. The echoes of their calls transmit information about type, position, flight speed, and direction of their insect prey. The signals  emitted by these bats are well suited to the open habitats in which they hunt and are very different from the calls of fruit bats, which fly within the forest canopy. Although ghost bats were once considered rare, recent studies using electronic listening equipment indicate that they can be rather common locally. Their abundance suggests that they can play important roles in controlling insect populations.
D. albus and the other Diclidurus species belong to the family Emballonuridae (see sheath-tailed bat), whereas another New World ghost bat, also known as the Honduran white bat (Ectophylla alba), is a leaf-nosed bat. The Australian ghost bat (see false vampire bat) is a larger, grayish bat of the family Megadermatidae.
