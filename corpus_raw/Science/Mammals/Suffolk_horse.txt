Suffolk, also called Suffolk Punch,  smallest draft-horse breed, which originated in Suffolk, Eng. Descended from the medieval “great horse,” the Suffolk is an old breed that has probably had less crossing with other lines than most draft breeds. All registered Suffolks in Britain and North America trace their lineage to “Crisp’s Horse” (born 1768). Suffolks are unusually compact and rotund, with thick, short necks, legs, and backs; they are docile but powerful. They stand 15.2 to 16.2 hands (about 62 to 66 inches, or 157 to 168 cm) high and weigh from 1,600 to 2,000 pounds (725 to 900 kg). The coat is always chestnut-coloured.
The Suffolk Horse Society of Great Britain was organized in 1880. That same year the breed was imported to the United States.
