Mona monkey,  (Cercopithecus mona),  common West African primate found in tropical rainforests; it was introduced to the island of Grenada during the 18th century via the slave trade, and a wild population has established itself there. The mona monkey is a speckled reddish brown in colour, with white underparts and an oval patch of white on each side of the tail. Its face is marked by a pale band across the forehead and a thin black stripe between each eye and ear. The mona monkey is lively and is one of the most widely exhibited members of the guenon group of African monkeys. Related species such as Campbellâ€™s monkey (C. campbelli) and the crested guenon (C. pogonias) are sometimes loosely referred to as monas. All belong to the Old World monkey family, Cercopithecidae.
