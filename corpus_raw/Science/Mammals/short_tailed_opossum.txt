Short-tailed opossum,  (genus Monodelphis),  any of more than 20 species of small, mouse- and shrew-sized, insectivorous and carnivorous, terrestrial opossums (family Didelphidae, subfamily Didelphinae, tribe Marmosini). Total length varies from about 11 cm (4.5 inches) in the smaller species to over 28 cm (11 inches) in the larger. The genus is known from eastern Panama (one species) and throughout South America from the Andes eastward and south to central Argentina. Short-tailed opossums vary in colour from red to black; some are striped dorsally, while others are unicoloured. Claws are long, and some species have front feet modified for digging. Females lack a pouch and may have both abdominal and pectoral mammary glands. Some species may be active at any time, while others are nocturnal. A few species are long-lived (a gray short-tailed opossum [Monodelphis domestica] lived 49 months in captivity); others live only long enough for the female to bear and wean a single litter (semelparous).
