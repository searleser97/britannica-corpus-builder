Homo sapiens sapiens,  in anthropology and paleontology, the subspecies of Homo sapiens that consists of the only living members of genus Homo, modern human beings. Traditionally, this subspecies designation was used by paleontologists and anthropologists to separate modern human beings from more-archaic members of Homo sapiens. H. s. sapiens is thought to have evolved sometime between 160,000 and 90,000 years ago in Africa before migrating first to the Middle East and Europe and later to Asia, Australia, and the Americas.
Currently, H. s. sapiens is the only widely accepted subspecies of H. sapiens, and the necessity of this designation remains a matter of debate, since traditional taxonomic practice subdivides a species only when there is evidence of two or more distinct subgroups. Several subspecies of H. sapiens have been proposed. For example, Swedish naturalist and explorer Carl Linnaeus, in the 10th edition of  his Systema Naturae (1758), classified modern human beings into four subspecies according to geographic origin: H. s. asiaticus, H. s. europaeus, H. s. afer, and H. s. americanus. Linnaeus’s classification was later discarded because of the recognition of racial prejudice and outdated notions of European superiority implicit in his taxonomy and because of discoveries that only superficial differences existed between these groups.
Other groups have been classified as subspecies of H. sapiens—including Neanderthals (H. s. neanderthalensis, which most researchers later reclassified as the species H. neanderthalensis) and a group of specimens that were later placed in the species H. heidelbergensis. By the early 21st century only one group, H. s. idàltu (known primarily from fossil skulls discovered in 1997 near Herto, Ethiopia, and dating to about 160,000 years ago), was being considered as a second subspecies of H. sapiens. Some researchers have argued, however, that the Herto fossils are not distinct enough to justify the creation of a new subspecies.
