placental mammal,  (infraclass Eutheria),  any member of the mammalian group characterized by the presence of a placenta, a vascular organ that develops during gestation, which facilitates exchange of nutrients and wastes between the blood of the mother and that of the fetus. The placentals include all living mammals except marsupials and monotremes. Although some authorities consider the marsupials (cohort Marsupialia) to be placental mammals, these animals have a less-developed, less-efficient type of placenta that limits the gestation period. The true placenta of the placentals allows for a longer developmental period within the protection of the womb, a factor considered to have contributed to the evolutionary success of the group. Fossil evidence shows that the first placental mammals evolved between about 163 million and 157 million years ago during the Jurassic Period (201.3 million to about 145 million years ago).
Some scientists classify placental mammals in the clade Placentalia, which includes all living placental mammals and their most recent common ancestor. This grouping attempts to avoid the potential for confusion associated with fossil evidence of extinct nonplacental eutherians, which were the predecessors of modern-day placentals.
