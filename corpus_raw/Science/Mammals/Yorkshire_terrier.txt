Yorkshire terrier, also called Yorkie,  breed of toy dog developed about the mid-1800s in the English counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire. The lineage of the breed is unknown but appears to include several terriers, such as the Skye and Dandie Dinmont; it may also include the Maltese. The most outstanding feature of the Yorkie is its straight, silky coat, parted on the back from nose to tail and long enough to sweep the ground. Colour is dark blue-gray, with tan on the head and chest. A small, compact dog, the Yorkshire terrier stands about 8 to 9 inches (20 to 23 cm) with a maximum weight of 7 pounds (3 kg). Generally healthy and spirited, it is valued as a pet and companion. In 2006 it became the second most popular dog breed in the United States.
