West Highland white terrier, also called westie,  a short-legged dog standing 10 to 11 inches (25 to 28 cm) tall and weighing 13 to 19 pounds (6 to 8.5 kg). Its coat is pure white and consists of a soft furry undercoat overlaid by a straight, hard outer coat. It is thought that this breed of terrier is descended from the same ancestral stock as the other Scottish terriers—the Dandie Dinmont, Scottish, and cairn terriers. The breed probably originated at Poltalloch, in the former county of Argyll, Scotland. It was bred there for many years by the Malcolm family, whose dogs appear to be traceable back to the time of King James I of England.
West Highland white terriers are energetic and quick to run after almost anything in motion, and they possess a playful temperament. The West Highland white terrier made its debut at a dog show at Crufts in London in 1907. The following year the breed was first registered with the American Kennel Club under the name “Roseneath Terrier,” before formally adopting its current name in 1909.
