Owl-faced monkey,  (Cercopithecus hamlyni), also called Hamlynâ€™s monkey,  arboreal guenon found in tropical forests east of the Congo basin. The owl-faced monkey is greenish gray with black underparts and forelimbs; the lower back and base of the tail are silver-gray. It is named for the white streak running down the length of the nose, which gives it an owl-like appearance, but some individuals living at high altitudes, especially in the bamboo forest of Mt. Kahuzi, Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa), lack this streak. Owl monkeys eat fruit and other vegetation and live in groups consisting of a male and several breeding females.
