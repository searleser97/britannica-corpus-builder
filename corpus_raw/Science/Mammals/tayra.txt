Tayra,  (Eira barbara), also spelled taira,  weasel-like mammal of tropical forests from southern Mexico through South America to northern Argentina. The tayra is short-legged, yet slender and agile, weighing from 2.7 to 7 kg (5.95 to 15.4 pounds). The body, measuring about 60–68 cm (24–27 inches), is covered with coarse but smooth, dark fur. The bushy tail is 39–47 cm (15–18.5 inches) long. The tayra’s dark skin is covered by brown or black fur that is commonly paler on the head and neck. The throat and chest are often marked with a light-coloured, triangular spot.
Despite their limited eyesight, tayras are skilled climbers and have been reported to climb down smooth tree trunks from heights of greater than 40 metres (130 feet). Active both day and night, tayras travel solo, in pairs, or in trios on the ground and in trees; their droppings can often be found on rocky outcrops. Hollow trees or holes in the ground serve as dens. Although classified as carnivores (order Carnivora), tayras are omnivorous, with diets comparable to those of raccoons. Common foods include fruits, insects, and small vertebrates as well as eggs and carrion.
In their forest habitats, tayras often appear inquisitive, moving their heads in an undulating, snakelike fashion to determine scents or sights. When alarmed, tayras may snort, growl, and spit. Although seemingly playful and easily tamed from an early age, tayras make poor pets, being restless and bearing a strong odour. A typical litter is believed to contain three or four young, but, despite their wide occurrence and relatively large size, surprisingly little is known about tayra reproduction, life span, home ranges, or habits. The tayra is a member of the weasel family (Mustelidae), which also includes otters, skunks, and minks.
