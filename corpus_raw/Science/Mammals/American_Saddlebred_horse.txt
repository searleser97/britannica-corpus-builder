American Saddlebred horse, also called American Saddle Horse,  breed of riding horse possessing several easy riding gaits and great vigour and style. It is the prevailing riding horse of horse shows in the United States. The Thoroughbred, Morgan, Standardbred, Arabian, pacers, and easy riding horses of a mixed background contributed various qualities to this American breed. Selection for an easy riding gait, style, and beauty, accompanied by line breeding, helped shape them into a breed.
Average height and weight for the breed are 15 to 16 hands (about 60 to 64 inches, or 152 to 163 cm) and 1,000 to 1,200 pounds (about 450 to 540 kg). The American Saddlebred horse is characterized by a short, strong back; the barrel is rounder than in most light breeds. The neck is long, slender, and well-arched; it blends smoothly into a well-shaped shoulder. The croup is long and almost level. American Saddlebred horses have most of the solid colours with white markings and are shown under flat saddles as either three- or five-gaited horses. The three gaits are the walk, trot, and canter. The five-gaited horse has these three gaits plus the rack and one slow gait, which is usually the stepping pace. Three-gaited horses are shown with a roached (clipped, standing) mane and a clipped tail. Five-gaited horses are shown with a full mane and tail. American Saddlebreds are also used as pleasure horses, as driving horses, and quite often as hunters and jumpers.
American Saddlebred horses were recognized as a distinct breed in 1891, when the American Saddle Horse Breedersâ€™ Association (now American Saddlebred Horse Association, Inc.) was organized. It publishes the American Saddle Horse Register and The American Saddlebred magazine.
