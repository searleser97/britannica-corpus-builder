Slit-faced bat,  (family Nycteridae), also called hollow-faced bat,  any of 16 species of tropical bats, all belonging to the genus Nycteris, which constitutes the family Nycteridae, found in Africa and in the Malaysian and Indonesian regions.
Slit-faced bats have a longitudinal hollow on their faces and a nose leaf (fleshy structure on the muzzle) that is split in the centre. They are about 5–8 cm (2–3 inches) long, excluding a tail of about the same length, weigh 10–30 grams (0.3–1 ounce), and are usually grayish to brown. The tail has T-shaped cartilage on the end, which helps to support the membrane that connects the thighs. They eat insects and usually roost in dark, humid shelters, such as caves, tree hollows, small buildings, and animal burrows.
