Berkshire,  breed of domestic pig originating in England, where in the early 19th century the name “Berkshire” became synonymous with improved pig strains of differing origin and type. Hogs imported from East Asia figured prominently in the improvement of varieties native to the region. The establishment of a herdbook in 1885 fixed current strains.
The Berkshire is medium-sized and predominantly black in colour, with white on its face, legs, and tip of tail. It has a short dished face with erect ears pointing slightly forward. The breed is used for fresh pork production in England, Japan, North and South America, and other areas worldwide. A larger bacon strain has been evolved in Australia and New Zealand.
