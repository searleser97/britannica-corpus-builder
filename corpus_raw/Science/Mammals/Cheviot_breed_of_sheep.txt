Cheviot,  breed of hardy, medium-wool, white-faced, hornless sheep developed in Scotland and Northumberland, England. Cheviots have no wool on their heads and ears or on their legs below the knees and hocks. As a consequence they present a trimmed and alert appearance. The wool of their fleeces is relatively straight, of moderate length, close set, and free from black fibre. Cheviots are frequently used in crossbreeding, especially with Border Leicesters and Lincolns, for market lambs.
