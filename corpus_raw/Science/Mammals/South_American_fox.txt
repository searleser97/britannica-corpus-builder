South American fox,  (genus Lycalopex),  also called South American dog or South American jackal,  any of six South American carnivores of the dog family (Canidae). Although these canines are not actually foxes, they resemble true foxes.
In general, South American foxes are long-haired, rather grayish animals that grow to about 0.5–1 metre (1.6–3.3 feet) in length, excluding the bushy tail, which is 25–50 cm (10–20 inches) long. They are found in open terrain as opposed to thick forest, and they feed on small animals, birds, fruit and other plant material, and insects. Generally nocturnal, they live in abandoned burrows or in dens among rocks or trees. Both parents care for the litters of one to eight young. South American foxes can attack domestic livestock, but they are helpful in controlling rodent populations.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies half of all South American fox species as species of least concern. Only Darwin’s fox (Lycalopex fulvipes), which lives in Chile, is listed as an endangered species. The IUCN has yet to evaluate the conservation status of the hoary fox (L. vetulus), which lives in the grasslands of Brazil, and the Sechuran fox (L. sechurae), which lives along the coasts of northwestern Peru and southwestern Ecuador.
Other foxlike canines of South America are the bush dog(Speothos venaticus), the crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), the maned wolf(Chrysocyon brachyurus), the small-eared zorro (Atelocynus microtis), and the Falkland Island, or Antarctic, wolf (Dusicyon australis), which was hunted to extinction in the late 1800s.
