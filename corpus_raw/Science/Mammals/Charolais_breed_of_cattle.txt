Charolais,  breed of large light-coloured cattle developed in France for draft purposes but now kept for beef production and used for crossbreeding. White cattle had long been characteristic of the Charolais region; recognition of the Charolais breed began about 1775. A typical Charolais is massive and horned and cream-coloured or slightly darker.
The breed was first imported into the United States from a herd in Mexico in 1936, but few Charolais were later imported because of disease problems of the breed in France. The Charolais is crossbred with beef breeds and dairy cows; the Charbray, a mixture of Charolais and Brahman, is a notable example.
