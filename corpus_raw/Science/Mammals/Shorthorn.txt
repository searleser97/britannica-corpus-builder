Shorthorn, also called Durham,  cattle breed raised for beef. The Shorthorn was developed during the last quarter of the 18th century through selective breeding of local cattle of the Teeswater district, Durham county, in the north of England. It is characterized by short horns, blocky conformation, and colour ranging from red, red with white markings, white, or roan resulting from a mixture of red and white hairs. It is the only roan-coloured modern cattle breed.
Shorthorns are found in practically every country of the world. They are numerous in North America, in South America (particularly in Argentina), and in Europe, being one of the more popular breeds in the British Isles; in Australia they have long met with favour and have also been bred quite extensively in South Africa. In the United States, Shorthorns are most numerous in the Corn Belt states but have been used in other areas for grading up native or unimproved cattle.
Within the breed, special strains have been developed, notably the Milking or Dairy Shorthorn, raised for both milk and beef production, and the Polled Shorthorn, a hornless variety.
