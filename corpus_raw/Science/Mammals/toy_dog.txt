Toy dog,  Any of several breeds of dogs that were bred to be small, portable, good-natured companions. Toy dogs were traditionally pampered and treasured by aristocracy around the world, and several breeds are ancient. They range from hairless (e.g., the Chinese crested dog) to profusely coated (e.g., the Shih tzu). Some breeds, such as the Pekingese, could be owned only by royalty. The Cavalier King Charles spaniel was a favourite of English royalty. English toy spaniels and toy poodles are popular in the U.S. The miniature pinscher resembles the Doberman pinscher but has a different ancestry. Other toy dogs include the affenpinscher, Maltese, papillon, Pomeranian, and Yorkshire terrier.
