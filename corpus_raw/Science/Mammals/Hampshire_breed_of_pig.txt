Hampshire,  breed of pig developed in the United States from the Wessex Saddleback and other varieties first imported from England around 1825; in the late 20th century it was one of the predominant breeds in the U.S. The trim, fine-coated Hampshire is black with a white saddle, which includes the forelegs, and its ears are erect and forward pointing. Recent selection has improved the breedâ€™s growing ability, and its carcass is among the highest in quality and quantity of meat.
