Missouri fox-trotting horse,  breed of horse that originated in Missouri and the Ozark Mountains region and is characterized by the “fox trot” gait, a broken gait that occurs when the horse walks briskly with the front feet while trotting with the back feet. Developed from light horses taken to the Ozarks by settlers, the fox-trotting horse was originally a general utility horse but now is a show and riding horse. Sorrel is the usual colour; height varies from 14 to 16 hands (56 to 64 inches, or 142 to 163 cm), and weight averages about 1,000 pounds (450 kg). The Missouri Fox Trotting Horse Breed Association was organized in 1948.
