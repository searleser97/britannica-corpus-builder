Yorkshire, also called Large White,  breed of swine produced in the 18th century by crossing the large indigenous white pig of North England with the smaller, fatter, white Chinese pig. The well-fleshed Yorkshire is solid white with erect ears. Although originally a bacon breed, the Yorkshire rose to prominence in the lean-meat category during the 20th century in the United States. The boar is used considerably as a sire of crossbred litters out of coloured dams. The Yorkshire is probably the most widely distributed breed of pig in the world.
