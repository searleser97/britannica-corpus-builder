Krapina remains,  fossilized remains of at least 24 early Neanderthal adults and children, consisting of skulls, teeth, and other skeletal parts found in a rock shelter near the city of Krapina, northern Croatia, between 1899 and 1905. The remains date to about 130,000 years ago, and the skulls have strong Neanderthal features such as heavy, sloping foreheads and projecting midfaces. The teeth are exceptionally large, particularly the front teeth, and the limbs exhibit the form and strength characteristic of the Neanderthals and their predecessors.
The fragmentation of the Krapina fossils has led some to suggest cannibalism, perhaps during periods of starvation; lesions on the teeth indicate that starvation was a frequent occurrence. Trampling by animals is another possible cause for the shattered bones.
