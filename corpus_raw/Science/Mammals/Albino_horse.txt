Albino,   colour type of horse, characterized by pink skin and a pure white coat. Unlike some other colour types, which develop as the horse matures, the Albino is born white and remains white throughout life. Albinos conform to riding horse type. They are not true biological albinos, however, as they have blue or sometimes brown eyes rather than pink. The American Albino Horse Club, which registers Albinos on the basis of colour, was organized on White Horse Ranch in Nebraska.
