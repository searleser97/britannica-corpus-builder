Saanen,  popular breed of dairy goat originating in the Saanen Valley of Switzerland. The coat of the Saanen is fine and light-coloured, white being generally preferred. In build it is similar to the Toggenburg, with a medium-to-large frame, straight or dished face, and erect ears. The adult Saanen weighs roughly 65 kg (143 pounds). The milk of the Saanen, like that of other goats, is more easily digestible than cowâ€™s milk. The breed is highly valued in Europe and the United States as an even, persistent producer.
