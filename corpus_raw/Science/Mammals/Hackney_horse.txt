Hackney,   stylish carriage horse breed, now used primarily as a show horse. It was developed in the 18th century by crossing Thoroughbreds with the Norfolk trotter, a large-sized trotting harness horse originating in and around Norfolk. An important sire was the Shales horse (about 1760).
Hackneys are heavily muscled, with wide chests, deep bodies, and arched necks; they average 14.2 to 15.2 hands (58 to 62 inches, or 147 to 157 centimetres) high and weigh about 1,000 pounds (450 kilograms). Dark colours are commonest. Noted for their high-stepping, flashy trot, they are high-strung and nervous and must be carefully trained and handled.
The first Hackney was taken to the United States in 1822, and in 1891 the American Hackney Horse Society was organized. See also Hackney pony.
