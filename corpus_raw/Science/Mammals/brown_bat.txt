Brown bat,  any of the bats belonging to the genera Myotis (little brown bats) or Eptesicus (big brown bats). Both are vesper bats, and both are widely distributed, being found in almost all parts of the world. Both genera are insectivorous.
The genus Myotis includes more than 80 species, among them the little brown bat (M. lucifugus) of North America and the large mouse-eared bat (M. myotis) of Europe. Members of the genus are about 3.5–8 cm (about 1.4–3.1 inches) long without the 4–6-cm (1.6–2.4-inch) tail and weigh about 5–45 grams (0.2–1.6 ounces). Apart from humans, they are probably the most widespread genus of land mammals.
Included in the genus Eptesicus are more than 30 species commonly referred to as big brown bats or serotines. These bats are 3.5–7.5 cm long without the 3.5–5.5-cm tail. They are relatively slow, heavy fliers and are often found in buildings and hollow trees. The big brown bat (E. fuscus) is a common North American species, and the serotine (E. serotinus) is a stoutly built Eurasian form.
