Hampshire,  breed of medium-wool, dark-faced, hornless sheep originating in Hampshire, England. It is large and blocky and, as a superior mutton breed, is noted for its early maturity. It is one of the most popular meat breeds in the United States, where it is raised extensively for market-lamb production in farming regions and for crossing with white-faced range ewes in the western range regions for the production of market lambs. The wool of Hampshire fleeces is strong, of medium fineness and length, and desirable for manufacturing purposes except for the occurrence of black fibres in a small percentage of fleeces.
The Oxford, a breed popular in England and in the Great Lakes region of the U.S., was produced in the mid-19th century in Oxfordshire, England, by crossing Hampshires and Cotswolds.
