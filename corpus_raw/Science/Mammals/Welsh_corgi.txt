Welsh corgi,  either of two breeds of working dogs developed to handle cattle. They are similar in appearance but are of different origins. Their resemblance results from crosses between the two breeds.
The Cardigan Welsh corgi (see photograph), named for Cardiganshire, can be traced back to dogs brought to Wales by the Celts about 1200 bc. The original type was known as the Bronant and was related to the progenitors of the dachshund. The Pembroke Welsh corgi (see photograph), of Pembrokeshire, is descended from dogs brought to Wales by Flemish weavers about ad 1100. The ancestors of the Pembroke belonged to the group that produced the Keeshond, Pomeranian, and Samoyed. The corgi gained exposure from its association with the royal family of Britain; Queen Elizabeth II has had corgis since her childhood.
Both Welsh corgis are small, short-legged dogs with foxlike heads and erect ears. The Cardigan has a long tail and ears that are rounded at the tips, while the Pembroke has a short tail and pointed ears. Both are hardy, able farm dogs and good guards and companions. They stand about 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30.5 cm) and weigh 25 to 38 pounds (11 to 17 kg). The Cardigan has a short to medium-long coat of reddish brown, brindle, black with tan or white, or blue-gray with black mottling. The Pembroke has a more finely textured coat of reddish or grayish brown or of black-and-tan. Both breeds may have white markings.
