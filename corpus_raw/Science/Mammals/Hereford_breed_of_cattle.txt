Hereford,  popular breed of beef cattle, the product of generations of breeding work on the part of landed proprietors and tenant farmers in the county of Herefordshire (now in Hereford and Worcester county), England. Herefordshire was noted for its luxuriant grasses, and in that district for many generations the Hereford was bred for beef and draft purposes. The characteristic colour, red with a white face and white markings, has been fixed for only a comparatively short time. When the first herdbook was published in 1846, the editor grouped the breed into four classes: mottle-faced, light gray, dark gray, and red with white faces. Twenty-five years later all but the last had practically disappeared. The outstanding characteristics of the breed are uniformity of colour, early maturity, and ability to thrive under adverse conditions.
Herefords were first introduced into the United States in 1817 by the politician Henry Clay, who imported a young bull, a cow, and a heifer to his home in Kentucky. In the range areas of North America it has become the predominating breed from Canada on the north to Mexico on the south. In Great Britain it is chiefly bred in the county of Hereford and Worcester and its vicinity, although herds of this breed are found in Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. The Hereford also has met with much success under range conditions of Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil.
In the United States a Polled Hereford strain was developed around 1900 by selecting naturally hornless registered Herefords. The number of Polled Herefords has increased rapidly; herds are found throughout the United States, including Hawaii, and the strain has been widely exported.
