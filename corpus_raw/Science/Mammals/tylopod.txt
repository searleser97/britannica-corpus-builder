Tylopod,   any of the pad-footed, even-toed, hoofed mammals of the suborder Tylopoda (order Artiodactyla). This group contains three extinct families and one living family, Camelidae, which contains the camels and the lamoids—the llama, alpaca, guanaco, and vicuña.
The chief distinguishing features of the tylopods are found in the structure of the feet, the bone enclosing the middle ear, the neck vertebrae, the number and form of the teeth, and the absence of horns. The living forms are cud chewers and have a rumen.
