Whippet,  hound breed developed in mid-19th-century England to chase rabbits for sport in an arena. The breed was developed from terriers and small English greyhounds; Italian greyhounds were later bred in to give the whippet a sleek appearance. A greyhoundlike dog standing 18 to 22 inches (46 to 56 cm) and weighing about 28 pounds (13 kg), it has a close, smooth coat, usually gray, tan, or white. Running up to 35 miles (56 km) per hour, the whippet is used for racing and is known in England as the “poor man’s racehorse.” It can also hunt small game and is typically quiet and even-tempered.
