Appaloosa,  colour breed of horse popular in the United States. The breed is said to have descended in the Nez Perc√© Indian territory of North America from wild mustangs, which in turn descended from Spanish horses brought in by explorers. The name derives from the Palouse River of Idaho and Washington. The Appaloosa has several distinctive colour patterns and all of the regular coat colours. Some Appaloosas have a solid colour except for a white patch over the hips, interspersed with small, round spots of the same colour as the body. Others have a basic solid colour with white dots over the entire body or are white with coloured dots (see photograph). They are 14.2 to 16 hands (about 57 to 64 inches, or 144 to 163 cm) tall and weigh from 1,000 to 1,100 pounds (450 to 500 kg). Appaloosas are of light but sturdy conformation. The Appaloosa Horse Club was organized in 1938.
