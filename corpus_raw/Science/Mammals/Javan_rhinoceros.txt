Javan rhinoceros,  (Rhinoceros sondaicus), also called lesser one-horned rhinoceros,  one of three Asian species of rhinoceroses, found only on the island of Java in Indonesia. It is the rarest living rhinoceros and one of the world’s most endangered mammals. The species is restricted to Ujung Kulon National Park, a protected area on a small peninsula extending from the western end of Java.
Although only a few Javan rhinoceroses have ever been measured or weighed, the species is believed to be about the size of the black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis). Those individuals that have been examined were 2–3.2 metres (approximately 6–11 feet) in length and weighed 900–2,300 kg (about 2,000–5,100 pounds). Both males and females have lower incisors resembling tusks, which they use to fight, and the male has short horns about 25 cm (10 inches) long. Females reproduce at intervals of 3–5 years, giving birth to a single calf after a gestation period of 16 months.
The Javan rhinoceros inhabits forests, marshy areas, and regions of thick bush and bamboo. It is an active climber in mountainous country. Javan rhinoceroses are mainly browsers and often feed on pioneer plants that dominate in gaps in the forest created by fallen trees. This species once occupied the islands of Java, Borneo, and Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, and a region extending northward through Myanmar (Burma) into Assam and eastern Bengal. The last known population from mainland Asia, which was located in Cat Loc, Vietnam, had died out by 2011, and thus Ujung Kulon National Park became the final refuge for these animals. In 2020, park managers, relying on camera trap data to identify and track the animals, estimated that no more than 68–74 surviving individuals remained.
