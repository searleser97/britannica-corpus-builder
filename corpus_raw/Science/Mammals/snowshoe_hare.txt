Snowshoe hare,  (Lepus americanus), also called snowshoe rabbit or varying hare,  northern North American species of hare that undergoes an annual colour change from brownish or grayish in summer to pure white in winter. The hind feet are heavily furred, and all four feet are large in proportion to body size, a snowshoe-like adaptation that enables the hare to travel over snow.
