Jersey,  breed of small short-horned dairy cattle originating on Jersey, one of the Channel Islands; it is believed to have descended from French cattle. The colour of the Jersey is usually a shade of fawn or cream, but darker shades are common. In the late 18th century measures were passed prohibiting the importation of cattle into Jersey except for immediate slaughter, and by the early 19th century the indigenous breed came to be recognized as pure. Jersey cattle have been introduced in large numbers into England, one of the earliest herds being formed in 1811. The first exportation of registered Jerseys to the United States was in 1850.
The Jersey is adaptable to a wide range of conditions, and its distribution is worldwide. Jersey milk is remarkably rich in butterfat, and for that reason animals of this breed are in demand for crossing with native stock to improve the butterfat percentage in milk. Jerseys are of great importance where butter is a major product, as in New Zealand and Denmark. Because of their small size and lack of muscular development as well as the yellow colour of body fat, Jerseys have lower beef value than the other major breeds. Their principal capacity lies in their efficient production of milk high in butterfat and milk solids.
