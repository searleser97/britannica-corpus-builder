Scottish fold cat,  Breed of domestic cat with ears that fold forward and down. A Scottish shepherd discovered the foundation cat—Susie, a white barn cat—in 1961. Scottish folds may be longhaired or shorthaired and of various colours and patterns. Susie’s fold was caused by a genetic mutation that does not appear in every kitten. The folded ear and a pedigree that leads back to Susie are required for show. Scottish folds are gentle and quiet.
