Red bat,  (Lasiurus borealis), also called Eastern red bat,  migratory vesper bat (family Vespertilionidae) found in wooded areas of North America. It is about 10 cm (4 inches) long, including a 5-cm (2-inch) tail, weighs 10–15 grams (0.33–0.5 ounce), and has narrow wings and short, rounded ears. The fur is fairly long, chestnut to rusty in colour, and tipped with white. The red bat is a strong, swift flier that spirals down from heights to feed primarily on moths. It also takes flies and beetles and even hunts crickets and cicadas on the ground. Unlike most other bats, it is solitary and bears as many as four young in a single litter.
