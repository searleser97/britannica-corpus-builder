Talapoin,  (genus Miopithecus),  either of two small species of monkeys found in swamp forests on each side of the lower Congo River and neighbouring river systems. Talapoins are the smallest of the Old World monkeys, weighing less than 2 kg (4.4 pounds). M. talapoin, which lives south and east of the river in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa), has been known to science since the 18th century, whereas M. ogouensis, living north and west of the river in the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) and Gabon, was recognized as a distinct species in the 1990s. Both species have long tails and greenish upperparts, but the colour of their fur and several other parts of the body is different and varies among individuals.
Talapoins live in huge troops, usually of 50 to 100, but, in the vicinity of villages, they often number well over 100 and raid root crops, especially manioc (see cassava). Manioc contains high concentrations of poisonous hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and is left by farmers to leach in running water for days before it can be prepared. During this time, talapoins test the leaching roots and eat those that they consider to be safe. Troops of talapoins sleep in trees along watercourses, and when disturbed they drop into the water and swim away. Within the troop, various social behaviours such as aggression, play, and grooming are observed among small groups and individuals.
Talapoins belong to the Old World monkey family, Cercopithecidae. They have sometimes been included with the guenons in the genus Cercopithecus, but talapoinsâ€™ smaller size and the development of sexual swellings in females during estrus warrant their classification as a separate genus.
