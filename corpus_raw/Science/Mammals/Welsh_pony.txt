Welsh pony,  breed of small horse popular as a child’s or an adult’s mount. A hardy breed that developed in the Welsh mountains, the Welsh pony was originally used in coal mines. A saddle type was developed by introducing Thoroughbred and Arabian blood. Welsh ponies are about 12 hands (48 inches, or 122 cm) tall and weigh about 500 pounds (225 kg; see photograph). Coat colour is usually black. They are refined and intelligent, with considerable spirit and good disposition. The Hackney pony (see photograph) was established by crossing Welsh pony mares with Hackney stallions.
In 1884 the first Welsh ponies were imported to the United States, and in 1906 the Welsh Pony Society of America was established.
