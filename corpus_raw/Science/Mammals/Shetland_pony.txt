Shetland pony,  breed of horse popular as a child’s pet and mount. Originating in the Shetland Islands, Scotland, the breed is adapted to the islands’ harsh climate and scant food supply. Shetlands were used as pack horses and in about 1850 were taken to England to work in the coal mines. About the same time, they were introduced to the United States, where a more refined pony suitable for children’s riding was bred.
With the exception of certain dwarf ponies resulting from genetic mutation, the Shetland is the smallest breed of horse. The average height is about 102 cm (40 inches; unlike other horses, Shetlands are not measured in hands). Maximum height is 117 cm. Most colours, including spotting, are found. Shetlands are long-lived and need little care; they are gentle and even-tempered if properly trained.
