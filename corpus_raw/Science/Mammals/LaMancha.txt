LaMancha,  American breed of dairy goat known for its much-reduced external ears. The lineage of LaManchas is uncertain; their relation to goats of the La Mancha region of Spain is not proven. The breed was developed in the early 20th century on the West Coast of the United States from unusually short-eared goats believed to be descended from goats brought to California by Spanish missionaries. Those goats were bred to several other breeds, including Nubians and Alpines, until a distinctive American LaMancha breed was developed. Official recognition by the American Dairy Goat Association came in 1958.
True-bred LaManchas must have one of only two distinct ear types: “gopher ears,” which may be up to 1 inch (2.5 cm) in length but preferably are nonexistent; or “elf ears,” which have a maximum length of 2 inches (5 cm). Only bucks with gopher ears are accepted for breeding, as bucks with elf ears may sire “throwback” kids with standard longer ears. The face must be long and straight; a curved nose of the Nubian type disqualifies a specimen from the show ring.
LaManchas have a short and glossy coat with numerous colour variations and patterns. They are considered a docile breed and are excellent producers of a milk that is high in fat and protein.
