Manx,  breed of tailless domestic cat of unknown origin but presumed by tradition to have come from the Isle of Man. Noted for being affectionate, loyal, and courageous, the Manx is distinguished both by its taillessness and by its characteristic hopping gait. It is compactly built, with a rounded head; large, round eyes; and small, wide-set ears. The rump is also rounded and, because the hindlegs are considerably longer than the forelegs, is distinctly higher than the shoulders. The Manx may be born with a tail but ideally should be totally tailless with a hollow at the end of the backbone where the root of the tail should be. The double coat may be any solid, variegated, or tabby colour.
