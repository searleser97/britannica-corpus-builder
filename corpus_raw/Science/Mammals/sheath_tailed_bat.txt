Sheath-tailed bat,  (family Emballonuridae), also called sac-winged bat,  any of about 50 bat species named for the way in which the tail protrudes from a sheath in the membrane attached to the hind legs. The term sac-winged refers to the glandular sacs in the wing membranes of several genera.
Sheath-tailed bats are found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions. They are usually black, brown, or gray, and some are striped or mottled. They are about 4–10 cm (1.6–4 inches) long, without the 0.6–3-cm (0.2–1.2-inch) tail, and they weigh about 5–30 grams (0.2–1 ounce). Compared with other bats, they shelter in relatively open places, such as shallow caves.
Among the 13 genera of the family are the sac-winged bats (Saccopteryx), which are white-striped bats of Central and South America; ghost bats (Diclidurus), which are white or white and gray bats of the New World; and tomb bats (Taphozous), which are swift-flying bats found from Africa through southern Asia to Australia.
