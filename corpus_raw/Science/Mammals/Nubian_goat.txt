Nubian,  breed of goat, probably native to Africa but common also in India and the Middle East since ancient times. Imported Nubian goats figured prominently in crossbreeding with English varieties in the 19th century; the Anglo-Nubian was developed during this period.
Pendulous ears and a Roman nose are characteristic features of the Nubian, often described as an aristocratic animal. The goatâ€™s short coat may be of any solid colour, parti-coloured, or spotted. Milk of the Nubian is higher in fat than that of most other goats.
