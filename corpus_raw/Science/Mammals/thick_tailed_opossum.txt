Thick-tailed opossum,  (genus Lutreolina), also called lutrine opossum,  any of three species of minklike, aggressive, and mainly carnivorous South American marsupials (family Didelphidae, subfamily Didelphinae) adapted to live along rivers and streams in periodically flooded grassland habitats. One species (Lutreolina turneri) is found in savanna habitats (llanos) from Guyana westward through Venezuela to eastern Colombia. The other species are associated with southern grassland (pampas) habitats from Bolivia and Brazil to northern Argentina.
Adults vary from 46 to 71 cm (18 to 28 inches) in total length and weigh up to 540 grams (1.2 pounds). Drab yellowish brown in colour, the fur is short and dense but not water-repellent. Ears are short, rounded, and partly concealed by the fur of the head. The tail is shorter than the head and body combined, thickly haired at the base, and sparsely haired for most of its length. Thick-tailed opossums have two litters a year; one female was found with seven young in her pouch.
