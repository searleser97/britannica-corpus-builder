Olingo,  (genus Bassaricyon), also called cuataquil,  any of six species of small arboreal carnivores of the raccoon family, Procyonidae, found in the jungles of Central and northern South America. Olingos are slender, grayish brown animals 35–50 cm (14–20 inches) long, excluding the bushy, faintly ringed tail, which accounts for an additional 40–50 cm. They have soft fur, pointed muzzles, and rounded ears. They resemble kinkajous but are less stocky and have narrower snouts and longer-haired, nonprehensile tails. Olingos are nocturnal, often travel in small groups, and feed primarily on fruit. Little else is known of their habits.
The olinguito (Bassaricyon neblina), first described in 2013, can be distinguished from other olingos by its habitat and appearance. Olinguitos are residents of the cloud forests of Colombia and Ecuador and make their homes at altitudes between 1,530 and 2,740 metres (approximately 5,000 and 9,000 feet), whereas other olingos live at lower altitudes. In addition, olinguitos possess reddish brown skins with long fur, compared with the shorter gray fur of other olingo species.
