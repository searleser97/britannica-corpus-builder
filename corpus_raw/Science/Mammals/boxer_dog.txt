Boxer,  smooth-haired working dog breed named for its manner of “boxing” with its sturdy front paws when fighting. The boxer, developed in Germany, includes strains of bulldog and Great Dane in its heritage. Because of its reputation for courage, aggressiveness, and intelligence, it has been used in police work but is also valued as a watchdog and companion. It is a trim, squarely built dog with a short, square-shaped muzzle, a black mask on its face, and a shiny shorthaired coat of fawn (reddish brown) or brindle. It stands 21 to 25 inches (53 to 63.5 cm) and weighs 60 to 70 pounds (27 to 32 kg).
