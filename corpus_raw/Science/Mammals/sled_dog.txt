Sled dog,  any canine used in Arctic climates to pull a sled across snow and ice. The breeds most commonly associated with this work are the Siberian husky, Alaskan Malamute, Samoyed, Eskimo dog, and Laika—all large, powerful dogs with thick coats and high endurance.
On the North American continent a “fan hitch” (where each of 12 to 15 dogs was separately attached to the sled by its own lead) was used to carry both people and supplies. Now a team, usually of 8 dogs, in a “pair hitch” (double file and side by side) is the most common. In the Siberian regions of Russia, smaller teams are used.
