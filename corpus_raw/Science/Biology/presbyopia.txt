Presbyopia,  loss of ability to focus the eye sharply on near objects as a result of the decreasing elasticity of the lens of the eye. The eye’s ability to focus on near and far objects—the power of accommodation—depends upon two forces, the elasticity of the lens of the eye and the action of the ciliary muscle (a roughly ring-shaped muscle that encircles the lens and is attached to it by suspensory ligaments). When the ciliary muscle is relaxed, the ring enlarges away from the lens and the suspensory ligaments are tautened, flattening the lens into a shape suitable for viewing distant objects. When the muscle contracts, the ligaments are loosened, and, because of the elasticity of the lens, the surface of the lens—particularly the front surface—becomes more curved, in keeping with viewing near objects. Ordinarily the lens gradually becomes less elastic (it hardens) with age, so the power of accommodation is lost progressively. The loss is most rapid in the decade of the 40s, the age when most people become aware of difficulty in performing a task, such as reading, that requires near focusing; this can be helped with corrective lenses.
Accommodation may also be lost temporarily as a result of paralysis of the ciliary muscle. With this paralysis, which can occur from the action of certain toxins and medications, the muscle cannot contract, and the surface of the lens is prevented from becoming more convex.
