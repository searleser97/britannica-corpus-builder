Chorea, also called Hyperkinesia,  in dogs, a disorder in which muscle spasms are prominent. It is usually associated with distemper, encephalitis, or other diseases and often appears during the convalescent period. Jaw spasms may interfere with eating, and extreme exhaustion follows severe episodes in which the dog cannot sleep. Treatment involves good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and sedation. Antispasmodic drugs and muscle relaxants are used to relieve the symptoms.
