Paedogenesis, also spelled Pedogenesis,  reproduction by sexually mature larvae, usually without fertilization. The young may be eggs, such as are produced by Miastor, a genus of gall midge flies, or other larval forms, as in the case of some flukes. This form of reproduction is distinct from neotenic reproduction in its parthenogenetic nature (i.e., no fertilization occurs) and the eventual maturation or metamorphosis of the parent organism into its adult form.
