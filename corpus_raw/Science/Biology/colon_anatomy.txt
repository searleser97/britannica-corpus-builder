Colon,  the longest segment of the large intestine. The term colon is often used to refer to the entire large intestine.
The colon extends from the cecum (an enlarged area at the end of the small intestine) up the right side of the abdomen (ascending colon), across to the left side (transverse colon), and down the left side (descending colon) and then loops (at the sigmoid flexure, or sigmoid colon) to join the rectum. The purpose of the colon is to lubricate waste products, absorb remaining fluids and salts, and store waste products until they are ready to be passed from the body. Most absorption occurs in the ascending and transverse regions, where the liquid material received from the small intestine is dehydrated to form a fecal mass.
The inner wall of the colon consists of a mucous membrane that absorbs the fluids and secretes mucus to lubricate the waste materials. The deeper muscle layer is composed of circular and longitudinal muscles. Circular muscles produce the mild churning and mixing motions of the intestine, while the longitudinal ones create the strong massive muscle contractions that actually move the feces.
Disorders associated with the colon range from constipation, diarrhea, gas discomfort, and colitis (inflammation of the colon) to the more serious megacolon (enlarged colon) and cancer.
