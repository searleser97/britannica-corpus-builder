Postmature birth,  in humans, any birth that occurs more than 42 weeks after conception, at which time placental transfer begins to fail and the fetus receives decreased amounts of oxygen and nutrients. If birth does not occur naturally or is not induced, the fetus will die.
Postmature newborns are often thin, with dry, wrinkled skin and unusually long hair and nails. The amniotic fluid may be stained green, indicating the presence of meconium (an infant’s first stool) and introducing the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome, in which the stained fluid is drawn into the infant’s lungs. In severe cases, a ventilator may be required to facilitate breathing.
If the infant lives through the first few days after delivery, its chances for survival are good. Research has suggested, however, that compared with infants who are born at term (42 weeks), infants born postmaturely may be at higher risk for behavioral problems in early childhood.
