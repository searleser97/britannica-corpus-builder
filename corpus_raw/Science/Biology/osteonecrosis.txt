Osteonecrosis, also called necrosis of bone,  death of bone tissue that may result from infection, as in osteomyelitis, or deprivation of blood supply, as in fracture, dislocation, Caisson disease (decompression sickness), or radiation sickness. In all cases, blood circulation in the affected area ceases, bone cells die, and the marrow cavity becomes filled with debris. Surrounding bone resorbs and replaces necrotic bone over a period of months or years. With widespread damage, orthopedic treatment may be required, such as replacement of the dead bone.
