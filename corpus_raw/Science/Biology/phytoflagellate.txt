Phytoflagellate,  any member of a group of flagellate protozoans that have many characteristics in common with typical algae. Some contain the pigment chlorophyll and various accessory pigments and have a photosynthetic type of nutrition, although many organisms included in this group exhibit heterotrophy or mixotrophy. Some species without chlorophyll are similar in form to related chlorophyll-bearing species. Phytoflagellates may obtain nutrients by photosynthesis, by absorption through the body surface, or by ingestion of food particles. For information on specific members of this group, see Euglena; Chlamydomonas; chloromonad; dinoflagellate; cryptomonad; chrysomonad.
