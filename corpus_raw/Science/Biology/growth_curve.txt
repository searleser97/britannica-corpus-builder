Growth curve,  in biology, a curve in graph form that shows the change in the number of cells (or single-celled organisms) in an experimental culture at different times. Growth curves are also common tools in ecological studies; they are used to track the rise and fall of populations of plants, animals, and other multicellular organisms over time. The classic growth curve, as exemplified by a newly established bacterial colony, is divided into four phases, in order of their appearance: (1) lag phase; (2) log (logarithmic), or exponential, phase; (3) stationary phase; and (4) death, or decline, phase.
