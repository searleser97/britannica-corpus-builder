Nymph,   in entomology, sexually immature form usually similar to the adult and found in such insects as grasshoppers and cockroaches, which have incomplete, or hemimetabolic, metamorphosis (see metamorphosis). Wings, if present, develop from external wing buds after the first few molts. The body proportions of the first nymphal stages are quite different from those of the adult. During each successive growing stage (instar) the nymph begins to resemble the adult more closely.
In contrast to nymphs that develop on land, the aquatic young of dragonflies, stoneflies, and mayflies are sometimes called naiads. Their metamorphosis is more complicated, involving a change to a different environment. The aquatic nymph has gills and other modifications for an aquatic existence. Nymphs are an important element in the food of trout and are imitated by the artificial flies and nymphs of anglers. The aquatic nymph at maturity floats to the surface or crawls out of the water, goes through its last molt and emerges as a winged adult.
