Apple scab,  disease of apple trees caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis. Apple scab is found wherever apples and crabapples are grown but is most severe where spring and summer are cool and moist. The disease can cause high crop losses and is thus of economic import to apple growers.
Apple scab produces dark blotches or lesions on the leaves, fruit, and sometimes young twigs. Infections in young leaves often cause leaf deformities, and affected plants may drop their fruit prematurely. All apple species (genus Malus) are affected, though some cultivars have greater resistance. Regular spraying with fungicides is the most effective method of controlling the disease.
