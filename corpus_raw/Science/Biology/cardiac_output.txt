Cardiac output,   in human physiology, volume of blood expelled by either ventricle of the heart. It is customarily expressed as minute volume, or litres of blood per minute, calculated as the product of stroke volume (output of either ventricle per heartbeat) and the number of beats per minute. Maintaining and regulating cardiac output, which is usually proportional to the tissues’ need for oxygen and other nutrients, is one of the circulatory system’s most intricate functions. In the healthy human adult, resting (or basal) output is estimated to be slightly over five litres per minute. Normally, it decreases somewhat when a person changes from recumbent to upright position. It may be increased 50 to 100 percent by anxiety and excitement and as much as fivefold by exercise. Measurement of cardiac output, as first described by the German physiologist Adolf E. Fick in 1870, makes possible an evaluation of respiratory exchange, i.e., the delivery of oxygen to the tissues.
