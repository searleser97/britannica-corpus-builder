Arenavirus,  any virus belonging to the family Arenaviridae. The name of the family is derived from the Latin arenosus, meaning “sandy,” which describes the grainy appearance of arenavirus ribosomes (protein-synthesizing particles). Arenaviruses have spherical, enveloped virions (virus particles) that are 110–130 nm (1 nm = 10−9 metre) in diameter. The nucleocapsid, which consists of a protein shell (or capsid) and contains the viral nucleic acids, is helical and elongated. The arenavirus genome is made up of two segments of negative-sense RNA, and within the nucleocapsid are an endogenous RNA polymerase enzyme and small amounts of ribosomal RNA, which facilitate the transcription of negative-sense RNA into positive-sense RNA and the translation of the positive RNA into protein, respectively.
The arenavirus family consists of a single genus, Arenavirus, which contains more than 20 different species. Arenaviruses are widely distributed in animals and can cause serious disease in humans. The arenaviruses are evolutionarily adapted to specific rodent hosts, which generally show no signs of viral infection and thus act as reservoirs for the virus. Rodents excrete the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. When humans come into contact with food or soil contaminated by these rodent excreta, viral infection may occur, leading to disease. The arenaviruses cause the diseases Lassa fever (Lassa virus; occurring in West Africa), Argentine hemorrhagic fever (Junin virus), Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (Machupo virus), Brazilian hemorrhagic fever (Sabiá virus), and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (Guanarito virus).
