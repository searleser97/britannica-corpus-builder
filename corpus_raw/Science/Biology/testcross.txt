Testcross,   the mating of an organism whose genetic constitution is unknown with an organism whose entire genetic makeup for a trait is known, to determine which genes are carried by the former. In a breed of dog, for example, in which the gene for black coat colour is dominant over (suppresses the effect of) the gene for red coat colour, a dog with a black-coloured coat may be either pure breeding, with two genes for black coat colour, or hybrid, with one gene for black coat colour and one for red coat colour. To determine which genetic endowment the dog has, it is mated to a red-coated dog, which invariably has two genes for red coat colour only. If all the offspring are black, the black-coated parent must be pure breeding and have both genes for black coat colour; if some of the young are red, the parent must be hybrid and have one gene for black coat colour and one for red coat colour.
