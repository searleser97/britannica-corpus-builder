Cell culture,  the maintenance and growth of the cells of multicellular organisms outside the body in specially designed containers and under precise conditions of temperature, humidity, nutrition, and freedom from contamination.

The techniques of cell culture have allowed scientists to use cultures of cells for experimental studies and for biological assays of many types. See tissue culture.
