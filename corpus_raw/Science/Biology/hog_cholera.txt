Hog cholera, also called swine fever or classical swine fever,  serious and often fatal viral disease of swine. Characterized by high fever and exhaustion, the disease is transmitted from infected pigs via numerous carrier agents, including vehicles in which pigs are conveyed from place to place, dealers who journey from farm to farm, and farm attendants. The virus may be present in garbage used for swine feed but is destroyed by cooking.
Four days to three weeks after exposure, the disease begins with fever. Subsequent signs vary somewhat: loss of appetite, general depression and withdrawal from other animals, reddened and draining eyes, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, and coughing and difficulty in respiration. In many cases a skin rash develops; the mucous membrane of the mouth and throat may become inflamed and ulcerative. The animal lies about, moving reluctantly, sometimes with a staggering gait and an arched back; later it is unable to rise and becomes comatose.
Administration of anti-hog-cholera serum in early stages of the disease may be effective, although recovery is rare. Death may occur within a few days or the illness may become chronic, the animal being a possible source of infection to other pigs.
Hog cholera occurs in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The disease has been eradicated from the United States. In countries in which control has been established, the disease must be reported, infected animals are compulsorily slaughtered, and the premises of sick animals are quarantined. Control is mainly by vaccination.
