Adaptive radiation,  evolution of an animal or plant group into a wide variety of types adapted to specialized modes of life. Adaptive radiations are best exemplified in closely related groups that have evolved in a relatively short time. A striking example is the radiation, beginning in the Paleogene Period (beginning 66 million years ago), of basal mammalian stock into forms adapted to running, leaping, climbing, swimming, and flying. Other examples include Australian marsupials, cichlid fish, and Darwinâ€™s finches (also known as Galapagos finches).
Many examples of speciation by adaptive radiation are found in archipelagoes removed from the mainland. In addition to the Galapagos Islands, the Hawaiian archipelago, with its several volcanic islands and relatively small total land area, hosts an astounding number of plant and animal species that are endemic; that is, they have evolved there and are found nowhere else. More than 90 percent of the native species of Hawaiian flowering plants, land mollusks, birds, and insects are endemic.
