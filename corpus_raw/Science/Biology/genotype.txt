Genotype,   the genetic constitution of an organism. The genotype determines the hereditary potentials and limitations of an individual from embryonic formation through adulthood. Among organisms that reproduce sexually, an individual’s genotype comprises the entire complex of genes inherited from both parents. It can be demonstrated mathematically that sexual reproduction virtually guarantees that each individual will have a unique genotype (except for those individuals, such as identical twins, who are derived from the same fertilized egg).
The actual appearance and behaviour of the individual—i.e., the individual’s phenotype (q.v.)—is determined by the dominance relationships of the alleles that make up the genotype, along with environmental influences.
