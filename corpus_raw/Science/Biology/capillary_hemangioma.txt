Infantile hemangioma,  a congenital benign tumour made up of endothelial cells (the cells lining the inner surface of a blood vessel) that form vascular spaces, which then become filled with blood cells. Infantile hemangiomas are the most commonly occurring tumours in infants and are only rarely associated with medical complications.
Infantile hemangiomas can occur anywhere on the surface of the body, as well as in mucous membranes and in internal organs. The lesions usually range from bright red to dark bluish red and vary in size and shape. They characteristically display rapid growth in the first months of life only to later regress in size and resolve (usually by about age 10).
In rare cases, infantile hemangiomas may interfere with the function of tissues or organs. Those that appear on the eyelid or surface of the eye, for example, may cause a decrease in vision or visual acuity. Likewise, hemangiomas affecting the ear may impair hearing. Segmental hemangiomas, which have an impact on an area of tissue, are sometimes indicative of medically significant underlying congenital abnormalities. Very large hemangiomas may increase blood flow and thereby affect cardiac output.
Treatment is rarely necessary for infantile hemangioma. Growths that threaten vital organs or pose other health risks may be treated with medications (e.g., corticosteroids, propranolol), laser therapy, or surgical excision.
