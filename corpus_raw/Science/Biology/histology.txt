Histology,   branch of biology concerned with the composition and structure of plant and animal tissues in relation to their specialized functions. The terms histology and microscopic anatomy are sometimes used interchangeably, but a fine distinction can be drawn between the two studies. The fundamental aim of histology is to determine how tissues are organized at all structural levels, from cells and intercellular substances to organs. Microscopic anatomy, on the other hand, deals only with tissues as they are arranged in larger entities such as organs and organ systems (e.g., circulatory and reproductive systems).
In their investigations, histologists mainly examine quantities of tissue that have been removed from the living body; these tissues are cut into very thin, almost transparent slices using a special cutting instrument known as a microtome. These thin sections, as they are called, may then be stained with various dyes to increase the contrast between their various cellular components so that the latter can be more easily resolved using an optical microscope. Details of tissue organization that are beyond the resolving power of optical microscopes can be revealed by the electron microscope. Tissues can also be kept alive after their removal from the body by placing them in a suitable culture medium. This method is useful for cultivating (and later examining) certain types of cells and for studying embryonic organ rudiments as they continue to grow and differentiate. A special branch of histology, histochemistry, involves the chemical identification of the various substances in tissues.
