Bainbridge reflex, also called atrial reflex,  acceleration of the heart rate resulting from increased blood pressure in, or increased distension of, the large systemic veins and the right upper chamber of the heart. This reflex, first described by the British physiologist Francis Arthur Bainbridge in 1915, prevents the pooling of blood in the venous system.
Special pressure sensors called baroreceptors (or venoatrial stretch receptors) located in the right atrium of the heart detect increases in the volume and pressure of blood returned to the heart. These receptors transmit information along the vagus nerve (10th cranial nerve) to the central nervous system. This response results in the activation of sympathetic nerve pathways that serve to increase the strength of contraction of the heart muscle and to increase heart rate (tachycardia). The Bainbridge reflex can be blocked by atropine, is diminished or absent when the initial heart rate is high, and can be abolished by cutting the vagus nerves.
