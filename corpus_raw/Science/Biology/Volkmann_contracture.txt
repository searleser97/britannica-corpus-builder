Volkmann contracture,  disorder of the wrist and hand in which the hand and fingers become fixed in a characteristic bent position. The disorder may be caused by the pressure of bandages, a tourniquet, or splints after a fracture; it may also be caused by a severe injury in the region of the elbow. If the cause is not removed promptly, the muscles atrophy and are replaced with fibrous connective tissue.
