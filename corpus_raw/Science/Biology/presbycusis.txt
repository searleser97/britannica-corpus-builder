Presbycusis,   gradual impairment of hearing in old age. Ordinarily it is not experienced until after the age of 60. The affected person notices that he has increasing difficulty in hearing high-pitched sounds and in understanding conversation. There is neither medical nor surgical treatment that can restore hearing loss in uncomplicated presbycusis. There may be other conditions present, however, that impair hearing and are remediable. These include accumulated earwax, middle-ear inflammation, and stirrup fixation, in which one of the tiny bones of the middle ear becomes incapable of transmitting sound vibrations.
