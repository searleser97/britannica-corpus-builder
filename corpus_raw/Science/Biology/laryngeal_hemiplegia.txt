Laryngeal hemiplegia,  in horses, partial or complete paralysis of muscles controlling the vocal fold and other components of the larynx as a result of degeneration of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Laryngeal hemiplegia occurs in all breeds of horses, but mainly in large breeds, and it is probably heritable. Most cases involve paralysis of the left side only, possibly because the nerve on that side is longer. The paralyzed components partially occlude the larynx. During exercise, the increased resistance to airflow during inspiration through the abnormal larynx causes a respiratory noise that is described as a whistling or roaring sound. The affected animal may show a decreased ability to tolerate exercise. Endoscopic examination of laryngeal function immediately after strenuous exercise aids in confirming diagnosis. The condition is incurable, but surgical laryngoplasty may be helpful.
