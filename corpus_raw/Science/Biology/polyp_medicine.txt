Polyp,   in medicine, any growth projecting from the wall of a cavity lined with a mucous membrane. A polyp may have a broad base, in which case it is called sessile; or it may be a pedunculated polyp, i.e., one with a long, narrow neck. The surface of a polyp may be smooth, irregular, or multilobular. The most common locations of polyps in the human body are the nose, the urinary bladder, and the gastrointestinal tract, especially the rectum and colon.
Symptoms of polyps depend upon their location and size. There may be no symptoms, or there may be symptoms resulting from pressure or from mechanical obstruction of all or part of a channel, such as that of the nose or a bowel. Polyps occasionally may bleed. Usually polyps are simple, benign growths, but a small percentage may be either precursors to cancers or may actually contain cancers. For that reason, it is advisable, when possible, to have all polyps removed and examined microscopically.
