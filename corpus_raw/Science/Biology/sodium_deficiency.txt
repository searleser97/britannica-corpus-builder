Sodium deficiency,  condition in which sodium is insufficient or is not utilized properly. Sodium is an element that functions with chlorine and bicarbonate to maintain a balance of positive and negative ions (electrically charged particles) in body fluids and tissues. The body receives sodium primarily in the form of table salt (sodium chloride). Sodium, the principal extracellular ion, has the property of holding water in body tissues. In persons with circulatory problems, excess sodium may result in edema, or retention of water in the body. On the other hand, too little sodium in the diet disturbs the tissue-water and acid-base balance that is important to good nutritional status. Sodium mineral is readily absorbed from the small intestine, and normal storage is accomplished by muscle and cartilage tissue. The hormone aldosterone controls the balance of sodium and water in the body.
The most frequently observed sodium deficiency occurs when excessive heat causes heavy perspiration, thus reducing body water and sodium to the extent that gross dehydration affects normal activity patterns. Symptoms may include feelings of weakness, apathy, and nausea as well as cramps in the muscles of the extremities. Taking additional salt in tablet form is a preventive measure, and persons may use increased amounts of table salt on their food to supplant sodium lost during dehydration and sweating.
