Geographic mosaic theory of coevolution,  in ecology, the theory postulating that the long-term dynamics of coevolution may occur over large geographic ranges rather than within local populations. It is based on the observation that a species may adapt and become specialized to another species differently in separate regions. A species that is involved in an interspecific interaction in one geographic area may not even be present in another geographic area. This geographic mosaic in evolving interactions provides the raw material for the overall direction of coevolution, which proceeds as genes that are favoured in local interactions spread out into other populations.
Some local populations may contribute little to the overall direction of coevolution between two or more species, whereas other populations may be crucial to the process. A highly virulent form of a parasite that recently has been introduced into a local population may cause the extinction of its host population, thereby causing its own extinction. In another population the evolution of a powerful host resistance gene may cause the local extinction of the parasite population. In still other populations the two species may continue to coexist but coevolve in different ways. Over a long period some adaptations in these populations will spread to other populations and influence the overall direction of coevolution between the parasite and host species. Similar geographic differences in interactions are known to occur between predators and prey and between competitors and mutualists.
For some forms of coevolution to occur at a geographic level, many populations of the interacting species must be maintained on a local scale (metapopulations) as well as across broader geographic ranges. Should a species be reduced to a few populations, the geographic mosaic of diverse adaptations that fuels the coevolutionary process is diminished.
