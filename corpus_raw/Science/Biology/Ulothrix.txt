Ulothrix,  genus of filamentous green algae (family Ulotrichaceae) found in marine and fresh waters. Each cell contains a distinct nucleus, a central vacuole, and a large thin chloroplast with at least one pyrenoid. The specialized cell for attachment is called the holdfast, and the filaments are typically unbranched. In most species, all the cells can form reproductive bodies. Ulothrix reproduces vegetatively by fragmentation, asexually by nonmotile resting spores (aplanospores) and motile quadriflagellate spores (zoospores), and sexually by biflagellate gametes.
