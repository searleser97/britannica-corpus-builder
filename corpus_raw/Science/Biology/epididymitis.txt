Epididymitis,  inflammation of the epididymis, the cordlike structure that runs along the posterior of the testis (testicle) and contains spermatozoa. In young men, epididymitis is most often caused by sexually transmitted agents such as Chlamydia and gonococcus, while in older men it is more likely to occur sporadicallyâ€”e.g., from intestinal bacteria that gain access to the bloodstream and then spread to the epididymis, or following diagnostic or surgical procedures. Epididymitis in young boys may be an indication of anatomical or urological abnormalities. Symptoms of epididymitis include pain and swelling of the epididymis and sometimes of the scrotum, possibly accompanied by fever and urethral discharge. When severe, epididymitis can spread to the adjacent testis. It is treated with antibiotics.
