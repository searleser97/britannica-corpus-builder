Biogenetic law, also called Recapitulation Theory,  postulation, by Ernst Haeckel in 1866, that ontogeny recapitulates phylogenyâ€”i.e., the development of the animal embryo and young traces the evolutionary development of the species. The theory was influential and much-popularized earlier but has been of little significance in elucidating either evolution or embryonic growth.
