Hypercalcitoninemia,  abnormally high blood concentrations of calcitonin, a protein hormone secreted by parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland. In humans and other mammals, the condition is often indicative of a nutritional disorder or a thyroid disorder. In humans, hypercalcitoninemia is most frequently associated with medullary thyroid carcinomas, which are tumours of the parafollicular cells. Hypercalcitoninemia may also occur as a side effect of certain drugs, including beta-blockers, which are agents commonly used in the treatment of heart failure, and omeprazole, which is a proton-pump inhibitor used in the treatment of peptic ulcer.
