Telosporidian,  any spore-forming protozoan of the class Telospora (sometimes called Telosporida), characterized by naked or encapsulated spores and no polar capsules. The life cycle typically alternates between asexual and sexual phases; the latter produces infective stages (sporozoites) in which the parasites are usually transferred to new hosts. The sporozoite undergoes a period of multiple division before it produces gametes that unite sexually to form spores.
