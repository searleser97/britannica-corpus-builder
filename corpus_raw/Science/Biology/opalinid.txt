Opalinid,   (subphylum Opalinata), any of about 150 protozoans found in the intestinal tracts of amphibians and some other animals. The nuclei of opalinids vary in number from two (e.g., Zelleriella) to many (e.g., Cepedea); the locomotor organelles (short, hairlike projections) are arranged in slanting, longitudinal rows. Species of the genus Opalina range from 90 to 500 micrometres in length. Reproduction is sexual by fusion of gametes (syngamy) or asexual by longitudinal splitting with distribution of the nuclei. Opalinids inhabit the intestines of amphibians (e.g., salamanders, newts) and some reptiles and fishes. They do not harm their host. Distribution is by encystment after reproduction; the cyst escapes in host feces and is ingested by another host. Opalinids are found worldwide, although species vary with location. One species, Zelleriella opisthocarya, is itself parasitized by another protozoan, Entamoeba paulista.
The taxonomic position of opalinids is uncertain, and they have been variously classified. Formerly considered a separate group, they were called Protociliata, but any close relationship to contemporary ciliate groups is now considered doubtful.
