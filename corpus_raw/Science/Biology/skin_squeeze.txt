Skin squeeze, also called body squeeze,  effect on the skin of exposure to a pressure less than that of the surrounding environmental pressure. Skin squeeze is most prevalent among pilots and underwater divers working in pressurized suits. In both professions the participants encounter unusual pressures.
In deep-sea diving, especially when the diver is using a pressurized suit and metal helmet supplied with air from the surface, the hazard of body squeeze is common. As a diver goes to underwater depths, the external pressure upon the body increases in proportion to the depth. To prevent injury to the skin and body, the pressure of the air pumped into the suit must at all times be equal to that of the surrounding water. If the air pressure is less inside the suit than the water pressure, the effect is that of a partial vacuum that pulls the body’s tissues outward. This vacuum effect causes rupturing of the skin’s blood vessels. Pain, tenderness, redness, and swelling of the tissue result. If the vacuum is sufficiently great, the body of the diver may be crushed and sucked up into the helmet. Most cases of skin squeeze occur when there is a blockage in the air hose or malfunction of the air valve so that the pressures cannot be equalized. A diver who falls while under water, so that he or she descends rapidly before the air pressure in the suit can be adjusted, also is subject to body squeeze.
Pilots using pressurized suits can encounter the same difficulties as divers. As one goes higher into space, the external pressure decreases. Upon return to land, the pressure gradually increases once again. If a pressurized suit malfunctions at high altitudes, the pilot can encounter skin squeeze upon descent toward the Earth.
