Colic,  in horses, any of a number of disease conditions that are associated with clinical signs of abdominal pain. Horses are especially susceptible to colic related to digestive tract problems, and death occurs in about 11 percent of affected animals. Signs include pawing the ground, kicking at the abdomen, and rolling from side to side. Anatomical features of the equine digestive tract such as marked variations in the diameter of the large colon and limited attachment of the large colon to the body wall predispose the horse to colic by increasing the potential for blockage of the digestive tract with ingested material (impaction) and twisting of the tract. Dietary changes are a significant factor influencing incidence of colic. More than 70 causes of colic have been identified, which makes it difficult to determine the cause in individual cases. Treatment may involve use of drugs for pain relief, oral administration of mineral oil to soften impaction, and surgery.
