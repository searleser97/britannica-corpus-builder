Boutonneuse fever, French fièvre boutonneuse, or fièvre exanthématique,  a mild typhuslike fever caused by the bacterium Rickettsia conorii and transmitted by ticks, occurring in most of the Mediterranean countries and Crimea. Available evidence suggests that the diseases described as Kenya typhus and South African tick-bite fever are probably identical with boutonneuse fever although conveyed by a different species of tick.
Primarily, the carrier was found to be a brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus; subsequently, other ticks were incriminated. The reservoir probably exists in nature in the lower animals, but the dog is apparently a major source of infection. The course of the disease is somewhat similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but it is milder. The case fatality rate is under 3 percent. A primary lesion, or tâche noire (“black spot”), is often found at the site of the infecting tick bite and, therefore, on any part of the body, but it is usually on a part covered by clothing.
