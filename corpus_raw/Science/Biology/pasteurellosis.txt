Pasteurellosis,  any bacterial disease caused by Pasteurella species. The name is sometimes used interchangeably with the so-called shipping fever, a specific type of pasteurellosis (caused by Pasteurella multocida) that commonly attacks cattle under stress, as during shipping. In this type of pasteurellosis, fever is followed by respiratory difficulty, which may lead to pneumonia and more severe symptoms. Treatment includes isolation, rest, and antibiotic therapy. Some immunity may be gained from antiserums and other preventive preparations. P. haemolytica, another organism that causes pasteurellosis, can produce pneumonia in sheep and cattle and septicemia in other animals.
