Kell blood group system,  classification of human blood based on the presence on the surfaces of red blood cells of various antigens encoded by the KEL gene. The system, discovered in 1946, is characterized by a high degree of polymorphism (genetic variation), and thus studies of the Kell antigens have provided insight into the development of polymorphic traits in the context of human evolution. Antibodies generated against antigens in the Kell system can cause transfusion reactions and erythroblastosis fetalis; after the Rh and ABO systems, the Kell system is the third most common blood group to cause these reactions.
In total, there are 25 Kell antigens, all of which are encoded by the KEL gene. The two primary, codominant alleles of the KEL gene include K and k, which encode the K (Kell) and k (Cellano) antigens, respectively. The k antigen is common, occurring in more than 90 percent of blacks and whites. Polymorphisms in the KEL gene give rise to different antigens, including the Jsa and Jsb antigens. The Jsb antigen is found in 100 percent of whites and 80 percent of blacks. Examples of other Kell antigens include Kpa (Penney) and Kpb (Rautenberg).
Kell antigens normally associate with a protein called Kx on the surfaces of red blood cells. In some people, the Kx protein is absent, resulting in McLeod syndrome. Characteristics of this syndrome include acanthocytosis (thorny projections on red blood cells) and reduced Kell antigen expression. These abnormalities often lead to defects in muscle and nerve function that manifest as disordered movement, psychological disturbance, and loss of reflexes.
