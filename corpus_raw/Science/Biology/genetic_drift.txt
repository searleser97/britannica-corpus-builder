Genetic drift, also called genetic sampling error or Sewall Wright effect,  a change in the gene pool of a small population that takes place strictly by chance. Genetic drift can result in genetic traits being lost from a population or becoming widespread in a population without respect to the survival or reproductive value of the alleles involved. A random statistical effect, genetic drift can occur only in small, isolated populations in which the gene pool is small enough that chance events can change its makeup substantially. In larger populations, any specific allele is carried by so many individuals that it is almost certain to be transmitted by some of them unless it is biologically unfavourable.
Genetic drift is based on the fact that a subsample (i.e., small, isolated population) that is derived from a large sample set (i.e., large population) is not necessarily representative of the larger set. As might be expected, the smaller the population, the greater the chance of sampling error (or misrepresentation of the larger population) and hence of significant levels of drift in any one generation. In extreme cases, drift over the generations can result in the complete loss of one allele in an allele pair; the remaining allele is then said to be fixed.
