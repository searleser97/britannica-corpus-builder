Shellfish poisoning,   illness in humans resulting from the eating of certain mussels and clams. The source of the poison has been traced to the plankton upon which shellfish feed during parts of the year. Symptoms often begin within 10 minutes after eating the shellfish. Initially, there is tingling and numbness about the lips and prickly feelings in the fingertips. The throat is often dry. Staggering, giddiness, and muscular incoordination may appear, and speech is often incoherent. In severe cases, respiratory paralysis and death soon follow; mechanical respiratory aids and tracheotomy (surgical creation of an airway through an opening in the neck) may be lifesaving. If the individual survives the first 12 hours of illness, the chances for complete recovery are good. See also fish poisoning.
