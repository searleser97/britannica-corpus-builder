Dupuytren’s contracture,   flexion deformity of the hands caused by thickening of the fascia, or fibrous connective tissue, of the palm. The proliferation of connective tissue causes the tendons of one or more fingers to shorten and tighten, leaving the finger permanently flexed. Disability may be as slight as inability to extend the ring finger completely or as severe as complete curling of the hand into a closed fist. The contracture does not affect neighbouring nerves and other structures. Dupuytren’s contracture may be inherited or may occur as a symptom of scleroderma or rheumatoid arthritis. In some severe cases, incision and removal of some of the connective tissue may release the contracture.
