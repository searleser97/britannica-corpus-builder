Sartorius muscle,  (from the Latin sartor, “mender”), long, narrow, ribbonlike thigh muscle beginning at the front of the crest of the pelvic girdle, extending obliquely down the front and side of the thigh, and inserted at (attached to) the inner and upper portion of the tibia (shinbone). It received its name because it is especially useful in assuming the cross-legged position that ancient tailors used in their work.
Action includes flexion of the thigh and of the leg at the knee and outward rotation of the femur (thighbone).
