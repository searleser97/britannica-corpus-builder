Urinary bladder,   in most vertebrates, except birds, organ for the temporary storage of urine from the kidneys, connected to the kidneys by means of tubular structures called ureters. A urinary bladder is present in fish as an expansible part of the urinary duct, in amphibians and bladder-possessing reptiles (Sphenodon, turtles, most lizards) as a pocket in the cloaca. In mammals it is a greatly expandible muscular sac. The bladder of an average adult human is uncomfortably distended at a volume of around 350 millilitres (1/3 quart) of urine.
In placental mammals a special duct, the urethra, leads from the urinary bladder to the exterior; it fulfills the excretory function of the more primitive cloaca. In females the urethra is separate from the genital tract. In males the vas deferens (sperm-carrying tubes) empty into the urethra, and both urine and semen pass through the urethra to reach the exterior.
