Alternation of generations, also called metagenesis or heterogenesis,  in biology, the alternation of a sexual phase and an asexual phase in the life cycle of an organism. The two phases, or generations, are often morphologically, and sometimes chromosomally, distinct.
In algae, fungi, and plants, alternation of generations is common. It is not always easy to observe, however, since one or the other of the generations is often very small, even microscopic. The sexual phase, called the gametophyte generation, produces gametes, or sex cells, and the asexual phase, or sporophyte generation, produces spores asexually. In terms of chromosomes, the gametophyte is haploid (has a single set of chromosomes), and the sporophyte is diploid (has a double set). In bryophytes, such as mosses and liverworts, the gametophyte is the dominant life phase, whereas in angiosperms and gymnosperms the sporophyte is dominant. The haploid phase is also dominant among fungi. Although some algae have determinate life cycle stages, many species alternate between the sexual and asexual phases in response to environmental conditions.
Among animals, many invertebrates have an alternation of sexual and asexual generations (e.g., protozoans, jellyfish, flatworms), but the alternation of haploid and diploid generations is unknown.
