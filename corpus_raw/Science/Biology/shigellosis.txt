Shigellosis, also known as bacillary dysentery,  infection of the gastrointestinal tract by bacteria of the genus Shigella. The illness produces cramplike abdominal pain as well as diarrhea consisting of either watery stools or scant stools containing mucus and blood.
Shigellosis occurs throughout the world, especially where overcrowding is a problem and personal hygiene is poor. Very few organisms are needed to cause the disease, and they survive well on fomites (inanimate objects, such as clothing, that can convey infection). In addition, humans may be carriers.
Diagnosis of shigellosis is made by stool cultures. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics shortens the duration of the illness and eliminates the Shigella organism from the stool, thereby limiting further transmission of the disease. See also dysentery.
