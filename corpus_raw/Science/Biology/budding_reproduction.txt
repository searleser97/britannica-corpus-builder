Budding,   in biology, a form of asexual reproduction in which a new individual develops from some generative anatomical point of the parent organism. In some species buds may be produced from almost any point of the body, but in many cases budding is restricted to specialized areas. The initial protuberance of proliferating cytoplasm or cells, the bud, eventually develops into an organism duplicating the parent. The new individual may separate to exist independently, or the buds may remain attached, forming aggregates or colonies. Budding is characteristic of a few unicellular organisms (e.g., certain bacteria, yeasts, and protozoans). However, a number of metazoan animals (e.g., certain cnidarian species) regularly reproduce by budding.
In horticulture the term budding refers to a method of plant propagation in which a bud of the plant to be propagated is grafted onto the stem of another plant.
