Vesicular exanthema of swine,  viral disease of swine causing eruption of painful blisters on feet and snout. Blisters emerge 24 to 72 hours after exposure and are accompanied by fever, which lasts 24 to 36 hours and may occur again after two or three days.
The signs resemble those of foot-and-mouth disease and vesicular stomatitis, thus creating a problem of diagnosis. Control programs include quarantine, elimination of infected animals, cleaning and disinfecting contaminated areas, and cooking garbage used for swine feed. After a major outbreak in the United States beginning in 1939, the disease was the object of a nationwide campaign and was officially declared eradicated there in 1959. It has not been reported in pigs in other countries. However, one or more serotypes of the vesicular exanthema of swine virus exist in other species, including sea lions and fish, and at least one of these serotypes has been demonstrated to cause signs of disease when inoculated into swine.
