Pure culture,    in microbiology, a laboratory culture containing a single species of organism. A pure culture is usually derived from a mixed culture (one containing many species) by transferring a small sample into new, sterile growth medium in such a manner as to disperse the individual cells across the medium surface or by thinning the sample manyfold before inoculating the new medium. Both methods separate the individual cells so that, when they multiply, each will form a discrete colony, which may then be used to inoculate more medium, with the assurance that only one type of organism will be present. Isolation of a pure culture may be enhanced by providing a mixed inoculum with a medium favouring the growth of one organism to the exclusion of others.
