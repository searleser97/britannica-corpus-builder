Induction,   in embryology, process by which the presence of one tissue influences the development of others. Certain tissues, especially in very young embryos, apparently have the potential to direct the differentiation of adjacent cells. Absence of the inducing tissue results in lack of or improper development of the induced tissue. The converse is often true as well; i.e., the addition of extra inducing tissue in an abnormal position in an embryo often results in aberrantly located induced tissue.
An example of induction is the development of the eye lens from epidermis under influence of the eye cup, which grows toward the skin from the brain. As the eye cup comes into contact with any neighbouring epidermis, it transforms that particular region into a lens. The exact nature of the stimulus for lens induction is not known, although ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been implicated as a messenger.
The range of the inductive effect is not unlimited, for only certain tissues are capable of being induced by a given structure and then only at certain times.
