larva, plural larvae, or larvas,  stage in the development of many animals, occurring after birth or hatching and before the adult form is reached. These immature, active forms are structurally different from the adults and are adapted to a different environment.
In some species the larva is free-living and the adult is an attached or nonmobile form; in others the larva is aquatic and the adult lives on land. In forms with nonmobile adults, the mobile larva increases the geographic distribution of the species. Such larvae have well-developed locomotor structures. A larva sometimes functions as a food gatherer—in many species the larval stage occurs at a time when food is abundant—and has a well-developed alimentary system. It stores food so that the transformation to the adult stage can occur. Some larvae function in both dispersion and nutrition.
The amount of time in the life cycle spent in the larval stage varies among species. Some have long larval periods, either hatching early, metamorphosing into adults late, or both. Some organisms have a short-lived larval phase or no larvae at all.
Larvae appear in a variety of forms. Many invertebrates (e.g., cnidarians) have a simple ciliated larva called a planula. Flukes have several larval stages, and annelids, mollusks, and crustaceans have various larval forms. The larval forms of the various insects are called caterpillars, grubs, maggots, and nymphs. Echinoderms (e.g., starfish) also have larval forms. The larva of the frog is called a tadpole.
