Rhinophyma,  extensive overgrowth of the lower part of the nose. The sebaceous (oil-producing) glands seem to be the site of origin. Growth is characteristic of a nodular, or many-lobed, mass. There is overgrowth of the glands, expansion of the ducts, an extensive blood supply, inflammatory fluids, and a progressive replacement of the degenerated tissue with fibrous scar tissue. The mass is benign but sometimes large and disfiguring.
