Aqueous humour,  optically clear, slightly alkaline liquid that occupies the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye (the space in front of the iris and lens and the ringlike space encircling the lens). The aqueous humour resembles blood plasma in composition but contains less protein and glucose and more lactic acid and ascorbic acid. It provides these nutrients (as well as oxygen) to eye tissues that lack a direct blood supply (such as the lens) and also removes their waste products. In addition, it provides an internal pressure, known as intraocular pressure, that keeps the eyeball (globe) properly formed. Aqueous humour is formed from the blood by filtration, secretion, and diffusion through the ciliary body, a muscular structure located behind the iris that controls the curvature of the lens. Aqueous humour leaves the eye through the porous trabecular meshwork and flows into Schlemmâ€™s canal, a ringlike passageway around the outer angle of the anterior chamber in front of the iris. From the canal the liquid enters the veins.
When the aqueous humour does not adequately drain from the eye, intraocular pressure can rise and loss of vision can result. Elevated eye pressures can contribute to the onset of many types of glaucoma, a common vision-threatening group of diseases. Therapies for glaucoma are aimed at lowering eye pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous humour from the eye and decreasing its production by the ciliary body. Two types of surgery that increase outflow of fluid from the eye include trabeculoplasty, a type of laser surgery that increases the permeability of the trabecular meshwork, and trabeculectomy (also called filtering microsurgery). Trabeculectomy diverts aqueous humour from the anterior chamber inside the eye to the space under the conjunctiva (the transparent skin that covers the white area, or sclera, of the eye).
