Alkalosis,  abnormally low level of acidity, or high level of alkalinity, in the body fluids, including the blood. Alkalosis may be either metabolic or respiratory in origin. Metabolic alkalosis results from either acid loss (which may be caused by severe vomiting or by the use of potent diuretics [substances that promote production of urine]) or bicarbonate gain (which may be caused by excessive intake of bicarbonate or by the depletion of body fluid volume). Respiratory alkalosis results from hyperventilation, which is often caused by anxiety. Hyperventilation may also be caused by asthma, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia. Compare acidosis.
