Hymenium,  a spore-bearing layer of tissue in fungi (kingdom Fungi) found in the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. It is formed by end cells of hyphae—the filaments of the vegetative body (thallus)—which terminate elongation and differentiate into reproductive cells. The hymenium may also contain support cells known as cystidia.
