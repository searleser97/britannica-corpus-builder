Gymnodinium,  genus of marine or freshwater dinoflagellate algae (family Gymnodiniaceae). Like all dinoflagellates, members of the genus feature two flagella and have both plantlike and animal-like characteristics. Some may be bioluminescent or form periodic water blooms that may colour water yellow or red. A few species produce a toxin similar to that of the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax; both toxins are fatal to fish and can irritate the nose and throat of humans if inhaled.
Members of the genus are usually bilaterally symmetrical with a delicate pellicle (envelope) and lack the cellulosic armour of other dinoflagellate species. Many have disk-shaped chromatophores, which contain yellow, brown, green, or blue pigments. Some species are photosynthetic, whereas others are heterotrophic and require solid food. Colonial species form long chains. Sexual reproduction often results in hypnozygotes (thick-walled resting cysts) that can remain dormant in mud and other sediments until conditions are favourable for growth. Asexual reproduction is primarily through binary fission.
