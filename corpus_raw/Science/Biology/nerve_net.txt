Nerve net,  primitive nerve arrangement forming the entire nervous system of many cnidarians and a part of more advanced nervous systems. Cytoplasmic processes join the nerve cells (neurons) of nerve nets. In cnidarians the neurons are joined to epithelial receptors and to contractile cells. In vertebrates, nerve nets may be found around blood vessels and the alimentary tract.
