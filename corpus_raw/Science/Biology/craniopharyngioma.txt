Craniopharyngioma,  benign brain tumour arising from the pituitary gland. Although most common in children, it can occur at any age. As it grows, the tumour may compress the optic nerve and other nearby structures, causing loss of vision, headaches, vomiting, behavioral changes, endocrine disorders, and sometimes loss of the sense of smell. Surgical removal of the tumour is often necessary.
