Fibroma,  any benign tumour of fibrous tissue. Specific fibromas include nonossifying fibroma, found in the large long bones; it is relatively common in older children and young adults. Fibromas can occur in many areas of the body (e.g., ovaries, nerves) and may remain symptomless throughout life. Treatment includes surgical excision of the tumour.
