Neural crest,   group of embryonic cells that are pinched off during the formation of the neural tube (the precursor of the spinal cord) but that do not remain as a part of the central nervous system. The cells of the neural crest migrate to numerous locations in the body and contribute to the formation of diverse structures, mostly associated with the nervous system. The factors determining their migration and differentiation are not known.
The most conspicuous of the neural crest derivatives are the melanocytes, cells in the deep layers of the epidermis that contain pigment and are responsible for skin coloration. In the head region the neural crest cells contribute significantly to the formation of the facial bones. Odontoblasts, the cells that give rise to the dentine of the teeth, have their origin in the neural crest, as do many of the cranial nerve cells. The neural crest also contributes to the formation of the meningeal covering of the brain and is the source of Schwann cells, which surround and insulate nerve fibres in the peripheral nervous system. In addition to Schwann cells and melanocytes, the neural crest of the trunk region gives rise to paired chains of sympathetic nerve ganglia and to certain cells of the adrenal gland.
