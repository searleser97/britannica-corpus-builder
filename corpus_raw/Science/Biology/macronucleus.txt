Macronucleus,   relatively large nucleus believed to influence many cell activities. It occurs in suctorian and ciliate protozoans (e.g., Paramecium). The macronucleus is associated with one or more smaller micronuclei, which are necessary for conjugation and autogamy (reproduction by exchange between the nuclei of different individuals and of the same individuals, respectively). When these reproductive processes occur, the macronucleus degenerates. It is re-formed from nuclear material in the zygote.
