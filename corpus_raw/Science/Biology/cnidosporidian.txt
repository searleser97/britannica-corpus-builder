Cnidosporidian,  any protozoan parasite of the subphylum Cnidospora. The approximately 1,100 known species are characterized by walled spores with one to four hollow polar filaments. The spore has a multicellular originâ€”i.e., the cells that produce the spore capsule and the polar filaments before they degenerate may be considered somatic cells with specific functions. Observations indicate that the polar filament is a hollow tube through which the sporoplasm, the infective stage, travels from the spore to a tissue cell of the host where it grows into a plasmodium (a mass of cytoplasm with many nuclei).
This group is divided into four subgroups; Helicosporida, insect parasites (see Helicosporidium); Actinomyxida, worm parasites (see actinomyxidian); Microsporida, parasites of arthropods including insects (see microsporidian); and Myxosporida, fish parasites (see myxosporidian).
