Prolapse,  a downward protrusion of an internal organ out of its normal cavity. The term is usually applied to protrusion of the rectum or of the uterus outside the body. In either case, the prolapse follows progressive weakening of the muscles, ligaments, and other supporting tissues around the organ.
Rectal prolapse, in which the membrane that lines the rectum protrudes through the anus, occurs frequently in elderly people with a history of constipation and straining during bowel movements. Prolapse of the uterus into the vagina is usually a delayed reaction to childbirth injuries that created a weakness that is increased by gravitational forces. Sudden increases in intra-abdominal pressure that may be produced by coughing, sneezing, or bowel movements may then force the rectal or uterine tissue out through the adjacent opening.
Rectal prolapse is often temporary at first but may eventually become chronic with continued straining, requiring surgical repair. Although mild uterine prolapse can be relieved by temporary artificial supports and exercises to strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor, severe prolapse that causes vaginal discomfort and impedes walking often must be treated by hysterectomy.
