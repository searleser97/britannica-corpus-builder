Hookworm disease, also called ancylostomiasis, or uncinariasis,  a parasitic infestation of humans, dogs, or cats caused by bloodsucking worms (see photograph) living in the small intestineâ€”sometimes associated with secondary anemia. Several species of hookworm can cause the disease. Necator americanus, which ranges in size from 5 to 11 millimetres (0.2 to 0.4 inch), is responsible for about 90 percent of human hookworm infections that occur in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Ancylostoma duodenale, 8 to 13 millimetres long, is found on all continents but is most prevalent in warm regions. A. braziliense, from 8 to 11 millimetres long, is normally parasitic in dogs and cats; man, however, is sometimes infected by this species in the southern United States, South America, and Asia. A. ceylanicum, normally parasitic in dogs, is sometimes found in man in South America and Asia. A. duodenale, possesses four hooklike teeth in its adult stage, and N. americanus has plates in its mouth rather than teeth.
Both species of hookworm have similar life cycles. The adult worm attaches itself to the mucosal tissue lining the small intestine, where the female may produce several thousands eggs a day, which are passed in the feces. If the fecal matter reaches suitable soil, the eggs are hatched, and the infective, threadlike larvae may penetrate human skin, usually that of the foot, by way of the sweat glands and hair follicles. They then invade the lymph and blood vessels, reach the lungs, and pass up the respiratory tree to reach the mouth, where they are swallowed and sent to the small intestine; there they mature and start a new reproductive cycle. The intestinal parasites are reputedly long-lived, with a lifetime that may span some 10 years.
The symptoms of hookworm disease ordinarily begin with ground itch, an itchy skin irritation caused by the larvae when they penetrate the skin and marked by papules and vesicles that are often located between the toes. In passing through the lungs, the larvae may produce coughing and fever. In the intestine, the mature worm sustains its life by bloodsucking, and persistent feeding by many worms over many years results in secondary anemia.
In heavy infestations (which may involve more than 500 larvae), the general symptoms include pallor of the skin and mucous membranes, fluid retention in the face and extremities, constipation alternating with diarrhea, abdominal tenderness, increased appetite for bulky or strange substances (e.g., clay), delayed puberty and stunted growth, fatigue, dullness, and apathy. Hookworm infestation tends to be constantly widespread in tropical and subtropical regions of the world; moisture, warmth, loose soil, promiscuous defecation, and absence of shoes are the chief factors responsible for infection. One single oral dose of tetrachlorethylene on an empty stomach will remove about 90 percent of the Necator. Bephenium hydroxynaphthoate is especially effective against Ancylostoma. Iron supplements and a diet high in protein will speed recovery. Immediate prognosis is good, but the likelihood of reinfection constitutes a major health problem. Periodic mass treatment of the population has been used in some hookworm control programs. The prevention of hookworm disease consists of ensuring the sanitary disposal of human excreta.
