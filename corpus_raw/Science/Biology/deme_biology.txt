Deme,  in biology, a population of organisms within which the exchange of genes is completely random; i.e., all mating combinations between individuals of opposite sexes have the same probability of occurrence. The deme usually is not a closed population but contributes individuals to neighbouring populations and receives immigrants from them.
The concept was invoked most notably by American geneticist Sewall Wright in his shifting balance theory, in which he proposed that the processes of adaptation, natural selection, and genetic drift allowed for the evolution of novelty (e.g., speciation) in environments where change is constant.
