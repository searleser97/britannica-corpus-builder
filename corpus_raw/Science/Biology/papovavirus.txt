Papovavirus,  any virus in the families Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae. Papovaviruses are responsible for a variety of abnormal growths in animals: warts (papillomas) in humans, dogs, and other animals; cervical cancer in women; tumours (polyomas) in mice; and vacuoles (open areas) in cells of monkeys.
The virus particle (virion) is about 45 nm (1 nm=10âˆ’9 metre) in diameter. The outer surface of the capsid (the protein shell surrounding the viral nucleic acids) is icosahedral and is composed of 72 capsomeres (capsid subunits). The capsid contains double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Papovaviruses develop in the nuclei of cells, in which they can be seen in apparent crystalline arrangements.
