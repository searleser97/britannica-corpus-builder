Poxvirus,  (family Poxviridae),  any of a group of viruses constituting the family Poxviridae, responsible for a wide range of pox diseases in humans and other animals. In humans, variola major and variola minor isolates of the poxvirus species Variola virus were the cause of smallpox, which was declared eradicated worldwide in 1980 by the World Health Organization. (Chicken pox of humans is caused by a herpesvirus; see herpes zoster.)
The virus particle is somewhat brick-shaped, with the longest dimension as much as 250–300 nanometres (1 nanometre = 10−9 metre). It is surface-studded with hollow spikes and contains deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Unlike other DNA-viruses, poxviruses appear to develop entirely within the cytoplasm of affected cells. The virus of rabbit pox, or infectious myxomatosis, has been used with mixed success in Australia to control the wild rabbit population.
