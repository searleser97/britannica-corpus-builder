Zooplankton,  small floating or weakly swimming organisms that drift with water currents and, with phytoplankton, make up the planktonic food supply upon which almost all oceanic organisms are ultimately dependent. Many animals, from single-celled Radiolaria to the eggs or larvae of herrings, crabs, and lobsters, are found among the zooplankton. Permanent plankton, or holoplankton, such as protozoa and copepods (an important food for larger animals), spend their lives as plankton. Temporary plankton, or meroplankton, such as young starfish, clams, worms, and other bottom-dwelling animals, live and feed as plankton until they leave to become adults in their proper habitats.
