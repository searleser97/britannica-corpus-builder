Heart disease,  any disorder of the heart. Examples include coronary heart disease, congenital heart disease, and pulmonary heart disease, as well as rheumatic heart disease (see rheumatic fever), hypertension, inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of its inner or outer membrane (endocarditis, pericarditis), and heart valve disease. Abnormalities of the heartâ€™s natural pacemaker or of the nerves that conduct its impulses cause arrhythmias. Some connective tissue diseases (notably systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma) can affect the heart. Heart failure may result from many of these disorders.
