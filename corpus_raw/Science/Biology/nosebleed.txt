Nosebleed, also called Epistaxis,  an attack of bleeding from the nose. It is a common and usually unimportant disorder but may also result from local conditions of inflammation, small ulcers or polypoid growths, or severe injuries to the skull. Vascular disease, such as high blood pressure, may provoke it, and such diseases as scurvy and hemophilia also may be responsible. Usually it is easily controlled by rest and application of cold and pressure. On occasion it may require expert care.
