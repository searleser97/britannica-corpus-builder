Calicivirus,  any virus belonging to the family Caliciviridae. Caliciviruses have nonenveloped virions (virus particles) that are about 35–39 nm (1 nm = 10−9 metre) in diameter. They are icosahedral, with capsids (the protein shell surrounding the viral nucleic acids) composed of 32 capsomeres (capsid subunits) comprising 180 molecules of a single capsid protein. The calicivirus genome consists of single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ribonucleic acid).
Caliciviridae contains four genera: Lagovirus, Vesivirus, Sapovirus, and Norovirus (Norwalk-like viruses). Type species of this family include Vesicular exanthema of swine virus, Norwalk virus, and Sapporo virus. Species of Norovirus frequently give rise to outbreaks of foodborne and waterborne gastroenteritis in humans. Feline calicivirus (FCV) is an agent that causes upper respiratory disease in cats.
