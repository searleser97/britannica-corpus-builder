Sea lettuce,  (genus Ulva),  genus of green algae (family Ulvaceae) usually found growing on rocky shores of seas and oceans around the world. Some species also grow in brackish water rich in organic matter or sewage and can accumulate heavy metals. Sea lettuce, particularly Ulva lactuca, is rich in iodine and in vitamins A, B, and C and is used in salads and soups in parts of northern Europe, Japan, and China.
The thallus, which somewhat resembles a lettuce leaf, is a sheet of cells up to 30 cm (12 inches) long and two cells thick and is embedded in a tough gelatinous sheath. The holdfast, which anchors the alga to its substrate, is disklike. The life cycle consists of alternation of similar spore-producing (diploid) and gamete-producing (haploid) generations. Asexual reproduction is typically by accidental fragmentation.
