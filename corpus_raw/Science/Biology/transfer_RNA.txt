Transfer RNA (tRNA),  small molecule in cells that carries amino acids to organelles called ribosomes, where they are linked into proteins. In addition to tRNA there are two other major types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). By 1960 the involvement of tRNAs in the assembly of proteins was demonstrated by several scientists, including American biochemist Robert William Holley, who also developed techniques to separate different transfer RNAs from cells and determined the composition of the tRNA that incorporates the amino acid alanine into protein molecules.
Ribosomal molecules of mRNA determine the order of tRNA molecules that are bound to nucleotide triplets (codons). The order of tRNA molecules ultimately determines the amino acid sequence of a protein because molecules of tRNA catalyze the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids, linking them together to form proteins. The newly formed proteins detach themselves from the ribosome site and migrate to other parts of the cell for use.
Molecules of tRNA typically contain fewer than 100 nucleotide units and fold into a characteristic cloverleaf structure. Specialized tRNAs exist for each of the 20 amino acids needed for protein synthesis, and in many cases more than one tRNA for each amino acid is present. The 61 codons used to code amino acids can be read by many fewer than 61 distinct tRNAs. In the bacterium Escherichia coli a total of 40 different tRNAs are used to translate the 61 codons. The amino acids are loaded onto the tRNAs by specialized enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, usually with one synthetase for each amino acid. However, in some organisms, less than the full complement of 20 synthetases are required because some amino acids, such as glutamine and asparagine, can be synthesized on their respective tRNAs. All tRNAs adopt similar structures because they all have to interact with the same sites on the ribosome.
