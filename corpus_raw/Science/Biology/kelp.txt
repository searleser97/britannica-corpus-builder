Kelp,  (order Laminariales),  any of about 30 genera of brown algae that grow as large coastal seaweeds in colder seas. Kelps provide critical habitat and are an important food source for a wide range of coastal organisms, including many fish and invertebrates. Until early in the 19th century, the ash of such seaweeds was an important source of potash and iodine. Many kelps produce algin, a complex carbohydrate (polysaccharide) useful in various industrial processes, including tire manufacture. Algin is added to ice cream before freezing to prevent ice crystallization and is also used as a suspending and emulsifying agent in other food products.
Sometimes known as tangles, kelps of the genus Laminaria have long flat blades and are primarily found in northern coastal regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. These abundant kelps can be 1–3 metres (3.3–9.8 feet) long and have a stipe that superficially resembles the stem of land plants. Growth extension occurs at the meristematic region between the stipe (which is perennial) and the blade (which is shed annually).
Giant kelps of the genus Macrocystis are the largest known kelp species, reaching up to 65 metres (215 feet) long. The genus is limited in distribution because it reproduces only at temperatures below 18–20 °C (64.4–68 °F). The complicated body, in some ways similar in appearance to that of higher plants, has a large rootlike holdfast for attachment to the ocean floor, a stemlike stipe for the internal transport of organic material, and long branching stalks with blades that stay afloat by means of gas bladders.
Members of the genus Nereocystis, commonly called bull kelps, are annual kelps that grow primarily in deep waters and rapid tideways and can attain lengths up to 40 metres (130 feet). The stalk is tough and whiplike, terminating in a single large bladder containing up to 10 percent carbon monoxide. The long leafy outgrowths from the stalk carry out photosynthesis and reproduction.
