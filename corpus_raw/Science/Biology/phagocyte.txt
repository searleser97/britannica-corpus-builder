Phagocyte,  type of cell that has the ability to ingest, and sometimes digest, foreign particles, such as bacteria, carbon, dust, or dye. It engulfs foreign bodies by extending its cytoplasm into pseudopods (cytoplasmic extensions like feet), surrounding the foreign particle and forming a vacuole. Poisons contained in the ingested bacteria cannot harm the phagocyte so long as the bacteria remain in the vacuole; phagocyte enzymes are secreted into the vacuole in which digestion takes place. In the blood, two types of white blood cells, neutrophilic leukocytes (microphages) and monocytes (macrophages), are phagocytic. Neutrophils are small, granular leukocytes that quickly appear at the site of a wound and ingest bacteria. Monocytes are larger, with a large, kidney-shaped nucleus; they appear about three days after infection and scavenge for bacteria, foreign particles, dead cellular material, and protozoa. Most phagocytic activity takes place outside the vascular system, among the cells. For example, foreign material in the lymph system is phagocytosed by fixed cells in the lymph nodes; similarly, the vascular system is cleansed by fixed cells in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow that engulf aged red blood cells and foreign bodies. Special cells in the lungs ingest dust particles. Fixed macrophages in loose connective tissue, as in spleen or bone marrow, are capable of rounding up and becoming free macrophages under the proper stimulus (e.g., inflammation).
