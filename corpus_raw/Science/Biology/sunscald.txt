Sunscald,   common disorder of exposed, thin-barked trees, shrubs, and other plants. Dead patches form on the sun-exposed trunk and limbs of young trees, often those recently transplanted to open areas from nurseries where they were shaded by nearby trees. Evergreens and shrubs show scorched foliage and shoot dieback in dry, sunny, and windy spots, especially in very early spring. Control includes wrapping young tree trunks, applying whitewash, white latex paint, or an antidesiccant (to retard loss of plant moisture), and growing susceptible plants in more protected locations. Evergreens, especially in winter and very early spring, should be protected from too much sun and from cold, drying winds. Much sunscald injury can be avoided by watering plants thoroughly in dry autumns before the soil freezes and applying a mulch to keep the soil frozen until spring, when full-scale plant activity resumes and roots can provide the moisture the top growth requires.
