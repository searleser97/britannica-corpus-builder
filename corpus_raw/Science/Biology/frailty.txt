Frailty, also called frailty syndrome,  medical condition that occurs as a result of aging-associated declines in energy, strength, and function that increase a personâ€™s vulnerability to stress and disease. Frailty typically is seen in persons age 65 and older, its prevalence increasing with age.
Although it has been unclear whether frailty can be diagnosed, different diagnostic approaches have been developed. A commonly used approach is based on a set of five criteria, which include unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, weakness, and slow walking speed. When three or more of those criteria are present in a person over age 65, he or she may be diagnosed with frailty. Frailty also may be assessed using a frailty index, which takes into account the presence of factors such as disease, disability, and mental health as well as falls, urinary incontinence, and other conditions associated with aging.
The care of frail individuals is often complex because of their older age and their need for ongoing care. Many patients are also affected by other diseases or disorders, the existence and treatment of which may worsen frailty. However, various interventions that address specific components of frailty can benefit some patients. Carefully designed dietary and exercise interventions, for example, may improve energy levels and strength, while cognitive and social activities can help improve independence.
