Nail-patella syndrome,  rare hereditary (autosomal dominant) disorder characterized by small fingernails and toenails that show a tendency to split; small or absent kneecaps (patellae);  underdevelopment of parts of the knee, elbow joint, and shoulder blade; spurs of bone on the inside of the pelvis; and kidney insufficiency. Nail-patella syndrome is apparent at birth or appears during early childhood. The mutated gene in persons with the disorder has been identified. Affected persons often experience dislocations, limited joint mobility, and early onset of osteoarthritis. Eye abnormalities, particularly glaucoma, may also occur. Treatment includes prevention or management of renal disorders; orthopedic care also may be necessary.
