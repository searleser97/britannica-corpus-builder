Protozoal disease,  disease caused by protozoans. These organisms may remain in the human host for their entire life cycle, but many carry out part of their reproductive cycle in insects or other hosts. For example, mosquitoes are vectors of plasmodium, the cause of malaria. See also entamoeba; Giardia lamblia; sleeping sickness.
