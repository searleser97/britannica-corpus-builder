Acrasieae,  class name for cellular slime molds (division Myxomycophyta). The class contains a single order, Acrasiales, and about a dozen species. The vegetative phase of these slime molds consists of amoeba-like cells (myxamoebas) that group together ultimately to form a fruiting (reproductive) structure.
