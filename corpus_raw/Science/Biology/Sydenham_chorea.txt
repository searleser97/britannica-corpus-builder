Sydenham chorea, also called St. Vitus Dance, chorea minor, infectious chorea, or rheumatic chorea,  a neurological disorder characterized by irregular and involuntary movements of muscle groups in various parts of the body that follow streptococcal infection. The name St. Vitus Dance derives from the late Middle Ages, when persons with the disease attended the chapels of St. Vitus, who was believed to have curative powers. The disorder was first explained by the English physician Thomas Sydenham. Most often a manifestation of rheumatic fever, Sydenham chorea occurs most frequently between the ages of 5 and 15 years, and is more common in girls than boys. The disease may occur as an infrequent complication of pregnancy.
The symptoms of Sydenham chorea range in severity from mild to completely incapacitating. A vague deterioration in the ability to perform everyday tasks is replaced by involuntary jerking movements that are most obvious in the extremities and face but are also present in the trunk. Twitching movements are more noticeable on the limbs of one side of the body. The muscles of speech and swallowing may also be affected. Irritability, anxiety, and emotional instability, chiefly episodes of crying initiated by trivial incidents, are also common symptoms.
It is thought that Sydenham chorea is caused by a malfunctioning of the basal ganglia, groups of nerve cells in the brain. There is evidence that both the emotional manifestations and the abnormal movements of the disease are related to changes in the cerebral cortex. Attacks of Sydenham chorea tend to be self-limited, although the duration of each is several weeks; recurrence is frequent. Recovery is usually complete and is accelerated by bedrest. Sedation or the administration of tranquilizers may provide protection from self-injury in severe cases, when the patient is helpless.
