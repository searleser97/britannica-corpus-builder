Aecium, also called aecidium,  a cluster-cup or fruiting body of certain rust fungi (phylum Basidiomycota, kingdom Fungi). Yellow to orange in colour, aecia develop after fertilization and bear one-celled spores (aeciospores, or aecidiospores). Aecia are usually found on lower leaf surfaces of plants.
