Sooty mold, also called blotch or black mold,  plant disease characterized by splotchy black stains or coatings on leaves, stems, and fruit. The black residue of sooty mold is composed of dark fungal threads of a number of ascomycetes, including species of Alternaria, Capnodium, Cladosporium, Fumago, and Scorias. These fungi grow in flowing sap or on honeydew excreted by aphids and other sucking insects. Although the condition is unsightly, it usually is not harmful. Control includes spraying or dusting for sucking insects, washing off sticky coatings of sap or honeydew on plant surfaces, and avoiding the wounding of plants.
