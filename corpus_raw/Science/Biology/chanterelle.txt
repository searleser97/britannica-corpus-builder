Chanterelle,  Highly prized, fragrant, edible mushroom (Cantharellus cibarius) in the order Cantharellales (phylum Basidiomycota). It is bright yellow in colour and is found growing on forest floors in summer and autumn. Its similarity to the poisonous jack-o-lantern (Clitocybe illudens, order Agaricales), an orange-yellow fungus that glows in the dark, emphasizes the need for careful identification by the mushroom gatherer.
