Bird of prey,  any bird that pursues other animals for food. Birds of prey are classified in two orders: Falconiformes and Strigiformes. All birds of prey have hook-tipped beaks and sharp curved claws called talons (in nonpredatory vultures the talons are present but atrophied). In spite of the similarities between the two groups, many authorities believe that they are not closely related but rather that they developed similar methods of living a predatory life.
Diurnal birds of prey—hawks, eagles, vultures, and falcons (Falconiformes)—are also called raptors, which comprise more than 500 species. The word raptor is derived from the Latin raptare, “to seize and carry off.” (The name raptor is sometimes synonymous with the designation bird of prey.) The condors (species of vultures) and the eagles are the largest and strongest members of this group, and they are among the largest and strongest of all living birds. The nocturnal birds of prey are the owls (Strigiformes), a group made up of more than 200 species.
