Jerry Ross, in full Jerry Lynn Ross,  (born January 20, 1948, Crown Point, Indiana, U.S.), American astronaut, the first person to be launched into space seven times.
Ross earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering in 1970 at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. After receiving a master’s degree in mechanical engineering in 1972, he started active duty with the U.S. Air Force (USAF). He graduated from the flight test engineer course at the USAF Test Pilot School in 1976. During his career Ross flew more than 20 different types of aircraft, mainly military aircraft, and clocked more than 4,000 flying hours.
In February 1979 he was assigned to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston. In May 1980, while working there as a payload officer and a flight controller, he was selected to be an astronaut. During his career he logged more than 58 days in space, including more than 58 hours over nine space walks. His space missions included flying as the mission specialist on seven flights: STS-61-B (1985, deployment of three communications satellites), STS-27 (1988, deployment of a military reconnaissance satellite), STS-37 (1991, launch of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory), STS-55 (1993, payload of the German Spacelab D-2), STS-74 (1995, the second docking of a space shuttle with the Russian space station Mir), STS-88 (1998, the first assembly mission for the International Space Station [ISS]), and STS-110 (2002, another ISS assembly mission).
Ross held many positions with NASA, including branch chief of the Astronaut Office at the Kennedy Space Center and chief astronaut for the Engineering and Safety Center. He retired from the air force as a colonel in 2000. In 2007 Ross became chief of the Vehicle Integration Test Office at the JSC. He retired from NASA in 2012. The following year he published the memoir Spacewalker: My Journey in Space and Faith as NASA’s Record-Setting Frequent Flyer (written with John Norberg).
