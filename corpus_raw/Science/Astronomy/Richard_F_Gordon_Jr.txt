Richard F. Gordon, Jr., in full Richard Francis Gordon, Jr.,  (born October 5, 1929, Seattle, Washington, U.S.â€”died November 6, 2017, San Marcos, California), American astronaut who accompanied Charles Conrad on the September 1966 flight of Gemini 11. They docked with an Agena target on the first orbit and were propelled together to a record altitude of 850 miles (about 1,370 km). During a 45-minute space walk, Gordon joined the two crafts with a tether.
Gordon entered naval aviation training after he graduated from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1951. Six years later he became a test pilot, and in 1961 he won the Bendix Trophy Race, piloting an F4H Phantom jet from Los Angeles to New York City in the record time of 2 hours 47 minutes (an average speed of 879 miles [1,414 km] per hour).
In 1963 Gordon was chosen to be an astronaut. With Alan L. Bean and Charles Conrad, Gordon made the Apollo 12 flight, launched on November 14, 1969. During this mission, the second manned landing on the Moon, Gordon was pilot of the Command Module and remained in lunar orbit during the lunar exploration. Gordon retired from the navy and the space program in 1972 and until 1977 served as executive vice president of the New Orleans Saints, a professional gridiron-football team.
