German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel obtained a value of 10.3 light-years in 1838; the European Space Agency satellite Hipparcos made much more accurate distance measurements than ground-based telescopes had accomplished and obtained a distance to 61 Cygni of 11.4 light-years. The star is a visual binary, the components of which revolve around each other in a period of 659 years, and is located in the northern constellation Cygnus. They are of fifth and sixth magnitudes.
