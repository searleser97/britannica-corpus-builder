Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1),  also called Naro,  series of South Korean launch vehicles that were designed to launch Earth-orbiting satellites and that brought South Korea into the club of space nations. The KSLV-1 is 33 metres (108 feet) tall and 3.9 metres (12.8 feet) in diameter. It has two stages: a liquid-fueled first stage developed in Russia by the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center and a solid-fueled second stage developed by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute. The KSLV-1 is designed to lift up to 100 kg (220 pounds) to low Earth orbit.
The first launch of the KSLV-1 was intended to place South Korea’s first satellite, Science and Technology Satellite-2A (STSAT-2A), into orbit. The launch took place on August 25, 2009, at the Naro Space Center in South Chŏlla (South Jeolla) province. After a successful first-stage ascent, one of the two payload fairings that covered the satellite failed to separate, and the second stage did not have enough fuel to overcome the additional weight. A second launch attempt, carrying STSAT-2B, took place on June 10, 2010. On that occasion the vehicle exploded, slightly more than two minutes into its first-stage ascent. The third attempt, carrying STSAT-2C, on January 30, 2013, was successful, and the satellite was placed in a roughly 300-by-1,500-km (200-by-900-mile) orbit.
