Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli,  (born March 14, 1835, Savigliano, Italy—died  July 4, 1910, Milan), Italian astronomer and senator whose reports of groups of straight lines on Mars touched off much controversy on the possible existence of life on that planet.
Schiaparelli went to Berlin in 1854 to study astronomy under Johann F. Encke. Two years later he was appointed assistant observer at the Pulkovo Observatory, Russia, a post he resigned in 1860 for a similar one at the Brera Observatory, Milan, where he remained until his retirement in 1900; he became director in 1862.
In 1861 Schiaparelli discovered the asteroid Hesperia. Five years later he demonstrated that meteor swarms have orbits similar to certain comets and concluded that the swarms are the remnants of comets. In particular, he calculated that the Perseid meteors are remnants of Comet 1862 III and the Leonids of Comet 1866 I. He also observed double stars and made extensive studies of Mercury, Venus, and Mars.
Schiaparelli called the peculiar markings he observed on Mars in 1877 canali. The word, erroneously translated into English as “canals” instead of “channels,” led to widespread speculation over whether the “canals” were constructed by intelligent beings. From his observations of Mercury and Venus, Schiaparelli concluded that those planets rotate on their axes at the same rate at which they revolve about the Sun, thus always keeping one side facing the Sun. This view was generally accepted until the late 1960s, when advanced radar techniques and space probes gave different values. On his retirement Schiaparelli studied the astronomy of the ancient Hebrews and Babylonians and wrote L’astronomia nell’antico testamento (1903; Astronomy in the Old Testament, 1905).
