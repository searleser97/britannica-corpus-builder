Lyra, (Latin: “Lyre”)  constellation in the northern sky at about 18 hours right ascension and 40° north in declination. Its brightest star is Vega, the fifth brightest star in the sky, with a magnitude of 0.03. With the bright stars Deneb and Altair, Vega is part of the prominent asterism of the Summer Triangle. The star Beta Lyrae was one of the first known variable stars; English astronomer John Goodricke discovered its period of 13 days in 1784. Another prominent variable star is RR Lyrae, which gave its name to a class of variable stars that are used in measuring distances to other galaxies. Lyra also contains the Ring Nebula, a planetary nebula that appears as a sphere of glowing gas. In Greek mythology this constellation represented the lyre played by the Greek hero Orpheus. In Chinese mythology Vega is identified with Niu Lang, a cowherd who fell in love with a princess, Zhi Nü (identified with Altair). Zhi Nü’s father punished them by placing them on opposite sides of the Milky Way.
