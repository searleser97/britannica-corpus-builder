Ring Nebula,   (catalog numbers NGC 6720 and M57), bright nebula in the constellation Lyra, about 2,300 light-years from the Earth. It was discovered in 1779 by the French astronomer Augustin Darquier. Like other nebulae of its type, called planetary nebulae, it is a sphere of glowing gas thrown off by a central star. Seen from a great distance, such a sphere appears brighter at the edge than at the centre and thus takes on the appearance of a luminous ring. It is a popular object for amateur astronomers.
