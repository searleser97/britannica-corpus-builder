Tiangong, (Chinese: “Heavenly Palace”)  any of a series of three Chinese space stations, the first of which was launched on September 29, 2011.
The first two Tiangongs were each an 8,500-kg (18,700-pound) cylinder that was 3.4 metres (11.2 feet) in diameter. They had two sections: a forward pressurized module that contained the astronauts’ living space and an unpressurized rear instrument module that contained Tiangong’s propulsion system. A pair of solar arrays attached to the instrument module provided power to the station. The launch vehicle was a Chang Zheng 2F/G (CZ-2F/G, or Long March 2F/G), a modified version of the CZ-2F, which was specifically developed for the Shenzhou program.
The uncrewed spacecraft Shenzhou 8 automatically docked with Tiangong 1 in November 2011. The first crewed mission, Shenzhou 9, arrived at Tiangong 1 in June 2012. Shenzhou 8 and 9 were, respectively, China’s first uncrewed and crewed space docking. Shenzhou 10, the last crewed flight to visit Tiangong 1, arrived in June 2013. Chinese engineers monitored Tiangong 1 until March 2016, when they ended communications with the station. Tiangong 1 reentered Earth’s atmosphere in April 2018.
Tiangong 2 launched on September 15, 2016. Only one spaceflight, Shenzhou 11, visited Tiangong 2. Two astronauts stayed aboard the station for 33 days beginning in October 2016. An uncrewed cargo spacecraft, Tianzhou 1, performed docking and refueling maneuvers with the station in 2017. Tiangong 2 reentered Earth’s atmosphere in July 2019.
A subsequent, larger Tiangong space station will have three modules: the core module, Tianhe, was launched in 2021, and two science modules, Wentian and Mengtian, will follow. The first crewed mission, Shenzhou 12, carried three astronauts and docked with Tianhe in June 2021. The new space station is planned to share its orbit with the Xuntian space telescope to allow astronauts to easily repair and upgrade the telescope. Like Tiangong 2, the station will be serviced by Tianzhou spacecraft.
