United States Naval Observatory (USNO),  in Washington, D.C., an official source, with the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; formerly the National Bureau of Standards), for standard time in the United States. The positional measurement of celestial objects for purposes of timekeeping and navigation has been the main work of the observatory since its beginning. In 1833 the first small observatory building was constructed near the Capitol. Time signals for the public were first given (1844) by the dropping of a ball from a staff on an observatory building. In 1904 the observatory broadcast the world’s first radio time signals.
The observatory has been enlarged and moved several times. A 102-cm (40-inch) reflecting telescope acquired in 1934 was moved in 1955 to Flagstaff, Ariz., to obtain better atmospheric conditions, and a 155-cm (61-inch) reflector has been in use at Flagstaff since 1964. An optical interferometer of three 50-cm (20-inch) telescopes was built at the Flagstaff station in 1996; three more telescopes were added to the interferometer in 2002. Other stations are maintained in Florida and in Argentina.
Statutory responsibility for “standard time” (i.e., establishment of time zones in the United States) is currently lodged with the Department of Transportation. The Naval Observatory is specifically responsible for standard time, time interval, and radio-frequency standards for use by the U.S. Department of Defense and its contractors. Both the USNO and the NIST maintain independent time standards, but since October 1968 they have been coordinated to maintain synchronization to approximately one microsecond. USNO broadcasts time and frequency information at intervals (as the NIST does on a 24-hour basis). Both agencies cooperate with the Bureau International de l’Heure in Paris.
