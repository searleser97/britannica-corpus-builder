Galilean telescope,   instrument for viewing distant objects, named after the great Italian scientist Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), who first constructed one in 1609. With it, he discovered Jupiter’s four largest satellites, spots on the Sun, phases of Venus, and hills and valleys on the Moon. It consists of a convergent lens as objective (i.e., the lens that forms the image); and its eyepiece (or ocular), placed in front of the focus, is a divergent lens. An upright image is produced. This simple refracting telescope is still used in modern opera glasses, which are low-powered binoculars.
