Zone of avoidance,  region characterized by an apparent absence of galaxies near the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy and caused by the obscuring effect of interstellar dust. It was so called by the American astronomer Edwin P. Hubble.
The zone of avoidance is entirely a local Milky Way Galaxy effect. Surveys in the infrared and radio regions of the electromagnetic spectrum have shown that many external galaxies lie beyond it. The mass concentration known as the Great Attractor lies within it.
