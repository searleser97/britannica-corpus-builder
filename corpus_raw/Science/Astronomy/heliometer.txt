Heliometer,  astronomical instrument often used to measure the Sun’s diameter and, more generally, angular distances on the sky  The heliometer consists of a telescope in which the objective lens is cut along its diameter into two halves that can be moved independently. This produces two separate images of an object. In the case of two stars, the distance the lenses must be moved in order to superimpose the two images together can be used to derive their angular separation. In the case of the Sun, the distance at which the two images of the Sun touch can be used to derive its diameter.
The first heliometers were designed by British scientist Servington Savery in 1743 and French scientist Pierre Bouguer in 1748. Their heliometers consisted of two separate lenses, which meant that angular separations of less than a certain minimum distance could not be measured. British optician John Dollond in 1753 cut the objective lens into two halves, which meant that much smaller angular distances could be measured. The heliometer’s most notable discovery happened in 1838 when German astronomer Friedrich Bessel used a heliometer designed by German physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer to perform the first measurement of the parallax, and hence the distance, of a star (61 Cygni) from Earth.
