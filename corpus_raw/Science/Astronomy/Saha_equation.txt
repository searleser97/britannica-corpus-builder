Saha equation,  mathematical relationship between the observed spectra of stars and their temperatures. The equation was stated first in 1920 by the Indian astrophysicist Meghnad N. Saha. It expresses how the state of ionization of any particular element in a star changes with varying temperatures and pressures. The spectrum of a star is directly related to the relative numbers of atoms and ions it contains because each atom or ion can absorb or emit radiation of a particular set of wavelengths.
The Saha equation is
Ni + 1/Ni  = 2/Ne  Ui + 1/Ui  (2πmekT/h2)3/2 e−(Ei + 1 − Ei)/kT
where Ni + 1 and Ni  are the number of atoms in the (i + 1)th and ith ionization states, respectively; Ui + 1 and Ui  describe how energy is partitioned among the (i + 1)th and ith ionization states; Ei + 1 and Ei  are the energies of the ionization states; Ne is the number of electrons; and T is the temperature. The other quantities in the equation are physical constants: me is the mass of the electron, k is the Boltzmann constant, and h is Planck’s constant.
