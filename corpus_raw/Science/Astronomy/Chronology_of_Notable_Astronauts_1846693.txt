 The term astronaut is commonly applied to an individual who has flown in outer space. More specifically, astronauts are those persons who went to space aboard a U.S. spacecraft; individuals who first traveled aboard a spacecraft operated by the Soviet Union or Russia are known as cosmonauts, and those from China are known as taikonauts. In the decades since Yury Gagarin became the first man in space in 1961, many milestones in space travel have been achieved by a variety of men and women from around the world.
