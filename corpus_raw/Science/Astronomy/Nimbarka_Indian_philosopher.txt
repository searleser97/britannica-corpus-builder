Nimbarka, also called Nimbaditya or Niyamananda,  (flourished 13th century, South India), Telugu-speaking Brahman, yogi, philosopher, and prominent astronomer who founded the devotional sect called Nimbarkas, Nimandi, or Nimavats, who worshipped the deity Krishna and his consort, Radha.
Nimbarka has been identified with Bhaskara, a 9th- or 10th-century philosopher and celebrated commentator on the Brahma-sutras (Vedanta-sutras). Most historians of Hindu mysticism, however, hold that Nimbarka probably lived in the 12th or 13th century.
The Nimbarka sect flourished in the 13th and 14th centuries in eastern India. Its philosophy held that men were trapped in physical bodies constricted by prakrti (matter) and that only by surrender to Radha-Krishna (not through their own efforts) could they attain the grace necessary for liberation from rebirth; then, at death, the physical body would drop away. Thus Nimbarka stressed bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion and faith. Many books were written about this once-popular cult, but most sources were destroyed by Muslims during the reign of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (1659â€“1707), and thus little information has survived about Nimbarka and his followers.
