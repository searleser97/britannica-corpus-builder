Roy Kerr, in full Roy Patrick Kerr,  (born May 16, 1934, Kurow, New Zealand), New Zealand mathematician who solved (1963) Einstein’s field equations of general relativity to describe rotating black holes, thus providing a major contribution to the field of astrophysics.
Kerr received an M.S. (1954) from New Zealand University (now dissolved) and his Ph.D. (1960) from Cambridge University. He served on the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin (1963–72) and, returning to New Zealand, then became a professor of mathematics at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, in 1972; he retired as professor emeritus in 1993.
Kerr worked in the tradition of Karl Schwarzschild, who in 1916, shortly after the appearance of Einstein’s general relativity theory, formulated from Einstein’s field equations a mathematical description of a static, nonrotating black hole and the effect of its gravity on the space and time surrounding it. Scientists surmise, however, that black holes probably are not static. Since they are theoretically formed from the collapse of massive dead stars, and since virtually all stars rotate, black holes probably rotate also. Kerr’s mathematical formula provides the sole basis for describing the properties of black holes theorists expect to find in space. His solution is called the Kerr metric, or Kerr solution, and rotating black holes are also called Kerr black holes. In later work (written jointly with A. Schild), he introduced a new class of solutions, known as Kerr–Schild solutions, which have had a profound influence on finding exact solutions to Einstein’s equations.
Kerr’s awards include the Crafoord Prize (2016).
