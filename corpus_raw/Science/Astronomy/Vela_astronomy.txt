Vela, (Latin: “Sail”)  constellation in the southern sky at about 10 hours right ascension and 50° south in declination. Its brightest star is Gamma Velorum, with a magnitude of 1.6. The largest known emission nebula, the Gum Nebula, is found here and in the neighbouring constellation Puppis. The Vela pulsar is the brightest celestial source of gamma rays. This constellation was originally part of the much larger Argo Navis, which represented the ship Argo, in which Jason and the Argonauts sailed to retrieve the Golden Fleece. The French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, in his Coelum Australe Stelliferum (“Star Catalog of the Southern Sky,” 1763), broke up Argo Navis into the smaller constellations of Carina, Puppis, and Vela.
