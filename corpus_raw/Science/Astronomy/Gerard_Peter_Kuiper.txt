Gerard Peter Kuiper, original name Gerrit Pieter Kuiper,  (born Dec. 7, 1905, Harenkarspel, Neth.—died  Dec. 23, 1973, Mexico City, Mexico), Dutch-American astronomer known especially for his discoveries and theories concerning the solar system.
Kuiper graduated from the University of Leiden in 1927 and received his Ph.D. from that school in 1933. That same year he moved to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen (1937). He joined the staff of Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago in 1936, twice serving as director (1947–49 and 1957–60) of both Yerkes and McDonald observatories. Kuiper founded the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona in 1960 and served as its director until his death.
After conducting research in stellar astronomy, Kuiper shifted his focus to planetary research in the 1940s. In 1944 he was able to confirm the presence of a methane atmosphere around Saturn’s moon Titan. In 1947 he predicted (correctly) that carbon dioxide is a major component of the atmosphere of Mars, and he also correctly predicted that the rings of Saturn are composed of particles of ice. That same year he discovered the fifth moon of Uranus (Miranda), and in 1949 he discovered the second moon of Neptune (Nereid). In 1950 he obtained the first reliable measurement of the visual diameter of Pluto. In 1956 he proved that Mars’s polar icecaps are composed of frozen water, not of carbon dioxide as had been previously assumed. Kuiper’s 1964 prediction of what the surface of the Moon would be like to walk on (“it would be like crunchy snow”) was verified by the astronaut Neil Armstrong in 1969.
In 1949 Kuiper proposed an influential theory of the origin of the solar system, suggesting that the planets had formed by the condensation of a large cloud of gas around the Sun. He also suggested the possible existence of a disk-shaped belt of comets orbiting the Sun at a distance of 30 to 50 astronomical units. The existence of this belt of millions of comets was verified in the 1990s, and it was named the Kuiper belt. Kuiper also initiated the use of high-flying jet aircraft to carry telescopes for infrared observations above the obscuring layers of the atmosphere. The Kuiper Airborne Observatory (1974) was named in his honour, as were craters on the Moon, Mercury, and Mars.
