Colour index,  in astronomy, the difference between two measurements of the magnitude (brightness on a logarithmic scale) of a star made at different wavelengths, the value found at the longer wavelength being subtracted from that found at the shorter. Usually the two wavelengths are the blue (B) and the visual (V) as defined in the UBV system.The index is a measure of a starâ€™s colour, an indication of its temperature, and a fairly crude description of the distribution of its radiated energy through the electromagnetic spectrum. The zero point of the colour index scale in the UBV system is chosen such that stars that have a surface temperature of 7,400 K and that are white in colour, such as Vega, have a colour index of zero. Hot, blue stars have negative colour indices, as they radiate most strongly and therefore have numerically lower magnitudes at short wavelengths, and those of cool, red stars are positive. The colour index of a star is increased by the passage of its light through interstellar matter; the amount by which it exceeds the normal value for its spectral type is called the colour excess. (See also  magnitude and UBV system.)
