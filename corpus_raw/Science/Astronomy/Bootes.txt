Boötes,  constellation in the northern sky, at about 15 hours right ascension and 30° north in declination. The brightest star in Boötes is Arcturus, the third brightest star in the sky. The radiant of the Quadrantid meteor shower, which happens in early January, is found in Boötes. The name Boötes is thought to stem from the Greek word for either “ox driver” or “noisy” (referring to the shouts of an ox driver or herdsman spurring on his animals). Greek mythology identified this constellation as either Icarius, the hero of the Attic deme of Icaria, or Arcas, a human son of Zeus.
