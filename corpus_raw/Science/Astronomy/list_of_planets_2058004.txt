 A planet is any relatively large natural body that revolves in an orbit around the Sun or around some other star and that is not radiating energy from internal nuclear fusion reactions. In addition to the above description, some scientists impose additional constraints regarding characteristics such as size, shape, or mass. As the term is applied to bodies in Earthâ€™s solar system, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) lists eight planets orbiting the Sun. Pluto also was listed as a planet until 2006. This is a list of selected planets. (See also astronomy; infrared astronomy; planetarium; radio and radar astronomy; ultraviolet astronomy.)
