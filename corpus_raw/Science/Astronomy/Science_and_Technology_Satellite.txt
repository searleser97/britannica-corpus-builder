Science and Technology Satellite (STSAT),  any of a series of South Korean satellites, of which STSAT-2C was the first launched into orbit by South Korea. The first satellite in the series, STSAT-1, was launched by a Kosmos rocket from Plestek, Russia, on September 25, 2003.
The second satellite in the series, STSAT-2A, would have been the first satellite launched into orbit by South Korea. STSAT-2A was launched on August 25, 2009, by the Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 from the Naro Space Center, near Kohŭng (Goheung) in South Chŏlla (South Jeolla) province. One of the two payload fairings that covered the satellite failed to separate, however, and the second stage did not have enough fuel to overcome the additional weight. STSAT-2A burned up in Earth’s atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. It had a mass of about 100 kg (220 pounds). It also had two scientific experiments on board: a radiometer to study atmospheric water vapour and a laser ranging apparatus that could have determined a precise orbit for STSAT-2A and helped to calibrate the radiometer. STSAT-2B, which was identical to STSAT-2A, was launched on June 10, 2010, but the rocket exploded.
STSAT-2C, which launched successfully on January 30, 2013, was placed in a roughly 300-by-1,500-km (200-by-900-mile) orbit. It also carried a laser ranging apparatus, as well as two experiments designed to measure plasma and radiation near Earth. The satellite was expected to have a lifetime of less than one year.
