Eddington mass limit, also called Eddington limit,  theoretical upper limit to the mass of a star or an accretion disk. The limit is named for English astrophysicist Sir Arthur Eddington. At the Eddington mass limit, the outward pressure of the star’s radiation balances the inward gravitational force. If a star exceeds this limit, its luminosity would be so high that it would blow off the outer layers of the star. The limit depends upon the specific internal conditions of the star and is around several hundred solar masses. The star with the largest mass determined to date is R136a1, a giant of about 265 solar masses that had as much as 320 solar masses when it was formed. The Eddington mass limit explains why stars much larger than this have not been observed. In the case of an accretion disk, the outward pressure of the disk’s radiation balances the inward flow of accretion.
Sometimes astronomical objects have luminosities that exceed those set by the Eddington mass limit. In these cases, such behaviour is called super-Eddington and has been attributed to such processes as convection, so that the internal fluid motions transport some energy and thus the portion of the object’s luminosity that can be attributed to radiation is smaller than that of the Eddington mass limit.
