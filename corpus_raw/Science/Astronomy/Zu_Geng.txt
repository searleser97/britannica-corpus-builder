Zu Geng, Wade-Giles Tsu Keng, also known as Zu Xuan,  (born c. 480, Jiankang [modern Nanjing, Jiangsu province], China—died c. 525, China), Chinese government official, mathematician, astronomer, and son of Zu Chongzhi (429–500).
Beginning in 504, Zu Geng actively advocated his father’s calendar (the Daming calendar) and finally succeeded in getting it officially adopted in 510. His astronomical observations with gnomons allowed him to measure the angular distance between Polaris and the celestial north pole. Although none of his complete mathematical writings is extant, some scholars suggest that the mathematical treatise Zhuishu (meaning of the title now uncertain), conventionally credited to his father and lost by the 11th century, was actually written or cowritten by him. A mathematical fragment of his was appended by Li Chunfeng (602–670) to the commentary of Liu Hui (c. 263) on Jiuzhang suanshu (Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Procedures), a Chinese classic probably compiled in the 1st century ce (see mathematics, East Asian: Mathematics in China). Fragments of Zu Geng’s writings are also found in the astronomical chapter of Suishu (“History of the Sui Dynasty”).
Zu Geng’s fame as a mathematician rests primarily on his derivation and proof of the formula for the volume of a sphere. Liu Hui had demonstrated that a previously accepted formula was incorrect by constructing a special curvilinear solid for comparison, but he was unable to derive the correct formula. Both authors used a principle seemingly resembling that of the Italian mathematician Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598–1647).
