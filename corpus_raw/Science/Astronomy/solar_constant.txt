Solar constant,  the total radiation energy received from the Sun per unit of time per unit of area on a theoretical surface perpendicular to the Sun’s rays and at Earth’s mean distance from the Sun. It is most accurately measured from satellites where atmospheric effects are absent. The value of the constant is approximately 1.366 kilowatts per square metre. The “constant” is fairly constant, increasing by only 0.2 percent at the peak of each 11-year solar cycle. Sunspots block out the light and reduce the emission by a few tenths of a percent, but bright spots, called plages, that are associated with solar activity are more extensive and longer lived, so their brightness compensates for the darkness of the sunspots. Moreover, as the Sun burns up its hydrogen, the solar constant increases by about 10 percent every billion years.
