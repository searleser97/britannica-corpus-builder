Altitude and azimuth,  in astronomy, gunnery, navigation, and other fields, two coordinates describing the position of an object above Earth. Altitude in this sense is expressed as angular elevation (up to 90°) above the horizon. Azimuth is the number of degrees clockwise from due north (usually) to the object’s vertical circle (i.e., a great circle through the object and the zenith).
