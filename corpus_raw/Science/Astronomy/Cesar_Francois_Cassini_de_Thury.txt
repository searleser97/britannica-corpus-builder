César-François Cassini de Thury, also called Cassini Iii,  (born June 17, 1714, Thury, France—died  Sept. 4, 1784, Paris), French astronomer and geodesist, who continued surveying work undertaken by his father, Jacques Cassini, and began construction of a great topographical map of France.
Although he, his father, and his grandfather had defended the Cartesian view that the Earth is somewhat elongated (with a polar diameter greater than the equatorial diameter), Cassini III abandoned that position in the face of growing evidence that favoured the opposite, so-called Newtonian view that the Earth is flattened at the poles. He succeeded his father as director of the Paris Observatory in 1771, but his achievements as an astronomer were less distinguished then those as a geodesist and cartographer. From the 1740s until his death, Cassini de Thury directed work on a general topographic map of France. Published in 1789, this Carte géométrique de la France (“Geometric Map of France”), or Carte de Cassini, was the first map of an entire country drawn up on the basis of extensive triangulation and topographic surveys. Another of his works is Description géométrique de la Terre (1775; “Geometric Description of the Earth”).
