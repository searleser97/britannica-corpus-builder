Fraunhofer lines,   in astronomical spectroscopy, any of the dark (absorption) lines in the spectrum of the Sun or other star, caused by selective absorption of the Sun’s or star’s radiation at specific wavelengths by the various elements existing as gases in its atmosphere. The lines were first observed in 1802 by the English physicist William Hyde Wollaston but are named for the German physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer, who from about 1814 plotted more than 500 of them and designated the brightest by the letters A through G, a system of identification still in use. About 25,000 Fraunhofer lines are now known to exist in the solar spectrum, between the wavelengths of 2,950 and 10,000 angstroms. (One angstrom equals 10-8 cm.)
