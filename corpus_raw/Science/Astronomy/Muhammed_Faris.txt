Muhammed Faris, in full Muhammed Ahmed Faris,  (born May 26, 1951, Aleppo, Syria), Syrian pilot and air force officer who became the first Syrian citizen to go into space.
After graduating from military pilot school at the Syrian air force academy near Aleppo in 1973, Faris joined the air force and eventually attained the rank of colonel. He also served as an aviation instructor and a specialist in navigation later in his military career. In 1985 he was chosen as one of two Syrian candidates to participate in the Intercosmos spaceflight program, which allowed cosmonauts from allied countries to participate in Soviet space missions. Faris reported to the cosmonaut training centre in Star City, Russia, for training on Sept. 30, 1985.
Faris flew into space as a research cosmonaut on board the Soyuz TM-3 spacecraft on July 22, 1987, as part of the first visiting crew to the Mir orbital space station. The three-man crew included, along with Faris, two Soviet cosmonauts, Aleksandr Viktorenko and Aleksandr P. Aleksandrov. During the mission, Faris conducted several research experiments with Soviet cosmonauts in the fields of space medicine and materials processing. He returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-2 on July 30, 1987, having spent a total of eight days in space.
After his mission, Faris returned to the Syrian air force and settled in Aleppo. For his accomplishments as a cosmonaut, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, and he also received the Order of Lenin, the Soviet Unionâ€™s highest civilian decoration.
