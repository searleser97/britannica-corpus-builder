Gravitational lens,  matter that through the bending of space in its gravitational field alters the direction of light passing nearby. The effect is analogous to that produced by a lens.
One of the most remarkable predictions of Einstein’s theory of general relativity is that gravity bends light. That effect was first demonstrated during a total solar eclipse in 1919, when the positions of stars near the Sun were observed to be slightly shifted from their usual positions—an effect due to the pull of the Sun’s gravity as the stars’ light passed close to the Sun. In the 1930s Einstein predicted that a mass distribution, such as a galaxy, could act as a gravitational “lens,” not only bending light but also distorting images of objects lying beyond the gravitating mass. If some object is behind a massive galaxy, as seen from Earth, deflected light may reach Earth by more than one path. Operating like a lens that focuses light along different paths, the gravity of the galaxy may make the object appear stretched or as though the light is coming from multiple objects, rather than a single object. The object’s light may even be spread into a ring. The first gravitational lens was discovered in 1979, when two quasars were discovered very close to each other in the sky and with similar distances and spectra. The two quasars were actually the same object whose light had been split into two paths by the gravitational influence of an intervening galaxy.
Rings or distinct multiple images of an object appear when the lens is extremely massive, and such lensing is called strong lensing. However, often the intervening lens is only strong enough to slightly stretch the background object; this is known as weak lensing. By studying the statistical properties of the shapes of very distant galaxies and quasars, astronomers can use the effects of weak lensing to study the distribution of dark matter in the universe.
