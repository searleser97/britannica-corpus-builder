Lagoon Nebula,  (catalog numbers NGC 6523 and M8), ionized-hydrogen region located in the constellation Sagittarius at 1,250 parsecs (4,080 light-years) from the solar system. The nebula is a cloud of interstellar gas and dust approximately 10 parsecs (33 light-years) in diameter. A group of young, hot stars in the cloud ionize the nearby gas. As the atoms in the gas recombine, they produce the light emitted by the nebula. Interstellar dust within the nebula absorbs some of this light and appears almost to divide the nebula, thus producing a lagoonlike shape.
