It is located an estimated 2,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Auriga. The primary star is a yellow-white star about 135 times the size of the Sun. The secondary star, once thought to be thousands of times the size of the Sun, is a hot main-sequence star surrounded by an immense disk of gas that eclipses the primary for two years.
