Nova Persei, also called GK Persei,  bright nova that attained an absolute magnitude of âˆ’9.2. Spectroscopic observations of the nova, which appeared in 1901, provided important information about interstellar gas. The shell thrown off by the exploding star was unusually asymmetrical, and a bright nebulosity near the star appeared to be expanding incredibly fast, at practically the speed of light. This apparent speed is thought to have been an effect of reflection within a preexisting dark nebula around the star. From this phenomenon, sometimes called a light echo, it is possible to calculate the distance of the nova from Earth, about 1,500 light-years.
