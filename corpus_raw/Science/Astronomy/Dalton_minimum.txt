Dalton minimum, also called Modern minimum,  period of reduced sunspot activity that occurred between roughly 1790 and 1830. It was named for the English meteorologist and chemist John Dalton.
Sunspot activity waxes and wanes with over about an 11-year cycle. During the Dalton minimum, the solar cycle continued; however, the number of sunspots at the peak of the solar cycles was about one-third of that observed during normal solar cycles. The three solar cycles that occurred during the Dalton minimum also had unusually long periods of sunspot inactivity.
As with the Maunder minimum (1645–1715), a period of almost no sunspots that coincided with the coldest part of the Little Ice Age, the Dalton minimum coincided with a period of cooler temperatures around the world. (Some of the decrease in temperatures can be attributed to the massive eruption of Mount Tambora on the island of Sumbawa in present-day Indonesia in April 1815. Parts of the Northern Hemisphere experienced sporadic periods of heavy snow and killing frost through June, July, and August 1816, which came to be known there as the “year without a summer.”) However, the physical mechanism that explains how changes in activity on the Sun affect Earth’s climate is unknown, and such episodes, however suggestive, do not prove that lower sunspot numbers produce cooling.
