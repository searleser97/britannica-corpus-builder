Jonathan Homer Lane,  (born Aug. 9, 1819, Geneseo, N.Y., U.S.—died  May 3, 1880, Washington, D.C.), U.S. astrophysicist who was the first to investigate mathematically the Sun as a gaseous body. His work demonstrated the interrelationships of pressure, temperature, and density inside the Sun and was fundamental to the emergence of modern theories of stellar evolution.
Lane became an assistant examiner in the U.S. Patent Office in 1848 and three years later became principal examiner. From 1857 he worked as an expert counsellor in patent cases. His solar studies culminated in Lane’s law, which states that as a gaseous body contracts (under the influence of gravity, for example), the contraction generates heat. He used this law to explain how the Sun built up its intense heat over the eons. His most important publication is On the Theoretical Temperature of the Sun (1870).
Lane also studied electricity and worked on a machine for calculating mathematical roots. In addition, he devised an electromechanical governor, a “visual telegraph,” and an air pump; he also experimented with mechanical refrigeration.
