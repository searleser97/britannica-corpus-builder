James Melville Gilliss,  (born Sept. 6, 1811, Georgetown, Md., U.S.—died  Feb. 9, 1865, Washington, D.C.), U.S. naval officer and astronomer who founded the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., the first U.S. observatory devoted entirely to research.
Gilliss entered the U.S. Navy in 1827 and 10 years later was put in charge of the navy’s Depot of Charts and Instruments, in Washington, D.C. His responsibilities included making astronomical observations necessary for longitude determinations of newly explored land. At his recommendation, funds were provided by Congress in 1842 for founding the Naval Observatory, and he supervised its construction (1843–44).
Gilliss undertook an astronomical expedition, constructing a station (later a permanent observatory) in Santiago, Chile, to observe Mars and Venus (1847–52). During this expedition he also charted more than 23,000 stars and made many other observations. He later led expeditions to Peru (1858) and Washington Territory (1860). From 1861 he served as director of the Naval Observatory.
