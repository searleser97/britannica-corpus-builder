Cohenite,  an iron nickel carbide mineral with some cobalt [(Fe,Ni,Co)3C] that occurs as an accessory constituent of iron meteorites, including all coarse octahedrites containing 7 percent nickel or less, and that is a rare constituent of some chondritic stony meteorites and micrometeorites. Another iron nickel carbide, haxonite [(Fe,Ni)23C6], also occurs in these meteorites. Cohenite closely resembles another meteoritic mineral, schreibersite, and it may be more common in meteorites than is supposed. When manufactured on Earth, as in steel, it is called cementite. For detailed physical properties, see native element (table).
