Crux, (Latin: Cross) , also called the Southern Cross,  constellation lying in the southern sky at about 12 hours 30 minutes right ascension and 60° south declination and visible only from south of about latitude 30° N (i.e., the latitude of North Africa and Florida). It appears on the flags of Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa.
French architect and cartographer Augustine Royer first described it as a constellation in a set of star maps published in 1679, but it has been written about since antiquity. The constellation has five bright stars, one badly placed from the viewpoint of symmetry, so the shape of the cross formed by the stars is somewhat irregular. Two of Crux’s stars, Alpha Crucis and Beta Crucis, are the 13th and 20th brightest stars in the sky, respectively, with magnitudes of 0.8 and 1.3. The constellation also contains the conspicuous molecular cloud called the Coalsack.
