astrolabe,  any of a type of early scientific instrument used for reckoning time and for observational purposes. One widely employed variety, the planispheric astrolabe, enabled astronomers to calculate the position of the Sun and prominent stars with respect to both the horizon and the meridian. It provided them with a plane image of the celestial sphere and the principal circles—namely, those representing the ecliptic, celestial equator, and tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Because of such features, the planispheric astrolabe can be regarded as a kind of rudimentary analog computer.
Astrolabes have been traced to the 6th century, and they appear to have come into wide use from the early Middle Ages in Europe and the Islamic world. By about the mid-15th century, astrolabes were adopted by mariners and used in celestial navigation. The so-called mariner’s astrolabe was later supplanted by sextants.
The typical planispheric astrolabe employed by medieval astronomers measured from 8 to 46 cm (3 to 18 inches) and was made of metal—usually brass or iron. It had several principal parts: a base plate (the mater) with a network of lines representing celestial coordinates; an open-pattern disk (the rete) with a “map” of the stars, including the aforementioned circles, that rotated on the mater around a centre pin corresponding to the north celestial pole; and a straight rule (the alidade), used for sighting objects in the sky. The alidade made it possible to use the astrolabe for surveying applications—e.g., determining the height of a mountain. Most astrolabes also had one or more plates (called climates) that were engraved with coordinate lines for different latitudes and were placed between the mater and the rete.
