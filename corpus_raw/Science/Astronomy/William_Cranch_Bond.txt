William Cranch Bond,  (born Sept. 9, 1789, Falmouth, District of Maine, Mass. [now Portland, Maine], U.S.—died  Jan. 29, 1859, Cambridge, Mass.), American astronomer who, with his son George Phillips Bond (1825–65), discovered Hyperion, the eighth satellite of Saturn, and an inner ring called Ring C, or the Crepe Ring. They also took some of the first recognizable photographs of celestial objects.
Largely self-educated, Bond was a watchmaker who became interested in astronomy after observing the solar eclipse of 1806. He built a home observatory that was one of the finest in the United States at that time. Bond independently discovered many comets, and in recognition of his efforts, he was appointed the first astronomical observer at Harvard College in 1839. He became the first director of the Harvard Observatory in 1847 and was elected an associate of Britain’s Royal Astronomical Society two years later, the first American so honoured.
In 1848 Bond undertook extensive studies of the Orion Nebula and Saturn, and that year he discovered Hyperion in collaboration with his son. (The English astronomer William Lassell independently discovered Hyperion the same night as did the Bonds.) The Bonds made the first recognizable daguerreotype of the Moon and of a star (Vega) in 1850. That same year, they discovered the dark inner ring of Saturn (the Crepe Ring), which Lassell discovered independently only a few nights later. The Bonds made the first recognizable photographic print of the Moon in 1857. After William died in 1859, his son George Phillips succeeded him as director of the Harvard Observatory.
