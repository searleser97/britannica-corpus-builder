Cygnus,  uncrewed spacecraft developed by the American firm Orbital Sciences Corporation to carry supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). In 2008 Orbital Sciences was contracted by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to build Cygnus to resupply the ISS after the end of the space shuttle program, which concluded in 2011. The first Cygnus test flight, which carried only a small amount of supplies, launched on September 18, 2013.
Cygnus is a cylindrical spacecraft divided into two modules: the forward Pressurized Cargo Module, which holds the supplies for the ISS, and the rear Service Module, which contains the propulsion system. The Pressurized Cargo Module is based upon the Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules, which were used by the space shuttle to carry supplies to the ISS. Cygnus is powered by a pair of solar arrays attached to the Service Module. The second Cygnus flight brought 1,261 kg (2,780 pounds) of cargo to the ISS. Beginning with the fifth Cygnus flight, an enhanced version of the craft that was 1.2 metres (4 feet) longer and carried about 3,500 kg (7,700 pounds) of cargo was used.
Cygnus is launched by an Antares launch vehicle (also developed by Orbital Sciences) from Wallops Island, Virginia. Cygnus does not dock directly with the ISS but is moved to its docking position by the ISS’s robotic arm. At the end of its mission, Cygnus is filled with waste and burns up when it reenters Earth’s atmosphere.
