Flash spectrum,   array of wavelengths detectable in the emissions from the limb of the Sun during the flash periods of a few seconds just after the beginning of totality during a solar eclipse or just before the instant of its termination. When the solar photosphere is occulted by the Moon, the layers of the Sun’s atmosphere flash into prominence, and the spectrum briefly shows the bright lines produced by tenuous hot luminous gas. Except during eclipses, this part of the spectrum is masked by the glare of the Sun’s disk. Study of the flash spectrum gives information about the physical state of the solar chromosphere. The flash spectrum was first observed by the American astronomer Charles Augustus Young during the eclipse of Dec. 22, 1870.
