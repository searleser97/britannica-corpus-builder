Sagittarius A*,  supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy, located in the constellation Sagittarius. It is a strong source of radio waves and is embedded in the larger Sagittarius A complex. Most of the radio radiation is from a synchrotron mechanism, indicating the presence of free electrons and magnetic fields. Sagittarius A* is a compact, extremely bright point source. X-ray, infrared, spectroscopic, and radio interferometric investigations have indicated the very small dimensions of this region. Infrared observations of stars orbiting the position of Sagittarius A* demonstrate the presence of a black hole with a mass equivalent to 4,310,000 Suns. (For these infrared observations, American astronomer Andrea Ghez and German astronomer Reinhard Genzel were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for Physics.) These properties are similar to those of other galaxies with active nuclei (e.g., Seyfert galaxies) but on a smaller scale.
