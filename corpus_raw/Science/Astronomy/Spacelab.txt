Spacelab,  European-built system of pressurized modules that was used on 16 space shuttle missions from 1983 to 1998. These modules were carried in the space shuttle’s payload bay.
In 1973 the European Space Research Organisation (which became the European Space Agency [ESA] in 1975) suggested it develop a “Research and Applications Module” as its principal contribution to space shuttle operations. At that time the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) predicted the need for six modules. Europe was to fund the development and donate one module to NASA in return for an opportunity for its scientists to fly on the inaugural mission. The cost was to be recovered by producing the other five modules, which NASA would buy. However, the shuttle failed to achieve the expected flight rate, and NASA bought the single module that it was obliged to accept and canceled its options for the others. (ESA had also built a second module for its own use, which was later purchased by NASA.) The first flight was in 1983, with West German physicist Ulf Merbold as the European payload specialist. The cost of flying the shuttle proved so great that ESA eventually concluded that it could not afford to fund its own missions, so multinational missions were flown with U.S., Canadian, European, and Japanese programs sharing the cost.
Altogether, 25 flights were made with Spacelab for astronomical, solar, microgravity, life sciences, and materials sciences research. (Nine flights carried only unpressurized modules called pallets.) The advent of the International Space Station (ISS) rendered Spacelab obsolete, and the last flight of a pressurized module took place in April–May 1998. Pallets were still used to carry components to the ISS; the last such mission, in March 2008, carried the Canadian robot manipulator Dextre.
