Solar wind,  flux of particles, chiefly protons and electrons together with nuclei of heavier elements in smaller numbers, that are accelerated by the high temperatures of the solar corona, or outer region of the Sun, to velocities large enough to allow them to escape from the Sun’s gravitational field. The solar wind is responsible for creating the tail of Earth’s magnetosphere and the tails of comets, both of which face away from the Sun. At a distance of one astronomical unit (AU; the mean distance between Earth and the Sun, about 150 million km [93 million miles]), during a relatively quiet period, the wind contains approximately 1 to 10 protons per cubic centimetre moving outward from the Sun at velocities of 350 to 700 km (about 220 to 440 miles) per second; this creates a positive ion flux of 108 to 109 ions per square centimetre per second, each ion having an energy equal to at least 15 electron volts. During solar flares, the proton velocity, flux, plasma temperature, and associated turbulence increase substantially.
There are two solar winds: a fast, uniform, and steady wind, blowing at 800 km (500 miles) per second, and a slow, gusty, and sporadic wind, with about half the speed of the fast one. The two winds originate at different places on the Sun and accelerate to terminal velocity at different distances from it. The distribution of the two solar wind sources depends on the 11-year solar activity cycle.
When the solar wind encounters Earth’s magnetic field, a shock wave results, the nature of which is not fully understood. As the solar wind spreads out into an increasing volume, its density and pressure become less. Eventually the pressure of the solar wind becomes comparable to that of the interstellar medium. The termination shock, where the solar wind slows because it encounters the interstellar medium, has been measured at about 94 and 84 AU by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, respectively.
