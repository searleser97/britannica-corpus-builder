Sputnik,      any of a series of three artificial Earth satellites, the first of whose launch by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, inaugurated the space age. Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite launched, was a 83.6-kg (184-pound) capsule. It achieved an Earth orbit with an apogee (farthest point from Earth) of 940 km (584 miles) and a perigee (nearest point) of 230 km (143 miles), circling Earth every 96 minutes and remaining in orbit until January 4, 1958, when it fell back and burned in Earth’s atmosphere. The launch of Sputnik 1 shocked many Americans, who had assumed that their country was technologically ahead of the Soviet Union, and led to the “space race” between the two countries.
  Sputnik 2, launched on November 3, 1957, carried the dog Laika, the first living creature to be shot into space and orbit Earth. Laika was a stray dog found on the streets of Moscow. There were no plans to return her to Earth, and she lived only a few hours in orbit. Sputnik 3, launched on May 15, 1958, carried 12 instruments to study Earth’s upper atmosphere and space and was also the heaviest satellite to that time, weighing 1,327 kg (2,926 pounds). Sputnik 3 was originally intended to be the first satellite, but its complexity and size led the Soviets to launch the much simpler Sputnik 1 to beat the United States into space.
The Soviets officially called only three satellites Sputnik. In the West, however, Sputnik was used as a generic name for Soviet satellites. These “Sputniks” included the first probes to Venus (Venera 1) and Mars (Mars 1), as well as five missions in the Korabl-Sputnik program, which tested the crewed Vostok spacecraft before Yuri Gagarin’s flight in 1961.
