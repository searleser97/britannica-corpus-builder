Mary Watson Whitney,  (born Sept. 11, 1847, Waltham, Mass., U.S.—died Jan. 20, 1921, Waltham), American astronomer who built Vassar College’s research program in astronomy into one of the nation’s finest.
Whitney graduated from public high school in 1863 and entered Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York, with advanced standing in 1865. She immediately came under the influence of the astronomer Maria Mitchell. After graduating in 1868 Whitney returned to Waltham for a time to care for her widowed mother, then taught school in Auburndale, Massachusetts. In 1869 she traveled to Burlington, Iowa, to observe a solar eclipse with her own three-inch Alvan Clark telescope. From 1869 to 1870 she attended, on invitation, Benjamin Peirce’s class in quaternions at Harvard and his private class in celestial mechanics. In 1872 Vassar granted her a master’s degree. She then studied mathematics and celestial mechanics at the University of Zürich, Switzerland (1873–76).
Whitney taught at Waltham High School (1876–81) before returning to Vassar as Maria Mitchell’s assistant. In 1888 she succeeded Mitchell as professor of astronomy and director of the college observatory. Whitney proved to be a popular and effective teacher. Her determination to demonstrate the capacity of women to work in the sciences on equal terms with men led to her development of an ambitious program of research at Vassar, concentrating in particular on double stars, variable stars, asteroids, comets, and the precise measurement of photographic plates. With such training, her students were able to find professional positions in observatories across the country. In 1899 Whitney was a founding member of the American Astronomical Society. She retired from Vassar for health reasons in 1910.
