Bonner Durchmusterung (BD),  English Bonn Survey,  star catalog showing the positions and apparent magnitudes of 324,188 northern stars. Compiled at Bonn under the direction of the German astronomer F.W.A. Argelander, it required 25 years’ work and was published in 1859–62. The accompanying charts, published in 1863, were the most complete and accurate made until that time. The catalog, which consisted of 325,037 stars in 1989, was periodically updated and reissued.
