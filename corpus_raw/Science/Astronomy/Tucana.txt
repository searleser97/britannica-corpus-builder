This constellation contains the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite of the Milky Way Galaxy and one of the nearest galaxies to Earth at a distance of 190,000 light-years, as well as 47 Tucanae, the second brightest globular cluster after Omega Centauri. Tucana was invented by Pieter Dircksz Keyser, a navigator who joined the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies in 1595 and who added 12 new constellations in the southern skies. This constellation represents the toucan, a large-billed tropical American bird.
