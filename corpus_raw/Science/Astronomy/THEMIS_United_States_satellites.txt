THEMIS, in full Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions During Substorms,  five U.S. satellites that studied variations in the aurora. The spacecraft were launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Feb. 17, 2007. By following elliptical orbits whose orientation shifted relative to Earth, the Sun, and Earth’s radiation belts, they helped unravel the origin of disturbances in Earth’s magnetosphere, called substorms, that cause spectacular auroral displays. The mission also involved an array of ground stations. THEMIS found that substorms occur about 120,000 km (75,000 miles) from the surface of Earth when magnetic field lines break and release energy after they reconnect.
The two outermost satellites were given a new mission—Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS)—to study the space environment near the Moon. On July 20, 2009, the ARTEMIS satellites started on a trajectory by which they would arrive at the second and first Lagrangian points in August and October 2010, respectively, and ultimately enter lunar orbit in April 2011.
