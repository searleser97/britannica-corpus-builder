Crab Nebula,  (catalog numbers NGC 1952 and M1), probably the most intensely studied bright nebula, in the constellation Taurus, about 6,500 light-years from Earth. Roughly 10 light-years in diameter, it is assumed to be the remnant of a supernova (violently exploding star) observed by Chinese and other astronomers first on July 4, 1054. The supernova was visible in daylight for 23 days and at night for almost 2 years. There are no records of its observation at the time by Europeans.
The discovery of the object as a nebula is attributed to the English physician and amateur astronomer John Bevis in about 1731. In 1758 it was the first object listed (M1) in Charles Messierâ€™s catalog of nebulous objects. It acquired its name, suggested by its form, in the mid-19th century. In 1921 it was discovered to be still expanding; the present rate is about 1,100 km (700 miles) per second.
The Crab is one of the few astronomical objects from which radiation has been detected over the entire measurable spectrum, from radio waves through infrared and visible wavelengths to ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. In the late 1960s the Crab pulsar (NP 0532), thought to be the collapsed remnant of the supernova, was discovered near the centre of the nebula. The pulsar, which flashes in radio, visible, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths at 30 times per second, provides the energy that allows the nebula to glow.
