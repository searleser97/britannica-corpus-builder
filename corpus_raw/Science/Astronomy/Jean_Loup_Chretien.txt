Jean-Loup Chrétien,  (born Aug. 20, 1938, La Rochelle, France), French astronaut who was the first person from western Europe to go into space, aboard a Soviet flight to the Salyut 7 space station in June 1982. Chrétien flew a second Soviet mission to space station Mir in 1988 and then returned to Mir as a U.S.-trained astronaut aboard the space shuttle in 1997.
Chrétien graduated in 1961 from the French Air Force Academy at Salon-de-Provence in southeastern France. He ultimately became a brigadier general in the French air force. In 1962 he began his career as a fighter pilot and then a test pilot, and in 1980 he was assigned to the French space agency, Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES). After his 1982 Salyut flight he served as head of the CNES astronaut office, and he began training for a flight aboard the space shuttle in 1984–85. His flight opportunity was postponed after the Challenger accident of 1986. After his first flight to Mir in 1988, Chrétien participated in training as a pilot of the Soviet space shuttle Buran in 1990–93 before that program was canceled.
Chrétien returned to astronaut training with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1995. In addition to his 1997 flight to Mir, he worked closely with NASA on overall U.S.-Russian cooperative activities. An off-duty accident forced Chrétien to retire as an astronaut in 2001. He became senior vice president of research and development at Tietronix, a software engineering firm in Houston, Texas, and in 2002 he founded Tietronix Optics, an optical technology company in Lannion, France.
