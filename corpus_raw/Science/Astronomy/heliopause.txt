Heliopause,  boundary of the heliosphere, the spherical region around the Sun that is filled with solar magnetic fields and the outward-moving solar wind consisting of protons and electrons. Nearer the Sun than the heliopause lies the heliosheath, a region of transition where the solar wind slows to subsonic speeds—that is, slower than the speed with which disturbances travel through the interstellar medium. The heliopause is about 123 astronomical units (AU; 18 billion km [11 billion miles]) from the Sun. The shape of the heliopause fluctuates and is influenced by a wind of interstellar gas caused by the Sun’s motion through space. The orbits of all the major planets, including Earth’s, lie well within the heliopause. The only spacecraft to cross the heliopause were Voyager 1 and 2, which were launched in 1977 and reached it in 2012 and 2018, respectively.  The Voyagers discovered the location of the heliopause by observing an increase of galactic cosmic-ray particles and a decrease in solar wind particles after they passed through the boundary.
