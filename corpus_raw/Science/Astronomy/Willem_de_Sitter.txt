Willem de Sitter,  (born May 6, 1872, Sneek, Neth.—died  Nov. 20, 1934, Leiden), Dutch mathematician, astronomer, and cosmologist who developed theoretical models of the universe based on Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
De Sitter studied mathematics at the State University of Groningen and then joined the astronomical laboratory there, where under J.C. Kapteyn’s guidance he developed a liking for astronomy. He spent the years 1897–99 at the Cape Observatory in South Africa and devoted himself to astronomy thereafter. In 1908 de Sitter became professor of astronomy at the University of Leiden, and in 1919 he became director of the Leiden Observatory.
In his early career de Sitter analyzed the motions of Jupiter’s four great Galilean satellites in order to determine their masses. His experience in celestial mechanics proved useful in 1916–17, when he published a series of papers in London in which he described the astronomical consequences of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. His papers aroused British interest in the theory and led directly to Arthur Eddington’s 1919 expedition to observe a solar eclipse in order to measure the gravitational deflection of light rays passing near the Sun.
De Sitter’s concept of the universe differed in some respects from that of Einstein. Einstein’s relativistic conception of curved space led him to envision the universe as static and unchanging in size, but de Sitter maintained that relativity actually implied that the universe was constantly expanding. This view was later supported by Edwin Hubble’s observations of distant galaxies and was eventually adopted by Einstein himself. De Sitter’s calculations of the size of the universe and the number of galaxies contained in it subsequently proved to be too small.
