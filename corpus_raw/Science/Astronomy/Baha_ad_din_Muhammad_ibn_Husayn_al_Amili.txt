Bahāʾ ad-dīn Muḥammad ibn Ḥusayn al-ʿĀmilī, also called Shaykh Bahāʾī,  (born March 20, 1546, Baalbek, Syria—died  Aug. 20, 1622, Iran), theologian, mathematician, jurist, and astronomer who was a major figure in the cultural revival of Ṣafavid Iran.
Al-ʿĀmilī was educated by his father, Shaykh Ḥusayn, a Shīʿite theologian, and by excellent teachers of mathematics and medicine. After his family left Syria in 1559 to escape persecution by the Ottoman Turks, al-ʿĀmilī lived in Herāt (now in Afghanistan) and Isfahan, Iran. He attached himself to the court of ʿAbbās I the Great, serving for many years as the shaykh al-Islām (chief judge of the Muslim court of law) of Eṣfahān, and writing during that time a treatise on Shīʿite jurisprudence and its application in Iran (Jāmiʿe Abbāsī). He made a pilgrimage to Mecca and visited with many scholars, doctors, and mystics on a homeward journey that took him to Iraq, Egypt, the Hejaz, and Palestine.
In his poetry al-ʿĀmilī expounded complex mystical doctrines in simple and unadorned verse. His best-known poem, Nān u-ḥalwā (“Bread and Sweets”), describes the experiences of an itinerant holy man who may well be al-ʿĀmilī himself on the Mecca pilgrimage. Kashkūl (“The Beggar’s Bowl”), containing both stories and verses, was translated widely. His major work of astronomy is Tashrīhuʾl-aflāk (“Anatomy of the Heavens”).
Al-ʿĀmilī was responsible for the revival of mathematical sciences in Iran, the study of which had been neglected for more than 100 years. His Khulāṣat al-ḥisāb (“The Essentials of Arithmetic”), written in Arabic, was translated several times into Persian and German. The work was a standard textbook until the beginning of the 20th century.
