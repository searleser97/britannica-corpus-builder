X-ray astronomy,  Study of astronomical objects and phenomena that emit radiation at X-ray wavelengths. Because Earthâ€™s atmosphere absorbs most X-rays, X-ray telescopes and detectors are taken to high altitudes or into space by balloons and spacecraft. In 1949 detectors aboard sounding rockets showed that the Sun gives off X-rays, but it is a weak source; it took 30 more years to clearly detect X-rays from other ordinary stars. Beginning with the Uhuru X-ray satellite (launched 1970), a succession of space observatories carried increasingly sophisticated instruments into Earth orbit. Astronomers discovered that most types of stars emit X-rays but usually as a tiny fraction of their energy output. Supernova remnants are more powerful X-ray sources; the strongest sources known in the Milky Way Galaxy are certain binary stars in which one star is probably a black hole. In addition to myriad point sources, astronomers have found a diffuse background of X-ray radiation emanating from all directions; unlike cosmic background radiation, it appears to have many distant individual sources. The Chandra X-Ray Observatory and XMM-Newton X-ray satellite (both launched 1999) have made numerous discoveries relating to the nature and quantity of black holes in the universe, the evolution of stars and galaxies, and the composition and activity of supernova remnants.
