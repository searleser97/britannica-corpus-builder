Beta Lyrae,  eclipsing binary star, the two component stars of which are so close together that they are greatly distorted by their mutual attraction; they exchange material and share a common atmosphere. Beta Lyrae is a member of a class of binary systems known as W Serpentis stars. It is of about third magnitude and lies in the northern constellation Lyra.
The variable character of Beta Lyrae was discovered in 1784 by the English amateur astronomer John Goodricke. Its period of about 13 days is increasing by about 19 seconds per year, probably because the stars are steadily losing mass to a continually expanding gaseous ring surrounding them.
