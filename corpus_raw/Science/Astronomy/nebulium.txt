Nebulium,   hypothetical chemical element whose existence was suggested in 1868 by the English astronomer Sir William Huggins as one possible explanation for the presence of unidentified (forbidden) lines (at 3,726, 3,729, 4,959, and 5,007 angstroms wavelength) in the spectra of gaseous nebulae. In 1927 the American physicist and astronomer Ira S. Bowen correctly determined that the common elements oxygen and nitrogen ionized (i.e., electrically charged) under conditions unobtainable on Earth are responsible for these spectral lines. See also forbidden lines.
