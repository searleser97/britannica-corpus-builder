Jocelyn Bell Burnell, née Susan Jocelyn Bell,  (born July 15, 1943, Belfast, Northern Ireland), British astronomer who discovered pulsars, the cosmic sources of peculiar radio pulses.
She attended the University of Glasgow, where she received a bachelor’s degree (1965) in physics. She proceeded to the University of Cambridge, where she was awarded a doctorate (1969) in radio astronomy. As a research assistant at Cambridge, she aided in constructing a large radio telescope and in 1967, while reviewing the printouts of her experiments monitoring quasars, discovered a series of extremely regular radio pulses. Puzzled, she consulted her adviser, astrophysicist Antony Hewish, and their team spent the ensuing months eliminating possible sources of the pulses, which they jokingly dubbed LGM (for Little Green Men) in reference to the remote possibility that they represented attempts at communication by extraterrestrial intelligence. After monitoring the pulses using more sensitive equipment, the team discovered several more regular patterns of radio waves and determined that they were in fact emanating from rapidly spinning neutron stars, which were later called pulsars by the press.
The 1974 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Hewish and Martin Ryle for the discovery of pulsars. Several prominent scientists protested the omission of Bell Burnell, though she maintained that the prize was presented appropriately given her student status at the time of the discovery. Subsequent to her discovery, Bell Burnell taught at the University of Southampton (1970–73) before becoming a professor at University College London (1974–82). She also taught at the Open University (1973–87) and worked at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh (1982–91), before serving as professor of physics at the Open University (1991–2001). Bell Burnell was then appointed dean of science at the University of Bath (2001–04), after which she accepted a post as visiting professor at Oxford.
Bell Burnell was created Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1999 and Dame (DBE) in 2007. Bell Burnell became a member of the Royal Society in 2003. She also served as president of the Royal Astronomical Society (2002–04) and was elected to a two-year term as president of the Institute of Physics in 2008.
