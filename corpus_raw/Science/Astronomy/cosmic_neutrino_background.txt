Cosmic neutrino background,  low-energy neutrinos that pervade the universe. When the universe was one second old, it had cooled enough that neutrinos no longer interacted with ordinary matter. These neutrinos now form the cosmic neutrino background.
The theoretical basis of the cosmic neutrino background rests with the notion that a hot big bang would produce not only a primeval fireball of electromagnetic radiation but also enormous numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos (both referred to in cosmological discussions as neutrinos for brevityâ€™s sake). Estimates suggest that every cubic metre of space in the universe contains about 108 low-energy neutrinos. This number considerably exceeds the cosmological density of atomic nuclei (mostly hydrogen) obtained by averaging the known matter in the universe over scales of hundreds of millions of light-years. The latter density amounts to less than one particle per cubic metre of space. Nevertheless, because neutrinos interact with matter only weakly (they do not, for example, emit electromagnetic radiation), they can be detected experimentally by sophisticated instruments only if they have relatively high energies (such as the neutrinos from the Sun or from supernova explosions). However, precise observations by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe revealed the effects of the cosmic neutrino background through its effects on the cosmic microwave background.
