Caloris,  prominent multiringed impact basin on Mercury. The ramparts of Caloris are about 1,550 km (960 miles) across. Its interior contains extensively ridged and fractured plains. The largest ridges are a few hundred kilometres long. More than 200 fractures comparable to the ridges in size radiate from Caloris’s centre.
Two types of terrain surround Caloris—the rim and the ejecta terrains. The rim is a ring of irregular mountains almost 3 km (2 miles) in height, the highest mountains yet seen on Mercury. A second, much smaller escarpment ring stands beyond the first. Smooth plains occupy the depressions between mountains. Beyond the outer escarpment is a zone of linear radial ridges and valleys that are partially filled by plains. Volcanism played a prominent role in forming many of these plains.
Caloris is one of the youngest large multiring basins. It probably was formed at the same time as the last giant basins on the Moon, about 3.9 billion years ago.
On the other side of the planet, exactly opposite Caloris, is a region of weirdly contorted terrain. It likely formed at the same time as the Caloris impact by the focusing of seismic waves from that event.
