Hydrus, (Greek: “Water Snake”)  constellation in the southern sky at about 2 hours right ascension and 70° south in declination. Its brightest star is Beta Hydri, with a magnitude of 2.8. This constellation was invented by Pieter Dircksz Keyser, a navigator who joined the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies in 1595 and who added 12 new constellations in the southern skies. The much larger constellation Hydra represents a female water snake, whereas Hydrus is the male.
