Moon,  any natural satellite orbiting another body. In the solar system there are 173 moons orbiting the planets. Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have 1, 2, 67, 62, 27, and 14 moons, respectively. Other bodies in the solar system, such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects, also have moons. No moons have yet been discovered around extrasolar planets. The solar system’s moons range in size from tens of metres across, the diameter of small bodies in orbit around asteroids, to 5,262 km (3,270 miles), the diameter of Jupiter’s moon Ganymede.
Some moons are of interest because they have conditions that may be favourable for life. For example, Jupiter’s moon Europa has an ocean underneath its icy surface. Saturn’s moon Enceladus has geysers that spew out water and organic molecules.
