Thor rocket,  missile initially developed by the U.S. Air Force as an intermediate-range ballistic missile. It was subsequently modified to serve as the first stage of launch vehicles for several spacecraft. The Thor missile force was withdrawn in 1963. Propelled by liquid oxygen and kerosene, the basic rocket was 65 feet (19.8 m) in length, with a body diameter of 8 feet (2.4 m), weight at firing of 110,000 pounds (49,900 kg), and speed at burnout of 7,670 to 11,505 miles (12,300 to 18,500 km) per hour.
For space launching, three additional small auxiliary motors were strapped to a Thor rocket used as a first stage, resulting in the Thrust-Augmented Thor (TAT), nearly twice as powerful as the original Thor. Total thrust at lift-off was 330,000 pounds. Adding an Agena rocket as a second stage resulted in the two-stage Thor–Agena rocket, used to launch the Air Force’s Discoverer space satellites.
Long Tank Thor, an advanced version of the Thor space launch vehicle, first appeared in the summer of 1966. It was capable of placing 20 percent heavier military payloads into space than TAT, had an overall length of 70.5 feet, and a body diameter of 8 feet.
