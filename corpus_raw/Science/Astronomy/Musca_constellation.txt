Musca, (Latin: “Fly”)  constellation in the southern sky at about 13 hours right ascension and 70° south in declination. Its brightest star is Alpha Muscae, with a magnitude of 2.7. This constellation was invented by Pieter Dircksz Keyser, a navigator who joined the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies in 1595 and who added 12 new constellations in the southern skies. However, it was originally called Apis (Latin: “Bee”); it was dubbed Musca by the Dutch cartographer Willem Janszoon Blaeu in 1603.
