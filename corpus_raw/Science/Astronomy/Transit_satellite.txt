Transit,  any of the first series of U.S. navigation satellites. Launched by the U.S. Navy from 1960 to 1988, the Transit satellites were developed to provide an accurate all-weather navigational aid for seagoing vessels (particularly submarines) and aircraft. The system was so designed that any such craft could pinpoint its position by using a computer specially programmed to translate coded radio signals beamed from the satellites into latitude and longitude.
Transit 1-B, the first in the series, was placed in a north-south polar orbit on April 13, 1960. It had only a 40-month life-span, however. Three advanced Transit models equipped with nuclear-power generators were launched from June 22, 1960, to Nov. 15, 1961. In 1997 Transit was replaced as a means of navigation by the Global Positioning System (GPS); the satellites then became the Navy Ionospheric Monitoring System and studied Earthâ€™s upper atmosphere.
