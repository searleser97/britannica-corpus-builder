Vesta,  second largest—and the brightest—asteroid of the asteroid belt and the fourth such object to be discovered, by the German astronomer and physician Wilhelm Olbers on March 29, 1807. It is named for the ancient Roman goddess of the hearth (the Greek Hestia).
Vesta revolves around the Sun once in 3.63 years in a nearly circular moderately inclined (7.1°) orbit at a mean distance of 2.36 astronomical units (AU; about 353 million km [219 million miles]). It has an ellipsoidal shape with radial dimensions of 286 × 279 × 223 km (178 × 173 × 139 miles), equivalent to a sphere with a diameter of 526 km (327 miles)—i.e., about 15 percent of the diameter of Earth’s Moon. Although Vesta is only about half the size of the largest asteroid, the dwarf planet Ceres, it is about four times as reflective (Vesta’s albedo, averaged over its rotation, is 0.40, compared with 0.10 for Ceres), and it orbits closer (Ceres’s mean distance is 2.77 AU). Vesta is the only main-belt asteroid visible to the unaided eye. Its mass is about 2.6 × 1020 kg, and its density is 3.46 grams per cubic cm (about the same as that of the Moon). It rotates once in 5.3 hours.
The U.S. spacecraft Dawn went into orbit around Vesta on July 16, 2011, and left on September 5, 2012, for a rendezvous with Ceres. During its time at Vesta, Dawn discovered much about the asteroid’s topography and composition.
Among Dawn’s discoveries was that Vesta is among the most-rugged bodies in the solar system relative to its size; its topography is more varied than the Moon’s or Mercury’s. Vesta’s most-prominent surface feature is the large impact basin Rheasilvia at the south pole, which is 505 km (310 miles) across. At an age of about one billion years, Rheasilvia is unusually young for such a large crater, and its central peak is 20 km (12 miles) high, making it one of the tallest mountains in the solar system and about twice the height of Earth’s largest mountain, the island of Hawaii (whose height, measured from the ocean floor, is 9.8 km [6.1 miles]). Vesta has several long sets of grooves called fossae, one of which, Divalia Fossa, stretches more than halfway around the asteroid’s equator. The asteroid also has several large impact craters, three of which—Marcia, Calpurnia, and Minucia—form a snowmanlike arrangement.
Unlike most other asteroids, Vesta actually is a protoplanet—that is, not a body that is just a giant rock but one that has an internal structure and that would have formed a planet had accretion continued. Vesta is the parent body of the meteorites known as basaltic achondrite HEDs (a grouping of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite types).
