CoRoT, in full Convection, Rotation and Planetary Transits,  French satellite that studied the internal structure of stars and detected extrasolar planets. It was launched on December 27, 2006, by a Soyuz launch vehicle from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. It operated until November 2, 2012, when its computer malfunctioned, and it was unable to return data to Earth. After months of attempts to fix the computer, ground controllers shut down CoRoT on June 18, 2013.
CoRoT carried a telescope 27 cm (11 inches) in diameter and was in a circular polar orbit 896 km (557 miles) above the surface of Earth. The satellite studied the internal structure of stars through the faint changes of brightness that a star undergoes when it oscillates. CoRoT observed its target stars continuously for up to 180 days at a time. It detected extrasolar planets through their transits—that is, when those planets pass in front of their stars.
During its mission, CoRoT discovered 34 planets. One of them, CoRoT-7b, has a radius of 10,700 km (6,600 miles), 1.68 times that of Earth, and a mass 4.8 times that of Earth. Such extrasolar planets have been called “super-Earths.” Its density is similar to that of Earth, and thus it is a rocky planet like Earth, the first such planet to be confirmed.
Another CoRoT discovery, CoRoT-2b, has a mass 22 times that of Jupiter and orbits its star every 4.26 days. CoRoT-2b is either a very large planet or a small brown dwarf with an unusually small orbital period.
