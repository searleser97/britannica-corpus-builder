Jim Lovell, byname of James Arthur Lovell, Jr.,  (born March 25, 1928, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.), U.S. astronaut of the Gemini and Apollo space programs, commander of the nearly disastrous Apollo 13 flight to the Moon in 1970.
Lovell, a graduate (1952) of the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, became a test pilot. He was serving as a flight instructor and safety officer at the time (1963) he was selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the crewed space program. Lovell accompanied Frank Borman on the record-breaking 14-day flight of Gemini 7. Launched December 4, 1965, Gemini 7 was joined in space by Gemini 6, launched 11 days later and crewed by Walter M. Schirra, Jr., and Thomas P. Stafford, for the first successful space rendezvous. Lovell joined Edwin E. (“Buzz”) Aldrin for the last flight of the Gemini series, Gemini 12, which was launched on November 11, 1966, and remained in orbit for four days.
Apollo 8 was launched on December 21, 1968, and carried Lovell, Borman, and William Anders on the first crewed flight around the Moon. This flight was the first of three preparatory to the Moon landing of Apollo 11. Apollo 13, with astronauts Fred W. Haise, John L. Swigert, Jr., and Lovell aboard, lifted off on April 11, 1970, headed for the Fra Mauro Hills on the Moon. On April 13, approximately 205,000 miles (330,000 km) from Earth, an explosion ruptured an oxygen tank in the service module. The resulting shortage of power and oxygen forced the abandonment of the Moon mission. Apollo 13’s crew changed course to swing once around the Moon and then return to Earth. With the successful return of Apollo 13 on April 17, Lovell had completed more than 715 hours of space travel.
Lovell remained in NASA, and in 1971 he became a deputy director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. He retired from the navy and the space program in 1973 but remained in Houston as a corporation executive until his retirement in 1991. He later moved to Illinois and opened a successful restaurant in Lake Forest.
