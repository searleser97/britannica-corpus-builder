William Wallace Campbell,  (born April 11, 1862, Hancock county, Ohio, U.S.—died  June 14, 1938, San Francisco, Calif.), astronomer known particularly for his spectrographic determinations of the radial velocities of stars—i.e., their motions toward the Earth or away from it. In addition, he discovered many spectroscopic binary stars, and in 1924 he published a catalog listing more than 1,000 of them.
To include measurements of radial velocities of stars visible only from the Southern Hemisphere, Campbell sent a 36-inch telescope, equipped with spectrograph, to Santiago, Chile. Combining data from Lick Observatory, Mt. Hamilton, California, and from Santiago, he determined the direction and speed of the Sun’s motion in the Galaxy as well as the average random velocities of stars of various spectral types. He led seven solar eclipse expeditions from Lick and brought back a wealth of material on the Sun’s corona and flash spectrum.
Campbell joined the staff at Lick Observatory in 1890, after two years as an instructor in astronomy at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. He became director of Lick in 1901. From 1923 to 1930 he was president of the University of California. He was president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1931 to 1935.
