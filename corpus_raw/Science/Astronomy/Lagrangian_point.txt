Lagrangian point,  in astronomy, a point in space at which a small body, under the gravitational influence of two large ones, will remain approximately at rest relative to them. The existence of such points was deduced by the French mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange in 1772. In 1906 the first examples were discovered: these were the Trojan asteroids moving in Jupiter’s orbit, under the influence of Jupiter and the Sun.
In each system of two heavy bodies (e.g., Sun-Jupiter or Earth-Moon), there exist five theoretical Lagrangian points, but only two, the fourth (L4) and fifth (L5), are stable—i.e., will tend to retain small bodies despite slight perturbations by outside gravitational influences. Each stable point forms one tip of an equilateral triangle having the two massive bodies at the other vertices. In the Earth-Sun system the first (L1) and second (L2) Lagrangian points, which occur some 1,500,000 km (900,000 miles) from Earth toward and away from the Sun, respectively, are home to satellites. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory is at L1, because that point allows continuous study of the Sun. The Gaia satellite is in orbit around L2, because such an orbit minimizes the temperature changes that the satellite experiences.
