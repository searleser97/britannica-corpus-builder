Jeremiah Horrocks, Horrocks also spelled Horrox,  (born 1618, Toxteth Park, near Liverpool [now in Merseyside], England—died January 3, 1641, Toxteth Park), British astronomer and clergyman who applied Johannes Kepler’s laws of planetary motion to the Moon and whose observations of a transit of Venus (1639) are the first recorded.
Horrocks studied at the University of Cambridge from 1632 to 1635; he then became a tutor at Toxteth and studied astronomy in his spare time. He was ordained to the curacy of Hoole, Lancashire, in 1639. The transit of Venus, which had been overlooked in Kepler’s tables but which Horrocks had predicted, took place on Sunday, November 24 (Old Style), and he observed it between church services.
He showed the Moon’s orbit to be approximately elliptical, thus making a partial basis for Sir Isaac Newton’s later work. Horrocks also studied tides and the mutual perturbation of Jupiter and Saturn. He calculated an improved value of 14 minutes for the solar parallax, a measure of the Earth’s mean distance from the Sun, and suggested correctly that the Sun had a perturbing effect on the Moon’s orbit.
