Forbush effect,  in geophysics, an occasional decrease in the intensity of cosmic rays as observed on Earth, attributed to magnetic effects produced by solar flares, which are disturbances on the Sun. The effect was discovered in 1937 by the American physicist Scott E. Forbush. Forbush observed that the intensity of cosmic rays reaching Earth was inversely correlated with the 11-year solar cycle of sunspot activity, in that there are more cosmic rays at the minimum of the cycle and fewer cosmic rays at the maximum. At maximum solar activity, stronger magnetic fields are carried out into interplanetary space by the solar wind, and these fields block the cosmic rays.
