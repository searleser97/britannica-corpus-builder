Franklin Chang-Díaz,  (born April 5, 1950, San José, Costa Rica), Costa Rican-born American physicist and the first Hispanic astronaut.
Chang-Díaz aspired to be an astronaut as a young child. In 1967 his parents sent him from Costa Rica to live with relatives in Connecticut. He earned a bachelor’s degree (1973) in mechanical engineering at the University of Connecticut and a doctorate (1977) in applied plasma physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In 1980 Chang-Díaz was selected to participate in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) astronaut program. He made seven spaceflights. His first mission was aboard the space shuttle Columbia in January 1986. Other shuttle flights included the Atlantis mission in October 1989, which deployed the Galileo spacecraft that explored Jupiter, and the June 2002 flight of Endeavour, during which he participated in three space walks to help repair the robotic arm of the International Space Station. Chang-Díaz was a visiting scientist (1983–93) at MIT, where he led a project that developed plasma propulsion for use in human flights to Mars. He served as director of NASA’s Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston from 1993 until 2005, when he retired from the agency.
Chang-Díaz subsequently founded and became president of the Ad Astra Rocket Company. He also taught at Rice University and the University of Houston.
