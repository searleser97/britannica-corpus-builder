Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE),  U.S. satellite observatory that observed the universe in far-ultraviolet light (wavelengths between 90.5 and 119.5 nanometres). FUSE was launched on June 24, 1999. One of its main aims was the study of hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) ratios in intergalactic clouds and interstellar clouds unaffected by star formation in an effort to determine the H-D ratio as it was shortly after the big bang; such a measurement allows the determination of the amount of baryons (heavy subatomic particles, which include protons and neutrons) in the universe. In its observations of the Milky Way Galaxy, FUSE discovered molecular nitrogen in the interstellar medium. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration shut down FUSE on Oct. 18, 2007, after eight years of operation, because it was running out of fuel for accurate pointing.
