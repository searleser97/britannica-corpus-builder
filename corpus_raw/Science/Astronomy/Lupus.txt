Lupus, (Latin: “Wolf”)  constellation in the southern sky at about 15 hours right ascension and 40° south in declination. Its brightest star is Alpha Lupi, with a magnitude of 2.3. For the ancient Greeks and Romans this constellation represented either a wolf or a fox impaled on a pole held by the nearby constellation Centaurus. The definite identification of this constellation with a wolf dates from the Latin version of Ptolemy’s Almagest (12th century).
