FAST, in full Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical radio Telescope,  astronomical observatory in the Dawodang depression, Guizhou province, China, that, when it began observations in September 2016, became the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world. FAST’s collecting area is more than 2.5 times that of the 305-metre (1,000-foot) dish at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. FAST is a spherical reflector 500 metres (1,600 feet) in diameter sitting in a natural depression. Because of its size, the dish itself does not move. However, the telescope is able to observe sources within 40 degrees of the zenith because the shape of the dish’s surface is changeable and because the feed cabin, where the radio waves are focused, is suspended from six cables and moves around the surface of the dish.
FAST is expected to map the neutral hydrogen gas in the Milky Way Galaxy at a very high resolution and to increase the number of known pulsars from almost 2,000 to about 6,000. It may be able to detect radio emissions from extrasolar planets that are similar to Jupiter, and it also should be able to search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence around many more stars than in previous surveys.
Construction began on FAST in 2011, and it became operational in 2016. The project was funded by the Chinese government, and FAST is operated by the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
