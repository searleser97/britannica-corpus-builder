Hendrik Christoffel van de Hulst,  (born November 19, 1918, Utrecht, Netherlandsâ€”died July 31, 2000, Leiden), Dutch astronomer who predicted theoretically the 21-cm (8.2-inch) radio waves produced by interstellar hydrogen atoms. His calculations later proved valuable in mapping the Milky Way Galaxy and were the basis for radio astronomy during its early development.
In 1944, while still a student, van de Hulst made theoretical studies of hydrogen atoms in space. The magnetic fields of the proton and electron in the hydrogen atom can align in either the same or opposite directions. Once every 10 million years or so a hydrogen atom will realign itself and, van de Hulst calculated, emit a radio wave with a 21-cm wavelength.
Van de Hulst was appointed a lecturer in astronomy at the University of Leiden in 1948 and four years later was made a professor there; he retired in 1984. In addition to his work in radio astronomy, he made valuable contributions to the understanding of light scattering by small particles, the solar corona, and interstellar clouds. Beginning in the 1960s van de Hulst became a leader in international and European space research and development efforts. His numerous awards include the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (1978).
