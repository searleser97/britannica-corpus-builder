Joseph-Nicolas Delisle,  (born April 4, 1688, Paris, France—died  Sept. 11, 1768, Paris), French astronomer who proposed that the series of coloured rings sometimes observed around the Sun is caused by diffraction of sunlight through water droplets in a cloud. He also worked to find the distance of the Sun from the Earth by observing transits of Venus and Mercury across the face of the Sun.
In 1725 Delisle went to St. Petersburg to establish an astronomical institute. Intending to be there only 4 years, he stayed for 22 and trained the first generation of Russian astronomers. His Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire et au progrès de l’astronomie (1738; “Memoirs Recounting the History and Progress of Astronomy”) gave the first method for determining the heliocentric (Sun-centred) coordinates of sunspots. He returned to Paris in 1747, was appointed geographic astronomer to the naval department, and installed an observatory in the Hôtel Cluny. In 1753 he organized a worldwide study of a transit of Venus (1761), the first such systematic study to be made.
