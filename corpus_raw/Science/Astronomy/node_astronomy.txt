Node,   in astronomy, the intersection of the orbit plane of some celestial body, such as the Moon, a planet, or comet, with the plane of the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun among the stars) as projected on the celestial sphere. The ascending node is the one where the body crosses from the south to the north side of the ecliptic, the opposite one being the descending node. An eclipse of the Sun or Moon can occur only when the Moon is at or near a node; similarly, only when one of the inner planets is at or near a node can it appear in transit across the Sun. See also orbit.
