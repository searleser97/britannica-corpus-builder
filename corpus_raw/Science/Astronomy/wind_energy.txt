Wind energy,  form of solar energy that is produced by the movement of air relative to Earth’s surface. This form of energy is generated by the uneven heating of Earth’s surface by the Sun and is modified by Earth’s rotation and surface topography. For an overview of the forces that govern the movement of air, see wind. For a description of the harnessing of the wind’s kinetic energy, see wind power.
