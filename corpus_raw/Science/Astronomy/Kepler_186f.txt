Kepler-186f,  the first Earth-sized extrasolar planet to be found within its star’s habitable zone—the orbital region where an Earth-like planet could possess liquid water on its surface and thus possibly support life. Kepler-186f was discovered in 2014 in data taken by the Kepler satellite before its mission ended the previous year. The planet has a radius 1.11 times that of Earth. The mass of Kepler-186f is unknown; however, if it has an Earth-like composition, its mass would be 1.44 times that of Earth. It was the fifth planet discovered around its star, a dim red dwarf 500 light-years from Earth with a mass 0.48 times that of the Sun. Kepler-186f orbits its star every 129.9 days at a distance of 53.2 million km (33.1 million miles). It receives only 32 percent of the amount of light that Earth receives from the Sun, but water could exist in a liquid state if its atmosphere has sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide. The other four planets in the system are Earth-sized; however, they orbit much closer to the star and thus are not within the habitable zone. Kepler-186f is far enough away from its star that it may not be tidally locked (i.e., its day may not be as long as its year, with one side always facing its star).
