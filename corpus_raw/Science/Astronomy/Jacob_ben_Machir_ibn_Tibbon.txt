Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon, also called Don Profiat,  (born c. 1236, Marseille—died c. 1312, Montpellier, Fr.), French Jewish physician, translator, and astronomer whose work was utilized by Copernicus and Dante. He was highly regarded as a physician and served as regent of the faculty of medicine at the University of Montpellier. He was the grandson of the renowned translator Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon.
Jacob translated into Hebrew a large number of works, including Arabic versions of Euclid’s Elements and Ptolemy’s encyclopaedic work on astronomy, the Almagest. He also translated Arabic works by al-Ghazālī (1058–1111) and Averroës.
As a student of astronomy, Jacob described a quadrant of his own invention. Adapted by mariners, it came to be known as “Quadrans Judaicus.” His book on astronomical tables, Luḥot (“Tables”), was utilized by Dante in his Divine Comedy.
He joined his cousin Judah ben Moses ibn Tibbon, who was a rabbi in Montpellier and also a translator, in actively supporting the followers of Maimonides; the Maimonists interpreted the Bible allegorically and studied science and philosophy.
