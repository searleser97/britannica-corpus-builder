Binary star,  pair of stars in orbit around their common centre of gravity. A high proportion, perhaps one-half, of all stars in the Milky Way Galaxy are binaries or members of more complex multiple systems. Although binary stars are sometimes called double stars, the latter refers to any two stars that are close together in the sky and thus includes true binaries as well as stars that look close together when viewed from Earth but which are actually quite far apart.
If the images of the two components of a binary star system can be separated by telescope, it is called a visual binary. Stars whose components are too close to each other to be distinguished visually can sometimes be identified as binaries by spectroscopic observation; as the members of these spectroscopic binaries move alternately toward Earth and away from it, a Doppler effect of frequency change is observed in their spectral lines. Binary stars are sometimes detectable by changes in apparent brightness, as the darker (or dimmer) star occludes its brighter companion; these are eclipsing variable stars. Some stellar systems with so-called invisible companions are binaries; these companions might be detected through changes in the proper motionâ€”that is, the rate of motion of the visible stars across the background of more distant stars.
