Comet Hale-Bopp,  long-period comet that was spectacularly visible to the naked eye, having a bright coma, a thick white dust tail, and a bright blue ion tail. It was discovered independently on July 23, 1995, by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp, two American amateur astronomers, at the unusually far distance of 7.15 astronomical units (AU; about 1 billion km [600 million miles]) from the Sun, well beyond Jupiter’s orbit. The comet reached perihelion (closest distance to the Sun) at 0.914 AU on April 1, 1997, without ever coming very close to Earth (nearest distance 1.31 AU [196 million km, or 122 million miles]), because the comet passed through perihelion on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth and its orbit was almost perpendicular to that of Earth. From the comet’s rate of gas production, its nucleus was estimated to be at least 30 km (20 miles) in diameter.
