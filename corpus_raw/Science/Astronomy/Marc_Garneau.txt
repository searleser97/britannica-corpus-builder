Marc Garneau,  (born February 23, 1949, Quebec city, Quebec, Canada), Canadian naval officer, astronaut, and politician who was the first Canadian citizen to go into space (1984).
Garneau received a B.S. in engineering physics from the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, in 1970 and a doctorate in electrical engineering from Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, England, in 1973. He served as a Canadian naval officer from 1974 to 1989. In 1983 he was selected as one of the first six Canadian astronauts. He became the first Canadian in space when he flew aboard the U.S. space shuttle as a payload specialist in October 1984; on that flight, he operated several Canadian experiments. In 1989 Garneau retired from the military and became deputy director of the Canadian astronaut program.
In 1992 Garneau began astronaut mission specialist training with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the United States. He made two more spaceflights in 1996 and 2000. On the 1996 STS-77 mission, Garneau once again was in charge of several Canadian experiments; on the STS-97 mission in 2000, which docked with the International Space Station (ISS), he operated the shuttle’s robotic arm to help deploy the first set of solar arrays for the ISS. In February 2001 he became executive vice president of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), and in November of that year he became the agency’s president.
Garneau resigned from the CSA in November 2005 in order to run for Parliament in the March 2006 election. He was defeated in that attempt but was later elected to Parliament in October 2008 as a member of the Liberal Party for the Montreal riding of Westmount–Ville-Marie. He represented that riding until 2015 when it was redrawn. That year Garneau was elected to represent Notre-Dame-de-Grace–Westmount. Shortly thereafter Prime Minister Justin Trudeau named Garneau minister of transport.
