M87, in full Messier 87, also called Virgo A or NGC4486,  giant elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo whose nucleus contains a black hole, the first ever to be directly imaged. M87 is the most powerful known source of radio energy among the thousands of galactic systems constituting the so-called Virgo Cluster. It is also a powerful X-ray source, which suggests the presence of very hot gas in the galaxy. A luminous gaseous jet projects outward from the galactic nucleus. Both the jet and the nucleus emit synchrotron radiation, a form of nonthermal radiation released by charged particles that are accelerated in magnetic fields and travel at speeds near that of light. M87 lies about 55 million light-years from Earth.
In 2017 the Event Horizon Telescope obtained images of the central region of M87 that showed an asymmetric ring of radio emission surrounding a dark object. The central object is the black holeâ€™s shadow, which is about five times larger than the black hole itself. The black hole is six and a half billion times the mass of the Sun and 38 billion km (24 billion miles) across. The gravitational field of the black hole is so strong that not even light can escape. The ring is brighter on one side because the black hole is rotating, and thus material on the side of the black hole turning toward Earth has its emission boosted by the Doppler effect. Gravitational energy released by gas spiraling down into the black hole produces a beam of electrons accelerated almost to the speed of light. The bright gaseous jet that emanates from M87 is thought to be radiation from this beam of electrons.
