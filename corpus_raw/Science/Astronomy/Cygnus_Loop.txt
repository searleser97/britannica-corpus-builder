Cygnus Loop,   group of bright nebulae (Lacework Nebula, Veil Nebula, and the nebulae NGC 6960, 6979, 6992, and 6995) in the constellation Cygnus, thought to be remnants of a supernovaâ€”i.e., of the explosion of a star probably 10,000 years ago. The Loop, a strong source of radio waves and X-rays, is still expanding at about 100 km (60 miles) per second. It lies about 1,800 light-years from Earth.
