AIM, in full Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere,  U.S. satellite designed to study noctilucent clouds. AIM was launched on April 25, 2007, by a Pegasus XL rocket that was dropped from an airplane. Noctilucent clouds are faint ice-bearing clouds that form at a height of about 80 km (50 miles) in the layer of the atmosphere called the mesosphere. These clouds were first seen in 1885 and have grown brighter since then. AIM carries experiments designed to study ice particles, chemicals, and interplanetary dust in the upper atmosphere in order to determine how noctilucent clouds form and why their brightness is changing. AIM found that noctilucent clouds formed around dust left by meteors burning up in the mesosphere and that the increased emission of methane from human activity leads to increased water in the mesosphere and, thus, brighter noctilucent clouds. AIM is managed by Hampton University and thus is the first satellite to be managed by a historically black university.
