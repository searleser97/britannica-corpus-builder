Achernar, also called Alpha Eridani,  brightest star in the constellation Eridanus and the ninth brightest star in the sky. Achernar (Arabic for “end of the river”) is 144 light-years from Earth. It is a binary star with a B-type star, Achernar A, as its primary and a much fainter A-type star, Achernar B, orbiting the primary at a distance of 6.7 astronomical units (1 billion km, or 621 million miles) with a period of about 15 years. Achernar A rotates at a speed of more than 250 km (150 miles) per second and thus is flattened with its equatorial diameter 40 percent larger than its polar diameter.
