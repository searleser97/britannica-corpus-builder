Apus, (Greek: “Without Feet”)  constellation in the southern sky at about 16 hours right ascension and 80° south in declination. Its brightest star is Alpha Apodis, with a magnitude of 3.8. This constellation was invented by Pieter Dircksz Keyser, a navigator who joined the first Dutch expedition to the East Indies in 1595 and who added 12 new constellations in the southern skies. Apus represents a bird-of-paradise, which at the time was believed to have no feet and thus was always airborne.
