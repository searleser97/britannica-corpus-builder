Asterism,  a pattern of stars that is not a constellation. An asterism can be part of a constellation, such as the Big Dipper, which is in the constellation Ursa Major, and can even span across constellations, such as the Summer Triangle, which is formed by the three bright stars Deneb, Altair, and Vega. Asterisms are not restricted to stars that can be seen with the naked eye; many are best observed with binoculars or a small telescope.
