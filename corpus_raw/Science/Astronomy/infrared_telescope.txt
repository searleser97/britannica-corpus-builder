Infrared telescope,  instrument designed to detect and resolve infrared radiation from sources outside Earth’s atmosphere such as nebulae, young stars, and gas and dust in other galaxies.
Infrared telescopes do not differ significantly from reflecting telescopes designed to observe in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The main difference between the two types is in the physical location of the infrared telescope, since infrared photons have lower energies than those of visible light. The infrared rays are readily absorbed by the water vapour in Earth’s atmosphere, and most of this water vapour is located at the lower atmospheric regions—i.e., near sea level. Earth-bound infrared telescopes have been successfully located on high mountaintops, as, for example, Mauna Kea in Hawaii.
An example of such an infrared telescope is the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), which has a 3.8-metre (12.5-foot) mirror made of Cer-Vit, a glass ceramic that has a very low coefficient of expansion. This instrument, located at the Mauna Kea Observatories, is configured in a Cassegrain design and employs a thin monolithic primary mirror with a lightweight support structure. The 3-metre (10-foot) Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), also located at Mauna Kea, is sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and operated by the University of Hawaii.
The other obvious placement of infrared instruments is in a satellite such as the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), which mapped the celestial sky in the infrared in 1983, or Herschel, which was launched in 2009. The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, operated by NASA and planned to begin observations in 2010, consists of a 2.5-metre (8.2-foot) telescope that is flown in a special airplane above the water vapour to collect infrared data.
