Hermann Karl Vogel,  (born April 3, 1842, Leipzig—died  Aug. 13, 1907, Potsdam, Ger.), German astronomer who discovered spectroscopic binaries—double-star systems that are too close for the individual stars to be discerned by any telescope but, through the analysis of their light, have been found to be two individual stars rapidly revolving around one another.
An assistant at the Leipzig Observatory from 1867, Vogel became director of a private observatory at Bothkamp, Ger., in 1870. His early work centred on the study of planetary spectra (the characteristic wavelengths of the light from the planets) to obtain data on the planetary atmospheres; it was published in his Spectra der Planeten (1874; “Spectra of the Planets”). In 1874 he joined the staff of the new Astrophysical Observatory at Potsdam and in 1882 became its director.
In 1887 Vogel began a program of spectroscopic measurement of the radial motions of the stars and introduced the use of photography in stellar spectroscopy. In the course of his work he proved that the star Algol is accompanied by a dark companion (about the size of the Sun) that periodically eclipses it, thus accounting for Algol’s periodic and regular variations in brightness. (This explanation of the regular variability of Algol had been conjectured a hundred years earlier by British astronomer John Goodricke.) Vogel is also noted for his work in stellar classification. First proposed in 1874 and revised in 1895, the Vogel system is based on the previous work of the Italian astronomer Pietro Angelo Secchi.
