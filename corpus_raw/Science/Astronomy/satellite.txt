Satellite,  natural object (moon) or spacecraft (artificial satellite) orbiting a larger astronomical body. Most known natural satellites orbit planets; the Earth’s Moon is the most obvious example.
All the planets in the solar system except Mercury and Venus have natural satellites. More than 160 such objects have so far been discovered, with Jupiter and Saturn together contributing about two-thirds of the total. The planets’ natural satellites vary greatly in size. Some of them measure less than 10 km (6 miles) in diameter, as in the case of some of Jupiter’s moons. A few are larger than Mercury—for example, Saturn’s Titan and Jupiter’s Ganymede, each of which is more than 5,000 km (about 3,100 miles) in diameter. The satellites also differ significantly in composition. The Moon, for example, consists almost entirely of rocky material. On the other hand, the composition of Saturn’s Enceladus is 50 percent or more ice. Some asteroids are known to have their own tiny moons.
Artificial satellites can be either unmanned (robotic) or manned. The first artificial satellite to be placed in orbit was the unmanned Sputnik 1, launched October 4, 1957, by the Soviet Union. Since then, thousands have been sent into Earth orbit. Various robotic artificial satellites have also been launched into orbit around Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, as well as around the Moon and the asteroid Eros. Spacecraft of this type are used for scientific research and for other purposes, such as communication, weather forecasting, navigation and global positioning, Earth resources management, and military intelligence. Examples of manned satellites include space stations, space shuttle orbiters circling Earth, and Apollo spacecraft in orbit around the Moon or Earth.
