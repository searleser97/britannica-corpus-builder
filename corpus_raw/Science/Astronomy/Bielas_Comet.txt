Biela’s Comet,  short-period comet named for the Austrian astronomer Wilhelm, Freiherr (baron) von Biela (1782–1856). It was originally discovered by French amateur astronomer Jacques Leibax Montaigne in 1772. It was rediscovered by French astronomer Jean-Louis Pons in 1805 and was identified as the 1772 comet by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. When it was rediscovered again by Biela in 1826, he suggested that the comet could be the same as that of 1772 and 1805 and that it had a period of about 6.75 years. (This conclusion was independently reached both by Danish astronomer Thomas Clausen and by French astronomer Jean-Félix-Adolphe Gambart. In France the comet was called Gambart’s Comet.)
Biela’s Comet underwent remarkable transformations; it was observed in 1846 to break in two, and in 1852 the fragments returned as twin comets that were never seen thereafter. In 1872 and 1885, however, when Earth crossed the path of the comet’s known orbit, bright meteor showers (known as Andromedids, or Bielids) were observed, lending strength to astronomers’ deduction that all meteor showers are composed of fragments of disintegrated comets.
