Ingress,   in astronomy, the apparent entrance of a smaller body upon the disk of a larger one as the smaller passes between the larger and the observer—e.g., the entrance of a satellite or its shadow on the disk of a planet. The term is also applied to the Moon’s entrance into the Earth’s shadow at the start of a lunar eclipse and to the Sun’s entrance into a zodiacal constellation.
