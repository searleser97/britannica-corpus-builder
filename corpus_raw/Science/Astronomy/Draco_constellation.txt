Draco, (Latin: “Dragon”)  constellation in the northern sky at about 18 hours right ascension and 70° north in declination. Its brightest star is Eltanin (from the Arabic for “dragon’s head”), with a magnitude of 2.2. Because of the precession of Earth’s axis, the star Thuban was the polestar in the third millennium bce. The identification of this constellation with a dragon dates back to the Babylonians. In Greek mythology Draco represented either the dragon that guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides or the form Zeus took to escape from his father, Cronus.
