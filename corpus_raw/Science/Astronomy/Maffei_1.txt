Maffei 1 and 2,  two galaxies relatively close to the Milky Way Galaxy but unobserved until the late 1960s, when the Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei detected them by their infrared radiation. Later studies established that the objects are galaxies. Lying near the border between the constellations Perseus and Cassiopeia, they are close to the plane of the Milky Way, where obscuring dust clouds in interstellar space prevent nearly all visible light emitted by external galaxies from reaching Earth.
Maffei 1 is a large elliptical galaxy. At about 9,800,000 light-yearsâ€™ distance, it is part of the nearest group of galaxies to the Local Group. This group is called the Maffei 1 Group, or the IC 342 Group, after the large spiral galaxy IC 342. Maffei 2 has a spiral structure and is at the same distance as Maffei 1.
