H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), also called Kounotori,  uncrewed Japanese spacecraft that carries supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). The first HTV was launched from the Tanegashima Space Centre on Tanegashima Island, Kagoshima prefecture, on September 11, 2009. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched nine HTVs periodically through 2020. An improved version of the craft, the HTV-X, is scheduled to have its first launch in 2022.
The HTV is a cylinder 9.8 metres (32 feet) long and 4.4 metres (14 feet) wide. It is divided into four parts: the Pressurized Logistics Carrier (PLC), the Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC), the Avionics Module, and the Propulsion Module. The PLC has a square hatch 1.2 metres (3.9 feet) wide, which allows the HTV to carry large scientific experiments. The ULC has an opening in its side that allows the ISS’s robotic arm to remove equipment that will be used on the outside of the ISS. The PLC and the ULC can carry 4,500 and 1,500 kg (9,900 and 3,300 pounds) of cargo, respectively. The Avionics Module holds the HTV’s electronics, and the Propulsion Module carries its thrusters.
The HTV is launched on an H-IIB launch vehicle, a variant of the H-IIA designed especially to carry the HTV. The HTV does not dock directly with the ISS but approaches to a distance of 10 metres (33 feet) and is moved to its docking position by the ISS’s robotic arm. The HTV can spend more than 60 days docked with the ISS. It is then filled with waste and burns up when it reenters Earth’s atmosphere.
