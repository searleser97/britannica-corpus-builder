Aldebaran, (Arabic: “The Follower”) also called Alpha Tauri,  reddish giant star in the constellation Taurus. Aldebaran is one of the 15 brightest stars, with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.85. Its diameter is 44 times that of the Sun. It is accompanied by a very faint (13th magnitude) red companion star. Aldebaran lies 65 light-years from Earth. The star was once thought to be a member of the Hyades cluster, but in fact Aldebaran is 85 light-years closer to Earth. Aldebaran was probably named “The Follower” because it rises after the Pleiades cluster of stars.
