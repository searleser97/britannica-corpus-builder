Alexis Bouvard,  (born June 27, 1767, Contamines, Fr.—died  June 7, 1843, Paris), astronomer and director of the Paris Observatory, who is noted for discovering eight comets and writing Tables astronomiques of Jupiter and Saturn (1808) and of Uranus (1821). Bouvard’s tables accurately predicted orbital locations of Jupiter and Saturn, but his tables for Uranus failed, leading him to hypothesize that irregularities in Uranus’ motion were caused by the influence of an unknown celestial body. In 1846, three years after Bouvard’s death, his hypothesis was confirmed by the discovery of Neptune by John Couch Adams and Urbain-Jean-Joseph Le Verrier. Bouvard was elected to the Academy of Sciences in 1803 and the Royal Society in 1826.
