Tycho’s Nova, also called B Cassiopeiae or SN 1572,  one of the few recorded supernovas in the Milky Way Galaxy. The Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe first observed the “new star” on Nov. 11, 1572. Other European observers claimed to have noticed it as early as the preceding August, but Tycho’s precise measurements showed that it was not some relatively nearby phenomenon, such as a comet, but at the distance of the stars, and that therefore real changes could occur among them.
The supernova remained visible to the unaided eye until March 1574. It attained the apparent magnitude of Venus (about −4) and could be seen by day. There is no known stellar remnant but only traces of glowing nebulosity. It is, however, a radio and X-ray source. In 2008 a team of international astronomers used light from the original explosive event reflected off nearby interstellar dust to determine that Tycho’s Nova was a Type Ia supernova, which occurs when a white dwarf star accretes material from a companion star and that material explodes in a thermonuclear reaction that destroys the white dwarf.
