LISA Pathfinder,  European Space Agency space mission that successfully tested the technology necessary for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). LISA Pathfinder was launched on December 3, 2014, by a Vega launch vehicle from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana.
LISA, scheduled to launch in 2034, will be a group of three spacecraft that are designed to search for gravity waves. The LISA spacecraft will be placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle with sides of approximately five million km (three million miles). If a gravity wave does pass through LISA, the distance between the spacecraft will change by a small amount.
LISA Pathfinder carried two instruments: the LISA Technology Package (LTP) and the Disturbance Reduction System (DRS). In the LTP two gold-platinum cubes, measuring 46 mm (1.8 inches) on a side, were suspended in evacuated chambers 37.6 cm (14.8 inches) apart. The distance between them was designed to be measured to within 1 picometre (10−12 metre) using lasers, but LISA Pathfinder was able to measure the distance between the masses to within a femtometre (10−15 metre), a thousand times better than expected. The sensitivity of LISA Pathfinder even surpassed that required for LISA itself. The DRS used small rockets to control LISA Pathfinder’s position to within 1 nanometre (10−9 metre). It is expected that use of DRS technology on LISA will allow the distance between two spacecraft to be known to within 10 picometres.
LISA Pathfinder was placed in an orbit around the first Lagrangian point (L1), a point some 1,500,00 km (900,000 miles) from Earth toward the Sun. The mission ended on June 30, 2017.
