Saturn,  in space exploration, any of a series of large two- and three-stage vehicles for launching spacecraft, developed by the United States beginning in 1958 in connection with the crewed Apollo Moon-landing program. Saturn I, the first U.S. rocket specifically developed for spaceflight, was a two-stage liquid-fuel vehicle that placed uncrewed test versions of Apollo spacecraft and other satellites into Earth orbit in the early 1960s. The first firing, on October 27, 1961, was followed by nine more successful launches. An upgraded version, the Saturn IB, was used for uncrewed and crewed Apollo Earth-orbital missions (1966–68) and subsequently for carrying crews to the first U.S. space station, Skylab (1973), and for the U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (1975).
Saturn V, a three-stage vehicle, was designed for crewed Apollo lunar flights. The first Saturn V was launched on November 9, 1967. It was employed for 10 U.S. crewed Apollo missions (Apollo 8–17, 1968–72) and a final time, uncrewed, in 1973 to orbit Skylab. In taking the three-module Apollo spacecraft and crew to the Moon, the Saturn V’s first stage, powered by five large kerosene–liquid-oxygen engines and weighing more than 2,000,000 kg (4,400,000 pounds) fully fueled, lifted itself, the second and third stages, and the spacecraft to a speed of 8,700 km (5,400 miles) per hour and to a point about 60 km (40 miles) above Earth. The first stage was then jettisoned, and the second stage, powered by five smaller liquid-hydrogen–liquid-oxygen engines and weighing more than 450,000 kg (1,000,000 pounds), took over, increasing speed to more than 22,000 km (nearly 14,000 miles) per hour. At a point about 190 km (120 miles) above Earth, the second stage was jettisoned, and the liquid-fuel single-engine third stage ignited for about 21/2 minutes to accelerate the spacecraft to 27,400 km (17,000 miles) per hour, putting it into a temporary parking orbit around Earth. The astronauts then reignited the third-stage engine, which burned for another 51/2 minutes, cutting off at an altitude of about 300 km (190 miles) and a speed of about 40,000 km (25,000 miles) per hour, the velocity needed to escape Earth’s gravity. Hours afterward the third stage was jettisoned while the spacecraft traveled on toward the Moon.
