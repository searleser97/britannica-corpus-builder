AG catalog, German in full Astronomische Gesellschaft Katalog (AGK; “Astronomical Society Catalog”),  compilation of the positions of all stars brighter than the ninth magnitude, compiled by the Astronomische Gesellschaft of Germany. Friedrich W.A. Argelander, founder of the society, proposed the star catalog in 1867, after completing the Bonner Durchmusterung (“Bonn Survey”). The massive project gave each participating observatory responsibility for mapping a specific zone of declination, and observatories around the world took part in the work.
The first version of the Astronomische Gesellschaft Katalog (AGK1) covered the sky north of 18° south declination and was completely published by 1912. A second (AGK2), based on photographs rather than direct observations, was begun in 1924 and published in 1951–58; a third catalog (AGK3) included the stars’ proper motions (the rates at which their apparent positions change) and became available in 1975.
