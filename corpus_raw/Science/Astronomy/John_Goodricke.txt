John Goodricke,  (born Sept. 17, 1764, Groningen, Neth.—died April 20, 1786, York, Yorkshire, Eng.), English astronomer who was the first to notice that some variable stars (stars whose observed light varies noticeably in intensity) were periodic. He also gave the first accurate explanation for one type of periodic variable.
Goodricke was deaf, probably because of a serious illness he had contracted in childhood. He nevertheless proved to be a bright student, and in 1778 he entered Warrington Academy, where he excelled in mathematics and his interest in astronomy was awakened. After leaving the academy in 1781 he started making his own astronomical observations. In November 1782 he was regularly observing the star known as Algol and soon realized that its brightness varies regularly over a period of a few days. By further observations he confirmed these periodic variations and accurately estimated the period at a bit less than 2 days and 21 hours. Variations in brightness of Algol, Mira, and other stars had been noted by earlier astronomers, but Goodricke was the first to establish that some variables are truly periodic in nature. Goodricke reported his findings to the Royal Society, and the society awarded him a Copley Medal in 1783.
In the remainder of his short life Goodricke discovered the variability of two other stars that are visible with the naked eye. More importantly, he suggested that the variability of Algol was due to its being periodically eclipsed by a darker companion body; this theory was eventually confirmed for Algol, which belongs to the class of stars known as eclipsing variables. Goodricke died at age 21, as a consequence, his contemporaries believed, of his exposure to cold night air while making his observations. Goodricke worked in collaboration and competition with Edward Pigott, another amateur astronomer, who discovered his own variable stars and who carried on the work after Goodricke’s death.
