Cepheus,  constellation in the northern sky, at about 23 hours right ascension and 70° north in declination. It is shaped like a box with a triangle on top. The brightest star, Alderamin (from the Arabic for “right arm”), has a magnitude of 2.5. The star Delta Cephei gave its name to the variable stars called Cepheid variables. Cepheid variables have a close relationship between their period of variability and their luminosity and thus have been very useful in the measurement of astronomical distances. Cepheus is named after the king of Ethiopia who, according to Greek mythology, was forced to sacrifice his daughter Andromeda to the sea monster Cetus.
