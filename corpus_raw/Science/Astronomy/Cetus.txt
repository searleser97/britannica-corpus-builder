Cetus, (Latin: “Whale”)  constellation in the southern sky, at about 2 hours right ascension and 10° south in declination. The brightest star, Deneb Kaitos (from the Arabic for “tail of the whale”), has a visual magnitude of 2.04. The most famous star in Cetus is Mira Ceti, or Omicron Ceti, the first known variable star. Mira Ceti changes its brightness from third to ninth magnitude over a period of 330 days. In Greek mythology, Cetus was the sea monster that was sent by Poseidon to devour Andromeda, daughter of King Cepheus of Ethiopia. In some accounts, the Greek hero Perseus used the Medusa’s head to turn Cetus to stone; in others, Perseus killed Cetus with his sword.
