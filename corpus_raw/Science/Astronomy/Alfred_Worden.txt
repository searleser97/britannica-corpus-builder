Al Worden, in full Alfred Merrill Worden,  (born February 7, 1932, Jackson, Michigan, U.S.—died March 18, 2020, Houston, Texas), U.S. astronaut, pilot of the command module Endeavour on the Apollo 15 mission (July 26–August 7, 1971).
Worden graduated in 1955 from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, and he earned M.S. degrees in astronautical and aeronautical engineering and in instrumentation engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1963. He was a U.S. Air Force pilot and a commercial test pilot before joining the space program in 1966.
During the Apollo 15 mission, he orbited the Moon while commander David Scott and lunar module pilot James Irwin descended to the Moon’s surface. On the return trip, Worden took a space walk—at what was then the record distance from Earth for such activity, about 315,000 km (196,000 miles)—retrieving cassettes containing films of the Moon from the rear of a subsatellite that they had sent into orbit two days previously.
After serving at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California, from 1972 to 1975, Worden resigned from the Air Force and the space program to enter private enterprises in Colorado and Florida. He wrote a book of poetry, Hello Earth—Greetings from Endeavour (1974), and a children’s book, I Want to Know About a Flight to the Moon (1974). Falling to Earth: An Apollo 15 Astronaut’s Journey (2011; written with Francis French) is a memoir.
