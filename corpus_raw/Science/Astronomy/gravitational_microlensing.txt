Gravitational microlensing,  brightening of a star by an object passing between the star and an observer. Since 2004 many extrasolar planets have been found through gravitational microlensing, including several so-called free-floating planets that do not orbit any star. This technique depends on an effect first discussed by physicist Albert Einstein. In his 1916 paper on general relativity, he showed how light that passed a massive object would be deflected by the objectâ€™s gravity. In this way, an extrasolar planet can act as a gravitational lens that would focus the light from a more distant star.
