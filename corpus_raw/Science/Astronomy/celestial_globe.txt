Celestial globe,  representation of stars and constellations as they are located on the apparent sphere of the sky. Celestial globes are used for some astronomical or astrological calculations or as ornaments.
Some globes were made in ancient Greece; Thales of Miletus (fl. 6th century bce) is generally credited with having constructed the first. Probably the oldest in existence is the Farnese Globe, estimated as from the 3rd century bce, now in the National Archaeological Museum at Naples. It shows constellation figures but not individual stars and would have been of little practical astronomical use; it is thought to be a Roman copy of a Greek globe. Some Arabic globes made as early as the 11th century ce are extant. Among the seafaring peoples of the Pacific islands, globes were used to teach celestial navigation.
