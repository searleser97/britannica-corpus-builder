Cosmological constant,  term reluctantly added by Albert Einstein to his equations of general relativity in order to obtain a solution to the equations that described a static universe, as he believed it to be at the time. The constant has the effect of a repulsive force that acts against the gravitational attraction of matter in the universe. When Einstein heard of the evidence that the universe is expanding, he called the introduction of the cosmological constant the “biggest blunder” of his life. However, recent observations have detected a repulsive force, somewhat similar to the cosmological constant, that is dubbed dark energy and is the dominant component of the universe.
