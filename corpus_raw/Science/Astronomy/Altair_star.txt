Altair, also called Alpha Aquilae,  the brighest star in the northern constellation Aquila and the 12th brightest star in the sky. With the bright stars Deneb and Vega, Altair (Arabic for “flying eagle”) forms the prominent asterism of the Summer Triangle. It is an A-type star 16.6 light-years from Earth. Altair rotates at the fast speed of more than 200 km (120 miles) per second. Because of its fast rotation, it has a flattened shape, with its equatorial diameter about 20 percent larger than its polar diameter. Images taken in 2006 of Altair’s surface show that the fast rotation also causes the equator to be darker, and therefore cooler, than the poles.
