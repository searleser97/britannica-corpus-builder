Camelopardalis, (Latin: “Giraffe”)  constellation in the northern sky at about 6 hours right ascension and 70° north in declination. Its brightest star is Beta Camelopardalis, with a magnitude of 4.0. Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius introduced this constellation on a celestial globe he made in 1612 and represented it as a giraffe. Because this area of the sky contains only faint stars, it had not been ascribed to a constellation earlier.
