Karl Ludwig Hencke,  (born April 8, 1793, Driesen, Brandenburg [now Drezdenko, Pol.]â€”died  Sept. 21, 1866, Marienwerder, Prussia [now Kwidzyn, Pol.]), amateur astronomer who found the fifth and sixth minor planets to be discovered. Professional astronomers had largely given up the search for asteroids in 1816, when four were known. Hencke, a post office employee in Driesen who eventually became postmaster, began his systematic search in 1830 and found Astraea (minor planet 5) on Dec. 8, 1845, and Hebe (minor planet 6) on July 1, 1847.
