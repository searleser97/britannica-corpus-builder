Centaur object,  any of a population of small bodies, similar to asteroids in size but to comets in composition, that revolve around the Sun in the outer solar system, mainly between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune. The first known member of the group, Chiron, was discovered in 1977, although its close affinity with icy comet nuclei was not recognized until more than a decade later. Since the discovery of the second known representative, Pholus, in 1992, hundreds of Centaur objects, or Centaurs, have been reported, and astronomers have speculated that thousands more may exist.
Centaur objects, which are as large as about 250 km (160 miles) in diameter, are thought to have originated beyond the orbits of Neptune and Pluto, in a vast, disk-shaped reservoir of comet nuclei called the Kuiper belt. Having been perturbed inward by Neptune’s gravitational influence, they presently travel in unstable orbits that cross the paths of the giant planets. Because of the likelihood that they will collide with a planet or be flung by a planet’s gravity out of the solar system or toward the inner planets, these objects are thought to spend a short lifetime, in astronomical terms, as Centaurs. This implies that the population of Centaurs is being continually replenished from the Kuiper belt.
At the large distances of the Centaurs from the Sun, customary distinctions between comets and asteroids can become blurred. By traditional definition, comets contain more frozen water and other volatile compounds than rocky material, and they give off gases when these ices vaporize. At the very low temperatures in the outer solar system, however, icy bodies such as the Centaurs may never show this activity.
