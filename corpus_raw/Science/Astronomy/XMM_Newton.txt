XMM-Newton,  European Space Agency (ESA) satellite that observes celestial X-ray sources. It was launched in 1999 and was named after English physicist Isaac Newton.
XMM-Newton is one of the largest European science satellites. It is 10 metres (33 feet) long, its solar arrays span 16 metres (52 feet), and it weighs 3.8 metric tons. It was launched on December 10, 1999, from Kourou, French Guiana, by an Ariane 5 launch vehicle. The satellite orbits Earth every 48 hours and is in an eccentric orbit (perigee of 7,000 km [4,000 miles] and apogee of 114,000 km [71,000 miles]) that allows long observations of astronomical objects.
XMM-Newton carries three X-ray telescopes. Each of these telescopes contains 58 nested gold-plated nickel mirrors (XMM stands for X-ray Multi-Mirror) that focus the highly energetic X-rays through the technique of grazing incidence, in which X-rays are reflected when they strike the mirrors at a very small angle. XMM-Newton has the largest light-collecting area of any X-ray telescope—more than 120 square metres (1,300 square feet). The mirrors focus the X-rays to one of three cameras or one of two spectrometers. XMM-Newton can observe X-rays in the energy range of 0.1 to 12 keV (kiloelectron volts).
XMM-Newton studies objects such as black holes, quasars, and neutron stars. It discovered a new class of black holes that had masses several hundred times that of the Sun. It determined that neutron stars are most likely composed of ordinary matter and not some exotic form, such as strange quarks and kaons. XMM-Newton also discovered a galaxy cluster that was extremely massive (about 1,000 times more massive than the Milky Way Galaxy) and extremely distant (about 7.7 billion light-years away); the evolution of such a cluster reveals how the universe itself has evolved. XMM-Newton’s mission is scheduled to last until 2020.
