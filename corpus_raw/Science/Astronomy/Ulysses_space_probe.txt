Ulysses,  joint European-U.S. space probe launched in 1990 that was the first spacecraft to fly over the poles of the Sun and return data on the solar wind, the Sun’s magnetic field, and other activity in the Sun’s atmosphere at high solar latitudes. Understanding such solar activity is important not only because the Sun is an average star that is available for close scrutiny but also because its activity has important consequences for Earth and its inhabitants as dependence increases on space-based systems that can be affected by what has come to be called "space weather," which is largely driven by solar phenomena.
The Ulysses spacecraft was launched on Oct. 6, 1990, on the space shuttle. It flew by Jupiter in February 1992, and that planet’s strong gravity field was used to send the spacecraft out of the ecliptic of the solar system so that it could enter a polar orbit around the Sun. Ulysses flew past the south pole of the Sun on Sept. 13, 1994, and over the Sun’s north pole in 1995, at a time of minimum solar activity. It flew over the poles once again in 2000–01, this time during maximum solar activity, and again in 2006–08, during another solar minimum but with the polarity of the Sun’s magnetic field reversed from that of the previous minimum. After a year of operating with a much-weakened power supply, Ulysses’ mission ended on June 30, 2009.
Among Ulysses’ discoveries was that the solar wind speed did not increase continuously toward the poles but rather at high latitudes leveled off at 750 km (450 miles) per second. The elemental composition of the solar wind was found to differ between fast and slow solar wind streams. In the polar regions the cosmic-ray flux was not enhanced as much as was expected, because the Sun’s magnetic waves, themselves discovered by Ulysses, scattered the cosmic rays.
