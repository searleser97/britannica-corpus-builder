Kwangmyŏngsŏng, (Korean: “Bright Star”)  any of a North Korean series of satellites. The first successful satellite, Kwangmyŏngsŏng 3, entered orbit on December 12, 2012. It was launched from Sŏhae in North P’yŏngan province by an Unha-3 (Korean: “Galaxy-3”) launch vehicle, which was a version of the Unha-2 rocket that used a third stage based on that of the Iranian Safīr rocket. This Earth-observing satellite traveled in a polar orbit at an altitude between 505.6 and 588.8 km (314.2 and 365.9 miles), circling the planet every 96 minutes.
The launch of Kwangmyŏngsŏng 3 caused an international outcry because it was North Korea’s first successful test of long-range missile technology and represented a step toward possible development of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Two previous launches, in August 1998 and April 2009, had failed to achieve orbit, but, to international observers, those were intended not as actual satellite launches but as missile tests. (North Korea claimed that those launches had placed satellites in orbit, but no such satellites were ever observed.) For a launch in April 2012, North Korea took the unusual step of inviting foreign media to Sŏhae to see the satellite (the first version of Kwangmyŏngsŏng 3) and the Unha-3, but no reporters were present at the actual launch, which ended with the failure of the first stage.
