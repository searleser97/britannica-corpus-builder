Halton Christian Arp,  (born March 21, 1927, New York, New York, U.S.—died December 28, 2013, Munich, Germany), American astronomer noted for challenging the theory that redshifts of quasars indicate their great distance.
Arp received a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University in 1949 and a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1953. He subsequently accepted a research fellowship to conduct postdoctoral studies at the nearby Hale Observatories (now Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories). After he worked as a research associate at Indiana University from 1955 to 1957, Arp returned to Mount Wilson, securing a post as an assistant astronomer on the observatory staff. He was appointed astronomer there in 1965.
Arp became skeptical about the distance of quasars when he noticed that some of the galaxies that he had included in his Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies (1966) seemed to lie in the vicinity of quasars. Using photographic evidence, Arp tried to prove that the low-redshift galaxies and the high-redshift quasars not only appear close together but also actually are connected by gaseous bridges, an impossibility if the quasars are billions of light-years farther away than the galaxies. Arp theorized that the nuclei of galaxies may explode, ejecting quasars with a velocity great enough to account for their redshifts. The dispute over the distances of the quasars was known as the “redshift controversy.” The controversy faded away in the late 1970s and early 1980s when Arp’s theory could not account for quasars and nearby galaxies that were at the same redshift, the gravitational lensing of quasars by high-redshift galaxies, or the existence of high-redshift intergalactic gas that absorbs the light of quasars at even higher redshifts. In 1984 Arp became a senior research scientist at the Max Planck Institute in Garching, Germany.
