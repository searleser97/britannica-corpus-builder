André-Louis Danjon,  (born April 6, 1890, Caen, France—died  April 21, 1967, Paris), French astronomer noted for his important developments in astronomical instruments and for his studies of the Earth’s rotation.
Danjon served in the French army (1914–19) and then became an astronomer at the University Observatory at Strasbourg. In 1930 he became its director, and the following year he was appointed professor of astronomy at the University of Strasbourg. In 1945 Danjon became director of the Paris Observatory and in 1946 attained the post of professor of astronomy at the Sorbonne. He became director of the Institute of Astrophysics of Paris in 1954.
While studying the methods of positional astronomy, Danjon concluded that the transit had reached its ultimate in precision and began looking for a fundamentally new instrument. The result of his work was the prismatic 60° astrolabe, now known as the Danjon astrolabe. Within four years of its introduction (1956), the Danjon astrolabe was being used in more than 30 major observatories.
Danjon developed other precise instruments for positional and magnitude determinations and used them to investigate the irregularities in the rotational period of the Earth. In 1958 he concluded that certain sudden increases in the Earth’s rotational period coincided with exceptionally intense solar activity.
He served as president of the International Astronomical Union (1955–58) and retired from academic life in 1963.
