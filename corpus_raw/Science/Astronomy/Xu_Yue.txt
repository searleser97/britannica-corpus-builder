Xu Yue, Wade-Giles Hsü Yüeh,  (born c. 185, Donglai [modern Shandong province], China—died c. 227, China), Chinese astronomer and mathematician.
Xu was a disciple of Liu Hong (c. 129–210), an influential government astronomer and mathematician. Apparently, Xu never held any official government position, yet his expertise was highly esteemed by official astronomers who invited his participation in the debates (220–227) concerning the accuracy and merits of Liu’s new calendar (the Qianxiang calendar).
Xu wrote several books, of which only Shushu jiyi (“Memoir on the Methods of Numbering”), with a preface by Zhen Luan (flourished c. 560), is extant; some scholars question its authenticity, claiming that it was a forgery written in its entirety by Zhen. The treatise was used as an auxiliary mathematics textbook in the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) state universities. Its first part provides three methods of assigning the powers of 10 up to 104,096 to traditionally established terms for “large numbers” and allusively mentions a method of indefinite generation of even larger numbers, which has led to comparisons with Archimedes’ The Sand-Reckoner (3rd century bc). The second part contains descriptions of various devices for representing, if not actually manipulating, large numbers—among them a device resembling the abacus, which some scholars believe originated in China.
