Jack Swigert, in full John Leonard Swigert, Jr.,  (born August 30, 1931, Denver, Colorado, U.S.—died December 27, 1982, Washington, D.C.), U.S. astronaut, command module pilot on the Apollo 13 mission (April 11–17, 1970), in which an intended Moon landing was canceled because of a ruptured fuel-cell oxygen tank in the service module. The crew, consisting of Swigert, lunar module pilot Fred W. Haise, Jr., and commander James A. Lovell, Jr., returned safely to Earth, making use of the life-support system in the lunar module. Swigert was originally a backup for Apollo 13, but three days before launch he replaced Thomas K. Mattingly, who had been exposed to measles (though he never became ill).
Swigert graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder, in 1953 and was awarded a master’s degree by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, in 1965. Before becoming an astronaut in 1966, he was a U.S. Air Force pilot in Japan and Korea and a commercial test pilot.
Swigert took a leave of absence from the space program in 1973 to become executive director of the Committee on Science and Technology of the U.S. House of Representatives. He resigned from the committee and from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1977 and entered private business in Virginia. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1978 but was elected from Colorado to the House of Representatives in 1982. He died of cancer before taking office.
