Mars Polar Lander,  unsuccessful U.S. space probe that was designed to study the polar regions of Mars and whose loss in late 1999 badly stung the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), forcing the agency to reassess its Mars exploration strategy.
The Mars Polar Lander was launched on Jan. 3, 1999, from Cape Canaveral, Fla. In addition to the main probe, which was to land near the Martian south pole, the mission also carried the Deep Space 2 microprobes, which were to be dropped from the spacecraft during landing and penetrate about 60 cm (2 feet) into the ground. The Mars Polar Lander was to land on Dec. 3, 1999, but contact was lost during atmospheric entry and was never reestablished. In March 2000 investigators reported that, because of a software fault, the onboard computer probably interpreted the jolt from the extension of the landing legs as the landing signal itself and shut off the engines prematurely, when the craft was still more than 40 metres (132 feet) above the surface. The probe then would have crashed to the surface. Following this debacle, NASA restructured its unmanned Mars exploration program and decided to fly simpler missions based on the air-bag lander and rover technology from the highly successful Mars Pathfinder and Sojourner mission of 1997. The exploration of the polar regions of Mars was finally accomplished in 2008 by the Phoenix lander.
