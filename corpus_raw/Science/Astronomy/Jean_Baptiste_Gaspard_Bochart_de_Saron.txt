Jean-Baptiste-Gaspard Bochart de Saron,  (born Jan. 16, 1730, Paris, France—died  April 20, 1794, Paris), French lawyer and natural scientist who became especially known for his contributions to astronomy.
After studies at the Collège Louis-le-Grand, a part of the University of Paris, Saron became legal counselor to the Parlement of Paris in 1748, master of requests in 1750, advocate general in 1753, a judicial president in 1755, and president of the Parlement of Paris in 1789 a few months prior to the outbreak of the French Revolution.
Well-to-do, he became a patron of the sciences, financing the publication of the marquis de Laplace’s Theory of the Movement and Elliptic Figure of the Planets (1784) and developing one of Europe’s largest and finest collections of reflecting telescopes and other astronomical instruments for his own use and the use of his scientific friends. Saron’s own studies included calculation of the orbits of comets, using data contributed by his long-time collaborator Charles Messier. In 1779 Saron was received into the Academy of Sciences as an honorary member.
Saron was one of several astronomers who tried to fit orbits to British astronomer William Herschel’s new “comet” of 1781. He was the first to argue that the object must be at a great distance and tried to fit it with a circular orbit with a radius equal to 12 times the distance from Earth to the Sun. This was a step in the right direction and helped establish the “comet” Uranus as a planet.
Saron protested the dissolution of the Parlement and was guillotined during the Reign of Terror.
