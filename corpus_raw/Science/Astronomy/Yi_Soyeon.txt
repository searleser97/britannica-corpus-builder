Yi Soyeon,  (born June 2, 1978, Kwangju, South Korea), South Korean scientist and astronaut, the first South Korean citizen in space.
Yi earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Taejŏn in 2001 and 2002, respectively. In 2006 she was working toward a doctorate in biological science at KAIST when she was one of two finalists selected from 36,000 applicants to train in Russia for a flight to the International Space Station (ISS). South Korea paid Russia $20 million to allow a South Korean cosmonaut to accompany the Russian spaceflight. Yi was trained as a backup to computer engineer Ko San. The Russian Federal Space Agency, however, barred Ko from the mission for violations of training protocol after he removed reading materials from a training centre and mailed classified documents to South Korea.
On April 8, 2008, Yi blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan as a payload specialist alongside two Russian cosmonauts, commander Sergey Volkov and flight engineer Oleg Kononenko. Their Soyuz TMA-12 craft docked with the ISS, where Yi spent nine days carrying out experiments and medical tests. She returned on April 19 with two returning space station crew members, American commander Peggy Whitson and Russian flight engineer Yury Malenchenko, aboard Soyuz TMA-11. Although the mission was a success, the Soyuz’s equipment module failed to separate properly from the reentry module, and so the craft followed an unusually steep trajectory to Earth and made a rough landing in the Kazakhstan steppes, during which Yi sustained back injuries that later required her hospitalization. She resigned from South Korea’s space program in 2014.
