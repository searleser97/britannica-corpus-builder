 A galaxy is any of the systems of stars and interstellar matter that make up the universe. Many such assemblages are so enormous that they contain hundreds of billions of stars. Galaxy clusters are gravitationally bound groupings of galaxies, numbering from the hundreds to the tens of thousands. This is an alphabetically ordered list of selected galaxies and galaxy clusters. (See also astronomy; cosmology; list of stars; nebula; protogalaxy; star cluster; supercluster.)
