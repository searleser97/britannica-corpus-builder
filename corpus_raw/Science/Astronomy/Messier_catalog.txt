Messier catalog,  (M), in astronomy, list of 110 star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies compiled by Charles Messier, who discovered many of them. The catalog is still a valuable guide to amateur astronomers, although it has been superceded by the New General Catalogue (NGC); both NGC numbers and Messier numbers remain in common use. The Messier catalog includes such diverse objects as the Crab Nebula supernova remnant (M1), the Pleiades star cluster (M45), and the great spiral galaxy in Andromeda (M31). Messier’s purpose was to make comet hunting easier by tabulating permanent deep-sky objects that could be mistaken for comets. He published a preliminary list of 45 such objects in 1771 and compiled the bulk of his catalog 10 years later. By 1784 he had listed 103 objects; in 1783 his friend and collaborator Pierre Méchain added six more. In 1966 British amateur astronomer Kenneth Glyn Jones added a satellite galaxy of M31 that Messier had discovered but not included in his catalog.
