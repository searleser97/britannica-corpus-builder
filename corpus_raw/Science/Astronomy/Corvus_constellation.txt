Corvus, (Latin: “Raven”)  constellation in the southern sky at about 12 hours right ascension and 20° south in declination. The brightest star in Corvus is Gienah (from the Arabic for “right wing of the raven”), with a magnitude of 2.59. In Greek mythology this constellation is associated with Crater (Latin: “Cup”) and Hydra (Latin: “Water Snake”). The god Apollo sent the crow to fetch water in a cup for a sacrifice. The crow landed near a fig tree and neglected its mission for several days while it waited for the figs to ripen. The crow returned to Apollo with a water snake, which it blamed for blocking the spring. Angered by the crow’s failure, Apollo cast the crow, the cup, and the water snake into the sky.
