Odin,  Swedish-French-Canadian-Finnish satellite that carried a 1.1-metre (43-inch) radio telescope as its main instrument. On Feb. 20, 2001, Odin was launched from Svobodny, Russia. It is named after the ruler of the Norse gods. Using two separate operating modes, the dual-mission craft was designed to study ozone-depletion mechanisms in Earth’s atmosphere and to observe radiation from a variety of molecular species to elucidate star formation processes in deep space. Odin typically switches from astronomical to atmospheric observations every third day, when it turns to scan Earth’s atmosphere. Odin achieved one of its primary goals when it discovered molecular oxygen in a star-forming cloud.
