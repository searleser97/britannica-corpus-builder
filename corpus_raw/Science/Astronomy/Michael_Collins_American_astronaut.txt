Michael Collins,  (born October 31, 1930, Rome, Italy—died April 28, 2021, Naples, Florida, U.S.), U.S. astronaut who was the command module pilot of Apollo 11, the first crewed lunar landing mission.
A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, Collins transferred to the air force, becoming a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in California. He joined the space program in 1963.
Gemini 10, crewed by Collins and command pilot John W. Young, was launched on July 18, 1966. After a rendezvous with an Agena target vehicle, the two men used the Agena’s engines to propel them to a record altitude of 764 km (475 miles), where Collins left the spacecraft to remove equipment needed for a micrometeorite experiment from the aft end of the Gemini and attempted unsuccessfully to attach similar equipment to the Agena. He succeeded in retrieving an instrument from the Agena, but his activity was cut short because the Gemini craft was low on fuel. Gemini 10 returned to Earth on July 21.
On July 16, 1969, Collins was launched to the Moon in the Apollo 11 mission with commander Neil A. Armstrong and lunar module pilot Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the Moon in the lunar module Eagle on July 20 while Collins remained in the command module Columbia, circling the Moon at an altitude of 97–121 km (60–75 miles). On July 21 Armstrong and Aldrin rejoined him, and the following day the astronauts left lunar orbit. They splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. The three astronauts spent 18 days in quarantine to guard against possible contamination by lunar microbes. During the days that followed and during a tour of 21 nations, they were hailed for their part in the opening of a new era in humankind’s exploration of the universe.
Apollo 11 was his last space mission; later in 1969 Collins was appointed assistant secretary of state for public affairs. In 1971 he became the first director of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., and in 1978 he became undersecretary of the Smithsonian Institution. From 1980 to 1985 he was vice president for field operations for Vought Corporation, an American aerospace firm. He wrote four books, including an account of the Apollo 11 mission, Carrying the Fire (1974), and a history of the American space program, Liftoff (1988).
