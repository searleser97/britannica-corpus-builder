Gravity Probe B (GP-B),  U.S. spacecraft, launched April 20, 2004, into polar orbit, that tested Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Specifically, it proved the existence of both frame-dragging—a very subtle phenomenon in which the rotation of a body (in this case, Earth) slowly drags the space-time continuum with it—and the geodetic effect, in which Earth’s curvature of space-time causes the circumference of an orbit to be smaller than it would be if space-time were flat. The measured values for these effects agreed with those predicted by general relativity. The craft carried four gyroscopes of ultraprecision 4-cm (1.6-inch) polished quartz spheres spinning in liquid helium. The mission of GP-B ended on Sept. 25, 2005, when the last of its liquid helium coolant ran out, and final results were announced in 2011.
