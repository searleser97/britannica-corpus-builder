Gordon Cooper, in full Leroy Gordon Cooper, Jr., also called L. Gordon Cooper, Jr.,  (born March 6, 1927, Shawnee, Oklahoma, U.S.—died October 4, 2004, Ventura, California),   one of the original team of seven U.S. astronauts. On May 15–16, 1963, he circled Earth 22 times in the space capsule Faith 7, completing the sixth and last of the Mercury crewed spaceflights. At the end of his 34-hour 20-minute flight, when the automatic control system had broken down, he piloted his craft back to Earth manually and landed just 4 miles (6 km) from the primary recovery ship. In August 1965 he served as command pilot of Gemini 5 on an eight-day endurance mission, becoming the first person to make two orbital flights.
After brief service with the Marine Corps, Cooper earned a commission with the U.S. Army at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu (1946–49) and transferred to the air force. He received a B.S. in aeronautics (1956) from the Air Force Institute of Technology, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, and served as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base, California, until 1959, when he was selected as a Mercury astronaut. After serving as the backup pilot for Sigma 7’s 1962 mission, Cooper took his first spaceflight in May 1963. It was the longest of the Mercury flights, and with it Cooper became the last U.S. astronaut to fly alone. In 1965 Cooper flew with Charles Conrad, Jr., on Gemini 5. Although the mission was plagued by mechanical problems, they were able to set an endurance record of nearly 191 hours.
Cooper resigned from the air force and the space program in 1970 and entered private business. His autobiography, Leap of Faith: An Astronaut’s Journey into the Unknown, was published in 2000.
