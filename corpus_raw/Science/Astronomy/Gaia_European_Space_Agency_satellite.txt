Gaia,  European Space Agency (ESA) satellite that provided highly accurate position and velocity measurements for more than one billion stars. It was launched on December 19, 2013, by a Soyuz rocket from Kourou, French Guiana.
Gaia carries two telescopes, each with an aperture of 1.45 by 0.5 metres (4.76 by 1.6 feet), with an angle of 106.5° between their lines of sight. Gaia slowly rotates, allowing it to scan the entire sky. Positions for the brightest stars were measured to an accuracy of 0.000007 arc second, about 140 times more accurate than the positions measured by the previous ESA satellite Hipparcos. Gaia also carries a photometer to measure the brightness of astronomical objects and a spectrometer to measure the velocities of those objects. Gaia was positioned near the second Lagrangian point (L2), a gravitational balance point between Earth and the Sun and 1.5 million km (0.9 million miles) opposite the Sun from Earth. The spacecraft moves in a controlled Lissajous pattern around L2 rather than “hovering” there. Its mission was scheduled to last to the end of 2022.
By providing accurate positions, velocities, and brightnesses for more than one billion stars, Gaia had an effect on many areas of astronomy. It made an accurate three-dimensional map of much of the Milky Way Galaxy. It is expected to observe more than 18 million variable stars and discover thousands of supernovas and asteroids. Gaia could also detect many new extrasolar planets.
