Space elevator,  a concept for lifting mass out of Earth’s gravity well without using rockets in which an extremely strong cable extends from Earth’s surface to the height of geostationary orbit (35,786 km [22,236 miles]) or beyond. The competing forces of gravity at the lower end and outward centripetal acceleration at the farther end would keep the cable under tension and stationary over a single position on Earth. It would then be possible to attach a payload to this cable on Earth and lift it by mechanical means to an orbital height. When released at that point, it would have the velocity to remain in orbit or to use an additional in-space propulsion system to send it to deep-space destinations. This concept was originally advanced by Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1895; far-fetched as it may seem, it has been the subject of serious preliminary research.
