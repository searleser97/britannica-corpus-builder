Jacques Cassini,  (born Feb. 18, 1677, Paris, France—died April 15/16, 1756, Thury), French astronomer who compiled the first tables of the orbital motions of Saturn’s satellites.
He succeeded his father, the astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini, as head of the Paris Observatory in 1712, and in 1718 he completed the measurement of the arc of the meridian (longitude line) between Dunkerque and Perpignan. In his De la grandeur et de la figure de la terre (1720; “Concerning the Size and Shape of the Earth”), he supported the theory that the Earth is an elongated sphere, rather than flattened.
Cassini’s astronomical studies are found principally in Éléments d’astronomie (1740; “Elements of Astronomy”) and Tables astronomiques du soleil, de la lune, des planètes, des étoiles fixes et des satellites de Jupiter et de Saturne (1740; “Astronomical Tables of the Sun, Moon, Planets, Fixed Stars, and Satellites of Jupiter and Saturn”). An ardent opponent of Sir Isaac Newton’s gravitational theory, he continually defended his father’s work; but he was unable to reconcile his observations with his father’s theories.
