Lewis Morris Rutherfurd,  (born Nov. 25, 1816, Morrisania, N.Y., U.S.—died  May 30, 1892, Tranquility, N.J.), American astrophysicist who made the first telescopes designed for celestial photography.
Although trained as a scientist during his studies at Williams College (Williamstown, Mass.), Rutherfurd later became a lawyer. He gave up his practice in 1849 and traveled to Europe because of his wife’s health. He had maintained an interest in science and in Europe met the Italian astronomer Giovanni Amici, who was working on achromatism in microscopes. In 1856 he set up a small observatory at his home in New York City and obtained his first photographs of the Moon two years later. Not satisfied with taking pictures through a regular telescope, he devised a lens system that converted it into a photographic telescope (essentially a camera using a telescope as a lens). He successfully tested his invention in 1860, photographing a solar eclipse from Labrador.
Rutherfurd’s interest turned to spectroscopy, and in 1863 he published the first attempt to classify stellar spectra. His classification agrees in essence with the one later published by Angelo Secchi of Italy.
Rutherfurd began systematically photographing the heavens and devised a machine for measuring stellar positions on photographic plates. Convinced that the value of a photographic record of stellar positions depended on stable negatives, he found a method of treating film to increase its stability. He also constructed a machine to rule diffraction gratings (devices for breaking light down to its component colours) with up to 6,700 lines per cm (17,000 lines per inch).
A trustee of Columbia College (later Columbia University), Rutherfurd helped establish the department of geodesy and practical astronomy (1881) and gave the college all his equipment and records of his investigations (1883).
