Diurnal motion,   apparent daily motion of the heavens from east to west in which celestial objects seem to rise and set, a phenomenon that results from the Earth’s rotation from west to east. The axis of this apparent motion coincides with the Earth’s axis of rotation. The intersection of the plane of the Earth’s Equator with the celestial sphere defines the celestial equator. The apparent daily paths of celestial objects are circles parallel to the celestial equator and are termed diurnal circles.
