Heracleides Ponticus,  (born c. 390 bce, Heraclea Pontica, Bithyniaâ€”died  after 322, Athens), Greek philosopher and astronomer who first suggested the rotation of Earth, an idea that did not dominate astronomy until 1,800 years later. He was a pupil of Plato, who left the Academy temporarily in his charge. Heracleides was once thought to have correctly attributed the apparent motion of Mercury and Venus to their revolving around the Sun; however, this was a misapprehension of his discussion of Venus appearing either in the morning or evening sky. He also taught some kind of atomism. His writings, all lost except for a few fragments, include literary criticism and works on musicology. He also studied trances, cosmological visions, prophecies, portents, and cataclysms, attempting to prove the existence of gods, divine retribution, and reincarnation. He thus exemplified the supranaturalistic tendencies of Platonism and anticipated some aspects of Neoplatonism.
