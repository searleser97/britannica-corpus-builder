After completing cosmonaut training, Tamayo Méndez traveled into space aboard Soyuz 38 with Soviet cosmonaut Yury Romanenko on Sept. 18, 1980. During the eight-day mission, Soyuz 38 docked with the Salyut 6 space station, and Tamayo Méndez and Romanenko conducted several scientific experiments and research studies. Upon his return Tamayo Méndez was awarded the first title of Hero of the Republic of Cuba by Fidel Castro and was also bestowed with the Order of Lenin and the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the highest decoration in the Soviet Union.
After his spaceflight Tamayo Méndez returned to the Cuban air force. In 1982 he was appointed chairman of the Military-Patriotic Educational Society (SEPMI), a military instruction program for Cuban youth. He remained SEPMI’s chairman until 1992. Tamayo Méndez eventually rose to the rank of brigadier general in the air force and served as the director of the Department of International Affairs for the Cuban armed forces and as the director of Cuba’s civil defense organization.
