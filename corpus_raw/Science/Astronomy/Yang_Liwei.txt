Yang Liwei,  (born June 21, 1965, Suizhong, Liaoning, China), Chinese astronaut and the first person sent into space by the Chinese space program.
In 1983 he enlisted in the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), where he was chosen to enter the aviation college of the PLA Air Force. He graduated in 1987 and became a fighter pilot, accumulating more than 1,350 flight hours. In 1998 he was selected from more than 1,500 candidates to enter astronaut training for China’s crewed spaceflight program. With 11 other taikonauts (the Chinese equivalent of astronauts), Yang spent five years studying the science and operation of spacecraft and undergoing physical and psychological training.
Yang was identified as the crew member for China’s first crewed spaceflight only one day before the scheduled launch of the Shenzhou 5 craft. On October 15, 2003, he lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in the Gobi desert in China’s Gansu province. A Chang Zheng 2F rocket boosted Shenzhou 5 into space, where Yang spent 21 hours and orbited Earth 14 times. He never entered the craft’s orbital module, which was released to perform a six-month military imaging reconnaissance mission. On October 16 he returned aboard the reentry module, which parachuted to the ground near a landing site in Inner Mongolia.
Following Yang’s return, he was named vice-commander-in-chief of the astronauts system of China’s crewed spaceflight project. In 2008 Yang was promoted to major general.
