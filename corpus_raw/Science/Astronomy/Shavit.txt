Shavit,  Israeli launch vehicle. Shavit (Hebrew for “comet”) is a small three-stage solid-fueled rocket, first launched in 1988. It was based on the Jericho 2 ballistic missile. Because of its geographic location and hostile relations with surrounding countries, Israel must launch its vehicles to the west, over the Mediterranean Sea, in order to avoid flying over those countries. This necessity imposes a penalty of 30 percent on the Shavit’s lifting capability, since the Shavit is unable to take advantage of the velocity imparted by Earth’s rotation.
