Pietro Angelo Secchi,  (born June 29, 1818, Reggio nell’Emilia, duchy of Modena [now in Italy]—died  Feb. 26, 1878, Rome, Italy), Italian Jesuit priest and astrophysicist, who made the first survey of the spectra of stars and suggested that stars be classified according to their spectral type.
Secchi entered the Society of Jesus in 1833 and became lecturer in physics and mathematics at the Jesuit College in Loreto, Italy, in 1839. He returned to Rome in 1844, where he completed his theological studies and lectured at the Roman College.
When the Jesuits were expelled from Rome in 1848, Secchi went to Stonyhurst College, Clitheroe, Lancashire, Eng., and then to Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. Because of his reputation as an astronomer, he was allowed to return to Rome in 1849, where he became professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at the Roman College. He erected a new observatory in which he carried out his research in stellar spectroscopy, terrestrial magnetism, and meteorology.
From his survey of stellar spectra, Secchi concluded that stars could be arranged in four classes according to the type of spectra they display. These divisions were later expanded into the Harvard classification system, which is based on a simple temperature sequence. Secchi proved that prominences seen during a solar eclipse are features on the Sun itself, and he discovered many aspects of their behaviour and of the finer prominence-like jets of gases now known as spicules.
