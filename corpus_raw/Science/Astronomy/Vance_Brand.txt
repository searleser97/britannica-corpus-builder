Vance Brand, in full Vance DeVoe Brand,  (born May 9, 1931, Longmont, Colorado, U.S.),  American astronaut who was command pilot for several historic space ventures, including the first joint U.S.-Soviet crewed space mission and the first fully operational space shuttle mission.
Brand gained flight experience as an aviator with the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve from 1953 to 1957 and graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, Patuxent, Maryland, in 1963. He subsequently worked as an engineering test pilot for the Lockheed Company until 1966, when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) chose him to be an astronaut. Brand was backup command module pilot for Apollo 15 and backup commander for the Skylab 3 and 4 missions prior to being named command pilot for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP).
The ASTP involved the rendezvous (July 15–24, 1975) in Earth orbit of an Apollo craft with a Soyuz space capsule. After docking together, the combined crews conducted scientific experiments. Brand was commander on the fifth space shuttle flight (STS-5; November 11–16, 1982), on which the shuttle Columbia first launched two satellites into orbit. On his third space mission, Brand was commander of the Challenger space shuttle (STS-41-B; February 3–11, 1984). Although this trip was plagued by several malfunctions and two communications satellites were misdirected, Bruce McCandless’s performance of the first space walk without a lifeline and the successful return of the shuttle to its home base were regarded as major accomplishments. Brand’s fourth space mission (STS-35; December 2–10, 1990) carried the ASTRO-1 observatory, which consisted of three ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope.
Brand left the astronaut corps in 1992, but he continued to work with NASA in a variety of positions, mainly at the Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, until his retirement in 2008.
