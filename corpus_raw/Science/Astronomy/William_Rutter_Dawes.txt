William Rutter Dawes,  (born March 19, 1799, London—died  Feb. 15, 1868, Haddenham, Buckinghamshire, Eng.), English astronomer known for his extensive measurements of double stars and for his meticulous planetary observations.
Trained as a physician, Dawes practiced at Haddenham and (from 1826) Liverpool; subsequently he became a Nonconformist clergyman. In 1829 he set up a private observatory at Ormskirk, Lancashire, where he measured more than 200 double stars before taking charge of George Bishop’s Observatory at South Villa, Regent’s Park, London, in 1839. He later set up private observatories at Cranbrook, Kent (1844); Wateringbury, Kent (1850); and Haddenham (1857). He was one of several independent discoverers of the “crepe ring” of Saturn (1850); he observed Jupiter’s Great Red Spot (1857) several years before its existence was generally recognized; and he prepared exceptionally accurate drawings of Mars in 1864. Dawes received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1855 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1865. A crater on the Moon is named after him.
