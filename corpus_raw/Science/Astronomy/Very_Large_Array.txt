Very Large Array (VLA),  radio telescope system situated on the plains of San Agustin near Socorro, New Mexico, U.S. The VLA went into operation in 1980 and is the most powerful radio telescope in the world. It is operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.
The VLA consists of 27 parabolic dishes that are each 25 metres (82 feet) in diameter. Each dish can be moved independently by transporter along rails laid out in an enormous Y pattern. (The arms of this pattern extend about 21 km [13 miles] each.) The resolution of the VLA is altered by changing the positions of the dishes. The radio signals recorded by the component dishes are integrated by computer to give a resolving power equal to that of a single dish as large as 36 km (22 miles) in diameter, depending on the configuration of the array and the wavelength being observed. The VLAâ€™s maximum angular resolution is better than a tenth of an arc second, comparable to that of the Hubble Space Telescope at optical wavelengths.
