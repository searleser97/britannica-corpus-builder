Omega Centauri,  (catalog number NGC 5139), the brightest globular star cluster. It is located in the southern constellation Centaurus. It has a magnitude of 3.7 and is visible to the unaided eye as a faint luminous patch. Omega Centauri is about 16,000 light-years from Earth and is thus one of the nearer globular clusters. It is estimated to contain several million stars; several hundred variables have been observed in it. There is some evidence for a black hole at the centre of Omega Centauri that is 40,000 times as massive as the Sun. The English astronomer John Herschel in the 1830s was the first to recognize it as a star cluster and not a nebula.
