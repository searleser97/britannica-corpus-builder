Long-period variable star,  any intrinsically variable star whose light fluctuations are fairly regular and require many months or several years to complete one cycle. They are, without exception, red giant and supergiant stars. Those in one fairly distinct group with periods of about 200 days belong generally to the larger class of stars called Population II (older stars found mainly in the galactic core and halo). Another group, that of variables with periods of a year or more, mostly belong to Population I (younger stars found generally in the spiral arms of a galaxy).
A long-period variable may change a hundredfold in visual brightness, but the variation in energy output is much smaller because at the low temperature of such a star most energy is released at infrared wavelengths rather than as light. Long-period variables are sometimes called Mira stars, after Mira Ceti (Omicron Ceti) in the constellation Cetus, the first star recognized to be variable.
