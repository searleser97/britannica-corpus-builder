Bart J. Bok, in full Bart Jan Bok,  (born April 28, 1906, Hoorn, Netherlands—died August 7, 1983, Tucson, Arizona, U.S.), Dutch-born American astronomer known for his work on the structure and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy and for his study of “Bok globules,” small dark clouds observable against the background of bright nebulae. Bok suggested that these globules may be condensed clouds of interstellar gas and dust in the process of contracting into stars.
Bok studied at the Universities of Leiden and Groningen (Ph.D. 1932). He then pursued an academic career of research and teaching at Harvard University (1929–57), the Australian National University (1957–66), and the University of Arizona (1966–74), remaining at Arizona as professor emeritus; he had become a U.S. citizen in 1938. He served as director of the Mount Stromlo Observatory (1957–66) in Australia and as director of the Steward Observatory (1966–70) in Arizona. With his wife, Priscilla F. Bok, he wrote the classic work The Milky Way (1941; 5th ed., 1981). Bok served as vice president of the International Astronomical Union (1970–76) and as president of the American Astronomical Society (1972–74).
