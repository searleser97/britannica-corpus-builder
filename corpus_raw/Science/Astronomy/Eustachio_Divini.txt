Eustachio Divini,  (born October 4, 1610, San Severino delle Marche, near Ancona, Papal States [now in Italy]â€”died 1685, Rome), Italian scientist, one of the first to develop the technology necessary for producing scientific optical instruments.
After some scientific training under Benedetto Castelli, a disciple of Galileo, Divini established himself in Rome in 1646 as a maker of clocks and lenses. He constructed a number of compound microscopes and long-focus telescopes, the latter consisting of wooden tubes with four lenses, with a focal length of more than 15 m (50 feet).
In 1649 Divini published a copper engraving of a map of the Moon, based on his own observations made with his invention. He also made a number of astronomical observations, including some of the rings of Saturn and the spots and satellites of Jupiter. Many of his microscopes and telescopes have survived in museums in Florence, Rome, Padua, and elsewhere.
