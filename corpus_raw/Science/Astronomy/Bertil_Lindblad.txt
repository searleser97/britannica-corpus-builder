Bertil Lindblad,  (born Nov. 26, 1895, Örebro, Swed.—died June 26, 1965, Stockholm), Swedish astronomer who contributed greatly to the theory of galactic structure and motion and to the methods of determining the absolute magnitude (true brightness, disregarding distance) of distant stars.
After serving as an assistant at the observatory in Uppsala, Swed., Lindblad joined the Stockholm Observatory and in 1927 was appointed director, a post he held until 1965. He planned the observatory’s relocation in 1931 to nearby Saltsjöbaden and modernized its facilities.
By the early 1920s the Dutch astronomer Jacobus C. Kapteyn and others had made statistical studies establishing that generally stars appear to move in one of two directions in space. In 1926 Lindblad successfully explained this phenomenon (called star streaming) as an effect of rotation of the Milky Way and thus became the first to offer substantial evidence that the Galaxy rotates. This theory was definitely proved soon after by Jan Oort of the Netherlands.
Lindblad also pioneered in studies to determine the absolute magnitude of distant stars from the stellar spectra (the characteristic individual wavelengths of light). Establishing his own spectral classification system, he used it to determine absolute magnitudes and, thence, the distance and transverse velocities of many distant stars.
Lindblad was president of the International Astronomical Union (1948–52).
