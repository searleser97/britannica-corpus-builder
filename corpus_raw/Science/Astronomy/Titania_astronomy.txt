Titania,  largest of the moons of Uranus. It was first detected telescopically in 1787 by the English astronomer William Herschel, who had discovered Uranus itself six years earlier. Titania was named by William’s son, John Herschel, for a character in William Shakespeare’s play A Midsummer Night’s Dream.
Titania orbits at a mean distance of 435,840 km (270,820 miles) from the centre of Uranus, which makes it the second outermost of the planet’s major moons. Its orbital period is 8.706 days, as is its rotational period. It is thus in synchronous rotation, keeping the same face toward the planet and the same face forward in its orbit. Its diameter is 1,578 km (980 miles), and it has a density of about 1.71 grams per cubic cm. Titania appears to be composed of equal parts water ice and rocky material; a small amount of frozen methane is probably present as well. (For comparative data about Titania and other Uranian satellites, see the table.)
Titania was observed close up on only one occasion, when the U.S. Voyager 2 spacecraft swiftly flew through the Uranian system in 1986. Spacecraft images show its surface to have many bright impact craters up to 50 km (30 miles) in diameter, but few large ones, along with trenches and a deep fault line extending roughly 1,600 km (1,000 miles). These and other related features strongly suggest the occurrence of internal geologic processes in the moon’s ancient past.
