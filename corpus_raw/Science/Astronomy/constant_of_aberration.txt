Constant of aberration,  in astronomy, the maximum amount of the apparent yearly aberrational displacement of a star or other celestial body, resulting from Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun. The value of the constant, 20.49551″ of arc, depends on the ratio of Earth’s orbital velocity to the velocity of light. James Bradley, the British astronomer who in 1728 discovered the aberration of starlight, estimated the value of the constant at about 20″ and from this calculated the velocity of light at 295,000 km (183,300 miles) per second—within a few thousand kilometres per second of the presently accepted value of 299,792 km (186,282 miles) per second. The aberrational ellipse described by the image of a star in the course of a year has a major axis equal in angular distance to twice the constant of aberration.
