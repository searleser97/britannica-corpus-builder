SMART-1, in full Small Missions for Advanced Research and Technology-1,  first lunar probe of the European Space Agency. SMART-1 was launched on Sept. 27, 2003. The 367-kg (809-pound) probe had a xenon-ion engine that generated only 7 grams (0.2 ounce) of thrust, but it was sufficient to nudge SMART-1 from its first stop (the first Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun) into lunar orbit on Nov. 15, 2003. Once there, SMART-1 scanned the Moon for signs of water in polar craters and mapped the lunar terrain. When its mission ended, it was crashed into the Moon on Sept. 3, 2006, and telescopes on Earth observed the impact in order to study the lunar surface.
