Scorpius X-1,  (catalog number Sco X-1), brightest X-ray source in the sky, the first such object discovered in the direction of the constellation Scorpius. Detected in 1962, its X-radiation is not only strong but, like other X-ray sources, quite variable as well. Its variability exhibits two states, one at higher output with great variability on a time scale of minutes and another at lower output with the variability correspondingly lessened.
Scorpius X-1 was observed in visible light for the first time in 1966. Optically it is much less impressive, bluish in colour and appearing only faintly. Scorpius X-1 is a close double star, one component of which is optically invisibleâ€”a neutron star. The X-rays are generated when matter from the optically visible, bluish hot star falls onto the neutron star. This matter is tremendously accelerated and crushed by the enormous gravity of the neutron star. Unlike the majority of binary X-ray sources, the visible member does not appear to be very massive; it is only 42 percent the mass of the Sun. The neutron star is 1.4 solar masses. Scorpius X-1 is about 9,000 light-years from Earth.
