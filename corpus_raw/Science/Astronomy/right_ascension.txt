Right ascension,  in astronomy, the east–west coordinate by which the position of a celestial body is ordinarily measured; more precisely, it is the angular distance of a body’s hour circle east of the vernal equinox, measured along the celestial equator. It is often expressed in units of time rather than degrees of arc. Right ascension and declination define the position of a celestial object. The symbol for right ascension is the Greek letter α  (alpha). See also hour angle.
