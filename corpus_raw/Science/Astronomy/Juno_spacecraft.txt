Juno,  U.S. space probe that is designed to orbit Jupiter. It is named for the Roman goddess who was the female counterpart to the god Jupiter. Juno was launched by an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on August 5, 2011. On October 9, 2013, it flew by Earth for a gravity boost on its journey to Jupiter, where it arrived on July 4, 2016. Juno orbits Jupiter every 11 days in a highly elliptical orbit (4,400 by 2,700,000 km [2,700 by 1,700,000 miles]) over the planet’s poles. Unlike previous probes to the outer solar system, Juno is solar-powered. Because of Jupiter’s distance from the Sun, Juno’s three arrays of solar panels total more than 20 metres (66 feet) in length. Juno carries several instruments to study Jupiter’s auroras, magnetosphere, atmosphere, and gravitational field. The Juno mission is scheduled to last five years before the space probe will be deliberately burned up in Jupiter’s atmosphere. Juno is the second project in NASA’s New Frontiers program of solar system missions, of which the first was New Horizons.
