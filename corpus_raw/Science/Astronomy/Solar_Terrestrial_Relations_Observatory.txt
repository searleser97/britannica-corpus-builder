Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO),  two U.S. spacecraft that were designed to observe the Sun from separate locations in space and thus provide a stereoscopic view of solar activities. The STEREO mission was launched on Oct. 25, 2006, by a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. The Moon’s gravity was used to pitch the satellites into different places along Earth’s orbit, where one would orbit the Sun ahead of Earth and the other following Earth. After two years the two spacecraft formed a 90° angle with the Sun, and by February 2011 they were on opposite sides of the Sun and thus provided the first images of the entire Sun. Each spacecraft carried an ultraviolet telescope, a coronagraph, and other instruments. In addition to making stereoscopic images of the Sun, STEREO also detected the heliosheath, the place before the heliopause where solar wind particles decelerate when they encounter the interstellar medium.
