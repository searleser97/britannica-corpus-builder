Ōsumi,  first Earth satellite orbited by Japan. It was launched on Feb. 11, 1970, from Kagoshima Space Center on Kyushu and was named for the peninsula on which the centre is located. Ōsumi consisted of the fourth stage of the U.S.-built Lambda-4S launch rocket that was used to place it into an elliptic orbit 250 miles (400 km) above the Earth. It was equipped with several sounding devices and weighed 40 pounds (18 kg). Its purpose was to practice using a rocket to put a satellite into orbit. Ōsumi was destroyed upon reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere in 2003.
