Heinrich Louis d’Arrest,  (born July 13, 1822, Berlin, Prussia [Germany]—died  June 14, 1875, Copenhagen, Den.), German astronomer who, while a student at the Berlin Observatory, hastened the discovery of Neptune by suggesting comparison of the sky, in the region indicated by Urbain Le Verrier’s calculations, with a recently prepared star chart. The planet was found the same night.
In 1851, while associated with the Leipzig Observatory, d’Arrest discovered a periodic comet that was subsequently named for him. In that same year he published a book on the 13 asteroids known at that time and began his studies of the nebulae for which he received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1875.
