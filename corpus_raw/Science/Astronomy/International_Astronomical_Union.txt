International Astronomical Union (IAU),  senior body governing international professional astronomical activities worldwide, with headquarters in Paris. It was established in 1919 as the first of a series of international unions for the advancement of specific branches of science. Its professed mission is to promote and safeguard the science of astronomy in all its aspects through international cooperation.
The IAU is made up of various divisions, commissions, and working groups representing the various areas of astronomical research, teaching, and other endeavours. In the early 21st century it had a membership of some 8,000 professional astronomers from about 60 adhering countries. It is the only organization recognized professionally for the naming of astronomical bodies, which it does solely on the basis of merit, history, or discovererâ€™s privilege. The IAU holds a general assembly every three years in varying parts of the world at which professional astronomers meet to discuss research, new cooperative ventures, and similar matters of professional interest.
