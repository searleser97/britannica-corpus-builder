Galactic coordinate,  in astronomy, galactic latitude or longitude. The two coordinates constitute a useful means of locating the relative positions and motions of components of the Milky Way Galaxy. Galactic latitude (denoted by the symbol b) is measured in degrees north or south of the Galaxy’s fundamental plane of symmetry. This plane is defined by the galactic equator, the great circle in the sky best fitting the plane of the Milky Way, as determined by a combination of optical and radio measurements. The galactic equator is inclined at about 62°36′ to the celestial equator, which is the projection of Earth’s Equator into the sky.
Galactic longitude (denoted by the symbol l) is measured in degrees eastward of an imaginary line running across the plane of the Galaxy and connecting Earth (assumed to be on that plane) with a point near the galactic centre in the constellation Sagittarius. Before 1958, galactic longitude was measured from an arbitrarily chosen point, an intersection of the galactic and celestial equators in the constellation Aquila. The development of radio astronomy and rediscussion of optical results led to a more accurate determination of the position of the galactic centre and its adoption in 1958 as the new zero point of longitude. (Subsequent observations have identified the radio source Sagittarius A*, which is offset from the longitude zero point, as the true centre of the Milky Way Galaxy.)
At the same time, the positions of the galactic poles and equator were redefined, with a change of less than 2° in the positions of the poles. The north galactic pole is now considered to be in the constellation Coma Berenices, at +90° galactic latitude, and with equatorial (Earth-based) coordinates of 12 hours 49 minutes right ascension, 27°24′ north declination.
