Lewis Boss,  (born October 26, 1846, Providence, Rhode Island, U.S.â€”died October 5, 1912, Albany, New York), American astronomer best known for his compilation of star catalogs.
Boss worked for the U.S. government at Washington, D.C., and on a survey of the U.S.-Canadian border. In 1876 he became director of the Dudley Observatory at Albany, and in 1882 he led an expedition to Chile to observe a transit of Venus. About 1895 Boss began to plan a general catalog of stars, giving their positions and motions. The project was supported by the Carnegie Institution, Washington, D.C., after 1906. With an enlarged staff he observed the northern stars from Albany and the southern stars from Argentina. With the new data, he corrected catalogs that had been compiled in the past, and in 1910 he published the Preliminary General Catalogue of 6,188 Stars for the Epoch 1900. Though he died leaving his work unfinished, his son Benjamin completed it in 1937 (General Catalogue of 33,342 Stars for the Epoch 1950, 5 vol.).
