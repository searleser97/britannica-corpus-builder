Corona Borealis, (Latin: “Northern Crown”)  constellation in the northern sky at about 16 hours right ascension and 30° north in declination. Its brightest star is Alphecca, with a magnitude of 2.2. The star R Coronae Borealis is the prototype of a group of unusual variable stars that dim in brightness over the course of a few weeks and return slowly and irregularly to their previous level over several months. The constellation has a shape like an open semicircle. (The Australian Aborigines called it “the boomerang.”) In Greek mythology this constellation is the crown the god Dionysus presented to the Cretan princess Ariadne on the isle of Náxos.
