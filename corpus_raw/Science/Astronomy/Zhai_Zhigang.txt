Zhai Zhigang,  (born October 10, 1966, Longjiang, Qiqihar, Heilongjiang, China), Chinese astronaut who performed China’s first spacewalk.
Zhai was the child of an illiterate mother who peddled sunflower seeds to pay for her children’s education. He joined the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and won entry into the PLA Army Air Force Aviation Institute, where he became a fighter pilot. As a pilot he logged 1,000 hours of flight time and rose to the rank of colonel. He was selected from more than 1,500 candidates in 1998 to enter astronaut training for China’s crewed spaceflight program.
With a dozen other taikonauts (the Chinese equivalent of astronauts), he spent five years studying the science and operation of spacecraft and undergoing physical and psychological training. In 2003 he was among the final candidates to pilot Shenzhou 5, China’s first crewed spaceflight, and served as the backup to Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei. He was again a backup in 2006 for the Shenzhou 6 mission.
On September 25, 2008, after 10 years of waiting and preparation, Zhai lifted off as commander with two other crew members, Liu Buoming and Jing Haipeng, aboard Shenzhou 7 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in Gansu province, northwestern China. The crew spent three days in Earth orbit. On the second day, as a camera broadcast the event live to audiences in China, Zhai left the orbital module to walk in space. The crew returned safely to Earth on September 27 in the Shenzhou’s reentry module, which parachuted to the ground in the northern grasslands of China.
