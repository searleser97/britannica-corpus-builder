NGC catalog, in full A New General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars, being the Catalogue of the Late Sir John F. W. Herschel, Bart., revised, corrected, and enlarged,  basic reference list of star clusters, nebulas, and galaxies. It was compiled in 1888 by Danish astronomer Johan Ludvig Emil Dreyer, who based his work on earlier lists made by the Herschel family of British astronomers. Dreyer included 7,840 celestial objects, a total raised to 13,226 by his first and second Index Catalogues (IC), published in 1895 and 1908, respectively. With these supplements the NGC covers the entire sky, although many objects visible with modern instruments are not listed.
An object may be known by several designations; e.g., the Crab Nebula is also called NGC 1952 and M1, the latter being its number in the Messier catalog.
