Farkas was chosen as a cosmonaut candidate in 1978 as a member of the Intercosmos program’s fifth international crew. The non-Soviet cosmonauts of Intercosmos flew alongside Soviet crews on missions intended to demonstrate unity between Warsaw Pact and other countries sympathetic to the Soviet Union.

Farkas took part in several medical, biological, physical, and materials science experiments on board the Salyut 6 space station. He returned from space aboard Soyuz 35, landing on Earth on June 3, 1980. He was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and received the Order of Lenin.
After his flight Farkas returned to the Hungarian air force. In subsequent years he worked as a scientist at the Technical University of Budapest (now known as the Budapest University of Technology and Economics) and received a degree from its faculty of transport engineering in 1986. Farkas later served as the air force attaché at the Hungarian embassy in Washington, D.C., from 1996 to 1997. He retired from the Hungarian air force as a brigadier general in 1997.
