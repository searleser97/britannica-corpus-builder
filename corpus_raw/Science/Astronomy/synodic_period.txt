Synodic period,   the time required for a body within the solar system, such as a planet, the Moon, or an artificial Earth satellite, to return to the same or approximately the same position relative to the Sun as seen by an observer on the Earth. The Moon’s synodic period is the time between successive recurrences of the same phase; e.g., between full moon and full moon. The synodic period of a planet is the time required for the Earth to overtake it as both go around the Sun—or, in the case of fast-moving Mercury or Venus, for the planet in question to overtake the Earth. The synodic period of an artificial satellite of the Earth is measured between its conjunctions (closest apparent approaches) with the Sun. See also sidereal period.
