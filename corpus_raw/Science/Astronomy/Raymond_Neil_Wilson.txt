Raymond Neil Wilson,  (born March 23, 1928, Sutton Coldfield, England—died March 16, 2018, Rohrbach, Germany), British physicist who pioneered the field of active optics.
Wilson received a bachelor’s degree in physics from Birmingham University. He received a doctoral degree from Imperial College in London. In 1961 he joined the German optical firm Carl Zeiss in Oberkochen and became head of the design department for telescopes. In 1972 he joined the European Southern Observatory (ESO) at Garching, West Germany.
Prior to the 1980s, telescope mirrors were limited to diameters of 6 metres (236 inches) because larger mirrors would sag under their own weight and thus be unable to maintain the precise parabolic shape necessary for astronomical observations. Wilson’s solution involved using a thin mirror whose shape could be changed by actuators attached to its rear surface. This technique of active optics was first tried on the New Technology Telescope at La Silla, Chile, in 1989 and was later used in 1998 for the four telescopes that make up the Very Large Telescope on Cerro Paranal, Chile.
Wilson retired from ESO in 1992. He was the author of Reflecting Telescope Optics I: Basic Design Theory and Its Historical Development (1996) and Reflecting Telescope Optics II: Manufacture, Testing, Alignment, Modern Techniques (1999).
