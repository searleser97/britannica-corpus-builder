David H. Levy,  (born May 22, 1948, Montreal, Que., Can.), Canadian astronomer and science writer who discovered—along with Carolyn Shoemaker and Eugene Shoemaker—the fragmented comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in 1993.
Levy developed an interest in astronomy at an early age, but in college he studied English literature, receiving a bachelor’s degree from Acadia (Nova Scotia) University and a master’s degree from Queen’s University, in Kingston, Ont. Because of his interest in astronomy, Levy was an ardent comet watcher; by the beginning of the 1990s, he had discovered more than 20 comets. He first met the Shoemakers in 1988, when the couple was tracking a comet he had discovered. In March 1993 the team discovered Shoemaker-Levy 9 in orbit around the planet Jupiter while they were working at the Palomar Observatory in southern California.
 In 1994 Levy and the Shoemakers watched through telescopes as the major fragments of Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter. Following months of speculation as to what the impacts would entail, the event itself proved equal to the most optimistic predictions. From the atmosphere of a bruised and battered Jupiter arose tall, bright plumes that left broad, dark stains beneath them, providing a spectacular show for sky watchers around the world.
A science writer by trade, Levy was the author of several books on astronomy, including The Quest for Comets (1994), Skywatching (1994), Shoemaker by Levy (2000), and A Guide to Skywatching (2002). He also contributed to the magazine Sky and Telescope.
