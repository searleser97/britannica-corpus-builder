Cryptostomata,  order of bryozoans (small colonial animals) found as fossils in rocks of Ordovician to Permian age (between 488 million and 251 million years old). Many holes are exhibited, which probably contained individual animals of the colony. Cryptostome colonies consist of groups of short, individual tubes.
