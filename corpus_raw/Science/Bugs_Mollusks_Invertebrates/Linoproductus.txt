Linoproductus,  genus of extinct articulate brachiopods (lamp shells) found throughout the midcontinent region of North America as fossils in Early Carboniferous to Late Permian rocks (from about 359 million to about 251 million years ago). The genus Linoproductus is a distinctive invertebrate form distinguished by its strongly convex pedicle valve and its slightly concave brachial valve. Fine ribbing is present on the convex shell.
