Lion’s mane jellyfish,  (Cyanea capillata),  marine jellyfish of the class Scyphozoa (phylum Cnidaria) found in the waters of the colder oceans of the Northern Hemisphere. Some populations, however, occur as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. It is the largest known jellyfish in the world.
The body of the lion’s mane jellyfish is characterized by an eight-lobed bell with 70–150 trailing tentacles. The colour of the bell in smaller individuals ranges from light orange to tan, whereas that of larger specimens ranges from deep orange to dark crimson. The largest individuals, which are found in the Arctic Ocean, measure as much as 2.4 metres (8 feet) in diameter and 36.5 metres (about 120 feet) in length—about 7 metres (about 23 feet) longer than the longest known blue whale.
The animal is generally found within the first 20 metres (65 feet) of the ocean’s surface, where it feeds on zooplankton, small fishes, and ctenophores (comb jellies) as well as other jellyfish. The lion’s mane jellyfish captures its prey by delivering a sting loaded with neurotoxins from the nematocysts (stinging cells) on its tentacles. After the prey has become immobilized, specialized tentacles called oral arms transport the prey to its mouth. The lion’s mane jellyfish is preyed upon by sea turtles (which do not seem to be affected by the neurotoxins), birds, and larger fishes as well as other jellyfish.
Like other jellyfish, the lion’s mane jellyfish can reproduce either sexually or asexually. It hatches, grows, reproduces, and dies within about one year. Near the end of the animal’s lifetime, it assembles with other individuals in sheltered nearshore areas, and some individuals are washed by the tide onto adjacent beaches and rocks.
