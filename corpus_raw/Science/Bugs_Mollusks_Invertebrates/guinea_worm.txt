Guinea worm,  (Dracunculus medinensis), also called medina worm or dragon worm,  member of the phylum Nematoda. The guinea worm, a parasite of humans, is found in tropical regions of Asia and Africa and in the West Indies and tropical South America. A variety of other mammals are also parasitized by guinea worms. The disease caused by the worm is called guinea worm disease (or dracunculiasis).
The female grows to a length of 50 to 120 cm (about 20 to 48 inches), while the male (which is rarely found because it dies upon mating within a human or other host) measures only 12 to 29 mm (about 0.5 to 1.1 inches). Both sexes live in the connective tissue of various organs of the host. Females may live for 10 to 14 months. The female bores close to the skin surface, at which point a blister develops and finally bursts. Millions of larvae are released with the blister fluid. If the larvae are discharged into a watery medium, they are eaten by water fleas (Cyclops), which are a type of crustacean. They develop in the crustaceanâ€™s body into larvae capable of infecting humans.
