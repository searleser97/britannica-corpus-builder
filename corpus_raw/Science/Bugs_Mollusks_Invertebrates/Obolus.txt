Obolus,  genus of extinct brachiopod, or lamp shell, of the Cambrian Period (from 542 million to 488 million years ago). Obolus was a small animal with a spherical shape; one valve, or shell, was larger than the other. Unlike the shells of its relatives, the lingulids, the obolus shells were composed of calcium carbonate. Obolus inhabited shallow marine waters.
