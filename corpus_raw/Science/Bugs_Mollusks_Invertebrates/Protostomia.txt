Protostomia,  group of animals—including the arthropods (e.g., insects, crabs), mollusks (clams, snails), annelid worms, and some other groups—classified together largely on the basis of embryological development. The mouth of the Protostomia (proto, “first”; stoma, “mouth”) develops from the first opening into the embryonic gut (blastopore). The coelom (body cavity) forms from a split in the embryonic mesoderm (middle tissue). In addition, cell fates become fixed at the first cleavage of the early embryo, so separated cells cannot form twins. Larval (immature) forms, if present, are called trochophores. The Protostomia constitute one of two divisions of the coelomates (animals with a body cavity, or coelom). Compare Deuterostomia.
