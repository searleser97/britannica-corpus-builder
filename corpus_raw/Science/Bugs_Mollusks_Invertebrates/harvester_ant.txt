Harvester ant,  any of several different genera of ants (e.g., Messor, Atta, Pheidole, Pogonomyrmex) that gather seeds and leaves. Messor species collect, husk, and store seeds in their nests. Atta species collect leaves and use them to grow fungi, which they eat.
Some Pheidole members have large strong jaws that are probably used to crush the harvested seeds. Pogonomyrmex, another seed harvester, can inflict a painful sting. See ant.
