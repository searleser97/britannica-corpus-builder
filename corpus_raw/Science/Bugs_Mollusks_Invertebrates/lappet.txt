Lappet,   any member of the insect genus Tolype of the Lasiocampidae family of moths (order Lepidoptera). The genus includes the eggars, named for their egg-shaped cocoons, and the tent caterpillars, which spin huge, tent-shaped communal webs in trees. Lappets in the larval stage have lateral lobes, or lappets, on each segment of their body.
Adults are stoutbodied and usually bluish gray, with a typical wingspan of 25 to 75 mm (1 to 3 inches). Many species have feathery antennae and hairy bodies, legs, and eyes. The larvae are often brightly coloured and can defoliate forest, fruit, and ornamental trees. T. laricis larvae feed on larch, while T. vellida prefers apple, poplar, and syringa.
