Constellaria,   genus of extinct bryozoans (small colonial animals that produce a skeletal framework of calcium carbonate) especially characteristic of Ordovician marine rocks (505 to 438 million years old). The structure of Constellaria is branching and generally flattened front to back with prominent bumps. Constellaria sometimes is found in sedimentary rocks or the shells of other animals.
