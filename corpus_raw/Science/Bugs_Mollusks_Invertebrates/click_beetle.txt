Click beetle,  (family Elateridae), also called skipjack, snapping beetle, or spring beetle,  any of approximately 7,000 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) named for the clicking noise made when seized by a predator. Most click beetles range between 2.5 and 18 mm (less than 0.75 inch) in length and are brown or black in colour with either little or no ornamentation. However, some tropical species are brightly coloured or luminescent. Click beetles have elongated bodies with parallel sides and bluntly rounded ends.
When a click beetle is touched, it falls on its back and plays dead. To right itself the click beetle bends its head and thorax forward, hooking a spine into a notch on the abdomen. When the spine is released, it makes a click, and the beetle is hurled into the air. Click beetles usually feed on leaves at night. Because they are attracted to sweet liquids, farmers once placed sweet baits in their fields in the spring to trap adults.
Click beetle larvae have a hard exoskeleton and are known as wireworms because of their long, slender, cylindrical shape. They can be destructive plant pests, attacking seeds, plant roots, and underground stems. The larvae live in the soil from two to six years. The plowing of fields in the fall can cut open the pupal case and destroy the wireworms. If necessary, applications of appropriate insecticides may help control wireworm populations.
The eyed elator (Alaus oculatus), a North American click beetle, grows to 45 mm (over 1.75 inches) long and has two large black-and-white eyelike spots on the prothorax, a region behind the head. The genus Pyrophorus, which occurs in the tropical areas of the Western Hemisphere, is luminescent, giving off a greenish and red-orange light. Several of these species can provide light sufficient for reading, and they have even been used as emergency light sources during surgery.
