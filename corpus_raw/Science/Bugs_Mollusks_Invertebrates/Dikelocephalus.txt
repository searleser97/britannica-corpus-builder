Dikelocephalus,   genus of trilobites (extinct arthropods) that is a useful guide fossil for the Late Cambrian rocks (512 to 505 million years ago) of Europe and North America. Dikelocephalus is distinguished by its broad head, its large and relatively well-developed tail, and its pair of short spines at the end of the tail. The eyes of Dikelocephalus are large and crescentic in shape.
