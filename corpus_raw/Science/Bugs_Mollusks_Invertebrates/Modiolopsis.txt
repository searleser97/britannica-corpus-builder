Modiolopsis,  extinct genus of pelecypods (clams) found as fossils in Ordovician rocks (about 488 million to 444 million years old). Its form and structure is distinct, with a shell roughly elliptical in outline and broader at the margins. Markings on the shell consist of prominent growth lines in an arcuate or concentric pattern. Modiolopsis is a useful guide fossil for Ordovician rocks.
