Flat bug,  (family Aradidae), also called fungus bug,  any of about 1,000 species of  small, flat, dark-coloured insects (order Heteroptera) that are usually found under stones, in crevices in dead or dying trees, or under loose bark. Nearly all flat bugs range in size from 3 to 11 mm (0.12 to 0.43 inch) and feed on fungi and sap in decaying wood. Their wings, though well developed, remain quite small. Species occur in all zoogeographic regions.
