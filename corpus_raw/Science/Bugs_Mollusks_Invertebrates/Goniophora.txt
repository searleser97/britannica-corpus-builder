Goniophora,  extinct genus of clams found in Silurian to Devonian rocks (the Silurian Period began 444 million years ago and lasted about 28 million years; it was followed by the Devonian, which lasted some 57 million years). Goniophora is characterized by a distinctive shell that is sharply angular. A prominent ridge extends the length of the shell; from it the shell flanks taper away. Fine growth lines extend about the shell.
