Bird louse,  (suborder Amblycera and Ischnocera),  any of two groups of chewing lice (order Phthiraptera) that live on birds and feed on feathers, skin, and sometimes blood. Probably all bird species have these chewing lice. Although they are not harmful, if they become too numerous, their irritation may cause the bird to damage itself by scratching and may even interfere with egg production and the fattening of poultry.
Birds with damaged bills are often heavily infested because they cannot preen themselves properly. Two important species of chewing lice are the chicken louse, Menopon pallidum, and the pigeon louse, Lipeurus baculus.
Some authorities consider the two suborders as a single group called Mallophaga.
