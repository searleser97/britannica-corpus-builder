Cardioceras,  genus of ammonite cephalopods, extinct animals related to the modern pearly nautilus and characteristic as fossils in rocks of the Late Jurassic Period (about 161 million to 146 million years ago). The several species known are excellent index, or guide, fossils for Jurassic rocks, enabling them to be correlated over widely separated areas. The shell of Cardioceras is circular in outline and ribbed, with a prominent crest along the outer margin.
