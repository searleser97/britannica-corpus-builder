Flat bark beetle,  (family Cucujidae), also called cucujid or flat grain beetle,  any of approximately 500 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) that are red, yellow, or brown and easily recognized by their narrow, flattened bodies.
Cucujids can be found throughout the world. Most are less than 13 mm (0.5 inch) in length and are predacious on mites and small insects. Some have toothed margins on the pronotum (region behind the head). They are most often found under the bark of freshly felled hardwood trees. Some in the genus Catogenus parasitize the larvae of long-horned beetles (Cerambycidae) and some parasitic wasps (Braconidae). A few species, such as the saw-toothed grain beetle (Oryzaephilus surinamensis, sometimes placed in the family Silvanidae) and the rusty grain beetle (Cryptolestes ferrugineus), can be serious pests of stored grain.
