Lobed comb jelly,  any of several gelatinous, transparent marine invertebrates of the order Lobata (phylum Ctenophora). The animals are found in most oceans, especially in surface waters near the shore. Through the coordination of beating many rows of fused cilia, they are able to weakly propel themselves through the water. Lobed comb jellies (e.g., Mnemiopsis, Bolinopsis) are carnivorous, preying on tiny aquatic animals. Their tentacles, used in feeding, are smaller than those of other ctenophores, and the two oral lobes (structures surrounding the mouth) are greatly enlarged.
