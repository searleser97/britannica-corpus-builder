Nuculana,  very long-lived genus of mollusks (clams) that first appeared during the Silurian Period (443.7 million to 416 million years ago) and may still be found along beaches today. Nuculana is typical of a group of clams characterized by a small, teardrop-shaped shell that is globous anteriorly and pointed in the back. The hinge region is characterized by the presence of many small pits and ridges, sockets and teeth. Nuculana has an interior shell with two roughened areas at both ends where the muscles for closing the shell are located. Nuculana is active and moves about on the substrate.
