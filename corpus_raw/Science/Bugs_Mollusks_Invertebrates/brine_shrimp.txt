Brine shrimp,  (genus Artemia),  any of several small crustaceans of the order Anostraca (class Branchiopoda) inhabiting brine pools and other highly saline inland waters throughout the world. Measuring up to 15 mm (0.6 inch) in length, the body of the brine shrimp has a discrete head with a nauplius (larval) eye and stalked compound eyes, a thorax bearing a series of leaflike limbs, and a slender abdomen without appendages. Brine shrimp normally swim in an upside-down position by rhythmically beating their legs. They are consumed by birds (including flamingos, grebes, and avocets), water boatmen, fishes, and other crustaceans, and they feed primarily on green algae, which they filter from the water with their legs.
Brine shrimp belonging to the species Artemia salina, which occur in vast numbers in the Great Salt Lake, Utah, are of commercial importance. Young brine shrimp hatched there from dried eggs are used widely as food for fish and other small animals in aquariums. A. monica is endemic to Mono Lake, California, where it numbers in the trillions during the summer months and serves as a food source for migrating birds.
