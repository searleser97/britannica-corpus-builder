Deiphon,  genus of trilobites (extinct arthropods) easily recognized in fossil form in Silurian rocks in North America because of its highly unusual shape (the Silurian Period began 438 million years ago and ended 408 million years ago). The pleural lobes (at the sides of the body axis) are reduced except for the development of spiny segments. Strongly developed spines occur at the margins of the anterior region as well as at the posterior margin of the small tail region. The head region is strongly globose, with many small nodes on its surface.
