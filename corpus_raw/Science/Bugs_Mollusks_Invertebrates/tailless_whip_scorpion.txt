Tailless whip scorpion,  (order Amblypygi, sometimes Phrynichida),  any of 70 species of the arthropod class Arachnida that are similar in appearance to whip scorpions (order Uropygi) but lack a telson, or tail. They occur in hot parts of both North and South America, Asia, and Africa, where, by day, they hide under bark or stones. They often enter houses. An example is the 11-mm (0.4-inch) Tarantula marginemaculata of Florida.
Most of the species in this group have a body length of 8 to 45 mm (0.3 to 1.8 inches). The thorny-edged pedipalps (second pair of appendages) seize prey, and the third appendages are long, whiplike feelers.
