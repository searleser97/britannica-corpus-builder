Favosites,   extinct genus of corals found as fossils in marine rocks from the Ordovician to the Permian periods (between 488 million and 251 million years old). Favosites is easily recognized by its distinctive form; the genus is colonial, and the individual structures that house each coral animal are closely packed together as long, narrow tubes. In cross section, the structure has a distinctive honeycomb appearance.
