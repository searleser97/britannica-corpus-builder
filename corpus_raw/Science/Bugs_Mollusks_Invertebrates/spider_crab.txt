Spider crab,   any species of the decapod family Majidae (or Maiidae; class Crustacea). Spider crabs, which have thick, rather rounded bodies and long, spindly legs, are generally slow-moving and sluggish. Most are scavengers, especially of dead flesh.
Majids, a widely distributed marine group, are fished commercially in temperate waters, such as in the North Pacific. Some are quite small; for example, the long-beaked spider crab (Macropodia rostrata) of European coastal waters has a body about 1 cm (less than 0.5 inch) in diameter. The largest spider crab, and perhaps the largest known arthropod, is the giant crab (q.v.) of the Pacific waters near Japan. The outstretched claws of this crab (Macrocheira kaempferi) measure more than 4 m (13 feet) from tip to tip.
The head of the spider crab is rather beak-shaped; the body surface is generally covered with hairs, spines, and tubercles (knobby projections) that are frequently matted with algae, sponges, and other organisms. The crabs fasten a good deal of this material to themselves by means of a mucuslike secretion from the mouth.
The kelp crab (Pugettia producta), a spider crab found among seaweed on the Pacific coast from Canada to Mexico, is about 1.25 cm (0.5 inch) wide and 2.5 cm (1 inch) long. It is green and red on top and green underneath.
Parthenope investigatoris, a spider crab of the Indian Ocean, is camouflaged to resemble the coral on which it lives.
Spider crabs of the genera Libinia, Hyas, Sternorhynchus, Pitho, and Lambrus are common on the Atlantic coast of North America. Pacific coast spider crabs include the genera Loxorhynchus, Pugettia, and Epialtus.
Pisa, 1.3 to 6 cm (0.5 to 2.4 inches) long, is found in the Mediterranean Sea and in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Maja squinado, which attains lengths of 18 cm (7 inches), is found in the Mediterranean Sea and along the southwest coast of Europe.
