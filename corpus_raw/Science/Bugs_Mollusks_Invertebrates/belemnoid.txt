Belemnoid, also called belemnite,  member of an extinct group of cephalopods (animals related to the modern squid and octopus) that possessed a large internal shell. Most belemnoids were about the size of present-day squid, approximately 30 to 50 cm (12 to 20 inches) long. Belemnoids lived in ocean waters from the Early Devonian (about 416 million to 398 million years ago) until the end of the Cretaceous Period (65.5 million years ago). They became extinct during the Eocene Epoch, which ended about 34 million years ago. The internal shell was straight in most species but was loosely coiled in some. The shell was complex in structure and served for support and muscle attachment. It was also used for buoyancy, enabling the animal to compensate for depth and its own body weight, as in the modern chambered nautilus.
During the Jurassic and following Cretaceous periods, the belemnoids reached their greatest diversity and abundance. Belemnoids may have originated from the nautiloid cephalopods, animals related to the modern pearly nautilus. Many distinctive and easily recognized belemnoids are known. The fossils of some species are widespread and assist in the age correlation of widely separated rocks.
