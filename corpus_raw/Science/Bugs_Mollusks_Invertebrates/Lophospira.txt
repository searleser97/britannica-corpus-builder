Lophospira,  genus of extinct gastropods (snails) found as fossils in marine rocks of Ordovician to Devonian age (488 million to 359 million years old). The shell consists of a series of whorls arranged much like a series of ascending steps, each successive whorl smaller than the one below it. The apex of the shell is closed by a small cone-shaped whorl.
