Ensign wasp,  (family Evaniidae),  any of a group of wasps (order Hymenoptera) that are so named because the small, oval abdomen is held high like an ensign, or flag. A few hundred species of this widely distributed family have been described.
The body, which is black and somewhat spiderlike in appearance, ranges in length from about 1 to 1.5 cm (about 0.4 to 0.6 inch). Ensign wasps are beneficial to humans because all species are parasites of cockroaches, which are common household pests. The female places its eggs in the cockroachâ€™s egg case, and the wasp larvae devour the cockroach eggs. Evania appendigaster is a common North American species.
