Zorapteran,  (order Zoraptera),  any of a small group of about 30 species of insects found on every continent except Europe. These minute insects are less than 3 mm (1/8 inch) long and have chewing mouthparts and nine-segmented antennae. Most species are wingless and blind, although a few have two pairs of sparsely veined membranous wings and eyes.
Zorapterans live in colonies beneath the bark of rotting trees and in humus but have no social organization. They feed on other arthropods and fungal spores and are of little economic importance.
