Myalina,  extinct genus of clams found in rocks of Early Carboniferous to Late Permian age (dating from 359 million to 251 million years ago). Myalina belongs to an ancient group of clams, the Mytilacea, that first appeared in the earlier Ordovician Period (beginning about 488 million years ago). Myalina had a thicker shell than other mytilacids. Myalina, abundant in many rock formations, is important for stratigraphic correlations.
