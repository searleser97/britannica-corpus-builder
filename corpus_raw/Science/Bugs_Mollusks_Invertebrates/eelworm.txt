Eelworm,  any of several worms of the phylum Nematoda, so called because they resemble miniature eels. The term is most often applied to smaller nematodes that are either free-living or parasitic in plants.
Most eelworms are 0.1 to 1.5 millimetres (0.004 to 0.06 inch) long. They are found in all parts of the world. Free-living forms occur in salt water, fresh water, and damp soil. Parasitic forms are found in the roots of many plant species; the potato-root eelworm, Heterodera rostochiensis, for example, is a serious pest of potatoes. Some species occur in both animals and plants.
Eelworms and other nematodes were once placed in the now defunct phylum Aschelminthes. Modern anatomical, embryological, and molecular studies indicate that the former members of that phylum (nematodes, rotifers, kinorhynchs, and some other groups of mostly microscopic animals) have no close evolutionary relationship. Consequently, many of these new groups have been classified into their own separate phyla.
