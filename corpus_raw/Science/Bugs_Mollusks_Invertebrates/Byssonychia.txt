Byssonychia,  extinct genus of Ordovician pelecypods (clams) that serves as a useful index fossil for the Ordovician Period (488.3 million to 443.7 million years ago). The distinctive shell of Byssonychia, one of the earliest clam genera known, is roughly triangular in outline, tapering sharply to a prominent beak and bearing distinct linear ribbing on the surface. Only one distinct muscle scar is present on the inside of the shell.
