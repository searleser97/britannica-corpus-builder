Razor clam,   any of the species of marine bivalve mollusks of the family Solenidae. In England the species of the genera Ensis and Solen are called razor shells. The Solenidae are common in intertidal sands and muds, particularly of temperate seas. These bivalves have narrow and elongated razorlike shells up to about 20 cm (8 inches) long. They have a large active foot that enables them to move rapidly up and down within their burrows and retreat very quickly when disturbed. With their short siphons, they feed on particulate material in seawater. Some species are able to swim for short distances by jetting water through the siphons.
