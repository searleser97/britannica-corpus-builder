Carpet moth,  (genus Trichophaga),  any of several small, delicate moths in the order Lepidoptera that settle with their broad, patterned carpetlike wings (span 2–4 cm; 0.8–1.6 inch) outstretched and flattened against the resting surface. The moths develop from twiglike caterpillars or loopers. Certain species damage wool, whereas others are crop pests. Some carpet moths are active by night and some by day.
In North America, Trichophaga tapetzella is known as the carpet moth due to its feeding in wool carpet material.
