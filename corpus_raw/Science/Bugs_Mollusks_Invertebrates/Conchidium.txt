Conchidium,  genus of extinct brachiopods, or lamp shells, that is a valuable index fossil in marine rocks of the Lower and Middle Silurian (the Silurian Period lasted from 444 million to 416 million years ago). Both portions of the moderately large shell are strongly convex, and prominent linear ridges or markings, costae, are developed. Beaks may be present at the dorsal ends of the shell.
