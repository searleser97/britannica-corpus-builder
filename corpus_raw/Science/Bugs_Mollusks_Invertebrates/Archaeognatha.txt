Bristletail,  (order Archaeognatha),  any of approximately 350 species of primitive wingless insects that measure from 5 to 20 mm (0.2 to 0.8 inch) in length when they are fully grown and have three slender bristlelike appendages at the tip of the abdomen.
Bristletails have small compound eyes and external mouthparts. Some species have scales covering the body. Young bristletails resemble adults except in size. Sexual maturity is attained in two to three years, and the life span of some species may be as long as seven years. A bristletail molts as many as 35 times during its life (three to five times per year). Bristletails eat starchy material, often causing damage to books and papers.
Bristletails historically were placed in the order Thysanura, which has since been replaced by the orders Archaeognatha (also called Microcoryphia) and Zygentoma (silverfish and firebrats).
One of the oldest known insect fossils for which there is significant remaining structure (head and thorax fragments) is a bristletail, estimated to be 390 to 392 million years old. It was discovered on the north shore of Gaspé Bay, Quebec, Canada, at a site that was only 10° above the Equator during the Devonian time of this insect.
