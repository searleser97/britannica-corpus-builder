Ascaris,  any of a genus of worms (order Ascaridida, class Secernentea) that are parasitic in the intestines of various terrestrial mammals, chiefly herbivores. They are typically large worms (up to about 40 cm long) characterized by a mouth surrounded by three lips. The species Ascaris lumbricoides is probably the most familiar parasite in humans. More than 25 percent of the worldâ€™s human population is infected with these worms, and about 20,000 people die of Ascaris infestation yearly. An almost identical worm, often called A. suum, occurs in pigs. It is, however, not certain that this species is distinct from the one that infests humans. See ascariasis.
