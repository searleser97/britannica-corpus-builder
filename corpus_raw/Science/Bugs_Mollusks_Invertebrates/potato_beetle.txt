Potato beetle,   (Lema trilineata), one of the most destructive potato beetles until the advent of the Colorado potato beetle (q.v.) in the 1850s. The potato beetle belongs to the subfamily Criocerinae of the leaf beetle family Chrysomelidae (order Coleoptera). About 6 mm (less than 0.25 inch) long, it is yellow with three black stripes on its wing covers. Eggs are laid on the underside of a potato leaf, on which both larvae and adults feed. The larvae are camouflaged by the excrement the beetles pile on their backs. Two generations occur each year, the second of which spends the winter in the ground in the pupal stage.
