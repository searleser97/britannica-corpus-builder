Organ-pipe coral,   (genus Tubipora), any of a genus of marine animals of the class Anthozoa (phylum Cnidaria). The single known species, Tubipora musica, occurs on reefs in shallow waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans and is characterized by long, parallel upright polyps, or stalks, supported by a skeleton of rigid tubes of calcium carbonate. The tentacles of the polyps are sometimes green, and the skeleton is bright red or crimson. After the soft parts die, the skeleton remains as a brightly coloured mass of tubes that resemble organ pipes (hence the common name).
