Kinorhynch,   any of the approximately 150 species of microscopic marine invertebrates of the phylum Kinorhyncha, widely distributed in the world’s oceans. Kinorhynchs live mostly in the muddy bottoms of shallow seas and in the sand of seacoasts. They are rather bristly or spiny and are usually less than 1 mm (0.04 inch) long. The yellowish or brownish jointed body consists of 13 or 14 segments. The first segment is enlarged and bears a conspicuous crown of curved spines, or “scalids.” This segment is called the head and bears the creature’s mouth, which is encircled by a ring of piercing stylets. When at rest, a kinorhynch withdraws its head into the front end of its body. The alternate thrusting forward and withdrawing of the head produces a squirming movement by means of which the animal burrows through mud or sand. Kinorhynchs feed on diatoms, certain protozoans, and fine organic debris. Populations of two million individuals per square metre have been recorded from some samples of marine sediment. The sexes are separate, and there are no free-living larvae in the life cycle. Kinorhynchs were originally classified with nematodes, rotifers, and a number of other groups of small-bodied invertebrates in the now-abandoned phylum Aschelminthes.
