Gall midge,  (family Cecidomyiidae, or Itonididae),  any minute, delicate insect (order Diptera) characterized by beaded, somewhat hairy antennae and few veins in the short-haired wings. The brightly coloured larvae live in leaves and flowers, usually causing the formation of tissue swellings (galls). A few live in galls produced by other dipterans. Pupation takes place in the gall or in the soil; the winter is passed in an immature stage.
The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) is the most serious pest within the family. In Europe and North America the chrysanthemum midge (Diarthronomyia hypogaea) makes small galls in the leaves. The rose midge (Dasyneura rhodophaga) infests the young buds and shoots of roses and is a serious pest in greenhouses but rarely outside. Some other serious pests are the wheat midge, sorghum midge, rice midge, clover midge, and pear midge. Tobacco fumigation and dust on soil are used to control these insects.
A few beneficial species of gall midges prey on aphids, mites, scale insects, and bark beetle larvae. An interesting species of the genus Miastor exhibits an unusual method of reproduction called paedogenesis: large larvae produce smaller daughter larvae that remain inside the mother larva, feeding on it and eventually consuming it. The daughter larvae then escape and may reproduce in a similar manner for several generations before pupation takes place.
