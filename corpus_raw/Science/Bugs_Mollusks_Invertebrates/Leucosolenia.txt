Leucosolenia, also spelled Leucoselenia,  genus of tubular branched sponges of the class Calcispongiae (phylum Porifera). Found in tide pools and on wharves and represented by numerous species, the widespread genus includes most of the asconoids, structurally the simplest sponges.
Most species of Leucosolenia are 2.5 centimetres (one inch) or less in length. They grow as a colony of slender individuals connected by a common stolon—i.e., a rootlike process—which also attaches the group to the bottom or to some other surface. Water—which enters the central cavity (spongocoel) of the animal through numerous tiny perforations—is expelled through one large opening, the osculum, at the tip. The water current is created by flagella attached to choanocytes. Choanocytes are cells that line the spongocoel (that is, the central cavity of the sponge). The outer body wall consists of thin, flat cells called pinacocytes. Between the two cell layers is a jellylike matrix, the mesoglea, which usually contains freely moving cells (amoebocytes) and skeletal spicules often shaped like slender three- or four-pointed stars. The spicules, which provide support for the body tube, are produced by special amoebocytes.
New individuals usually develop as free-swimming flagellated larvae from eggs produced by amoebocytes. These larvae are released through the osculum of the parent. They eventually attach themselves permanently to new surfaces and metamorphose into tiny sponges. Some leucosolenids—for example, L. botryoides—also may reproduce by budding, a process in which a fingerlike extension of the parent body breaks off. The tip of the extension becomes the lower end of the new individual when it attaches to a new site.
