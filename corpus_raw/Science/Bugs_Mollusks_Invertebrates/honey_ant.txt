Honey ant,   any member of several different species of ant (family Formicidae; order Hymenoptera) that have developed a unique way of storing the honeydew, a by-product of digestion that is gathered mainly from the secretions of aphids and scale insects. A worker ant, fed by the others, is called a replete. The honeydew is stored in the repleteâ€™s abdomen, which can become distended to many times its normal size. The replete hangs from the ceiling of an underground chamber, sometimes for months, until the ant colony needs the stored food. After stimulation, the replete regurgitates the sweet honeydew.
The different honey ants apparently evolved this method of storage independent of each other. They include Melophorus, Leptomyrmex, Plagiolepis, Camponotus, Myrmecocystus, and Prenolepis. In some countries honey ants are considered a great delicacy; either the entire replete or only the golden-coloured abdomen may be eaten.
