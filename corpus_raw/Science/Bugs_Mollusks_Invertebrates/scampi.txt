Scampi, plural Scampi, also called Dublin Bay Prawn, orNorway Lobster,  (Nephrops norvegicus), edible lobster of the order Decapoda (class Crustacea). It is widespread in the Mediterranean and northeastern Atlantic, from North Africa to Norway and Iceland, and as a gastronomic delicacy it is commercially exploited over much of its range, particularly by Great Britain, France, Denmark, and Italy.
The scampi lives in burrows on soft sea bottoms at depths between 10 and 250 m (about 33 to 820 feet). It grows to about 200 mm (8 inches) in length and weighs about 200 g (0.44 pound). It is easily identified by its long, slender claws, which can be almost as long as the body. Most scampi are fished using a small trawl, but a few are caught in baited lobster pots. They are marketed in a variety of ways: whole or as tails, shelled or unshelled, fresh, frozen, or cooked. The term scampi is sometimes used loosely to refer to any large shrimp. See also lobster.
