Strepsipteran,  (order Strepsiptera),  any of about 600 species of small insects that are notable for their bizarre form of parasitism. Strepsipterans are parasitic in planthoppers, leafhoppers, treehoppers, froghoppers, bees, and other insects. Mature females are usually wingless and saclike, whereas the males have large, fanlike hindwings, short, clublike forewings, bulging eyes, and comblike antennae. The bristly and long-legged Stylops larvae are picked up from a flower by bees and transported to a bee nest, where they penetrate bee larvae and live as parasites first within the larva and later in the adult bee. The Stylops female remains permanently in the puparium formed from the last larval skin inside the host except for its head, which protrudes from the mature beeâ€™s abdomen. The male comes out of the host as a winged adult and locates and fertilizes the female through an opening in the puparium beneath her head. The young develop inside the female, emerge through the same opening, and are carried to a flower by the bee. Although bees so parasitized live an almost normal life span, their reproductive organs do not develop.
Some authorities classify these insects in the beetle family Meloidae.
