Feather-winged beetle,  (family Ptiliidae),  any of more than 400 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) characterized by long fringes of hair on the long, narrow hindwings. The antennae also have whorls of long hairs. Most feather-winged beetles are oval and between 0.25 and 1 mm (0.01 to 0.04 inch) in length, although some members of the family range up to 2 mm.
Feather-winged beetles live in rotting wood, fungi, manure, under bark, or in ant nests. Nanosella fungi, one of the smallest insects (about 0.25 mm long [0.01 in]), lives in the New World Tropics.
