Tabulata,  major division of extinct coral animals found as fossils in Ordovician to Jurassic marine rocks (488 million to 146 million years old). Tabulata is characterized by the presence of interior platforms, or tabulae, and by a general lack of vertical walls, or septa. Colonial masses of these tabulate corals sometimes comprised sizable structures.
