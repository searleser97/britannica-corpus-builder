Water spider,  (Argyroneta aquatica), also known as diving bell spider,  species of spider that is known for its underwater silk web, which resembles a kind of flexible diving bell. The water spider is the only species of spider known to spend its entire life underwater. It has been placed in the family Argyronetidae; however, studies of fossil spiders suggest that it may be more closely related to members of family Cybaeidae.
Water spiders are found in ponds, slow-moving streams, and other shallow bodies of fresh water, particularly where aquatic vegetation is abundant. They are distributed geographically across the northern and central regions of Europe and Siberia. Adult water spiders measure between 8 and 15 mm (0.3 and 0.6 inch) in length and typically are gray to dark brown in colour. Their legs and abdomens are covered with fine hairs, which trap air bubbles in the water and give the spiders a shimmering, silvery appearance.
Once a water spider has captured tiny bubbles of air in the hairs on its body at the water’s surface, it transports them to its silk web, which is anchored to underwater plants or other objects, and ejects them into the interior, thereby inflating the underwater house with air. Research has shown that the inflated web serves as a sort of gill, extracting dissolved oxygen from the water when oxygen concentrations inside the web become sufficiently low to draw oxygen in from the water. Slowly, however, the inflated web collapses, and the spider must travel to the water’s surface for bubble renewal, which it does about once each day.
Most of the life cycle of the water spider, including courtship and breeding, prey capture and feeding, and the development of eggs and embryos, occurs below the water’s surface. Many of these activities take place within the spider’s diving bell.
Water spiders, which tend to be more active at night than during the day, are carnivorous and prey on aquatic invertebrates, such as water mites, water boatmen, and phantom midge larvae. Males generally are more aggressive hunters than females.
Male water spiders often construct their webs close to those of females and tunnel into the females’ webs to mate. A female may lay between 30 and 70 eggs, which are secured within a cocoon suspended from the upper region of the female’s web. Eggs hatch within several weeks, and the spiderlings disperse into the water. Young water spiders often make use of empty snail shells and similar habitats, which they fill with air, before constructing their own webs.
