Seed beetle,  (subfamily Bruchinae), also called bean weevil,  any of some 1,350 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) whose larvae live in and feed on dried seeds. Seed beetles are oval or egg shaped, 1 to 10 mm (up to 2/5 inch) in length, and black or brown in colour. In adults the abdomen extends beyond the short forewings (elytra) and the head is extended into a broad, short snout. The life cycle is typified by the pea weevil (Bruchus pisorum) and the bean weevil (Acanthoscelides obtectus), both of which occur throughout the world.
The pea weevil is dark brown, about 5 mm (1/5 inch) long, and has white markings on its elytra. The female deposits her eggs on young pea pods, and the larvae bore through the pod and into the peas. Pea seeds that float when placed in a bowl of water are infested.
The bean weevil, unlike the pea weevil, deposits eggs on dry seeds and will produce several clutches of eggs. It resembles the pea weevil but lacks the white markings on the elytra.
