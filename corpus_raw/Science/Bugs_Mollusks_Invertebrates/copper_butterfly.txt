Copper butterfly,  (subfamily Lycaeninae),  any member of a group of butterflies in the gossamer-winged butterfly family, Lycaenidae (order Lepidoptera). The copper’s typical coloration ranges from orange-red to brown, usually with a copper tinge and dark markings.
The American copper (Lycaena phleas) is the most common species in North America. Its larvae feed on clover, dock, or sorrel. Adults are delicate, with an 18- to 38-mm (0.75- to 1.5-inch) wingspan. They are rapid fliers and are usually distinguished by iridescent wings. The male’s forelegs are reduced, but the female’s are fully developed.
The bronze copper butterfly (L. hyllus) is found in southern Canada and throughout most of the United States. Adults typically have a wingspan of about 3.2 to 4.8 cm (1.3 to 1.9 inches). Male and female bronze coppers are distinguished from other coppers by the gray-white undersides of their hind wings, which have an orange margin and are marked by black spots.
