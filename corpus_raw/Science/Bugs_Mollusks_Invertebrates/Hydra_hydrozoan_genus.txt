Hydra,   genus of invertebrate freshwater animals of the class Hydrozoa (phylum Cnidaria). The body of such an organism consists of a thin, usually translucent tube that measures up to about 30 millimetres (1.2 inches) long but is capable of great contraction. The body wall is comprised of two layers of cells separated by a thin, structureless layer of connective tissue called the mesoglea and the enteron, a cavity containing intestinal organs. The lower end of the body is closed, and an opening at the upper end both ingests food and ejects residue. Around this opening is a circlet of 4 to about 25 tentacles.
Eggs and sperm appear in separate swellings (gonads) in the outer body layer, and individuals usually have separate sexes. Some species, however, are hermaphroditic (i.e., functional reproductive organs of both sexes occur in the same individual). Eggs are retained in the ovaries and fertilized by sperm from neighbouring individuals. Offspring are eventually released as miniature hydras. Vegetative reproduction by budding is also common. Finger-shaped outpushings of the wall develop mouth and tentacles and finally nip off at the base, forming separate new individuals. Locomotion is by creeping on the adhesive base, or by looping; i.e., tentacles attach to the substrate, the base releases, and the whole body somersaults, enabling the base to attach in a new position.
The genus is represented by about 25 species, which differ chiefly in colour, tentacle length and number, and gonad position and size. All Hydra species feed on other small invertebrate animals such as crustaceans. Hydra is an unusual hydrozoan genus in that its life cycle lacks any trace of a jellyfish stage, and the polyp stage is solitary rather than colonial.
