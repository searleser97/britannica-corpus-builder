Firebrat,  (Thermobia domestica),  stout-bodied quick-moving wingless insect. The firebrat is worldwide in distribution and is commonly found indoors, typically lingering in warm locations, such as near fireplaces, furnaces, and water heaters. It feeds on starches and thus can cause damage to books, fabrics, and stored foods.
The firebrat typically is white with light and dark spots. Its body is oblong; adults are roughly 10 mm (0.39 inch) in length. The life cycle and habits of the firebrat are similar to those of the silverfish (Lepisma saccharina). Both species are members of order Zygentoma.
Insecticides can be used to control firebrat populations.
