Streptelasma,  extinct genus of corals, existing as single animals rather than colonial forms and found as fossils in marine rocks of Ordovician to Devonian age (488 million to 359 million years old). Each horn-shaped specimen represents a single individual. The hard, and thus preserved, parts of the animal consist of a carbonate skeletal structure distinctive in form and construction.
