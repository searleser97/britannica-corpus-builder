Pseudoschwagerina,   extinct genus of fusulinid foraminiferans (single-celled animals with hard shells preservable as fossils) found as fossils in Early Permian marine rocks (286 to 258 million years ago). The shell is spherical with localized thickening as a sort of lip. In thin section, the shell structure consists of widely spaced inner walls and distinctive wall deposits. Pseudoschwagerina is a guide, or index, fossil for the Wolfcampian Stage, a division of Permian rocks.
