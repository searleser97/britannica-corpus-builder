Boxhole Meteorite Crater,   meteorite crater formed in alluvium near Boxhole Homestead, Northern Territory, central Australia. It is situated 155 miles (250 km) northeast of the Henbury meteorite craters. The bowl-shaped crater, discovered in 1937, is 583 feet (178 m) in diameter and 53 feet (16 m) deep. Numerous nickelâ€“iron fragments have been found in the area. Because of its size, the crater is thought to have resulted from the explosion of a meteorite on impact, although no fused silica glass has been found at the site.
