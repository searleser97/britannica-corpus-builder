Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d’Anville,  (born July 11, 1697, Paris, France—died Jan. 28, 1782, Paris), French geographer and cartographer who greatly improved the standards of map-making.
From an early age d’Anville continued the reform of French cartography begun by Guillaume Delisle, but he was also a reputable classical scholar, and many of his memoirs and maps relate to ancient and medieval geography. He displayed exceptional judgment in his choice and use of past authorities and a detailed knowledge of measures of distance, and he adjusted his measurements where possible to astronomically determined positions. His first important map was that of China, prepared from the surveys of the Jesuits. First issued in 1735, it later was published as the Nouvel atlas de la Chine (“New Atlas of China”) in 1737. His map of Italy (1743) corrected numerous errors in the accepted maps of that country. Other important maps were of Africa (1749), Asia (1751), India (1752), and the world in hemispheres (1761). From the contemporary map of Africa, d’Anville removed many of the conventional and largely fictitious features of the interior, and his representation stood until the great explorations of the 19th century. His Atlas général, first published in 1743, was frequently revised. D’Anville was appointed first geographer to the king of France in 1773.
