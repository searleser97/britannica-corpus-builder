Anglesite,   naturally occurring lead sulfate (PbSO4). A common secondary mineral that is a minor ore of lead, it is usually formed by the oxidation of galena and often forms a concentrically banded mass surrounding a core of unaltered galena. The formation of cerussite (lead carbonate) often accompanies or follows the formation of anglesite. For detailed physical properties, see sulfate mineral (table).
