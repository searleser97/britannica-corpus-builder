Captorhinus,  genus of extinct reptiles found as fossils in Permian rocks of North America (the Permian Period lasted from 299 million to 251 million years ago). Captorhinus was small with slender limbs; its full length was about 30 cm (12 inches), and its skull was only about 7 cm (2.75 inches) long. It bore some resemblance to a modern lizard. Captorhinus was one of the earliest and most primitive reptiles. In form it was representative of the captorhinomorphs, a group of early reptiles with nearly solid skulls that had no openings for the attachment of jaw muscles. The captorhinomorphs were eventually succeeded by reptiles with more advanced skulls and stronger jaws for biting and chewing food. Only one small group of captorhinomorphs persisted into the Triassic Period (251 million to 200 million years ago) before becoming extinct.
