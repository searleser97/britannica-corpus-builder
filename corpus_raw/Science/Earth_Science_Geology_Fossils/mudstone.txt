Mudstone,  sedimentary rock composed primarily of clay- or silt-sized particles (less than 0.063 mm [0.0025 inch] in diameter); it is not laminated or easily split into thin layers. Some geologists designate as mudstone any similar rock that is blocky or massive; others, however, prefer a broader definition that includes all of the members of the shale group. See also siltstone.
