Lahar,   mudflow of volcanic material. Lahars may carry all sizes of material from ash to large boulders and produce deposits of volcanic conglomerate. Lahars may be the result of heavy rain on loose ash material such as deposits of nu√©es ardentes (dense clouds of gases charged with incandescent dust, discharging volcanic sand in avalanche fashion); or they may result from the mixing of debris with river water, the flooding of ash by snow or ice melted by an eruption, or the emptying of crater lakes onto loose material. A variation is the hot lahar ordinarily produced by the heating of the crater lake water by the quiet upwelling of lava or an explosion. Lahars move downslope at very high speeds and may extend for tens of miles. A lahar deposit usually has a hummocky or hilly surface. They often cause much death and destruction, as at Herculaneum during the eruption of Vesuvius in ad 79.
