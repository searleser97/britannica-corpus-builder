Nickel–iron,  very rare native alloy of nickel and iron that contains between 24 and 77 percent nickel. It occurs in the gold washings of the Gorge River, N.Z.; in the platinum sands of the Bobrovka River, Urals; and in the gold dredgings of the Fraser River, B.C. It also occurs in large ellipsoidal masses (some weighing more than 40 kilograms [about 90 pounds]) in Oregon.
Nickel–iron also can be of meteoritic origin. Called taenite, it is found in some ataxites and in all octahedrites. Plessite, an intergrowth of taenite and kamacite (meteoritic iron), is also a constituent of all octahedrites. All the nickel–irons crystallize in the isometric system. For detailed physical properties, see native element (table).
