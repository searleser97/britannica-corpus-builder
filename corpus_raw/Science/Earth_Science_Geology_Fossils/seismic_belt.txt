Seismic belt,  narrow geographic zone on the Earthâ€™s surface along which most earthquake activity occurs. The outermost layer of the Earth (lithosphere) is made up of several large tectonic plates. The edges where these plates move against one another are the location of interplate earthquakes that produce the seismic belts. Island arcs, mountain chains, volcanism, deep ocean troughs, and oceanic ridges are often features of seismic belts. The two major seismic belts are the Circum-Pacific Belt, which surrounds the Pacific Ocean, and the Alpide Belt, which stretches from the Azores through the Mediterranean and Middle East to the Himalayas and Indonesia, where it joins the Circum-Pacific Belt. A purely oceanic seismic belt lies along the mid-Atlantic ridge.
