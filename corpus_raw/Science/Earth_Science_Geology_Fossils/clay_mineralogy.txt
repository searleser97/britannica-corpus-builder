Clay mineralogy,   the scientific discipline concerned with all aspects of clay minerals, including their properties, composition, classification, crystal structure, and occurrence and distribution in nature. The methods of study include X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopic analysis, chemical analyses of bulk and monomineralic samples, determinations of cationic exchange capacities, electron-optical studies, thermal studies by differential thermal analysis, and thermo-gravimetric methods. The singular character of these hydrous silicate minerals and the nature of the problems surrounding them justify the status of clay mineralogy as a discipline distinct from mineralogy. A common body of knowledge is involved, however, particularly with regard to studies of internal structure.
