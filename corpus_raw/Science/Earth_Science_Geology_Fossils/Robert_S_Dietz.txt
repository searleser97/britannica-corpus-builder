Robert S. Dietz, in full Robert Sinclair Dietz,  (born Sept. 14, 1914, Westfield, N.J., U.S.—died  May 19, 1995, Tempe, Ariz.), American geophysicist and oceanographer who set forth a theory of seafloor spreading in 1961.
Dietz was educated at the University of Illinois (B.S., 1937; M.S., 1939; Ph.D., 1941). After serving as an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, he became a civilian scientist with the U.S. Navy. In this capacity, he supervised the oceanographic research on Admiral Richard E. Byrd’s last Antarctic expedition (1946–47). He subsequently served as oceanographer with several organizations, including the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (1958–65) and the Atlantic Oceanography and Meteorology Laboratories (1970–77). He became professor of geology at Arizona State University, Tempe, in 1977.
Dietz’s discovery in 1952 of the first fracture zone in the Pacific, which he related to deformation of the Earth’s crust, led him to hypothesize that new crustal material is formed at oceanic ridges and spreads outward at a rate of several centimetres per year. Subsequent work confirmed this suggestion. He helped to redevelop the bathyscaphe Trieste of Swiss engineer Jacques Piccard, who descended about 7 miles (11 km) into the Pacific Ocean in it in 1960. Dietz also became known for his work in the fields of selenography (study of the Moon’s physical features) and meteoritics, particularly for his suggestion that certain shock effects in rocks are indicative of meteorite impact.
