Ripple mark,   one of a series of small marine, lake, or riverine topographic features, consisting of repeating wavelike forms with symmetrical slopes, sharp peaks, and rounded troughs. Ripple marks are formed in sandy bottoms by oscillation waves, in which only the wave form advances rapidly, the actual water-particle motion consisting of almost closed vertical orbits that migrate landward only very slowly. The orbital motion at the surface is communicated downward with diminishing strength; but if the water depth is less than about one-half of the wave length, water motion is still significant near the bottom. The presence of the bottom restricts the lowermost orbits into nearly flat ellipses, however, and the bottom water moves rhythmically to and fro. If the maximum horizontal velocity of this motion is capable of moving the grains composing the bed, ripple marks develop. Any minor prominence on the bottom determines the position of alternate vortices on either side, and a sharp ridge with symmetrical slopes eventually forms. The crestal spacing of a ripple train is equal in length to the average length of oscillatory paths near the bed.
