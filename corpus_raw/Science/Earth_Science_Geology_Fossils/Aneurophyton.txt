Aneurophyton,  genus of extinct plants that lived during the Middle and Late Devonian epochs (about 398 to 359 million years ago) and is commonly considered a basal member of the progymnosperms—the probable ancestors of seed plants. The progymnosperms also included Archaeopteris, which was probably the first true tree; however, Aneurophyton had a basic structural design similar to earlier Devonian plants such as Psilophyton and Pertica. Aneurophyton had an upright nonwoody stem with lateral branches arranged in a loose spiral. The branches divided up to three times, and some bore terminal clusters of sporangia. Other branches were specialized for photosynthesis, but tissue had not yet filled in the spaces between branches to form a true leaf. This structural design likely gave rise to ferns, horsetail relatives, and seed plants—the major plant lineages of the Paleozoic Era (542 to 251 million years ago).
