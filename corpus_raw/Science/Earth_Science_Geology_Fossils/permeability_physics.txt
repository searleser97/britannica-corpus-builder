Permeability,   capacity of a porous material for transmitting a fluid; it is expressed as the velocity with which a fluid of specified viscosity, under the influence of a given pressure, passes through a sample having a certain cross section and thickness. Permeability is largely dependent on the size and shape of the pores in the substance and, in granular materials such as sedimentary rocks, by the size, shape, and packing arrangement of the grains.
The standard unit of permeability is the darcy, equivalent to the passage of one cubic centimetre of fluid (having a viscosity of one centipoise) per second through a sample one square centimetre in cross-sectional area under a pressure of one atmosphere per centimetre of thickness.
