Friedrich Adolf Paneth,  (born Aug. 31, 1887, Vienna, Austria—died  Sept. 17, 1958, Vienna), Austrian chemist who with George Charles de Hevesy introduced radioactive tracer techniques (1912–13).
Paneth, the son of noted physiologist Joseph Paneth, studied at Munich, Glasgow, and Vienna, then held positions at the Radium Institute, Vienna, and at research facilities in Prague, Hamburg, Berlin, and Königsberg. Upon the rise of the Nazi movement, he went to England and took a position as guest lecturer at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London (1933–38), and then became professor of chemistry at the University of Durham (1939). In 1953 he returned to West Germany as director of the Max Planck Institute at Mainz.
Between 1918 and 1922 Paneth prepared hydrides of bismuth, lead, and polonium with radioactive isotopes. Beginning in 1929 he furnished proof of the brief existence of the methyl and ethyl free radicals. His microanalytical work in rare gases led him to study the composition of the atmosphere and to conclude that the composition of air is constant at least to an altitude of approximately 61 km (38 miles). His measurement of helium from the radioactive decomposition of meteorites and terrestrial rocks led to methods for ascertaining their age.
