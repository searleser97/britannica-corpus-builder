Calomel (Hg2Cl2), also called mercurous chloride or mercury(I) chloride,  a very heavy, soft, white, odourless, and tasteless halide mineral formed by the alteration of other mercury minerals, such as cinnabar or amalgams. Calomel is found together with native mercury, cinnabar, calcite, limonite, and clay at Moschellandsberg, Germany; Zimap√°n, Mexico; and Brewster county, Texas, U.S. For detailed physical properties, see halide mineral (table).
Once the most popular of cathartics, calomel has been used in medicine since the 16th century. The recognition of its potential toxicity (because of disassociation into mercury and mercuric chloride), together with the development of superior and safer cathartics, led to a decline in its use in internal medicine. It has found application in certain insecticides and fungicides, however. The compound is also used in the construction of calomel electrodes for potentiometric titration (a chemical technique designed to measure the  potential between two electrical conductors in a medium such as an electrolyte solution).
