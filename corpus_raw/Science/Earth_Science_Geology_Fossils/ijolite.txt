Ijolite,  intrusive igneous rock that is composed essentially of nepheline and an alkali pyroxene, usually aegirine-augite. It is the plutonic equivalent of the volcanic nephelinites. Typically, the pyroxene is well-crystallized and is surrounded by the nepheline. Accessory minerals include garnet, titanite, perovskite, apatite, cancrinite, and calcite.
Ijolites form characteristic members of carbonatiteâ€“alkali igneous complexes, such as those of Alno, Swed.; Fen, Nor.; Kola Peninsula, Russia, where they contain abundant wollastonite; and Iron Hill, Colo., U.S. The ijolites of Magnet Cove, Ark., U.S.; Ice River, B.C., Can.; and Sekukuniland, Transvaal, S. Afr., are among the better-known representatives found in rock collections. The rocks known as urtite (Kola Peninsula) and melteigite (near Fen, Nor.) are essentially similar assemblages; in the former, nepheline largely predominates, whereas the latter is a variant with an excessive proportion of pyroxene.
