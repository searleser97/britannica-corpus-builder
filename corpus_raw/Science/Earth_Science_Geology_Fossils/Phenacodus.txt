Phenacodus,  extinct genus of mammals known from fossils of the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs of North America and Europe. Phenacodus is representative of early ungulates, or hoofed mammals. It had five toes and a digitigrade stance like that of a dog, with many specializations for running. The structure and dentition of Phenacodus suggest that it was fairly omnivorous. Although the canine teeth were large and well developed, the cheek teeth were at least partly adapted to eating plants.
