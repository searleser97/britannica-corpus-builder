George Engelmann,  (born Feb. 2, 1809, Frankfurt am Main—died  Feb. 4, 1884, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.), U.S. botanist, physician, and meteorologist who is known primarily for his botanical monographs, especially one on the cactus and also A Monography of North American Cuscutinae (1842).
Engelmann studied at the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin and received his M.D. degree from the University of Würzburg in 1831. His illustrated thesis, De Antholysi Prodromus, was an important study of the morphology of monstrosities. He went to the United States in 1833, and in 1835 he settled in St. Louis, where he became a leading physician. Continuing his studies in biology, he pointed out the adaptation of the pronuba moth for pollinating yuccas and made the economically important discovery of the immunity of the North American grape to the plant lice Phylloxera. His systematic meteorological observations, begun in 1836, were a pioneering effort that he continued until his death. Much of his work was assembled in The Botanical Works of the Late George Engelmann Collected for Henry Shaw (1887).
