Tropical monsoon and trade-wind littoral climate,  major climate type of the Köppen classification characterized by small annual temperature ranges, high temperatures, and plentiful precipitation (often more than wet equatorial, or Af, climates in annual total). Despite their resemblance to wet equatorial climates, tropical monsoon and trade-wind littoral climates exhibit a short dry season, usually in the low-sun (“winter”) season, and the highest temperatures generally occur at the end of this clear spell. These climates are found primarily in southern and southeastern Asia and have the combined abbreviation Am in the Köppen-Geiger-Pohl system.
Two distinct processes can give rise to Am climate types. The largest areas, mostly in southern and southeastern Asia, result from the Asian monsoon circulation that brings convective and orographic precipitation in the summer when warm, moist, maritime tropical air moves over land to converge into the low-pressure zone north of the Himalayas. In winter, by contrast, cool, dry air diverges out of the Siberian anticyclone to the north, bringing a cooler, drier, and clearer period of variable length.
In the Americas and in Africa, Am climates are of the trade-wind variety. These areas receive precipitation on narrow coastal strips through orographic effects as the moist air of the trade winds ascends mountain chains. Seasonal migrations and changes in the intensity of these winds give rise to short, moderately dry seasons. Summer precipitation may be enhanced by tropical disturbances traveling in the trade winds.
