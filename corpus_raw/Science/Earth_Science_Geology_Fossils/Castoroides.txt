Castoroides,  extinct genus of giant beavers found as fossils in Pleistocene deposits in North America (the Pleistocene Epoch began 2.6 million years ago and ended 11,700 years ago). Castoroides attained a length of about 2.5 metres (7.5 feet). The skull was large and the gnawing teeth strongly developed. In Europe a similar form of giant beaver, Trogontherium, paralleled the development of Castoroides.
