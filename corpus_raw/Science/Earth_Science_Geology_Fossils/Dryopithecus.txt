Dryopithecus,  genus of extinct ape that is representative of early members of the lineage that includes humans and other apes. Although Dryopithecus has been known by a variety of names based upon fragmentary material found over a widespread area including Europe, Africa, and Asia, it appears probable that only a single genus is represented. Dryopithecus is found as fossils in Miocene and Pliocene deposits (23 to 2.6 million years old) and apparently originated in Africa.
Several distinct forms of Dryopithecus are known, including small, medium, and large, gorilla-sized animals. In many ways, as might be expected, Dryopithecus is rather generalized in structure and lacks most of the specializations that distinguish living humans and other living apes. The canine teeth are larger than those in humans but not as strongly developed as those in other living apes. The limbs were not excessively long. The skull lacked the well-developed crests and massive brow ridges found in modern apes.
Dryopithecus was a distant Miocene forerunner of gorillas and chimpanzees. A form close to this branching of the dryopithecine stock is represented by the genus Ramapithecus, distinguished by its more advanced dentition. The dryopithecines probably inhabited forested areas.
