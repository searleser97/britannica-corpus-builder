geomagnetic storm of 1859, also called Carrington storm,  largest geomagnetic storm ever recorded. The storm, which occurred on Sept. 2, 1859, produced intense auroral displays  as far south as the tropics. It also caused fires as the enhanced electric current flowing through telegraph wires ignited recording tape at telegraph stations. On the previous day, British astronomer Richard Carrington of the Royal Greenwich Observatory had made the first observations of a white-light solar flare, a bright spot suddenly appearing on the Sun. Carrington noted the coincidence (but did not claim a direct connection) between the geomagnetic storm and the solar flare, thus prefiguring the discipline of space weather research.
It is now thought that the active region on the Sun that produced the white-light flare also produced a fast coronal mass ejection (CME), a large eruption of magnetized plasma that subsequently produced the geomagnetic storm. Although CMEs are often associated with solar flares, the two can occur independently.
