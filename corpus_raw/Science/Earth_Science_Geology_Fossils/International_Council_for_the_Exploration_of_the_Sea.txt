International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES),  international organization that promotes marine research in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea. Established in 1902, the ICES originally included as members Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The council later added Belgium, Canada, Estonia, France, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the United States. Australia, Chile, Greece, New Zealand, Peru, and South Africa have also participated in the organization to some extent. ICES is headquartered in Copenhagen.
Originally created as a forum to discuss aspects of marine research, the ICES evolved into a leading collector of marine information, bringing together scientific experts from a broad range of specialties. More than 1,600 scientists from all areas of the world participate in committees and research groups, which share their findings in ICES meetings, especially the ICES Annual Science Conference. In addition to research in oceanography and marine biology, the ICES studies marine-related industries. Major areas of research include sustainable fishing practices, improved fisheries management, and habitat protection. The ICES serves as a scientific adviser for a number of international commissions as well as for the governments of its member countries.
The ICES distributes information through various journals and other publications, including the ICES Journal of Marine Science. The journal features not only scientific findings but also economic, social, and public-administration studies.
