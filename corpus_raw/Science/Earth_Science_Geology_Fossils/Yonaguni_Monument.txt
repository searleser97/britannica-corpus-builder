Yonaguni Monument,  underwater rock structure that was discovered in the mid-1980s near Yonaguni Island, Japan. While some believe the ziggurat-like formation is from an ancient city, others argue that it was naturally created.
The rectangular monument, which was first detected by a scuba diver, is more than 165 feet (50 metres) long and some 65 feet (20 metres) wide. A number of scholars have visited the site, but its origin remains uncertain. According to some, the monument is a man-made stepped pyramid. In addition to many straight lines, some of the rocks purportedly have carvings. Nearby are other formations, suggesting a submerged ancient city. This theory contends that the structures are at least 5,000 years old and belong to a lost civilizationâ€”possibly the legendary Mu or Lemuria.
Other researchers, however, claim that the monument is natural, shaped over the years by underwater currents. They state that the symmetry of the rocks is not as pronounced as reported and that the structure appears to be made out of solid rock rather than distinct blocks, which would suggest human activity. Furthermore, they argue that the alleged carvings are naturally occurring scratches.
