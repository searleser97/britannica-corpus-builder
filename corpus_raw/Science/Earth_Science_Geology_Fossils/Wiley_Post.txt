Wiley Post,  (born November 22, 1898, near Grand Saline, Texas, U.S.—died August 15, 1935, near Point Barrow, Alaska), one of the most colourful figures of the early years of American aviation, who set many records, including the first solo flight around the world.
Post, accompanied by navigator Harold Gatty, made his first around-the-world flight from June 23 to July 1, 1931, in a Lockheed Vega named Winnie Mae (now part of the Smithsonian Institution’s collection), completing the voyage in 8 days, 15 hours, 51 minutes; later that year their account of the trip was published as Around the World in Eight Days. Two years later, again piloting the Winnie Mae, Post achieved his solo record, covering a total of 15,596 miles (25,099 km) in 7 days, 18  hours, 49 minutes, from July  15 to July 22, 1933. On this flight he proved the value of navigational instruments, including the automatic pilot. He later went on to establish altitude records, wearing a pressure suit of his own design to survive the high-altitude conditions.
In 1935 Post and humorist Will Rogers, his passenger, were killed when Post’s aircraft crashed in Alaska.
