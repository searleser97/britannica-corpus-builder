James Hall,  (born Sept. 12, 1811, Hingham, Mass., U.S.—died  Aug. 7, 1898, Bethlehem, N.H.), American geologist and paleontologist who was a major contributor to the geosynclinal theory of mountain building. According to this theory, sediment buildup in a shallow basin causes the basin to sink, thus forcing the neighbouring area to rise. His detailed studies established the stratigraphy of eastern North America.
Even as a student, Hall spent his summers and limited finances doing fieldwork, including the collection and identification of more than 900 species of plants. He became an assistant professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rensselaer, N.Y., in 1832 and later professor of chemistry, natural science, and geology.
In 1836 he was appointed state geologist for the Geological Survey of New York. Assigned to the western district, he conducted studies that culminated in his massive report Geology of New York (part 4, 1843), a classic in American geology. Although he could not explain the uplift of the sedimentary beds that formed the Appalachians, his observations were instrumental in forming the geosynclinal theory.
Hall became director of the Museum of Natural History, Albany, N.Y., in 1871. His 13-volume The Palaeontology of New York (1847–94) contained the results of his exhaustive studies of the Silurian and Devonian (approximately 360 million to 415 million years old) fossils found in New York.
He was state geologist of Iowa from 1855 to 1858 and of Wisconsin from 1857 to 1860. His publications included more than 260 scientific papers and 35 books dealing with numerous phases of the geology and paleontology of the United States and Canada. He was a charter member of the National Academy of Sciences.
