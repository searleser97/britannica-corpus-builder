Cordaitales,  an order of coniferophytes (phylum, sometimes division, Coniferophyta), fossil plants dominant during the Carboniferous Period (359 million to 299 million years ago) directly related to the conifers (order Coniferales). Many were trees up to 30 metres (100 feet) tall, branched, and crowned with large, leathery, strap-shaped leaves. Three families are included—Pityaceae, Poroxylaceae, and Cordaitaceae—of which the Cordaitaceae is the best known. Its genera Cordaites and Cordaianthus are represented by fossil leaves, branches, and loosely formed cones, investigations of which have led to the formulation of the cordaite-conifer evolutionary sequence through the primitive conifer family Lebachiaceae (see Lebachia). The Pityaceae, from the Early Carboniferous, and the Poroxylaceae, geologically later but more primitive in wood structure, are closer in many respects to the seed ferns (pteridosperms). They are provisionally grouped with the Cordaitales until evidence displaces them.
