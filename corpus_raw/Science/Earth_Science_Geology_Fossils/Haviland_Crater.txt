Haviland Crater, also called Brenham Crater,  small, shallow impact crater in farmland near Haviland, Kiowa county, Kansas, U.S. The depression, some 50 feet (15 metres) in diameter, is oval in shape. The first meteorite fragment, now known to be of the strong-iron, or pallasite, type, was found at the site in 1885, but the shallow crater was not identified until 1925 (it is one of the smallest impact craters in the world). Meteoritic fragments, including one weighing some 1,100 pounds (500 kg), are spread over an area of several square miles. This is thought to indicate that several small meteorites fell in the area.
