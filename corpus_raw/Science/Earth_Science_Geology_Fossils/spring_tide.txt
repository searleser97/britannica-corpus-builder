Spring tide,  tide of maximal range, near the time of new and full moon when the Sun and Moon are in syzygyâ€”i.e., aligned with the Earth. Conjunction is the time during new moon when the Sun and Moon lie on the same side of the Earth. The other syzygy condition, opposition, occurs during full moon when the Sun and Moon are positioned on opposite sides of the Earth. In either case of syzygy, the tide-producing forces of the Sun and the Moon reinforce each other, and the tidal amplitudes on Earth are at their greatest. See tide.
