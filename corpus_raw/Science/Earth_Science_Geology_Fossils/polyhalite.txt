Polyhalite,  a sulfate mineral in evaporite deposits [K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4·2H2O] that often occurs with anhydrite and halite. Its name, from the Greek words meaning “many salts,” reflects its composition, hydrated sulfates of potassium, calcium, and magnesium. It makes up 7 percent of the rock in the salt deposits at Stassfurt, Ger., and is also abundant in the salt deposits of the Saratov region of Russia, where certain beds consist of 85 percent polyhalite. The Texas–New Mexico potash region is another noteworthy locality. For detailed physical properties, see sulfate mineral (table).
