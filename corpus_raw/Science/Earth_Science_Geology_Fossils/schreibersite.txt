Schreibersite,  mineral consisting of iron nickel phosphide [(Fe,Ni)3P] that is present in most meteorites containing nickel-iron metal. In iron meteorites, it often is found in the form of plates and as shells around nodules of troilite (an iron sulfide mineral). Rodlike schreibersite is called rhabdite and was once thought to be a separate mineral. The crystals of both varieties belong to the tetragonal system. For detailed physical properties, see native element (table).
