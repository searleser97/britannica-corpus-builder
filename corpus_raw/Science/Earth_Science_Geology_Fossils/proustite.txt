Proustite,   a sulfosalt mineral, silver arsenic sulfide (Ag3AsS3), that is an important source of silver. Sometimes called ruby silver because of its scarlet-vermilion colour, it occurs in the upper portions of most silver veins, where it is less common than pyrargyrite. Large, magnificent crystals, of hexagonal symmetry, have been found at Cha√±arcillo, Chile; other notable localities are Lorrain, Ont., and Freiberg and Marienberg, Ger. It is mined as a silver ore in Mexico and is found in small amounts in the silver mines of the western United States. For detailed physical properties, see sulfosalt (table).
