Horse latitude,  either of two subtropical atmospheric high-pressure belts that encircle Earth around latitudes 30°–35° N and 30°–35° S and that generate light winds and clear skies. Because they contain dry subsiding air, they produce arid climates in the areas below them. The Sahara, for example, is situated in a horse latitude. The Southern Hemisphere, which has more water area than the Northern, has the more continuous belt of subsiding air. The belts contain several separate high-pressure centres and shift a few degrees away from the Equator in summer. The belt nearest the Tropic of Cancer is known as the calms of Cancer, while the belt nearest the Tropic of Capricorn is known as the calms of Capricorn.
The horse latitudes were named by the crews of sailing ships, who sometimes threw horses overboard to conserve water when their ships were becalmed in the high-pressure belts.
