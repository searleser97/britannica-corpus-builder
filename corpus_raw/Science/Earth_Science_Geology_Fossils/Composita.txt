Composita,  genus of extinct brachiopods, or lamp shells, found as fossils in marine rocks of the Carboniferous to Permian periods (from 359 million to 251 million years ago). Composita is abundant and widespread as a fossil, especially in Permian deposits. The shell is smooth, small, and distinctive in form; a fold and sulcus (groove) are present in the valves, and the pedicle opening (for the anchoring foot) is round.
