J. Tuzo Wilson, in full John Tuzo Wilson,  (born Oct. 24, 1908, Ottawa, Ont., Can.—died  April 15, 1993, Toronto, Ont.), Canadian geologist and geophysicist who established global patterns of faulting and the structure of the continents. His studies in plate tectonics had an important bearing on the theories of continental drift, seafloor spreading, and convection currents within the Earth.
The son of a Scottish engineer who had immigrated to Canada, Wilson in 1930 became the first person at any Canadian university to graduate in geophysical studies (B.A., Trinity College, University of Toronto). He then studied at St. John’s College, Cambridge (B.A., 1932), Princeton University (Ph.D., 1936), and Cambridge University (M.A., 1940; Sc.D., 1958). He worked with the Geological Survey of Canada (1936–39) and served with the Royal Canadian Engineers during World War II, rising to the rank of colonel. After the war, in 1946, Wilson became professor of geophysics at the University of Toronto, where he remained until 1974, when he became director general of the Ontario Science Centre. From 1983 to 1986 he was chancellor of York University. He was president of both the Royal Society of Canada (1972–73) and the American Geophysical Union (1980–82). Among his major publications were One Chinese Moon (1959), IGY: Year of the New Moons (1961), A Revolution in Earth Science (1967), and Continents Adrift and Continents Aground (1977).
In the early 1960s Wilson became the world’s leading spokesman for the revived theory of continental drift, at a time when prevailing opinion held that continents were fixed and immovable. His paper entitled A New Class of Faults and Their Bearing on Continental Drift (1965) introduced the concept of the transform fault. Whereas previous theories of continental drift had conceived of plates as either moving closer together (convergent plates) or further apart (divergent), Wilson asserted that a third kind of movement existed whereby plates slide past each other. This theory became one of the bases for plate tectonics, which revolutionized the geophysical sciences in the 1970s. A range of mountains in Antarctica is named for him.
