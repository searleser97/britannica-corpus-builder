Protonosphere,   region in the Earth’s upper atmosphere where atomic hydrogen and protons (ionic hydrogen) are the dominant constituents; it can be considered the outermost extension of the ionosphere. In the lowest part of the Earth’s atmosphere, called the homosphere (100 km [about 65 miles]), turbulence causes a continuous mixing of the atmospheric constituents, whereas in the heterosphere, above 100 km, the various constituents tend to separate out.
In the heterosphere, the concentrations of the heavier constituents, such as nitrogen or oxygen, decrease more rapidly with increasing altitude than do the concentrations of lighter gases, such as hydrogen or helium; and eventually the atmosphere is dominated by the lighter gases. Under mean daytime conditions, helium and its ion become dominant around 1,000 km (620 miles) and hydrogen and protons above 2,500 km (1,555 miles). The density in the protonosphere continues to decrease with altitude, finally merging with the interplanetary medium about 100,000 km (62,100 miles) above the surface of the Earth.
Solar ultraviolet radiation, which dissociates molecules of water vapour, methane, and hydrogen, is the primary source of atomic hydrogen. Because these constituents exist as well on Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, it is suspected that these planets also possess a corresponding protonosphere.
