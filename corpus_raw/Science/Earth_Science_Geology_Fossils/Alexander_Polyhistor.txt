Alexander Polyhistor, in full Lucius Cornelius Alexander Polyhistor,  (born c. 105 bc, Miletus, Asia Minor [now in Turkey]—died c. 35 bc, Laurentum, near Rome [Italy]), philosopher, geographer, and historian whose fragmentary writings provide valuable information on antiquarian and Jewish subjects.
Imprisoned by the Romans in the war of the Roman general Sulla against King Mithradates VI of Pontus, Alexander was sold as a slave to a patrician and taken to Rome to educate his master’s children. Alexander was freed and granted Roman citizenship by Sulla in the late 80s bc. After his release he continued to live in Italy as a Roman citizen. He was the teacher of another polymath, Gaius Julius Hyginus.
Alexander’s most important work, of which only fragments exist, consists of 42 books of historical and geographical accounts of nearly all the countries of the ancient world. His other notable treatise is about the Jews; it reproduces in paraphrase relevant excerpts from Jewish, Samaritan, and Gentile writers and is valuable for preserving the substance of Hellenistic Jewish authors of whom otherwise nothing would be known. Alexander also wrote a history of philosophy and geographical commentaries on the Greek lyric poets Alcman and Corinna.
