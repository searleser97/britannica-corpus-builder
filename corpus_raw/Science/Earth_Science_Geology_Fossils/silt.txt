Silt,   sediment particles ranging from 0.004 to 0.06 mm (0.00016 to 0.0024 inch) in diameter irrespective of mineral type. Silt is easily transported by moving currents but settles in still water. It constitutes about 60 percent of the material in the Mississippi River delta. An unconsolidated aggregate of silt particles is also termed silt, whereas a consolidated aggregate is called siltstone. Silt deposits formed by wind are known as loess, a yellow, unconsolidated rock. Sediments are seldom composed entirely of silt but rather are a mixture of clay, silt, and sand. Clay-rich silt, upon consolidation, frequently develops parting along bedding surfaces and is called shale. If parting does not develop, the massive rock is called mudstone.
