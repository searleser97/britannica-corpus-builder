David Thompson,  (born April 30, 1770, London, Eng.—died  Feb. 10, 1857, Longeuil, Lower Canada [now Quebec]), English explorer, geographer, and fur trader in the western parts of what are now Canada and the United States. He was the first white man to explore the Columbia River from source to mouth. His maps of western North America served as a basis for all subsequent ones.
Thompson was apprenticed to the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1784 and worked as a clerk in northern and western Canada until 1796, when he made an expedition for the company to Lake Athabasca. He left the company in 1797 to join and become a partner in the rival North West Company and continued to explore and trade on the western plains.
In 1797 Thompson descended a stretch of the Missouri River, and in 1798 he discovered Turtle Lake, one of the headwaters of the Mississippi River. In 1807 he crossed the Rocky Mountains by the Howse Pass and built the first trading post on the Columbia River. Having explored what is now northwest Montana, Thompson descended the length of the Columbia River in 1811. He then settled in Terrebonne, near Montreal, and drew up maps of the newly explored territory.
Thompson acted as an astronomer and surveyor for the commission that charted the border between Canada and the United States from 1818 to 1826. He conducted other surveys but was not recognized as a geographer until after his death.
