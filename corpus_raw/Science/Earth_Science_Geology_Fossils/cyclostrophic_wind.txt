Cyclostrophic wind,  wind circulation that results from a balance between the local atmospheric pressure gradient and the centrifugal force. It can approximate the behaviour of the wind in the atmosphere near the Equator, where the influence of the Coriolis force in the atmosphere is small.
In small-scale low-pressure systems, such as tornadoes, dust devils, and waterspouts, the radius of curvature of the airflow is relatively small. Cyclostrophic wind flow in these small systems may be either clockwise or counterclockwise, a condition in contrast to larger-scale cyclonic systems, which always rotate in a counterclockwise manner in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.
