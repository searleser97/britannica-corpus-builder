Aleš Hrdlička,  (born March 29, 1869, Humpolec, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary—died  Sept. 5, 1943, Washington, D.C., U.S.), physical anthropologist known for his studies of Neanderthal man and his theory of the migration of American Indians from Asia.
Though born in Bohemia, Hrdlička came to America with his family at an early age. He studied medicine and practiced briefly until he left for Paris in 1896 to study anthropology with L.P. Manouvrier. Later that year he returned to the United States and became an associate in anthropology in the New York Pathological Institute. In 1899 he became the director of physical anthropology for expeditions sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History. In 1910 he became curator of the physical anthropology collections at the Smithsonian Institution, having been assistant curator for the previous seven years.
It was in his capacity as curator that Hrdlička made his extensive travels, examining many of the sites where Pithecanthropus had been found, as well as the sites of various Paleolithic settlements. His pioneering work, however, was done in the study of Homo neanderthalensis. In 1927 he published the first of his major theories in an article entitled “The Neanderthal Phase of Man,” in which he sought to prove that Homo sapiens had developed from Homo neanderthalensis and that all human races had a common origin. In a later work, he postulated that mankind could have developed only in the Old World.
In 1927 Hrdlička began organizing expeditions to Alaska and the Bering Strait and developed the theory that native Americans came from Asia across the Bering Strait. Among the numerous honours that he received was the naming of the Hrdlička Museum of Man in Prague after him.
