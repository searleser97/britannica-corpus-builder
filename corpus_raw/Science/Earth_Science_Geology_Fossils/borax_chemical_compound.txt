Borax, also called tincal,  sodium tetraborate decahydrate (Na2B4O7·10H2O). A soft and light, colourless crystalline substance, borax is used in many ways—as a component of glass and pottery glazes in the ceramics industry, as a solvent for metal-oxide slags in metallurgy, as a flux in welding and soldering, and as a fertilizer additive, a soap supplement, a disinfectant, a mouthwash, and a water softener.
Borax has been known since early times, when it was obtained from saline lakes in Kashmir and Tibet and taken to Europe to be refined. It has been produced commercially from colemanite, kernite, and tincalconite, as well as from the mineral borax, by dissolving the ore in water, filtering out the clay, and evaporating the solution. Colemanite was the chief source until the 1930s, when it was supplanted by kernite, which was subsequently replaced by the mineral borax. About 50 percent of the world’s supply of commercial boron compounds comes from southern California: the borax crusts and brine from Searles Lake, the large kernite and borax deposits near Kramer, and the colemanite deposits from Death Valley, formed by the evaporation of hot springs or saline lakes and playas. For detailed physical properties, see borate mineral (table).
