saturation deficit,  an index of humidity typically characterized by the difference between the saturation vapour pressure and the actual vapour pressure of a volume of air. The index has the particular utility of being proportional to the evaporation capability of the air. It is sometimes conveyed in terms of absolute or relative humidity rather than in terms of vapour pressure.
The saturation deficit can be expressed aswhere e is the actual vapour pressure for a given volume of air and ew is the saturation vapour pressure of the volume at a given temperature. The saturation vapour pressure will rise with rising temperature, and thus the same relative humidity U will correspond to a greater saturation deficit and increased evaporation at warm temperatures. Considering an example where the vapour pressure of a parcel of air at 25 °C is 17 millibars (mb), the air has (31 − 17), or 14, mb less vapour pressure than saturated vapour at the same temperature, and thus the saturation deficit in this example is 14 mb (0.01 standard atmosphere).
