Theralite,  any member of a group of intrusive igneous rocks that contain labradorite (basic plagioclase feldspar), nepheline, and titaniferous augite. Theralites are classified in the nepheline-tephrite group in this series (see also nephelinite). Olivine, biotite, orthoclase feldspar, and an alkali amphibole may be present as subordinate constituents. With the exception of nepheline and orthoclase, the minerals of theralites are usually present in well-shaped crystals. Nepheline itself may be largely represented by secondary zeolites.
Theralites are comparatively rare. They are found in the Odenwald, in Germany; the Serra de Monchique of Portugal; the Kola Peninsula of Russia; and western Scotland. Closely related rocks include teschenite, essexite, and shonkinite.
