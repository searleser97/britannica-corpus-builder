Brian Jones,  (born March 27, 1947, Bristol, Eng.), British aviator who on March 20, 1999, with captain Bertrand Piccard, completed the first nonstop circumnavigation of the globe by balloon. The trip, begun by Jones and Piccard on March 1 aboard the Breitling Orbiter 3, took 19 days, 21 hours, and 55 minutes to complete. Starting in the Swiss Alps, the balloon carried the pair over Europe, Africa, Asia, Central America, and the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
Jones learned to fly at age 16 and left school early for a 13-year stint in the Royal Air Force. Although he did not get involved in ballooning until 1986, by 1989 he had acquired a balloon-flying license and become an instructor. He served as project manager of a number of Breitling missions, overseeing construction of the craft. He was originally designated as a third copilot of Breitling Orbiter 3 but became Piccard’s sole copilot after Wim Verstraeten and another pilot backed out of the flight.
Several high-profile attempts to circumnavigate the globe via balloon, including those by American adventurer Steve Fossett and British billionaire Richard Branson, failed in the months leading up to Piccard and Jones’s successful flight. Although Piccard and Jones had to skirt a number of no-fly zones, they received permission to fly over southern China and thus were able to catch a key jet stream over the Pacific. They ended their historic flight on March 21 in Egypt, with a safe landing near the Pyramids of Giza. The Breitling Orbiter 3 gondola was recovered and placed on display at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.
Upon completion of the circumnavigation, Jones helped plan a number of high-profile ballooning projects, including an attempt to break the ballooning altitude record. In 2004 he joined Piccard’s Solar Impulse project as a mission coordinator. He was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999.
