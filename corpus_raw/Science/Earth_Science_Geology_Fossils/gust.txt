Gust,  in meteorology, a sudden increase in wind speed above the average wind speed. More specifically, wind speed must temporarily peak above 16 knots (about 30 km per hour) after accelerating by at least 9–10 knots (about 17–19 km per hour) to qualify as a gust. A gust 
is briefer than a squall and usually lasts 20 seconds or less. Air turbulence around an obstacle causes gusts; they occur frequently over buildings and irregular ground and are less frequent over water. The term gust also denotes a sudden change in wind speed relative to a flying aircraft.
