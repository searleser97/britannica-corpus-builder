Saltpetre, also spelled Saltpeter, also called Nitre, or Niter,  any of three naturally occurring nitrates, distinguished as (1) ordinary saltpetre, or potassium nitrate, KNO3; (2) Chile saltpetre, cubic nitre, or sodium nitrate, NaNO3; and (3) lime saltpetre, wall saltpetre, or calcium nitrate, Ca(NO3)2. These three nitrates generally occur as efflorescences caused by the oxidation of nitrogenous matter in the presence of the alkalis and alkaline earths.
Potassium nitrate occurs as crusts on the surface of the Earth, on walls and rocks, and in caves; and it forms in certain soils in Spain, Italy, Egypt, Iran, and India. The deposits in the great limestone caves of Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana have probably been derived from the overlying soil and accumulated by percolating water. In former times, the demand for saltpetre as an ingredient of gunpowder led to the formation of saltpetre plantations, or nitriaries, which were common in France, Germany, and other countries; the natural conditions were simulated by exposing heaps of decaying organic matter mixed with alkalis (lime, etc.) to atmospheric action. Potassium nitrate was used at one time in many different diseased conditions, especially asthma; but now it is rarely used medicinally, except as a diuretic. Its alleged value as a drug for suppressing sexual desire is purely imaginary.
Potassium nitrate is white in colour and soluble in water; it has a vitreous lustre and a cool and salty taste.
Sodium nitrate occurs, under the same conditions as ordinary saltpetre, in deposits covering immense areas in South America, abounding especially in the regions of Tarapac√° and Antofagasta in Chile. The chief applications of Chile saltpetre are in the nitric acid industry and particularly as a fertilizer.
Calcium nitrate was once common as an efflorescence on the walls of stables; it is now manufactured from atmospheric nitrogen. Its chief applications are as a manure and in the nitric acid industry.
