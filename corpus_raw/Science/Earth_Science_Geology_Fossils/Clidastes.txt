Clidastes,  (genus Clidastes),  extinct ancient marine lizards belonging to a family of reptiles called mosasaurs. Clidastes fossils are found in marine rocks from the Late Cretaceous Period (99.6 million to 65.5 million years ago) in North America. Excellent specimens have been found in the chalk deposits of Kansas.
Clidastes was 4 metres (13 feet) or longer; the head alone was about 60 cm (24 inches) long and was equipped with many sharply pointed curved teeth. The neck was short, but the body and tail were long and relatively slender. This aquatic lizard probably swam by undulating its body in the same way that terrestrial lizards do. The limbs terminated in broad appendages that provided directional control as it moved through the water. Clidastes was clearly an efficiently swimming predator and probably fed mostly on fish as well as on ammonoids (a cephalopod similar to the present-day nautilus). Clidastes and other mosasaurs may have gone ashore to reproduce.
