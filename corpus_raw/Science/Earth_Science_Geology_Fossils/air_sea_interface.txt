air-sea interface,  boundary between the atmosphere and the ocean waters. The air-sea interface is one of the most physically and chemically active environments on Earth. Its neighbourhood supports most marine life.
The atmosphere gains much of its heat at the interface in tropical latitudes by back radiation from the heated ocean. In turn, the atmosphere heats the ocean surface in higher latitudes. Atmospheric motion at the interface generates waves and currents. The atmosphere acquires most of its moisture and additional energy in the form of latent heat from the evaporation of water at the interface. Enormous quantities of oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the atmosphere and the ocean at the interface; this exchange aids and benefits from marine life processes.
The impact of climate at the interface controls the salinities and temperatures of surface ocean waters. The density of seawater is determined by these parameters and, in turn, controls to which depths in the ocean the water masses flow. Photosynthesis, the fundamental basis for oceanic life, takes place just below the interface, where the necessary ingredients of solar energy, carbon dioxide, and nutrient seawater salts are all available.
