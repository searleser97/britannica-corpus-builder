Kainite,  a naturally occurring double salt, hydrated potassium and magnesium sulfate-chloride, KMgSO4ClÂ·3H2O. It has been found only in potash deposits and is the principal constituent of the large salt deposits in middle and northern Germany. Water decomposes kainite to epsomite and sylvite. For chemical formula and detailed physical properties, see sulfate mineral (table).
