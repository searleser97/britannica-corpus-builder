Cataclastite,  any rock produced by dynamic metamorphism during which faulting, granulation, and flowage may occur in previously crystalline parent rocks. When stress exceeds breaking strength, a rock yields by rupture. The rock may break as a unit, or individual minerals may be selectively granulated. The stress is generally not the same in all directions, so that movement in a preferred direction occurs, with slippage planes, granulation, or partial flowage being oriented preferentially. Some cataclastites are derived from igneous parent rocks, such as granite; in these, streaks of partially destroyed rock swirl around still-intact rock. Many cataclastites are derived from sedimentary rocks, including limestones and dolomites.
Mylonites are the products of extreme cataclastic deformation. They are extremely fine-grained, but mineral fragments of the parent rock can be seen under the microscope. Most mylonites are laminated, the layers formed by different grain sizes of deformed material.
Phyllonites are like mylonites in that they are fine-grained and are shaped by deformation, but in phyllonites there has been a reconstitution of the minerals. Some of the parent-rock minerals are re-formed with a different orientation, and new minerals are formed in response to the metamorphic conditions.
