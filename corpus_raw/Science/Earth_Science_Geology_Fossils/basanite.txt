Basanite,   extrusive igneous rock that contains calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar (usually labradorite or bytownite), feldspathoid (usually nepheline or leucite), olivine, and pyroxene (titanaugite). Basanite grades into tephrite, which contains no olivine.
In basanites and tephrites, the plagioclase occurs as large, single crystals (phenocrysts). The feldspathoid (nepheline) in nepheline-basanite and nepheline-tephrite occurs mainly in the matrix (groundmass), whereas that in leucite-basanite and leucite-tephrite (leucite) occurs abundantly in crystals as well. Olivine occurs as phenocrysts, as does the augite. Biotite, apatite, and titanium-rich magnetite are common accessories.
Basanites and tephrites occur as gray to black rocks in sheets and flows. Places where basanites are found include Spain, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand, and the southwestern United States; tephrites are found in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Greenland, Uganda, and Colorado.
