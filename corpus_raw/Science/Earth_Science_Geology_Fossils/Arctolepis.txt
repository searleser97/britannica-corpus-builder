Arctolepis,   extinct genus of placoderms (fishlike animals) present during the early part of the Devonian Period (416 million to 360 million years ago), member of a group known as the arthrodires, or jointed-neck fishes. Arctolepis had a bony head and trunk shield but was unarmoured behind the trunk region; the body tapered to a pointed tail; a tail fin was developed only on the lower margin of the tail. Arctolepis was a small animal, less than 30 cm (12 inches) in length but with enormously developed pectoral spines that must have been some aid to swimming and possibly a deterrent to keep from being swallowed.
