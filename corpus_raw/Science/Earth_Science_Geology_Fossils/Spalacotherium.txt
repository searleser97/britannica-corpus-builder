Spalacotherium,  extinct genus of primitive, probably predaceous, mammals known from fossils found in European deposits dating from the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods (some 160 million â€“100 million years ago). The genus Spalacotherium has a symmetrodont dentition, characterized by molar teeth with three cusps arranged in a triangle. The symmetrodonts are among the oldest known mammals and also among the most common European faunas of the time.
