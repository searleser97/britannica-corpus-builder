George Dollond,  (born Jan. 25, 1774, London, Eng.â€”died  May 13, 1852, London), British optician who invented a number of precision instruments used in astronomy, geodesy, and navigation.
Throughout most of his life, he worked for the family firm of mathematical instrument makers, assuming full control after the retirement in 1819 of his uncle Peter Dollond. His micrometer made of rock crystal, announced in 1821, was used by the English astronomer William Rutter Dawes in measuring close double stars. Other inventions followed, including improvements to astronomical and navigation devices. Dollond received the council medal of the Great Exhibition of 1851 for his atmospheric recorder that simultaneously measured and recorded on paper tape temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction, evaporation, and electrical phenomena.
