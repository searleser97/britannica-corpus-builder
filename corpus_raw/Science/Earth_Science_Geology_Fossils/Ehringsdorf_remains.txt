Ehringsdorf remains,  human fossils found between 1908 and 1925 near Weimar, Germany. The most complete fossils consist of a fragmented braincase and lower jaw of an adult and the lower jaw, trunk, and arm bones of a child. The skull was found along with elephant, rhinoceros, horse, and bovid fossil remains; it has been dated to about 200,000 years ago. The Ehringsdorf fossils resemble those of Neanderthals with some more-archaic features. The Ehringsdorf skull is usually classified as an early Neanderthal because of the size of the browridges, the long and low braincase, and the strong lower jaw lacking a chin.
