Batholith,  large body of igneous rock formed beneath the Earthâ€™s surface by the intrusion and solidification of magma. It is commonly composed of coarse-grained rocks (e.g., granite or granodiorite) with a surface exposure of 100 square km (40 square miles) or larger. A batholith has an irregular shape with side walls that incline steeply against the host rock. Most batholiths intrude across mountain folds and are elongated along the dominant axis of the range; faulting and contact metamorphism of the enveloping rock near the batholith is also observed. Although batholiths were once believed to extend to unknown depths, recent studies have shown that many of them have a thickness of perhaps 10 to 15 km (6 to 9 miles). A well-known batholith is located in the Sierra Nevada range of California, U.S.
