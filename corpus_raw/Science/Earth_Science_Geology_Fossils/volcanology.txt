volcanology, also spelled vulcanology,  discipline of the geologic sciences that is concerned with all aspects of volcanic phenomena.
Volcanology deals with the formation, distribution, and classification of volcanoes as well as with their structure and the kinds of materials ejected during an eruption (such as pyroclastic flows, lava, dust, ash, and volcanic gases). It also involves research on the relationships between volcanic eruptions and other large-scale geologic processes such as plate tectonics, mountain building, and earthquakes. One of the chief objectives of this research is determining the nature and causes of volcanic eruptions for the purpose of forecasting their occurrence. Another practical concern of volcanology is securing data that may aid in locating commercially valuable deposits of ores, particularly those of certain sulfide minerals.
Interest in volcanic phenomena extends back to ancient times. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in ad 79 was recorded in considerable detail by Pliny the Younger. Studies of volcanoes, however, were not conducted systematically until the 19th century. Since that time volcanology has become an important branch of physical geology. Specialists in the field, using the principles and methods of geophysics and geochemistry and the tools of seismology and geodesy, have obtained much knowledge of processes that occur within the Earthâ€™s interior.
