Cheirolepis,  extinct genus of primitive fishes whose fossils are found in European and North American rocks of the Devonian period (408 to 360 million years ago). The genus Cheirolepis is representative of the paleoniscoids, a group of primitive ray-finned fishes, and may represent the common ancestor of more recent ray-finned fishes. Cheirolepis was slim and streamlined, with many teeth, indicating that it was an active predator. The tail was upturned, and the tail fin was supported beneath it. The dorsal fin was single, whereas the pectoral fins were broadly attached and had limited flexibility. The eyes were large and placed well forward in the skull.
