Ferdinand Paul Wilhelm, baron von Richthofen,  (born May 5, 1833, Carlsruhe, Upper Silesia, Prussia [now in Poland]—died October 6, 1905, Berlin, Germany), German geographer and geologist who produced a major work on China and contributed to the development of geographical methodology. He also helped establish the science of geomorphology, the branch of geology that deals with land and submarine relief features.
After making his reputation with geological investigations in the Dolomite Alps and in Transylvania, Richthofen was invited in 1860 to serve as geologist with a German economic mission to the Far East. He visited Ceylon, Japan, Formosa, the Celebes, Java, and the Philippines and traveled from Bangkok to Moulmein, Myanmar. From there he went to California, where he remained from 1863 to 1868 and conducted geological investigations, some of which led to the discovery of goldfields. He returned to the Orient, and, on a series of journeys, he visited virtually every part of China, gathering material for his great work, China, Ergebnisse eigener Reisen und darauf gegründeter Studien, 5 vol. and atlas (1877–1912; “China, the Results of My Travels and the Studies Based Thereon”). Other of Richthofen’s writings include Aufgaben und Methoden der heutigen Geographie (1883; “Task and Methods of Present-day Geography”) and Treibkräfte und Richtungen der Erdkunde im neunzehnten Jahrhundert (1903; “Impulses and Directions of Geography in the 19th Century”).
