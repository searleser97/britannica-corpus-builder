Filter-pressing,   process that occurs during the crystallization of intrusive igneous bodies in which the interstitial liquid is separated from the crystals by pressure. As crystals grow and accumulate in a magmatic body, a crystal mesh may be formed, with the remaining liquid distributed in the interstices. This mesh may result from crystals that sink to the floor of the magma chamber or from crystals that accumulate during the advanced stages of crystallization of the body. Pressure applied by the weight of the overlying crystals or by outside forces may force the more mobile liquid out of the crystal mesh and also may fracture or crush the remaining crystals. Filter-pressing has been used to explain the formation of monomineralic rocks or rocks with an apparently unusual mineralogical and chemical compositionâ€”e.g., anorthosite.
