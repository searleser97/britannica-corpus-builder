Dip circle, also called Dip Needle, or Inclinometer,  instrument for measuring the inclination, or dip, of the Earth’s magnetic field. It consists essentially of a magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of a graduated circle. The assembly is mounted such that the needle swings vertically rather than horizontally, as does a compass needle. When the instrument is placed with the plane of the circle in the magnetic meridian of the Earth, the needle points in the direction of the Earth’s magnetic field.
