Shonkinite,   rare, dark-coloured, intrusive igneous rock that contains augite and orthoclase feldspar as its primary constituents. Other minerals include olivine, biotite, and nepheline, with little plagioclase feldspar and no quartz. At Shonkin-Sag, in the Highwood Mountains, Montana, shonkinite forms the greater part of a stratified laccolith (inserted between sedimentary beds). It also occurs in Ontario, British Columbia, and Indonesia (Celebes, Timor).
