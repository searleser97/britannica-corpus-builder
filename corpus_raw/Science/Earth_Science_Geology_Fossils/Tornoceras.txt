Tornoceras,  extinct genus of cephalopods, forms related to the modern pearly nautilus. Tornoceras is a form that emerged during the Devonian Period (416 million years to 359 million years ago). The shell is circular in outline and rather flat; the final whorl covers earlier whorls. The sutural pattern between successive chambers of the shell is gently rippled.
