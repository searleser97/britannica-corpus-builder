Wabar Craters,   group of meteorite craters discovered in 1932 in the Rubʿ al-Khalī desert of Saudi Arabia. The largest crater is 330 feet (100 m) in diameter, 40 feet (12 m) deep, partially filled with sand, and thought to be an explosion crater (formed from an explosion on impact). A crater located 0.6 mile (1 km) northwest is about half the size of the main crater and is thought to be two partially superimposed craters. Two others in the area are completely filled with sand. Fused silica glass and tiny globules of nickel-iron have been found near the main crater.
