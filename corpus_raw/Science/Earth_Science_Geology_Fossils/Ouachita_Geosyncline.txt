Ouachita Geosyncline,  a linear trough in the Earth’s crust in which rocks of the Paleozoic Era (from 542 million to 251 million years ago) were deposited along the southern margin of North America, from Mississippi to eastern Mexico. Most of the belt is overlain by undisturbed, younger rocks of the Mississippi Embayment and the Gulf Coastal Plain, but marginal parts of the belt are exposed in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, the Marathon uplift of western Texas, and scattered remnants in northeastern Mexico. The oldest exposed rocks are of Cambrian age; the youngest are Middle Pennsylvanian, in the Ouachita Mountains, and Late Pennsylvanian, in the Marathon uplift. The geosyncline’s rocks of Cambrian through Devonian age consist of dark, siliceous shales, sandstones, and cherts, which indicate slow deposition over a long period of time. Its Mississippian through Pennsylvanian rocks, on the other hand, consist of thick sequences of shales and sandstones deposited rapidly in a subsiding trough.
Deformation of the geosyncline probably began during Early Paleozoic time in the buried interior portions of the geosyncline, but the marginal exposed portions were not deformed until the Late Pennsylvanian Period in the Ouachita Mountains and Early Permian in the Marathon uplift. Deformation, based on the evidence now available, seems to have shifted through time from the interior portions of the geosyncline northward to the marginal portions. The name Ouachita orogeny is applied to the event that resulted in the folding and northward thrusting of the exposed marginal part of the geosyncline.
The Ouachita Geosyncline may represent a southward continuation of the Appalachian Geosyncline, which was displaced westward by the opening up of the Gulf of Mexico in the Early Mesozoic.
