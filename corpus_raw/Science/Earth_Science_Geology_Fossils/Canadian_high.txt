Canadian high, also called North American high,  large weak semipermanent atmospheric high-pressure centre produced by the low temperatures over northern Canada. Covering much of North America, its cold dense air does not extend above 3 km (2 miles). The highâ€™s location east of the Canadian Rockies shelters it from the relatively warm Pacific Ocean and helps it maintain its identity. Its average January sea level pressure at its centre is about 1,020 millibars (30.12 inches of mercury). The Canadian high often moves southeastward until it eventually reaches the Atlantic Ocean, where it merges with the Azores high. In the summer the Canadian high is intermittent. When it occurs, it occasionally provides refreshing cool dry air to the eastern and central United States and parts of southern Canada.
