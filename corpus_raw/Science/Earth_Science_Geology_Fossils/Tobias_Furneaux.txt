Tobias Furneaux,  (born Aug. 21, 1735, Swilly, near Plymouth, Devon, Eng.—died Sept. 19, 1781, Swilly), British naval officer and explorer who was first to circumnavigate the globe in both directions.
On Capt. Samuel Wallis’s westerly-directed circumnavigation in the Royal Navy ship Dolphin (1766–68), Furneaux was among the first Europeans to reach Tahiti. As commander of the Adventure, he took part in Capt. James Cook’s second voyage to the Pacific (1771–75). Sailing eastward from the Cape of Good Hope, the Adventure became separated from Cook’s vessel, the Resolution, on Feb. 8, 1773. Furneaux then continued into Australian waters and explored and charted the east and south coasts of Tasmania. The ships were reunited at Queen Charlotte Sound, New Zealand, and went on to Tahiti and the Friendly Islands (Tonga). On their way back to Queen Charlotte Sound, the vessels again became separated (Oct. 29/30, 1773). In New Zealand 10 of Furneaux’s crew were captured, killed, and eaten by Maoris. When the Adventure reached England in July 1774, before the arrival of Cook, it had aboard the first South Sea islander to visit the British Isles. Furneaux commanded the Syren in the British attack on Charleston, S.C. (June 28, 1776).
