Ungava-Quebec Crater, also called New Quebec Crater, formerly Chubb Crater,  geologically young crater of meteoritic origin located in the northwestern part of the Ungava Peninsula, northern Quebec province, Canada. First recognized as an impact structure in 1950, the crater is 3.4 km (2.1 miles) in diameter and has a rim standing as much as 160 metres (525 feet) above ground level. Filled by a lake 250 metres (820 feet) deep, it is surrounded by many smaller circular lakes. The surrounding rocks are tilted upward toward the centre of the crater and are broken here and there by radial fissures. The craterâ€™s age is estimated to be 1.4 million years.
