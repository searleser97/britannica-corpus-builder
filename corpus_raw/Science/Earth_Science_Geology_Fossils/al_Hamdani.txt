Al-Hamdānī, in full Abū Muḥammad al-Ḥasan ibn Aḥmad al-Hamdānī,  (born 893?, Sanaa, Yemen—died c. 945?), Arab geographer, poet, grammarian, historian, and astronomer whose chief fame derives from his authoritative writings on South Arabian history and geography. From his literary production al-Hamdānī was known as the “tongue of South Arabia.”
Most of al-Hamdānī’s life was spent in Arabia itself. He was widely educated, and he traveled extensively, acquiring a broad knowledge of his country. He became involved in a number of political controversies. When he was imprisoned for one of them, his influence was sufficient to invoke a tribal rebellion in his behalf to secure his release.
His encyclopaedia Al-Iklīl (“The Crown”; Eng. trans. of vol. 8 by N.A. Faris as The Antiquities of South Arabia) and his other writings are a major source of information on Arabia, providing a valuable anthology of South Arabian poetry as well as much genealogical, topographical, and historical information. “Al-Dāmighah” (“The Cleaving”), a qaṣīdah, is perhaps his most famous poem; in it he defends his own southern tribe, the Hamdān. It has been said that al-Hamdānī died in prison in Sanaa in 945, but this is now in question.
