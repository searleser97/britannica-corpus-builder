Caudipteryx,  genus of small feathered theropod dinosaurs known from rock deposits of western Liaoning province, China, that date from about 125 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous (146 million to 100 million years ago). Caudipteryx was one of the first-known feathered dinosaurs; fossil specimens have impressions of long feathers on the forearms and tail. These feathers were symmetrical and similar to those of living flightless birds; however, they differed from those of living and fossil flying birds, such as Archaeopteryx. Furthermore, the forelimbs of Caudipteryx were too short to have functioned as wings, suggesting that complex feathers originally evolved in nonflying animals for purposes other than flight.
With its small head, long neck, compact body, and fan of tail feathers, Caudipteryx probably resembled a small pheasant or turkey, and it may have occupied a similar ecological niche. In members of this genus, teeth were present on the premaxillae (the bones at the front of the upper jaw); however, the maxillae and the lower jaws were toothless and presumably beaked. Furthermore, numerous gastroliths (stomach stones) were found in the rib cages of some specimens; these probably functioned as a gastric mill for grinding up tough forage, such as plant material and the chitinous exoskeletons of insects, as in the muscular gizzards of many birds.
Caudipteryx was a primitive member of Oviraptorosauria, a group of theropods that were closely related to birds. Oviraptorosaurs differed from most other theropods in having a deep belly and a short, stiff tail. In addition, many forms had few, if any, teeth. According to some authorities, the reduced dentition and deep abdomen may have been adaptations for herbivory. Some oviraptorosaurs, however, possessed significant numbers of teeth, and these forms may have been omnivorous or insectivorous.
