Ronne Ice Shelf,  large body of floating ice, lying at the head of the Weddell Sea, which is itself an indentation in the Atlantic coastline of Antarctica. More than 500 feet (150 metres) thick and extending inland for more than 520 miles (840 km), it lies immediately west of Filchner Ice Shelf, from which it is partially separated by Berkner Island. Often the names of the two ice shelves are combined as the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. This name is appropriate, because they are only partly separated by Berkner Island, and the combined ice shelf originally bore the name Filchner. The Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf has a combined area of about 163,000 square miles (422,000 square km), making it one of the two largest ice shelves on Earth. Radio-echo sounding and coring suggest that a substantial amount of the ice thickness was formed by the accretion of ice crystals from cooled seawater below. Oceanographic data, however, suggest an average net loss by subshelf melting of 11.4–11.8 inches (290–300 mm) per year. Named for Edith Ronne, wife of the American explorer Finn Ronne, the ice shelf was claimed by the United Kingdom (1908), Chile (1940), and Argentina (1942).
