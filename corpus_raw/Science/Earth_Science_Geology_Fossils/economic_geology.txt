Economic geology,   scientific discipline concerned with the distribution of mineral deposits, the economic considerations involved in their recovery, and an assessment of the reserves available.
Economic geology deals with metal ores, fossil fuels (e.g., petroleum, natural gas, and coal), and other materials of commercial value, such as salt, gypsum, and building stone. It applies the principles and methods of various other fields of the geologic sciences, most notably geophysics, structural geology, and stratigraphy (qq.v.). Its chief objective is to guide the exploration for mineral resources and help determine which deposits are economically worthwhile to mine. Specialists in economic geology often assist in the extraction of the mineral commodities as well.
