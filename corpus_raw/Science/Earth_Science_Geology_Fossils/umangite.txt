Umangite,   a copper selenide (Cu3Se2) occurring only in small grains or fine granular aggregates with other copper minerals of the sulfide group. The mineral is bluish black with a reddish tint. Deposits of the mineral are found in the Sierra de Umango (for which it is named) in Argentina; in the Harz Mountains of Germany; and at Skrickerum, Sweden. Umangite alters to malachite. For detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
