Icelandic low,  large persistent atmospheric low-pressure centre that forms between Iceland and southern Greenland. It often causes strong winter winds over the North Atlantic Ocean. In winter the ocean is considerably warmer than the continents, and this difference is responsible for the location of the Icelandic low, which dominates the wind circulation over the North Atlantic (see North Atlantic Oscillation). In summer the low weakens and often divides into two separate cells, one located over western Iceland and another located over the Davis Strait. Its January mean sea-level pressure is below 996 millibars (29.4 inches of mercury).
