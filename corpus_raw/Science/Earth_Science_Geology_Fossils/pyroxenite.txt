Pyroxenite,  dark-coloured, intrusive igneous rock that consists chiefly of pyroxene. Pyroxenites are not abundant; they occur in discrete inclusions, in layered sills (tabular bodies inserted between other rocks) and lopoliths (laccoliths with basin-shaped bases), in branching veins, in narrow dikes (tabular bodies injected in fissures), and at the edges of silica-poor plutons (intrusive igneous rock bodies). Many of the pyroxenites have been named according to their dominant pyroxene mineralâ€”e.g., diopsidite, which occurs in the Pyrenees, and orthopyroxene, which occurs in the Bushveld of South Africa. Others occur at Newry, County Down, Ire. (biotite pyroxenite); in the province of Quebec, Can. (hornblende pyroxenite); and at Ben More Assynt, Scot. (melanite pyroxenite).
