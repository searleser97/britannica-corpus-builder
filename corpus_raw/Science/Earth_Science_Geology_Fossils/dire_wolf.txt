Dire wolf,  (Aenocyon dirus),  canine that existed during the Pleistocene Epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). It is probably the most common mammalian species to be found preserved in the La Brea Tar Pits in southern California. The dire wolf differed from the modern gray wolf (Canis lupus) in several ways: it was larger and it had a more massive skull, a smaller brain, and relatively light limbs. The species was considerably widespread, and skeletal remains have been found in Florida, the Mississippi River valley, and the Valley of Mexico.
The lineage that included the dire wolves and their ancestors emerged some 5.7 million years ago during the late Miocene Epoch (which lasted from 23 million to about 5.3 million years ago), and it evolved independently of the lineage that produced modern wolves and their close relatives. Dire wolves first appeared in the Americas, and there is no evidence that they interbred with gray wolves (which originated in Eurasia before dispersing to North America).
