Campo del Cielo craters,  group of small craters in the Gran Chaco region, near the hamlet of Campo del Cielo, north-central Argentina. These craters were attributed in 1933 to meteoritic origin. The largest crater is 250 feet (75 metres); its rim stands 3 feet (1 metre) above the surrounding land. Fused silica glass was found in one of the smaller craters nearby, indicating the occurrence of an impact explosion. If the many small, circular lakes nearby are of meteoritic origin, then this group of craters is possibly the largest in the world. Several large meteorites of the same composition have been found (the first in 1576) in the general area and might be associated with the fall that produced the Campo del Cielo craters.
