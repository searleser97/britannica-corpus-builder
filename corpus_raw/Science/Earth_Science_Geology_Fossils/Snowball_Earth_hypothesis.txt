Snowball Earth hypothesis,  in geology and climatology, an explanation first proposed by American geobiologist J.L. Kirschvink suggesting that Earth’s oceans and land surfaces were covered by ice from the poles to the Equator during at least two extreme cooling events between 2.4 billion and 580 million years ago.
The evidence for this hypothesis is found in old rocks that preserved signs of Earth’s ancient magnetic field. Measurements of these rocks indicate that rocks known to be associated with the presence of ice were formed near the Equator. In addition, there is a 45-metre- (147.6-foot-) thick layer of manganese ore in the Kalahari Desert with an age corresponding to the end of the 2.4 billion-year “Snowball Earth” period; its deposition is thought to have been caused by rapid and massive changes in global climate as the worldwide covering of ice melted.
Two important questions arise from this hypothesis. First, how, once frozen, could Earth thaw? Second, how could life survive periods of global freezing? One proposed solution to the first question involves the outgassing of massive amounts of carbon dioxide by volcanoes, which could have warmed the planetary surface rapidly by enhancing the planet’s so-called greenhouse effect, especially given that major carbon dioxide sinks (rock weathering and photosynthesis) would have been dampened by a frozen Earth.
 One possible answer to the second question may lie in the existence of present-day life-forms within hot springs and deep-sea vents, which would have persisted long ago despite the frozen state of Earth’s surface. Alternatively, meltwater ponds on the surface of the ice or warmer refugia near active volcanoes may have provided sanctuary to early life-forms.
Much debate continues to surround this idea, and many critics have voiced their support for a competing premise called the “Slushball Earth hypothesis.”
