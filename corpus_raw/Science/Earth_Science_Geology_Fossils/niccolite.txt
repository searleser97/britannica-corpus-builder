Niccolite,   an ore mineral of nickel, nickel arsenide (NiAs). It is commonly found associated with other nickel arsenides and sulfides, as in the Natsume nickel deposits, Japan; Andreas-Berg, Ger.; Sudbury, Ont.; and Silver Cliff, Colo. Niccolite is classified in a group of sulfide minerals that exhibit a characteristic hexagonal structure. The name, a derivative of the German word Kupfernickel, is a reference to subterranean imps (Nickel) who teased miners. For detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
