Joseph Paxson Iddings,  (born Jan. 21, 1857, Baltimore, Md., U.S.—died  Sept. 8, 1920, Brinklow, Md.), American geologist who demonstrated the genetic relationships of neighbouring igneous rocks formed during a single period of magmatic activity.
Iddings joined the U.S. Geological Survey in 1880. From 1883 to 1890 he worked with the team surveying Yellowstone National Park, and in 1895 he became professor of petrology at the University of Chicago. He collaborated in preparing the Quantitative Classification of Igneous Rocks (1903) and later published Igneous Rocks (1909–13), Rock Minerals (1906), and The Problem of Volcanism (1914).
From his studies of the graduation of texture and chemical composition among rocks, Iddings concluded that physical conditions affect the essential mineral composition as well as the crystal structure of rocks. He showed that crystalline variations depend upon temperature and rate of cooling, and he thus challenged the widely held opinion that granular rocks were produced only in large masses at great depths.
