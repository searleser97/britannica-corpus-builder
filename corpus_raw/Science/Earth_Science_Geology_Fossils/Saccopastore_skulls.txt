Saccopastore skulls,  two Neanderthal fossils found in 1929 and 1935 in a river deposit on the bank of a small tributary of the Tiber River outside Rome. The skulls, which represent an early phase in the development of western European Neanderthals, are between 70,000 and 100,000 years old.
The strong development of the arched browridges, the moderate-sized cheek teeth and large front teeth, and the long, low, and rounded braincase are all characteristic of Neanderthals. The skulls also exhibit prominent lesions on the teeth, indicating periods of severe starvation during childhood.
