American Philosophical Society,  oldest extant learned society in the United States, founded under the impetus of Benjamin Franklin in 1743. At the beginning of the 21st century, it had more than 850 members, elected for their scholarly and scientific accomplishments in any of five areas—the mathematical and physical sciences; the biological sciences; the social sciences; the humanities; and the arts, professions, and leaders in public and private affairs. Its headquarters are in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
From a group of young men called the Junto—formed in Philadelphia by Franklin in 1727, when he was only 21—there grew an interest in experiment and inquiry that resulted in his publication in 1743 of A Proposal for Promoting Useful Knowledge Among the British Plantations in America. This proposal was so favourably received that the American Philosophical Society was organized with Thomas Hopkinson as president and Franklin as secretary. In 1769 it was united with another scientific society founded by Franklin (the American Society), and Franklin was elected president (an office he held until his death in 1790); the new society was incorporated in 1780. The astronomer David Rittenhouse was the united society’s second president (1791–96), and Thomas Jefferson was its third (1797–1814).
The American Philosophical Society occupies two buildings in Independence National Historical Park, Philadelphia—the Philosophical Hall (erected 1785–89) and the Library, a replica of the original home of the Library Company of Philadelphia (1798); the library and meeting rooms contain rich collections of manuscripts (some 7,000,000) and books on American science and culture. The society’s publications include Memoirs, Proceedings, Transactions, and Year Book.
