Aleutian Current, also called Subarctic Current,  surface oceanic current, an eastward-flowing mixture of the Kuroshio (Japan Current) and the Oya Current, located between the Aleutian Islands and latitude 42Â° N. Approaching the North American coast, the current divides to become the Alaska and California currents. Another branch of the Aleutian Current enters the Bering Sea, forming a counterclockwise gyre.
