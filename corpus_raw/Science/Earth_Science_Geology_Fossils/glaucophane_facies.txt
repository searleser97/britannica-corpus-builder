Glaucophane facies,  one of the major divisions of the mineral facies classification of metamorphic rocks, the rocks of which, because of their peculiar mineralogy, suggest formation conditions of high pressure and relatively low temperature; such conditions are not typical of the normal geothermal gradient in the Earth. The minerals that occur include soda amphibole (glaucophane), soda pyroxene (jadeite), garnet, lawsonite, and pumpellyite; quartz, muscovite, chlorite, epidote, and plagioclase may also be present. This mineralogy suggests a close connection with the eclogite facies of regional metamorphism, although lower temperatures are indicated. The low water content of these rocks is noteworthy. A classic area of occurrence is western California.
