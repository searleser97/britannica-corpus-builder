Nesosilicate, formerly called orthosilicate,  compound with a structure in which independent silicate tetrahedrons (each consisting of a central silicon atom surrounded by four oxygen atoms at the corners of a tetrahedron) are present. Because none of the oxygen atoms is shared by other tetrahedrons, the chemical formula contains a multiple of SiO4, as in zircon, topaz, or olivine.
