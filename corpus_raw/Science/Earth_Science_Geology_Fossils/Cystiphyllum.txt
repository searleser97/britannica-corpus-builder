Cystiphyllum,  extinct genus of solitary corals found as fossils in Silurian and Devonian marine rocks (the Silurian Period preceded the Devonian Period and ended 416 million years ago). Cystiphyllum was one of the horn corals, so named for their hornlike shape. Like other corals, it had specialized requirements, and thus its fossils are important environmental indicators.
