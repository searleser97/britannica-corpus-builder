Dinichthys, also called Dunkleosteus,  extinct genus of arthrodires, i.e., primitive, armoured, fishlike animals known as placoderms that dominated ancient seas. Dinichthys lived during the Late Devonian Period (374 to 360 million years ago) and is found fossilized in rocks of that age in Europe, northern Asia, and North America. Dinichthys grew to a length of about 9 metres (30 feet), more than 3 metres of which consisted of an armoured head shield that was hinged in the neck region, permitting the upper jaw to be raised in relation to the lower. Dinichthys was clearly the dominant marine predator of its time.
