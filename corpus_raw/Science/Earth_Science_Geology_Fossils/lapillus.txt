Lapillus, plural Lapilli,  unconsolidated volcanic fragment with a diameter between 4 and 32 mm (0.16 and 1.26 inches) that was ejected during a volcanic explosion. Lapilli may consist of fresh magma, solid magma from a prior eruption, or basement rocks through which the eruption passed. Accretionary lapilli are pellets formed by the accretion of volcanic ash or dust around moisture droplets; as in hailstones formed of water, these volcanic “hailstones” may show concentric rings—some as much as 10 cm (four inches) across—when they are carried through the eruption cloud several times by turbulent updrafts.
