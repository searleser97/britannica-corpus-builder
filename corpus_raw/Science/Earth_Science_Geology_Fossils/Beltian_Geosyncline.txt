Beltian Geosyncline,  a linear trough in the Earthâ€™s crust in which rocks of Precambrian age (about 4 billion to 542 million years ago) were deposited in the Northern Rocky Mountain region. The rocks consist of limestones, shales, and sandstones and attain total thicknesses as great as 10,600 metres (35,000 feet). Beltian rocks are exposed in Glacier National Park and in the Little Belt Mountains of Montana, from which the name is derived.
