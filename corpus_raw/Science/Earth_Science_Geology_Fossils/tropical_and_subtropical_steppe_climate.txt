Tropical and subtropical steppe climate,  major climate type of the Köppen classification that occurs primarily on the periphery of the true deserts in low-latitude semiarid steppe regions. Such regions are denoted by the abbreviation BSh in the Köppen-Geiger-Pohl system.
It is transitional to the tropical wet-dry climate on the equatorward side (showing a summer rainfall maximum associated with the intertropical convergence zone and a small annual temperature range) and to the mediterranean climate on its poleward margin (with a cooler, wetter winter resulting from the higher latitude and mid-latitude frontal cyclone activity). Annual precipitation totals are greater than in tropical and subtropical desert climates (38–63 cm [15–25 inches]). Yearly variations in amount are not as extreme as in the true deserts but are nevertheless large.
