Paleontology, also spelled palaeontology,  scientific study of life of the geologic past that involves the analysis of plant and animal fossils, including those of microscopic size, preserved in rocks. It is concerned with all aspects of the biology of ancient life forms: their shape and structure, evolutionary patterns, taxonomic relationships with each other and with modern living species, geographic distribution, and interrelationships with the environment. Paleontology is mutually interdependent with stratigraphy and historical geology because fossils constitute a major means by which sedimentary strata are identified and correlated with one another. Its methods of investigation include that of biometry (statistical analysis applied to biology), which is designed to provide a description of the forms of organisms statistically and the expression of taxonomic relationships quantitatively.
Paleontology has played a key role in reconstructing Earthâ€™s history and has provided much evidence to support the theory of evolution. Data from paleontological studies, moreover, have aided petroleum geologists in locating deposits of oil and natural gas. The occurrence of such fossil fuels is frequently associated with the presence of the remains of certain ancient life-forms.
Paleontological research dates back to the early 1800s. In 1815 the English geologist William Smith demonstrated the value of using fossils for the study of strata. About the same time, the French zoologist Georges Cuvier initiated comparative studies of the structure of living animals with fossil remains.
