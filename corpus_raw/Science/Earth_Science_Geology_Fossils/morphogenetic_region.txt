Morphogenetic region,   theoretical area devised by geomorphologists to relate climate, geomorphic processes, and landforms. Morphogenetic classification was first proposed by Julius BÃ¼del, the German geographer, in 1945. The morphogenetic concept asserts that, under a particular climatic regime, certain geomorphic processes will predominate and produce a characteristic topographic expression. Proponents of the concept say that climatic controls outweigh rock type as a landform factor because the resistance of a rock type to erosion is dependent on the climate to which it is subjected. Present knowledge, however, indicates that landforms result from the interaction of climate, rock type, and physical processes.
