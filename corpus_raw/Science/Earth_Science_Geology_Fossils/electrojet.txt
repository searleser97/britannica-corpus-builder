Electrojet,  streaming movement of charged particles in the lower ionosphere. The term is limited by some to those flow patterns that contain a significant proportion of neutral gases, but highly concentrated, laterally limited, electric currents are also called electrojets. The latter circulate within the ionosphere at heights of 80 to 100 km (50 to 60 miles).
The equatorial electrojet is a permanent feature of the ionosphere in the lower latitudes that follows the magnetic dipole equator (a region where Earth’s magnetic field is horizontal to Earth’s surface). In contrast, auroral electrojets are associated with auroras and other magnetic disturbances; they complete their circuits in high latitudes that span the polar caps. See aurora.
