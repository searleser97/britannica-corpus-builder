Violet,  in physics, light in the wavelength range of 380–450 nanometres in the visible spectrum. The shortest wavelength of violet is the shortest of all wavelengths of light discernible to the human eye.  In art, violet is a colour on the conventional wheel, located between red and blue and opposite yellow, its complement. Pigments for violet come from berries, cobalt phosphate or cobalt arsenate, carminic acid, kermesic acid, manganese, and artificial chemical compounds.
Violet is a basic colour term added late to languages. The word violet derives from Old French violet or violete. One of the first written records of the term in English is from The Buke of John Maundeuill (mid-14th century): “Men fynd dyamaundz of violet colour” (“Men find diamonds of violet colour”).
In addition to the colour wheel, various other colour systems have been used to classify violet. Before the invention of colour photography, Werner’s Nomenclature of Colour (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint “Violet Purple” is compared to the “Purple Aster” and the “Amethyst.” In the Munsell colour system—adopted in the early 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry—one of the many variations of violet is identified as 10PB 7/12.
