Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, also called Maxwell distribution,  a description of the statistical distribution of the energies of the molecules of a classical gas. This distribution was first set forth by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1859, on the basis of probabilistic arguments, and gave the distribution of velocities among the molecules of a gas. Maxwell’s finding was generalized (1871) by German physicist Ludwig Boltzmann to express the distribution of energies among the molecules.
The distribution function for a gas obeying Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics ( fM–B) can be written in terms of the total energy (E) of the system of particles described by the distribution, the absolute temperature (T) of the gas, the Boltzmann constant (k = 1.38 × 10−16 erg per kelvin), and a normalizing constant (C) chosen so that the sum, or integral, of all probabilities is 1—i.e.,fM–B = Ce−E/kT, in which e is the base of the natural logarithms. The distribution function implies that the probability dP that any individual molecule has an energy between E and E + dE is given by dP = fM–BdE. The total energy (E) usually is composed of several individual parts, each corresponding to a different degree of freedom of the system. In fact, the total energy is divided equally between these modes. See energy, equipartition of.
The law can be derived in several ways, none of which is absolutely rigorous. All systems observed to date appear to obey Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics provided that quantum-mechanical effects are not important.
