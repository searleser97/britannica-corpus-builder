Filter,   in photography, device used to selectively modify the component wavelengths of mixed (e.g., white) light before it strikes the film. Filters may be made of coloured glass, plastic, gelatin, or sometimes a coloured liquid in a glass cell. They are most often placed over the camera lens but can in some cases be placed over the light source with the same effect.
Black-and-white films are imperfect in their colour sensitivity, and coloured filters are used to modify the light and translate the subject into gray tones that correspond to the tones seen by the human eye. Coloured filters can also brighten or darken the reproduction of coloured objects, permitting local contrast controls at the point of exposure. In colour photography, coloured filters are used to alter the colour quality of the light to match the colour sensitivity of the film.
Some light filters are used in both colour and black-and-white photography. Neutral density filters decrease the intensity of the light without affecting its colour and are used when the light intensity is too great for the correct exposure. Polarizing filters enhance colour vividness by reducing glare from the reflecting surfaces of such substances as glass and water. Colour filters are also used for colour correction in the printing process and for selecting contrast scales of multicontrast black-and-white enlarging paper.
Since filters absorb some of the light that passes through them, an increase in the calculated exposure is usually required. This increase is known as the filter factor. Modern cameras with built-in meters measure the light after the filtration and thus take the decrease in intensity into account.
