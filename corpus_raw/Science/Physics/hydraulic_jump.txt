Hydraulic jump,  Sudden change in water level, analogous to a shock wave, commonly seen below weirs and sluice gates where a smooth stream of water suddenly rises at a foaming front. The fact that the speed of water waves varies with wavelength and with amplitude leads to a wide variety of effects. Tidal bores, which may be observed on some estuaries, are large-scale examples. See also Bernoulliâ€™s principle.
