Black,  in physics, what is perceived with the human eye when light is absent or when all wavelengths in the visible spectrum are absorbed. Like white, but unlike the colours of the spectrum or most mixtures of them, black lacks hue, so it is considered an achromatic colour.
Black and white are the most basic colour terms of languages. The word black derives from Proto-Germanic blakaz and Old English blæc. One of the first written records of the term is from an Old English translation (c. 890 ce) of St. Bede the Venerable’s Historia ecclesiastica: “He hæfde blæc feax” (“He had black hair”).
Pigments for black come from carbon, especially that obtained from burnt vines or bones, or from artificial chemical compounds. Traditional black ink from China, often called India ink, is usually made from soot mixed with animal glue; it is highly prized for its durability and opacity.
In addition to the gray scale, various colour systems have been used to classify black. Before the invention of colour photography, Werner’s Nomenclature of Colour (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint “Raven Black” is compared to the “Berry of Deadly Night-Shade” and “Oliven Ore.” In the Munsell colour system—adopted in the early 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry—absolute black has a value of 0.
