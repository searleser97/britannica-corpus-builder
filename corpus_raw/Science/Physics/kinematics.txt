Kinematics,  branch of physics and a subdivision of classical mechanics concerned with the geometrically possible motion of a body or system of bodies without consideration of the forces involved (i.e., causes and effects of the motions).
A brief treatment of kinematics follows. For full treatment, see mechanics.
Kinematics aims to provide a description of the spatial position of bodies or systems of material particles, the rate at which the particles are moving (velocity), and the rate at which their velocity is changing (acceleration). When the causative forces are disregarded, motion descriptions are possible only for particles having constrained motionâ€”i.e., moving on determinate paths. In unconstrained, or free, motion, the forces determine the shape of the path.
For a particle moving on a straight path, a list of positions and corresponding times would constitute a suitable scheme for describing the motion of the particle. A continuous description would require a mathematical formula expressing position in terms of time.
When a particle moves on a curved path, a description of its position becomes more complicated and requires two or three dimensions. In such cases continuous descriptions in the form of a single graph or mathematical formula are not feasible. The position of a particle moving on a circle, for example, can be described by a rotating radius of the circle, like the spoke of a wheel with one end fixed at the centre of the circle and the other end attached to the particle. The rotating radius is known as a position vector for the particle, and, if the angle between it and a fixed radius is known as a function of time, the magnitude of the velocity and acceleration of the particle can be calculated. Velocity and acceleration, however, have direction as well as magnitude; velocity is always tangent to the path, while acceleration has two components, one tangent to the path and the other perpendicular to the tangent.
