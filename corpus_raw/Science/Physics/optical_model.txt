Optical model,   in physics, description of atomic nuclei as similar to cloudy crystal balls in that, when struck by a beam of particles, they partially absorb the beam, partially scatter it, and partially transmit it in a way analogous to the behaviour of light. The nuclear optical model has proved very successful in explaining nuclear reactions in which the incident (striking) particles have energies of about 106 to 109 electron volts.
