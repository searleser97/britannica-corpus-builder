Orange,  in physics, light in the wavelength range of 585–620 nanometres in the visible spectrum. After the wavelengths of red, those of orange are the longest discernible to the human eye. In art, orange is a colour on the conventional wheel, located between red and yellow and opposite blue, its complement. Pigments for orange have come from lead chromate, madder, realgar from arsenic sulfide, and artificial chemical compounds.
Orange is a basic colour term added to languages late in their construction. The word orange derives from Sanskrit nāraṅga, Spanish naranja, Medieval Latin arantia or arangia, and Old French orenge. One of the first written records of the word in English is from an English statute on the manufacture and sale of woolen cloth (1557–58).
In addition to the colour wheel, various other colour systems have been used to classify orange. Before the invention of colour photography, Werner’s Nomenclature of Colour (1814) was frequently used by scientists attempting to accurately describe colours observed in nature. In that book the so-called tint “Orpiment Orange” is compared to the “Belly of the Warty Newt” and “Indian Cress.” In the Munsell colour system—adopted in the early 20th century to standardize colour, usually for industry—one of the many variations of orange is identified as 2.5YR 6/16.
