White noise,  in music, the effect of the complete range of audible sound-wave frequencies heard simultaneously, analogous to white light, which contains all the frequencies of the light spectrum. The sound of cymbals and snare drums has white-noise characteristics. Electronically synthesized white noise can be filtered so as to produce combinations of frequencies not obtainable on traditional musical instruments; or the white noise itself may be used as an element of music.
White noise is aperiodic sound (that is, its wave pattern is not repetitive) and consists of equal intensities of all frequencies of the audible spectrum.
