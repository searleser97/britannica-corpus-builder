X-ray microscope,  instrument that uses X-rays to produce enlarged images of small objects. The basic device uses the emission of X-rays from a point source to cast an enlarged image on a phosphor screen. A successful X-ray microscope was made in 1951 by British physicists Ellis Coslett and William Nixon. It was the first such instrument whose resolution was comparable to that of an optical microscope and was hailed as a means of examining hidden structures in rocks, metals, bone, teeth, ores, and wood. After decades in abeyance, interest is once more being shown in the capacities of the X-ray microscope. There is particular interest in soft X-rays with an energy of 100â€“1,000 electron volts, equivalent to a wavelength down to 1 nanometre (one- billionth of a metre), as opposed to about 500 nanometres for green light. Biological specimens, polymers, soil, and geological samples have been studied using modern X-ray techniques. The fact that X-ray microscopy can lead to higher resolution than can the best optical microscope is adding impetus to this field of research.
