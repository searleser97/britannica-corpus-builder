Niklaus Emil Wirth,  (born Feb. 15, 1934, Winterthur, Switz.), Swiss computer scientist and winner of the 1984 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for “developing a sequence of innovative computer languages, EULER, ALGOL-W, MODULA and PASCAL.”
Wirth earned a bachelor’s degree (1959) in electronics engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), a master’s degree (1960) in electronics engineering from Laval University, in Quebec city, and a doctorate (1963) in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley.
After leaving Berkeley, Wirth held a professorship in the newly created computer science department at Stanford University (1963–67) before returning to Switzerland. Following a short stay at the University of Zürich, in 1968 Wirth accepted a professorship in informatics at ETH, where he tried for years to establish an independent computer science department before succeeding in 1981. Except for a two-year sabbatical at Xerox PARC (1976–77), a research facility in California, Wirth remained at ETH until his retirement in 1999.
In addition to his development of important computer programming languages, especially PASCAL, Wirth led the design and development of the Lilith and Oberon operating systems at ETH. Inspiration for these systems came from his sabbatical at Xerox PARC, where he had used an experimental workstation computer that included a personal monitor and a computer mouse.
Wirth wrote more than a dozen books on computer science. Among his more noteworthy titles are Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs (1975), Algorithms & Data Structures (1986), Digital Circuit Design (1995), and Compiler Construction (1996).
In addition to the Turing Award, Wirth received an IEEE Computer Pioneer Award (1988) and an IBM Europe Science and Technology Prize (1988). He was elected to the Swiss Academy of Engineering (1992) and the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (1994).
