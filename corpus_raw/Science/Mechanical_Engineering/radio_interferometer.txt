Radio interferometer,   apparatus consisting of two or more separate antennas that receive radio waves from the same astronomical object and are joined to the same receiver. The antennas may be placed close together or thousands of kilometres apart. (Using the Japanese VSOP satellite together with ground-based telescopes, the largest interferometer baselines have been up to 33,000 km [21,000 miles]).The principle of a radio interferometerâ€™s operation is the same as for an optical interferometer, but, because radio waves are much longer than light waves, the scale of the instrument is generally correspondingly greater. Parts of a radio wave reach the spaced antennas at different times. This time difference is compensated for by a variable-delay mechanism, and the waves can be made to interfere, much as in the optical interferometer. In another version, the spacing of the antennas can be changed in an attempt to make the waves interfere; the distance between them for interference depends on the wavelength and on the diameter of the source of the waves. The diameter can be calculated when the other quantities are known. If the diameter of the radio-wave source is not too small to be resolved by the interferometer, the radio signals will alternately reinforce and cancel each other in a manner analogous to the way fringes are produced in the optical interferometer.
The most powerful radio interferometer, in its combination of sensitivity, resolution, and versatility, is the U.S. Very Large Array (VLA) located on the Plains of San Agustin near Socorro, in central New Mexico. The VLA consists of 27 parabolic antennas, each measuring 25 metres (82 feet) in diameter. The total collecting area is equivalent to a single 130-metre (430-foot) antenna. However, the angular resolution is equivalent to a single antenna 36 km (22 miles) in diameter.
