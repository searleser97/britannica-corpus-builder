Viscaceae,  one of the mistletoe families of flowering plants of the sandalwood order (Santalales), including about 11 genera and more than 450 species of semiparasitic shrubs. This family is sometimes considered a subfamily of the sandalwood family (Santalaceae).
Members of the Viscaceae are primarily tropical in distribution and are parasites on the branches of many tree species. The leaves are usually attached in pairs, one leaf opposite the other on the branch; they have parallel veins. Many species have scalelike leaves. The unisexual flowers are tiny, and the fruit is a one-seeded berry, the seed being covered with a sticky substance. The European mistletoe (Viscum album) and the North American oak mistletoe (Phoradendron) and dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium) are well-known members of the family.
