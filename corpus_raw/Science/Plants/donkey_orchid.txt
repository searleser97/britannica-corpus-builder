Donkey orchid,  (genus Diuris),  genus of about 60 species of terrestrial orchids (family Orchidaceae). One species is found in Java and Timor, and the others are native to Australia. The common donkey orchid (Diuris longifolia) bears three to five purplish flowers about 4 cm (1.5 inches) long. Other well-known species are catâ€™s face (D. filifolia) and nanny-goat orchid (D. laevis).
Donkey orchids are deciduous perennials and have grasslike leaves. The two upper petals on each flower resemble the ears of a donkey, and the greenish lateral sepals are long and drooping. The fruit is a dry capsule and bears winged seeds.
