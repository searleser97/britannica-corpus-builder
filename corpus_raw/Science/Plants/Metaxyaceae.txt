Metaxyaceae,  small family of ferns in the division Pteridophyta (the lower vascular plants). The single genus, Metaxya, contains two species, M. rostrata and M. lanosa. M. rostrata is widespread in Neotropical mountains from southern Mexico to Bolivia and Brazil. It also occurs on some islands, including Trinidad and Guadeloupe. M. rostrata is terrestrial and has a stout creeping rhizome that is densely hairy but totally lacking in scales. The leaves, which can reach 2.5 metres (8 feet) in length, are pinnately compound, with large leaflets having many parallel secondary veins. The round sori are scattered along the veins and lack a protective flap of tissue (indusium). The spores are globose (tetrahedral) and have a granular surface. M. lanosa is found in the Amazon region of South America. It differs from M. rostrata in its woolly stipes, broader pinnae, and longer pinna stalks. Molecular studies comparing gene sequences among tree ferns suggest that Metaxyaceae should be considered a primitive relative of the tree ferns (Cyatheaceae).
