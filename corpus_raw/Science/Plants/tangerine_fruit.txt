Tangerine,  (Citrus reticulata),  small thin-skinned variety of orange belonging to the mandarin orange species of the family Rutaceae. Probably indigenous to Southeast Asia, tangerine culture spread westward along trade routes as far as the Mediterranean. The fruit is cultivated in the subtropical regions of both the Old World and the New World, especially in southern Europe and the southern United States. The tender, juicy, richly flavoured pulp is abundant in vitamin C. Oil extracted from the fragrant skin of the tangerine is a characteristic ingredient in several flavourings and liqueurs.
The tangerine tree is smaller than other orange trees. It bears slender twigs and glossy lance-shaped evergreen leaves. The white five-petalled flowers are fragrant. The fruit is slightly flattened at either end and has a loose reddish orange peel and easily separated segments. Some varieties ship well, and those marketed commercially include Minneola, Orlando, Dancy, and Seminole.
Tangerines have been crossed with grapefruit (Citrus ×paradisi) to produce tangelos (C. ×tangelo).
