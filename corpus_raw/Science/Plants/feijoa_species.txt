Feijoa,  (Acca sellowiana), also called pineapple guava or guavasteen,  small evergreen tree of the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), related to the guava. It is native to southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and parts of Argentina and is cultivated in mild dry climates for its sweet fruit. The feijoa was introduced into southern Europe in 1890 and into California about 1900. The fruits can be eaten fresh and are made into jam and jelly and also crystallized. The tree is grown as an ornamental in some places.
The tree is about 5 metres (15 feet) high and has olivelike leaves, dark green above and silvery beneath. The large white flowers have purplish crimson interiors. The oblong fruit is approximately 5 cm (2 inches) long and dull green in colour, marked with crimson. It has a translucent, tender pulp with a pineapple-like flavour. The fruits fall when mature but must be kept in a cool place until soft enough to eat. Feijoas are propagated by seeds, cuttings, whip grafting, and layering of low branches.
