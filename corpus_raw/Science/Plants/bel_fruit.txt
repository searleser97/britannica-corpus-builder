Bel fruit,  (Aegle marmelos), bel also spelled bael, also called Bengal quince,  tree of the family Rutaceae, cultivated for its fruit. The plant is native to India and Bangladesh and has naturalized throughout much of Southeast Asia. The unripe fruit, sliced and sun-dried, is traditionally used as a remedy for dysentery and other digestive ailments. The ripe fruit is sweet, aromatic, and cooling. The tree’s wood is yellowish white and hard but not durable.
The slow-growing trees bear strong spines and alternate compound leaves with three leaflets. The sweet-scented white flowers are borne in panicle clusters and are sometimes used in perfumes. The fruit is pyriform (pear-shaped) to oblong in shape and 5–25 cm (2–10 inches) in diameter. It has a very hard woody gray or yellow rind and sweet, thick, orange-coloured pulp.
