Muhly,  (genus Muhlenbergia),  genus of about 150 species of range grasses in the family Poaceae, native to North and South America. Some species are used for fodder. Bush muhly (Muhlenbergia porteri) is so palatable to browsing animals that it is rarely found where livestock has access to it. Several species, including pink muhlygrass, or hairawn muhly (M. capillaris), are grown as garden ornamentals.
Most muhlys are perennial plants. The genus is diverse: some species are less than 10 cm (4 inches) tall and bushy; others are highly branched and matlike; and still others can reach up to 1 metre (3.3 feet) in height and grow in tufts. All species have only one floret on each branch within a panicle (flower cluster). Additionally, members of the genus utilize a photosynthetic pathway known as C4 carbon fixation, which largely prevents photorespiration.
