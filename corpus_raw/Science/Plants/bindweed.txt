Bindweed,  plants of the closely related genera Convolvulus and Calystegia (morning glory family; Convolvulaceae), mostly twining, often weedy, and producing handsome white, pink, or blue funnel-shaped flowers.
Bellbine, or hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium), native to Eurasia and North America, bears arrow-shaped leaves and white to pink 5-cm (2-inch) flowers. This twining perennial grows from creeping underground stems and is common in hedges and woods and along roadsides. Its range tends to coincide with that of its principal pollinator, the hawk moth. Seashore false bindweed (Calystegia soldanella), with fleshy kidney-shaped leaves and deep pink 5-cm blooms, creeps along European seaside sand and gravel.
Several Convolvulus species are widespread or conspicuous. The weedy perennial field bindweed (C. arvensis) is native to Europe but is widely naturalized in North America and twines around crop plants and along roadsides. It bears long-stalked clusters of fragrant pink, white, or striped blooms 2 cm across among arrow-shaped leaves. Scammony, a purgative, is derived from the rhizomes of C. scammonia, a trailing perennial with white to pink flowers, native in western Asia.
