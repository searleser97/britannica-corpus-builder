Kiwi,  (Actinidia deliciosa), also called kiwifruit or Chinese gooseberry,  woody vine and edible fruit of the family Actinidiaceae. The plant is native to mainland China and Taiwan and is also grown commercially in New Zealand and California. The fruit has a slightly acid taste and can be eaten raw or cooked. The juice is sometimes used as a meat tenderizer. Raw kiwis are high in vitamins C and K.
Kiwi vines are dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are borne on separate individuals. Generally, one male plant can facilitate the pollination of three to eight female plants. The ellipsoidal kiwi fruit is a true berry and has furry brownish green skin. The firm translucent green flesh has numerous edible purple-black seeds embedded around a white centre. The deciduous leaves are borne alternately on long petioles (leaf stems), and young leaves are covered with reddish hairs.
A number of other species are also grown for their fruits. Golden kiwi (Actinidia chinensis) has fewer hairs and yellower, sweeter flesh than A. deliciosa and is grown commercially in some places. Other kiwis include two cold-hardy species (A. arguta and A. kolomikta), Chinese egg gooseberry (A. coriacea), red kiwi (A. melanandra), silver vine (A. polygama), and purple kiwi (A. purpurea).
