Gaillardia,  genus of leafy, branching herbs of the family Asteraceae, native to North America. Several summer-blooming species are cultivated as garden ornamentals, especially blanketflower (G. aristata) and annual blanketflower (G. pulchella).
They have purple disk flowers and yellow, orange, or white ray flowers with three or more teeth that give the plant a fringed appearance. Most have hairy leaves that are either grouped at the base of the plant or alternate along the stem.
