Indonesia Botanical Gardens, Indonesian Kebun Raya Indonesia, byname Bogor Botanical Gardens,  tropical garden in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia. It is renowned for its research on regional flora.
The 215-acre (87-hectare) site was first used by the Dutch for introducing tropical plants from other parts of the world into the region. In 1817 it was converted into a botanical garden and served as a training ground for specialists in tropical botany. A large area of the original rainforest on which the garden was founded has been preserved in its natural state, providing excellent specimens for scientific study. The garden also has outstanding collections of palms, bamboos, cacti, orchids, and ornamental trees. It administers three other large gardens: the Cibodas Botanical Garden (founded 1862) in West Java, the Purwodadi Botanical Garden in East Java, and the Eka Karya Botanical Garden (1959) on the island of Bali.
The grounds of the Kebun Raya are adjacent to a luxurious palace that is an occasional residence of the Indonesian president.
