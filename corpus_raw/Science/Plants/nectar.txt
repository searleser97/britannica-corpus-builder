Nectar,  sweet viscous secretion from the nectaries, or glands, in plant blossoms, stems, and leaves. Nectar is mainly a watery solution of the sugars fructose, glucose, and sucrose but also contains traces of proteins, salts, acids, and essential oils. Sugar content varies from 3 to 80 percent, depending upon such factors as plant species and soil and air conditions. The production of nectar as a food reward for animals is a classic example of coevolution.
Nectar in flowers serves chiefly to attract pollinators, such as fruit-eating bats, hummingbirds, sunbirds, and insects. Nectaries are usually located at the base of the flower stamens, which draw animal visitors into contact with the pollen to be transferred. Most flowers secrete only relatively small amounts of nectar, which encourages cross-pollination, since animals must visit several flowers in order to receive a full meal. Some insects, known generally as nectar robbers, bypass the sexual organs of the flowers to obtain nectar, often by penetrating the outside of the flower rather than entering it. In this way, nectar robbers “steal” the nectar reward without facilitating pollination.
In addition to being directly consumed as food, nectar is also the raw material used by honeybees to produce honey. Honeybees gather nectar mainly from the blossoms and rarely gather nectars having less than 15 percent sugar content. At least one plant species, Oenothera drummondii, can increase the sugar content of its nectar within three minutes of the flower being vibrated by buzzing bees.
The nectar on vegetative plant structures can serve to attract animals that defend the plant. For example, members of the genus Costus attract nectar-eating ants that then protect the plants from herbivorous insects. Conversely, many species of carnivorous pitcher plants use nectar in their traps to attract prey to their deaths.
In Greek mythology, nectar is the drink of the gods.
