willow,  shrubs and trees of the genus Salix, family Salicaceae, mostly native to north temperate areas and valued for ornament, shade, erosion control, and timber. Salicin, source of salicylic acid used in pain relievers, is derived from certain willows. All species have alternate, usually narrow leaves and catkins, male and female on separate trees; the seeds have long, silky hairs.
Three of the largest willows are black (S. nigra), crack, or brittle (S. fragilis), and white (S. alba), all reaching 20 metres (65 feet) or more; the first named is North American, the other two Eurasian but naturalized widely. All are common in lowland situations.
Widespread from Mexico to Chile, the Chilean willow (S. chilensis) reaches 18 metres; the columnar Xochimilco willow (S. chilensis fastigiata) is a variety especially common at Xochimilco near Mexico City.
The shrubby common, or silky, osier (S. viminalis) supplies twigs used for basket making in Europe. Woolly willow (S. lanata), of northern Eurasia, grows to over 1 metre and has woolly white leaf buds.
Several species and hybrids with drooping habit are called weeping willows, especially S. babylonica and its varieties from East Asia. From northern Asia, S. matsudana has sharply toothed leaves, whitish beneath. One variety, S. matsudana tortuosa, is called corkscrew willow for its twisted branches.
Pussy willows, the male form of several shrubby species, have woolly catkins that are considered a harbinger of spring. The catkins are formed before the leaves appear. The North American S. discolor is slightly smaller than the Eurasian species, which attain a maximum height of 7.5 metres.
There are numerous shrubby willows common along watercourses (e.g., S. purpurea and S. sericea), and several range to the tundra, where they grow as small matted woody plants (e.g., S. arctica and S. glacialis).
