Chicory,  (Cichorium intybus),  blue-flowered perennial plant of the family Asteraceae. Native to Europe and introduced into the United States late in the 19th century, chicory is cultivated extensively in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Germany and to some extent in North America. Its leaves are eaten as a vegetable or in a salad, and the roots may be boiled and eaten with butter. The plant is grown as a fodder or herbage crop for cattle. Chicory root can be roasted and ground to impart additional colour, body, and bitterness to coffee; in the United States this practice is especially popular in the city of New Orleans.
Chicory has a long fleshy taproot and a rigid, branching, hairy stem that grows to a height of about 1 to 1.5 metres (3 to 5 feet). Its lobed toothed leaves, in wild chicory similar in appearance to dandelion leaves, are borne around the base. The roots of some varieties are grown in the open during the summer and are taken up in the fall to be forced, or grown indoors out of season, during the winter. One method of forcing produces barbe de capucin, the loose blanched leaves much esteemed by the French as a winter salad. Another method produces witloef, or witloof, the tighter heads or crowns preferred in Belgium and elsewhere. Throughout Europe the roots are stored to produce leaves for salads during winter.
In temperate regions having a growing season of five and a half to six months, if the seed is sown too early in the spring, the plants may go to seed instead of forming large storage roots suitable for forcing; in such areas seed should be sown in June. The roots may be forced in cellars, under greenhouse benches, or outdoors.
