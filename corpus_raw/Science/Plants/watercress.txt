Watercress,  (Nasturtium officinale), also called cress,  perennial aquatic plant of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), native to Eurasia and naturalized throughout North America. Watercress thrives in cool flowing streams, where it grows submerged, floating on the water, or spread over mud surfaces. It is often cultivated in tanks or moist soil for its edible young shoots and delicate peppery-flavoured leaves, which are rich in vitamin C. The garden ornamental nasturtium (genus Tropaeolum) is not closely related to watercress.
Watercress plants often form bushy colonies and root freely from the stems. The alternate leaves are pinnately compound with three to nine leaflets. The plant bears compact clusters of tiny four-petaled white flowers; each seedpod, known as a silique, bears two rows of seeds.
