Saltbush,  (genus Atriplex),  genus of about 300 species of herbs and shrubs in the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae), often found on saline soils. Saltbush plants grow throughout temperate and subtropical areas of the world. Young leaves of several species, including the garden orach (A. hortensis), are eaten fresh or cooked like spinach. Several species are common salt-tolerant shrubs of western North America, especially four-wing saltbush, or chamiso (A. canescens), and spiny saltbush (A. confertifolia).
Saltbushes are annuals or perennials. The leaves can be lobed, entire, or toothed and are arranged alternately or oppositely along the stems. The leaves of some species are white and look scurfy or mealy. The small flowers can be bisexual or unisexual and are usually borne in spikelike clusters.
