Hieronymus Bock, in full Hieronymus Tragus Bock,  (born 1498, Heidersbach, Germany—died February 21, 1554, Hornbach), German priest, physician, and botanist who helped lead the transition from the philological scholasticism of medieval botany to the modern science based on observation and description from nature.
Little is known of Bock’s life and career. He worked from 1523 to 1533 in Zweibrücken and then accepted a canonry in Hornbach. He became a follower of Martin Luther and was forced to leave Hornbach in 1550. He then served briefly as personal physician to the duke of Nassau, returning to Hornbach in 1551.
Bock’s major work, the New Kreuterbuch (1539), broke from the past by providing detailed descriptions and (in the 1546 edition) careful illustrations of approximately 700 plants, which he classified on the basis of structural similarity.
