Ericaceae,  the heath family of flowering plants (order Ericales), comprising 126 genera and some 4,000 species. Ericaceae is made up mostly of shrubs and small trees, and its members are widely distributed, extending into the subarctic and along mountain chains through the tropics. A large percentage of the familyâ€™s species are cultivated, including azaleas, rhododendrons, mountain laurel, blueberries, and the low shrubs of the genus Erica.
Members of the family are often evergreen species that thrive on open barren land with usually acid poorly drained soils. The simple leaves are usually oppositely arranged along the stem and can be toothed or entire. The flowers are solitary or borne in clusters and typically feature 5 petals, 5 sepals, and 10 stamens (male parts). The fruits are berries, capsules, or drupes, depending on the species.
