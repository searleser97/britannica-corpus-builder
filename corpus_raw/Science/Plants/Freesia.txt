Freesia,  (genus Freesia),  genus of about 20 species perennial plants of the iris family (Iridaceae) native to southern Africa. The plants are grown indoors in pots or in gardens in mild climates, and the cut flowers are important in the floral industry.
Freesia plants have grassy foliage that arises from underground corms (bulblike structures). They bear wiry spikes of lemon-scented flowers in white, yellow, orange, and blue. The approximately 60-centimetre- (2-foot-) tall flower spikes usually turn at right angles from the stem, displaying the flowers in a horizontal line or gentle arch.
Two species much used in hybridization are Freesia refracta, greenish yellow to yellow or white, and F. armstrongii, tinged rose-purple. Flowering grass (F. laxa) bears flowers in a range of colours and is grown as a garden ornamental.
