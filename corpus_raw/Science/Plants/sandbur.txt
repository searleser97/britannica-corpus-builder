Sandbur,  (genus Cenchrus), also called sandspur or buffelgrass,  genus of about 20 to 25 species of grasses in the family Poaceae. Sandburs are native to warm sandy areas of North America, North Africa, Asia, Europe, and the South Pacific. The plants can be used for forage when young, but they later form rounded sharp-spined burs that can catch on the coats of or scratch the faces of grazing animals.
Sandburs are weedy annuals or perennials, typically less than 100 cm (40 inches) tall. The plants are usually shallow-rooted and spread readily. The leaf blades are generally somewhat twisted and feature a fringed ligule (small appendage) at the leaf base. Sandbur flower spikelets are enclosed in sharp burs that readily detach from the plant when ripe.
