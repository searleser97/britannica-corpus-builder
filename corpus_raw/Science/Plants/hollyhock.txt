Hollyhock,  (Alcea rosea),  herbaceous plant of the hibiscus, or mallow, family (Malvaceae), native to China but widely cultivated for its handsome flowers. The several varieties include annual, biennial, and perennial forms. The plant grows almost absolutely straight for about 1.5–2.7 metres (5–9 feet), with the flowers borne along the stem. The leaves have five to seven lobes. Commonly white, pink, red, or yellow, the flowers are 7.5 cm (3 inches) or more across and are borne along the upper portion of the stem. The plants readily reseed and are considered invasive species in some areas outside their native range.
