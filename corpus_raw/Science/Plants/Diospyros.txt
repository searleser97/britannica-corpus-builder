Diospyros,  genus of some 500 species of trees and shrubs of the family Ebenaceae, most of which are native to the tropics. Some members of the genus are valuable for their timber, particularly several species of ebony. Others are cultivated for their handsome foliage or edible fruit.
Members of the genus are either deciduous or evergreen. The leaves, which lack teeth, are usually borne alternately on opposite sides of the twig. The plants are generally dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are borne on separate individuals. The sepals of the female flowers often persist on the fruit, which is a large juicy berry with 1 to 10 seeds.
Chief among the fruit-producing members are the persimmons. The two commercially important species are the common, or American, persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), native to North America, and the Japanese, or kaki, persimmon (D. kaki), native to China but widely cultivated in other temperate regions. The globular orange fruit of the common persimmon is about 4 cm (1.5 inches) in diameter. The tree grows about 10 to 12 metres (33 to 40 feet) tall and bears yellowish white bell-shaped flowers. The Japanese persimmon grows 12 metres (39 feet) tall or more and bears yellowish white flowers and orange-red fruit about 7.5 cm (3 inches) in diameter. Several hundred varieties of persimmons have been developed.
Other fruit species include the date plum (D. lotus), the black sapote (D. nigra), and the mabolo (D. blancoi), the last being cultivated for its tasty fruit, which is dark red to purple.
The best Indian and Ceylon ebony is produced by D. ebenum. Because of its dark colour, durability, hardness, and ability to take a high polish, ebony is used for cabinetwork and inlaying, piano keys, knife handles, and turned articles. Various other members of the genus also are sources of ebony wood.
