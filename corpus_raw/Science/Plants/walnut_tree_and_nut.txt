walnut,  (genus Juglans),  genus of about 20 species of deciduous trees of the family Juglandaceae, native to North and South America, southern Europe, Asia, and the West Indies.
Walnut trees have long compound leaves with 5 to 23 short-stalked leaflets. The male and female reproductive organs are borne in different petal-less flower clusters, known as catkins, on the same tree. The twigs characteristically contain a many-chambered pith. The fruit is not a true botanical nut: it is a drupe with the edible seed (commonly called a nut) enclosed in a shell within a thick husk.
Black walnut (Juglans nigra) of eastern North America and English, or Persian, walnut (J. regia), native to Iran, are valuable timber trees that produce edible walnuts. The butternut (J. cinerea) of eastern North America also produces an edible nutlike seed.
The English walnut is grown in parts of North and South America for commercial nut production. A tree produces fine-quality walnuts only on fertile well-drained soils of medium-heavy texture. The round-tipped leaflets have smooth margins, and the terminal leaflet is the largest. The leaflets of native North American walnuts are largest toward the centre of the leaf and have toothed margins.
The dark fine-grained wood of English and black walnuts is used for furniture, paneling, and gunstocks.
