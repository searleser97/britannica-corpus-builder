Walking fern,  fern that is a member either of the species Asplenium rhizophyllum, of eastern North America, or of A. sibiricum, of eastern Asia, in the family Aspleniaceae. The common name derives from the fact that new plantlets sprout wherever the tips of parent plant’s arching leaves touch the ground. The plant’s leaves are evergreen, undivided, and slightly leathery; they are triangular in shape, tapering to a thin point. Spore-bearing structures are in clusters along the veins. Walking ferns are hardy plants that inhabit shady areas of limestone ledges and limey wooded areas.
