Winteraceae,  family of aromatic trees and shrubs in the order Canellales, containing 9 genera and 120 species. Most species are native to Southeast Asia and Australasia.
Members of the family have wood without water-conducting cells and produce acrid sap. The leathery leaves are gland-dotted and typically feature smooth margins. The small, usually bisexual flowers are borne in clusters. They have two to six sepals, petals in two or more series, several stamens, and one to several carpels (structure units of the female flower parts). The leaves of many Winteraceae have a peppery taste, which discourages browsing animals.
Many species have medicinal qualities. The best known is the South American Winter’s bark (Drimys winteri), a 15-metre (50-foot) tree with hot-tasting leaves and bark. The bark was formerly used as a preventive against scurvy. Winter’s bark has leathery elliptic-shaped leaves; red-tinged shoots; and jasmine-scented, cream-coloured, 8- to 12-petaled, 2.5-cm (1-inch) flowers in clusters. A closely related Central American species with similar medicinal attributes, D. granadensis, is the only North American member of the family.
Pseudowintera colorata, of New Zealand, has peppery, elliptic, red-blotched leaves on a 10-metre (32-foot) tree. Other genera of the family are Takhtajania and Zygogynum.
