horehound,  (Marrubium vulgare), also spelled hoarhound, also called white horehound,  bitter perennial herb of the mint family (Lamiaceae), native to Europe, North Africa, and Central Asia. The plant has naturalized throughout much of North and South America and is considered an invasive species in parts of Australia and New Zealand. The leaves and flowering tops are used as flavouring for beverages and candies, and infusions or extracts of horehound in the form of syrups, teas, or lozenges are sometimes used in herbal remedies for coughs and minor pulmonary disturbances.
The horehound plant is coarse, strongly aromatic, and less than 1 metre (3 feet) tall with square stems. Its blunt-toothed broad wrinkled leaves are woolly white below and pale green and downy above. The flowers are small, whitish, and densely clustered in axillary whorls. The plant is drought-tolerant and can thrive in poor soils.
Black horehound (Ballota nigra), a hairy perennial herb with a fetid odour, belongs to the same family. It has purplish flowers and lacks the woolly white appearance of white horehound. It is sometimes used to adulterate extracts of white horehound. It is native to the same regions as white horehound and is considered an invasive species in some parts of North America.
