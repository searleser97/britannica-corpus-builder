snapdragon,  (genus Antirrhinum),  genus of about 20 species of herbaceous plants in the family Plantaginaceae, native to western North America and the western Mediterranean region. The common snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) is a popular garden plant and is used in the floral industry; many horticultural varieties exist. The taxonomy of the group is contentious.
Snapdragons are mostly short-lived perennial plants, though some species are annuals. The simple leaves are usually lance-shaped. The flowers are tubular, bilaterally symmetrical, and usually large with a closed liplike mouth that excludes most insects but can be forced open by strong bees, the main pollinators. The flowers can be white, yellow, orange, red, pink, or lavender or combinations of those colours.
Showy greenbright (Gambelia speciosa), a related plant, is also called island snapdragon.
