Shepherd’s purse,  (Capsella bursa-pastoris),  plant of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Native to the Mediterranean region, shepherd’s purse has become naturalized worldwide and is a common lawn and roadside weed.
The plant is most conspicuous in the spring and is distinguished for its flat heart-shaped green fruits that are borne along the inflorescence stalks. The terminal clusters of tiny four-petaled flowers are white. Below the seeds are small arrow-shaped clasping stem leaves. The plants, which sometimes reach 45 cm (18 inches) in height, form a rosette of deeply cut or almost entire basal leaves.
