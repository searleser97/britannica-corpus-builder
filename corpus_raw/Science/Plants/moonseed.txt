Moonseed,  any of three species of woody vines constituting the genus Menispermum of the family Menispermaceae (order Ranunculales). They occur in East Asia, eastern North America, and Mexico. The North American species, Canada moonseed, or yellow parilla (M. canadense), with lobed leaves and greenish-white flowers, bears black, grapelike fruit with crescent-shaped seeds. M. dauricum, from East Asia, and M. mexicanum, from Mexico, have similar properties. In particular, the seeds of all these species may cause a curare-like poisoning; one of the ingredients in curare comes from another member of Menispermaceae (Chondrodendron tomentosum).
