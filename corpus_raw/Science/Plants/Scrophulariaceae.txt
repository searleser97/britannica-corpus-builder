Scrophulariaceae,  the figwort family of flowering plants, one of 26 in the order Lamiales, containing about 65 genera and 1,700 species with worldwide distribution. It contains no crop plants of great economic importance but is notable for many ornamental garden plants, such as  butterfly bush (Buddleja), Diascia, Nemesia, and many others. Some, such as the mullein (Verbascum), are troublesome weeds.
The family is characterized by bisexual flowers with tubular corollas (fused petals) that are bilaterally symmetrical (two-lipped) and have four stamens in most, two of which are usually shorter than the other two. The pistil is superior (i.e., positioned above the attachment point of the other flower parts) and usually two-celled.
