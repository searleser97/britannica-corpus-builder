Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg,  (born Nov. 15, 1871, Vienna, Austria—died Oct. 11, 1962, Vienna), Austrian botanist, one of the co-discoverers of Gregor Mendel’s classic papers on his experiments with the garden pea.
Tschermak interrupted his studies in Vienna to work at the Rotvorwerk Farm near Freiberg, Saxony. He completed his education at the University of Halle, receiving his doctorate in 1896. After working a few years at several seed-breeding establishments, he joined the staff of the Academy of Agriculture in Vienna in 1901. There he spent practically his entire teaching career, attaining the position of professor in 1906.
In the spring of 1898 Tschermak began breeding experiments on the garden pea in the Botanical Garden of Ghent. The next year he did volunteer work at the Imperial Family’s Foundation at Esslingen near Vienna and continued his experiments on peas in a private garden. While writing the results of his experiments, Tschermak saw a cross-reference to Mendel’s work and had the papers sent to him from the library of the University of Vienna. He found that Mendel’s work with the garden pea duplicated and in some ways superseded his own. In the same year (1900) that Tschermak reported his findings, Hugo de Vries and Carl Erich Correns also reported their discovery of Mendel’s papers.
An outstanding plant geneticist, Tschermak applied Mendel’s rules of heredity to the development of new plants such as Hanna-Kargyn barley, wheat-rye hybrids, and a fast-growing, disease-resistant oat hybrid.
