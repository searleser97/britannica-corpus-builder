Peppergrass,  (genus Lepidium), also called pepperwort or peppercress,  genus of some 230 species of herbs of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Peppergrass species are distributed throughout the world, and many are common lawn and field weeds. Some, such as garden cress (Lepidium sativum), are cultivated as salad plants for their peppery, piquant leaves.
Most peppergrass species are annuals and have long taproots. The broad basal leaves differ from the narrow leaves on the flowering stalks and range from entire to deeply lobed. Small greenish or whitish four-petaled flowers are arranged in short spikes, and the seeds are usually borne in flat, round, dry fruits called silicles.
Virginia peppergrass (L. virginicum), spread throughout North America, sometimes is known as canary grass because its seed stalks are fed to cage birds. Its leaves are used in salads. Lentejilla, or little lentil (L. armoracia), is native to Europe but has naturalized in Mexico, where it is used as a folk medicine. Pepperwort, or field pepper (L. campestre), is a widespread weed originally native to Europe. It has hairy arrowlike stem leaves and once was marketed as an antidote to poisons under the name of mithridate pepperwort. Maca, or Peruvian ginseng (L. meyenii), is native to the Andes Mountains of central Peru, where it is grown as a root vegetable for its fleshy underground storage organ known as a hypocotyl. The plant is also used in folk medicine, particularly as an aphrodisiac, and the “root” is sold commercially in powdered form.
