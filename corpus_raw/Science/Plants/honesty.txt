Honesty,  (genus Lunaria),  genus of three species of plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae), native to Europe. Two of the species, annual honesty (Lunaria annua) and perennial honesty (L. rediviva), are widely grown for their fragrant flowers and papery seedpod partitions, which are used in dried-flower arrangements.
Honesty plants bear disc- or oval-shaped fruits known as silicles. These dry capsules feature a silvery translucent partition between the two halves; the partition remains on the plant after the seeds have been dispersed. The best-known species, annual honesty, also known as the money, or silver dollar, plant, has four-petaled reddish purple or white flowers that are borne in summer. The species can be grown as an annual or a biennial and produces circular fruits with distinctive partitions. It has become naturalized in some wooded parts of eastern North America. Perennial honesty has pointed oval seedpod partitions and pale purple flowers. Lunaria telekiana is a rare plant endemic to the mountains of Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia.
