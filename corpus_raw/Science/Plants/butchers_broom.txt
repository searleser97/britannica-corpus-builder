Butcher’s broom,  any dark green shrub of the genus Ruscus of the 
family Ruscaceae, native to Eurasia. The plants lack leaves but have flattened, leaflike branchlets. The small flower clusters are borne in the centre of the branchlets, or on one side of the branchlet. The fruit is a red berry.
One species, called Jew’s myrtle (R. aculeatus), is cultivated for its branchlets, which are dyed and used as decorations in winter. The young shoots are edible; dried branches are used to make brooms.
