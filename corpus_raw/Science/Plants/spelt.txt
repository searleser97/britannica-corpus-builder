Spelt,  (Triticum spelta),  species of wheat (family Poaceae) grown for livestock forage and used in baked goods and cereals. Although spelt has an ancient history and was once an important crop in Europe during the Middle Ages, it has been largely supplanted by common wheat (Triticum aestivum). Spelt generally requires less fertilizer than other wheats and thus has gained some modern popularity as an organic farming crop. It is also used in artisanal breads and pastas and has a similar nutritional profile to conventional wheat.
The spelt plant has long slender leaves and hollow stems. It is characterized by lax spikes and flower spikelets that contain two light red kernels.
