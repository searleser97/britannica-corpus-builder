Willow oak,  (Quercus phellos),  ornamental and timber tree in the beech family (Fagaceae), noted for its willowlike leaves. Willow oak is native to poorly drained areas of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains and the Mississippi River valley region of North America. It is widely planted as a street tree or shade tree in the southern United States; it grows quickly and has a shallow root system. It lives for more than 100 years. See also oak.
About 18 metres (60 feet) tall, the willow oak has drooping lower branches and slender side branches, with spurlike branchlets similar to those of pin oak (Quercus palustris). The trunk has an almost conical symmetrical crown; the smooth grayish black bark becomes roughly ridged on older trees. The pale green tapering leaves turn yellow in autumn. Male and female flowers are borne separately in catkin clusters, and the fruit is a small acorn.
