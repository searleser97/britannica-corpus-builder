Yellow birch,  (Betula alleghaniensis), also called silver birch, golden birch, or swamp birch,   ornamental and timber tree of the family Betulaceae, native to northeastern North America. See also birch.
Among the largest of birches, yellow birch grows to 30 metres (100 feet) on cool moist bottomlands and on drier soils to elevations of 1,950 metres (6,400 feet). On limbs and young trunks the silvery yellow bark peels in paper-thin curls; on old trunks it is red-brown, deeply grooved, and broken into irregular plates. The toothed leaves are roughly oval in shape, tapering to a gentle point, and are borne alternately along the stems. The pale green twigs are slightly aromatic.
The hard, pale, red-brown wood usually is not separated from that of sweet birch (Betula lenta) commercially, both woods being sold for furniture, woodenware, veneer, and flooring.
