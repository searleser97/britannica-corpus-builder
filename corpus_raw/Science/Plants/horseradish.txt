Horseradish,  (Armoracia rusticana),  hardy perennial plant of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) known for its hotly pungent fleshy root, which is made into a condiment or table relish. Native to Mediterranean lands, horseradish is now grown throughout the temperate zones and is a troublesome weed in many cool, moist areas. The root is traditionally considered medicinal and is commonly used as a substitute for true wasabi (Eutrema japonicum) in Japanese cuisine.
Large, coarse, glossy green basal leaves arise from the large white root. Small white four-petaled flowers are borne in terminal or axillary racemes. The fruits are small oblong pods known as siliques and are tipped by a short persistent style.
Cultivators propagate horseradish in the spring by placing pieces of pencil-sized roots in the soil at a slight angle with the upper ends covered 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 inch) deep. All but the terminal shoots are removed to prevent later formation of multiple crowns, and the side roots are also rubbed off to minimize branching and crooked formation. Roots are harvested after one growing season and are washed and trimmed for sale.
