Shrub,   any woody plant that has several stems, none dominant, and is usually less than 3 m (10 feet) tall. When much-branched and dense, it may be called a bush. Intermediate between shrubs and trees are arborescences, or treelike shrubs, from 3 to 6 m tall. Trees are generally defined as woody plants more than 6 m tall, having a dominant stem, or trunk, and a definite crown shape. These distinctions are not reliable, however, for there are some shrubs, such as lilacs and honeysuckles, that, under especially favourable environmental conditions, grow to the size of an arborescence or even a small tree. Some specimens of a plant species may take a tree form, whereas others, under different conditions, may assume a shrub or arborescent formâ€”e.g., sumacs, willows, and spruces.
