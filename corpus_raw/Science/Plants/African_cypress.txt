African cypress,  (genus Widdringtonia),  genus of four species of coniferous trees and shrubs in the cypress family (Cupressaceae), native to southern Africa. Some species produce fragrant durable yellowish or brownish wood of local importance.
African cypresses are large woody plants with scalelike evergreen leaves borne in opposite pairs. The female cones mature to a length of about 3 cm (1.2 inches) and feature four woody scales. With the exception of Mulanje (or Mlanje) cedar (Widdringtonia whytei), the plants are fire-adapted and release their seeds following a wildfire, the heat of which forces the cones to open.
Willowmore cedar (W. schwarzii), a tree from the Cape Province region of South Africa, is usually gnarled and about 15 metres (49 feet) tall under unfavourable growing conditions; it may reach a height of 30 metres (98 feet) and have a graceful shape in less arid environments. The Berg cypress, or sapree-wood (W. nodiflora), is a shrub that grows to about 2 to 4 metres (6.5 to 13 feet) high. Mulanje cedar can reach 45 metres (148 feet) in height; it was once the most valuable timber tree of the genus, though it was later listed as a critically endangered species by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Clanwilliam cedar, or Cape cedar (W. cedarbergensis), is a tree 6 to 18 metres (20 to 59 feet) tall with wide-spreading branches that is found in the Cederberg Mountains of Western Cape province, South Africa; the species is also listed as critically endangered.
