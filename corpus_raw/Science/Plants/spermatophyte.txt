Spermatophyte, also called seed plant, phanerogam, or phaenogam,  any of the more than 300,000 species of seed-bearing tracheophytes (vascular plants). Although the taxonomic division Spermatophyta is no longer accepted, the term “spermatophyte” is used to refer collectively to the angiosperms (flowering plants) and gymnosperms (conifers, cycads, and allies).
