Elf-cap moss,  (genus Buxbaumia), also called bug-on-a-stick,  any of the 12 species of moss of the genus Buxbaumia (subclass Buxbaumiidae) that grow on soil or rotten wood in the Northern Hemisphere. The four species native to North America are uncommon. Male and female organs are borne on separate plants. The male plant has one clamshell-shaped leaflike structure that protects the sex organ. The female plant bears a few phyllids (simplified leaves) at the base of the long seta (stalk) supporting the cap-shaped capsule (spore case); the phyllids are shed before the capsule ripens. Buxbaumia differs from most other mosses in having an asexual phase plant (sporophyte) much larger and longer-lived than the annual sexual phase plant (gametophyte).
