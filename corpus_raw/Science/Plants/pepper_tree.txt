Pepper tree,  (Schinus molle), also called California pepper tree, Peruvian pepper tree, or Peruvian mastic,  ornamental tree of the cashew family (Anacardiaceae), native to dry South America and cultivated in warm regions. Its piquant fruits, often called “pink peppercorns,” are sometimes used in beverages and medicines because of their hot taste and aroma, though the plant is unrelated to true black pepper (Piper nigrum), the fruits of which are ground into a widely used spice. The pepper tree is a host plant for scale insects that damage orange trees and is controlled in susceptible agricultural areas. It is considered an invasive species in Australia and certain other areas outside its native range.
Pepper trees are long-lived and quick-growing and can reach some 15 metres (50 feet) in height. The plant has a wide canopy, and young branches are typically weeping. The long compound leaves have storage cells that contain a volatile oil and emit a peppery fragrance when broken. The small white flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Each small pink fruit has a hard dry kernel surrounding a single seed.
