Pyrethrum,  any of certain plant species of the aster family (Asteraceae) whose aromatic flower heads, when powdered, constitute the active ingredient in the insecticide called pyrethrin. The plants were formerly considered a separate genus, Pyrethrum, and the taxonomy remains contentious between the genera Tanacetum and Chrysanthemum.
The typical species, the perennial Tanacetum coccineum, is the florists’ pyrethrum, commonly called painted lady. Large deep rose-coloured ray flowers surrounding the yellow centre, or disk, are borne on long simple stems above the crown of finely cut leaves. Modern varieties exhibit various colours—white, lilac, and shades of red.
Dalmation pellitory, or pyrethrum daisy (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium), is daisylike in appearance, with white ray flowers surrounding a yellow centre. The blue-gray leaves are deeply divided. The plant is native to the Balkans and is important commercially as a source of pyrethrin.
Numerous other Chrysanthemum species contain pyrethrin compounds and are commonly grown as “companion plants” to repel insects from susceptible ornamental or edible plants.
The powdered flower heads of T. coccineum and C. cinerariifolium are chief sources of the insecticide. The active substances in pyrethrums are contact poisons for insects and cold-blooded vertebrates. The concentrations of pyrethrum powder used in insecticides are nontoxic to plants, birds, and mammals; therefore, these insecticides find wide use in household and livestock sprays as well as in dusts for edible plants. Naturally derived pyrethrin insecticides are an important means of chemical control in organic farming. Synthetic pyrethrin compounds, known as pyrethroids, have been developed. Both synthetic and non-synthetic pyrethrins can accumulate in water and wetland sediments and are toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates.
