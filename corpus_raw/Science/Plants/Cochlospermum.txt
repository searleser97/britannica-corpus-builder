Cochlospermum,  genus of tropical trees belonging to the family Cochlospermaceae. About 15 species are known, 3 occurring as far north as northern Mexico and southwestern United States. The buttercup tree (C. vitifolium), found in Central America and the West Indies, has bright-yellow, cup-shaped flowers about 10 cm (4 inches) across. In some areas rope is made of its bark. Several species yield dye. The seeds of C. angolense, an African species, yield a red dye; the roots of C. planchoni, also African, yield a yellow dye; and C. gossypium (India and Burma) produces a gum that can substitute for gum tragacanth.
