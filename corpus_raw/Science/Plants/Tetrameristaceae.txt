Tetrameristaceae,  flowering plant family of the order Ericales, composed of three genera of woody trees and small shrubs. Members of the family are characterized by flowers with glands on the inner surfaces of the sepals, five stamens, and only a single ovule in each part of the ovary.
The genus Pelliciera consists of a single species (P. rhizophorae) of evergreen mangrove trees on the Pacific coast or, rarely, the Atlantic coast of Central America and northern South America. Known as tea mangroves, those trees have long pointed terminal buds and spirally arranged leaves with asymmetrical bases and short stalks. The large flowers grow in the axils of the leaves (where the leaf stem joins the branch) and bear distinctive single-seeded fruits that are sharply pointed. Previously treated as its own family, Pelliciera is grouped within Tetrameristaceae by the 2009 Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III (APG III) botanical classification system.
The other two genera of the family are rather small woody plants. The three species of Tetramerista grow in Southeast Asia, and the single species of Pentamerista grows in the Guiana Highlands of Venezuela. Both genera have spiral short-stalked leaves with indistinct venation and marginal glands and bear fleshy fruits that are presumably dispersed by animals. Tetramerista has glistening dots on the inner surfaces of the petals and sepals.
