Sea rocket,  (genus Cakile),  genus of about seven species of plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Sea rockets are native to seashore regions of North America, Eurasia, western Asia, and Australia as well as to central Arabian deserts. The plants are considered edible and have a hot pungent flavour but are difficult to cultivate.
European sea rocket (Cakile maritima) has waxy, thick, lobed green leaves and pale-lavender flower clusters. Its leaves, 30 to 60 cm (1 to 2 feet) long, rise from a long taproot. American sea rocket (C. edentula) is a similar plant native to North American seashores and the Great Lakes. In some areas of North America, European sea rocket has displaced native sea rockets and become an invasive species.
