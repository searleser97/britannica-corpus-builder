Zucchini,  (Cucurbita pepo), also called courgette,  variety of summer squash in the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), grown for its edible fruits. Zucchinis are common in home gardens and supermarkets, and the young fruits are cooked as a vegetable. The flowers are also edible and are sometimes fried.
Zucchini plants are typically bushy and non-vining, though some varieties have a creeping habit. The leaves are large and palmately lobed, and both the stems and the leaves have small prickly trichomes (plant hairs). The large unisexual flowers have five yellow-orange petals and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Most varieties bear dark green cylindrical fruit, but some produce round or intermediate shapes in colours ranging from yellow-green to nearly black. The fruit is a type of berry known as a pepo and is usually harvested before the rind hardens. The plants are susceptible to squash bugs and squash vine borers, and the fruits can be affected by blossom-end rot in uneven watering conditions.
