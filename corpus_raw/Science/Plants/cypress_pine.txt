Cypress pine,  (genus Callitris),  genus of 15 species of coniferous shrubs and trees in the cypress family (Cupressaceae). Cypress pines are native to Australasia and grow best in arid localities. The wood is often attractively marked and is resistant to termite attack. Tannin, sandarac resin, and fragrant oils can be extracted from the trees, and several species are grown as ornamentals.
Cypress pines are evergreens with scalelike leaves that are characteristically borne in whorls of three; their tips are often thickened and curve inward. The male cones are small and are produced at the tips of the branches. The female cones are nearly round and feature six woody scales arranged in two whorls. Several species are fire-adapted and generally release their seeds following a wildfire.
The most important timber trees of the genus are the Murray River pine, or white cypress pine (Callitris columellaris), found throughout Australia; the black cypress pine (C. endlicheri) of eastern Australia, locally also called black pine, red pine, and scrub pine; the Port Macquarie pine, or stringybark (C. macleayana), of southeastern Australia; and the common cypress pine (C. preissii) of southern Australia, often shrubby near the seacoast, with one subspecies called slender pine and another known as turpentine pine. Most of these timber trees are about 25 metres (about 80 feet) tall, but the Port Macquarie pine, also planted as an ornamental, may reach 45 metres (148 feet). Timber from the Oyster Bay pine (C. rhomboidea), a coastal tree of eastern and southern Australia, usually 9 to 15 metres (29.5 to 49 feet) tall, is used for local construction. C. sulcata, endemic to New Caledonia, is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
The related sandplain cypresses (genus Actinostrobus) and the African cypresses (genus Widdringtonia) are sometimes also called cypress pines.
