Moraceae,  the mulberry family of the rose order (Rosales), with about 40 genera and some 1,000 species of deciduous or evergreen trees and shrubs, distributed mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. Plants of the family contain a milky latex and have alternate or opposite leaves and small, petalless male or female flowers. The fruits of many species are multiple because fruits from different flowers become joined together.
Some genera produce edible fruits, such as the mulberry (Morus), fig (Ficus carica), breadfruit and jackfruit (Artocarpus), and affon, or African breadfruit (Treculia). Others, such as Antiaris, Ficus, and Castilla, are important for their timber and latex. The latex of the upas tree (Antiaris toxicaria) of Java is used as an arrow poison; the latex of the cow tree (Brosimum utile) of tropical America is sweet and nutritious. Ficus, the largest genus in the mulberry family, contains the banyan and the India rubber tree. The bark of the paper mulberry (Broussonetia) has been used for the manufacture of cloth and paper products. Among the ornamentals in the family are paper mulberry and Osage orange.
