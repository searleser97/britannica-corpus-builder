Spike moss,  (family Selaginellaceae),  family of more than 700 species of mossy or fernlike seedless vascular plants of the order Selaginellales. The family consists of a single genus, Selaginella. They are widely distributed in all parts of the world, particularly in the tropics. Many are forest plants; some grow on trees, but others thrive in dry or seasonally dry areas. (See also lycophyte and lower vascular plant.)
Spike mosses bear scalelike leaves, either spirally arranged or in ranks of four, on trailing, climbing, or erect stems and branches. The spore-bearing leaves are similar to ordinary leaves but are clustered in spikes, or strobili. All species are heterosporous; that is, they produce spores of two sizes, the larger designated as megaspores and the smaller as microspores. The megaspores develop into female gametophytes and the microspores into male gametophytes. Both types of spores are thick-walled, and both have prominent three-part (triradiate) ridges.
Lesser club moss, or club spike moss, (Selaginella selaginoides), is a small forest and bog-side plant in northern North America and Eurasia. Its branches trail along the ground, but the upright yellow-green strobili rise up to 8 cm (about 3 inches). The similar rock selaginella (S. rupestris) of North America has smaller leaves, and its branching stems grow on rocks or in sand. Resurrection fern, or false rose of Jericho, (S. lepidophylla), is so named because as an apparently lifeless ball it unrolls when the wet season begins. Spreading club moss, or Kraussâ€™s spike moss (S. kraussiana), from southern Africa, roots readily along its trailing stems of bright green branches. It sometimes is grown as a houseplant, as are S. emmeliana from tropical America, variegated spike moss (S. martensii) from Mexico, blue spike moss (S. uncinata) from southern China, and handsome spike moss (S. caulescens) from East Asia.
