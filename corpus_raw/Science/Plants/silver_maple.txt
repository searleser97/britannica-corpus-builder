Silver maple, also called soft maple, orwhite maple,  (Acer saccharinum), large, spreading tree, of the soapberry family (Sapindaceae), popular as a rapid-growing shade tree. Native to eastern North America, it is widely cultivated elsewhere.
It grows to 18 metres (60 feet)—higher under favourable conditions—with a short, stout trunk and wide, irregular crown; slender drooping branches turn upward at the tips. Young bark is smooth and gray, becoming flaky with age. The deeply cut five-lobed leaf is light green above and silvery below. Inconspicuous greenish flowers appear along the shoots before the leaves unfurl in spring. The paired, winged fruit are the largest of any maple. The seeds are food for squirrels and birds; young twigs and foliage are eaten by deer. The soft wood has been used for crating and inexpensive furniture. Syrup can be obtained from the sap but in low yield.
Formerly a popular landscaping tree, the silver maple is now often excluded from public grounds because its brittle branches and twigs break easily, showering debris on the ground, and because it often sows numerous undesired seedlings in gardens and lawns. Among the varieties useful in landscaping are the cut-leaf silver maple (A. saccharinum ‘Laciniatum’), with deeply indented, lacy leaves, and the pyramidal silver maple (A. saccharinum ‘Pyramidale’), both of which are less liable to wind damage because they are shorter than the regular species.
