Pimiento,  (Capsicum annuum), also called pimento,  any of various mild peppers in the nightshade family (Solanaceae). The term pimiento, from the Spanish for “pepper,” is applied to several cultivars of Capsicum annuum that possess a distinctive flavour but lack pungency. Those include the European paprikas, from which the spice of the same name is made, and the cherry peppers commonly used to stuff Spanish green olives and to flavour pimiento cheese. The name “pimento” is also used for the unrelated allspice tree (Pimenta dioica).
