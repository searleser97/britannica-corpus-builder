Rue,  (genus Ruta),   genus of about 40 species of perennial shrubs and herbs in the family Rutaceae, native to Eurasia and the Canary Islands. Common rue (R. graveolens) is cultivated as a small garden shrub for its evergreen leaves and dull-yellow flower clusters. The gland-studded, translucent leaves have been used for centuries as a spice and in traditional medicines.
Rue species are evergreen and typically are strongly aromatic. The feathery, pinnately compound leaves usually have two or three leaflets and are often gray-green or blue-green in colour. The yellow flowers, borne in clusters, produce lobed capsules with numerous seeds.
Meadow rue is an unrelated plant of the genus Thalictrum in the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae).
