shooting star,  in botany, any of several species of flowering plants formerly of the genus Dodecatheon and now placed in the genus Primula (family Primulaceae). The plants are mostly native to western North America, though one species is native to Asiatic Russia. Several species are cultivated—often in rock gardens—for their attractive flowers.
The low-growing shooting stars are perennial herbs with wavy-margined leaves growing in a rosette. The flowers, which are commonly reddish, purple, lilac, pink, or white, grow in a small cluster at the end of a leafless stalk (scape). The five lobes of the corolla (the structure formed by the petals) are turned backward, and the flowers point downward. The flowers are “buzz pollinated,” meaning that they require a certain frequency of vibration from bees in order to release their pollen.
Darkthroat, or pretty, shooting star (Primula pauciflorum) and broad-leaved shooting star (P. hendersonii), both native to dry regions of the western United States, are common cultivated species. Several varieties of eastern shooting star (P. meadia), native to eastern North America, are also grown as ornamentals. Western Arctic shooting star (P. frigida) is a small delicate species found in Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and far eastern Russia.
