sycamore,  any of several distinct trees. In the United States it refers especially to the American plane tree (Platanus occidentalis). The sycamore of the Bible is better termed sycamore fig (Ficus sycamorus; see also fig), notable for its use by ancient Egyptians to make mummy cases. The sycamore maple, or mock plane (Acer pseudoplatanus), is sometimes also called, simply, sycamore.
