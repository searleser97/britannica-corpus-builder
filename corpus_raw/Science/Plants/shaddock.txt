Pummelo,  (Citrus maxima), also spelled pomelo, also called shaddock,  citrus tree of the family Rutaceae, grown for its large sweet fruits. It is native to mainland Southeast Asia and the Malaysian portion of the island of Borneo. It is sometimes called shaddock, a name that is said to have derived from that of a captain who introduced the tree to the West Indies. The fruit is highly prized in Asia, and the rind is sometimes candied or used in marmalade. Pummelo is one of the original citrus species from which most commercial cultivars are derived; the grapefruit (Citrus ×paradisi), for example, is a cross of pummelo and sweet orange (C. ×sinensis).
Pummelo trees reach 6–13 metres (20–43 feet) in height. The oval evergreen leaves have broadly winged petioles (leaf stems) and are downy on the undersurface, as are the young shoots. The flowers are large and white and are succeeded by very large spheroid or almost pear-shaped fruits, which are lemon-yellow to green in colour and have a sweet flavour. The pulp segments are either pallid or pink and shell out easily from the thick rind.
