catkin,  elongated cluster of single-sex flowers bearing scaly bracts and usually lacking petals. Catkins may be erect or pendulous and are often somewhat inconspicuous. Many trees bear catkins, including willows, birches, and oaks. Wind carries pollen from male to female catkins or from male catkins to female flowers arranged in a different inflorescence form (e.g., in spikes). Depending on the species, a catkin-producing plant may be monoecious (both male and female flowers are present on a single individual) or dioecious (female and male flowers are borne on separate individuals).
