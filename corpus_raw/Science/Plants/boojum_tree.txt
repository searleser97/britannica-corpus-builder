Boojum tree,  (Fouquieria columnaris), also called cirio,   unusual flowering tree (family Fouquieriaceae) endemic to the deserts of Baja California and a small area of Sonora, Mexico. Fancifully, it resembles a slender upside-down carrot, up to 15 metres (50 feet) tall and covered with spiny twigs that bear yellowish flowers in hanging clusters. As with its relative the ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), the small leaves appear after rainfall and are drought-deciduous, meaning they fall off during the dry season to limit water loss. The greenish stems carry out most of the food-producing photosynthesis. The swollen trunk base is often hollow and provides a habitat for bees; the wood is somewhat spongy and retains water. The boojum tree is sometimes planted in southern California and Arizona as a landscape curiosity; small plants can be grown indoors.
