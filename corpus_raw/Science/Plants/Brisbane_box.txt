Brisbane box,   (Tristania conferta), evergreen tree, of the family Myrtaceae, native to Australia and commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of North America as a shade tree. It grows to more than 45 metres (about 150 feet) tall, and it has oval or lance-shaped leaves 7–15 centimetres (3–6 inches) long and produces small white flowers. The Brisbane box is extremely drought-resistant and the exceptionally strong, durable timber it yields is used commercially in construction and manufacturing.
