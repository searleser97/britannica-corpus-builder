Dicentra,  genus of eight species of flowering plants of the poppy family (Papaveraceae). The genus features a number of popular garden ornamentals, including Dutchmanâ€™s breeches (Dicentra cucullaria), squirrel corn (D. canadensis), and some species of bleeding heart. The common Asian bleeding heart (Lamprocapnos spectabilis) was formerly placed in this genus, but its taxonomy has been revised.
Members of the genus Dicentra are annual or perennial herbaceous plants. The finely divided leaves are characteristically borne in a basal rosette. The unusual flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and have swollen or spur-shaped outer petals. Two compound stamens (male structures) and the pistil (female structure) are found between the inner petals. The seeds have fleshy structures known as elaiosomes to attract ants for dispersal.
