Horn-tooth moss,  any plant of the genus Ceratodon (about 5 species) in the subclass Bryidae. The most abundant of the species, C. purpureus, has a worldwide distribution and is conspicuous because of its purple capsule (spore case), especially when growing on bare, acidic soil or burned areas. Horn-tooth mosses are 1 to 2 cm (about 2/5 to 4/5 inches) high and grow in mats or tufts in dry habitats such as on walls, lawns, and sidewalks; but they may sometimes be found in swamps. Male and female reproductive organs are borne on separate plants. The capsules are held horizontally and have long, deep furrows when mature.
