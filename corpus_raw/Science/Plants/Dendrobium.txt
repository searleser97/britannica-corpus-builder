Dendrobium,  genus of as many as 1,500 species of epiphytic orchids (family Orchidaceae). Dendrobium species are native to tropical and subtropical Asia, many Pacific islands, and Australia. Many are cultivated as ornamentals, and some are important in the floral industry. Popular members of the genus include the pigeon orchid (Dendrobium crumenatum), a white-flowered species; the bull orchid (D. taurinum), a Philippine species with twisted, hornlike petals; and the cucumber orchid (D. cucumerinum), an Australian species with unusual, cucumber-like leaves.
Some Dendrobium species have small, pale flowers; others have large, showy ones. The flowers may be borne singly, in groups, or on arching spikes. The lateral sepals of the flowers are joined at the base, forming a small sac. The pseudobulbs (swollen stems) are bulblike or reedlike and range in height from 5 cm to about 4.5 metres (2 inches to 15 feet).
