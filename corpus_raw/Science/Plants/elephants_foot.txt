Elephant’s-foot,  (Dioscorea elephantipes), also called hottentot bread,  an odd-looking twining plant of the yam family (Dioscoreaceae), characterized by a large, woody, and partially exposed tuber. It is native to semiarid areas in southern Africa. The tubercle-covered tuber, resembling an elephant’s foot or a tortoise shell, once served as a food for local peoples during famine (hence the name “Hottentot bread”). The tuber can reach up to 1 m (3 feet) in diameter, and specimens weighing several hundred pounds have been reported. From such a root stock each year emerge thin climbing stems with small leaves. The plant is grown in desert gardens and conservatories as a curiosity.
