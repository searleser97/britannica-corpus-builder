Burdock,  (genus Arctium), also spelled burrdock,  a genus of biennial plants in the Asteraceae family, bearing globular flower heads with prickly bracts (modified leaves). Burdock species, native to Europe and Asia, have been naturalized throughout North America. Though regarded as weeds in the United States, they are cultivated for their edible root in Asia. Their fruits are round burrs that stick to clothing and fur.
Common, or lesser, burdock (Arctium minus) is a weed in North American pastures and hayfields and can be grown as a vegetable. The plant forms a low rosette during its first year and develops a tall branched stem during its second year. The leaves have a wavy margin and a hairy underside when young and are attached to the stem by a hollow petiole. The flowers are purple, sometimes white, and produce achenes (small dry fruits) when mature. The dried flower head somewhat resembles a thistle, though it can be distinguished by its distinctive hooked bracts.
