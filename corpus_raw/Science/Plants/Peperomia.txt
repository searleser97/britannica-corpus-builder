Peperomia,  genus of the pepper family (Piperaceae), comprising more than 1,000 species of tropical and subtropical fleshy herbs, annuals, and perennials. A few species are popular houseplants because of their attractive foliage.
The leaves of Peperomia species are sometimes attractively coloured with veins or spots and are usually oval-shaped, thick, fleshy, and smooth-edged. The thick stalk of the leaf is attached to the centre of the underside of the leaf of some species. The flowers are minute and densely packed on a slender spike, which is likely to be curved. Some are epiphytic (growing on the branches of trees).
Watermelon peperomia (P. argyreia), native to Brazil, grows about 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 inches) tall. Dark red leafstalks support alternate leaves, which are up to 10 cm (4 inches) long and 7.5 cm (3 inches) wide. The leaves are handsomely marked with broad, creamy bands parallel to the veins.
Baby rubberplant (P. obtusifolia), another popular cultivated species, is also native to the tropics. It lies close to the soil and has wrinkled, reddish stems. The minute flowers are red. The leaves, about 7.5 to 12.5 cm (3 to 5 inches) long, have small notches near the tip and are red or white along the margins. The young leaves and stems of P. pellucida are used as food in Central and South America.
