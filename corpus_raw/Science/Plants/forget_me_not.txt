Forget-me-not,  any of several dozen species of the plant genus Myosotis (family Boraginaceae), native to temperate Eurasia and North America and to mountains of the Old World tropics. Some are favoured as garden plants for their clusters of blue flowers. (For Chinese forget-me-not, see houndâ€™s-tongue.)
The woods forget-me-not (M. sylvatica), like most other Myosotis, changes colour from pink to blue as the tubular, flaring, five-lobed flower matures. The water forget-me-not (M. scorpioides) is shorter and has weaker stems; it grows in marshlands but is otherwise similar. Both are perennial and occur in white- and pink-flowered forms as well as blue.
