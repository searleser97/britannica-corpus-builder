Sphenoclea,  the only genus in the plant family Sphenocleaceae (order Solanales). It contains two species. Sphenoclea zeylanica is an herb 1.5 metres (4 feet) tall with spikes of whitish flowers. The West African S. dalzielli is distinguished by its obovate leaves.
S. zeylanica is widespread in moist areas of warm temperate and tropical zones, including southern North America, but is native to the Old World tropics. It is sometimes united with the family Campanulaceae, from which it differs by having overlapping corolla (petal) lobes in bud and a capsule that opens by a lid. The five-lobed flowers are in tight masses, and the narrow leaves are oval in shape.
