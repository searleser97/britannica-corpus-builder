Heliconia,  (genus Heliconia),  the only genus of the family Heliconiaceae, with nearly 200 species of flowering plants in tropical America and certain islands of the western Pacific. Several species are cultivated for their brightly coloured flower bracts (leaf-shaped structures).
These attractive plants are perennial herbs with stout or reedlike stems. The simple banana-like leaves sometimes show a coppery sheen, and the midrib may be ivory and pink. The colourful inflorescence is formed of waxy bracts that alternate in a single plane and support the numerous small flowers. The inflorescences may be hanging or erect. The flowers themselves can be red, orange, yellow, or green and are usually pollinated by hummingbirds. The fruits are blue to blue-purple when ripe.
One colourful species, the parrot heliconia (H. psittacorum), named for its resemblance to a parrotâ€™s plumage, has greenish yellow flowers with black spots near the tips and red bracts; a number of horticultural varieties of other colours have also been developed. The flower bracts of hanging lobster claw, or false bird-of-paradise (H. rostrata), the national flower of Bolivia, are a striking combination of hot pink, yellow, and green. Dwarf Jamaican heliconia (H. stricta) is smaller than most other cultivated species and has several attractive varieties. Pink flamingo (H. chartacea) and wild plantain (H. caribaea) are also cultivated as ornamentals.
