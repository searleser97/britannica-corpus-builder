Ocotillo,  (Fouquieria splendens), also called coachwhip, Jacob’s staff, or vine cactus,  flowering spiny shrub (family Fouquieriaceae) characteristic of rocky deserts from western Texas to southern California and southward into Mexico. Near the plant’s base, the stem divides into several slender, erect, wide-spreading, intensely spiny branches, usually about 2.5 to 6 metres (8 to 20 feet) long. The branches bear small, rounded, drought-deciduous leaves, which fall soon after the end of the winter rainy season. They leave behind the petioles (leaf stalks), which harden and develop into stout spines, and most of the photosynthesis is carried out by the greenish stems. The bright scarlet flowers are in showy branched terminal clusters 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 inches) long. Ocotillo is grown as a hedge plant and occasional ornamental in its native range.
