blueberry,  any of several North American shrubs of the genus Vaccinium (family Ericaceae), prized for their sweet edible fruits. Hailed as a “superfood,” blueberries are an excellent source of dietary fibre, vitamin C, vitamin K, manganese, iron, and a number of antioxidants. They are commonly eaten fresh as a dessert fruit and can be baked in a variety of pastries. Blueberries are closely related to cranberries and bilberries, which are also members of the genus Vaccinium.
The plants are deciduous perennial shrubs that range in size from 60 cm (24 inches) tall for lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium) up to 4 metres (13 feet) tall for highbush (V. corymbosum) cultivars. They have simple elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the dotted stems. The plants produce clusters of small urn-shaped flowers that range in colour from white to pale pink. The fruits are true berries with many small seeds and are a deep indigo to black colour when ripe.
Blueberries grow only in highly acidic and well-drained but moist soils in areas with cool climates. The highbush blueberry is the most commonly cultivated species, with over 50 cultivars, and is grown extensively in Michigan, Oregon, Washington, Maine, and New Jersey. The southern rabbiteye (V. ashei) can tolerate higher temperatures and is frequently grown in the southern United States. Although the majority of blueberries are grown commercially in North and South America, increased interest in the crop has led to a growing number of farms around the world.
