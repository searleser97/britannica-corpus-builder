Musaceae,   the banana family of plants (order Zingiberales), consisting of 2 genera, Musa and Ensete, with about 50 species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. The common banana (M. sapientum) is a subspecies of the plantain (M. paradisiaca). Both are important food plants.
The slender or conical false trunk of Musaceae herbs may rise to 15 metres (50 feet). The “trunk” is formed by the leaf sheaths of the spirally arranged leaves, which form a crown at the top. The large leaves may be up to three metres long and half a metre wide. The prominent midrib of the leaf is joined at right or slightly oblique angles with parallel veins. When the plant grows in an unsheltered place, wind and rain easily tear the leaves between the veins, giving the leaves a fringed or ragged appearance. The large, leathery bracts (leaflike structures) are red to purple. The yellow flowers have five fertile stamens and are rich in nectar.
Some species of wild bananas, such as M. coccinea, have ornamental scarlet flowers but inedible fruit. M. textilis from the Philippines furnishes Manila hemp, also called abaca fibre. The genus Ensete of Africa produces no edible bananas, but the flower stalk of one species, E. ventricosa, is edible after cooking. Species of Ensete are distinguished from those of Musa by their larger seeds. See also abaca; banana; plantain.
