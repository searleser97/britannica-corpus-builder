Clianthus, also called glory pea or kakabeak,  genus of two species of flowering shrubs in the pea family (Fabaceae). Parrot’s bill, or red kowhai (Clianthus puniceus), and kakabeak (C. maximus) are native to New Zealand and Australia, respectively. Both plants are grown as ornamentals but are considered endangered species in the wild.
Clianthus species grow to 1–2 metres (3–6 feet) tall and bear brilliant red flowers (whence the name, from Greek kleios, “glory,” and anthos, “flower”). The flowers, 7.5–10 cm (3–4 inches) or longer, are downward-turning with one standard, or upturned, petal. Leaves are pinnately compound, with one to two dozen short leaflets alternating along the stem. The plants grow well in warm dry climates with sandy well-drained soils and can be trained as vines. The shoots are typically pruned once flowering is over.
 The related Sturt’s desert pea (Swainsona formosa, formerly C. formosus), native to Australia, is often grafted onto C. puniceus rootstock, which is less susceptible to root rot.
