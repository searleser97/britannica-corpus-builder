Katherine Esau,  (born April 3, 1898, Yekaterinoslav, Russia [now Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine]—died June 4, 1997, Santa Barbara, Calif., U.S.), Russian-born American botanist who did groundbreaking work in the structure and workings of plants. Her Plant Anatomy is a classic in the field.
Esau was born to a Mennonite family of German descent. When the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 cut short her agricultural studies in Moscow, she and her family fled by wagon to Germany, where she continued her studies. After her graduation from the Berlin Agricultural College in 1922, she and her parents went to the United States, where they made their home in a predominantly Mennonite community in Reedley, California. For her first job in the United States she worked on developing a sugar beet with resistance to the curly top virus. She received a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1931 and joined the faculty at the university’s branch at Davis. Her textbook Plant Anatomy (1953) became the foremost text in the United States on plant structure and was widely adopted abroad. In 1957 she became the sixth woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences.
In 1963 Esau joined the faculty at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Although she officially retired in 1965, becoming professor emerita, she continued her engagement in research until 1994. In 1989, when she was awarded the National Medal of Science, she became the first trained botanist to be so honoured. She published her last paper in 1990 and continued to work on revisions to Plant Anatomy (an update of which had been published in 1965) until 1992.
