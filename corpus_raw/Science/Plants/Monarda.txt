Monarda,   genus of 12 North American plants variously known as bergamot, horsemint, and bee balm, belonging to the mint family (Lamiaceae), order Lamiales. The flowers are red, rose, lavender, yellow, or white; tubular; two-lipped; and in clusters surrounded by leaflike bracts.
M. fistulosa, growing to 1.5 m (5 feet) tall, has a minty aroma. The more sharply scented Oswego tea (M. didyma), shorter and with scarlet flowers, is native in eastern North America but is widely cultivated elsewhere.
