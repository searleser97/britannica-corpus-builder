taro,  (Colocasia esculenta), also called eddo or dasheen,  herbaceous plant of the arum family (Araceae) and its edible rootlike corm. Taro is probably native to southeastern Asia, whence it spread to Pacific islands and became a staple crop. It is cultivated for its large, starchy, spherical corms (underground stems), commonly known as “taro root,” which are consumed as a cooked vegetable, made into puddings and breads, and also made into the Polynesian poi, a thin, pasty, highly digestible mass of fresh or fermented taro starch. The large leaves of the taro are commonly stewed.
Taro is cultivated in rich well-drained soil. The corms are harvested seven months after planting. Taro leaves and corms are poisonous if eaten raw; the acrid calcium oxalate they contain must first be destroyed by heating.
