Bell pepper,  (Capsicum annuum), also called sweet pepper or capsicum,  pepper cultivar in the nightshade family (Solanaceae), grown for its thick, mild fruits. Bell peppers are used in salads and in cooked dishes and are high in vitamin A and vitamin C. The large furrowed fruits are technically berries and can be green, red, yellow, or orange. Bell pepper plants are grown as annuals, and the green varieties are harvested before the appearance of red or yellow pigment—generally about 60–80 days after transplanting.
