Bromegrass,  (genus Bromus), also called brome or cheatgrass,  genus of approximately 160 annual and perennial grasses in the family Poaceae, found in temperate and cool climates. More than 40 species are found in the United States, a number of which are imporant forage grasses. Several species, including cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), are invasive species in areas outside their native range.
Bromegrasses have flat thin leaves with distinctive closed leaf sheaths. The open spreading flower clusters are erect or drooping, and the plants characteristically feature hairy appendages on the ovaries. Most species are 30 to 100 cm (12 to 40 inches) tall.
Rescue grass (B. catharticus), a winter annual introduced from South America into the United States as a forage and pasture grass, and smooth brome (B. inermis), a perennial native to Eurasia and introduced into the northern United States as a forage plant and soil binder, are economically important bromegrasses. The common weed chess (B. secalinus), sometimes known as cheat, is found along roadsides and in grain fields. Cheatgrass, ripgut grass (B. diandrus), and foxtail brome (B. rubens) are dangerous to grazing animals; spines on their spikelets or bracts can puncture the animalsâ€™ eyes, mouths, and intestines, leading to infection and possible death.
