Boston ivy,  (Parthenocissus tricuspidata), also called Japanese ivy,  clinging woody vine of the grape family (Vitaceae). Native to eastern Asia, the plant has been introduced into other regions, particularly as a climbing ornamental on stone and brick facades. Boston ivy grows on many old college and university buildings in northeast North America, hence the name Ivy League.
The vine rapidly grows to a length of about 18 metres (about 60 feet). The alternate leaves, which are either simple and three-lobed or compound with three leaflets, turn bright scarlet in the autumn; the plant is semi-deciduous in warmer climates.  The plant clings to surfaces with adhesive holdfasts, or sucker disks, which form at the tendril ends of the stems. The inconspicuous flowers grow in clusters opposite the leaves. The small bluish black fruit is sought by birds.
