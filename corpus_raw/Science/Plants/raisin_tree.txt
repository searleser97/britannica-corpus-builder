Raisin tree, also called Honey Tree, or Japanese Raisin Tree,   (species Hovenia dulcis), shrub or tree, of the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae), native to East Asia and sometimes cultivated in other regions. It is so-named because the fruit resembles a raisin in size and colour.
The plant grows to about 7.5 m (about 25 feet) in height and has alternate, broadly oval leaves with long stalks. The small, greenish flowers grow in clusters from the branch tips or from the axils (upper angle at junction of leaf stem with branch). After the flower falls, the flower stalk swells into a red, sweet-tasting, edible mass.
