Tiger-flower,  (genus Tigridia), also called shell flower,  genus of about 35 species of flowering plants of the iris family (Iridaceae) native from Mexico to Chile. One tiger-flower, also known as Mexican shell flower (Tigridia pavonia), is cultivated for its attractive flowers and was once prized by the Aztecs for the chestnut flavour of its bulblike corms.
Tiger-flowers are perennial plants that emerge from bulbs or corms. The flowers, in a range of colours including orange-red, have three lower floral parts alternating with three much smaller petals, all with a spotted cup at the centre. They are held by 60-centimetre (2-foot) stems among sparse swordlike leaves.
