Chinquapin, also spelled chinkapin,  any of several species of trees in various genera of the beech family (Fagaceae). Notably, they include several deciduous trees of the genus Castanea and evergreen trees and shrubs of the genus Castanopsis and Chrysolepis.
Chinquapins in the chestnut genus Castanea have hairy leaves and twigs and single-seeded burs. The American chinquapin, also known as dwarf chestnut (Castanea pumila), is found throughout much of the eastern and southern United States, though populations have declined because of infection by chestnut blight, a fungal disease. It ranges in size from a small shrub to a tree up to 14 metres (46 feet) high. Its nuts are consumed locally and its durable wood has been used for telephone poles, fence posts, and railroad ties. The Henry chinquapin (C. henryi), an ornamental and timber tree native to China, sometimes attains a height of 28 metres (92 feet).
The evergreen chinquapins of the genus Castanopsis comprise about 110 Asian species. Many are found in tropical areas, and several are considered keystone species in their forest habitats. Most produce edible nuts, and some are cultivated as ornamental or timber trees.
The taxonomy of the genus is somewhat contentious, and the two North American species are now placed in the genus Chrysolepis. The golden, or giant, evergreen chinquapin (Chrysolepis chrysophylla), is native to western North America. It may be 45 metres (148 feet) tall and has lance-shaped leaves about 15 cm (6 inches) long, coated beneath with golden-yellow scales. The bush, or Sierra evergreen, chinquapin (Chrysolepis sempervirens) is a small spreading mountain shrub of western North America and was also formerly of the genus Castanopsis.
The water chinquapin is another name for the American lotus (Nelumbo lutea). The chinquapin oak refers to Quercus prinoides and to Q. muehlenbergii (see white oak).
