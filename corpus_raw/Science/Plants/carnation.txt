Carnation,  (Dianthus caryophyllus), also called grenadine or clove pink,  herbaceous plant of the pink, or carnation, family (Caryophyllaceae), native to the Mediterranean area. It is widely cultivated for its fringe-petaled flowers, which often have a spicy fragrance, and is used extensively in the floral industry. See also pink (Dianthus).
There are two general groups, the border, or garden, carnations and the perpetual flowering carnations. Border carnations include a range of varieties and hybrids, 30 to 75 cm (1 to 2.5 feet) tall; the flowers, in a wide range of colours, are usually less than 5 cm (2 inches) in diameter and are borne on wiry, stiffly erect stems. The bluish green leaves are narrow, sheathing the stems; there are swellings at the junction of leaf and stem.
The perpetual flowering carnation, perhaps derived from crosses between the border carnations and cottage pink (D. plumarius), is taller, up to 1 metre (3 feet) in height, is stouter, and produces larger flowers; it blooms almost continuously in the greenhouse. Miniature (baby) and spray varieties of the perpetual carnation are also grown for the florist trade.
Carnations are among the most popular commercial cut flowers, being used in floral arrangements, corsages, and boutonnieres. In 1907 Anna Jarvis of Philadelphia selected the pink carnation as the symbol for Motherâ€™s Day. In Europe the carnation was formerly used as a treatment for fevers. It was also used to spice wine and ale during Elizabethan times, as a substitute for the more expensive clove (Syzygium aromaticum).
