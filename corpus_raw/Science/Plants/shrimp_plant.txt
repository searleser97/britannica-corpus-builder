Shrimp plant,  (Justicia brandegeeana), also called Mexican shrimp plant or shrimp bush,  popular border and greenhouse ornamental of the family Acanthaceae, native to warm regions of the Americas and to the West Indies. Grown for its unusual flower clusters, the shrimp plant will bloom continuously in frost-free areas and is highly attractive to hummingbirds.
Shrimp plants have several spindly stems and can reach about 45 cm to 1 metre (18 to 39 inches) in height, though the plants are more attractive if regularly pruned. The plants bear drooping clusters of white tubular two-lipped flowers enclosed or accompanied by numerous reddish brown leaflike bracts that suggest the shape and colour of shrimps. The ovate leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and are evergreen in mild climates.
The golden shrimp plant, or lollipop plant (Pachystachys lutea), is similar in appearance but features yellow bracts instead of reddish. It is also in the family Acanthaceae.
