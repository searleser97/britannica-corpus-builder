Spider plant,  (Chlorophytum comosum),  African plant of the asparagus family (Asparagaceae) commonly grown as an ornamental houseplant. The most popular varieties feature long grassy green-and-white-striped leaves. Periodically a flower stem emerges, and tiny white flowers—not always produced—are replaced by young plantlets, which can then be detached and rooted. Spider plants are easy to grow and thrive under a variety of conditions.
