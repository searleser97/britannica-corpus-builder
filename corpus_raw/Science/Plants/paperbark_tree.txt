Paperbark tree,   any of several small trees belonging to the genus Melaleuca, in the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), characterized by their whitish papery bark. They are native to Australia and nearby islands.
Melaleuca quinquenervia, also called punk tree and tea tree, grows to a height of 8 metres (25 feet); it has spongy white bark that peels off in thin layers. M. leucadendron, also called river tea tree, is sometimes confused with the former; its leaves provide cajeput oil, used for medicinal purposes in parts of the Orient. The common name swamps paperbark is applied to M. ericifolia, which often grows in clumps, and to M. rhaphiophylla. These shrubs and small trees are sometimes cultivated in warm areas for their whitish to yellowish terminal flower clusters.
