Urticaceae,  the nettle family (order Rosales) comprising about 54 genera and 2,625 species of herbs, shrubs, small trees, and a few vines, distributed primarily in tropical regions. The stems and leaves of many species—especially the nettles (Urtica), the wood nettles (Laportea), and the Australian stinging trees (Dendrocnide)—have stinging trichomes (plant hairs) that cause a painful rash upon contact. The long fibres in the stems of some species, such as ramie (Boehmeria nivea), are used in the textile industry.
Members of the family Urticaceae have varied leaves and sap that is usually watery. The small greenish flowers often form clusters in the leaf axils. Both male flowers and female flowers may be borne on the same plant, though some species are dioecious (producing male flowers on one individual and female on another). The curled stamens of the male flowers straighten quickly as the flowers open, releasing the pollen. The dry one-seeded fruit often is enclosed by the outer whorl of the flower cluster.
Pilea, a genus of creeping plants that includes the artillery plant (P. microphylla), and pellitory (Parietaria), a genus of wall plants, are grown as ornamentals. Baby tears (Helxine soleiroli), a mosslike creeping plant with round leaves, often is grown as a ground cover. The trumpet tree (Cecropia peltata), a tropical American species that has hollow stems inhabited by biting ants, is an extremely aggressive invasive species.
