Celandine,  any of several distinct flowering plants of similar appearance, mostly members of the poppy family (Papaveraceae). Several species are grown as garden wildflowers.
The greater celandine (Chelidonium majus) is native to deciduous woods of Europe and Asia and is the only member of its genus. Once a valued plant of the Old World herbalist for its reputed power to remove warts, it was formerly known as wartweed. Its orange-coloured sap contains alkaloids that are possibly poisonous. The plants are herbaceous perennials with coarsely toothed divided leaves and four-petaled yellow blooms about 2.5 cm (1 inch) across. Celandine produces narrow, thin seed pods with many small shiny black seeds that have a white appendage known as an elaiosome. The appendage is attractive to ants, which aid in seed dispersal.
The celandine poppies, species of the genus Stylophorum, are native to North America and China. The plants resemble Chelidonium but have flowers twice the size and have two-paired much-divided leaves on the stem below the flower cluster and basal leaves. Celandine poppies have orange-yellow sap. Stylophorum diphyllum is the sole species of the genus in the Western Hemisphere; it is grown as a garden flower, as are several Asian species, in rich moist soil and partial shade.
The lesser celandine, or pilewort (Ranunculus ficaria), is a member of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). It has heart-shaped leaves and typical buttercup flowers. Native to Europe, it has become naturalized in North America.
