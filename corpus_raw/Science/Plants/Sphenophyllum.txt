Sphenophyllum,  genus of extinct plants that lived from the end of the Devonian Period to the beginning of the Triassic Period (about 360 to 251 million years ago); it is most commonly reconstructed as a shrub or a creeping vine. Sphenophyllum had a strong node-internode architecture, which has led some authorities to ally it with modern horsetails. Branches and leaves were arranged in whorls at each node much like the later Calamites; however, the leaves of Sphenophyllum were triangular in shape. Spore-bearing cones were also similar to those of Calamites and modern horsetails; however, Sphenophyllum lacked the hollow central stem that characterizes horsetail relatives because its tracheids, or water-conducting cells, were arranged in a central triangle surrounded by wood. Sphenophyllum grew in floodplain swamps, away from the margins of rivers.
