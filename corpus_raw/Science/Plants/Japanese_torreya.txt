Japanese torreya,  (Torreya nucifera), also called nut-bearing torreya or kaya,  an ornamental evergreen timber tree of the yew family (Taxaceae), native to the southern islands of Japan. Although it is the hardiest species of its genus and may be 10 to 25 metres (about 35 to 80 feet) tall, it assumes a shrubby form in less temperate areas. Spreading, horizontal, or slightly ascending branches give the tree a compact ovoid or pyramidal head. The bark is smooth and red but on old trees may become brownish and flaky. The curved, lance-shaped leaves are rigid, spiny pointed, and dark glossy green on the upper side; they emit a pungent, disagreeable odour when bruised. The seeds, 2 to 2.5 cm (about 0.75  to 1 inch) long, are used for food in Japan; they contain an oil used in cooking. The fleshy seed covering, or aril, is light green in colour, sometimes tinged with purple. The yellowish, durable wood is used for furniture, cabinetry, carving, and articles of turnery.
