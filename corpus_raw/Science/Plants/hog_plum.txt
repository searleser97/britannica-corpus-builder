The hog plum and several other species of the genus Spondias are cultivated for their edible plumlike fruits. The young leaves can also be eaten, and various parts of the plant are used in traditional medicine. The plants have naturalized in many parts of Africa and southeast Asia.
Hog plum is a deciduous tree reaching 15–22 metres (49–72 feet) in height. The bark is deeply fissured. The plant typically drops most of its compound leaves before flowering. The drupe fruits are about 4 cm (1.6 inches) in length and have a leathery yellow-green skin. The large stone in each fruit bears many spines and is difficult to separate from the pulp.
