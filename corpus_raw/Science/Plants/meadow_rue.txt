Meadow rue,  (genus Thalictrum),  genus of approximately 330 species of perennial herbaceous plants in the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). They occur in the North Temperate Zone and in South America and Africa, in wooded as well as in sunny, open areas.
The plantsâ€™ compound leaves consist of three ternately to pinnately compound stalked leaflets. The small fuzzy flowers, which grow in clusters, are often greenish, yellow, or purple, with four or five sepals; petals are absent.
The native American species, such as Thalictrum dioicum, also called quicksilver weed, and T. polygomum, also called muskrat weed, are grown as ornamentals in the wild garden. Some of the Eurasian species, however, are more showy, notably T. aquilegiofolium and T. delavayi.
