Buttercup,  (genus Ranunculus), also called crowfoot,  genus of about 300 species of herbaceous flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. Buttercups are distributed throughout the world and are especially common in woods and fields of the north temperate zone.
Most buttercups have tuberous or fibrous roots. The flowers are solitary or loosely clustered and have five green sepals, five to many glossy yellow (sometimes white) petals, and numerous male and female structures (stamens and pistils). Cultivated varieties have been bred in many colours. The leaves are highly variable, depending on the species.
The Persian buttercup (Ranunculus asiaticus) is the floristâ€™s ranunculus. Among the many wild species are the tall meadow buttercup (R. acris), native to Eurasia but widely introduced elsewhere; the swamp buttercup (R. hispidis) of eastern North American wetlands; and the Eurasian creeping buttercup, or butter daisy (R. repens), widely naturalized in America. Both the pond crowfoot (R. peltatus) and the common water crowfoot (R. aquatilis) have broad floating leaves and finely dissected submerged leaves.
