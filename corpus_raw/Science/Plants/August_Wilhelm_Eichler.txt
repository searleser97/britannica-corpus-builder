August Wilhelm Eichler,  (born April 22, 1839, Neukirchen, Hesse, Ger.—died  March 2, 1887, Berlin), German botanist who developed one of the first widely used natural systems of plant classification.
Eichler studied mathematics and natural science at the University of Marburg (Ph.D., 1861). He then went to Munich, where he became a private assistant to the naturalist Karl Friedrich Philipp von Martius, with whom he edited Flora Brasiliensis (15 vol., “The Flora of Brazil”), the first volume of which had appeared in 1861. After the death of Martius in 1868, Eichler worked on the Flora unassisted, issuing 46 of 100 parts. In 1865 he became a lecturer at the University of Munich and, six years later, professor of botany at the Technische Hochschule (Technical University) at Graz. In 1872 he received an appointment at the University of Kiel, where he remained until 1878, when he became director of the herbarium at the University of Berlin. That same year, the second and last volume of his Blütendiagramme appeared (first vol., 1875; “Diagrams of Flowers”), his principal contribution to the study of the comparative structure of flowers.
Eichler’s system of plant classification, developed in 1886, eventually won worldwide acceptance. He divided the plant kingdom into four divisions: Thallophyta (the algae and fungi), Bryophyta (the liverworts and mosses), Pteridophyta (the club mosses, horsetails, and ferns), and Spermatophyta (the seed plants), the last of which were in turn divided into two major categories: the angiosperms (the flowering plants) and gymnosperms (such as pines, spruces, and firs). Eichler’s system was eventually modified into a more natural system of classification.
