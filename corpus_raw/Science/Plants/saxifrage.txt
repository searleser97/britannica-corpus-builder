Saxifrage,  (genus Saxifraga), also called rockfoil,  any of a genus of flowering plants, of the family Saxifragaceae, native in temperate, subarctic, and alpine areas. About 300 species have been identified. Many of them are valued as rock-garden subjects, and some are grown in garden borders. As a group they are notable for their small bright flowers and fine-textured foliage. Alpine species are the earliest to flower in gardens.
Saxifraga virginiensis, S. pennsylvanica, and S. oregana constitute a few of the species that can be found growing wild in North America. Saxifraga callosa, S. cotyledon, and S. granulata, from Europe, have several varieties that are prized for their white to rose-pink, much-branched flower clusters. S. paniculata, which comes from the north temperate zone, has yielded a number of fine garden varieties, differing in size, leaf shape, and flower colour. Only one species is widely grown as a window and basket plant, S. stolonifera, a trailing plant with cascading runners. Its common names are strawberry begonia, strawberry geranium, and mother-of-thousands.
