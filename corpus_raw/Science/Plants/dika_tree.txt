Dika,  (Irvingia gabonensis), also called African mango, Gabon chocolate, orogbono,  tree of the family Irvingiaceae, native to western Africa, and its edible seeds. The seeds, commonly called dika nuts, are used principally for food and oil and in weight loss supplements. The fleshy fruit somewhat resembles the unrelated mango and is eaten fresh or processed into jellies and jams. The tree produces a hard wood that is useful for heavy construction.
The dika is a large tree with a dense evergreen crown and large buttresses. The simple leaves are asymmetrical and glossy on the upper surface. The bisexual flowers are yellow to pale greenish and are borne in small clusters. The fruit is a large edible drupe with thick fibrous flesh.
The seed kernels are commonly roasted like coffee beans, then pounded and poured into a mold before being added to boiling meat and vegetables. The seeds are also used to adulterate chocolate and ground to make flour. The fat is extracted from the seeds for soap and candlemaking. A relish made from the dika nut is customarily eaten with plantains.
