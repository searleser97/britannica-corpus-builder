Mulberry,  (genus Morus),  genus of about 10 species of small to medium-sized trees in the family Moraceae and their sweet edible fruits. Mulberries are native to temperate Asia and North America, and several species are cultivated for their fruits and as ornamentals. Mulberry plants are also important as food for silkworms.
Mulberries are deciduous and have toothed, sometimes lobed leaves that are alternately arranged along the stems. Individuals can be monoecious (bearing both male and female flowers) or dioecious (bearing only male or female flowers). The minute flowers are borne in tight catkin clusters. Each fruit develops from an entire flower cluster and is formally known as a multiple. The fruits somewhat resemble blackberries and ripen to white, pink, red, or purple.
The red mulberry (Morus rubra) of eastern North America is the largest of the genus, often reaching a height of 21 metres (70 feet). It has two-lobed, three-lobed, or unlobed leaves and dark purple edible fruits.
White mulberry (M. alba), native to Asia but long cultivated in southern Europe, is so called because of the white fruits it bears; its leaves are used as food for silkworms. It is naturalized in eastern North America. Several useful varieties of the white mulberry are the cold-resistant Russian mulberry (M. alba, variety tatarica), introduced into western North America for shelterbelts and local timber use, and fruitless sorts such as the ‘Stribling’ and ‘Mapleleaf’ cultivars. The weeping mulberry (M. alba ‘Pendula’) is frequently used as a lawn tree.
Black mulberry (M. nigra), the most common species, is a native of western Asia that spread westward in cultivation at an early period. Up to the 15th century it was extensively grown in Italy for raising silkworms, but it has since been superseded by white mulberry. Now an introduced species in North America, it is mainly cultivated for its large juicy purple-black fruits, which are superior in flavour to those of red mulberry.
