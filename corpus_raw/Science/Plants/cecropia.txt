Cecropia,  (genus Cecropia),  several species of tropical tree of the family Cecropiaceae common to the understory layer of disturbed forest habitats of Central and South America. It is easily recognized by its thin, white-ringed trunk and umbrella-like arrangement of large leaves at the branch tips. These extremely fast-growing trees are colonizers of forest gaps or clearings. They usually live about 30 years and grow to less than 18 metres (60 feet), producing a very soft wood in the process. Trees are either male or female, with the female producing nearly one million seeds every time it fruits. Flowers are very small and borne on elongated, hanging structures called catkins.
The cecropia’s interaction with Azteca ants is a classic case of defense mutualism in the tropics. The tree provides the ants with a nest consisting of multiple chambers within the stems as the ants burrow through the soft internal tissue. Food is also provided to the ants in the form of glycogen-containing structures that the tree produces at the base of its leaves. The food bodies are produced in the greatest quantity under young leaves. Ants patrol these areas and prevent insects from damaging this foliage. Some ant species also benefit the tree by actively cutting vines that grow onto the tree.
In spite of such an elaborate defense, cecropias attract a wide variety of birds and other animals that feed on fruit, flowers, or leaves. Sloths even prefer to feed on cecropia trees, as the ants do not seem concerned with the main leaf surfaces or external wood surfaces. (See rainforest ecosystem sidebar, “A Moving Habitat.”)
