Wheatgrass,  (genus Agropyron),  genus of wheatlike grasses in the family Poaceae, found throughout the North Temperate Zone. Several species, including desert wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum) and crested wheatgrass (A. cristatum), are good forage plants and are often used as soil binders in the western United States. Wheatgrass is also the name of juice derived from seedlings of true wheat (Triticum aestivum), sometimes consumed as a health food.
Wheatgrass plants typically are perennials and range from 30 to 100 cm (about 12 to 40 inches) tall. Many have creeping rhizomes (underground stems) and spread vegetatively. The leaves are flat or somewhat rolled, and the tiny flowers are borne in spikelike inflorescences. A number of species are drought-tolerant and can survive in saline soils.
The genus has undergone significant taxonomic revision, and many former species are now placed in other grass genera. These include bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata, formerly Agropyron spicatum), western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii, formerly A. smithii), and slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus, formerly A. trachycaulum), all of which are useful forage plants.
