Squill,  (genus Scilla),  genus of about 100 species of bulbous plants (family Asparagaceae, formerly Hyacinthaceae) native to temperate Eurasia. Some spring-flowering species are cultivated as garden ornamentals. Siberian squill (Scilla siberica) has escaped cultivation and is considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range.
The narrow, sometimes grasslike leaves arise in the spring from an underground bulb. The small white, blue, or purple flowers are borne in a cluster at the tip of a leafless flower stalk. The fruit is a many-seeded capsule.
