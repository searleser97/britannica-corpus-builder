Ironweed,   any of about 500 species of perennial plants constituting the genus Vernonia of the family Asteraceae. Small herbaceous species are distributed throughout the world, while shrubs and trees are native primarily to tropical regions.
Members of the genus have lance-shaped, toothed leaves that alternate along the stem; clusters of flower heads composed only of disk flowers (no ray flowers); and a ring of overlapping bracts (leaflike structures) below the flower heads. Some autumn-blooming species are cultivated as border plants for their attractive white, purple, or pink flower clusters.
