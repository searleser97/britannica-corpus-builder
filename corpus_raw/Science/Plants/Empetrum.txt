Crowberry,  (genus Empetrum),  genus of three species of low evergreen shrubs of the heath family (Ericaceae). The plants thrive in subarctic, alpine, and boreal regions and produce juicy edible fruits that are somewhat acidic in taste.
Crowberries grow about 25 cm (10 inches) tall and are somewhat trailing in habit. The narrow simple leaves are about 1 cm (0.4 inch) long and somewhat succulent. The flowers are very small and purplish pink. The fruits are true berries, about 1 cm long, and range from reddish to purple to black, depending on the species.
Crowberry, or black crowberry Empetrum nigrum), is native to cool regions of North America, Asia, and Europe and is the most common species of the genus. Purple crowberry, or rockberry (E. eamesii), is found in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, and red crowberry (E. rubrum) is native to Chile, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands.
