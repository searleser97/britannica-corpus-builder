brassica,  (genus Brassica),  genus of 37 species of flowering plants in the mustard family (Brassicaceae), many of which are important agricultural crops. Brassicas are native to Europe and temperate Asia and are especially common in the Mediterranean region; some are considered invasive species in areas outside their native range. Economically important members include broccoli, brown mustard, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, kohlrabi, rape, rutabaga, and turnip.
Brassica plants are pungent herbs with a diversity of growth habits. The plants generally have lobed or entire leaves, arranged alternately, and are often waxy and bluish green in colour. Many species are biennials. The four-petaled flowers are usually borne in clusters and bear dry fruits known as siliques or silicles, depending on their length.
