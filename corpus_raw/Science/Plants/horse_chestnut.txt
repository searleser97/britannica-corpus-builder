Horse chestnut,   any of several trees belonging to the genus Aesculus in the horse chestnut family (Hippocastanaceae), native to the North Temperate Zone. They have palmately compound leaves and erect flower clusters, often in the shape of an inverted cone. Prickly green husks ripen and split in fall to release one or two shiny mahogany-brown nuts. The tree’s common name is said to come from Turkey, where the nuts were fed to horses to cure broken wind.
Perhaps the best-known species is the common, or European, horse chestnut (A. hippocastanum), native to southeastern Europe but widely cultivated as a large shade and street tree; it grows to a height of 30 m (100 feet). The Champs-Élysées in Paris is lined with rows of horse-chestnut trees.
Japanese horse chestnut (A. turbinata) is as tall as the European species but is distinctive for its remarkably large leaves, up to 60 cm (2 feet) across. The Indian horse chestnut (A. indica), with slender, pointed leaflets, has attractive feathery flower spikes with a bottlebrush effect. Red horse chestnut (A. × carnea), a hybrid of A. hippocastanum and A. pavia, grows up to 20 m (65 feet) and has flesh-coloured to scarlet flower spikes.
