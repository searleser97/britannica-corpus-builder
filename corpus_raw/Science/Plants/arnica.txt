Arnica,  (genus Arnica),  genus of some 30 species of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae), most of which occur in the mountains of northwestern North America. Arnica species are perennial herbs that grow 10–70 cm (4–28 inches) tall. The simple leaves are oppositely arranged with toothed or smooth margins and often feature glandular trichomes (hairs). The composite flower heads are generally yellow and produce achene fruits (a type of simple dry fruit) with a pappus (bristles) for dispersal. Several species have rhizomes. Though fairly common in homeopathic and folk medicine, Arnica is toxic and can cause fatal poisoning if taken internally.
One of the most important species, mountain arnica (Arnica montana), is a perennial herb of northern and central European highlands. It yields an essential oil formerly used in treating bruises and sprains and is often grown as a garden ornamental. Narrowleaf arnica (A. angustifolia) of Arctic Asia and America has orange-yellow flower heads 5–7 cm (2–2.5 inches) across and is a protected species in some countries.
