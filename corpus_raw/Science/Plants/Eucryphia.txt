Eucryphia,   genus of evergreen shrubs and trees, constituting the family Eucryphiaceae, with about five species native to Australia and Chile. They are planted in warm regions for their foliage and showy camellia-like cream-white flowers, which appear in late summer and fall.
E. cordifolia, which grows to a height of 12 m (40 feet), and E. glutinosa, up to 4.5 m (14.8 feet), have produced the hybrid E. Ã—nymansensis, hardier than E. cordifolia and tolerant of alkaline soils.
