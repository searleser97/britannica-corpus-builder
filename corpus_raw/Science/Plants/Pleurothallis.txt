Pleurothallis,  large genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae) native to tropical and temperate areas of the Americas. A number of species are known as bonnet orchids and are grown for their attractive hooded flowers. Others, such as Pleurothallis leptotifolia and P. rowleei, are diminutive plants and are cultivated as novelties for their small size.
Pleurothallis species are usually epiphytes, though some are terrestrial orchids. The plants range greatly in size. The flowers may be solitary or borne on a short spike and are primarily in tints and shades of yellow combined with white, red, green, or brown. The widow orchid (P. macrophylla) is a dark, deep purple.
