India rubber plant,  (Ficus elastica), also called India rubber tree,  large tree of the family Moraceae, once an important source of an inferior natural rubber. It was largely replaced as a source of rubber by the unrelated rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) in the early 20th century. The India rubber plant is native to Southeast Asia and is commonly grown as an indoor pot plant elsewhere. The young plants are durable and grow well under less-than-ideal indoor conditions.
The India rubber plant has large, thick, oblong leaves up to 30 cm (12 inches) long and figlike fruits in pairs along the branches. The trunk and stems exude a milky sap, or latex. Among the cultivated varieties offered are ‘Decora,’ with broader and darker green leaves, and a few variegated strains, with marbled gray, cream, and white leaves or with green leaves having white or yellow margins.
