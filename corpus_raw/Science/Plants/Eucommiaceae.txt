Eucommiaceae,  family of dicotyledonous flowering plants comprising the single species Eucommia ulmoides in the order Garryales. It is an elmlike tree native to temperate regions of central and eastern China that is notable for its milky latex from which rubber can be produced.
Eucommia is cultivated as an ornamental in mild climates, though it is rare and listed as near-threatened in its native habitat because of overharvesting. The bark has medicinal properties and is valued especially by the Chinese. The species is also of interest for its isolated evolutionary position, as reflected in its status as a single-species family.
In addition to latex and deciduous leaves, the species is characterized by the presence of simple, toothed leaves produced alternately along the stems. The flowers are solitary and unisexual and lack both petals and sepals. The male flowers have 6 to 10 stamens (pollen-producing structures), and the female flowers have one ovary composed of two carpels, one of which aborts during development. The fruit thus contains only one seed and is a samara (a dry, winged structure).
