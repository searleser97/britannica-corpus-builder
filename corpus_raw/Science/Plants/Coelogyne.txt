Coelogyne,  genus of as many as 200 species of orchids (family Orchidaceae), found throughout Asia and on some Pacific islands. Coelogyne species are primarily epiphytic. Some live on rocks, soil, or dead trees. A number of species grow well in cool climates, and some are cultivated.
All members of the genus have pseudobulbs (bulblike stems) with one or two leaves and a spike of flowers. The flowers range in size from small to large and showy, depending on the species, and are commonly white, tan, or green in colour. Some are fragrant.
C. cristata, native to the Himalayas, has a beautiful white flower with golden hairs on its crested lip. Somewhat similar in appearance is C. flaccida, which can produce numerous inflorescences of attractive white or tawny flowers with a yellow lip. The black orchid (C. pandurata) has black velvety markings on its fiddle-shaped central labellum (modified petal); it bears from 5 to 15 greenish yellow flowers.
