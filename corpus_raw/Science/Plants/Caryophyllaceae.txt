Caryophyllaceae,  the pink, or carnation, family of flowering plants (order Caryophyllales), comprising some 100 genera and 2,200 species. The plants are mainly of north temperate distribution, and a number are cultivated as garden ornamentals and as cut flowers for the floral industry.
The members are diverse in appearance and habitat, and they are largely herbaceous annuals and perennials. Most species have swollen leaf and stem joints. The flowers have five sepals and five petals, but it is thought that the latter are in origin modified stamens. There are usually 5 or 10 stamens, with an ovary borne above them. The ovules are borne in the centre of the ovary, and there are usually no walls dividing the ovary cavity. The five sepals are joined, forming a tube, in Silene and its relatives.
The largest genus of the family is Silene, known commonly as campion or catchfly. It comprises some 900 species distributed throughout the world. Several are ornamental rock-garden or border plants, including the showy bladder campion (S. vulgaris).
Most valued horticulturally is the genus Dianthus, commonly known as pinks. Notable members include the carnation (D. caryophyllus), commonly cultivated by florists and also grown in Europe for use in perfumes; sweet William (D. barbatus), an old-fashioned garden flower; and the cottage, or grass, pink (D. plumarius). See also baby’s breath; campion; chickweed. 
Several of the 150 species of the genus Gypsophila are important to the floral industry for their small misty flowers known as baby’s breath.
The genus Stellaria, with about 100 species, includes the common chickweed, or stitchwort (S. media), a widely naturalized lawn weed.
Other important genera include sandwort (Arenaria), Cerastium (about 200 species), and soapwort (Saponaria; 40 species).
