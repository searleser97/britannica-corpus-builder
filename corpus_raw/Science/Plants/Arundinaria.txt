Arundinaria,  genus of bamboos and canes in the grass family (Poaceae), found in temperate areas. The plants typically grow in marshy areas or along riverbanks, and the stems can be woven into baskets and mats and are used to make pipes and fishing poles. The taxonomy of the genus is contentious, and the exact number of species and their distribution remains unresolved.
Arundinaria species are woody perennials and range in height from 0.5–8 metres (1.6–26 feet). Most species spread vegetatively with creeping rhizomes (underground stems) and can form dense colonies that exclude other plants. The cylindrical stems are characterized by persistent leaf sheaths with stiff rough bristles; the leaves are long and narrow. New stems produce a distinctive fan of leaves known as a top knot. Sexual reproduction is rare, and colonies typically die after flowering and producing seed.
Giant cane, also known as river cane and canebrake bamboo (Arundinaria gigantea), was once widely utilized as a forage plant in the southeastern United States, from eastern Texas and Oklahoma to the Atlantic coast and north to the Ohio River valley. It produces green leaves and stems throughout the year and is valued for winter forage along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Giant cane grows in thickets and canebrakes in moist, fertile soil and thrives especially along riverbanks and in bottomlands.
