Albert Francis Blakeslee,  (born Nov. 9, 1874, Geneseo, N.Y., U.S.—died  Nov. 16, 1954, Northampton, Mass.), prominent American botanist and geneticist who achieved world renown for his research on plants.
The son of a Methodist minister, Blakeslee was awarded a B.A., cum laude, from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Conn. (1896). After three years of teaching mathematics and science in a preparatory school, he entered Harvard University (1899) for graduate work. In 1900 he received his M.A. and in 1904 his Ph.D. His doctoral thesis, which was published the same year and entitled “Sexual Reproduction in the Mucorineae,” brought him immediate distinction because of his discovery and elucidation of sexuality in the lower fungi.
Until 1914 Blakeslee served as professor of botany at the Connecticut Agricultural College at Storrs, where he continued his experimental work, but with higher plants rather than fungi. In 1915 he took a position as resident investigator in plant genetics at the Carnegie Institution experimental laboratories at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, N.Y.; by 1936 he had become director. On his retirement from the Carnegie Institution (1941), Blakeslee was appointed professor of botany at Smith College, Northampton, Mass., where he established the Genetics Experimental Station. His joint work with graduate students and research associates resulted in the publication of a long series of papers on the genetics and cytology of Datura stramonium, the jimsonweed. Among other important discoveries, Blakeslee used colchicine to achieve an increase in the number of chromosomes and thus opened up a new field of artificially produced polyploids.
