Kumquat,  (genus Fortunella),  genus of evergreen shrubs or trees of the family Rutaceae, grown for their tart orange fruits. Native to eastern Asia, these small trees are cultivated throughout the subtropics. Kumquat fruits may be eaten fresh, or they may be preserved and made into jams and jellies. In China they are frequently candied. Branches of the kumquat tree are used for Christmas decoration in parts of the United States and elsewhere.
Kumquat plants reach about 2.4 to 3.6 metres (8 to 12 feet) high. The branches are mainly thornless and have glossy dark green leaves and white flowers, occurring singly or clustered in the leaf axils. The bright orange-yellow fruit is round or oval, about 2.5 cm (1 inch) in diameter, with mildly acid juicy pulp and a sweet, edible, pulpy skin.
The oval, or Nagami, kumquat (Fortunella margarita) is the most common species. It is native to southern China and bears yellowish orange fruits that are about 3 cm (1.2 inches) in diameter. The round, or Marumi, kumquat is F. japonica; it is indigenous to Japan and has orangelike fruits that are about 2.5 cm in diameter. The egg-shaped Meiwa kumquat (F. crassifolia), in which both the pulp and the rind of the fruit are sweet, is widely grown in China. In the United States, hybrids have been produced with limes, mandarin oranges, and other citrus fruits.
