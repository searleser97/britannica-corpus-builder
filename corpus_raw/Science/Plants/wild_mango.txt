Wild mango,  (genus Irvingia),  genus of several species of tropical African trees of the family Irvingiaceae. Dika (Irvingia gabonensis) and other species (such as I. wombolu) are notable for their edible yellow fruit, which somewhat resembles the unrelated mango (Mangifera indica). Dika seeds are rich in a fat used locally to make both bread and a type of butter. The wood is very hard and is used locally in building construction.
