Cereus,  (genus Cereus),  genus of about 30 species of large columnar cacti (family Cactaceae) native to South America. The common name cereus is also broadly applied to any number of “ceroid cacti,” which have elongated bodies; many such cacti are designated with scientific epithets that include the suffix “-cereus” (e.g., Hylocereus, Pachycereus, Selenicereus, and Stenocereus).
Members of the genus Cereus are generally shrub- or treelike cacti with 4–10 ribs on each stem. The ribs are lined with rows of large areoles, each of which is armed with several stout spines. The large white flowers are fragrant and night-blooming. The spherical or oblong fruits are fleshy and usually devoid of spines; the fruits of some species are edible.
The genus Selenicereus, night-blooming cereus or moonlight cactus, containing about 20 species, is known for its usually fragrant large night-blooming white flowers, among the largest in the cactus family. The queen-of-the-night (S. grandiflorus), the best-known night-blooming cereus, is often grown indoors. The saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) and the organ pipe cactus (Stenocereus thurberi) are also sometimes referred to as cereus.
