Balloon vine, also called Heart-pea, or Heart-seed,  (species Cardiospermum halicacabum), woody perennial vine in the soapberry family (Sapindaceae) that is native to subtropical and tropical America. It is naturalized and cultivated widely as an ornamental for its white flowers and its nearly globular inflated fruits, which are about 2.5 cm (1 inch) across. The seeds are black with a heart-shaped white spot. The vine can reach an extension of 3 m (10 feet) as a perennial but is usually grown from seed as an annual.
