Zygopetalum,  genus of 15 species of tropical American orchids (family Orchidaceae). Several species are cultivated as ornamentals, and a number of attractive hybrids have been developed. Two similar species, Zygopetalum mackayi and Z. intermedium, are commonly grown for their long-lasting fragrant flowers.
Most species are epiphytic (grow on other plants) and have egg-shaped pseudobulbs (swollen stems) that bear two or more long thin leaves. The flowering spike is often 60 cm (24 inches) tall. Zygopetalum flowers have green petals and sepals, spotted with purple or brown, and typically feature a white lip streaked with purple.
