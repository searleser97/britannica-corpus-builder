Paper mulberry,  (Broussonetia papyrifera),  fast-growing tree 
of the family Moraceae, native to Asia. The inner bark of the paper mulberry yields a fibre used for papermaking and in Polynesia for the manufacture of a coarse fabric called tapa cloth. The plant tolerates city conditions and is available in several varieties (cut-leaved, white-fruited, and variegated) that find use as hardy ornamentals and in naturalized landscapes. It may also be grown in pots or in conservatories and succeeds best in a rich, deep, and somewhat moist loam. It is considered an invasive species in some areas outside of its native range.
