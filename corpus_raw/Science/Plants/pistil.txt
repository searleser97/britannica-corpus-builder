Pistil,  the female reproductive part of a flower. The pistil, centrally located, typically consists of a swollen base, the ovary, which contains the potential seeds, or ovules; a stalk, or style, arising from the ovary; and a pollen-receptive tip, the stigma, variously shaped and often sticky. In pollination, compatible pollen grains land on the stigma and then germinate, forming a pollen tube. The pollen tube grows down through the tissue of the style to deposit sperm for the fertilization of the ovules in the ovary. Pistils in the collective sense form the gynoecium, in distinction to the male reproductive parts, or androecium (see stamen).
Each pistil is constructed of from one to many enrolled leaflike structures, or carpels, each of which encloses one or more ovules. The carpel is a single megasporophyll, or modified seed-bearing leaf. A pistil then may be composed of one carpel (simple pistil), as in the sweet pea, or of two or more carpels (compound pistil) partially or completely joined, as in the mustard (two carpels) or lily (three carpels). A flower that contains separate pistils (and therefore separate carpels) is termed apocarpous. If it contains a single pistil with two or more united carpels, it is syncarpous.
Differences in the composition and form of the pistil are useful in determining taxonomic relationships. There may be a single pistil, as in the lily, or several to many pistils, as in the buttercup. The lobes of the stigma are often characteristic of families or genera; for example, many bellflowers (Campanula) have a distinctive stigma with three curling lobes.
