Chive,  (Allium schoenoprasum),  small perennial plant of the amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae), related to the onion. Chives are grown as ornamentals for their attractive flowers and as a potherb for their flavourful leaves. The leaves can be used fresh or dried and are a common seasoning for eggs, soups, salads, and vegetables.
Chives bear small white elongated bulbs and thin tubular leaves, which grow in clumps. Dense spherical umbels of bluish or lilac flowers rise above the foliage. They characteristically produce only a few seeds. Chives may be propagated by planting seeds but are cultivated more commonly by dividing the clumps and planting the tiny bulbs.
