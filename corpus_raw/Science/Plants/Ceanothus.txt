Ceanothus americanus, commonly called New Jersey tea, occurs from Canada to Florida. During the American Revolutionary War, its leaves were used as a tea substitute. The plant grows about 1 m (3 feet) tall and has deciduous, rather oval leaves. The white flowers grow in a flat-topped cluster.
C. arboreus, called Catalina, or felt-leaf, ceanothus, an evergreen tree occurring on the islands off the coast of California, has leaves with a dark green upper surface and a dense white pubescence beneath. The tree, 5â€“8 m high, bears fragrant blue flowers in the early spring.
