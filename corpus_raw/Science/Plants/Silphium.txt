Silphium,  genus of tall perennial plants in the family Asteraceae, consisting of about 23 yellow-flowered species commonly called rosinweed, native to North America. Many species have rough leaves that may be opposite each other, alternate along the stem, or be grouped in whorls.
The base of each oval cup-plant (Silphium perfoliatum) leaf surrounds the square stem and may hold water. Compass plant, or pilotweed (S. laciniatum), is a prairie plant with large, deeply cut, lance-shaped leaves. It may grow to 3.5 metres (about 12 feet) and has a tall flower stalk with solitary large flowers.
