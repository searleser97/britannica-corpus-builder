Persimmon,  either of two trees of the genus Diospyros (family Ebenaceae) and their edible fruits. Persimmons are eaten fresh as a dessert fruit, often with sugar or liqueur, or are stewed or cooked as jam.
The Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kaki), an important and extensively grown fruit in China and Japan, where it is known as kaki, was introduced into France and other Mediterranean countries in the 19th century and grown to a limited extent there. Introduced into the United States a little later, it is now grown commercially in California and in the Gulf states, mainly in home gardens. The fruit, 5–8 cm (2–3 inches) or more in diameter, yellow to red in colour, somewhat resembles a tomato in appearance and contains vitamin A with lesser amounts of vitamin C. Except for such varieties as Fuyu, the fruit tends to be highly astringent until soft-ripe. The trees will tolerate temperatures down to about −18 °C (0 °F).
The American persimmon (D. virginiana) is a small tree, occasionally up to 10 metres (33 feet) in height, that grows from the Gulf states north to central Pennsylvania and central Illinois. The fruit is 3–5 cm (1.2–2 inches) in diameter, usually rather flattened, and dark red to maroon in colour. Most fruits contain several rather large flattened seeds. The American persimmon’s fruit is generally considered more flavourful in its softened state than the Japanese species, and considerable quantities are gathered from the wild. A number of superior kinds have been named and propagated and are grown commercially.
