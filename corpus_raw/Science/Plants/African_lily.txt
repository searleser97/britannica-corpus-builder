Lily of the Nile,  (Agapanthus africanus), also called African lily,  perennial herbaceous plant of the amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae), native to Africa. Lily of the Nile is a common ornamental in warm climates, grown for its large spherical flower clusters. The flowers are funnel-shaped and typically blue, purple, or white in colour; the clusters are borne on long stalks. The attractive, thick, dark green leaves are sword-shaped. If grown in a climate with frost, they must be kept in containers and moved indoors to survive the cold weather.
