Silvergrass,  (genus Miscanthus), also spelled silver grass,  genus of about 10 species of tall perennial grasses in the family Poaceae, native primarily to southeastern Asia. Eulalia, or Chinese silvergrass (Miscanthus sinensis), and several other species sometimes are grown as lawn or border ornamentals for their silvery or white plumelike flower clusters; the dried heads often are used in decoration. Giant miscanthus (M. Ã—giganteus) is a potential biofuel and biomass crop.
Silvergrasses are typically large reed or canelike grasses with long straplike leaves. The leaves of ornamental varieties often have yellow or white stripes or bands. The inflorescences feature fan-shaped branches, and the paired flower spikelets are characteristically surrounded by silky hairs. Several species spread vegetatively with rhizomes (underground stems).
