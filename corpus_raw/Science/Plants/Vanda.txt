Vanda,  genus of about 50 species of colourful orchids (family Orchidaceae) distributed from East Asia to Australia. Many attractive hybrids have been developed by crossing species within the genus and also by crossing Vanda species with those of other orchid genera.
Most species are epiphytic and have long sturdy stems that bear closely spaced straplike leaves. Some species have cylindrical leaves in a form known as terete. Vanda flowers usually are flat and have a short spur on the lip; the flowers are long-lasting and often fragrant. The plants grow well in warm temperatures with high humidity and require a well-draining potting medium.
One of the most beautiful species, waling-waling (V. sanderiana), is native to the Philippines and is often used in hybridization. The bluish-flowered blue vanda (V. coerulea) and the dark-spotted V. tricolor are other well-known species.
