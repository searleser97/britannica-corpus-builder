Crabapple, also spelled crab apple, also called crab,  any of several small trees of the genus Malus, in the rose family (Rosaceae). Crabapples are native to North America and Asia. They are widely grown for their attractive growth habit, spring flower display, and decorative fruit. The fruits are much smaller and more tart than the common apple (Malus domestica) but are suitable for jellies, preserves, and cider.
Crabapple trees are stiffer in form and spinier than the common apple. The plants are deciduous and often have attractive fall foliage. The fragrant, five-petaled, white, pink, carmine, or purplish flowers appear early in showy masses, some species and cultivars producing semi-double (6â€“10 petals) or double (more than 10 petals) blossoms. The pome fruits often persist throughout the winter and are generally less than 5 cm (2 inches) in diameter.
Outstanding Asian crabapples include the Chinese flowering crab (M. spectabilis), Siberian crabapple (M. baccata), Toringo crabapple (M. sieboldii), and Japanese flowering crabapple (M. floribunda). Among the notable American species are the garland, or sweet crab (M. coronaria); Oregon crabapple (M. fusca); prairie crabapple (M. ioensis); and southern crabapple (M. angustifolia).
The showiest crabapples, hybrids derived from M. floribunda, are among the choicest small hardy decorative trees; many have large fragrant blossoms and bear colourful fruit that persists well into winter. Certain cultivated varieties of both the Asian and American crabapples are susceptible to cedar apple rust, apple scab, and fire blight, but hybrids with tolerance or resistance to those diseases have been developed.
