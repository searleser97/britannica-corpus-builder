Sapodilla,  (Manilkara zapota),  tropical evergreen tree (family Sapotaceae) and its distinctive fruit, native to southern Mexico, Central America, and parts of the Caribbean. Though of no great commercial importance in any part of the world, the sapodilla is much appreciated in many tropical and subtropical areas, where it is eaten fresh. The milky latex from the tree trunk was once important in the chewing-gum industry as the chief source of chicle; it was also used as chewing gum by the Aztecs. Elaborately carved lintels of sapodilla wood, some 1,000 years old, are still seen in some Mayan ruins.
As a cultivated species, the sapodilla tree is medium-sized and slow-growing. The reddish wood is hard and durable. The leaves, 5–12.5 cm (2–5 inches) long, are glossy and light green in colour and ovate to elliptic in outline; the flowers are small and inconspicuous. The fruit is spheroid to ovoid in shape, rusty brown on the surface, and roughly 5–10 cm (2–4 inches) in diameter. Its sweet flavour has been compared to a combination of pears and brown sugar. When the fruit is ripe, the seeds—two to five in number, shiny black, and the size of flattened beans—are surrounded by translucent, yellowish brown, juicy flesh. When the fruit is immature, its flesh contains both tannin and milky latex and is unpalatable. Propagation is usually by means of seed, but superior trees can be reproduced by grafting.
