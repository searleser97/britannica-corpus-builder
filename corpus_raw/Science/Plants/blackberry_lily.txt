It is native to East Asia and is naturalized in some parts of North America. Despite its name, the plant is not a true lily; it was formerly known as Belamcanda chinensis.
The blackberry lily  has branching stems, lower grassy foliage, and a stout rhizomatous rootstalk. The red-spotted orange flowers have six petallike segments.  The capsule wall of the fruit recurves at maturity to display shiny black seeds resembling the fruit of the blackberry.
