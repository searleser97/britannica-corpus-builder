Hedgehog cactus,  (genus Echinocereus),  genus of about 60 species of cacti (family Cactaceae), native from central Mexico to the western United States. The common name hedgehog refers to the spiny fruit, which is edible in many species.
Hedgehog cacti are usually cylindroid and many-stemmed and are often soft-bodied. The spine-bearing tubercles are joined to one another and form ribs. The large flowers generally have green stigma lobes and are commonly red and yellow in colour.
The small-flowered hedgehog cactus (Echinocereus viridiflorus), with small fragrant green to brown flowers, is the northernmost group, growing from Mexico to Wyoming and South Dakota. The claret cup (E. triglochidiatus) ranges from north of Mexico City to northern Utah and southern Colorado.
