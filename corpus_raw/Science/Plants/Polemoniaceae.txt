Polemoniaceae,  the phlox family of plants, comprising about 18 genera and some 385 species of flowering plants in the order Ericales. Members of the family are mostly in North America but also found in temperate parts of western South America and Eurasia. They include many popular garden ornamentals, including scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata), various phlox species (Phlox), and Jacobâ€™s ladder (Polemonium caeruleum).
Most Polemoniaceae members are herbaceous annuals or perennials, though some are woody. The tubular, five-lobed, funnel-shaped or flaring flowers are gathered into clusters or heads. They usually have three-chambered ovaries with styles topped by three narrow stigmas.
