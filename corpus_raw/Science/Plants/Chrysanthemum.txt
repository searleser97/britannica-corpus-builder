Chrysanthemum,  (genus Chrysanthemum),  genus of about 40 species of flowering plants in the aster family (Asteraceae), native primarily to subtropical and temperate areas of the Old World. Chrysanthemums are especially common in East Asia, where they are often depicted in art. Cultivated species, often called mums, are grown as fall-blooming ornamentals and are important in the floral industry. Florists’ chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum ×morifolium) has more than 100 cultivars, including button, pompon, daisy, and spider forms.
Most plants of the genus are perennial herbs or subshrubs. Many have simple aromatic leaves that alternate along the stem. Some have both disk and ray flowers in the heads, but others lack ray or disk flowers. Cultivated species and hybrids usually have large flower heads; those of wild species are much smaller.
The taxonomy of the genus is contentious and has undergone a number of revisions. Species formerly included in the genus Chrysanthemum include corn marigold (Glebionis segetum); costmary (Tanacetum balsamita); feverfew (T. parthenium); tansy (T. vulgare); Marguerite, or Paris daisy (Argyranthemum frutescens); and Shasta daisy (hybrid forms of Leucanthemum maximum).
