Chaste tree,  (Vitex agnus-castus), also called lilac chaste tree, chaste berry, monk’s pepper tree, or wild lavender,   aromatic shrub of the mint family (Lamiaceae; formerly placed in Verbenaceae), native to Eurasia. Its pliable twigs are used in basketry. Its fruits are used for flavouring and in herbal medicine to treat menstrual cycle problems. The plant gets its name from the belief that it is an anaphrodisiac (decreases libido). It is cultivated in warm climates for its foliage and showy flower spikes that attract butterflies and other pollinators.
The chaste tree grows up to 5 metres (about 16 feet) tall and can be maintained as a low shrub. The undersides of its five- to seven-lobed leaves and its branches are white felted. It bears spikes of small rose-lavender flowers arranged in whorls along the inflorescence. Although sometimes referred to as “berries,” the red fruits are drupes with a single seed.
