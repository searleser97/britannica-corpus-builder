Cauliflower,  (Brassica oleracea, variety botrytis),  highly modified form of cabbage in the mustard family (Brassicaceae), grown for its edible masses of partially developed flower structures and fleshy stalks. Cauliflower is high in vitamins C and K and is frequently served as a cooked vegetable or used raw in salads and relishes.
Cauliflowers are annual plants that reach about 0.5 metre (1.5 feet) tall and bear large rounded leaves that resemble collards (Brassica oleracea, variety acephala). As desired for food, the terminal cluster forms a firm, succulent “curd,” or head, that is an immature inflorescence (cluster of flowers). The broad leaves extend far above the curd and are often tied together before harvest to shade the curd and prevent discoloration. Commercially, white cauliflower is the most common, though orange, purple, green, and brown cultivars also exist. The plants produce cross-shaped yellow flowers and bear seeds in dry capsules known as siliques.
Cauliflower is a cool-weather crop and requires consistent temperatures of about 16 °C (60 °F) to produce heads. The plants grow best in moist nitrogen-rich soil and will produce only small heads if stressed with drought. Clubroot, a fungal disease, is a common problem for cauliflower crops, and the plants are fairly susceptible to a number of foliage-eating insects, including cabbage loopers, cabbage whites, and aphids.
