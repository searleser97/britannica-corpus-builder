Hawkweed,  any of the weedy plants of the genus Hieracium of the family Asteraceae, containing more than 100 species (more than 10,000 species, or microspecies, if tiny variations are considered to be separate species) native to temperate regions of the world. Mouse-ear hawkweed (H. pilosella), orange hawkweed (H. aurantiacum), and common hawkweed (H. vulgatum) are widely distributed weeds.
Some species are cultivated as garden ornamentals for their attractive flower clusters. They are variously known as devilâ€™s paintbrush, golden lungwort, mouse-ear, rattlesnake weed, and shaggy, orange, or narrow-leaved hawkweed.
