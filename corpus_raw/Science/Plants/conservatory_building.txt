Conservatory,  in architecture, building in which tender plants are protected and displayed, usually attached to and directly entered from a dwelling. It was not until the 19th century that a conservatory was distinguished from a greenhouse, also a building in which tender plants are cultivated but sited in the working area of the garden.
The conservatory was a direct descendant of the orangery, and, like the orangery, it became a decorative architectural feature proclaiming the status of its owner. Its great period was represented by the Palm House at Kew Gardens, London, and by Joseph Paxtonâ€™s Crystal Palace, designed for the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London and modelled on a conservatory he had designed earlier.
