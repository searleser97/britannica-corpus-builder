sage,  (Salvia officinalis), also called common sage or garden sage,  aromatic herb of the mint family (Lamiaceae) cultivated for its pungent leaves. Sage is native to the Mediterranean region and is used fresh or dried as a flavouring in many foods, particularly in stuffings for poultry and pork and in sausages. Some varieties are also grown as ornamentals for their attractive leaves and flowers. Several other species of the genus Salvia are also known as sage.
Sage is a perennial plant and grows about 60 cm (2 feet) tall. The oval leaves are rough or wrinkled and usually downy; the colour ranges from gray-green to whitish green, and some varieties are variegated. The flowers are borne in spikes and feature tubular two-lipped corollas that are attractive to a variety of pollinators, including bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. The flowers can be purple, pink, white, or red and produce nutlet fruits.
Sage has slightly stimulating properties; tea brewed from its leaves has been used as a tonic for centuries. In medieval Europe, sage was thought to strengthen the memory and promote wisdom. The essential oil content of sage varies up to about 2.5 percent; the principal components are thujone and borneol.
