Vriesea,   genus of epiphytes (plants that are supported by another plant and have aerial roots exposed to the humid atmosphere) of the pineapple family (Bromeliaceae), containing nearly 200 South American species. Many species are grown indoors as decorative plants.
The stiff, sword-shaped, fleshy green leaves grow in a rosette and often are mottled or banded with brown. The pink, yellow, green, or white flowers have three petals and three sepals. They grow from the centre of the rosette, often in a flat spike.
