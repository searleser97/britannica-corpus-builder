Lady’s mantle,  (genus Alchemilla),  genus of some 300 species of herbaceous perennials within the rose family (Rosaceae). A number of species are used as ornamental plants in borders and cottage gardens, and some have historically been used in herbal remedies.
Lady’s mantles are typically clump-forming plants with spreading rhizomes (underground stems). The basal leaves are covered in fine hairs, are often deeply lobed with toothed margins, and are superhydrophobic (highly water repellent). The small yellow-to-chartreuse flowers lack petals and are arranged in modest inflorescences.
One of the most common species is Alchemilla mollis, which is widely distributed in Eurasia and has been introduced to North America as an ornamental. It grows up to 60 cm (2 feet) tall on grasslands and rocky soils. The broad leaves are borne on long stalks, have shallow, rounded lobes and toothed edges, and are about 10 cm (4 inches) across. The tiny greenish yellow flowers grow in a terminal cluster.
