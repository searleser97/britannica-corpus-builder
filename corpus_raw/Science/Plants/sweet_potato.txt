Sweet potato,  (Ipomoea batatas),  food plant of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae), native to tropical America. The sweet potato is widely cultivated in tropical and warm temperate climates and is an important food crop in the southern United States, tropical America and the Caribbean, the warmer islands of the Pacific, Japan, and parts of Russia. The fleshy roots are served as a cooked vegetable, in whole or mashed form, and are used as pie filling. In Japan the crop has long been grown for drying and for manufacture of starch and alcohol.
Sweet potato stems are usually long and trailing and bear lobed or unlobed leaves that vary in shape. The flowers, borne in clusters in the axils of the leaves, are funnel-shaped and tinged with pink or rose-violet. The edible part is the much-enlarged tuberous root, varying in shape from fusiform to oblong or pointed oval. Root colours range from white to orange and occasionally purple inside and from light buff to brown or rose and purplish red outside. The pulp consists largely of starch, and orange-fleshed varieties are high in carotene. Propagated vegetatively by sprouts arising from the roots, known as slips, or by cuttings of the vines, the plant is best adapted to light friable soils such as sandy loams. At least four to five months of warm weather are required for large yields.
The sweet potato must not be confused with the common potato (Solanum tuberosum, family Solanaceae) or with the yam (various Dioscorea species, family Dioscoreaceae). Although growers in the United States often use the name “yam” to distinguish soft orange-fleshed sweet potatoes from the firm white-fleshed varieties, sweet potatoes are unrelated to true yams.
