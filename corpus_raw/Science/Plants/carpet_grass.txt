Carpet grass,  (Axonopus fissifolius),  mat-forming perennial grass of the family Poaceae, native to sandy soils in southeastern North America. Carpet grass is occasionally used as a lawn and pasture grass in warm areas, but its use generally indicates declining soil fertility, because it is a low-quality forage. The plant has naturalized in many parts of the world.
Carpet grass reaches a height of 20–50 cm (8–20 inches). Its roots are very shallow; the plant spreads vegetatively with both rhizomes and stolons. The minute wind-pollinated flowers are borne in small panicles (compound spikes) with three or four branches. They seed profusely.
Broadleaf carpet grass (A. compressus) is a closely related species native to South Africa. It too is used for lawns, though both species are often considered weeds.
