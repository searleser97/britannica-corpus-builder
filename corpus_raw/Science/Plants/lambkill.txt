Lambkill, also called Dwarf Laurel, Sheep Laurel, or Wicky,  (species Kalmia angustifolia), an open upright woody shrub of the heath family (Ericaceae). Lambkill is 0.3–1.2 m (1–4 feet) tall and has glossy, leathery, evergreen leaves and showy pink to rose flowers. It contains andromedotoxin, a poison also common to other Kalmia species (including mountain laurel and bog laurel) and other members of the heath family. In northwestern North America, where these plants occur, livestock (especially sheep) that graze on nonfertile soils of abandoned pastures and meadows may ingest sufficient lambkill to become poisoned. Symptoms include excessive salivation and nasal discharge, paralysis, and coma and may ultimately lead to death.
