Groundnut,   any of several plants that bear edible fruit or other nutlike parts. Three are members of the family Fabaceae (or Leguminosae): Arachis hypogaea, the peanut (q.v.), the fruit of which is a legume or pod rather than a true nut; Apois americana, also called wild bean and potato bean, the tubers of which are edible; and Lathyrus tuberosa, also called earth-nut pea. Cyperus esculentus, nut sedge or yellow nut grass, is a papyrus relative (family Cyperaceae) that also bears edible tubers, especially in the variety called chufa or earth almond.
