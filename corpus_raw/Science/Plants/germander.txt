Germander,  (genus Teucrium),  genus of about 260 species of plants in the mint family (Lamiaceae). Germander species are distributed nearly worldwide, and a number of them are grown as garden ornamentals.
Germanders can be herbs or subshrubs and are typically perennial. Several species feature stolons or rhizomes and can spread vegetatively. The simple aromatic leaves are arranged oppositely, and the flowers are borne in spikelike clusters. The flowers can be white, yellow, pink, red, or purple and often have one enlarged lip; they are particularly attractive to bees and produce nutlet fruits.
Wall germander (Teucrium chamaedrys) is native to Eurasia and is commonly grown as a hedge for its attractive evergreen foliage and pink-purple flowers. American germander (T. canadense) of North America has slender spikes of purple to cream flowers on stems 90 cm (3 feet) tall. Native to Europe but naturalized in North America is wood sage, or woodland germander (T. scorodonia), which bears yellow flowers. Bush germander (T. fruticans), a shrub growing to 1.5 metres (5 feet), has scattered pale blue to lilac flowers and lance-shaped leaves. It is native on hillsides of coastal Europe.
