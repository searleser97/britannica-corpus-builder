Butterfly orchid,  common name of several orchid species, especially those of the genera Psychopsis and Platanthera. Some are cultivated as ornamentals for their showy flowers.
The genus Psychopsis consists of about five species of epiphytic orchids native to South and Central America. The flowers resemble butterflies in that the two upper petals are narrow and antennae-like, the two lateral sepals are larger and look like speckled wings, and the central lip is generally solid coloured, similar to the insect’s body. The lip is typically yellow, while the remaining petals and sepals are usually red-brown, yellow, or orange. P. papilio is a common ornamental species that has a number of horticultural varieties.
Also known as rein, or bog, orchids, the genus Platanthera consists of about 100 species native to Eurasia, North Africa, and North and Central America. The white-flowered lesser butterfly orchid (Platanthera bifolia) and the greater butterfly orchid (P. chlorantha), with larger greenish white flowers, are well-known species. Both have 5–15 pleasantly scented flowers arranged on a single spike.
The Florida butterfly orchid (Encyclia tampensis) is native to Florida, Cuba, and the Bahamas and is a common epiphytic species. It bears up to 45 small fragrant flowers that are typically yellowish or green. The pink butterfly orchid (Anacamptis papilionacea) is a small Mediterranean species with attractive flowers ranging from reddish to magenta.
