Sapote,  (Pouteria sapota), also spelled zapote, also called mamey sapote, red mamey, or marmalade tree,  plant of the sapodilla family (Sapotaceae) and its edible fruit. Sapote is native to Central America but cultivated as far north as the southeastern United States. The fruit is commonly eaten fresh and is also made into smoothies, ice cream, and preserves.
The large evergreen tree grows to about 23 metres (75 feet) tall and has hard, durable, reddish wood. The small pinkish white flowers produce an edible fruit that has a rusty brown peel, is rather spherical, and measures about 5–10 cm (2–4 inches) in diameter. The reddish orange flesh is mild and musky-sweet in flavour with a creamy consistency. Each fruit contains a large, shiny brown seed.
Several other Latin American fruits are also referred to as sapotes. Black sapote (Diospyros nigra), also known as chocolate pudding fruit, is a member of the family Ebenaceae and is found throughout the Caribbean and Central America. White sapote, or casimiroa (Casimiroa edulis), ranges from Mexico to Costa Rica and is in the Rutaceae family.
