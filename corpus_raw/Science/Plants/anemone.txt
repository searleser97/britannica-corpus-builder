Anemone,  (genus Anemone), also called pasqueflower or windflower,  any of more than 100  species of perennial plants in the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). Many colourful varieties of the tuberous poppylike anemone, A. coronaria, are grown for the garden and floristâ€™s trade. Popular spring-flowering anemones, especially for naturalizing, are A. apennina, A. blanda, and A. pavonina. Other species, such as the Japanese anemone (A. hupehensis, or A. japonica), are favourite border plants for autumn flowering. Some species whose fruits bear a long plumose structure are placed in a separate section, Pulsatilla, often given the rank of genus. Anemones are distributed throughout the world but occur most commonly in woodlands and meadows of the north temperate zone. Many varieties are cultivated in gardens for their colourful flowers.
The wood anemone of Europe, A. nemorosa, which bears white flowers, causes blistering of the skin and was formerly used as an ingredient in medicines. In North America, wood anemone refers to A. quinquefolia, a delicate plant with deeply cut leaves. Windflower, the English version of the Greek-derived anemone, refers to the fact that the flowers appear to be blown open by the wind. According to a Greek myth, as Adonis died, red anemones (A. coronaria) sprang up from his blood. In remembrance of this, red anemones are often known as Adonis flowers. The term pasqueflower (from Old French pasque, Easter) refers to such floral emblems of Easter as A. patens, A. pratensis, and A. pulsatilla.
