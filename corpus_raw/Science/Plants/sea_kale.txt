Sea kale,  (Crambe maritima),  perennial plant in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Native to seashores and cliffs of Eurasia, sea kale can tolerate salty soils and is sometimes cultivated for its edible leaves and shoots. Young or blanched leaves are cooked and eaten like kale or spinach, and the shoots are often served like asparagus.
Sea kale is a hardy drought-tolerant plant and grows well in sandy well-drained soils. The waxy, blue-green, coarsely toothed leaves are 30–90 cm (1–3 feet) long. Clusters of fragrant white four-petaled flowers rise from the basal leaves in early summer. The plant requires cross-pollination and produces round corky seed pods.
