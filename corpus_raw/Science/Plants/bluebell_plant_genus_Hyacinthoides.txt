bluebell,  (genus Hyacinthoides),  genus of 11 species of bulbous perennial plants (family Asparagaceae, formerly Hyacinthaceae) native to Eurasia. The bell-shaped blue flower clusters of English bluebell, or wild hyacinth (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), and Spanish bluebell (H. hispanica) are borne on plants about 30 cm (1 foot) tall. Both species are cultivated as garden ornamentals.
Many other plants are commonly known as bluebells, including species of the genera Campanula, Eustoma, Polemonium, and Clematis. In the United States the name bluebell is usually ascribed to the unrelated Virginia bluebells (Mertensia virginica).
