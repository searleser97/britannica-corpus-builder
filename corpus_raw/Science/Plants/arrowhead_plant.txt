Arrowhead,  (genus Sagittaria),  genus of plants of the family Alismataceae, consisting of at least 28 species distributed worldwide, having leaves resembling arrowpoints. Arrowheads are perennial herbs with fleshy rhizomes (and frequently with tubers) that grow in shallow lakes, ponds, and streams. The flowers have three rounded petals and produce achene fruits. The tubers of some North American species were eaten by Native Americans and were known to early settlers as duck, or swan, potatoes. A fairly common species in North America is the broadleaf arrowhead (S. latifolia), used frequently in pond restorations to improve feeding areas for birds. The grass-leaved arrowhead (S. graminea) is found throughout eastern North America. S. sagittifolia, which grows in most of Europe, is cultivated in China for its edible tubers. A number of arrowhead species were introduced as ornamentals to Australia. They are listed as invasive species, including S. sagittifolia and S. platyphylla, and have naturalized in many streams, ponds, and agricultural waterways.
