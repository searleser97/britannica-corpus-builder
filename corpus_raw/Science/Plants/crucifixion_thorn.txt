Crucifixion thorn, also called corona de Jesus (Spanish: “crown of Jesus”),  either of two nearly leafless, very spiny shrubs or small trees of the southwestern North American deserts.
Koeberlinia spinosa, the only species of the family Koeberliniaceae, with green thorns at right angles to the branches, produces small, four-petaled, greenish flowers and clusters of black berries. Canotia holacantha, of the family Celastraceae, has ascending green thorns and rushlike green branches; it bears five-petaled flowers and oval, brown, one- or two-seeded capsules. Also called Mojave thorn, Canotia contains highly flammable resins in its stems. Both species bear scalelike leaves.
Other similar shrubs of the same area that also are called crucifixion thorn or corona de Jesus are Castela emoryi of the family Simaroubaceae and Dalea spinosa, a blue-flowered shrub of the family Fabaceae.
Among the spiny or thorny plants of Palestine are Christ’s-thorn (Paliurus spina-christi) and the jujube (Ziziphus jujuba), both of the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae).
