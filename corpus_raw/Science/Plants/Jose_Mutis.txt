José Mutis, in full José Celestino Bruno Mutis,  (born April 6, 1732, Cádiz, Spain—died September 11, 1808, Bogotá [now in Colombia]), botanist who initiated one of the most important periods of botanical exploration in Spain.
After receiving the bachelor’s degree from the University of Sevilla (Seville) in 1753, Mutis studied medicine at Madrid and in 1757 became physician to the royal household of Ferdinand VI. One of the first Spanish disciples of the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus, Mutis studied botany in his spare time until 1760, when he was appointed physician to the viceroy of New Granada in South America. In 1764, three years after arriving in Bogotá, Mutis requested financial support to establish a botanical garden but was refused because of a lack of funds. In 1766 he took up residence in the Andes at Pamplona, where he reorganized the teaching of medicine, developed modern mining methods, and investigated the curative powers of quinine. He also taught botany and botanical drawing and cultivated plants for medicinal and agricultural uses.
With the arrival of a new viceroy in 1782, Mutis was named first botanist and astronomer of the botanical expedition of northern South America. He built a botanical garden in the town of Mariquita and assembled one of the finest botanical libraries in the New World. Along with his staff of artists, zoologists, and botanists, he assembled thousands of drawings, a collection of bird and animal skins, and a herbarium containing more than 24,000 plants. He wrote hundreds of botanical papers, but his Flora de Bogotá o de Nueva Granada, containing more than 6,000 illustrations, was so massive that the Spanish government could not afford to print it.
In 1791 the botanical expedition moved to Bogotá, where, some years later, it built the first conservatory in South America.
