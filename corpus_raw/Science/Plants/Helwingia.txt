Helwingia,  genus of three species of shrubs, constituting the family Helwingiaceae in the order Aquifoliales. Native to the Himalayas and eastern Asia, all of the species in the genus have simple leaves and an unusual manner of flower growth. The plants are dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), and the flowers appear to arise directly from the leaves, the stems of the flowers being joined to the midribs of the leaves. The male flowers are clustered in a group; the female flowers are solitary or few.
