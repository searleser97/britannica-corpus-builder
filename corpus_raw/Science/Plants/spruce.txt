Spruce,  (genus Picea),  genus of about 40 species of evergreen ornamental and timber trees in the conifer family Pinaceae, native to the temperate and cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Spruce pulp is important in the paper industry, and timber from the trees is used in a variety of applications. Resonant spruce wood is used for sounding boards in pianos and the bodies of violins as well as in construction and for boats, airplanes, and barrels. Several species are cultivated as ornamentals, and some are grown as Christmas trees.
Spruces are pyramidal trees with whorled branches and thin scaly bark. Each of the linear, spirally arranged, needlelike leaves is jointed near the stem on a separate woody base. The base remains as a peglike projection on the twig when the leaf falls. The persistent-scaled cones are egg-shaped or cylindrical and characteristically hang downward once fertilized.
Black spruce (Picea mariana) and white spruce (P. glauca) are found throughout most of northern North America, from the Great Lakes to the Arctic tree line. Both are used for pulp. White spruce produces good lumber, and black spruce is the source of spruce gum. White spruce usually is 18 to 21 metres (about 60 to 70 feet) tall. A drought-tolerant cultivar, Picea glauca ‘Black Hills,’ is useful in landscaping and in windbreaks. The cones of black spruce are purple, and those of white spruce are brown.
Engelmann spruce (P. engelmannii) of western North America is an important timber source. The blue spruce, or Colorado spruce (P. pungens), has a similar range and is used as an ornamental because of its bluish leaves and symmetrical growth habit. The Norway spruce (P. abies), an important timber and ornamental tree native to northern Europe, is used in reforestation both there and in North America.
