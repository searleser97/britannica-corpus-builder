Old man cactus,  (Cephalocereus senilis),  columnar species of cactus (family Cactaceae), native to central Mexico. Because of the unkempt wisps of whitish hair along its stem, it is a popular potted plant. It grows well outdoors in Mediterranean climates.
Old man cactus usually attains 6 metres (about 20 feet) before flowering and can grow to twice that height. The flat-faced flowers are produced from a mass of long wool and bristles that cap the stem. Younger plants are almost completely covered by the white hairs, while older plants tend to be covered near the growing tips of the stems. Sharp spines are borne beneath the woolly hairs. Flowers are night-blooming and are typically pink outside and white within.
Other hairy cacti in cultivation include: yellow old man, or woolly torch (Cephalocereus palmeri); golden old man (Pilosocereus chrysacanthus); old woman (Mammillaria hahniana); Chilean old lady (Eriosyce senilis); and old man of the mountain (Cleistocactus trollii).
