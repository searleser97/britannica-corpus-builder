Timothy,  (Phleum pratense), also called herd’s-grass or meadow cat’s-tail,  perennial grass of the family Poaceae. Timothy is native to most of mainland Europe and is widely cultivated as a hay and a pasture grass in North America and the United Kingdom. The plant is named after American farmer Timothy Hanson, who promoted its use outside New England and among British farmers in the early 1700s.
The stems grow in large clumps and are 0.5 to 1 metre (1.6 to 3.3 feet) tall, with swollen bulblike bases. The leaves are typically rolled lengthwise and are about 44 cm (17 inches) long. The panicles (flower clusters) are long, dense, and cylindrical, somewhat resembling the dense heads of true cattails (genus Typha). The plant is drought resistant and can tolerate heavy and sandy soils.
Alpine, or mountain, timothy (Phleum alpinum) is about half as tall, with short, thick panicles. It occurs in wet places from Greenland to Alaska, and at high altitudes in many other parts of North America and Europe.
