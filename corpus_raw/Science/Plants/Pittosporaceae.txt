Pittosporaceae,  family of nine genera of trees, shrubs, or vinelike plants, in the order Apiales, distributed from tropical Africa to the Pacific islands. Members of the family have long, leathery, evergreen leaves; resin in stem ducts; and white, blue, yellow, or reddish flowers. Species of the genus Pittosporum are commonly known as Australian laurel. Tobira, or house-blooming mock orange (P. tobira), is a popular aromatic hedge plant in warm climates but a handsome indoor plant elsewhere. Karo (P. crassifolium) often is planted as a windbreak on seacoasts. The genera Hymenosporum, Bursaria, and Sollya also contain ornamental species.
