Velvet grass,  (Holcus lanatus), also called Yorkshire fog,  perennial grass in the family Poaceae, native to Europe and Africa. Velvet grass, so called because the entire plant has a velvety feel when touched, was introduced into Australia and North America as a forage species. It now grows as a weed in damp places such as ditches, stream banks, and drainage areas; it is considered an invasive species in some places outside its native range.
Velvet grass is a tufted grass and reaches up to 1 metre (3.3 feet) in height. The hollow stems bear flat pubescent (hairy) leaves that taper to a point. It has tufted flower clusters that may be white, green, pink, or purple. The roots are shallow and fibrous, and the plant can tolerate poor soils.
