Tracheophyte, also called vascular plant,   any of some 260,000 species of vascular plants, including all of the conspicuous flora of Earth today. The vascular system of these plants consists of xylem, concerned mainly with the conduction of water and dissolved minerals, and phloem, which functions mainly in the conduction of foods, such as sugar. Tracheophyte, meaning “tracheid plant,” refers to the water-conducting cells (called tracheids, or tracheary elements) that show spiral bands like those in the walls of the tracheae, or air tubes, of insects.
Formerly a taxonomic division or phylum, the group comprises a tremendous diversity of plants. Tracheophytes can be divided into two groups of seedless plants: the lycophytes (club mosses, spike mosses, and quillworts) and the ferns (including horsetails and whisk ferns); and two groups of seed-bearing plants: the gymnosperms (cycads, pines, spruces, firs, etc.) and the angiosperms (flowering plants). See bryophyte for plants that lack vascular systems.
Tracheophytes are believed to have originated from the green algae (Chlorophyta). The earliest fossils are from Silurian rocks more than 400,000,000 years old.
