Pothos,  (Epipremnum aureum), also called golden pothos, money plant, or devil’s ivy,  hardy indoor foliage plant of the arum family (Araceae) native to southeastern Asia. It resembles, and thus is often confused with, the common philodendron.
Pothos is an evergreen plant with thick, waxy, green, heart-shaped leaves with splashes of yellow. As a houseplant, it is commonly grown as a hanging plant. Pothos can climb by means of aerial roots, and wild or cultivated plants grown outdoors can reach enormous heights using tall trees as support. In addition, the leaves of outdoor plants grow many times larger than indoor plants. ‘Marble Queen,’ with white variegations of greater extent than in the species, and ‘Tricolor,’ with shades of green, deep yellow, and creamy white, are popular varieties. The plant is easily propagated from cuttings and rarely, if ever, flowers.
