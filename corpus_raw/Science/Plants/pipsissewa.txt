Pipsissewa,  any evergreen, herbaceous plant of the genus Chimaphila, of the heath family (Ericaceae). C. umbellata, sometimes also called prince’s pine, love-in-winter, and wintergreen, occurs in North America from Canada to Mexico and in Europe and Japan. C. maculata, sometimes called striped pipsissewa, rheumatism root, dragon’s tongue, and spotted wintergreen, occurs in North America from Canada to the southern United States. The name pipsissewa derives from a Cree Indian word referring to the diuretic properties of the leaves when eaten.
Pipsissewas are woodland plants with leathery leaves and five-petalled, fragrant, pink or white flowers that grow a few together at the end of the stems, which arise from underground rhizomes. Though difficult to cultivate, they are sometimes grown in gardens.
C. maculata grows 10–25 cm (4–10 inches) tall; the stem is more or less prostrate. The lance-shaped leaves are 2.5–7.5 cm (1–3 inches) long and have white spots along the veins. The nodding flowers are about 2.5 cm across. C. umbellata grows 12–30 cm (5–12 inches) tall. The leaves are somewhat broader than those of C. maculata and are not spotted. The flowers are about 2 cm across and appear throughout the summer.
