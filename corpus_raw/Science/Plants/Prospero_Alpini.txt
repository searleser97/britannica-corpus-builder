Prospero Alpini,  Alpini also spelled Alpino,  (born Nov. 23, 1553, Marostica, Vicenza [Italy]—died  Nov. 23, 1616, or Feb. 6, 1617, Padua), physician and botanist who is credited with the introduction to Europe of coffee and bananas. While a medical adviser to Giorgio Emo, the Venetian consul in Cairo (1580–83), Alpini made an extensive study of Egyptian and Mediterranean flora. He is reputed to have been the first to fertilize date palms artificially.
Alpini was appointed professor of botany at the University of Padua (1593), where he cultivated several species of Oriental plants described in his De plantis Aegypti liber (1592; “Book of Egyptian Plants”). Included in this work were the first European botanical accounts of coffee, banana, and a genus of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) that was later named Alpinia.
His account of current Egyptian medical practice, De medicina Aegyptorum (1591; “On Egyptian Medicine”), was a valuable addition to medical history. Alpini’s study of Egyptian diseases culminated in his widely acclaimed De praesagienda vita et morte aegrotontium (1601; The Presages of Life and Death in Diseases).
