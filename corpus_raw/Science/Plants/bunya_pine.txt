Bunya pine,  (Araucaria bidwillii), also called bunya bunya,  large evergreen conifer of the family Araucariaceae, native to humid areas in southeastern Queensland, Australia. The saplings are sold as houseplants in many areas, and the cream-coloured wood is used for veneers, plywood, and boxes. The treeâ€™s large sweet seeds were traditionally roasted and eaten by Australian Aboriginal peoples. Despite its common name, the plant is not a true pine.
The bunya pine grows to heights of 30 metres (100 feet) or more and is notable for the symmetrical structure of its branches and its immense dome-shaped leafy crown.  The bark is  thick and resinous. The female cones can weigh up to 18 kg (40 pounds) and disintegrate when mature to release the large seeds. The seeds have an unusual germination strategy in which the emerging root develops into a tuber from which the sprout later grows. Known as cryptogeal germination, it is thought that this adaptation may protect against wildfires and allows the young plants to emerge when conditions are suitable.
