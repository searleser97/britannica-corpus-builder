Impatiens,  large genus of herbaceous plants belonging to the family Balsaminaceae. Impatiens are widely distributed in Asia, Africa, and North America, and several are popular garden plants.
Impatiens bear simple leaves that are usually alternately arranged along the stem. The upper leaves are often borne in a whorl (i.e., three or more arising in a circle from the stem). The flowers, which may be purple, yellow, pink, red, or white, are irregular in shape and arise from the leaf axils; they may be solitary or in small clusters. The name, meaning “impatient,” refers to the readiness with which the plants’ seeds are dispersed. The ripe seedpod bursts upon slight pressure, thus scattering the seeds.
The garden balsam (Impatiens balsamina) is native to the tropics of Asia but has long been cultivated in temperate regions of the world. The plant is an annual that grows about 75 cm (30 inches) in height and has many horticultural forms with flowers of almost every colour except blue. Spotted jewelweed (I. capensis) and pale touch-me-not (or pale snapweed, I. pallida) are common weeds native to extensive regions of eastern North America. Spotted jewelweed grows up to 150 cm (59 inches) tall and bears orange flowers spotted with red or brown, while pale touch-me-not has larger, yellower flowers. The western touch-me-not (I. noli-tangere) is native to western North America, Europe, and Asia.
