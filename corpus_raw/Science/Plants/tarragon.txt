Tarragon,  (Artemisia dracunculus), also called estragon,  bushy aromatic herb of the family Asteraceae, the dried leaves and flowering tops of which are used to add tang and piquancy to many culinary dishes, particularly fish, chicken, stews, sauces, omelets, cheeses, vegetables, tomatoes, and pickles. Tarragon is a common ingredient in seasoning blends, such as fines herbes. The fresh leaves are used in salads, and vinegar in which fresh tarragon has been steeped is a distinctive condiment.
The plant is believed to be native to Siberia. The French variety is cultivated in Europe, particularly France and Spain, and in North America. Tarragon leaves are bright green in colour, have a warm odour, and taste reminiscent of anise. Tarragon contains 0.3 to 1.0 percent essential oil, the principal component of which is methyl chavicol.
