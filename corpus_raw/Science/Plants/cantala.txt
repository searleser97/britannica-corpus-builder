Cantala,  (Agave cantala),  plant of the family Asparagaceae and its fibre, belonging to the leaf fibre group. Likely native to Mexico, the plant has been cultivated in the Philippines since 1783 and was growing in Indonesia and India by the early 1800s. Sometimes known as Manila maguey or Cebu maguey in commercial trade, cantala fibre is made into coarse twines similar to those of the related sisal (Agave sisalana) and henequen (A. fourcroydes) plants but is softer and more pliant. It is used locally for woven fabrics and is mainly cultivated on the Indian subcontinent, in Indonesia, and in the Philippines.
Cantala is an evergreen tropical plant with lance-shaped leaves that grow directly from the stalk to form a dense rosette. The thick gray-green leaves are edged with sharp teeth and bear a terminal spine; they can reach about 2 metres (6.6 feet) in length. The plant is monocarpic, meaning that it dies after flowering, and the flowers are borne on a large stalk that can be more than 8 metres (26 feet) tall. Cantala also reproduces asexually, and clonal “pups” from the base of the rosette are used in commercial plantations.
The fibre is freed from the leaves by mechanical decortication, a scraping or peeling operation, or by a retting process common in the Philippines, employing salt water and producing fairly weak and stained fibre. The strands are white in colour and range from 75 to 150 cm (about 30 to 60 inches) in length. The fibre is fine and moisture-absorbent.
