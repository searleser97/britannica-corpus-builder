Hellebore,  member of either of two genera of poisonous herbaceous plants, Helleborus and Veratrum, some species of which are grown as garden ornamentals.
Helleborus, of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae), is composed of about 20 species of perennial herbs native to Eurasia, including black hellebore, or Christmas rose (H. niger); Lenten rose (H. orientalis); stinking hellebore, or bear’s foot (H. foetidus); and green hellebore (H. viridis). Typically, the plants are nearly stemless, with thick roots and long-stalked, divided leaves. The showy flowers, with five petal-like sepals, are borne above the foliage.
The genus Veratrum, of the family Melanthiaceae, is composed of about 25–30 species, which are native widely in damp areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The genus includes European white hellebore (V. album), once used as an arrow poison, and American white hellebore (V. viride), also called itchweed. The plants have simple, parallel-veined leaves and terminal clusters of small flowers.
