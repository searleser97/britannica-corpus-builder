Meconopsis,  genus of about 45 species of herbaceous plants of the poppy family (Papaveraceae), mostly native to south-central Asia. Several species are grown as highly prized ornamentals for their attractive flowers. The genus is best known for its striking blue poppies, especially the Himalayan blue poppy (Meconopsis baileyi), the Tibetan poppy (M. grandis), and the hybrid M. ‘Lingholm.’ The only European representative is the yellow-flowered Welsh poppy (M. cambrica).
