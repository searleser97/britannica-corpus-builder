Goldenrod,  any of about 150 species of weedy, usually perennial herbs that constitute the genus Solidago of the family Asteraceae. Most of them are native to North America, though a few species grow in Europe and Asia. They have toothed leaves that usually alternate along the stem and yellow flower heads composed of both disk and ray flowers. The many small heads may be crowded together in one-sided clusters, or groups of heads may be borne on short branches to form a cluster at the top of the stem.
Some species are clump plants with many stems; others have only one stem and few branches. Canadian goldenrod (S. canadensis) has hairy, toothed, lance-shaped leaves and hairy stems; it is sometimes cultivated as a garden ornamental. Solidago virgaurea of Europe, also grown as a garden plant, is the source of a yellow dye and was once used in medicines.
The goldenrods are characteristic plants in eastern North America, where about 60 species occur. They are found almost everywhere—in woodlands, swamps, on mountains, in fields, and along roadsides—and form one of the chief floral glories of autumn from the Great Plains eastward to the Atlantic.
