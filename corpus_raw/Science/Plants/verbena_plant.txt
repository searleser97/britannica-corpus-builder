Verbena,  any of several flowering plants of the genera Verbena and Glandularia in the family Verbenaceae, the majority of which are native to the tropical and subtropical Americas. Most are perennials, though a few are annuals. They usually have opposite leaves that are toothed, lobed, or dissected. The flowers are small to medium-sized and frequently borne on spikes.
While verbena species were all formerly circumscribed by the genus Verbena, a taxonomic revision has led to the placement of some species into the related genus Glandularia. The common garden verbena (Glandularia Ã— hybrida, formerly Verbena hybrida) is a square-stemmed creeping plant that bears flat heads of phloxlike flowers in a range of colours. Clump verbena, or rose verbena (Glandularia canadensis, formerly V. canadensis), is also sometimes cultivated for garden flowers.
Most of the true Verbena species in North America are low-growing, small-flowered, and somewhat weedy plants that are frequently referred to as vervains. The blue vervain (V. hastata) reaches a height of 1.5 metres (5 feet) and produces spikes of blue to purple flowers. The Eurasian species V. officinalis, the herb of the cross, was once considered a medicinal plant.
