Mountain mahogany,  (genus Cercocarpus),  genus of five or six species of North American shrubs or small trees in the rose family (Rosaceae). The hard heartwood of these trees is highly valued for carving, and it is said that the common name was given by the Mormons, who used the wood to build the Tabernacle organ at Salt Lake City, Utah. The species are unrelated to the tropical mahogany trees of the family Meliaceae.
Mountain mahogany plants are usually evergreen and bear small alternate leaves with smooth or toothed margins. The small, bisexual, trumpetlike flowers lack petals and can be clustered or solitary. They are wind-pollinated and produce cylindrical achene fruits characterized by a 3–10 cm (1–4 inch) feathery plume that facilitates wind dispersal. Many species are important members of the chaparral communities of the western United States and northern Mexico and are especially common in the coastal and interior mountains of those areas.
The birch-leaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus betuloides) and curl-leaf mountain mahogany (C. ledifolius) are both scaly-barked trees that may reach up to 9 metres (30 feet) in height. The true, or alder-leaf, mountain mahogany (C. montanus) is a long-lived shrub common to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and is often heavily browsed by elk and deer.  One species, the rare Catalina mahogany (C. traskiae), consists of only a single population found on Santa Catalina Island off the coast of southern California.
