Sweetbrier, also called Eglantine,   (Rosa eglanteria, or R. rubiginosa), small, prickly wild rose with fragrant foliage and numerous small pink flowers. Native to Europe and western Asia, it is widely naturalized in North America, where it grows along roadsides and in pastures from Nova Scotia and Ontario southwestward to Tennessee and Kansas.
Sweetbrier can reach a height of about 2 metres (6 feet) and is useful as a screening shrub; a cultivated form, ‘Duplex,’ has double pink flowers. While not especially ornamental, it has been crossed with Austrian briar (R. foetida), to produce the Penzance hybrids with pinkish flowers with yellow centres.
Eglantine is frequently alluded to in the writings of English poets, from Chaucer onward. John Milton, in L’Allegro, used the term “twisted eglantine” to denote, it is thought, the woodbine honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum), which is still called eglantine in northeastern Yorkshire.
