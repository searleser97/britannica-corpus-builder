Ginseng,  (genus Panax), Chinese (Wade-Giles romanization) jen sheng or (Pinyin) ren sheng (“root of heaven”),  genus of 12 species of medicinal herbs of the family Araliaceae. The root of Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng), native to Manchuria and Korea, has long been used as a drug and is made into a stimulating tea in China, Korea, and Japan. American ginseng (P. quinquefolius), native from Quebec and Manitoba southward to the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, is also used in traditional medicine. The majority of the cultivated roots of American ginseng are dried and exported to Hong Kong, and from there the spice is distributed to Southeast Asia.
Ginseng plants are perennial herbs with sturdy taproots. The plants generally die back in the fall and reemerge from the root system in the spring. The leaves are palmately compound with 3–5 leaflets, the margins of which may be entire, toothed, or lobed, depending on the species. The inflorescence is a solitary umbel (a flat-topped cluster of flowers) with both bisexual and male flowers. The fruit is a drupe. Cultivated ginseng plants usually require 5–7 years to mature from seed.
Ginseng has a sweetly aromatic flavour. Its root has long been regarded by the Chinese as a panacea for illness, though it was usually used by them in a prophylactic (preventive) rather than a curative manner. Pharmacologically, ginseng is nonspecific in its effects and is capable of a normalizing action irrespective of the pathological situation. Ginseng’s effects include improved mental performance, learning, and memory and sensory awareness. The basis of ginseng’s action is believed to be due to certain chemical agents in it that increase the brain’s adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) activity without involving the adrenal glands. A generalized mental arousal is thereby effected.
