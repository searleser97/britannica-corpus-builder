Monkshood,  (genus Aconitum), also called wolfsbane or aconite,  genus of more than 200 species of showy perennial herbs of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). They occur in the north temperate zone, usually in partial shade and in rich soil. Some species are cultivated as ornamental plants, and several are used in traditional medicine, although all species are considered extremely poisonous.
The roots are thick or tuberous, and some species produce rhizomes. The leaves usually have fingerlike lobes; each lobe is itself trilobed and toothed. The hood-shaped flowers, borne mostly in spikelike clusters, are usually purple or blue, sometimes yellow or white. There are five sepals and two to five petals. The fruit is an aggregate of follicles.
A few species are cultivated in gardens, including ‘Sparks variety’ monkshood (Aconitum henryi), Carmichael’s monkshood (A. carmichaelii), and southern blue monkshood (A. uncinatum). All species contain the powerful poison aconitine. The common monkshood, or friar’s cap (A. napellus), native to mountain slopes in Europe and east to the Himalayas, has been the most important source of this drug, which in ancient times was administered to criminals and has been used in minute amounts for reducing fever or treating neuralgia and for other medicinal purposes.
