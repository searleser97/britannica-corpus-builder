squirting cucumber,  (Ecballium elaterium),  trailing herbaceous plant in the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae). The plant is native to the Mediterranean region but has been introduced to other areas as a garden curiosity for its distinctive explosive fruits. Squirting cucumber contains poisonous cucurbitacins, and all parts of the plant can be fatal if ingested.
The hairy, rough, thick-stemmed plant may spread out to about 60 cm (about 24 inches) and has yellow bell-shaped flowers. The long-stalked bluish green fruits are about 4–5 cm (1.6–2 inches) long. Upon reaching maturity, the fruits explosively eject their brown seeds as they detach from the stem; the seeds may travel 3 to 6 metres (about 10 to 20 feet) from the plant.
