Calopogon, also called grass pink,  genus of five species of terrestrial orchids (family Orchidaceae), native to North America and the West Indies. The plants are commonly found in bogs and swamps, though some grow in prairie habitats. They are occasionally cultivated as ornamentals.
Members of the genus are perennials and feature one or two ribbed leaves per corm (swollen stem base) and several flowers on each flower spike. Unlike most other orchids, the flowers of most Calopogon species bear the labellum (lip) at the top of the flower; the labellum is characteristically covered in hairs. The flowers range in colour from lavender and deep pink to white and are about 2.5 cm (1 inch) wide.
