Ackee,  (Blighia sapida), also spelled akee,  tree of the soapberry family (Sapindaceae) native to West Africa, widely cultivated throughout tropical and subtropical regions for its edible fruit. Ackee and salt fish is a popular dish in the Caribbean and is the national dish of Jamaica. Taken to the Caribbean area with slaves from Africa, the ackee tree was introduced to science by William Bligh (hence its botanical name), famous as captain of the ill-fated Bounty.
The evergreen tree grows about 9 metres (30 feet) tall and bears pinnately compound leaves (leaflets form rows on either side of a common axis) and fragrant white flowers. At maturity, the reddish woody shell of the fist-sized fruits splits open to reveal three white arils (fleshy seed coverings), each with a large shiny black seed. The soft, bland arils are eaten as a vegetable, though it is toxic, even fatal, if eaten unripe.
