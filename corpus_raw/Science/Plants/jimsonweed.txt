jimsonweed,  (Datura stramonium), also called thorn apple or devilâ€™s snare,  annual herbaceous plant of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Possibly native to Central America, the plant is considered an invasive species throughout much of the Northern Hemisphere. It was used by Algonquin Indians in eastern North America, among other indigenous peoples of the Americas, as a hallucinogen and intoxicant. The leaves contain potent alkaloids (notably hyoscyamine and hyoscine), and all parts of the plant are poisonous if ingested.
Jimsonweed grows to a height of 1 to almost 2 metres (up to 6.5 feet) and is commonly found along roadsides or other disturbed habitats. The plant has large white or violet trumpet-shaped flowers and produces a large spiny capsule fruit to which the common name thorn apple is sometimes applied. The stems are green, sometimes tinged with purple, and bear simple alternate leaves with toothed to lobed margins.
