Caper,  (genus Capparis),  genus of some 250 species of low prickly trees, shrubs, or lianas (family Capparaceae). Several species are cultivated for their edible parts. The European caperbush (Capparis spinosa) is known for its flower buds, which are pickled in vinegar and used as a pungent condiment; the term caper also refers to one of the pickled flower buds. The buds and fruits of karira (C. decidua) are eaten as vegetables, and curries are prepared from seeds and fruits of C. zeylandica.
