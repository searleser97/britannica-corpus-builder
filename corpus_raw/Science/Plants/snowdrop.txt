snowdrop,  (genus Galanthus),  genus of about 20 species of white-flowered Eurasian plants in the amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae). Several species, including common snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) and giant snowdrop (G. elwesii), are cultivated as ornamentals for their nodding, sometimes fragrant flowers. They are commonly the earliest garden flowers to blossom in the late winter or early spring, sometimes emerging when snow is still on the ground.
Snowdrops are small perennial herbs with bulbs and basal linear leaves. The small flowers are composed of six white tepals (undifferentiated petals and sepals); the three outer tepals are long and curved, and the inner tepals are small and notched. The fruit is a capsule and bears seeds with characteristic hook-shaped elaiosomes (fatty seed structures) that attract ants for dispersal. The plant dies back shortly after the fruits have opened.
