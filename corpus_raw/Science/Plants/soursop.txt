Soursop,  (Annona muricata), also called guanabana, graviola, or Brazilian pawpaw,  tree of the custard apple family (Annonaceae), grown for its large edible fruits. Native to the American tropics, the tree has been widely introduced in the Old World tropics. The fruitâ€™s fibrous white flesh, which combines the flavours of mango and pineapple, can be eaten fresh and is strained to make custards, ice creams, and drinks. Soursop has been promoted as an alternative cancer treatment, but clinical studies in humans are lacking.  See also custard apple.
Reaching about 8 metres (26 feet), the soursop tree has broad-ended oval evergreen leaves about 12 cm (5 inches) long. The aromatic fruits are oval, spiny, and green-skinned; they grow about 20 cm (8 inches) long and weigh up to 4.5 kg (10 pounds). The plant is usually cultivated from seed and grows well in warm climates with high humidity.
