Calanthe,  genus of about 200 species of terrestrial orchids (family Orchidaceae). The plants are mostly native to tropical and subtropical areas of Asia and South Africa, with a few Australian, Central American, and West Indian species. Several are listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
Many species of Calanthe lack pseudobulbs (bulblike stems); those that do occur are large and usually are accompanied by large leaves. A number of species are drought deciduous and lose their leaves during the dry season. Numerous flowers are borne on each flower spike, which may be erect or slightly arched. The seeds are typically fine and dustlike.
