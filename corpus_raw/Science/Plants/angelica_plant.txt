Angelica,  large genus of aromatic herbs of the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae). The roots and fruit of the Eurasian species, Angelica archangelica (see photograph), yield angelica oil used to flavour liqueurs and in perfumery, while the tender shoots are used in making certain kinds of aromatic sweetmeats; tea made from the roots and leaves is a traditional medicine for respiratory ailments. In the Faroe Islands and in Iceland, where the plant grows abundantly, it is considered a vegetable. The British species, A. sylvestris, is a tall perennial herb with large bipinnate leaves and large compound umbels of white or purple flowers. The common name alexanders is applied to A. atropurpurea in the United States.
