bog rosemary,  (Andromeda polifolia), also called moorwort,  low evergreen shrub of the heath family (Ericaceae). The plant is native to bogs in northeastern North America, northern and central Europe, and northern Asia. Several ornamental cultivars have been developed, though the plant requires cool moist conditions and acidic soil to flourish.
Bog rosemary grows 30 to 60 cm (1 to 2 feet) tall and has a creeping rootstock. The narrow green leaves are about 3 cm (1.2 inches) long and resemble those of true rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), which is unrelated. The small pinkish white flowers are urn-shaped and grow in small terminal clusters. All parts of the plant contain andromedotoxin and are considered poisonous.
