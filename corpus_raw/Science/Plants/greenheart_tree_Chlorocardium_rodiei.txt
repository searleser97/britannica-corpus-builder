Greenheart,  (Chlorocardium rodiei), also called bebeeru,  valuable South American timber tree of the laurel family (Lauraceae). A large tree, it grows to a height of 40 metres (130 feet) and is native to the Guianas. The bark and fruits contain bebeerine, an alkaloid formerly used to reduce fever.
Greenheart wood, which is both strong and dense, is used chiefly in Europe for underwater applications, such as pilings for wharves and bridges and in ships. Its excessive weight makes it largely unfit for other purposes. Greenheart wood is dark green.
