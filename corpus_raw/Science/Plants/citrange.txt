Citrange,  hybrid tree and its fruit produced by crossing any variety of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) with the hardy trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata); such hybrids are generally much hardier than sweet oranges. About a dozen varieties of citrange have been named; all produce fruit that is highly acid, juicy, and of value mainly for flavouring drinks or for culinary use. They are too acid and bitter for eating out of hand. Because they are hardier than oranges, lemons, or limes, they are of interest in areas too cold for raising those fruits.
Some varieties of citrange are used for rootstocks for other kinds of citrus fruits. They are generally vigorous and disease-resistant as well as hardy. As rootstocks, they tend to dwarf slightly the grapefruit, orange, or lemon tops worked on them.
