Agrimony,  (genus Agrimonia),  genus of some 12â€“15 species of perennial herbs in the rose family (Rosaceae). Agrimony species are found primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and have historically been used in folk medicine.
Agrimony plants are typically erect and bear toothed alternate leaves. The yellow flowers have five petals and feature characteristic hooked spines below the sepals. The fruit is a burlike achene.
Common agrimony, also known as church steeples (Agrimonia eupatoria), is a herbaceous hardy perennial that is native to Europe and North Africa but is widespread in other northern temperate regions. Inhabiting hedge banks and the borders of fields, the plant grows to about 120 cm (4 feet) tall and has alternate compound leaves that yield a yellow dye. The small, stalkless yellow flowers are borne in a long terminal spike. The fruit is about 0.6 cm (0.2 inch) in diameter and bears a number of hooks that enable it to cling easily to clothing or the coat of an animal. Tall hairy agrimony (A. gryposepala) is a similar species that is widespread in the United States.
