Virginia creeper,  (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), also called woodbine or American ivy,  woody vine in the grape family (Vitaceae). It is commonly found in eastern North America and is often grown as a covering vine for walls, fences, and trunks of large trees. Several cultivated varieties, with smaller leaves and shorter tendrils, have been developed to provide denser coverage. The plant is sometimes confused with poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), which is unrelated to Virginia creeper.
A deciduous plant, Virginia creeper bears palmately compound leaves with five toothed leaflets; its fall colour ranges from yellow to red-purple. It climbs by means of characteristic disk-tipped tendrils. The small greenish flowers are borne in inconspicuous clusters. The fruit is a purple to black berry and is attractive to birds.
