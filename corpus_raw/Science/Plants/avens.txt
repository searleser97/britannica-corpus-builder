Avens,  (genus Geum),  genus of about 50 species of perennial flowering plants in the rose family (Rosaceae). Most of the species occur in the north or south temperate zone or in the Arctic, and several are cultivated for their white, red, orange, or yellow flowers. Avens rarely grow more than 60 cm (2 feet) tall. They have basal leaves that are compound or deeply lobed. The five-petaled flowers, commonly 2â€“3 cm (about 1 inch) in diameter, are solitary or form small clusters.
The mountain avens (genus Dryas) are closely related and consist of some three species of evergreen shrubs. The flowers of those species have eight petals instead of the typical five that are common in the family.
