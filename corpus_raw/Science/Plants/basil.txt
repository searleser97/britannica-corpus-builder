Basil,  (Ocimum basilicum), also called sweet basil,  annual herb of the mint family (Lamiaceae), grown for its aromatic leaves. Basil is likely native to India and is widely grown as a kitchen herb. The leaves are used fresh or dried to flavour meats, fish, salads, and sauces; basil tea is a stimulant.
Basil leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, with smooth or slightly toothed edges that typically cup slightly; the leaves are arranged oppositely along the square stems. The small flowers are borne in terminal clusters and range in colour from white to magenta. The plant is extremely frost-sensitive and grows best in warm climates. Basil is susceptible to Fusarium wilt, blight, and downy mildew, especially when grown in humid conditions.
A number of varieties are used in commerce, including the small-leaf common basil, the larger leaf Italian basil, and the large lettuce-leaf basil. Thai basil (O. basilicum var. thyrsiflora) and the related holy basil (O. tenuiflorum) and lemon basil (O. Ã—citriodorum) are common in Asian cuisine. The dried large-leaf varieties have a fragrant aroma faintly reminiscent of anise and a warm, sweet, aromatic, mildly pungent flavour. The dried leaves of the common basil are less fragrant and more pungent in flavour.
The essential oil content is 0.1 percent, the principal components of which are methyl chavicol and d-linalool.
