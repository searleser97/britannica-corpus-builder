Creeping bent,  (Agrostis stolonifera), also called creeping bentgrass or carpet bentgrass,  perennial grass of the family Poaceae, widely used as a lawn and turf grass. Creeping bent is native to Eurasia and northern Africa and commonly grows in wetlands. The plant is widely naturalized in many places throughout the world and is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range. The grass is sometimes grown as forage for livestock and is one of the most common species used for golf putting greens. See bentgrass.
Creeping bent often forms mats or tufts and spreads vegetatively by stolons. The stems grow up to 1 metre (3 feet) in length and bear long tapering leaf blades, usually blue-gray in colour. The ligule, which forms where the leaf joins the stem, is characteristically pointed. The plant flowers in late summer and bears red wind-pollinated spikelets in clusters.
