Grape hyacinth,  (genus Muscari),  genus of about 50 species of small bulbous perennials (family Asparagaceae, formerly Hyacinthaceae) native to the Mediterranean region. Grape hyacinths often are planted as spring-flowering garden ornamentals. Some cultivated species readily naturalize and can become weedy.
Most species of the genus have dense clusters of blue, white, yellow, or pink urn-shaped flowers that are borne at the tip of a leafless flower stalk. The flowers of some species have a musky odour. The leaves are long and narrow and emerge from an underground bulb. The fruit is a capsule.
