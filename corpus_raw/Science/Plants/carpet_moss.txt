Carpet moss,  (genus Hypnum),  genus of about 80 species of mosses (family Hypnaceae) that form dense green mats in many habitats throughout the world, especially on decaying wood in moist areas. A few species are aquatic. About 20 species occur in North America, though the taxonomy of the group is contentious. Carpet moss has been used to stuff bedding; it was once believed to induce sleep.
The male and female reproductive organs of some species of carpet mosses are borne on separate plants, and the cylindrical curved capsules (spore cases) have beaked lids. The phyllids (leaves) of Hypnum cupressiforme, common in Europe and rare but widely distributed in North America, are curved. Sheet moss, used by florists, is usually a golden-green species, H. curvifolium. The feather moss, or plume moss, formerly H. crista-castrensis, is now considered to be a member of the genus Ptilium.
