Droseraceae,  sundew plant family, consisting of three genera and some 155 species of carnivorous plants in the order Caryophyllales. With the exception of the aquatic genus Aldrovanda, the members of Droseraceae typically grow in bogs and fens with poor soil conditions. The largest genus, Drosera, contains about 152 species of annuals and perennials known as sundews and widely distributed in tropical and temperate regions. The leaves of those plants are usually arranged in a basal rosette, and the upper leaf surfaces are covered with sticky, gland-tipped trichomes (plant hairs) that entrap and digest insects and other small prey. Those leaves are often curled in bud.
Endemic to a small region of the eastern United States, the genus Dionaea consists of only the iconic Venus flytrap (D. muscipula). Commonly sold as a novelty plant, the Venus flytrap features modified leaves that snap shut to entrap and digest flies and other prey.
The waterwheel plant (Aldrovanda vesiculosa) is the only member of its genus. Once widely distributed throughout much of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, the waterwheel plant is listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. A free-floating aquatic species, the waterwheel plant features tiny carnivorous traps that are rapidly activated to ensnare a variety of small prey, particularly mosquito larvae.
