Hop-hornbeam,  (genus Ostrya),  genus of about seven species of deciduous ornamental trees of the birch family (Betulaceae) native to Eurasia and North America. They are closely related to hornbeams of the genus Carpinus. Their common name derives from their fruit clusters that resemble hops.
Hop-hornbeam trees have shaggy scaling bark. The thin translucent green leaves have hairy leafstalks and are borne alternately along the stems. Male and female flowers are borne on the same plant. The male flowers are borne in long pendulous catkins and the female in shorter pendulous or erect catkins. The green fruit clusters are composed of many bladderlike scales, each bearing a small flat nut.
The European hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and the Japanese hop-hornbeam (O. japonica) may reach 21 metres (70 feet); the other species are much smaller. The eastern, or American, hop-hornbeam (O. virginiana) is known as ironwood for its hard heavy wood, used locally for fence posts and small articles such as tool handles.
