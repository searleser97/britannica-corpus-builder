Jícama,  (Pachyrhizus erosus), also called yam bean,  leguminous vine of the pea family (Fabaceae), grown for its edible tubers. Jícama is native to Mexico and Central and South America and is an important local food crop. Some varieties (known as jícama de aqua in Spanish) have clear juices, and some (jícama de leche) have milky juice. Both types of tubers are mild-flavoured and usually are eaten raw in salads or sprinkled with lime juice and powdered chili peppers as a snack. Jícama can also be cooked. Although the very young seedpods of the plant are sometimes eaten, the mature seeds, leaves, and stems contain rotenone, a chemical used as an insecticide, and are highly toxic.
Jícama is a perennial vine but is typically grown as an annual, since the plant is killed during the harvest. If left to grow, the plant can reach 5 metres (16 feet) in height. The compound leaves are deep green and feature three leaflets. The flowers are blue or white and produce legume fruits, though they are usually removed to promote tuber growth. The plant’s irregularly globular brown-skinned tubers are white-fleshed, crisp, and juicy.
