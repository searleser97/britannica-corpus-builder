Strychnos,  genus of 190 species of tropical woody plants, many of them trees, in the family Loganiaceae. The flowers are small and usually white or creamy white in colour. Several are important sources of drugs or poisons: strychnine, from the seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica and other species; and curare, from the bark of S. toxifera and other species. A few species are valued locally for their sweet fruits, including Natal orange (S. spinosa) and S. unguacha.
The extinct species S. electri, identified from flowers trapped in amber and dated to the mid-Tertiary Period (between 15 million and 30 million years ago), represents the oldest known asterid (flowering plant lineage); its discovery in 2016 provided significant insight into the evolution and geographical distribution of angiosperms.
