bramble,  (genus Rubus),  large genus of flowering plants in the rose family (Rosaceae), consisting of usually prickly shrubs. Brambles occur naturally throughout the world, especially in temperate areas, and a number are invasive species outside their native range. Many are widely cultivated for their fruits, including raspberries, blackberries, and hybrids such as loganberries and boysenberries.
Brambles are typically erect or trailing shrubs with canelike stems, though some species are herbaceous. Many spread vegetatively and are frequently armed with prickles or hairs along their branches. The leaves can be simple or compound and are often toothed or lobed; a number of species are deciduous. The five-petaled flowers are usually white or pink and produce a characteristic fruit known as an aggregate of druplets. Many species freely hybridize with each other, making classification extremely difficult.
