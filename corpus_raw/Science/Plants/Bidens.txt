Bidens, also called beggar-ticks,  cosmopolitan genus of weedy herbs in the family Asteraceae, consisting of about 230 species. Bidens plants are variously known as bur marigold, sticktights, and tickseed sunflowers. They are characterized by fruits with two to four barbed bristles that become attached to animal coats or to human clothing. Some have divided leaves with toothed segments and long ray flowers; others have undivided lance-shaped leaves and short ray flowers or none at all. Most have yellow disk flowers, and at least one species, B. ferulaefolia, is cultivated as a garden ornamental.
