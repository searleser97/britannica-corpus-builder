Alexandrian laurel,  (Calophyllum inophyllum), also called beauty leaf, beach calophyllum, or dilo oil tree,  evergreen plant (family Calophyllaceae) cultivated as an ornamental throughout tropical areas. Alexandrian laurel ranges from East Africa to Australia and is often cultivated near the ocean; it is resistant to salt spray and has a leaning habit. Dilo, a strongly scented medicinal oil, is extracted from the seeds, and the wood is used in building canoes.
The multibranched, often gracefully crooked tree reaches 16–19 metres (50–60 feet). Its handsome leathery, glossy leaves are oval-shaped with smooth margins. It produces upright sprays of fragrant white flowers with yellow centres of numerous stamens. The round fruit, sometimes known as a ballnut, is a drupe.
