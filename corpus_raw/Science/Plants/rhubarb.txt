rhubarb,  (Rheum rhabarbarum), also called pieplant,  a hardy perennial of the smartweed family (Polygonaceae) native to Asia and grown for its large edible petioles (leafstalks). Rhubarb is commonly grown in cool areas of the temperate zones. The plantâ€™s fleshy, tart, and highly acidic leafstalks are used in pies, often with strawberries, in compotes and preserves, and sometimes as the base of a wine or an aperitif. The leaves contain toxins, including oxalic acid, and are not eaten.
Rhubarb produces large clumps of enormous leaves, up to 60 cm (2 feet) across. The leaves are borne on proportionately large petioles, which are 25 mm (1 inch) or more in diameter and up to 60 cm in length and arise from an underground stem. The leaves appear early in the spring. Later in the season a large central flower stalk may appear and bear numerous small greenish white flowers and angular winged fruits containing one seed. The roots withstand cold well, although the tops die back in autumn.
The roots of two species known as Chinese rhubarb (Rheum officinale and R. palmatum) have been used medicinally in China and Tibet since ancient times, primarily as a cathartic. Their purgative properties and yellow colour are derived from anthracene glycosides; they also contain high levels of calcium oxalate, which give a characteristic grittiness.
