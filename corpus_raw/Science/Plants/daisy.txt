daisy,  any of several species of flowering plants belonging to the aster family (Asteraceae). The name daisy commonly denotes the oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), the Shasta daisy (L. Ã—superbum), and the English, or true, daisy (Bellis perennis). These and other plants called daisies are distinguished by a composite flower head composed of 15 to 30 white ray flowers surrounding a centre consisting of bright yellow disk flowers, though other colour combinations are common.
The oxeye daisy is native to Europe and Asia but has become a common wild plant in the United States and elsewhere. This perennial grows to a height of about 60 cm (2 feet) and has oblong incised leaves and long petioles (leafstalks). Its solitary flower heads are about 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) in diameter, and the ray flowers are white in colour. The cultivated Shasta daisy resembles the oxeye daisy but has larger flower heads that may reach a diameter of 10 cm (4 inches).
Members of the genus Bellis are perennials that have solitary flower heads borne on long stalks; the disk flowers are yellow, the ray flowers white or purple. The English daisy (B. perennis) is often used as a bedding plant. It has numerous spoon-shaped, slightly hairy leaves near its base that form a rosette. The plant has leafless flower stalks and hairy bracts (leaflike structures) below the flower heads. Some varieties of the English daisy have double flowers; others may have pink or red ray flowers surrounding the bright yellow disk. Like the oxeye, the English daisy is native to Europe but has become a common wild plant in much of North America.
Other daisies include the Gerbera daisy (Gerbera jamesonii) of the floral industry, marguerite daisy (Argyranthemum frutescens), painted lady daisy (Tanacetum coccineum), and pyrethrum daisy (Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium) and various members of the genera Chrysanthemum and Erigeron.
