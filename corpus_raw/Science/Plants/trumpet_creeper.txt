trumpet creeper,   either of two species of ornamental vines of the genus Campsis (family Bignoniaceae, q.v.). Both are deciduous shrubs that climb by aerial rootlets.
Campsis radicans, also called trumpet vine and cow itch, is a hardy climber native in eastern and southern United States; it produces terminal clusters of tubular, trumpet-shaped orange to orange-scarlet flowers (see photograph). The Chinese trumpet creeper (C. grandiflora) of eastern Asia is a poor climber but produces spectacular bunches of brilliant scarlet flowers.
