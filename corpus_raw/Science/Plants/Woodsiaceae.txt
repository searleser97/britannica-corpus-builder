Woodsiaceae,  the cliff fern family, containing 15 genera and about 700 species, in the division Pteridophyta. Members of Woodsiaceae are distributed nearly worldwide, but species are most diverse in temperate regions and in mountainous tropical areas. Most species are terrestrial in forested habitats or grow on rocks and cliffs. Leaf morphology, as well as sorus and indusium shapes, is extremely variable. Several of the larger genera contain species that are cultivated in shade gardens or rock gardens, including Athyrium (lady fern), Cystopteris (fragile fern), Deparia (silvery spleenwort), Diplazium (twinsorus fern), Gymnocarpium (oak fern), and Woodsia (cliff fern). Diplazium esculentum, an Old World species known as vegetable fern, is commonly steamed and served as a vegetable in East Asia.
