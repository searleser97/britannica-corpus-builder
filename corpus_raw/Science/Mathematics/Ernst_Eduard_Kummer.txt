Ernst Eduard Kummer,  (born January 29, 1810, Sorau, Brandenburg, Prussia [Germany]—died May 14, 1893, Berlin), German mathematician whose introduction of ideal numbers, which are defined as a special subgroup of a ring, extended the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (unique factorization of every integer into a product of primes) to complex number fields.
After teaching in Gymnasium 1 year at Sorau and 10 years at Liegnitz, Kummer became professor of mathematics at the University of Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) in 1842. In 1855 he succeeded Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet as professor of mathematics at the University of Berlin, at the same time also becoming a professor at the Berlin War College.
In 1843 Kummer showed Dirichlet an attempted proof of Fermat’s last theorem, which states that the formula xn + yn = zn, where n is an integer greater than 2, has no solution for positive integral values of x, y, and z. Dirichlet found an error, and Kummer continued his search and developed the concept of ideal numbers. Using this concept, he proved the insolubility of the Fermat relation for all but a small group of primes, and he thus laid the foundation for an eventual complete proof of Fermat’s last theorem. For his great advance, the French Academy of Sciences awarded him its Grand Prize in 1857. The ideal numbers have made possible new developments in the arithmetic of algebraic numbers.
Inspired by the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on systems of optical rays, Kummer developed the surface (residing in four-dimensional space) now named in his honour. Kummer also extended the work of Carl Friedrich Gauss on the hypergeometric series, adding developments that are useful in the theory of differential equations.
