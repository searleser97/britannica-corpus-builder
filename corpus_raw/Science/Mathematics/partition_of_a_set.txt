Partition,   in mathematics and logic, division of a set of objects into a family of subsets that are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive; that is, no element of the original set is present in more than one of the subsets, and all the subsets together contain all the members of the original set.
A related concept, central to the mathematical topics of combinatorics and number theory, is the partition of a positive integerâ€”that is, the number of ways that an integer n can be expressed as the sum of k smaller integers. For example, the number of ways of representing the number 7 as the sum of 3 smaller whole numbers (n = 7, k = 3) is 4 (5 + 1 + 1, 4 + 2 + 1, 3 + 3 + 1, and 3 + 2 + 2).
