Vaughan Jones, in full Vaughan Frederick Randal Jones,  (born December 31, 1952, Gisborne, New Zealand—died September 6, 2020, Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.), New Zealand mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1990 for his study of functional analysis and knot theory.
Jones attended the University of Geneva’s school of mathematics (Ph.D., 1979) and became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, U.S., in 1985. He was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyōto, Japan, in 1990.
In his study of von Neumann algebras (algebras of bounded operators acting on a Hilbert space), Jones came across polynomials that were invariant for knots and links—simple closed curves in three-dimensional space. Initially it was suspected that these were essentially Alexander polynomials (named after the work of the American mathematician James W. Alexander in 1928), but this turned out not to be the case. For any topological displacement (without cutting the loop), the associated Alexander polynomial is unchanged, or invariant. Both Alexander’s polynomials and the new polynomials are specializations of the more general two-variable Jones polynomials. The Jones polynomials do have an advantage over the earlier Alexander polynomials in that they distinguish knots from their mirror images. Further, while these polynomials are useful in knot theory, they are also of interest in the study of statistical mechanics, Dynkin diagrams in the representation theory of simple Lie algebras, and quantum groups. (For further information, see mathematics, history of: Mathematical physics and the theory of groups.)
Jones’s publications included Actions of Finite Groups on the Hyperfinite Type II 1 Factor (1980); with Frederick M. Goodman and Pierre de la Harpe, Coxeter Graphs and Towers of Algebras (1989); and Subfactors and Knots (1991).
