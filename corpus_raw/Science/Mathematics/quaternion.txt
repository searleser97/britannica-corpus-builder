Quaternion,  in algebra, a generalization of two-dimensional complex numbers to three dimensions. Quaternions and rules for operations on them were invented by Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton in 1843. He devised them as a way of describing three-dimensional problems in mechanics. Following a long struggle to devise mathematical operations that would retain the normal properties of algebra, Hamilton hit upon the idea of adding a fourth dimension. This allowed him to retain the normal rules of algebra except for the commutative law for multiplication (in general, ab ≠ ba), so that the quaternions only form an associative group—in particular, a non-Abelian group. The quaternions are the most widely known and used hypercomplex numbers, though they have been mostly replaced in practice by operations with matrices and vectors. Still, the quaternions can be regarded as a four-dimensional vector space formed by combining a real number with a three-dimensional vector, with a basis (set of generating vectors) given by the unit vectors 1, i, j, and k such that 
i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1.
