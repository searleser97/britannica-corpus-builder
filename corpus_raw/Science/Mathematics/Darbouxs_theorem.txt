Darboux’s theorem,  in analysis (a branch of mathematics), statement that for a function f(x) that is differentiable (has derivatives) on the closed interval [a, b], then for every x with f′(a) < x < f′(b), there exists some point c in the open interval (a, b) such that f′(c) = x. In other words, the derivative function, though it is not necessarily continuous, follows the intermediate value theorem by taking every value that lies between the values of the derivatives at the endpoints. The intermediate value theorem, which implies Darboux’s theorem when the derivative function is continuous, is a familiar result in calculus that states, in simplest terms, that if a continuous real-valued function f defined on the closed interval [−1, 1] satisfies f(−1) < 0 and f(1) > 0, then f(x) = 0 for at least one number x between −1 and 1; less formally, an unbroken curve passes through every value between its endpoints. Darboux’s theorem was first proved in the 19th century by the French mathematician Jean-Gaston Darboux.
