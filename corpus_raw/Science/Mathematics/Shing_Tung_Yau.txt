Shing-Tung Yau,  (born April 4, 1949, Swatow, China), Chinese-born mathematician who won the 1982 Fields Medal for his work in differential geometry.
Yau received a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971. Between 1971 and 1987 he held appointments at a number of institutions, including Stanford (Calif.) University (1974–79), the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J. (1979–84), and the University of California, San Diego (1984–87). In 1987 he became a professor at Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.
Yau received the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Warsaw in 1983 for his work in global differential geometry and elliptic partial differential equations, particularly for solving such difficult problems as the Calabi conjecture of 1954 for both the Kähler and Einstein-Kähler metric cases, the positive mass conjecture (with Richard Schoen), and a problem of Hermann Minkowski’s concerning the Dirichlet problem for the real Monge-Ampère equation. In the early 1980s Yau and William H. Meeks solved an open question remaining from Jesse Douglas’s work on the Plateau problem in the 1930s.
Yau’s publications include Non-linear Analysis in Geometry (1986) and, with Robert Greene, Differential Geometry (1993).
