polar coordinates,  system of locating points in a plane with reference to a fixed point O (the origin) and a ray from the origin usually chosen to be the positive x-axis. The coordinates are written (r,θ), in which ris the distance from the origin to any desired point P and θis the angle made by the line OP and the axis. A simple relationship exists between Cartesian coordinates(x,y) and the polar coordinates (r,θ),namely: x= rcos θ,and y= rsin θ.
An analog of polar coordinates, called spherical coordinates, may also be used to locate points in three-dimensional space. The system used involves again the distance from the origin O to a given point P, the angle θ,measured between OP and the positive zaxis, and a second angle ϕ,measured between the positive xaxis and the projection of OP onto the x,yplane. Those angles are essentially the colatitude and longitude used to express locations on the Earth’s surface, where the colatitude is 90 degrees minus the latitude.
