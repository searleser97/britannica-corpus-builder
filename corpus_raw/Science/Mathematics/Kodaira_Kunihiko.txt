Kodaira Kunihiko,  (born March 16, 1915, Tokyo, Japan—died July 26, 1997, Kōfu), Japanese mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1954 for his work in algebraic geometry and complex analysis.
Kodaira attended the University of Tokyo (Ph.D., 1949). His dissertation attracted the attention of Hermann Weyl, who invited Kodaira to join him at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S., where he remained until 1961. After appointments at Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts), Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Maryland), and Stanford University (California), he returned to the University of Tokyo in 1967. He retired in 1985.
Kodaira was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam in 1954. Influenced by Weyl’s book on Riemann surfaces, Kodaira conducted research on Riemannian manifolds and Kählerian manifolds. It was in this latter area and in a special subset of these, the Hodge manifolds, that he achieved some of his most important results. In collaboration for many years with the American mathematician D.C. Spencer, he created a theory of the deformation of complex manifolds. Kodaira was principally an algebraic geometer, and his work in this field culminated in his remarkable proof of the Riemann-Roch theorem for functions of any number of variables. In later years he developed an interest in the teaching of mathematics and produced, in collaboration with others, a series of mathematics textbooks for elementary and secondary schools.
Kodaira’s publications include, with Georges de Rham, Harmonic Integrals (1950); with D.C. Spencer, On Deformations of Complex Analytic Structures (1957); with James Morrow, Complex Manifolds (1971); and Complex Manifolds and Deformation of Complex Structures (1986). His Collected Works was published in 1975.
