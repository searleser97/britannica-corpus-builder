Descartes’s rule of signs,  in algebra, rule for determining the maximum number of positive real number solutions (roots) of a polynomial equation in one variable based on the number of times that the signs of its real number coefficients change when the terms are arranged in the canonical order (from highest power to lowest power). For example, the polynomial 
x5 + x4 − 2x3 + x2 − 1 = 0
changes sign three times, so it has at most three positive real solutions. Substituting −x for x gives the maximum number of negative solutions (two).
The rule of signs was given, without proof, by the French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes in La Géométrie (1637). The English physicist and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton restated the formula in 1707, though no proof of his has been discovered; some mathematicians speculate that he considered its proof too trivial to bother recording. The earliest known proof was by the French mathematician Jean-Paul de Gua de Malves in 1740. The German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss made the first real advance in 1828 when he showed that, in cases where there are fewer than the maximum number of positive roots, the deficit is always by an even number. Thus, in the example given above, the polynomial could have three positive roots or one positive root, but it could not have two positive roots.
