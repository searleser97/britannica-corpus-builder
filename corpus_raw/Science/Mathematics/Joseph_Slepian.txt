Joseph Slepian,  (born Feb. 11, 1891, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died  Dec. 1, 1969, Swissvale, Pa.), American electrical engineer and mathematician credited with important developments in electrical apparatus and theory.
Slepian studied at Harvard University, earning the Ph.D. in 1913. After a postdoctoral year in Europe he taught mathematics at Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y., for a year before joining the research staff of the Westinghouse Electric Company (from 1945, Corporation). There he worked for the next 40 years, becoming associate director of research in 1938.
Slepian’s work led to improvements in such electronic devices as lighting arresters, circuit breakers, high-voltage fuses, and rectifiers. He invented the autovalve lightning arrester, a device for the protection of large power-distribution systems, and he studied the effect of thunderstorms on electric-power transmission and distribution circuits. He proposed new theories about the conduction of electricity through gases and about the nature of arc cathodes.
In 1927 he patented a method of electron acceleration by magnetic induction, which became the basis of the betatron. During World War II he worked on an ionic centrifugal method for the separation of uranium isotopes.
