August Leopold Crelle,  (born March 11, 1780, Eichwerder, Brandenburg [Germany]—died October 6, 1855, Berlin), German mathematician and engineer who advanced the work and careers of many young mathematicians of his day and founded the Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (“Journal for Pure and Applied Mathematics”), now known as Crelle’s Journal.
A civil engineer in the service of the Prussian government until 1828, he worked on the planning and construction of roads and the first railroad (completed 1838) in Germany. Crelle was more interested in educational matters, however, and in 1828 he left government service to work with the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Education. His greatest contribution to mathematics was the founding of Crelle’s Journal in 1826. Crelle was not a first-rank mathematician, but he had a sure instinct for recognizing genius, and the young mathematicians Niels Abel of Norway and Jakob Steiner of Switzerland, who were the chief contributors to the first volumes, rose to fame along with the journal. Without Crelle’s generous support and encouragement, some of Abel’s greatest work might never have been completed and published.
