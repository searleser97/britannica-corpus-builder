Elliptic equation,  any of a class of partial differential equations describing phenomena that do not change from moment to moment, as when a flow of heat or fluid takes place within a medium with no accumulations. The Laplace equation, uxx + uyy = 0, is the simplest such equation describing this condition in two dimensions. In addition to satisfying a differential equation within the region, the elliptic equation is also determined by its values (boundary values) along the boundary of the region, which represent the effect from outside the region. These conditions can be either those of a fixed temperature distribution at points of the boundary (Dirichlet problem) or those in which heat is being supplied or removed across the boundary in such a way as to maintain a constant temperature distribution throughout (Neumann problem).
If the highest-order terms of a second-order partial differential equation with constant coefficients are linear and if the coefficients a, b, c of the uxx, uxy, uyy terms satisfy the inequality b2 − 4ac < 0, then, by a change of coordinates, the principal part (highest-order terms) can be written as the Laplacian uxx + uyy. Because the properties of a physical system are independent of the coordinate system used to formulate the problem, it is expected that the properties of the solutions of these elliptic equations should be similar to the properties of the solutions of Laplace’s equation (see harmonic function). If the coefficients a, b, and c are not constant but depend on x and y, then the equation is called elliptic in a given region if b2 − 4ac < 0 at all points in the region. The functions x2 − y2 and excos y satisfy the Laplace equation, but the solutions to this equation are usually more complicated because of the boundary conditions that must be satisfied as well.
