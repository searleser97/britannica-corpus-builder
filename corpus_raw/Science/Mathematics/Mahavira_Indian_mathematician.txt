Mahavira,  (flourished c. 850, Karnataka, India), Indian mathematician who made significant contributions to the development of algebra.
All that is known about Mahavira’s life is that he was a Jain (he perhaps took his name to honour the great Jainism reformer Mahavira [c. 599–527 bce]) and that he wrote Ganitasarasangraha (“Compendium of the Essence of Mathematics”) during the reign of Amoghavarsha (c. 814–878) of the Rashtrakuta dynasty. The work comprises more than 1,130 versified rules and examples divided in nine chapters: the first chapter for “terminology” and the rest for “mathematical procedures” such as basic operations, reductions of fractions, miscellaneous problems involving a linear or quadratic equation with one unknown, the rule of three (involving proportionality), mixture problems, geometric computations with plane figures, ditches (solids), and shadows (similar right-angled triangles).
At the beginning of his work, Mahavira stresses the importance of mathematics in both secular and religious life and in all kinds of disciplines, including love and cooking. While giving rules for zero and negative quantities, he explicitly states that a negative number has no square root because it is not a square (of any “real number”). Besides mixture problems (interest and proportions), he treats various types of linear and quadratic equations (where he admits two positive solutions) and improves on the methods of Aryabhata (born 476). He also treats various arithmetic and geometric, as well as complex, series (see infinite series). For rough computations, Mahavira used 3 as an approximation for π, while for more exact computations he used the traditional Jain value of Square root of√10. He also included rules for permutations and combinations and for the area of a conchlike plane figure (two unequal semicircles stuck together along their diameters), all traditional Jain topics.
