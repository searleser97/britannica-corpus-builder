Pappus’s theorem,  in mathematics, theorem named for the 4th-century Greek geometer Pappus of Alexandria that describes the volume of a solid, obtained by revolving a plane region D about a line L not intersecting D, as the product of the area of D and the length of the circular path traversed by the centroid of D during the revolution. To illustrate Pappus’s theorem, consider a circular disk of radius a units situated in a plane, and suppose that its centre is located b units from a line L in the same plane, measured perpendicularly, where b > a. When the disk is revolved through 360 degrees about L, its centre travels along a circular path of circumference 2πb units (twice the product of π and the radius of the path). Since the area of the disk is πa2 square units (the product of π and the square of the radius of the disk), Pappus’s theorem declares that the volume of the solid torus obtained is (πa2) × (2πb) = 2π2a2b cubic units.
Pappus stated this result, along with a similar theorem concerning the area of a surface of revolution, in his Mathematical Collection, which contained many challenging geometric ideas and would be of great interest to mathematicians in later centuries. Pappus’s theorems are sometimes also known as Guldin’s theorems, after the Swiss Paul Guldin, one of many Renaissance mathematicians interested in centres of gravity. Guldin published his rediscovered version of Pappus’s results in 1641.
Pappus’s theorem has been generalized to the case in which the region is allowed to move along any sufficiently smooth (no corners), simple (no self intersection), closed curve. In this case the volume of the solid generated equals the product of the area of the region and the length of the path traversed by the centroid. In 1794 the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler provided such a generalization, with subsequent work done by modern-day mathematicians.
