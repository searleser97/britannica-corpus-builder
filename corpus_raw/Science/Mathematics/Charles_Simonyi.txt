Charles Simonyi, original name Simonyi Karolyi,  (born September 10, 1948, Budapest, Hungary), Hungarian-born American software executive and space tourist.
Simonyi left Hungary in 1966 to work at the Danish computer company Regnecentralen. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a degree in engineering mathematics and later earned a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University. After working at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC)—where he created the first WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) text editor—from 1972 to 1980, Simonyi joined the Microsoft Corporation in 1981. While at Microsoft he led the development of the widely used software applications Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. In 2002 he left Microsoft to found his own firm, Intentional Software. However, he returned in 2017 after selling the company to Microsoft.
In 2007, for the price of $20 million, Simonyi become the fifth paying traveler sent into space by the American space tourism company Space Adventures, Ltd. After a six-month training program at the Yury Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Star City, Russia, Simonyi was launched into space from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard Soyuz TMA-10 on April 7, 2007, with two Russian cosmonauts, Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov. On April 9 he arrived at the International Space Station (ISS), where he spent 11 days performing scientific experiments and communicating via amateur radio with high school students. He returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TMA-9, landing in the Kazakhstan steppes on April 21.
On March 26, 2009, he lifted off with Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka and U.S. astronaut Michael Barratt aboard Soyuz TMA-14, a flight to the ISS that made Simonyi the first repeat space tourist. They returned to Earth on April 8, traveling on Soyuz TMA-13.
