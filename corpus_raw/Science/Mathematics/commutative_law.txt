Commutative law,  in mathematics, either of two laws relating to number operations of addition and multiplication, stated symbolically: a + b = b + a and ab = ba. From these laws it follows that any finite sum or product is unaltered by reordering its terms or factors. While commutativity holds for many systems, such as the real or complex numbers, there are other systems, such as the system of n × n matrices or the system of quaternions, in which commutativity of multiplication is invalid. Scalar multiplication of two vectors (to give the so-called dot product) is commutative (i.e., a·b = b·a), but vector multiplication (to give the cross product) is not (i.e., a × b = −b × a). The commutative law does not necessarily hold for multiplication of conditionally convergent series. See also associative law; distributive law.
