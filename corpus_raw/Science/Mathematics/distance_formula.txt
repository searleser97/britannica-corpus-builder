Distance formula,  Algebraic expression that gives the distances between pairs of points in terms of their coordinates (see coordinate system). In two- and three-dimensional Euclidean space, the distance formulas for points in rectangular coordinates are based on the Pythagorean theorem. The distance between the points (a,b) and (c,d) is given by Square root of√(a − c)2 + (b − d)2. In three dimensional space, the distance between the points (a, b, c) and (d, e, f) is Square root of√(a − d)2 + (b − e)2 + (c − f)2.
