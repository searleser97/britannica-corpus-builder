Mean-value theorem,  theorem in mathematical analysis dealing with a type of average useful for approximations and for establishing other theorems, such as the fundamental theorem of calculus.
The theorem states that the slope of a line connecting any two points on a “smooth” curve is the same as the slope of some line tangent to the curve at a point between the two points. In other words, at some point the slope of the curve must equal its average slope (see figure). In symbols, if the function f(x) represents the curve, a and b the two endpoints, and c the point between, then [f(b) − f(a)]/(b − a) = f′(c), in which f′(c) represents the slope of the tangent line at c, as given by the derivative.
Although the mean-value theorem seemed obvious geometrically, proving the result without appeal to diagrams involved a deep examination of the properties of real numbers and continuous functions. Other mean-value theorems can be obtained from this basic one by letting f(x) be some special function.
