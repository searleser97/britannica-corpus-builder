Quadrature,  in mathematics, the process of determining the area of a plane geometric figure by dividing it into a collection of shapes of known area (usually rectangles) and then finding the limit (as the divisions become ever finer) of the sum of these areas. When this process is performed with solid figures to find volume, the process is called cubature. A similar process called rectification is used in determining the length of a curve. The curve is divided into a sequence of straight line segments of known length. Because the definite integral of a function determines the area under its curve, integration is still sometimes referred to as quadrature.
