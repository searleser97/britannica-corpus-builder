Michael Freedman, in full Michael Hartley Freedman,  (born April 21, 1951, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), American mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1986 for his solution of the Poincaré conjecture in four dimensions.
Freedman received a Ph.D. from Princeton (New Jersey) University in 1973. Following appointments at the University of California, Berkeley (1973–75), and the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey (1975–76), Freedman became a professor at the University of California, San Diego, in 1976. In 1998 he became the first Fields Medal winner to leave the academic world when he accepted a position with the Theory Group at Microsoft Research, a division of Microsoft Corporation.
Freedman was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berkeley in 1986. At the beginning of the 20th century, Henri Poincaré developed a system for classifying manifolds. As Poincaré discovered, three-dimensional manifolds pose some special complications in this classification problem. The n-dimensional Poincaré conjecture states that every topological n-manifold having the same homology and the same fundamental group as an n-dimensional sphere must be homeomorphic to the n-dimensional sphere. The cases of the conjecture in dimensions one and two were handled in the 19th century, and Stephen Smale solved the cases where n ≥ 5 in 1961. Freedman’s work solved the Poincaré conjecture in four dimensions. Actually, Freedman’s result was stronger than the Poincaré conjecture itself and, along with the work of Simon Donaldson, produced the surprising result that ordinary four-space has many exotic differential structures.
Freedman’s publications included, with Frank Quinn, Topology of 4-Manifolds (1990); Surgery on Codimension 2 Submanifolds (1977); Classification of Four-Dimensional Spaces (1982); and, with Feng Luo, Selected Applications of Geometry to Low-Dimensional Topology (1989).
