Charles-François Sturm, in full Jacques-Charles-François Sturm,  (born September 29, 1803, Geneva, Switzerland—died December 18, 1855, Paris, France), French mathematician whose work resulted in Sturm’s theorem, an important contribution to the theory of equations.
As tutor of the de Broglie family in Paris (1823–24), Sturm met many of the leading French scientists and mathematicians. In 1826, with the Swiss engineer Daniel Colladon, he made the first accurate determination of the velocity of sound in water, and a year later he wrote a prizewinning essay on compressible fluids.
Sturm’s theorem first appeared in Mémoire sur la résolution des équations numériques (1829; “Treatise on Numerical Equations”) and provided a complete solution to the problem—one that had been wrestled with since the time of René Descartes—of finding the number of roots (or solutions) of an algebraic equation within a given range of the variable.
Published in 1834, Sturm’s work on the theory of differential equations of the second order, conducted with his friend Joseph Liouville, won him prestigious awards in France. He was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1836 and became a professor of mathematics at the École Polytechnique in Paris in 1838. Two years later he succeeded Siméon-Denis Poisson in the chair of mechanics at the Faculty of Sciences, Paris. Although primarily an analyst, Sturm made significant contributions to projective geometry and to the differential geometry of curves and surfaces. He also did important work on geometrical optics. Published posthumously, his Cours d’analyse de l’École Polytechnique, 2 vol. (1857–63; “Analysis Course from the École Polytechnique”), and Cours de méchanique de l’École Polytechnique, 2 vol. (1861; “Mechanics Course from the École Polytechnique”), were widely used, even in the early 20th century.
