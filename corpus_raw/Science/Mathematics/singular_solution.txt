Singular solution,   in mathematics, solution of a differential equation that cannot be obtained from the general solution gotten by the usual method of solving the differential equation. When a differential equation is solved, a general solution consisting of a family of curves is obtained. For example, (yâ€²)2 = 4y has the general solution y = (x + c)2, which is a family of parabolas (see Graph). The line y = 0 is also a solution of the differential equation, but it is not a member of the family constituting the general solution. The singular solution is related to the general solution by its being what is called the envelope of that family of curves representing the general solution. An envelope is defined as the curve that is tangent to a given family of curves. If the singular solution is an envelope, it can be found from the general solution by solving the maximum (or minimum) problem of finding the value of the parameter c for which y has a maximum (or minimum) value for a fixed x, and then substituting this value for c back into the general solution. In the example given, y has its minimum value for each x when c = -x, giving the singular solution as indicated.
