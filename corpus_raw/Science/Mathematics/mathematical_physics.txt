Mathematical physics,  Branch of mathematical analysis that emphasizes tools and techniques of particular use to physicists and engineers. It focuses on vector spaces, matrix algebra, differential equations (especially for boundary value problems), integral equations, integral transforms, infinite series, and complex variables. Its approach can be tailored to applications in electromagnetism, classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics.
