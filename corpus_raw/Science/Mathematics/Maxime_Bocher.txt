Maxime Bôcher,  (born Aug. 28, 1867, Boston, Mass., U.S.—died Sept. 12, 1918, Cambridge, Mass.), American mathematician and educator whose teachings and writings influenced many mathematical researchers.
Bôcher graduated from Harvard University in 1888 and received his doctorate from the University of Göttingen in 1891. Within months of acquiring his Ph.D., Bôcher was asked to join the faculty at Harvard as an instructor in mathematics; this association lasted until his death. He became an assistant professor in 1894 and, 10 years later, professor.
By combining teaching with his research in differential equations, series, and higher algebra, Bocher developed a considerable reputation. He published nearly a hundred papers and reviews, of which his work on algebra, published in 1907, provided new insights. His Harvard seminars were fully attended and served as a seminal training ground for many who went on to become mathematical leaders in teaching and research.
