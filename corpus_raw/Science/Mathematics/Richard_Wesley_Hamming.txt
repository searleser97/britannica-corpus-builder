Richard Wesley Hamming,  (born Feb. 11, 1915, Chicago, Ill., U.S.—died Jan. 7, 1998, Monterey, Calif.), American mathematician. Hamming received a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Illinois. In 1945 he was the chief mathematician for the Manhattan Project. After World War II, he joined Claude E. Shannon at Bell Laboratories, where in 1950 he invented Hamming codes, which are used in telecommunications. He realized that, by the appending of a parity check (an extra bit or block of bits) to each transmitted “word,” transmission errors could be corrected automatically, without having to resend the message. He is famous for saying, “The purpose of computation is insight, not numbers.” In 1968 he received the A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science.
