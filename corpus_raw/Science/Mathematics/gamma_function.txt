Gamma function,  generalization of the factorial function to nonintegral values, introduced by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century.
For a positive whole number n, the factorial (written as n!) is defined by n! = 1 × 2 × 3 ×⋯× (n − 1) × n. For example, 5! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120. But this formula is meaningless if n is not an integer.
To extend the factorial to any real number x > 0 (whether or not x is a whole number), the gamma function is defined as 
Γ(x) = Integral on the interval [0, ∞ ] of
			∫
			0∞t x −1 e−t dt.
Using techniques of integration, it can be shown that Γ(1) = 1. Similarly, using a technique from calculus known as integration by parts, it can be proved that the gamma function has the following recursive property: if x > 0, then Γ(x + 1) = xΓ(x). From this it follows that Γ(2) = 1 Γ(1) = 1; Γ(3) = 2 Γ(2) = 2 × 1 = 2!; Γ(4) = 3 Γ(3) = 3 × 2 × 1 = 3!; and so on. Generally, if x is a natural number (1, 2, 3,…), then Γ(x) = (x − 1)! The function can be extended to negative non-integer real numbers and to complex numbers as long as the real part is greater than or equal to 1. While the gamma function behaves like a factorial for natural numbers (a discrete set), its extension to the positive real numbers (a continuous set) makes it useful for modeling situations involving continuous change,  with important applications to calculus, differential equations, complex analysis, and statistics.
