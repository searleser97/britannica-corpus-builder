limit,  mathematical concept based on the idea of closeness, used primarily to assign values to certain functions at points where no values are defined, in such a way as to be consistent with nearby values. For example, the function (x2 − 1)/(x − 1) is not defined when x is 1, because division by zero is not a valid mathematical operation. For any other value of x, the numerator can be factored and divided by the (x − 1), giving x + 1. Thus, this quotient is equal to x + 1 for all values of x except 1, which has no value. However, 2 can be assigned to the function (x2 − 1)/(x − 1) not as its value when x equals 1 but as its limit when x approaches 1.Seeanalysis: Continuity of functions.
One way of defining the limit of a function f(x) at a point x0, written as  is by the following: if there is a continuous (unbroken) function g(x) such that g(x) = f(x) in some interval around x0, except possibly at x0 itself, then 
The following more-basic definition of limit, independent of the concept of continuity, can also be given:  if, for any desired degree of closeness ε, one can find an interval around x0 so that all values of f(x) calculated here differ from L by an amount less than ε (i.e., if |x − x0| < δ, then |f (x) − L| < ε). This last definition can be used to determine whether or not a given number is in fact a limit. The calculation of limits, especially of quotients, usually involves manipulations of the function so that it can be written in a form in which the limit is more obvious, as in the above example of (x2 − 1)/(x − 1).
Limits are the method by which the derivative, or rate of change, of a function is calculated, and they are used throughout analysis as a way of making approximations into exact quantities, as when the area inside a curved region is defined to be the limit of approximations by rectangles.
