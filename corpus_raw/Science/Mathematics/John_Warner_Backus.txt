John Warner Backus,  (born Dec. 3, 1924, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.â€”died March 17, 2007, Ashland, Ore.), American computer scientist and mathematician who led the team that designed FORTRAN (formula translation), the first important algorithmic language for computers.
Restless as a young man, Backus found his niche in mathematics, earning a B.S. (1949) and an M.A. (1950) from Columbia University in New York City. He joined the computer manufacturer International Business Machines (IBM) in 1950. Tired of laborious hand coding, he was granted permission to assemble a team at IBM that would work on improving efficiency. His small group at IBM developed the computer language FORTRAN for numerical analysis. FORTRAN produced programs that were as good as those written by professional programmers.
The Backus Normal, or Backus-Naur, Form for defining the syntax of a programmable language was developed by Backus (1959) and later Peter Naur, both of whom in 1960 contributed to the development of ALGOL 60, an international scientific programming language.
He retired from IBM in 1991. Among his many honours, Backus received the National Medal of Science (1975), the Turing Award (1977), and the Charles Stark Draper Prize (1993), the highest award given by the National Academy of Engineering.
