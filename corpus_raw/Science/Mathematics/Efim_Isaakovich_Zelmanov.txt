Efim Zelmanov, in full Efim Isaakovich Zelmanov,  (born September 7, 1955, Khabarovsk, Russia, U.S.S.R.), Russian mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1994 for his work in group theory.
Zelmanov was educated at Novosibirsk State University (Ph.D., 1980) and Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) State University (D.Sc., 1985). He worked at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. in Novosibirsk until 1987. He then left the Soviet Union, eventually settling at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (U.S.), in 1990. He moved to the University of Chicago in 1994 and on to Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, in 1995. Zelmanov joined the faculty at the University of California, San Diego, in 2002.
Zelmanov was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich. His prizewinning work was not directly related to his main field of research, nonassociative algebras. However, he made spectacular advances in group theory by solving the century-old restricted Burnside problem, using the theory of Lie algebras. Zelmanov’s broad interests were critically important in this work, as a proof of his major result probably could not have been carried out by a traditional group theorist or Lie theorist. Zelmanov also made important contributions to the study of Jordan algebras, which are of interest in the study of quantum mechanics.
Zelmanov’s publications include Nil Rings and Periodic Groups (1992).
