Shen Kuo, Wade-Giles romanization Shen K’uo,  (born 1031, Qiantang [now Hangzhou, Zhejiang province], China—died  1095, Jingkou [now Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province]), Chinese astronomer, mathematician, and high official whose famous work Mengxi bitan (“Brush Talks from Dream Brook” [Dream Brook was the name of his estate in Jingkou]) contains the first reference to the magnetic compass, the first description of movable type, and a fairly accurate explanation of the origin of fossils. The Mengxi bitan also contains Shen’s observations on such varied subjects as mathematics, astronomy, atmospheric phenomena, cartography, optics, and medicine. Shen produced a number of works, including commentaries on the Confucian Classics, atlases, diplomatic reports, and a variety of monographs. His Mengxi bitan was written relatively late in life, after he had been removed from office on a trumped-up charge and banished after troops under his titular command suffered a severe defeat by Tangut warriors; some 60,000 Chinese perished in the battle. He retired to Dream Brook in 1088 and lived out the remainder of his years there.
