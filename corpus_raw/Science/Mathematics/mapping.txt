Mapping,  any prescribed way of assigning to each object in one set a particular object in another (or the same) set. Mapping applies to any set: a collection of objects, such as all whole numbers, all the points on a line, or all those inside a circle. For example, “multiply by two” defines a mapping of the set of all whole numbers onto the set of even numbers. A rotation is a map of a plane or of all of space into itself. In mathematics, the words mapping, map, and transformation tend to be used interchangeably.
The mathematical notion of mapping is an abstraction of the process of making a geographical map. It is now considered to be a fundamental notion pervading much of mathematics. Important special classes of mappings are homomorphisms in algebra, isometries in geometry, operators in analysis, homeomorphisms in topology, representations
in group theory, and isomorphisms in a variety of contexts (see foundations of mathematics: Isomorphic structures).
