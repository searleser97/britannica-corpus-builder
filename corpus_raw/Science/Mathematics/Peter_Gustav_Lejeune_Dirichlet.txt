Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet,  (born Feb. 13, 1805, Düren, French Empire [now in Germany]—died  May 5, 1859, Göttingen, Hanover), German mathematician who made valuable contributions to number theory, analysis, and mechanics. He taught at the universities of Breslau (1827) and Berlin (1828–55) and in 1855 succeeded Carl Friedrich Gauss at the University of Göttingen.
Dirichlet made notable contributions still associated with his name in many fields of mathematics. In number theory he proved the existence of an infinite number of primes in any arithmetic series a + b, 2a + b, 3a + b, . . ., na + b, in which a and b are not divisible by one another. He developed the general theory of units in algebraic number theory. His Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie (1863; “Lectures Concerning Number Theory”), with later addenda, contains some material important to the theory of ideals.
In 1837 Dirichlet proposed the modern concept of a function y = f (x) in which for every x, there is associated with it a unique y. In mechanics he investigated the equilibrium of systems and potential theory, which led him to the Dirichlet problem concerning harmonic functions with prescribed boundary values. His Gesammelte Werke (1889, 1897; “Collected Works”) was published in two volumes.
