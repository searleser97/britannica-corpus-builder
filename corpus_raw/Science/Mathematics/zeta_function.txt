zeta function,  in number theory, an infinite series given by  where z and w are complex numbers and the real part of z is greater than zero. For w = 0, the function reduces to the Riemann zeta function, named for the 19th-century German mathematician Bernhard Riemann, whose study of its properties led him to formulate the Riemann hypothesis.
The zeta function has a pole, or isolated singularity, at z = 1, where the infinite series diverges to infinity. (A function such as this, which only has isolated singularities, is known as meromorphic.) For z = 1 and w = 0, the zeta function reduces to the harmonic series, or sum of the harmonic sequence (1,1/2,1/3,1/4,â€¦), which has been studied since at least the 6th century bce, when Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras and his followers sought to explain through numbers the nature of the universe and the theory of musical harmony.
