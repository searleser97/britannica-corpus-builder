Charles Louis Fefferman,  (born April 18, 1949, Washington, D.C., U.S.), American mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1978 for his work in classical analysis.
Fefferman attended the University of Maryland (B.S., 1966) and Princeton (N.J.) University. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1969, he remained at Princeton for a year, then moved to the University of Chicago. He returned to Princeton in 1974.
Fefferman was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki, Fin., in 1978. His work has been in classical analysis—specifically partial differential equations, Fourier analysis, and the theory of functions of several complex variables. After a period of abstract generalization in the 1940s and ’50s, Fefferman was part of a resurgence of work in classical analysis, in the 1960s and ’70s, through the unification of methods from harmonic analysis, complex variables, and differential equations, coupled with the use of combinatorial arguments.
Fefferman’s publications include, with Robert Fefferman and Stephen Wainger, Essays on Fourier Analysis in Honor of Elias M. Stein (1995).
