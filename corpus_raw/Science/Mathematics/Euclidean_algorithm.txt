Euclidean algorithm,  procedure for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, described by the Greek mathematician Euclid in his Elements (c. 300 bc). The method is computationally efficient and, with minor modifications, is still used by computers.
The algorithm involves successively dividing and calculating remainders; it is best illustrated by example. For instance, to find the GCD of 56 and 12, first divide 56 by 12 and note that the quotient is 4 and the remainder is 8. This can be expressed as 56 = 4 × 12 + 8. Now take the divisor (12), divide it by the remainder (8), and write the result as 12 = 1 × 8 + 4. Continuing in this manner, take the previous divisor (8), divide it by the previous remainder (4), and write the result as 8 = 2 × 4 + 0. Since the remainder is now 0, the process has finished and the last nonzero remainder, in this case 4, is the GCD.
The Euclidean algorithm is useful for reducing a common fraction to lowest terms. For example, the algorithm will show that the GCD of 765 and 714 is 51, and therefore 765/714 = 15/14. It also has a number of uses in more advanced mathematics. For example, it is the basic tool used to find integer solutions to linear equations ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. The algorithm also provides, as the successive quotients obtained from the division process, the integers a, b, …, f needed for the expansion of a fraction p/q as a continued fraction: 
a + 1/(b + 1/(c + 1/(d … + 1/f).
