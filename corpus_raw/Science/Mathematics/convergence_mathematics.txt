Convergence,  in mathematics, property (exhibited by certain infinite series and functions) of approaching a limit more and more closely as an argument (variable) of the function increases or decreases or as the number of terms of the series increases.
For example, the function y = 1/x converges to zero as x increases. Although no finite value of x will cause the value of y to actually become zero, the limiting value of y is zero because y can be made as small as desired by choosing x large enough. The line y = 0 (the x-axis) is called an asymptote of the function.
Similarly, for any value of x between (but not including) −1 and +1, the series 1 + x + x2 +⋯+ xn converges toward the limit 1/(1 − x) as n, the number of terms, increases. The interval −1 < x < 1 is called the range of convergence of the series; for values of x outside this range, the series is said to diverge.
