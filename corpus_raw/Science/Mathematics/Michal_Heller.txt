Michał Heller, in full Michał Kazimierz Heller,  (born March 12, 1936, Tarnow, Pol.), Roman Catholic priest and mathematical cosmologist who championed a world view that combined mathematical physics, theology, and philosophy.
Heller was born in southern Poland. When he was four years old, his father helped to sabotage the chemical plant in which he worked, and the family fled to the U.S.S.R. to escape the advancing Nazi invaders. During a roundup of Polish refugees, the Hellers were sent to a labour camp in Sakha (Yakutia) in Siberia, where they withstood the attendant hardships chiefly through fortitude and their strong Roman Catholic faith. After World War II they were sent back to Poland, where in 1953 Heller completed his secondary schooling and entered the seminary in Tarnow. Having received a master’s degree in theology and taken ordination in 1959, he was given a parish near his hometown.
The following year he began courses in science and mathematics at the Catholic University of Lublin, which was at the time virtually the only institution in communist Poland where a priest could pursue advanced studies. He received a master’s degree in philosophy (1965), a doctorate (1966), and a habilitation degree (1969) with a thesis titled “Mach’s Principle in Relativistic Cosmology.” In 1972 Heller began his association with the Pontifical Faculty (later Academy) of Theology in Krakow. He was given the rank of associate professor in 1985 and professor in 1990. He was appointed rector of the Institute of Theology in Tarnow in 1991 and dean of its faculty of theology in 2000. The government allowed Heller to travel outside Poland only from the mid-1970s, but he subsequently visited or held positions at the Catholic University of Louvain (1977 and 1982) and the University of Liège (1996) in Belgium, the Universities of Oxford and Leicester in England (1982), the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. (1986), and the Vatican Observatory in Castel Gandolfo, Italy (1986).
Heller was made a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1991. In 2008 he was awarded the £820,000 (more than $1.6 million) Templeton Prize for Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities in honour of his dedication to understanding and explaining the interaction of science and religion.
