Algebraic topology,  Field of mathematics that uses algebraic structures to study transformations of geometric objects. It uses functions (often called maps in this context) to represent continuous transformations (see topology). Taken together, a set of maps and objects may form an algebraic group, which can be analyzed by group-theory methods. A well-known topic in algebraic topology is the four-colour map problem.
