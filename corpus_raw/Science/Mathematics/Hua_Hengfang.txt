Hua Hengfang, also known as Hua Ruoting,  (born 1833, Wuxi, Jiangsu province, China—died 1902, China), Chinese mathematician and translator of Western mathematical works.
Apparently inspired by Li Shanlan (1811–82), Hua was an early enthusiastic proponent of Western-style mathematics. Like Li, Hua served as a translator, mainly in collaboration with the English missionary John Fryer, of Western works on mathematics and science. Not a particularly talented mathematician, Hua’s personal struggles to understand mathematical materials resulted in exceptionally lucid translations—particularly his fluent and accessible presentations of works on algebra and calculus. His translations were widely read and adopted by many of the new Western-style schools founded in China in the 19th century by the government and Christian missionaries; he also honed his pedagogical skills at some of these institutions, such as the Chinese Polytechnic Institution at Shanghai in 1876, the Tianjing Military School in 1887, the Academy of Hubei and Hunan in 1892, and the first Chinese Western-style elementary school in Jiangsu in 1898.
