Gradient,  in mathematics, a differential operator applied to a three-dimensional vector-valued function to yield a vector whose three components are the partial derivatives of the function with respect to its three variables. The symbol for gradient is ∇. Thus, the gradient of a function f, written grad f or ∇f, is ∇f = ifx + jfy + kfz where fx, fy, and fz are the first partial derivatives of f and the vectors i, j, and k are the unit vectors of the vector space. If in physics, for example, f is a temperature field (giving the temperature at every point in a space), ∇f is the direction of the heat-flow vector in the field.
