Logicism,  school of mathematical thought introduced by the 19thâ€“20th-century German mathematician Gottlob Frege and the British mathematician Bertrand Russell, which holds that mathematics is actually logic. Logicists contend that all of mathematics can be deduced from pure logic, without the use of any specifically mathematical concepts, such as number or set. Compare formalism; intuitionism.
