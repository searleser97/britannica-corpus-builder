Tobias Dantzig,  (born Feb. 19, 1884, Latvia, Russian Empire—died Aug. 9, 1956,  Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.), Latvian-born American mathematician, best known for his science and mathematics books written for the general public.
As a young man, Dantzig was caught distributing anti-tsarist political tracts and fled to Paris, where he studied mathematics under Henri Poincaré and met and married Anja Ourisson. In 1910 they moved to the United States, where at first he worked as a lumberjack in Oregon because of his lack of familiarity with the English language. During this period, their first son was born; George Dantzig would go on to become the father of linear programming. Tobias later attended Indiana University, from which he received a doctorate (1917) in mathematics. Dantzig subsequently taught at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md., Columbia University in New York City, and the University of Maryland.
Dantzig’s major works include Number: The Language of Science (1930), Aspects of Science (1937), Henri Poincaré, Critic of Crisis: Reflections on His Universe of Discourse (1954), and The Bequest of the Greeks (1955). Two of Dantzig’s essays, “Fingerprints” and “The Empty Column,” are included in Encyclopædia Britannica’s Gateway to the Great Books (1963).
