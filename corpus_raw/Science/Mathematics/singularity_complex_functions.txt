Singularity, also called singular point,  of a function of the complex variable z is a point at which it is not analytic (that is, the function cannot be expressed as an infinite series in powers of z) although, at points arbitrarily close to the singularity, the function may be analytic, in which case it is called an isolated singularity. In general, because a function behaves in an anomalous manner at singular points, singularities must be treated separately when analyzing the function, or mathematical model, in which they appear.
For example, the function f (z) = ez/z is analytic throughout the complex plane—for all values of z—except at the point z = 0, where the series expansion is not defined because it contains the term 1/z. The series is 
1/z + 1 + z/2 + z2/6 +⋯+ zn/(n+1)! +⋯
where the factorial symbol (k!) indicates the product of the integers from k down to 1. When the function is bounded in a neighbourhood around a singularity, the function can be redefined at the point to remove it; hence it is known as a removable singularity. In contrast, the above function tends to infinity as z approaches 0; thus, it is not bounded and the singularity is not removable (in this case, it is known as a simple pole).
