Harmonic sequence,  in mathematics, a sequence of numbers a1, a2, a3,… such that their reciprocals 1/a1, 1/a2, 1/a3,… form an arithmetic sequence (numbers separated by a common difference). The best-known harmonic sequence, and the one typically meant when the harmonic sequence is mentioned, is 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4,…, whose corresponding arithmetic sequence is simply the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,….
The study of harmonic sequences dates to at least the 6th century bce, when the Greek philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras and his followers sought to explain through numbers the nature of the universe. One of the areas in which numbers were applied by the Pythagoreans was the study of music. In particular, Archytas of Tarentum, in the 4th century bce, used the idea of regular numerical intervals to devise a theory of musical harmony (from the Greek harmonia, for agreement of sounds) and the enharmonic method of tuning musical instruments.
The sum of a sequence is known as a series, and the harmonic series is an example of an infinite series that does not converge to any limit. That is, the partial sums obtained by adding the successive terms grow without limit, or, put another way, the sum tends to infinity.
