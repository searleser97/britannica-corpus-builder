Conformal map,  In mathematics, a transformation of one graph into another in such a way that the angle of intersection of any two lines or curves remains unchanged. The most common example is the Mercator map, a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the earth that preserves compass directions. Other conformal maps, sometimes called orthomorphic projections, preserve angles but not shapes.
