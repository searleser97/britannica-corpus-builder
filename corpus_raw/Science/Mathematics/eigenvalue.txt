Eigenvalue,  one of a set of discrete values of a parameter, k, in an equation of the form Pψ = kψ, in which P is a linear operator (that is, a symbol denoting a linear operation to be performed), for which there are solutions satisfying given boundary conditions. The symbol ψ (psi) represents an eigenfunction (proper or characteristic function) belonging to that eigenvalue. The totality of eigenvalues is a set. In quantum mechanics P is frequently a Hamiltonian, or energy, operator and the eigenvalues are energy values, but operators corresponding to other dynamical variables such as total angular momentum are also used. Experimental measurements of the proper dynamical variable will yield eigenvalues.
