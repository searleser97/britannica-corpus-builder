Length, area, and volume,  Dimensional measures of one-, two-, and three-dimensional geometric objects. All three are magnitudes, representing the “size” of an object. Length is the size of a line segment (see distance formulas), area is the size of a closed region in a plane, and volume is the size of a solid. Formulas for area and volume are based on lengths. For example, the area of a circle equals π times the square of the length of its radius, and the volume of a rectangular box is the product of its three linear dimensions: length, width, and height.
