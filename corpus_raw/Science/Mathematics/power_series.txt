power series,  in mathematics, an infinite series that can be thought of as a polynomial with an infinite number of terms, such as 1 + x + x2 + x3 +⋯. Usually, a given power series will converge (that is, approach a finite sum) for all values of x within a certain interval around zero—in particular, whenever the absolute value of x is less than some positive number r, known as the radius of convergence. Outside of this interval the series diverges (is infinite), while the series may converge or diverge when x = ± r. The radius of convergence can often be determined by a version of the ratio test for power series: given a general power series a0 + a1x + a2x2 +⋯, in which the coefficients are known, the radius of convergence is equal to the limit of the ratio of successive coefficients. Symbolically, the series will converge for all values of x such that 
For instance, the infinite series 1 + x + x2 + x3 +⋯ has a radius of convergence of 1 (all the coefficients are 1)—that is, it converges for all −1 < x < 1—and within that interval the infinite series is equal to 1/(1 − x). Applying the ratio test to the series 1 + x/1! + x2/2! + x3/3! +⋯  (in which the factorial notation n! means the product of the counting numbers from 1 to n) gives a radius of convergence of  so that the series converges for any value of x.
Most functions can be represented by a power series in some interval (see table). Although a series may converge for all values of x, the convergence may be so slow for some values that using it to approximate a function will require calculating too many terms to make it useful. Instead of powers of x, sometimes a much faster convergence occurs for powers of (x − c), where c is some value near the desired value of x. Power series have also been used for calculating constants such as π and the natural logarithm base e and for solving differential equations.
