James W. Alexander II,  (born September 19, 1888, Sea Bright, New Jersey, U.S.—died September 23, 1971, Princeton, New Jersey), American mathematician and a founder of the branch of mathematics originally known as analysis situs, now called topology.
The son of John White Alexander, an American painter who created murals for the Library of Congress, James studied mathematics and physics at Princeton University, obtaining a B.S. degree in 1910 and an M.S. degree the following year. For the next few years he traveled and studied in Europe before submitting his doctoral dissertation (1915) to Princeton, where he taught until the United States’ entry into World War I in 1917. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army and served at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Alexander returned to Princeton in 1920, where he remained until 1933 when he joined the newly created Institute for Advanced Studies, a research institution spun off from Princeton. He remained with the institute until his retirement in 1951. Alexander also worked as a civilian consultant for the Army during World War II.
Alexander’s interest in the relationship of geometric figures that undergo transformation led to his developmental work in topology. His “horned sphere,” which is a remarkable deformation of the usual sphere, shows that the topology of three-dimensional space is very different from two-dimensional space. In 1928 Alexander discovered an invariant polynomial, now known as the Alexander polynomial, for distinguishing various knots regardless of how they are stretched or twisted. This was an important first step in providing an algebraic way of distinguishing knots (and therefore three-dimensional manifolds).
