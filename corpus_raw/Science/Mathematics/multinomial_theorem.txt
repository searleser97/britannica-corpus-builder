multinomial theorem,  in algebra, a generalization of the binomial theorem to more than two variables. In statistics, the corresponding multinomial series appears in the multinomial distribution, which is a generalization of the binomial distribution.
The multinomial theorem provides a formula for expanding an expression such as (x1 + x2 +⋯+ xk)n for integer values of n. In particular, the expansion is given by  where n1 + n2 +⋯+ nk = n and n! is the factorial notation for 1 × 2 × 3 ×⋯× n.
For example, the expansion of (x1 + x2 + x3)3 is x13 + 3x12x2 + 3x12x3 + 3x1x22 + 3x1x32 + 6x1x2x3 + x23 + 3x22x3 + 3x2x32 + x33.
