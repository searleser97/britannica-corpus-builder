Operator,  in mathematics, any symbol that indicates an operation to be performed. Examples are Square root of√x (which indicates the square root is to be taken) and d/dx (which indicates differentiation with respect to x is to be performed). An operator may be regarded as a function, transformation, or map, in the sense that it associates or “maps” elements from one set to elements from another set. See also automorphism.
