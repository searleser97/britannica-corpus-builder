Spherical coordinate system,  In geometry, a coordinate system in which any point in three-dimensional space is specified by its angle with respect to a polar axis and angle of rotation with respect to a prime meridian on a sphere of a given radius. In spherical coordinates a point is specified by the triplet (r, θ, φ), where r is the point’s distance from the origin (the radius), θ is the angle of rotation from the initial meridian plane, and φ is the angle from the polar axis (analogous to a ray from the origin through the North Pole).
