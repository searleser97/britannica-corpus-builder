Vladimir Drinfeld, in full Vladimir Gershonovich Drinfeld,  (born February 14, 1954, Kharkov, Ukraine, U.S.S.R. [now Kharkiv, Ukraine]), Ukrainian-born mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1990 for his work in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.
Drinfeld attended Moscow State University and the V.A. Steklov Institute of Mathematics, Moscow (Ph.D., 1988). He joined the Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering in Kharkov in 1985. In 1999 he began teaching at the University of Chicago.
His principal contributions have been in the theory of automorphic forms, algebraic geometry, and number theory. His interest in the last two led to his working on the Langlands Program, where he solved Langlandsâ€™ conjecture for a special but important case concerning Galois groups. His work in this area extended earlier explorations by Alexandre Grothendieck, Pierre Deligne, and Robert P. Langlands. Drinfeld also conducted research in mathematical physics, developing a classification theorem for quantum groups (a subclass of Hopf algebras). He also introduced the ideas of the Poisson-Lie group and Poisson-Lie actions in his work on Yang-Baxter equations, work also related to the quantum groups.
In addition to the Fields Medal, Drinfeld received the Wolf Prize (2018). He was elected (2016) to the National Academy of Sciences.
