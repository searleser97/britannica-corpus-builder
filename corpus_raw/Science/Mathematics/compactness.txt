Compactness,   in mathematics, property of some topological spaces (a generalization of Euclidean space) that has its main use in the study of functions defined on such spaces. An open covering of a space (or set) is a collection of open sets that covers the space; i.e., each point of the space is in some member of the collection. A space is defined as being compact if from each such collection of open sets, a finite number of these sets can be chosen that also cover the space.
Formulation of this topological concept of compactness was motivated by the Heine-Borel theorem for Euclidean space, which states that compactness of a set is equivalent to the setâ€™s being closed and bounded.
In general topological spaces, there are no concepts of distance or boundedness; but there are some theorems concerning the property of being closed. In a Hausdorff space (i.e., a topological space in which every two points can be enclosed in nonoverlapping open sets) every compact subset is closed, and in a compact space every closed subset is also compact. Compact sets also have the Bolzano-Weierstrass property, which means that for every infinite subset there is at least one point around which the other points of the set accumulate. In Euclidean space, the converse is also true; that is, a set having the Bolzano-Weierstrass property is compact.
Continuous functions on a compact set have the important properties of possessing maximum and minimum values and being approximated to any desired precision by properly chosen polynomial series, Fourier series, or various other classes of functions as described by the Stone-Weierstrass approximation theorem.
