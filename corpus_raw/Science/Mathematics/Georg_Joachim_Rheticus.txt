Georg Joachim Rheticus,  Rheticus also spelled Rhäticus, or Rhetikus, original name Georg Joachim De Porris, or Von Lauchen,  (born Feb. 16, 1514, Feldkirch, Austria—died  Dec. 5, 1576, Kassa, Hung.), Austrian-born astronomer and mathematician who was among the first to adopt and spread the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus.
In 1536 Rheticus was appointed to a chair of mathematics and astronomy at the University of Wittenberg. Intrigued by the news of the Copernican theory that Earth revolves around the Sun, he went to Frauenburg (now Frombork, Pol.) in 1539, where he studied for two years with Copernicus. Rheticus published the first account of the new views in his De libris revolutionum…Nic. Copernici…narratio prima… (1540; “The First Account of the Book on the Revolutions by Nicolaus Copernicus”). He encouraged Copernicus to complete his great work and took it to Nürnberg for publication, though in 1542 he moved to Leipzig to take up a new appointment before it was actually printed.
From his stay at Wittenberg until his death, Rheticus also worked on his great treatise, which was completed and published after his death by his pupil Valentin Otto as Opus Palatinum de triangulis (1596; “The Palatine Work on Triangles”). The treatise contains tables of values for the trigonometric functions (of an arc or angle) computed in intervals of 10 seconds of arc and calculated to 10 decimal places.
