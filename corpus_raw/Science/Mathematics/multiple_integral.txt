Multiple integral,  In calculus, the integral of a function of more than one variable. As the integral of a function of one variable over an interval results in an area, the double integral of a function of two variables calculated over a region results in a volume. Functions of three variables have triple integrals, and so on. Like the single integral, such constructions are useful in calculating the net change in a function that results from changes in its input values.
