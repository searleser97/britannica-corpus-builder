Luigi Cremona,  (born December 7, 1830, Pavia, Lombardy—died June 10, 1903, Rome), Italian mathematician who was an originator of graphical statics, the use of graphical methods to study forces in equilibrium.
Following his appointment as professor of higher geometry at the University of Bologna in 1860, he published “Introduzione ad una teoria geometrica delle curve piane” (1862; “Introduction to a Geometrical Theory of the Plane Curve”), his first paper on transformations (rules that associate with every point in a space one or more points in the same space) in planes and in space. This paper, upon which his reputation mainly rests, proclaims him a member of the Steinerian, or synthetic, school of geometricians. The paper was followed by “Sulle trasformazioni geometriche delle figure piane” (1863; “On the Geometrical Transformations of the Plane Figure”), his most important work on transformations.
In 1866 Cremona was appointed professor of higher geometry and graphical statics at the polytechnical institute of Milan. During his tenure there his creative work was at its peak, and he produced such works as Le figure reciproche della statica grafica (1872; Graphycal Statics, 1890), Elementi di geometria proiettiva (1873; Elements of Projective Geometry, 1885), and Elementi di calcolo grafico (1874; “Elements of Graphic Calculus”). In 1873 he was appointed director of the newly established Polytechnic School of Engineering, Rome. The responsibilities of this position effectively ended his mathematical research. In 1877 he attained the chair of higher mathematics at the University of Rome, and in 1879 he became a corresponding member of the Royal Society of London and a senator of the Kingdom of Italy.
