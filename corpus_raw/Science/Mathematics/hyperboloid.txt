Hyperboloid,  the open surface generated by revolving a hyperbola about either of its axes. If the tranverse axis of the surface lies along the x axis and its centre lies at the origin and if a, b, and c are the principal semi-axes, then the general equation of the surface is expressed as x2/a2 ± y2/b2 − z2/c2 = 1.
Revolution of the hyperbola about its conjugate axis generates a surface of one sheet, an hourglass-like shape (see figure, left), for which the second term of the above equation is positive. The intersections of the surface with planes parallel to the xz and yz planes are hyperbolas. Intersections with planes parallel to the xy plane are circles or ellipses.
Revolution of the hyperbola about its transverse axis generates a surface of two sheets, two separate surfaces (see figure, right), for which the second term of the general equation is negative. Intersections of the surface(s) with planes parallel to the xy and xz planes produce hyperbolas. Cutting planes parallel to the yz plane and at a distance greater than the absolute value of a,|a|, from the origin produce circles or ellipses of intersection, respectively, as a equals b or a is not equal to b.
