Richard Dagobert Brauer,  (born Feb. 10, 1901, Berlin, Ger.—died April 17, 1977, Belmont, Mass., U.S.), German-born American mathematician and educator, a pioneer in the development of modern algebra.
Brauer graduated from the University of Königsberg and received his Ph.D. in 1925 from the University of Berlin. He accepted a teaching position at Königsberg and remained there until 1933, when all Jews were dismissed from their academic posts in Germany. He immediately obtained a position in the United States at the University of Kentucky, and the following year he left to work with Hermann Weyl at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey. Their work later had a bearing on Nobel laureate Paul Dirac’s theory of the spinning electron. Brauer then became interested in the work of Georg Frobenius, who had introduced group characters in 1896. Brauer carried forward Frobenius’s work and developed a theory of modular characters that gave new insights into the study of group characters and advanced the development of algebra.
In 1935 he accepted a position at the University of Toronto and remained there until 1948, when he left to join the faculty at the University of Michigan. He became a professor in Harvard University’s mathematics department in 1952 and remained there until his retirement in 1971. He was chairman of the department from 1959 to 1963. In the late 1950s he began formulating a method for classifying finite simple groups, a task that absorbed his attention for the rest of his life. In 1970 Brauer was awarded the National Medal of Science.
His Collected Papers was published in 1980.
