Abū al-Wafāʾ, also spelled Abul Wefa, in full Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ismāʿīl ibn al-ʿAbbās Abū al-Wafāʾ al-Būzjānī,  (born June 10, 940, Buzjan, Iran—died 997 or July 998, Baghdad, Iraq), a distinguished Muslim astronomer and mathematician, who made important contributions to the development of trigonometry.
Abū al-Wafāʾ worked in a private observatory in Baghdad, where he made observations to determine, among other astronomical parameters, the obliquity of the ecliptic, the length of the seasons, and the latitude of the city. He also worked with astronomers in Khwārezm (now in Uzbekistan) to determine the difference in longitude between the two localities by means of the simultaneous observation of a lunar eclipse. He did not, as is sometimes claimed, discover the inequality in the Moon’s motion later called variation, but in his work on astronomy he utilized all six trigonometric functions and calculated tables for them. He discovered a new method for calculating the sine of 1/2° correct to the equivalent of eight decimal places, and he anticipated modern usage by suggesting the circle of unit radius for defining trigonometric functions. He simplified ancient methods of spherical trigonometry and proved the law of sines for general spherical triangles.
He translated and wrote commentaries, since lost, on the works of the Greek mathematicians Euclid and Diophantus of Alexandria and the Arabic mathematician al-Khwārizmī. Abū al-Wafāʾ also wrote two (extant) works aimed at the practical user, Kitāb fī mā yaḥtaj ilayhi al-kuttāb waʾl-ʿummāl min ʿilm al-ḥisāb (“Book on What Is Necessary from the Science of Arithmetic for Scribes and Businessmen”) and Kitāb fī mā yaḥtaj ilayhi al-ṣāniʿ min al-aʿmāl al-handasiyya (“Book on What Is Necessary from Geometric Constructions for the Artisan”).
In honor of his astronomical work, a crater on the Moon was named for him.
