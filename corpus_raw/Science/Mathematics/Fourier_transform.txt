Fourier transform,  in mathematics, a particular integral transform. As a transform of an integrable complex-valued function f of one real variable, it is the complex-valued function f Ë† of a real variable defined by the following equation
In the integral equation 
the function f (y) is an integral transform of F(x), and K(x,y) is the kernel. Often the reciprocal relationship is valid:
