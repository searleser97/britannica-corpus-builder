Shripati,  (flourished c. 1045, Rohinikhanda, India), Indian astronomer-astrologer and mathematician whose astrological writings were particularly influential.
Shripati wrote various works in the first two of the three branches of astral science (jyotihshastra)—namely, mathematics (including astronomy), horoscopic astrology, and natural astrology (divination). For the first branch, he wrote Ganitatilaka (“The Ornament of Mathematics”) and the astronomical works Siddhantashekhara (“The Crest of Established Doctrines”), Dhikotidakarana (“Procedure Giving Intellectual Climax”), and Dhruvamanasa (“Permanent Mind”). Siddhantashekhara is modeled on Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta, a work by Brahmagupta (598–c. 665), and includes two chapters on mathematics; as one of the few surviving documents from this period, it sheds important light on the state of Indian algebra between Brahmagupta and Bhaskara II (1114–c. 1185).
For horoscopic astrology, Shripati wrote Jatakakarmapaddhati (“Way to the Computation of Nativity”), Jyotisharatnamala (“A Jewel Necklace of Astral Science”), and possibly Daivajnavallabha (“A Lover of Fortune-Tellers”). Jyotisharatnamala was modeled on Jyotisharatnakosha, an astrological work by the 8th-century Indian astronomer-astrologer Lalla. The two works ascribed with certainty to Shripati were highly influential on the development of astrology in India, and many commentaries were written on them.
