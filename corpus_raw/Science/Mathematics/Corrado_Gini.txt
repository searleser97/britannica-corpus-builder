Corrado Gini,  (born May 23, 1884, Motta di Livenza, Treviso, Italy—died  Mar. 13, 1965, Rome), Italian statistician and demographer.
Gini was educated at Bologna, where he studied law, mathematics, economics, and biology. He was a statistics professor at Cagliari in 1909 and at Padua in 1913. After founding the statistical journal Metron (1920), Gini became a professor at the University of Rome (1925). At Rome he pioneered in the teaching of sociology, treating the subject as a study of populations and their measurable characteristics, drawing on biological concepts for his view of social development. His statistical studies began with the relationship of probability to population statistics—e.g., determining the sex ratio at birth.
Demography remained one of Gini’s chief interests, and he later advanced a cyclical theory of population. He developed the theory of dispersion in Variabilità e Mutabilità (1912) and the concentration ratio. This led to his most famous contribution, the Gini coefficient, which is used in a mathematical formula to determine the measure of dispersion in a concentration.
