Fermat prime,  prime number of the form 22n + 1, for some positive integer n. For example, 223 + 1 = 28 + 1 = 257 is a Fermat prime. On the basis of his knowledge that numbers of this form are prime for values of n from 1 through 4, the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601–65) conjectured that all numbers of this form are prime. However, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707–83) showed that Fermat’s conjecture is false for n = 5: 225 + 1 = 232 + 1 = 4,294,967,297, which is divisible by 641. In fact, it is known that numbers of this form are not prime for values of n from 5 through 30, placing doubt on the existence of any Fermat primes for values of n > 4.
