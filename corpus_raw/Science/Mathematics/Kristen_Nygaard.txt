Kristen Nygaard,  (born Aug. 27, 1926, Oslo, Nor.—died Aug. 10, 2002, Oslo), Norwegian mathematician and computer scientist who invented, with his coworker Ole-Johan Dahl, the computer programming language SIMULA, which used modules of data, called “objects,” to process data more efficiently than was possible with previous complex software instructions.
SIMULA, which the pair developed while working at the Norwegian Computing Centre (NCC) in the 1960s, provided a foundation for all other object-oriented programming, including computer languages such as C++ and Java and graphical user interfaces such as Apple Inc.’s Mac OS and Microsoft Corporation’s Windows OS.
Nygaard was on the staff of the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment (1948–60) before joining the NCC and later taught at the University of Oslo (1976–96), where Dahl was a professor of informatics (computer science) from 1968. In 1990 Nygaard won the Norbert Weiner Prize for his contributions to the “Scandinavian School” of participatory technical design. He was also active in the leftist Venstre political party and in the early 1990s led the opposition to Norway’s entry into the European Union.
Nygaard and Dahl were both created Commanders of the Order of St. Olav in 2000, and they shared both the 2001 A.M. Turing Award, the computing field’s highest honour, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 2002 John von Neumann Medal.
