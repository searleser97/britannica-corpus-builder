Hypothesis testing,  In statistics, a method for testing how accurately a mathematical model based on one set of data predicts the nature of other data sets generated by the same process. Hypothesis testing grew out of quality control, in which whole batches of manufactured items are accepted or rejected based on testing relatively small samples. An initial hypothesis (null hypothesis) might predict, for example, that the widths of a precision part manufactured in batches will conform to a normal distribution with a given mean (see mean, median, and mode). Samples from new batches either confirm or disprove this hypothesis, which is refined based on these results.
