Gerd Faltings,  (born July 28, 1954, Gelsenkirchen, West Germany), German mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1986 for his work in algebraic geometry.
Faltings attended the Westphalian Wilhelm University of Münster (Ph.D., 1978). Following a visiting research fellowship at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. (1978–79), he held appointments at Münster (1979–82), the University of Wuppertal (1982–84), Princeton University in New Jersey (1985–96), and, from 1994, the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn (see Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science).
Faltings was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berkeley, California, U.S., in 1986, primarily for his proof of the Mordell conjecture. In 1922 Louis Mordell had conjectured that a system of algebraic equations with rational coefficients that defines an algebraic curve of genus greater than or equal to two (a surface with two or more “holes”) has only a finite number of rational solutions that have no common factors. By proving this, Faltings showed that xn + yn = zn could have only a finite number of solutions in integers for n > 2, which was a major breakthrough in proving Fermat’s last theorem that this equation has no natural number solutions for n > 2. It is a major example of the power of the new unified theories of arithmetic and algebraic geometry.
Faltings’s publications include Rational Points (1984); with Ching-Li Chai, Degeneration of Abelian Varieties (1990); and Lectures on the Arithmetic Riemann-Roch Theorem (1992).
