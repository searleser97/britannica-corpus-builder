Perfect number,  a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. The smallest perfect number is 6, which is the sum of 1, 2, and 3. Other perfect numbers are 28, 496, and 8,128. The discovery of such numbers is lost in prehistory. It is known, however, that the Pythagoreans (founded c. 525 bce) studied perfect numbers for their “mystical” properties.
The mystical tradition was continued by the Neo-Pythagorean philosopher Nicomachus of Gerasa (fl. c. 100 ce), who classified numbers as deficient, perfect, and superabundant according to whether the sum of their divisors was less than, equal to, or greater than the number, respectively. Nicomachus gave moral qualities to his definitions, and such ideas found credence among early Christian theologians. Often the 28-day cycle of the Moon around the Earth was given as an example of a “Heavenly,” hence perfect, event that naturally was a perfect number. The most famous example of such thinking is given by St. Augustine, who wrote in The City of God (413–426):
The earliest extant mathematical result concerning perfect numbers occurs in Euclid’s Elements (c. 300 bce), where he proves the proposition:
Here “double proportion” means that each number is twice the preceding number, as in 1, 2, 4, 8, …. For example, 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 is prime; therefore, 7 × 4 = 28 (“the sum multiplied into the last”) is a perfect number. Euclid’s formula forces any perfect number obtained from it to be even, and in the 18th century the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler showed that any even perfect number must be obtainable from Euclid’s formula. It is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers.
