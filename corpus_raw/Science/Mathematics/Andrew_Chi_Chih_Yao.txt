Andrew Chi-Chih Yao,  (born Dec. 24, 1946, Shanghai, China), Chinese American computer scientist and winner of the 2000 A.M. Turing Award, the highest honour in computer science, for his “fundamental contributions to the theory of computation [computational complexity], including the complexity-based theory of pseudorandom number generation, cryptography, and communication complexity.” In addition to the fields cited in the Turing Award, which have important applications in distributed computing, Yao contributed fundamental research in the analysis of algorithms and quantum computing.
Yao received a bachelor’s degree (1967) in physics from the National Taiwan University, a master’s degree (1969) in physics and a doctorate (1972) in physics from Harvard University, and a doctorate (1975) in computer science from the University of Illinois. After finishing his studies, Yao taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1975–76), Stanford University (1976–81; 1982–86), the University of California, Berkeley (1981–82), Princeton University (1986–2004), Tsinghua University, Beijing (2004– ), where he is the director of the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (2005– ).
Yao was the managing editor of the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Journal on Computing (1989–91), the advisory editor of the Journal of Combinatorial Optimization (1997– ), and the associate editor in chief of the Journal of Software (2001– ). He served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Algorithms (1980–91), the SIAM Journal on Computing (1981–87), the Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery (1982–83), Information and Control (1982–85), Algorithmica (1985), Random Structures & Algorithms (1990–2002), the Journal of Cryptology (1991–96), and the International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science (1994– ).
Yao was elected to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM; 1995), the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1998), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2000), the Academia Sinica (2000), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2003), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2004). In addition to the Turing Award, Yao received the SIAM George Pólya Prize (1987), the ACM Donald E. Knuth Prize (1996), and the Pan Wen-Yuan Foundation Research Award (2003).
