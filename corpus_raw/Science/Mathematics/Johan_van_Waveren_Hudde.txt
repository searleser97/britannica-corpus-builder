Johan van Waveren Hudde,  (born April 23, 1628, Amsterdam, Neth.—died  April 15, 1704, Amsterdam), Dutch mathematician and statesman who promoted Cartesian geometry and philosophy in Holland and contributed to the theory of equations.
Born of a patrician family, Hudde served for some 30 years as burgomaster of Amsterdam. In his De reductione aequationum (1713; “Concerning Reduction of Equations”), he was the first to take literal coefficients in algebra as indifferently positive or negative. Two of his discoveries, dating from 1657 to 1658, are known as Hudde’s rules and point clearly toward algorithms (a special process for solving certain types of problems) of calculus. Hudde also anticipated the power-series expansion (1656) for ln (1 + x) and the use of space coordinates (1657). In 1672 he directed the flooding of parts of Holland to block the advancing French army during the War of 1672–78. He corresponded with the Dutch mathematician and physicist Christiaan Huygens on problems of canal maintenance, probability, and life expectancy. Although Hudde’s manuscripts were never published, Gottfried Leibniz of Germany reported that they contained many excellent results.
