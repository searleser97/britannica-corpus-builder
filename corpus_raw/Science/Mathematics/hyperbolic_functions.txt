Hyperbolic functions, also called hyperbolic trigonometric functions,  the hyperbolic sine of z (written sinh z); the hyperbolic cosine of z (cosh z); the hyperbolic tangent of z (tanh z); and the hyperbolic cosecant, secant, and cotangent of z. These functions are most conveniently defined in terms of the exponential function, with sinh z = 1/2(ez − e−z) and cosh z = 1/2(ez + e−z) and with the other hyperbolic trigonometric functions defined in a manner analogous to ordinary trigonometry.
Just as the ordinary sine and cosine functions trace (or parameterize) a circle, so the sinh and cosh parameterize a hyperbola—hence the hyperbolic appellation. Hyperbolic functions also satisfy identities analogous to those of the ordinary trigonometric functions and have important physical applications. For example, the hyperbolic cosine function may be used to describe the shape of the curve formed by a high-voltage line suspended between two towers (see catenary). Hyperbolic functions may also be used to define a measure of distance in certain kinds of non-Euclidean geometry.
