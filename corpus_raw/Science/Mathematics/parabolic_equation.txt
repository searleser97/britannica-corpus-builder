Parabolic equation,  any of a class of partial differential equations arising in the mathematical analysis of diffusion phenomena, as in the heating of a slab. The simplest such equation in one dimension, uxx = ut, governs the temperature distribution at the various points along a thin rod from moment to moment. The solutions to even this simple problem are complicated, but they are constructed largely from a function called the fundamental solution of the equation, given by an exponential function, exp [(−x2/4t)/t1/2]. To determine the complete solution to this type of problem, the initial temperature distribution along the rod and the manner in which the temperature at the ends of the rod is changing must also be known. These additional conditions are called initial values and boundary values, respectively, and together are sometimes called auxiliary conditions.
In the analogous two- and three-dimensional problems, the initial temperature distribution throughout the region must be known, as well as the temperature distribution along the boundary from moment to moment. The differential equation in two dimensions is, in the simplest case, 
uxx + uyy = ut,
with an additional uzz term added for the three-dimensional case. These equations are appropriate only if the medium is of uniform composition throughout, while, for problems of nonuniform composition or for some other diffusion-type problems, more complicated equations may arise. These equations are also called parabolic in the given region if they can be written in the simpler form described above by using a different coordinate system. An equation in one dimension the higher-order terms of which are 
auxx + buxt + cutt
can be so transformed if b2 − 4ac = 0. If the coefficients a, b, c depend on the values of x, the equation will be parabolic in a region if b2 − 4ac = 0 at each point of the region.
