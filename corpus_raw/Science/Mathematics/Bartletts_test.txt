Bartlett’s test, in full Bartlett’s test for homogeneity of variance,  in statistics, a test to ascertain if multiple samples have the same variance (the square of the sample’s standard deviation). The test, which is a standard tool in analysis of variance (ANOVA) computer programs, can be used when a single measurable variable is involved, such as when testing the efficacy of a new drug. The test was introduced by the English statistician Maurice Stevenson Bartlett in 1937.
