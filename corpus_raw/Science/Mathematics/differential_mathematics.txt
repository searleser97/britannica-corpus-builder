Differential,  in mathematics, an expression based on the derivative of a function, useful for approximating certain values of the function. The derivative of a function at the point x0, written as f′(x0), is defined as the limit as Δx approaches 0 of the quotient Δy/Δx, in which Δy is f(x0 + Δx) − f(x0). Because the derivative is defined as the limit, the closer Δx is to 0, the closer will be the quotient to the derivative. Therefore, if Δx is small, then Δy ≈ f′(x0)Δx (the wavy lines mean “is approximately equal to”). For example, to approximate f(17) for f(x) = Square root of√x, first note that its derivative f′(x) is equal to (x−1/2)/2. Choosing a computationally convenient value for x0, in this case the perfect square 16, results in a simple calculation of f′(x0) as 1/8 and Δx as 1, giving an approximate value of 1/8 for Δy. Because f(16) is 4, it follows that f(17), or Square root of√17, is approximately 4.125, the actual value being 4.123 to three decimal places.
