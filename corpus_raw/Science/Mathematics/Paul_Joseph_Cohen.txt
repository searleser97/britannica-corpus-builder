Paul Joseph Cohen,  (born April 2, 1934, Long Branch, N.J., U.S.—died March 23, 2007, Stanford, Calif.), American mathematician, who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 for his proof of the independence of the continuum hypothesis from the other axioms of set theory.
Cohen attended the University of Chicago (M.S., 1954; Ph.D., 1958). He held appointments at the University of Rochester, N.Y. (1957–58), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1958–59) before joining the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J. (1959–61). In 1961 he moved to Stanford University in California; he became professor emeritus in 2004.
Cohen was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Moscow in 1966. Cohen solved a problem (first on David Hilbert’s influential 1900 list of important unsolved problems) concerning the truth of the continuum hypothesis. Georg Cantor’s continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between ℵ0 and 2ℵ0. In 1940 Kurt Gödel had shown that, if one accepts the Zermelo-Fraenkel system of axioms for set theory, then the continuum hypothesis is not disprovable. Cohen, in 1963, showed that it is not provable under these hypotheses and hence is independent of the other axioms. To do this he introduced a new technique known as forcing, a technique that has since had significant applications throughout set theory. The question still remains whether, with some axiom system for set theory, the continuum hypothesis is true. Alonzo Church, in his comments to the Congress in Moscow, suggested that the “Gödel-Cohen results and subsequent extensions of them have the consequence that there is not one set theory but many, with the difference arising in connection with a problem which intuition still seems to tell us must ‘really’ have only one true solution.” After proving his startling result about the continuum hypothesis, Cohen returned to research in analysis.
Cohen’s publications include Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis (1966).
