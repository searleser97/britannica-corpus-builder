Pierre Deligne, in full Pierre René Deligne,  (born October 3, 1944, Brussels, Belgium), Belgian mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal (1978), the Crafoord Prize (1988), and the Abel Prize (2013) for his work in algebraic geometry.
Deligne received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics (1966) and a doctorate (1968) from the Free University of Brussels. After a year at the National Foundation for Scientific Research, Brussels, he joined the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies, Bures-sur-Yvette, France, in 1968. In 1984 he became a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.; he became professor emeritus in 2008.
In 1949 the French mathematician André Weil made a series of conjectures concerning zeta functions of curves of abelian varieties. One of these was the equivalent of the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields. Deligne used a new theory of cohomology called étale cohomology, drawing on ideas originally developed by Alexandre Grothendieck some 15 years earlier, and applied them to solve the deepest of the Weil conjectures. Deligne’s work provided important insights into the relationship between algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. He also developed an area of mathematics called weight theory, which has applications in the solution of differential equations.
Deligne’s publications included Équations différentielles à points singuliers réguliers (1970; “Differential Equations with Regular Singular Points”); Groupes de monodromie en géométrie algébrique (1973; “Monodromy Groups in Algebraic Geometry”); Modular Functions of One Variable (1973); with Jean-Franƈois Boutot et al., Cohomologie étale (1977; “ Étale Cohomologies”); and, with J. Milne, A. Ogus, and K. Shih, Hodge Cycles, Motives, and Shimura Varieties (1982).
