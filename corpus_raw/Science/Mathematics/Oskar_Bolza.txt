Oskar Bolza,  (born May 12, 1857, Bergzabern, Rhenish Palatinate [Germany]—died  July 5, 1942, Freiburg im Breisgau, Ger.), German mathematician and educator who was particularly noted for his work on the reduction of hyperelliptic to elliptic integrals and for his original contributions to the calculus of variations.
Bolza studied at the University of Berlin and received his doctoral degree in 1886 at the University of Göttingen. He accepted a minor position at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md., in 1889 and within a year was appointed associate in mathematics at Clark University, Worcester, Mass. In 1893 Bolza joined the department of mathematics at the newly established University of Chicago. In 1910 he returned to Germany as honorary professor of mathematics at the University of Freiburg, where he remained until his death.
Bolza lectured extensively in both the United States and Europe on the calculus of variations and, in 1904, published a treatise, Lectures on the Calculus of Variations (revised and translated by him into German as Vorlesungen über Variationsrechnung, 1908), which became a classic in the field. Several of his papers published in 1913 and 1914 developed an original variational problem known as the problem of Bolza, which combines the earlier problems of J.-L. Lagrange and C.G.A. Mayer into a generalized statement. Bolza’s later lectures on his function theory and integral equations were collected by William V. Lovitt and published in 1924 as Linear Integral Equations.
