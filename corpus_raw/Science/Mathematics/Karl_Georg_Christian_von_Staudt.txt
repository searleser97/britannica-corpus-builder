Karl Georg Christian von Staudt,  (born Jan. 24, 1798, Imperial Free City of Rothenburg [now Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany]—died June 1, 1867, Erlangen, Bavaria), German mathematician who developed the first purely synthetic theory of imaginary points, lines, and planes in projective geometry. Later geometers, especially Felix Klein (1849–1925), Moritz Pasch (1843–1930), and David Hilbert (1862–1943), exploited these possibilities for bridging the gap between synthetic and analytic methods in geometry.
Staudt studied mathematics and astronomy under Carl Gauss from 1818 to 1822 at the University of Göttingen. Under Gauss’s supervision he published research on ephemerides and the orbits of asteroids. After taking his doctorate at the University of Erlangen in 1822, Staudt taught mathematics at the Gymnasium in Nuremberg from 1827 to 1835. From 1835 until his death he was professor of mathematics at the University of Erlangen.
Although Staudt’s principal fame was due to his contributions to the geometry of position (now known as projective geometry), he also worked on the arithmetical properties of Bernoulli numbers and on the Von Staudt–Clausen theorem. His main works were Geometrie der Lage (1847; “The Geometry of Position”) and Beiträge zur Geometrie der Lage (1856–60; “Contributions to the Geometry of Position”).
