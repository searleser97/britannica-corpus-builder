Sir Michael Francis Atiyah,  (born April 22, 1929, London, England—died January 11, 2019), British mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 primarily for his work in topology. Atiyah received a knighthood in 1983 and the Order of Merit in 1992. He also served as president of the Royal Society (1990–95).
Atiyah’s father was Lebanese and his mother Scottish. He attended Victoria College in Egypt and Trinity College, Cambridge (Ph.D., 1955). He held appointments at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S. (1955), and at the University of Cambridge (1956–61). In 1961 Atiyah moved to the University of Oxford, where from 1963 to 1969 he held the Savilian Chair of Geometry. He returned to the Institute in 1969 before becoming the Royal Society Research Professor at Oxford in 1972. In 1990 Atiyah became master of Trinity College and director of the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences, both at Cambridge; he retired from the latter position in 1996.
Atiyah was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Moscow in 1966 for his work on topology and analysis. He was one of the pioneers, along with the Frenchman Alexandre Grothendieck and the German Friedrich Hirzebruch, in the development of K-theory—culminating in 1963, in collaboration with the American Isadore Singer, in the famous Atiyah-Singer index theorem, which characterizes the number of solutions for an elliptic differential equation. (Atiyah and Singer were jointly recognized for this work with the 2004 Abel Prize.) His early work in topology and algebra was followed by work in a number of different fields, a phenomenon regularly observed in Fields medalists. He contributed, along with others, to the development of the theory of complex manifolds—i.e., generalizations of Riemann surfaces to several variables. He also worked on algebraic topology, algebraic varieties, complex analysis, the Yang-Mills equations and gauge theory, and superstring theory in mathematical physics.
Atiyah’s publications include K-theory (1967); with I.G. Macdonald, Introduction to Commutative Algebra (1969); Elliptic Operators and Compact Groups (1974); Geometry of Yang-Mills Fields (1979); with Nigel Hitchin, The Geometry and Dynamics of Magnetic Monopoles (1988); and The Geometry and Physics of Knots (1990). His Collected Works, in five volumes, appeared in 1988.
