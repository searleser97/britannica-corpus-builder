Andrew Russell Forsyth,  (born June 18, 1858, Glasgow, Scot.—died June 2, 1942, London, Eng.), British mathematician, best known for his mathematical textbooks.
In 1877 Forsyth entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics under Arthur Cayley. Forsyth graduated in 1881 as first wrangler (first place in the annual Mathematical Tripos contest) and was given a fellowship at Trinity. The following year he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the University of Liverpool. He returned to Cambridge in 1884 to accept a lectureship, and in 1886 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1895, following the death of Cayley, Forsyth was appointed to the vacant position of Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics at Cambridge. A scandal with a married woman, whom he subsequently married, forced Forsyth to resign his position in 1910. The new couple relocated to India until 1913, when Forsyth obtained a position in London at Imperial College, where he remained until he retired in 1923.
Forsyth’s most important and influential publication was Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable (1893), which introduced modern mathematical approaches from the rest of Europe to his British audience. Forsyth’s other publications include A Treatise on Differential Equations (1885), the six volumes of Theory of Differential Equations (1890–1906), Lectures on the Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces (1912), Calculus of Variations (1927), and Geometry of Four Dimensions (1930). One of Forsyth’s essays, “Mathematics, in Life and Thought,” is included in Encyclopædia Britannica’s Gateway to the Great Books (1963).
