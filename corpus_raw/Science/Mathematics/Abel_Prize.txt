Abel Prize,  award granted annually for research in mathematics, in commemoration of the brilliant 19th-century Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel. The Niels Henrik Abel Memorial Fund was established on Jan. 1, 2002, and it is administered by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research. The main purpose of the fund is to award an international prize for “outstanding scientific work in the field of mathematics.” The prize is also intended to help raise the status of mathematics in society and to stimulate the interest of young people in mathematics. Responsibility for the Abel Prize and for other uses of the funds lies with the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. The fund also supports one or two Abel Symposia per year on various branches of mathematics, and in 2005 the fund created the Bernt Michael Holmboe Memorial Prize for the promotion of excellence in teaching mathematics, in honour of Abel’s own mathematics teacher.
As the 100th anniversary of Abel’s birth approached in 1902, plans for creating a prize in Abel’s name had been promoted by the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, but he died in 1899, and the impetus faded with him. It was revived in 1902 by King Oscar II, who organized many prizes during his reign, including one in the 1880s on celestial mechanics that was won by the French mathematician Henri Poincaré. The demise of the union between Sweden and Norway, and the resulting loss of revenue, ended efforts to establish an annual mathematics prize. Abel’s status in Norway remained high, though, and, when plans for a prize were revived in 2000—which the International Mathematical Union had designated the World Mathematical Year—they met with widespread acceptance. The prize, which is worth about $1 million, was first awarded in 2003 to the French mathematician Jean-Pierre Serre.
The winners of the Abel Prize are listed chronologically below.
