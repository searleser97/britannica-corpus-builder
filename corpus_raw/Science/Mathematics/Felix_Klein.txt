Felix Klein, in full Christian Felix Klein,  (born April 25, 1849, Düsseldorf, Prussia [Germany]—died June 22, 1925, Göttingen, Germany), German mathematician whose unified view of geometry as the study of the properties of a space that are invariant under a given group of transformations, known as the Erlanger Programm, profoundly influenced mathematical developments.
As a student at the University of Bonn (Ph.D., 1868), Klein worked closely with the physicist and geometer Julius Plücker (1801–68). After Plücker’s death, he worked with the geometer Alfred Clebsch (1833–72), who headed the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen. On Clebsch’s recommendation, Klein was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Erlangen (1872–75), where he set forth the views contained in his Erlanger Programm. These ideas reflected his close collaboration with the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, whom he met in Berlin in 1869. Before the outbreak of the Franco-German War in July 1870, they were together in Paris developing their early ideas on the role of transformation groups in geometry and on the theory of differential equations.
Klein later taught at the Institute of Technology in Munich (1875–80) and then at the Universities of Leipzig (1880–86) and Göttingen (1886–1913). From 1874 he was the editor of Mathematische Annalen (“Annals of Mathematics”), one of the world’s leading mathematics journals, and from 1895 he supervised the great Encyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss iher Anwendungen (“Encyclopedia of Pure and Applied Mathematics”). His works on elementary mathematics, including Elementarmathematik vom höheren Standpunkte aus (1908; “Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint”), reached a wide public. His technical papers were collected in Gesammelte Mathematische Abhandlungen, 3 vol., (1921–23; “Collected Mathematical Treatises”).
Beyond his own work Klein made his greatest impact on mathematics as the principal architect of the modern community of mathematicians at Göttingen, which emerged as one of the world’s leading research centres under Klein and David Hilbert (1862–1943) during the period from 1900 to 1914. After Klein’s retirement Richard Courant (1888–1972) gradually assumed Klein’s role as the organizational leader of this still vibrant community.
