Constantin Carathéodory,  (born September 13, 1873, Berlin, Germany—died February 2, 1950, Munich), German mathematician of Greek origin who made important contributions to the theory of real functions, to the calculus of variations, and to the theory of point-set measure.
After two years as an assistant engineer with the British Asyūṭ Dam project in Egypt, Carathéodory began his study of mathematics at the University of Berlin in 1900. In 1902 he entered the University of Göttingen, where he received a Ph.D. (1904) under the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski. After teaching at the Universities of Hannover (1909), Breslau (1910–13), Göttingen (1913–18), and Berlin (1918–20), he accepted a post at the University of Smyrna, which the Greeks were setting up in Anatolia. When the Turks razed Smyrna in 1922, Carathéodory managed to save the university library, which he moved to the University of Athens, where he taught until 1924. He then was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Munich.
Carathéodory’s contributions to the calculus of variations included a comprehensive theory of discontinuous solutions, in which previously there had been only limited findings. He also added important results to the relationship between first-order partial differential equations and the calculus of variations. His work on the problems of variation of m-dimensional surfaces in an n-dimensional space marked the first far-reaching results for the general case. He contributed important findings to the theory of the functions of several variables and simplified the proof of the main theorem of conformal representation of simply connected regions on the unit-radius circle. His investigations of the geometrical-set theoretic properties of boundaries resulted in his theory of boundary correspondence. He also contributed to thermodynamics.
His published works included Vorlesungen über reelle Funktionen (1918; “Treatise on Real Functions”), Conformal Representation (1932), Geometrische Optik (1937; “Geometrical Optics”), Reelle Funktionen (1939; “Real Functions”), and Funktionentheorie, 2 vol. (1950; “Function Theory”).
