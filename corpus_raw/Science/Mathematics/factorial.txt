Factorial,  in mathematics, the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer and denoted by that integer and an exclamation point. Thus, factorial seven is written 7!, meaning 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7. Factorial zero is defined as equal to 1.
Factorials are commonly encountered in the evaluation of permutations and combinations and in the coefficients of terms of binomial expansions (see binomial theorem). Factorials have been generalized to include nonintegral values (see gamma function).
