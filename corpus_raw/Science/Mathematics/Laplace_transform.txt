Laplace transform,  in mathematics, a particular integral transform invented by the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827), and systematically developed by the British physicist Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925), to simplify the solution of many differential equations that describe physical processes. Today it is used most frequently by electrical engineers in the solution of various electronic circuit problems.
The Laplace transform f(p), also denoted by L{F(t)} or Lap F(t), is defined by the integralinvolving the exponential parameter p in the kernel K = e−pt. The linear Laplace operator L thus transforms each function F(t) of a certain set of functions into some function f(p). The inverse transform F(t) is written L−1{f(p)} or Lap−1f(p).
