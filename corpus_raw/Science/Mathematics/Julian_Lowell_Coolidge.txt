Julian Lowell Coolidge,  (born Sept. 28, 1873, Brookline, Mass., U.S.—died  March 5, 1954, Cambridge, Mass.), U.S. mathematician and educator who published numerous works on theoretical mathematics along the lines of the Study-Segre school.
Coolidge was born to a family of well-established Bostonians; his paternal grandmother was Thomas Jefferson’s granddaughter. Following the family tradition, Coolidge attended Exeter Academy and then Harvard College where, in 1895, he graduated summa cum laude. He next enrolled at Oxford and in 1897 received the first B.Sc. ever awarded by that university. For two years he taught mathematics at the Groton School before joining the mathematics department at Harvard in 1899 as an instructor. After a brief leave of absence to obtain his Ph.D. from the University of Bonn (1904), he returned to Harvard to continue his teaching; he became assistant professor in 1908 and professor in 1918. For the next four decades Coolidge was associated with the faculty at Harvard. He was appointed department chairman in 1927 and worked closely with Harvard’s president, A. Lawrence Lowell, in the latter’s reforms. In 1930 Coolidge and his family moved into Lowell House, where, for the next 10 years, he served as house master.
Coolidge’s works include The Elements of Non-Euclidean Geometry (1909), A Treatise on the Circle and the Sphere (1916), The Geometry of the Complex Domain (1924), An Introduction to Mathematical Probability (1925), A Treatise on Algebraic Plane Curves (1931), A History of Geometrical Methods (1940), A History of the Conic Sections and Quadric Surfaces (1945), and The Mathematics of Great Amateurs (1949).
