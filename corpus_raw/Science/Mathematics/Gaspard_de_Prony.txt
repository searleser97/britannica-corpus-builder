Gaspard de Prony, in full Gaspard-Clair-François-Marie Riche, baron de Prony,  (born July 22, 1755, Chamelet, France—died July 29, 1839, Paris), French mathematician and engineer. He invented the Prony brake (1821), a device for measuring the power developed by an engine. In the Prony brake, brake blocks are squeezed against a rotating wheel, and the friction generated at the ends of the wheel applies torque to a lever; a scale measures the force needed to hold the lever in place.
