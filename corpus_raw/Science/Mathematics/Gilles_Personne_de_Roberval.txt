Gilles Personne de Roberval,  Personne also spelled Personier,  (born Aug. 8, 1602, Roberval, France—died  Oct. 27, 1675, Paris), French mathematician who made important advances in the geometry of curves.
In 1632 Roberval became professor of mathematics at the Collège de France, Paris, a position he held until his death. He studied the methods of determination of surface area and volume of solids, developing and improving the method of indivisibles used by the Italian mathematician Bonaventura Cavalieri for computing some of the simpler cases. He discovered a general method of drawing tangents, by treating a curve as the result of the motion of a moving point and by resolving the motion of the point into two simpler components. He also discovered a method for obtaining one curve from another, by means of which planar regions of finite dimensions can be found that are equal in area to the regions between certain curves and their asymptotes (lines that the curves approach but never intersect). To these curves, which were also used to determine areas, the Italian mathematician Evangelista Torricelli gave the name of Robervallian lines.
Roberval indulged in scientific feuds with several of his contemporaries, among them the French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes. He also invented the balance known by his name (see Roberval balance).
