Fermat’s theorem, also known as Fermat’s little theorem and Fermat’s primality test,  in number theory, the statement, first given in 1640 by French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, that for any prime number p and any integer a such that p does not divide a (the pair are relatively prime), p divides exactly into ap − a. Although a number n that does not divide exactly into an − a for some a must be a composite number, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, let a = 2 and n = 341, then a and n are relatively prime and 341 divides exactly into 2341 − 2. However, 341 = 11 × 31, so it is a composite number (a special type of composite number known as a pseudoprime). Thus, Fermat’s theorem gives a test that is necessary but not sufficient for primality.
As with many of Fermat’s theorems, no proof by him is known to exist. The first known published proof of this theorem was by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1736, though a proof in an unpublished manuscript dating to about 1683 was given by German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. A special case of Fermat’s theorem, known as the Chinese hypothesis, may be some 2,000 years old. The Chinese hypothesis, which replaces a with 2, states that a number n is prime if and only if it divides exactly into 2n − 2. As proved later in the West, the Chinese hypothesis is only half right.
