René-Louis Baire,  (born January 21, 1874, Paris, France—died July 5, 1932, Chambéry), French mathematician whose study of irrational numbers and the concept of continuity of functions that approximate them greatly influenced the French school of mathematics.
The son of a tailor, Baire won a scholarship in 1886 that enabled him to attend better schools, and in 1891 he passed the entrance examinations for both the École Polytechnique and the École Normale Supérieure. Baire chose the latter institution and graduated with a B.S. in 1895 and a Ph.D. in 1899. His doctoral thesis on the theory of functions of real variables applied concepts from set theory to classify (“categorize”) functions—class 1 functions as the limit of a sequence of continuous functions, class 2 functions as the limit of a sequence of class 1 functions, class 3 functions as the limit of a sequence of class 3 functions. There is now an elaborate theory dealing with such questions, built around the notion of Baire categories.
In 1902 Baire joined the faculty at the University of Montpellier and three years later the faculty at the University of Dijon. Afflicted throughout his life by a frail constitution, Baire took a leave of absence in 1914 to recover his health at Lausanne, Switzerland, but found himself unable to return to France after World War I began. He officially retired in 1925. Among Baire’s most important works are Théorie des nombres irrationels, des limites et de la continuité (1905; “Theory of Irrational Numbers, Limits, and Continuity”) and Leçons sur les théories générales de l’analyse, 2 vol. (1907–08; “Lessons on the General Theory of Analysis”), which gave new impetus to the teaching of analysis.
