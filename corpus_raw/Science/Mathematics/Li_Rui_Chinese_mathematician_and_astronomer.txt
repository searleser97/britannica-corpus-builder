Li Rui,  (born January 15, 1769, Yuanhe [Suzhou], China—died August 12, 1817, Yuanhe), Chinese mathematician and astronomer who made notable contributions to the revival of traditional Chinese mathematics and astronomy and to the development of the theory of equations.
Having failed the Chinese civil service examinations several times, Li Rui could obtain no official position, and he had to make a poor living as an assistant to various mandarin scholar-officials. From about 1800 he began to study the works of the 13th-century mathematicians Li Ye and Qin Jiushao. From these works, he found that the traditional Chinese method of solving higher-degree equations had several advantages over algebraic methods that had recently been imported from the West. Stimulated by his contemporary Wang Lai, who had criticized ancient mathematicians for their satisfaction with obtaining only one positive rational solution of a given algebraic equation, Li Rui created his theory of equations to deal with the relationship between the number of solutions of an equation and the way that terms in the expression change signs. He explored this domain without any knowledge of René Descartes’s comparable work in the West; Li Rui based his research on traditional Chinese terminology and methods, thus demonstrating the continuing utility of Chinese methods.
Li Rui’s Kaifang shuo (1820; “On the Method of Extraction”) contains his work on the theory of equations: a rule of signs, a discussion of multiple roots and negative roots, and the rule that nonreal roots of an algebraic equation must exist in pairs. Most of his works were published as Lishi suanxue yishu (1819; “The Posthumous Works of Li Shangzhi”).
