Willebrord Snell, Latin-Dutch Willebrordus Snellius, original name Willebrord Snel van Royen,  (born 1580?, Leiden, Netherlands—died October 30, 1626, Leiden), astronomer and mathematician who discovered the law of refraction, which relates the degree of the bending of light to the properties of the refractive material. This law is basic to modern geometrical optics.
In 1613 he succeeded his father, Rudolph Snell (1546–1613), as professor of mathematics in the University of Leiden. His Eratosthenes Batavus (1617; “Batavian Eratosthenes”) contains the account of his method of measuring the Earth. The account of Snell’s law of refraction (1621) went unpublished, capturing attention only when the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens related Snell’s finding in Dioptrica (1703).
