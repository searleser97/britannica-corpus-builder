Lodovico Ferrari, also spelled Ludovico Ferraro,  (born Feb. 2, 1522, Bologna, Papal States [Italy]—died  Oct. 5, 1565, Bologna), Italian mathematician who was the first to find an algebraic solution to the biquadratic, or quartic, equation (an algebraic equation that contains the fourth power of the unknown quantity but no higher power).
From a poor family, Ferrari was taken into the service of the noted Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano as an errand boy at the age of 15. By attending Cardano’s lectures, he learned Latin, Greek, and mathematics. In 1540 he succeeded Cardano as public mathematics lecturer in Milan, at which time he found the solution of the quartic equation, later published in Cardano’s Ars magna (1545; “Great Art”). The publication of Ars magna brought Ferrari into a celebrated controversy with the noted Italian mathematician Niccolò Tartaglia over the solution of the cubic equation. After six printed challenges and counterchallenges, Ferrari and Tartaglia met in Milan on Aug. 10, 1548, for a public mathematical contest, of which Ferrari was declared the winner. This success brought him immediate fame, and he was deluged with offers for various positions. He accepted that from Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga, regent of Mantua, to become supervisor of tax assessments, an appointment that soon made him wealthy. Later, ill health and a quarrel with the cardinal forced him to give up his lucrative position. He then accepted a professorship in mathematics at the University of Bologna, where he died shortly thereafter.
