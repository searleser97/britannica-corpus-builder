Goldbach conjecture,  in number theory, assertion (here stated in modern terms) that every even counting number greater than 2 is equal to the sum of two prime numbers. The Russian mathematician Christian Goldbach first proposed this conjecture in a letter to the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1742. More precisely, Goldbach claimed that “every number greater than 2 is an aggregate of three prime numbers.” (In Goldbach’s day, the convention was to consider 1 a prime number, so his statement is equivalent to the modern version in which the convention is to not include 1 among the prime numbers.)
Goldbach’s conjecture was published in English mathematician Edward Waring’s Meditationes algebraicae (1770), which also contained Waring’s problem and what was later known as Vinogradov’s theorem. The latter, which states that every sufficiently large odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three primes, was proved in 1937 by the Russian mathematician Ivan Matveyevich Vinogradov. Further progress on Goldbach’s conjecture occurred in 1973, when the Chinese mathematician Chen Jing Run proved that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and a number with at most two prime factors.
