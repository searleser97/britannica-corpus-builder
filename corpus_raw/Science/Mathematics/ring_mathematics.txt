Ring,  in mathematics, a set having an addition that must be commutative (a + b = b + a for any a, b) and associative [a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c for any a, b, c], and a multiplication that must be associative [a(bc) = (ab)c for any a, b, c]. There must also be a zero (which functions as an identity element for addition), negatives of all elements (so that adding a number and its negative produces the ring’s zero element), and two distributive laws relating addition and multiplication [a(b + c) = ab + ac and (a + b)c = ac + bc for any a, b, c]. A commutative ring is a ring in which multiplication is commutative—that is, in which ab = ba for any a, b.
The simplest example of a ring is the collection of integers (…, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1,  2, 3, …) together with the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication.
