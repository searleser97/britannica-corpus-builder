Paraboloid,   an open surface generated by rotating a parabola (q.v.) about its axis. If the axis of the surface is the z axis and the vertex is at the origin, the intersections of the surface with planes parallel to the xz and yz planes are parabolas (see Figure, top). The intersections of the surface with planes parallel to and above the xy plane are circles. The general equation for this type of paraboloid is x2/a2 + y2/b2 = z.
If a = b, intersections of the surface with planes parallel to and above the xy plane produce circles, and the figure generated is the paraboloid of revolution. If a is not equal to b, intersections with planes parallel to the xy plane are ellipses, and the surface is an elliptical paraboloid.
If the surface of the paraboloid is defined by the equation x2/a2 - y2/b2 = z, cuts parallel to the xz and yz planes produce parabolas of intersection, and cutting planes parallel to xy produce hyperbolas. Such a surface is a hyperbolic paraboloid (see Figure, bottom).
A circular or elliptical paraboloid surface may be used as a parabolic reflector. Applications of this property are used in automobile headlights, solar furnaces, radar, and radio relay stations.
