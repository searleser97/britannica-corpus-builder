Laurent Lafforgue,  (born November 6, 1966, Antony, France), French mathematician who won the Fields Medal in 2002 for his work connecting number theory and analysis.
Lafforgue attended the École Normale Supérieure (1986–90) in Paris before receiving a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry from the University of Paris in 1994. In 2001 he became a permanent professor at the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies, Bures-sur-Yvette, France.
Lafforgue was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing in 2002. Building on work by the 1990 Fields Medalist, Russian Vladimir Drinfeld, Lafforgue established one important case of the Langlands conjectures. The Langlands conjectures, or Langlands Program, grew out of a 1967 letter that Robert Langlands wrote to André Weil, who was widely regarded as the leading number theorist of his generation. Langlands suggested a far-reaching generalization of what was already known concerning a deep connection between algebraic numbers and certain complex functions related to the classical Riemann zeta function. Hitherto, understanding had been limited to the cases where algebraic numbers are tied to the rational numbers by a commutative group (called a Galois group). Langlands proposed a way of dealing with the more general, noncommutative case. His conjectures have dominated the field since they were proposed, and their proof would unify large areas of algebra, number theory, and analysis, but proving them has been exceptionally difficult. Lafforgue has now established these conjectures in an analogous but profoundly significant setting. In his work Lafforgue established a “dictionary” in which prime numbers can be thought of as points on a curve, thus bringing together algebraic geometry and number theory. This allowed powerful tools from algebraic geometry to be applied to number theory problems.
