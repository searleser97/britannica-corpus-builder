Mathematical programming,  theoretical tool of management science and economics in which management operations are described by mathematical equations that can be manipulated for a variety of purposes. If the basic descriptions involved take the form of linear algebraic equations, the technique is described as linear programming. If more complex forms are required, the term nonlinear programming is applied. Mathematical programming is used in planning production schedules, in transportation, in military logistics, and in calculating economic growth, by inserting assumed values for the variables in the equations and solving for the unknowns. Computers are widely used in obtaining solutions.
