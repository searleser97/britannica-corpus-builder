Edward Thomas Copson,  (born Aug. 21, 1901, Scotland—died Feb. 16, 1980), mathematician known for his contributions to analysis and partial differential equations, especially as they apply to mathematical physics.
Copson studied at St. John’s College, Oxford, and then was a lecturer of mathematics first at the University of Edinburgh (1922–29) and then at the University of St. Andrews (1930–34). He was appointed assistant professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1934. The following year he accepted the post of professor of mathematics at University College, Dundee, which he held until appointed regius professor of mathematics at St. Andrews (1950–69).
In addition to his contributions to analysis and partial differential equations, Copson wrote the widely used Introduction to the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable (1935) and, in collaboration with Bevan B. Baker, The Mathematical Theory of Huygens’ Principle (1939), concerning the generation and structure of waves. His other publications include Asymptotic Expansions (1965) and Metric Spaces (1968).
