Intuitionism,   school of mathematical thought introduced by the 20th-century Dutch mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer that contends the primary objects of mathematical discourse are mental constructions governed by self-evident laws. Intuitionists have challenged many of the oldest principles of mathematics as being nonconstructive and hence mathematically meaningless. Compare formalism; logicism.
