Power of 10,  in mathematics, any of the whole-valued (integer) exponents of the number 10. A power of 10 is as many number 10s as indicated by the exponent multiplied together. Thus, shown in long form, a power of 10 is the number 1 followed by n zeros, where n is the exponent and is greater than 0; for example, 106 is written 1,000,000. When n is less than 0, the power of 10 is the number 1 n places after the decimal point; for example, 10âˆ’2 is written 0.01. When n is equal to 0, the power of 10 is 1; that is, 100 = 1.
