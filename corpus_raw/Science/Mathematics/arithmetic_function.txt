Arithmetic function,  any mathematical function defined for integers (…, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, …) and dependent upon those properties of the integer itself as a number, in contrast to functions that are defined for other values (real numbers, complex numbers, or even other functions) and that involve various operations from algebra and calculus. Examples of arithmetic functions include the following, which associate with each integer n: (1) the number of divisors of n; (2) the number of ways n can be represented as a sum or product of a specified number of integers; (3) the number of primes (integers not divisible by any number greater than one, except themselves) dividing n (including n itself). Arithmetic functions have applications in number theory, combinatorics, counting, probability theory, and analysis, in which they arise as the coefficients of power series.
