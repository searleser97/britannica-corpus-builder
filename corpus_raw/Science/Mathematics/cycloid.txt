Cycloid,   the curve generated by a point on the circumference of a circle that rolls along a straight line. If r is the radius of the circle and θ (theta) is the angular displacement of the circle, then the polar equations of the curve are x = r(θ - sin θ) and y = r(1 - cos θ).

The points of the curve that touch the straight line are separated along the line by a distance equal to 2πr, which is the circumference of the circle, indicating one complete revolution of the circle. The curve is periodic, which means that it repeats in an identical pattern for each cycle, or length of the line, that is equal to 2πr.
One variant of the simple cycloid is the curtate cycloid, for which the curve falls below the line at the cusps, making retrograde loops in which the curve moves in the direction opposite to that of the rolling circle.
The prolate cycloid is similar to the simple cycloid except that the curve has no cusps and does not intersect the line. The prolate is formed by a point on a radius less than that of the rolling circle, such as a point on the spoke of a wheel.
For the case of a circle rolled along outside the circumference of another circle, an epicycloid is formed. For a circle rolled along inside the circumference of another circle, a hypocycloid is formed. See also brachistochrone.
