Paul Lévy, in full Paul-pierre Lévy,  (born Sept. 15, 1886, Paris, France—died  Dec. 15, 1971), French mining engineer and mathematician noted for his work in the theory of probability.
After serving as a professor at the École des Mines de Saint-Étienne, Paris, from 1910 to 1913, Lévy joined the faculty (1914–51) of the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines, Paris. He also taught from 1920 to 1959 at the École Polytechnique in Paris.
Lévy contributed to the theory of probability, functional analysis, and other analysis problems, principally partial differential equations and series. He also studied geometry. Among his major works are Leçons d’analyse fonctionnelle (1922, 2nd ed., 1951; “Lessons in Functional Analysis”); Calcul des probabilités (1925; “Calculus of Probabilities”); Théorie de l’addition des variables aléatoires (1937–54; “The Theory of Addition of Multiple Variables”); and Processus stochastiques et mouvement brownien (1948; “Stochastic Processes and Brownian Motion”).
