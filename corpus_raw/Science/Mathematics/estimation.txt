Estimation,  in statistics, any of numerous procedures used to calculate the value of some property of a population from observations of a sample drawn from the population. A point estimate, for example, is the single number most likely to express the value of the property. An interval estimate defines a range within which the value of the property can be expected (with a specified degree of confidence) to fall. The 18th-century English theologian and mathematician Thomas Bayes was instrumental in the development of Bayesian estimation to facilitate revision of estimates on the basis of further information. (See Bayesâ€™s theorem.) In sequential estimation the experimenter evaluates the precision of the estimate during the sampling process, which is terminated as soon as the desired degree of precision has been achieved.
