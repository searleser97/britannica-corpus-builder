Determinant,  in linear and multilinear algebra, a value, denoted det A, associated with a square matrix A of n rows and n columns. Designating any element of the matrix by the symbol arc (the subscript r identifies the row and c the column), the determinant is evaluated by finding the sum of n! terms, each of which is the product of the coefficient (−1)r + c and n elements, no two from the same row or column. Determinants are of use in ascertaining whether a system of n equations in n unknowns has a solution. If B is an n × 1 vector and the determinant of A is nonzero, the system of equations AX = B always has a solution.
For the trivial case of n = 1, the value of the determinant is the value of the single element a11. For n = 2, the matrix is  and the determinant is a11a22 − a12a21.
Larger determinants ordinarily are evaluated by a stepwise process, expanding them into sums of terms, each the product of a coefficient and a smaller determinant. Any row or column of the matrix is selected, each of its elements arc is multiplied by the factor (−1)r + c and by the smaller determinant Mrc formed by deleting the rth row and cth column from the original array. Each of these products is expanded in the same way until the small determinants can be evaluated by inspection. At each stage, the process is facilitated by choosing the row or column containing the most zeros.
For example, the determinant of the matrix is most easily evaluated with respect to the second column:
