Atle Selberg,  (born June 14, 1917, Langesund, Nor.—died Aug. 6, 2007, Princeton, N.J., U.S.), Norwegian-born American mathematician who was awarded the Fields Medal in 1950 for his work in number theory. In 1986 he shared (with Samuel Eilenberg) the Wolf Prize.
Selberg attended the University of Oslo (Ph.D., 1943) and remained there as a research fellow until 1947. He then became a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J., and a member of the faculty from 1949 until his retirement in 1987. In the 1990s he became a U.S. citizen.
Selberg was awarded the Fields Medal at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Cambridge, Mass., in 1950. His work in analytic number theory produced fundamental and deep results on the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. He also made contributions in the study of sieves—particularly the Selberg sieve—which are generalizations of Eratosthenes’ method for locating prime numbers. In 1949 he gave an elementary (but by no means simple) proof of the prime number theorem, a result that had theretofore required advanced theorems from analysis. Many of Selberg’s papers were published in Number Theory, Trace Formulas and Discrete Groups (1989). His Collected Papers was published in 1989 and 1991.
