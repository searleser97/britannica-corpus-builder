Arthur Edwin Kennelly,  (born Dec. 17, 1861, Colaba, India—died  June 18, 1939, Boston), U.S. electrical engineer who made innovations in analytic methods in electronics, particularly the definitive application of complex-number theory to alternating-current (ac) circuits.
After working as an office boy for a London engineering society, as an electrician, and on a cable-engineering ship, in 1887 Kennelly joined Thomas Edison’s staff at West Orange, N.J., where he was chief assistant until 1894. Then, with Edwin J. Houston, he formed the consulting firm of Houston and Kennelly in Philadelphia.
The mathematical analysis of direct-current circuits was a simple matter, but the analysis of ac circuits was more complicated. The publication of Kennelly’s paper “Impedance” immediately allowed engineers to begin applying complex-number techniques to ac theory.
Kennelly noticed that Guglielmo Marconi’s reception, in Newfoundland in 1901, of radio signals transmitted from England was received far better than was predicted by radio-wave theory. The following year he postulated that the radio waves were being reflected back to Earth from an ionized layer in the upper atmosphere. Shortly thereafter the British physicist Oliver Heaviside independently propounded the same theory, and the layer thus became known as the Kennelly–Heaviside layer (now called the E region of the ionosphere).
