Kenneth Eugene Iverson,  (born Dec. 17, 1920, Camrose, Alta., Can.â€”died Oct. 19, 2004, Toronto, Ont.), Canadian mathematician and computer scientist who pioneered a very compact high-level computer programming language called APL (the initials of his book A Programming Language [1962]). The language made efficient use of the slow communication speeds of the computer terminals of that time, and APL enjoyed an enthusiastic following. Iverson taught mathematics at Harvard University from 1955 to 1960 and served on the staff of the research division of IBM from 1960 to 1980.
