Differential operator,  In mathematics, any combination of derivatives applied to a function. It takes the form of a polynomial of derivatives, such as D2xx − D2xy · D2yx, where D2 is a second derivative and the subscripts indicate partial derivatives. Special differential operators include the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplace operator (see Laplace’s equation). Differential operators provide a generalized way to look at differentiation as a whole, as well as a framework for discussion of the theory of differential equations.
