integral,  in mathematics, either a numerical value equal to the area under the graph of a function for some interval (definite integral) or a new function the derivative of which is the original function (indefinite integral). These two meanings are related by the fact that a definite integral of any function that can be integrated can be found using the indefinite integral and a corollary to the fundamental theorem of calculus. The definite integral (also called Riemann integral) of a function f(x) is denoted as(see integration [for symbol]) and is equal to the area of the region bounded by the curve (if the function is positive between x = a and x = b) y = f(x), the x-axis, and the lines x = a and x = b. An indefinite integral, sometimes called an antiderivative, of a function f(x), denoted byis a function the derivative of which is f(x). Because the derivative of a constant is zero, the indefinite integral is not unique. The process of finding an indefinite integral is called integration.
