Partial derivative,  In differential calculus, the derivative of a function of several variables with respect to change in just one of its variables. Partial derivatives are useful in analyzing surfaces for maximum and minimum points and give rise to partial differential equations. As with ordinary derivatives, a first partial derivative represents a rate of change or a slope of a tangent line. For a three-dimensional surface, two first partial derivatives represent the slope in each of two perpendicular directions. Second, third, and higher partial derivatives give more information about how the function changes at any point.
