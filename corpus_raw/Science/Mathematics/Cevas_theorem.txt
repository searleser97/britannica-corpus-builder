Ceva’s theorem,  in geometry, theorem concerning the vertices and sides of a triangle. In particular, the theorem asserts that for a given triangle ABC and points L, M, and N that lie on the sides AB, BC, and CA, respectively, a necessary and sufficient condition for the three lines from vertex to point opposite (AM, BN, CL) to intersect at a common point (be concurrent) is that the following relation hold between the line segments formed on the triangle:
BM∙CN∙AL = MC∙NA∙LB.
Although the theorem is credited to the Italian mathematician Giovanni Ceva, who published its proof in De Lineis Rectis (1678; “On Straight Lines”), it was proved earlier by Yūsuf al-Muʾtamin, king (1081–85) of Saragossa (see Hūdid dynasty). The theorem is quite similar to (technically, dual to) a geometric theorem proved by Menelaus of Alexandria in the 1st century ce.
