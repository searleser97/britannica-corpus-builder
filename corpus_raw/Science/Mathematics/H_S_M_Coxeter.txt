H.S.M. Coxeter, in full Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter,  (born Feb. 9, 1907, London, Eng.—died March 31, 2003, Toronto, Can.), British-born Canadian geometer, who was a leader in the understanding of non-Euclidean geometries, reflection patterns, and polytopes (higher-dimensional analogs of three-dimensional polyhedra).
Coxeter’s work served as an inspiration for R. Buckminster Fuller’s concept of the geodesic dome and, particularly, for the intricate geometric designs of Dutch graphic artist M.C. Escher; in 1997 Coxeter published a paper in which he demonstrated that Escher’s 1958 woodcut Circle Limit III was mathematically perfect.
Coxeter studied at Trinity College, Cambridge (Ph.D., 1931). In 1936 he joined the faculty of mathematics at the University of Toronto, where he remained until he retired in 1980. Coxeter wrote the entry on analytic geometry for the 1961 printing of the 14th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. In addition, he wrote some 200 papers and a dozen books, including Non-Euclidean Geometry (1942; 6th ed. 1998), Introduction to Geometry (1961), Regular Complex Polytopes (1974; 2nd ed. 1991), and Kaleidoscopes (1995). He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (1948) and of the British Royal Society (1950) and was named a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1997.
