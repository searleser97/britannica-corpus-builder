World Resources Institute (WRI),  research institute established in 1982 to promote environmentally sound and socially equitable development. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C.
The World Resources Institute conducts extensive scientific research and analysis on global environmental and economic problems and proposes adjustments to public policies or institutional protocols to facilitate positive environmental and economic change. The WRI’s many projects address issues in four key areas: people and ecosystems (stopping the destruction of the Earth’s ecosystems to ensure the future availability of natural resources), access to information concerning the environment and environmental problems, climate protection (reducing emissions of gases that contribute to global warming and aiding the adaptation to inevitable climate change), and markets and enterprise (expanding economic opportunity while protecting the environment).
In keeping with the organization’s priorities, the WRI created an accounting system, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), which is used worldwide to measure and manage greenhouse-gas emissions. In addition, EMBARQ, a project to provide affordable and sustainable solutions to urban transportation problems, was established in 2002. Other WRI initiatives include Global Forest Watch, which works to preserve forests without compromising human needs, and Green Fees, which promotes environmentally friendly tax reforms. The organization disseminates environmental information through online data collection, a monthly e-mail newsletter, a library and information centre in Washington, D.C., and other sources. The WRI has nearly 400 partners—ranging from international organizations to local activists—in more than 50 countries. The organization is governed by a board of directors.
