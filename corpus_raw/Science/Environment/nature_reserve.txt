Nature reserve,  area set aside for the purpose of preserving certain animals, plants, or both. A nature reserve differs from a national park usually in being smaller and having as its sole purpose the protection of nature.
Endangered species are often kept in reserves, away from the hunters who brought them close to extinction. In the United States, numerous wildlife refuges have served this purpose, especially with respect to birds. Nature reserves are also numerous in Europe, India, Indonesia, and some African countries.
The origin of modern nature reserves lies in medieval times, when landowners established game preserves for the protection of animals that they hunted. The idea of protecting animals simply to keep them from dying out did not arise until the 19th century.
