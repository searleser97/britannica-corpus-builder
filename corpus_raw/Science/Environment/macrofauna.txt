Macrofauna,   in soil science, animals that are one centimetre or more long but smaller than an earthworm. Potworms, myriapods, centipedes, millipedes, slugs, snails, fly larvae, beetles, beetle larvae, and spiders are typical members of the macrofauna. Many of these animals burrow in the soil, aiding soil drainage and aeration; in addition, some organic material passes into the soil through the burrows. Most macrofauna consume decaying plant material and organic debris, but centipedes, some insects, and spiders prey on other soil animals.
