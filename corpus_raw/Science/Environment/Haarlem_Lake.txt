Haarlem Lake, Dutch Haarlemmermeer,  polder (area 45,700 acres [18,486 hectares]) coextensive with the gemeente (municipality) of Haarlemmermeer in western Netherlands. Originally, a number of lakes—with a combined area of about 14,000 acres (5,700 hectares) in 1531—were formed into one by successive inundations, and by the 1830s the water area had increased to nearly 45,000 acres (18,200 hectares). Floods frequently threatened the cities of Haarlem and Amsterdam, and a plan to dike and drain the lake with pumps powered by 160 windmills had been proposed by Jan Adriaanszoon Leeghwater as early as 1640. After hurricanes in 1836 carried floodwaters to the gates of Amsterdam and inundated Leiden, a royal commission of inquiry’s proposal to drain the lake was approved (1839); reclamation took place between 1840 and 1852. A waterway called the Ring Canal was first dug around the lake in order to receive the water and to accommodate shipping, which the lake had previously carried. Since the water from the lake had no natural outlet, pumping by steam engines began in 1848, and the lake was dry by 1852. The polder area (42,096 acres [17,036 hectares]) recovered from the waters brought in enough money to cover the cost of the enterprise, so that the actual cost to the country was only the interest on the capital. The soil of the polder is mainly clay, and most of it very fertile. Most of the land is arable, with small portions used as pasture.
