Mallee, also spelled Mellee,  a scrubland vegetation found in southern Australia. It is composed primarily of woody shrubs and trees of the genus Eucalyptus. These evergreen plants have leathery, thick leaves that prevent water loss during the hot dry season. Most scrubland growth occurs during the rainy season.
The extensive scrublands of southwestern Australia have a rich and varied vegetation, although only a few plant families are represented. Many of the approximately 1,000 species of shrubs found there have spiny branches or leaves, and most bear colourful flowers during the wet season.
