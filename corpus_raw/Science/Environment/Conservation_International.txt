Conservation International,  organization that works in more than 40 countries, especially developing ones, to protect biodiversity in land and marine ecosystems. It was founded in 1987. Its scientists study global biodiversity and have identified hot spotsâ€”that is, sites that are the most threatened by habitat loss and degradation but also possess high numbers of endemic species and exceptional biological richness. The organization works with governments, communities, farmers, and businesses in such places to adopt a wide variety of conservation measures.
