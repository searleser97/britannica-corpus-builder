Mesofauna, also called Meiofauna,  in soil science, intermediate-sized animals (those greater than 40 microns in length, which is about three times the thickness of a human hair). Nematodes, mites, springtails, proturans, and pauropods are typical members of the mesofauna. These animals may feed upon microorganisms, other soil animals, decaying plant or animal material, living plants, or fungi. Most mesofauna feed on decaying plant material; by removing roots they open drainage and aeration channels in the soil. The channels contain mesofaunal fecal material that can be broken down by smaller organisms.
