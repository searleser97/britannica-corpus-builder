Mixed forest,   a vegetational transition between coniferous forest and broad-leaved deciduous forest, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. “Mixed forest” also may denote a forest with two or more dominant tree species. In North America, the term is often used to designate the forest of the Appalachian Plateau, characterized by many tree species and moderate precipitation.
