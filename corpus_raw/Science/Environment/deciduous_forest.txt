Deciduous forest,  vegetation composed primarily of broad-leaved trees that shed all their leaves during one season. Deciduous forest is found in three middle-latitude regions with a temperate climate characterized by a winter season and year-round precipitation: eastern North America, western Eurasia, and northeastern Asia. Deciduous forest also extends into more arid regions along stream banks and around bodies of water. For the deciduous forest of tropical regions, see monsoon forest.
Oaks, beeches, birches, chestnuts, aspens, elms, maples, and basswoods (or lindens) are the dominant trees in mid-latitude deciduous forests. They vary in shape and height and form dense growths that admit relatively little light through the leafy canopy. Shrubs are found primarily near clearings and forest edges, where more light is available, and herbaceous flowering plants are abundant within the forest in the spring, before the trees come into full leaf.
The soils upon which deciduous forests thrive are gray-brown and brown podzols. They are slightly acidic and have a granular humus layer known as mull, which is a porous mixture of organic material and mineral soil. Mull humus harbours many bacteria and invertebrate animals such as earthworms.
Snails, slugs, insects, and spiders are common inhabitants of the deciduous forest, and many cold-blooded vertebrates, such as snakes, frogs, salamanders, and turtles, are also present. Birds are represented by warblers, flycatchers, vireos, thrushes, woodpeckers, hawks, and owls. Prominent mammals include mice, moles, chipmunks, rabbits, weasels, foxes, bears, and deer.
Differences in temperature, moisture, and elevation may cause the formation of distinct plant associations within the deciduous-forest pattern. The dominance of beeches and maples in the northern part of the eastern North American deciduous forest and that of oaks and hickories along the southern extension of this vegetation are typical examples.
