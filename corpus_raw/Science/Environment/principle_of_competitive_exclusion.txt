Principle of competitive exclusion, also called Gause’s principle, or Grinnell’s axiom,  (after G.F. Gause, a Soviet biologist, and J. Grinnell, an American naturalist, who first clearly established it), statement that in competition between species that seek the same ecological niche, one species survives while the other expires under a given set of environmental conditions. The result is that each species occupies a distinct niche.
