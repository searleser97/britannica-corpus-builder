Flyway,   route used regularly by migrating birds, bats, or butterflies. The large majority of such migrants move from northern breeding grounds to southern wintering grounds and back, and most of the well-used flyways follow north-south river valleys (e.g., the Mississippi River valley), coastlines (especially those of North America and East Asia), or mountain ranges. A flyway may be only a few hundred metres wide at certain points, such as mountain passes and the crossing points of water bodies; in other places it may be hundreds of kilometres wide. In one notable flyway, hundreds of thousands of storks and large birds of prey from eastern Europe cross the Bosporus in a narrow stream, spread out over Turkey and around the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, then bunch together again to cross the north end of the Suez Canal into Africa.
