Megafauna,  in soil science, animals such as earthworms and small vertebrates (e.g., moles, mice, hares, rabbits, gophers, snakes, and lizards). The food habits of soil megafauna vary; earthworms ingest both soil and organic matter, but most of the vertebrates feed on plant material, invertebrates, and other small vertebrate animals. Megafauna are the principal agents of soil turnover and distribution; this movement loosens soil structure, improves aeration and drainage, and distributes soil microorganisms.
Outside of soil science, the term megafauna refers to the largest mammals (and sometimes the largest birds and reptiles), often those that were the first to be exterminated following human contact.
