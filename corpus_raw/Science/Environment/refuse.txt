Refuse, also called municipal solid waste,  nonhazardous solid waste that requires collection and transport to a processing or disposal site. Refuse includes garbage and rubbish. Garbage is mostly decomposable food waste or yard waste that is highly putrescible, while rubbish is mostly dry material such as glass, paper, cloth, or wood that does not readily decompose. Some forms of rubbish are recyclable, and some municipalities compost yard waste and other garbage on a large scale. Trash is rubbish that includes bulky items such as old refrigerators, couches, or large tree stumps. Trash, especially electronic waste, may require special collection and handling. The sources of refuse include residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial activities. See also solid waste management.
