Indian summer,  period of dry, unseasonably warm weather in late October or November in the central and eastern United States. The term originated in New England and probably arose from the Indians’ practice of gathering winter stores at this time. This autumn warm period also occurs in Europe, where in Britain it is called All-hallown summer or Old Wives’ summer. Indian summer may occur several times in some years and not at all in others; it often persists for a week or longer. The nights are cool and may bring frost, and the days have hazy skies and light winds. The lack of clouds causes the daytime hours to be quite pleasant as the air usually has a low relative humidity and the trees have their autumn foliage.
In the United States, an Indian summer period occurs when a cool, shallow polar air mass stagnates and becomes a deep, warm high-pressure centre. This centre is characterized by a strong low-level temperature inversion that produces a stable air stratification. As a result, vertical air motions are inhibited, and smoke and dust are concentrated near the ground, which accounts for the haziness.
