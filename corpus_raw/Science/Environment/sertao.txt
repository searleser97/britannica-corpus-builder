Sertão,  (Portuguese: “backwoods,” or “bush”), dry interior region of northeastern Brazil that is largely covered with caatingas (scrubby upland forests). Sertão is also used to refer to the sparsely populated wilderness beyond areas of permanent settlement and may be equated with the Canadian “bush,” the U.S. “backwoods,” or the Australian “Outback.”
