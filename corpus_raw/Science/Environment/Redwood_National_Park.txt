Redwood National Park,  national park in the northwestern corner of California, U.S. It was established in 1968, with a boundary change in 1978, and was designated a World Heritage site in 1980. Preserving virgin (old-growth) groves of ancient redwood trees, including the world’s tallest tree, the park also features 40 miles (64 km) of scenic Pacific coastline. It covers an area of 172 square miles (445 square km)—of which more than one-third is old-growth forest—and includes land held in three state parks: Jedediah Smith Redwoods, Del Norte Coast Redwoods, and Prairie Creek Redwoods.
The national park (and state parks) stretch along the California coast from Crescent City, headquarters of the national park, south past the mouth of the Klamath River to the environs of the town of Orick. Sea lions and harbour seals live offshore; bald eagles, doubled-crested cormorants, and endangered California brown pelicans glide above the ocean beaches and sea cliffs; and farther inland summer fog provides additional moisture for the redwood forests. Although there are black bears in the park, the Roosevelt elk is the most commonly seen wild mammal. Other wildlife includes coyotes, bobcats, blacktail deer, chipmunks, and squirrels.
The coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), which is found in the park, is fast-growing and among the longest-lived species on earth (living an average of 600 years); it is also the tallest of the world’s trees. In 1963 a redwood called “Tall Tree,” located on Redwood Creek in Tall Trees Grove in the southern section of the park, was measured at 367.8 feet (112.1 metres) tall (although its top broke off later) and had a diameter of 14 feet (4 metres). Though reduced in extent by commercial logging, which continues today outside the park, redwoods can live as long as 2,000 years, protected from fire by their thick, sapless bark.
Hiking, backpacking, and camping are popular in the park.
