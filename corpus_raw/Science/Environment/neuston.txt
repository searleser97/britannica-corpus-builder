Neuston,   group of organisms found on top of or attached to the underside of the surface film of water. The neuston includes insects such as whirligig beetles and water striders, some spiders and protozoans, and occasional worms, snails, insect larvae, and hydras. It is distinguished from the plankton, which only incidentally becomes associated with the surface film.
