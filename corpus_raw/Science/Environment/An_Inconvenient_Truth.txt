An Inconvenient Truth,  American documentary film, released in 2006, featuring the multimedia presentation of former U.S. vice president Al Gore that formed the basis for his traveling lecture tour on the emerging human challenge of global warming and climate change.
From the stage of a small theatre in Los Angeles, Calif., Gore juxtaposes the science behind global warming with elements from his own personal and political life, mixing seriousness with humour to convey his message. His presentation uses a collection of graphs, photographs, and other imagery to describe the greenhouse effect, changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations throughout history, human energy use and population growth, and how all these forces contribute to global warming. In the second half of the film, Gore describes some of the projected effects of global warming, citing some of the early signs of changing conditions in the Arctic and Antarctic. The film concludes with Gore addressing common misconceptions surrounding global warming and challenging viewers to bring about needed changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The credits provide viewers with suggestions on how they can combat global warming in their own communities.
Goreâ€™s descriptions of climatic processes and warming extrapolations have been criticized, particularly by skeptics of global warming. Many climate scientists agree that some of the statements made in the film exaggerate projections or gloss over the nuances associated with the science of climate change. However, they maintain that the science depicted in the film is largely accurate. An Inconvenient Truth won Academy Awards in 2006 for best feature-length documentary feature and best song. Since its release the film has been made part of the curricula of many schools around the world, but some local school districts voiced their disapproval of its use without the presentation of opposing views.
