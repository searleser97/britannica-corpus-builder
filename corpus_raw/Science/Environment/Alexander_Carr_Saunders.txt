Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders, in full Sir Alexander Morris Carr-Saunders,  (born January 14, 1886, Reigate, Surrey, England—died October 6, 1966, Thirlmere, Cumberland), sociologist, demographer, and educational administrator who, as vice chancellor of the University of London, was largely responsible for establishing several overseas university colleges, some of which became independent universities. Among them were the universities of Khartoum, Sudan; Malaya at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Ibadan, Nigeria; the West Indies at Kingston, Jamaica; and East Africa in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.
Educated in biology, Carr-Saunders became a social worker in the East End of London, helping to direct (1912–13) Toynbee Hall, the pioneer British settlement house. Simultaneously, he studied law and was called to the bar in 1913. He was a professor of social sciences at the University of Liverpool (1923–37) and director of the London School of Economics and Political Science, University of London (1937–56). He began his work with the university colleges outside Europe shortly after World War II. He was knighted in 1946.
Carr-Saunders’s first important book, The Population Problem (1922), was one of the earliest significant historical studies in demography. His World Population (1936) contained demographic data on numerous countries that had never before been the subjects of such study. He also wrote A Survey of the Social Structure of England and Wales (with D. Caradog Jones, 1927), The Professions (with P.A. Wilson, 1933), and New Universities Overseas (1961).
