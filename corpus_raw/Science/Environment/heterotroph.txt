Heterotroph,  in ecology, an organism that consumes other organisms in a food chain.
In contrast to autotrophs, heterotrophs are unable to produce organic substances from inorganic ones. They must rely on an organic source of carbon that has originated as part of another living organism. Heterotrophs depend either directly or indirectly on autotrophs for nutrients and food energy. For example, raccoons might consume corn (maize) planted in a field, or they might catch and eat rodents that rely on corn as a food source.
