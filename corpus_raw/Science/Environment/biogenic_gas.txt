Biogenic gas,  any gas critical for and produced by living organisms. Biogenic gases in the atmosphere play a role in the dynamics of Earth’s planetary radiation budget, the thermodynamics of the planet’s moist atmosphere, and, indirectly, the mechanics of the fluid flows that are Earth’s planetary wind systems. In the contemporary atmosphere, they include oxygen, nitrogen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid, ammonia and ammonium ions, nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, and a complex array of non-methane hydrocarbons. Of these gases, only nitrogen and oxygen are not “greenhouse gases.”
