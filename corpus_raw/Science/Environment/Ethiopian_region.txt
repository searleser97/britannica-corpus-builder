Ethiopian region, also called Afrotropical Region,   one of the major land areas of the world defined on the basis of its characteristic animal life. Part of the Paleotropical, or Afro-Tethyan, realm, it encompasses Africa south of the Sahara and the southwestern tip of Arabia. The island of Madagascar is part of the separate Madagascan region. The Ethiopian region has the worldâ€™s largest concentration of antelopes, giraffes, gorillas, and rhinoceroses, as well as a rich variety of other animals. The vegetational division roughly corresponding to this region is the African division of the Indoafrican subkingdom (which excludes the southern tip of Africa).
