Elfin woodland,  stunted forest at high elevations in tropical wet areas. Its low, gnarled trees are heavily draped with air plants, and its floor is cushioned by mosses and other primitive plants. Elfinwood, or Krummholz, is a similar stunted forest characteristic of most Alpine regions. See also cloud forest.
