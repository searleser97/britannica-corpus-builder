United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA),  formerly (1969â€“87) known as United Nations Fund for Population Activities,  trust fund under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Established in 1969, the UNFPA is the largest international source of assistance for population programs and the leading United Nations (UN) organization for the implementation of the 1994 Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development. It funds assistance, research, and advocacy programs in three major areas: (1) reproductive health, including family planning, safe motherhood, and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, (2) the population problems of developed and developing countries and possible strategies for addressing them, and (3) issues related to the status of women, including the gender gap in education. UNFPA assistance programs are undertaken only in response to government requests.
