Cannibalism,   in zoology, the eating of any animal by another member of the same species. Cannibalism frequently serves as a mechanism to control population or to ensure the genetic contribution of an individual. In certain ants, injured immatures are regularly consumed. When food is lacking, the colony turns to the remaining healthy immatures. This practice allows the adults to survive the food shortage and live to breed again. In lions, males taking over a pride may kill and eat the existing young; the mothers who lose their cubs will then more rapidly become impregnated by the new dominant males. Aquarium guppies will regulate their population size by eating most of their young. When confined to cages, many animals, among them the popular golden hamster, may devour their young if disturbed.
