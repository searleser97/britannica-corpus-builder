Monsoon forest, also called dry forest or tropical deciduous forest,  open woodland in tropical areas that have a long dry season followed by a season of heavy rainfall. The trees in a monsoon forest usually shed their leaves during the dry season and come into leaf at the start of the rainy season. Many lianas (woody vines) and herbaceous epiphytes (air plants, such as orchids are present. Monsoon forests are especially well developed in Southeast Asia and are typified by tall teak trees and thickets of bamboo.
