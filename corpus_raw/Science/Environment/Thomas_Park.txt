Thomas Park,  (born Nov. 17, 1908, Danville, Ill., U.S.—died March 30, 1992, Chicago, Ill.), U.S. animal ecologist known for his experiments with beetles in analyzing population dynamics.
After earning a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1932, Park taught at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and at the University of Chicago. He wrote, with others, Principles of Animal Ecology (1949), which applied principles first formulated in studies of plant ecology to animal relationships in an evolutionary perspective. Park was part of a team of ecologists at the University of Chicago who first emphasized the use of quantitative and experimental methods. He was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1961, and he received the Eminent Ecologist Citation from the Ecological Society of America in 1971.
Using two species of flour beetles, Tribolium confusum and T. castaneum, Park studied the efforts of competition caused by overcrowding. By analyzing birth and death rates, he found that in any mixed population one of the species always declined in numbers and became extinct, while the other increased in numbers in a characteristic percentage of tests. Overcrowding always led to a decrease in the a birth rate of the less fit species with an increase in disease, malformations, and death rate. Some scientists thought that the implications of Park’s experiments on insects might be applied to human populations as well.
