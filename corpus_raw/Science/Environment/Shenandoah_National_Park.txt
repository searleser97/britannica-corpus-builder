Shenandoah National Park,  preserve of 311 square miles (805 square km) in the Blue Ridge section of the Appalachian Mountains, in northern Virginia, U.S. The park was authorized in 1926 and established in 1935.
The park is noted for its scenery, which affords some of the most spectacular panoramic views in the eastern states. Skyline Drive, 105 miles (169 km) long, runs the length of the park from north to south, winding among the peaks and through valleys and gaps. This accessibility to the crest of the Blue Ridge is because of the great age of the granitic and metamorphosed basaltic mountains, which have been rounded and worn down by millions of years of erosion.
Except for a few grassy meadows, the park is heavily forested with both hardwoods (hickory and oak) and conifers (pine). From spring to autumn a succession of brilliant wildflowers bloom. Wildlife includes deer, bears, foxes, squirrels, and other mammals, along with numerous birds, some of which migrate south in the winter. The park is a unique example of an area that was overused—in this instance by mountain farmers—and was allowed to return to its natural state. The Appalachian National Scenic Trail roughly parallels Skyline Drive through the park.
