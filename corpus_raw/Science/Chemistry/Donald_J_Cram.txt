Donald J. Cram, in full Donald James Cram,  (born April 22, 1919, Chester, Vermont, U.S.—died June 17, 2001, Palm Desert, California), American chemist who, along with Charles J. Pedersen and Jean-Marie Lehn, was awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his creation of molecules that mimic the chemical behaviour of molecules found in living systems.
Cram was educated at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, and at the University of Nebraska, and he received a doctorate in organic chemistry from Harvard University in 1947. He joined the faculty of the University of California at Los Angeles in 1947 and became a full professor there in 1956 and emeritus in 1990.
Cram amplified and expanded upon Pedersen’s ground-breaking synthesis of the crown ethers—basically two-dimensional organic compounds that are able to recognize and selectively combine with the ions of certain metal elements. Cram synthesized molecules that took this chemistry into three dimensions, creating an array of differently shaped molecules that could interact selectively with other chemicals because of their complementary three-dimensional structures. His work represents a large step toward the synthesis of functional laboratory-made mimics of enzymes and other natural molecules whose special chemical behaviour is due to their characteristic structure.
