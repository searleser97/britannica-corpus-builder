Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH),  a peptide hormone that stimulates both the synthesis and the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the corticotropin-producing cells (corticotrophs) of the anterior pituitary gland. CRH consists of a single chain of 41 amino acids. Many factors of neuronal and hormonal origin regulate the secretion of CRH, and it is the final common element that directs the bodyâ€™s response to many forms of stress, including physical and emotional stresses and external and internal stresses.
In healthy individuals ACTH is secreted in a circadian rhythm, which in turn causes pulsatile and diurnal secretion of cortisol. Variations in the secretion of ACTH are caused by variations in the secretion of CRH by the hypothalamus in the brain as well as by variations in serum cortisol concentrations. An increase in serum cortisol inhibits the secretion of both CRH and ACTH. Conversely, the secretion of these hormones is increased when serum levels of cortisol decrease, thereby restoring to normal the serum concentrations of cortisol.
Excessive secretion of CRH leads to an increase in the size and number of corticotrophs in the pituitary gland. This may result in the formation of a corticotroph tumour that produces excessive amounts of ACTH, resulting in overstimulation of the adrenal cortex and abnormally high serum concentrations of adrenal androgens as well as cortisol. Excessive secretion of cortisol causes Cushing syndrome, which is characterized by trunk and facial obesity, high blood pressure (hypertension), and generalized protein breakdown, causing skin and muscle atrophy and loss of bone. In contrast, a deficiency of CRH can, by decreasing ACTH secretion, cause adrenocortical deficiency.
