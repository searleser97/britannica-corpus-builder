R.L.M. Synge, in full Richard Laurence Millington Synge,  (born Oct. 28, 1914, Liverpool, Eng.—died  Aug. 18, 1994, Norwich, Norfolk), British biochemist who in 1952 shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry with A.J.P. Martin for their development of partition chromatography, notably paper chromatography.
Synge studied at Winchester College, Cambridge, and received his Ph.D. at Trinity College there in 1941. He spent his entire professional career conducting research, initially with Martin under the auspices of the Wool Industries Research Association, Leeds (1941–43). The two men developed partition chromatography, a technique that is used to separate mixtures of closely related chemicals such as amino acids for identification and further study. Synge used paper chromatography to work out the exact structure of the simple protein molecule gramicidin S, which helped to pave the way for the English biochemist Frederick Sanger’s elucidation of the structure of the insulin molecule.
Synge did research at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, London (1943–48), and at the Rowett Research Institute, near Aberdeen, Scot. (1948–67). He became a biochemist at the Food Research Institute, Norwich (1967–76), and was also an honorary professor of biological sciences at the University of East Anglia (1968–84).
