Methyl group,   one of the commonest structural units of organic compounds, consisting of three hydrogen atoms bonded to a carbon atom, which is linked to the remainder of the molecule. The methyl radical (CH3), the methyl cation (CH+3), and the methyl anion (CH-3)34 are transient intermediates in many chemical reactions.
