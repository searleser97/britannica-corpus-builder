Pyruvic acid,  (CH3COCOOH), is an organic acid that probably occurs in all living cells. It ionizes to give a hydrogen ion and an anion, termed pyruvate. Biochemists use the terms pyruvate and pyruvic acid almost interchangeably.
Pyruvic acid is a key product at the crossroads between the catabolism (breaking down) and anabolism (synthesizing) of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. A complex sequence of enzyme reactions leading from sugar (or carbohydrate, in the form of glucose or fructose) to pyruvate is common to five metabolic processes. These are: (1) the fermentation of sugar to ethyl alcohol by yeast; (2) the fermentation of sugar to lactic acid in muscle; (3) the oxidation of sugar to carbon dioxide and water by way of the Krebs cycle; (4) the conversion of sugar to fatty acids; and (5) the conversion of sugar to amino acids, such as alanine, which are the building blocks of proteins.
Pyruvic acid, formerly called pyroracemic acid, was first obtained by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1835 by the dry distillation of tartaric acid. The preparation of pyruvic acid in bulk amounts is similar: tartaric acid is heated with fused potassium hydrogen sulfate at 210–220 °C. The product is purified by fractional distillation under reduced pressure. At room temperature, pure pyruvic acid is a colourless liquid with a pungent odour resembling that of acetic acid. On cooling, it forms crystals that melt at 13.6 °C. The boiling point is 165 °C.
