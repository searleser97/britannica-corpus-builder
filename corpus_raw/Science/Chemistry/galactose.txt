Galactose,   a member of a group of carbohydrates known as simple sugars (monosaccharides). It is usually found in nature combined with other sugars, as, for example, in lactose (milk sugar). Galactose is also found in complex carbohydrates (see polysaccharide) and in carbohydrate-containing lipids called glycolipids, which occur in the brain and other nervous tissues of most animals.
