Cyanide,  any compound containing the monovalent combining group CN. In inorganic cyanides, such as sodium cyanide (NaCN), this group is present as the negatively charged cyanide ion; these compounds, which are regarded as salts of hydrocyanic acid, are highly toxic. Organic cyanides are usually called nitriles; in these, the CN group is linked by a covalent bond to a carbon-containing group, such as methyl (CH3) in methyl cyanide (acetonitrile).
Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide (HCN), is a highly volatile liquid. HCN is manufactured via the Andrussow process, in which methane, ammonia, and oxygen are combined with a platinum metal catalyst. The HCN product is used to prepare acrylonitrile, which is used in the production of acrylic fibres, synthetic rubber, and plastics. Cyanides are employed in a number of chemical processes, including fumigation, case hardening of iron and steel, electroplating, and the concentration of ores. In nature, substances that can be chemically converted into cyanide are present in certain seeds, such as the pit of the black cherry (Prunus serotina) and the seeds of apples (Malus domestica).
Cyanide poisoning results from inhaling HCN or ingesting HCN salts. Cyanide acts with extreme rapidity, and thus the promptness with which an antidote, such as amyl nitrite, sodium nitrite, or sodium thiosulfate solution, is administered is critical to preventing death.
