Johan Gottlieb Gahn,  (born Aug. 19, 1745, Voxna, near Söderhamn, Swed.—died  Dec. 8, 1818, Stockholm), Swedish mineralogist and crystallographer who discovered manganese in 1774. His failure to win fame may be related to the fact that he published little. He saved the notes, papers, and letters of his friend Carl Wilhelm Scheele, who discovered chlorine, but not his own. His essays on the balance and use of the blowpipe in analysis were recorded by Jöns Jacob Berzelius of Sweden. Gahn was assistant to Torbern Bergman, pioneer analytical chemist and physicist at the University of Uppsala. With Scheele, Gahn discovered phosphoric acid in bones and prepared phosphorus from bones. He improved copper-smelting processes and studied technical applications of minerals, opening new branches of industry. Gahnite (zinc spinel) is named for him. In 1784 he was appointed assessor of the mining college at Stockholm.
