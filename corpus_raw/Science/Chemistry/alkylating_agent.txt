Alkylating agent,  any highly reactive drug that binds to certain chemical groups (phosphate, amino, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, and imidazole groups) commonly found in nucleic acids and other macromolecules, bringing about changes in the DNA and RNA of cells. Alkylating agents were the first anticancer drugs used, and, despite their hazards, they remain a cornerstone of anticancer therapy. Some examples of alkylating agents are nitrogen mustards (chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide), cisplatin, nitrosoureas (carmustine, lomustine, and semustine), alkylsulfonates (busulfan), ethyleneimines (thiotepa), and triazines (dacarbazine).
The types of molecular changes induced by alkylating agents include cross-linking between strands of DNA and the loss of a basic component (purine) from or the breaking of the nucleic acid. The result is that the nucleic acid will not be replicated. Either the altered DNA will be unable to carry out the functions of the cell, resulting in cell death (cytotoxicity), or the altered DNA will change the cell characteristics, resulting in an altered cell (mutagenic change). This change may result in the ability or tendency to produce cancerous cells (carcinogenicity). Normal cells may also be affected and become cancer cells.
Alkylating agents can cause severe nausea and vomiting as well as decreases in the number of red blood cells and white blood cells. The decrease in the number of white cells results in susceptibility to infection. Alkylating agents have found use in the treatment of lymphoma, leukemia, testicular cancer, melanoma, brain cancer, and breast cancer. They are most often used in combination with other anticancer drugs.
