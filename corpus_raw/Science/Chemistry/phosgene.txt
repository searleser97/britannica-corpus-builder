Phosgene, also called carbonyl chloride,  a colourless, chemically reactive, highly toxic gas having an odour like that of musty hay, used in making organic chemicals, dyestuffs, polycarbonate resins, and isocyanates for making polyurethane resins. It first came into prominence during World War I, when it was used, either alone or mixed with chlorine, against troops. Inhalation causes severe lung injury, the full effects appearing several hours after exposure.
First prepared in 1811, phosgene is manufactured by the reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine in the presence of a catalyst. It can be formed by the thermal decomposition of chlorinated hydrocarbons; e.g., when carbon tetrachloride (q.v.) is used as a fire extinguisher. Gaseous phosgene, which has a density about three and one-half times that of air, liquefies at a temperature of 8.2° C (46.8° F); it is usually stored and transported as the liquid under pressure in steel cylinders or as a solution in toluene. With water, phosgene reacts to form carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid.
