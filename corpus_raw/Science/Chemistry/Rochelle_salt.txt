Rochelle salt, also called Sodium Potassium Tartrate Tetrahydrate,  a crystalline solid having a large piezoelectric effect (electric charge induced on its surfaces by mechanical deformation due to pressure, twisting, or bending), making it useful in sensitive acoustical and vibrational devices. Like other piezoelectric materials, Rochelle salt crystals (KNaC4H4O6·4H2O) become strained when subjected to electric fields. They decompose at moderately high temperatures (55° C [131° F]) and require protection against moisture. Piezoelectric deformation is directly proportional to the applied electric field and reverses as the polarity of the applied field is reversed. These basic properties are put to use in electromechanical transducers such as ultrasonic generators, microphones, and phonograph pickups and in electromechanical resonators.
