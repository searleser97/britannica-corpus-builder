Technetium (Tc),  chemical element, synthetic radioactive metal of Group 7 (VIIb) of the periodic table, the first element to be artificially produced. The isotope technetium-97 (4,210,000-year half-life) was discovered (1937) by the Italian mineralogist Carlo Perrier and the Italian-born American physicist Emilio Segrè in a sample of molybdenum that had been bombarded by deuterons in the Berkeley (California) cyclotron. This isotope is the longest-lived member of a set from technetium-85 to technetium-114 that has since been produced. The most important isotope, because it is the only one available on a large scale, is technetium-99 (211,000-year half-life); it is produced in kilogram quantities as a fission product in nuclear reactors. Technetium metal looks like platinum but is usually obtained as a gray powder. It crystallizes in the hexagonal close-packed structure and is a superconductor below 11.2 K. Except for technetium-99, technetium-97, and technetium-98 (4,200,000-year half-life), technetium isotopes are short-lived. The metastable isotope technetium-99m (6-hour half-life), used with radiographic scanning devices, is valuable for studying the anatomic structure of organs. Technetium is also used as a metallurgical tracer and in corrosion-resistant products.
Technetium occurs in the Earth’s crust as minute traces from the spontaneous fission of uranium; the relatively short half-lives preclude the existence of any primordial technetium on Earth. The American astronomer Paul W. Merrill’s discovery in 1952 that technetium-99 is present in S-type stars was a valuable piece of evidence concerning stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. Technetium, chemically similar to rhenium (atomic number 75), exists in oxidation states of +7, +6, and +4 in compounds such as potassium pertechnetate, KTcO4, technetium chloride, TcCl6, and technetium sulfide, TcS2, respectively. Compounds are known in all formal oxidation states from −1 to +7.
