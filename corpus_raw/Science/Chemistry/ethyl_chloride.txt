Ethyl chloride (C2H5Cl), also called chloroethane,  colourless, flammable gas belonging to the family of organohalogen compounds. At one time, ethyl chloride was a high-volume industrial chemical used in the preparation of the gasoline additive tetraethyl lead. Beginning with restrictions on leaded gasoline in the 1970s and continuing until the eventual ban on its use in 1997, ethyl chloride production decreased. Today, ethyl chloride has limited applications; it is used mainly in the production of other organic chemicals.
It has been used as a local anesthetic for small incisions, tooth extractions, and needle punctures by spraying it on the surface of the skin, where its rapid evaporation produces a numbing sensation.
Ethyl chloride is prepared from ethylene by reaction with hydrogen chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride as a catalyst. Ethyl chloride boils at 12.3 °C (54.1 °F) and freezes at −138.7 °C (−217.7 °F); it dissolves freely in alcohol, ether, and other organic solvents but only slightly in water.
