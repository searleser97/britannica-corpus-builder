Polyacrylate elastomer,  any of a class of synthetic rubbers produced by the copolymerization of ethyl acrylate and other acrylates, in addition to small amounts (approximately 5 percent) of another compound containing a reactive halogen such as chlorine. Other acrylates used in the elastomers include n-butyl acrylate, 2-methoxyethyl acrylate, and 2-ethoxyethyl acrylate. These compounds impart good resistance to heat, ozone, sunlight, and oils. The acrylate monomers (small, single-unit molecules) are polymerized (linked together to form giant, multiple-unit molecules) by the action of free-radical catalysts, and the polymer chains are interlinked at the halogen sites, forming into an elastic network. Polyacrylate elastomers are mainly used for O-rings, seals, and gaskets.
