Secretin,  a digestive hormone secreted by the wall of the upper part of the small intestine (the duodenum) that regulates gastric acid secretion and pH levels in the duodenum. Secretin is a polypeptide made up of 27 amino acids. It was discovered in 1902 by British physiologists Sir William M. Bayliss and Ernest H. Starling. Bayliss and Starling placed dilute hydrochloric acid into a segment of a dog’s bowel from which the nerve supply had been severed. They then collected an extract of the bowel lining and injected it into another dog. The result was an increase in the secretion of pancreatic juice in the dog that received the injection. They named the material in the extract “secretin.” With this discovery emerged the concept that chemical messages could act at distant sites to regulate bodily functions.
When hydrochloric acid passes from the stomach into the duodenum, secretin is released into the bloodstream and stimulates the duct cells of the pancreas to secrete water and bicarbonate. By this mechanism, hydrochloric acid secreted by the stomach, which can be damaging to the intestinal lining, is promptly diluted and neutralized. Secretin also inhibits the secretion of gastrin, which triggers the initial release of hydrochloric acid into the stomach, and delays gastric emptying.
