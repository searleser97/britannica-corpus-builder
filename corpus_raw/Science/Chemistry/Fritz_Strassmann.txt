Fritz Strassmann,  (born Feb. 22, 1902, Boppard, Ger.—died  April 22, 1980, Mainz, W.Ger.), German physical chemist who, with Otto Hahn, discovered neutron-induced nuclear fission in uranium (1938) and thereby opened the field of atomic energy.
Strassmann received his Ph.D. from the Technical University in Hannover in 1929. He helped develop the rubidium-strontium method of dating widely used in geochronology. Beginning in 1934 he joined Hahn and Lise Meitner in their investigations of the radioactive products formed when uranium is bombarded by neutrons. Strassmann’s mastery of analytic chemistry contributed to the team’s recognition of the lighter elements produced from neutron bombardment, which were the result of the splitting of the uranium atom into two lighter atoms.
After serving briefly on the staffs of the Hannover and Kaiser Wilhelm institutes (destroyed in 1944), Strassmann in 1946 became professor of inorganic and nuclear chemistry at the University of Mainz, where he established the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry (later the Institute of Nuclear Chemistry). From 1945 to 1953 he was director of the chemistry department at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.
