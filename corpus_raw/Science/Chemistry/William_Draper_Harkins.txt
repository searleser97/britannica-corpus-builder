William Draper Harkins,  (born Dec. 28, 1873, Titusville, Pa., U.S.—died  March 7, 1951, Chicago), American chemist whose investigations of nuclear chemistry, particularly the structure of the nucleus, first revealed the basic process of nuclear fusion, the fundamental principle of the thermonuclear bomb.
Harkins received his Ph.D. (1908) from Stanford University, Calif., and taught chemistry at the University of Montana, Missoula, from 1900 to 1912. He spent the rest of his career at the University of Chicago.
Harkins predicted the existence of the neutron and heavy hydrogen (or deuterium) and introduced the concept of the packing fraction, a measure of the energy involved in the association of protons and neutrons within the nucleus of an atom. Utilizing Einstein’s concept of the equivalence of mass and energy, he demonstrated that by combining four hydrogen atoms to produce one helium atom, a small amount of mass would be converted to energy; he correctly theorized that this process was a source of stellar energy. Harkins made one of the first attempts to calculate the proportions of elements in the universe.
