Konrad E. Bloch, in full Konrad Emil Bloch,  (born January 21, 1912, Neisse, Germany [now Nysa, Poland]—died October 15, 2000, Burlington, Massachusetts, U.S.), German-born American biochemist who shared the 1964 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Feodor Lynen for their discoveries concerning the natural synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids.
After receiving a chemical engineering degree in 1934 at the Technische Hochschule in Munich, Bloch went to Switzerland and then to the United States. At Columbia University (where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1938) he became a research associate of Rudolf Schoenheimer in the isotopic analysis of cell metabolism. After teaching at the University of Chicago (1946–54), Bloch became professor of biochemistry at Harvard, continuing his research on lipids, especially the unsaturated fatty acid components; he was named professor emeritus in 1982. He wrote several books, including Blondes in Venetian Paintings, the Nine-Banded Armadillo, and Other Essays in Biochemistry (1994).
In 1942 Bloch and David Rittenberg discovered that the two-carbon compound acetic acid was the major building block in the 30 or more steps in the biosynthesis (natural formation) of cholesterol, a waxlike alcohol found in animal cells. In his search to determine how acetic acid molecules combine in this process, Bloch was also joined by Feodor Lynen and his collaborators in Munich and Sir John Warcup Cornforth and George Popják in England. Their discovery facilitated medical research on the relation of blood cholesterol levels to atherosclerosis, research in physiology, and research on the chemistry of terpenes, rubber, and other isoprene derivatives.
