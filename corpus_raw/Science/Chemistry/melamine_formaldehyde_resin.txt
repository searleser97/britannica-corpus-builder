Melamine-formaldehyde resin,  any of a class of synthetic resins obtained by chemical combination of melamine (a crystalline solid derived from urea) and formaldehyde (a highly reactive gas obtained from methane). A complex, interlinked polymer that cures to a clear, hard, chemically resistant resin, melamine formaldehyde is employed in plywood and particleboard adhesives, laminated countertops and tabletops, dishwasher-safe tableware, and automotive surface coatings. The chemical composition of melamine and formaldehyde and the reaction by which these two compounds are polymerized into a thermosetting network of interconnected molecules are described briefly in the article aldehyde condensation polymer.
Melamine-formaldehyde resin is similar to urea-formaldehyde resin in its processing and applications, but melamine resins are more moisture-resistant, harder, and stronger. Melamine moldings are glossy and one of the hardest plastics, and they retain a dust-free surface. These advantages led to the replacement of urea resins by melamine formaldehyde in molded plastic plates and food containers beginning in the 1950s. In addition, melamine formaldehyde is the principal resin employed in the decorative surface layer of laminated tabletop and countertop products such as Formica.
Melamine-based polymers have also been extensively employed as cross-linking agents in baked-on surface-coating systems. As such, they have had many industrial applicationsâ€”for instance, in automobile topcoats and in finishes for appliances and metal furniture. However, their use in coatings is decreasing because of restrictions on the emission of formaldehyde, a major component of these coatings.
