Francesco Selmi,  (born April 7, 1817, Vignola, duchy of Modena [Italy]—died  Aug. 13, 1881, Vignola), Italian chemist and toxicologist who is considered one of the founders of colloid chemistry.
Selmi held several teaching positions in Turin and Modena before accepting the post of professor of chemical pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Bologna in 1867. He published (1845–50) the first systematic study of inorganic colloids, in particular silver chloride, Prussian blue, and sulfur. His work in toxicology was mainly in the study of putrefaction and poisoning. In 1870 he coined the phrase “ptomaine poisoning.” Selmi’s Enciclopedia di chimica scientifica e industriale, 11 vol. (1868–81), was the first encyclopaedia of chemistry published in Italian.
