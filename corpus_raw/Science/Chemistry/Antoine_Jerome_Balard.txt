Antoine-Jérôme Balard,   (born Sept. 30, 1802, Montpellier, Fr.—died  March 30, 1876, Paris), French chemist who in 1826 discovered the element bromine, determined its properties, and studied some of its compounds. Later he proved the presence of bromine in sea plants and animals.
In studying salt marsh flora from Mediterranean waters, Balard, after crystallizing sodium chloride and sodium sulfate from the seawater, saturating the residue with chlorine, and distilling the product, discovered the only liquid nonmetallic element, bromine.
An exponent of the potential value of the sea as a source of chemicals, Balard taught at Montpellier École de Pharmacie, from which he had graduated in 1826. He became professor of chemistry at the Sorbonne (1842) and at the Collège de France, Paris (1851).
