Butyric acid (CH3CH2CH2CO2H), also called butanoic acid,  a fatty acid occurring in the form of esters in animal fats and plant oils. As a glyceride (an ester containing an acid and glycerol), it makes up 3–4 percent of butter; the disagreeable odour of rancid butter is that of hydrolysis of the butyric acid glyceride. The acid is of considerable commercial importance as a raw material in the manufacture of esters of lower alcohols for use as flavouring agents; its anhydride is used to make cellulose butyrate, a useful plastic. Butyric acid is manufactured by catalyzed air oxidation of butanal (butyraldehyde).

Butyric acid is a colourless liquid, soluble in water and miscible with common organic solvents; it freezes at −7.9 °C (17.8 °F) and boils at 163.5 °C (326.3 °F). An isomer, 2-methylpropanoic (isobutyric) acid, (CH3)2CHCO2H, is found both in the free state and as its ethyl ester in a few plant oils. Although it is commercially less important than butyric acid, it is generally similar to butyric acid; it freezes at −46.1 °C (−51 °F) and boils at 153.2 °C (307.8 °F).
