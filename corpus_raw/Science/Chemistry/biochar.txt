Biochar,  form of charcoal made from animal wastes and plant residues (such as wood chips, leaves, and husks) that undergo pyrolysis, a process that rapidly decomposes organic material through anaerobic heating. A technique practiced for many centuries by tribes of the Amazon Rainforest, the production of biochar is traditionally used in land-clearing activities and soil enrichment. Biochar is also useful for sequestering carbon by circumventing the normal decomposition process or acting as a fertilizer to enhance the sequestration rate of growing biomass. As a result, many scientists and environmentalists consider the production of biochar as a potential geoengineering technique.
In normal decomposition processes, as organic matter breaks down, the microbes acting upon the material use oxygen and release carbon dioxide (CO2). If, however, the material were “cooked” in the absence of oxygen, it would decompose rapidly through pyrolysis. In the process, little or no CO2 would be released, and the bulk of the organic material would harden into a kind of porous charcoal, essentially sequestering the carbon as a solid. Biochar mixed with soils might serve as a fertilizer, thus further increasing the carbon-sequestration potential of plants growing in the soil.
Some environmentalists see biochar as a breakthrough in carbon-sequestration technology, but its ability to reduce CO2 concentrations at global scales is a matter of some debate. Some scientists see problems in ramping up biochar production to global scales, since many farmers in poor countries would likely use the bulk of their available animal wastes and plant residues for cooking fires. Some scientists argue that without the development of financial incentives to produce biochar, it will not become a significant factor in removing CO2 from the atmosphere.
