Carbonate,   any member of two classes of chemical compounds derived from carbonic acid or carbon dioxide (q.v.). The inorganic carbonates are salts of carbonic acid (H2CO3), containing the carbonate ion, CO2/3-, and ions of metals such as sodium or calcium. Inorganic carbonates comprise many minerals (see carbonate mineral) and are the principal constituents of limestones and dolomites; they also comprise the hard parts of many marine invertebrates. Organic carbonates are esters; that is, compounds in which the hydrogen atoms of carbonic acid have been replaced by carbon-containing combining groups such as ethyl, C2H5.
