Cyclamate,  odourless white crystalline powder that is used as a nonnutritive sweetener. The name usually denotes either calcium cyclamate or sodium cyclamate, both of which are salts of cyclohexylsulfamic acid (C6H11NHSO3H). These compounds are stable to heat and are readily soluble in water. Cyclamates have a very sweet taste, with about 30 times the sweetening power of sucrose. They are used as sweeteners in baked goods, confections, desserts, soft drinks, preserves, and salad dressings. They are often combined with saccharin to produce a synergistic sweetening effect.
Cyclamates were discovered by Michael Sveda in 1937. They have no caloric value and are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However, a variable amount is hydrolyzed by bacteria in the intestinal tract to form cyclohexylamine, which is a potential carcinogen. Two scientific studies prior to 1970 linked cyclamates to the production of cancerous tumours in the bladders of rats. This led to an immediate ban on use of the compounds in many countries. Subsequent research, however, failed to establish convincing evidence of carcinogenic properties of cyclamates. This has led to reapproval of their use in many countries, though they remain banned in South Korea and the United States.
