Curium (Cm),  synthetic chemical element of the actinoid series of the periodic table, atomic number 96. Unknown in nature, curium (as the isotope curium-242) was discovered (summer 1944) at the University of Chicago by American chemists Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso in a sample of a plutonium isotope, plutonium-239, that had been bombarded by helium ions (alpha particles) in the 152-cm (60-inch) cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. It was the third transuranium element to be discovered. The element was named after French physicists Pierre and Marie Curie.
Curium is a silvery metal. All of its isotopes are radioactive. For chemical research, curium-242 (163-day half-life) has been supplanted by curium-244 (18.1-year half-life) and the still longer-lived isotope curium-248, which are built up from plutonium-239 by neutron irradiation. Curium exhibits its common +3 oxidation state as the very faint yellow Cm3+ ion in aqueous solution, as the sesquioxide Cm2O3, and as the trihalides; it is chemically similar to the other tripositive actinoid elements and to the lanthanoid elements. The +4 oxidation state appears in the black dioxide CmO2 and as the Cm4+ ion complexed with the fluoride ion.
