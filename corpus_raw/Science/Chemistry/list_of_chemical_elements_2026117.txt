 A chemical element is any substance that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances by ordinary chemical processes. Elements are the fundamental materials of which all matter is composed. Here, the elements are ordered alphabetically. Each element is followed by its atomic number, the total number of protons in the atomic nucleus. (See also periodic table of the elements.)
