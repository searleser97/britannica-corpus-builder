Picric acid, also called 2,4,6-trinitrophenol,  pale yellow, odourless crystalline solid that has been used as a military explosive, as a yellow dye, and as an antiseptic. Picric acid (from Greek pikros, “bitter”) was so named by the 19th-century French chemist Jean-Baptiste-André Dumas because of the extremely bitter taste of its yellow aqueous solution. Percussion or rapid heating can cause it (or its salts with heavy metals, such as copper, silver, or lead) to explode.
Picric acid was first obtained in 1771 by Peter Woulfe, a British chemist, by treating indigo with nitric acid. It was used as a yellow dye, initially for silk, beginning in 1849.
As an explosive, picric acid was formerly of great importance. The French began using it in 1886 as a bursting charge for shells under the name of melinite. By the time of the Russo-Japanese War, picric acid was the most widely used military explosive. Its highly corrosive action on the metal surfaces of shells was a disadvantage, however, and after World War I its use declined. Ammonium picrate, one of the salts of picric acid, is used in modern armour-piercing shells because it is insensitive enough to withstand the severe shock of penetration before detonating.
Picric acid has antiseptic and astringent properties. For medical use it is incorporated in a surface anesthetic ointment or solution and in burn ointments. 
Picric acid is a much stronger acid than phenol; it decomposes carbonates and may be titrated with bases. In a basic medium, lead acetate produces a bright yellow precipitate, lead picrate.
