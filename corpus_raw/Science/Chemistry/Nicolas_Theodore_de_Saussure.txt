Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure,  (born Oct. 14, 1767, Geneva, Switz.—died  April 18, 1845, Geneva), Swiss chemist and plant physiologist whose quantitative experiments on the influence of water, air, and nutrients on plants laid the foundation for plant biochemistry.
Saussure was the son of the geologist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, whom he assisted in a number of experiments and expeditions. Saussure’s work built on that of Joseph Priestley, his teacher Jean Senebier, and Jan Ingenhousz. In 1797 he published three articles on carbonic acid and its formation in plant tissues in the Annales de chimie (“Annals of Chemistry”). In Recherches chimiques sur la végétation (1804; “Chemical Research on Vegetation”), Saussure proved Steven Hales’s theory that plants absorb water and carbon dioxide in sunlight and increase in weight. He was thus one of the major founders in the study of photosynthesis. He further demonstrated that plants are dependent upon the absorption of nitrogen from soil. Beginning in 1808 Saussure published a series of important articles that chiefly analyzed biochemical reactions in plant cells. He received numerous awards and, by 1825, was an associate member of almost all the European academies.
