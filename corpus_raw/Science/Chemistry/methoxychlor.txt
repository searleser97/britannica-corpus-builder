Methoxychlor, also called 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-methoxyphenyl)ethane,  a colourless, crystalline organic halogen compound used as an insecticide. Methoxychlor is very similar to DDT but acts more rapidly, is less persistent, and does not accumulate in the fatty tissues of animals as does DDT.
Methoxychlor is prepared by the reaction of chloral with anisole (methyl phenyl ether) in the presence of sulfuric acid; the commercial product usually is about 88 percent pure.
