 Second only to PE in production and consumption, PVC is manufactured by bulk, solution, suspension, and emulsion polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer, using free-radical initiators. Vinyl chloride (CH2=CHCl) is most often obtained by reacting ethylene with oxygen and hydrogen chloride over a… 
…(where X is Cl) gives polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, more than 27 million metric tons of which is used globally each year to produce pipes, floor tiles, siding for houses, gutters, and downspouts. Polymerization of styrene, X = C6H5 (a phenyl group derived from benzene; see below Aromatic hydrocarbons), yields…
…chloride for the production of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. The conversion of ethylene chloride to vinyl chloride is carried out at temperatures of about 500 °C (930 °F) in the presence of a catalyst.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), for instance, is often mixed with nonvolatile liquids for this reason. Vinyl siding used on homes requires an unplasticized, rigid PVC with a Tg of 85 to 90 °C (185 to 195 °F). A PVC garden hose, on the other hand, should…
…polymers, the annual production of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, is second only to that of polyethylene.
…for his discovery of plasticized  polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
Polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, provided another versatile material for hose makers. The discovery of polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE, produced a plastic with outstanding resistance to most chemicals. Methods have also been developed for producing flexible metal hose and combinations of metal and synthetic fibres, e.g., a…
…pipes for water; use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe for sewers; use of “pigs” to clean the interior of pipelines and to perform other duties; “batching” of different petroleum products in a common pipeline; application of cathodic protection to reduce corrosion and extend pipeline life; use of space-age technologies such…
