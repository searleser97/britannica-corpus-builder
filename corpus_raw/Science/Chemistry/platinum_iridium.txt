Platinum–iridium,  alloy of platinum containing from 1 to 30 percent iridium, used for jewelry and surgical pins. A readily worked alloy, platinum–iridium is much harder, stiffer, and more resistant to chemicals than pure platinum, which is relatively soft.
Platinum–iridium is also very resistant to high-temperature electric sparks and is widely used for electrical contacts and sparking points.
The former international standard for the metre of length and the ones still in use for the kilogram of mass were constructed from the alloy containing 90 percent platinum and 10 percent iridium.
