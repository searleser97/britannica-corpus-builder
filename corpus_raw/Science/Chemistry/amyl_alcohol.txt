Amyl alcohol, also called Pentyl Alcohol,  any of eight organic compounds having the same molecular formula, C5H11OH, but different structures. The term is commonly applied to mixtures of these compounds, which are used as solvents for resins and oily materials and in the manufacture of other chemicals, especially amyl acetate, a solvent for nitrocellulose lacquers. Commercial amyl alcohols are colourless liquids, slightly soluble in water, and having a characteristic penetrating odour.
Before the 1920s, the only economical source of amyl alcohol was fusel oil, which is formed as a minor product in the fermentation of carbohydrates to make ethyl alcohol. More abundant and dependable production results from two industrial syntheses that employ hydrocarbons available from petroleum. In the first of these methods, introduced in 1926, the chlorination of pentane gives mixed amyl chlorides that are converted to the desired alcohols by reaction with water and caustic alkali. A second process, introduced in 1953, is based on the reaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen with butene.
