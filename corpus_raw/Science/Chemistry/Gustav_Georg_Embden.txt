Gustav Georg Embden,  (born Nov. 10, 1874, Hamburg—died  July 25, 1933, Nassau, Ger.), German physiological chemist who conducted studies on the chemistry of carbohydrate metabolism and muscle contraction and was the first to discover and link together all the steps involved in the conversion of glycogen to lactic acid.
Embden studied in Freiburg, Strasbourg, Munich, Berlin, and Zürich under the direction of noted physiologists of the day—Johannes von Vries, Franz Hofmeister, Gaule, Paul Ehrlich, and Julius Richard Ewald. In 1904 he became director of the chemistry laboratory of the medical clinic at the Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen municipal hospital.
His research built the clinic into the Physiological Institute by 1907 and into the University Institute for Vegetative Physiology in 1914, the year in which the University of Frankfurt am Main was founded. He retained his directorship, served as a professor at the university, and was rector of the university from 1925 to 1926. His studies in the newly developing field of physiological chemistry were primarily concerned with chemical processes in living organisms, especially intermediate metabolic processes in liver tissue. By developing a technique to prevent tissue damage, he discovered the important role of the liver in metabolism and did preliminary studies that led to the investigation of normal sugar metabolism and of its pathological form, diabetes.
Embden and his co-workers isolated several intermediate metabolic products from muscle tissue and discovered the important metabolic compound adenyl phosphoric acid, which is more commonly known as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In all his work he emphasized the relationships between his results and general cellular processes.
