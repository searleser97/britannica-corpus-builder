Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF),  a synthetic resin produced by the polymerization of vinylidene fluoride (CH2=CF2). A tough plastic that is resistant to flame, electricity, and attack by most chemicals, PVDF is injection-molded into bottles for the chemical industry and extruded as a film for electrical insulation. Its flame resistance makes it especially desirable for insulating wire in buildings and aircraft. PVDF is also piezoelectric, changing its electrical charge in response to pressure and, conversely, exerting pressure in response to an applied electric field. This unique property makes it a good material for transducers in devices such as headphones, microphones, and sonic detectors.
