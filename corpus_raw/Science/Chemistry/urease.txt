Urease,   an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea, forming ammonia and carbon dioxide. Found in large quantities in jack beans, soybeans, and other plant seeds, it also occurs in some animal tissues and intestinal microorganisms. Urease is significant in the history of enzymology as the first enzyme to be purified and crystallized (by James B. Sumner in 1926). This achievement laid the groundwork for the subsequent demonstration that urease and other enzymes are proteins.
