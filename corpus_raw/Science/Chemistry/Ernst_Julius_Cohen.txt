Ernst Julius Cohen,  (born March 7, 1869, Amsterdam, Neth.—died c. March 5, 1944, Auschwitz [now Oświęcim], Pol.), Dutch chemist noted for his extensive work on the allotropy of metals, particularly tin, and for his research in piezochemistry and electrochemical thermodynamics.
Cohen was educated under J.H. van’t Hoff at the University of Amsterdam (Ph.D., 1893) and worked in Paris with Henri Moissan before returning to teach chemistry in Amsterdam. In 1902 he moved to the University of Utrecht as director of a chemical laboratory. Cohen helped discover the two allotropes of tin (white tin and gray tin) and determined their differing properties. He lectured throughout Europe and the United States and published numerous works on his experimental research as well as medical textbooks and historical articles on the lives of influential research chemists. Cohen retired from teaching in 1939 but continued his studies until his arrest by the Nazi occupation forces in 1944. He died in the Auschwitz death camp.
