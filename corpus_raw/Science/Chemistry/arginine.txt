arginine,  an amino acid obtainable by hydrolysis of many common proteins but particularly abundant in protamines and histones, proteins associated with nucleic acids. First isolated from animal horn (1895), arginine plays an important role in mammals in the synthesis of urea, the principal form in which these species excrete nitrogen. Arginine is one of several nonessential amino acids for adult mammals; i.e., they can synthesize it from glutamic acid and do not require dietary sources. The chemical structure of arginine is
