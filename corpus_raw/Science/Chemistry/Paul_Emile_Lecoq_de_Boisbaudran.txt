Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran,  (born April 18, 1838, Cognac, Fr.—died  May 28, 1912, Paris), French chemist who developed improved spectroscopic techniques for chemical analysis and discovered the elements gallium (1875), samarium (1880), and dysprosium (1886).
In 1858 Lecoq de Boisbaudran began working in the family wine business, though he pursued scientific studies in his spare time. He took up the study of spectroscopic analysis and began a search for new elements in 1859. In 1869 Mendeleyev published his periodic table, from which he predicted the existence and properties of several unknown elements, including one he called eka-aluminum. When Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered gallium, he found it had the predicted properties of eka-aluminum, and thus it was the first of Mendeleyev’s elements to be uncovered. His discovery paved the way for the general acceptance of the periodic table.
