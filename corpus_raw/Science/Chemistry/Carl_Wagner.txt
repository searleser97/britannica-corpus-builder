Carl Wagner,  (born May 25, 1901, Leipzig, Ger.—died  Dec. 10, 1977, Göttingen, W.Ger.), German physical chemist and metallurgist who helped advance the understanding of the chemistry of solid-state materials, especially the effects of imperfections at the atomic level on the properties of compounds such as oxides and sulfides, and of metals and alloys.
Wagner was educated at the universities of Munich and Leipzig and taught and carried out research in a number of German universities. He was a member of the faculty of metallurgy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, from 1949 to 1958, and from 1958 to 1968 he was director of the Max Planck Institute of Chemistry in Göttingen. His early work on defect structures in solids was important to the development of semiconductor materials.
