Repression,   in metabolism, a control mechanism in which a protein molecule, called a repressor, prevents the synthesis of an enzyme by binding to—and thereby impeding the action of—the deoxyribonucleic acid that controls the process by which the enzyme is synthesized. Although the process has been most-studied in microorganisms, it is believed to occur in a similar way in higher organisms. See also induction.
