Johann Joachim Becher,  (born May 6, 1635, Speyer, Bishopric of Speyer—died  October 1682/85, England), chemist, physician, and adventurer whose theories of combustion influenced Georg Stahl’s phlogiston theory. Becher believed substances to be composed of three earths, the vitrifiable, the mercurial, and the combustible. He supposed that when a substance burned, a combustible earth was liberated.
During his youth, study was difficult because he had to support his mother and brothers, but at 19 he began an extraordinary career that alternated learned publication with colonization and trade enterprises. His ideas and experiments on the nature of minerals and other substances were set forth in Subterranean Physics (1669). At Munich he suggested that the elector of Bavaria establish South American colonies and a cloth-trade monopoly, but angry merchants forced him to flee. At Vienna he proposed a Rhine–Danube canal and was also employed in experiments to transmute Danube sand into gold. He fell into disgrace and fled the country.
