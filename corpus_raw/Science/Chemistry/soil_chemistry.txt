Soil chemistry,   discipline embracing all chemical and mineralogical compounds and reactions occurring in soils and soil-forming processes. The goals of soil chemistry are: (1) to establish, through chemical analysis, compositional limits of natural soil types and optimal growth conditions for the various plant communities, (2) to derive principles governing development of soil profiles, and (3) to apply analytical and theoretical knowledge to the improvement of agricultural production. See also pedology.
