Benzyl alcohol,   an organic compound, of molecular formula C6H5CH2OH, that occurs combined with carboxylic acids (as esters) in balsams and oils of jasmine and other flowers. Several of its natural and synthetic esters have long been used in perfumery; the alcohol itself has become important in the second half of the 20th century as a developer booster in the processing of colour motion-picture film and as a dyeing assistant for filament nylons. Benzyl alcohol is manufactured by the hydrolysis of benzyl chloride in the presence of soda ash.
