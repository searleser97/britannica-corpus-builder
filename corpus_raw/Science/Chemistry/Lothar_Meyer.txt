Lothar Meyer,  (born Aug. 19, 1830, Varel, Oldenburg [Germany]—died  April 11, 1895, Tübingen), German chemist who, independently of Dmitry Mendeleyev, developed a periodic classification of the chemical elements. Though originally educated as a physician, he was chiefly interested in chemistry and physics.
In 1859 Meyer began his career as a science educator, holding various appointments before serving as professor of chemistry at the University of Tübingen (1876–95). His book Die modernen Theorien der Chemie (1864; “Modern Chemical Theory”), a lucid treatise on the fundamental principles of chemical science, contained a preliminary scheme for the arrangement of elements by atomic weight and discussed the relation between the atomic weights and the properties of the elements. This influential work was often enlarged and went into many editions. In about 1868 Meyer prepared an expanded table, similar in many ways to Mendeleyev’s table published in 1869. It was not until 1870, however, that Meyer published his own table, a graph relating atomic volume and atomic number and clearly showing the periodic relationships of the elements. He did not claim priority for his achievement, and he admitted that he had been reluctant to predict the existence of undiscovered elements as Mendeleyev had done.
Meyer worked in several areas of chemistry, but much of his activity grew out of his preoccupation with the classification of the elements. He worked on recalculating a number of atomic weights and made use of the periodic table for predicting and studying related elements’ chemical properties.
