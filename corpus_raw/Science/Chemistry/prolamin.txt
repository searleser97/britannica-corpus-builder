Prolamin,   any of certain seed proteins known as globulins that are insoluble in water but soluble in water-ethanol mixtures. Prolamins contain large amounts of the amino acids proline and glutamine (from which the name prolamin is derived) but only small amounts of arginine, lysine, and histidine. Gliadin from wheat contains 14 percent by weight of proline, 45 percent of glutamine, and very little lysine. Hordein is the prolamin from barley; zein is that from corn.
The term glutelin is used for seed globulins that are insoluble in water but soluble in acidified or alkaline solutions. Both prolamins and glutelins are mixtures of several similar proteins.
