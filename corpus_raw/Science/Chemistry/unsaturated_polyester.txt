Unsaturated polyester,  any of a group of thermosetting resins produced by dissolving a low-molecular-weight unsaturated polyester in a vinyl monomer and then copolymerizing the two to form a hard, durable plastic material. Unsaturated polyesters, usually strengthened by fibreglass or ground mineral, are made into structural parts such as boat hulls, pipes, and countertops.
Unsaturated polyesters are copolyestersâ€”that is, polyesters prepared from a saturated dicarboxylic acid or its anhydride (usually phthalic anhydride) as well as an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid or anhydride (usually maleic anhydride). These two acid constituents are reacted with one or more dialcohols, such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, to produce the characteristic ester groups that link the precursor molecules together into long, chainlike, multiple-unit polyester molecules. The maleic anhydride units of this copolyester are unsaturated because they contain carbon-carbon double bonds that are capable of undergoing further polymerization under the proper conditions. These conditions are created when the copolyester is dissolved in a monomer such as styrene and the two are subjected to the action of free-radical initiators. The mixture, at this point usually poured into a mold, then copolymerizes rapidly to form a three-dimensional network structure that bonds well with fibres or other reinforcing materials. The principal products are boat hulls, appliances, business machines, automobile parts, automobile-body patching compounds, tubs and shower stalls, flooring, translucent paneling, storage tanks, corrosion-resistant ducting, and building components. Unsaturated polyesters filled with ground limestone or other minerals are cast into kitchen countertops and bathroom vanities. Bowling balls are made from unsaturated polyesters cast into molds with no reinforcement.
