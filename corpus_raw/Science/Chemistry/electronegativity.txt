Electronegativity,   in chemistry, the ability of an atom to attract to itself an electron pair shared with another atom in a chemical bond.
The commonly used measure of the electronegativities of chemical elements is the electronegativity scale derived by Linus Pauling in 1932. In it the elements are tabulated in decreasing order of electronegativity, fluorine being the most electronegative and cesium the least. The scale was derived from a comparison of the energies associated with chemical bonds between various combinations of atoms. A scale very similar to Paulingâ€™s values has been obtained by measurements of atomic ionization potentials and electron affinities.
Elements differing greatly in electronegativity tend to form ionic compounds, composed of positively and negatively charged units called ions; those differing moderately in electronegativity form polar, covalent compounds, in which atoms are held together by chemical bonds but which show some degree of ionization, while those elements with approximately equal electronegativities form nonpolar compounds, which show little charge separation.
