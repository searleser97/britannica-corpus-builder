Fritz Pregl,  (born Sept. 3, 1869, Laibach, Austria-Hungary [now Ljubljana, Slovenia]—died Dec. 13, 1930, Graz, Austria), Austrian chemist awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for developing techniques in the microanalysis of organic compounds.
Pregl received a medical degree from the University of Graz (1894), where he was associated for most of his professional life with the Medico-Chemical Institute. About 1905 he began researches on bile acids and other substances. The difficulty of obtaining these materials in quantities sufficient for the use of conventional analytic techniques impelled him to devise new analytic methods. By 1912 he was able to make reliable measurements of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur with only 5–13 mg of starting material, and he later refined his methods to allow measurements with 3–5 mg. His breakthrough eventually enabled scientists to begin work with tenths of milligrams of material. Pregl also developed a sensitive microbalance, invented micromethods for determining the functional groups of organic compounds, and devised a simple method for determining the functional capacities of kidneys.
