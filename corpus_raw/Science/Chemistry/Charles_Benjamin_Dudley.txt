Charles Benjamin Dudley,  (born July 14, 1842, Oxford, N.Y., U.S.—died  Dec. 21, 1909, Altoona, Pa.), American chemical engineer who helped found the science of materials testing.
Entering Yale College in 1867, Dudley worked his way through school as a night editor on the New Haven Palladium and eventually earned his Ph.D. from the Sheffield Scientific School, as well as election to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1875 he was appointed chemist to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, where he instituted a program of research on the composition and properties of rails.
The publication of Dudley’s study “The Chemical Composition and Physical Properties of Steel Rails” in the Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers (1878) created a sensation. The steel producers viewed with disfavour the invasion of their metallurgical domain by an outsider; but Dudley continued to publish his findings, and the principle he stood for, the enforcement of rigorous standards, prevailed. Eventually he developed a complete set of standard specifications for fuels, lubricants, paints, and lighting devices, as well as for mechanical components of locomotives and rolling stock. In 1898 he helped found the American Society for Testing and Materials, serving as president from 1902 until his death.
