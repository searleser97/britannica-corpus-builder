Frederic Stanley Kipping,  (born Aug. 16, 1863, Manchester, Eng.â€”died  May 1, 1949, Criccieth, Caernarvonshire, Wales), British chemist who pioneered in the chemistry of silicones, organic derivatives of silicon.
Kipping became chief demonstrator in chemistry at the City and Guilds of London Institute in 1890 and seven years later was appointed professor of chemistry at University College, Nottingham. His research on optically active compounds led him to study organic silicon compounds from 1900. His findings were published in a series of 51 papers. Because of their exceptional water resistance and high temperature stability, silicones eventually found nearly universal applications as synthetic rubber, water repellents, hydraulic fluids, and greases.
