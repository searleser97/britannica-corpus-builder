Ethanolamine,   the first of three organic compounds that can be derived from ammonia by successively replacing the hydrogen atoms with hydroxyethyl radicals (â€•CH2CH2OH), the others being diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The three are widely used in industry, principally as absorbents for acidic components (e.g., carbon dioxide) of natural gas and of petroleum-refinery gas streams. As salts (soaps) with fatty acids, they are used as emulsifiers in numerous household and industrial products. Triethanolamine is a corrosion inhibitor for automobile antifreeze solutions and airplane-engine coolants. The ethanolamines are commercially prepared by the reaction of ammonia and ethylene oxide.
