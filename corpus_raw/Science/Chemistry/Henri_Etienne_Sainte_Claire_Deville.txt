Henri-Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville,  (born March 11, 1818, St. Thomas, Danish Virgin Islands—died  July 1, 1881, Boulogne, France), French chemical researcher who invented the first economical process for producing aluminum.
Sainte-Claire Deville was the son of a French diplomat. He received a degree in medicine in Paris in 1843 but was already attracted to chemistry. He established his own laboratory and published a paper on his turpentine researches, winning a doctorate in science. As professor of chemistry and dean of science at the University of Besançon from 1845 to 1851, he proved exceptionally capable of combining research with teaching. In 1851 he was appointed professor of chemistry at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, and in 1859 he became professor of chemistry at the Sorbonne, where he taught for the remainder of his life. In the 1850s and ’60s he trained a number of students who became outstanding chemists.
As early as 1849 Sainte-Claire Deville made the important research contribution of synthesizing nitrogen pentoxide, which turned his attention to inorganic chemistry. Within a few years he worked out a process for obtaining pure aluminum from its compounds by treating them with sodium instead of the expensive potassium; the Deville process made aluminum a commercial metal for the first time. He also made important contributions to the study of the metallurgy of platinum and other minerals.
