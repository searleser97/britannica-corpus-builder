Renin,  enzyme secreted by the kidney (and also, possibly, by the placenta) that is part of a physiological system that regulates blood pressure. In the blood, renin acts on a protein known as angiotensinogen, resulting in the release of angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme, splitting off two amino acids from the 10-amino-acid chain of angiotensin I, to form angiotensin II. The resultant angiotensin II octapeptide (previously called hypertensin, or angiotonin) acts via receptors to constrict arterioles, causing a rise in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Angiotensin II is one of the most active vasoconstrictors known; on a weight basis it is significantly more potent than norepinephrine. It also increases the secretion of cortisol and aldosterone by a direct action on the adrenal cortex. Renin was discovered in 1898 by Robert Tigerstedt and Per Bergman, researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. See also renin-angiotensin system.
