Law of mass action,  law stating that the rate of any chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the masses of the reacting substances, with each mass raised to a power equal to the coefficient that occurs in the chemical equation. This law was formulated over the period 1864â€“79 by the Norwegian scientists Cato M. Guldberg and Peter Waage but is now of only historical interest. This law was useful for obtaining the correct equilibrium equation for a reaction, but the rate expressions it provides are now known to apply only to elementary reactions. (See chemical kinetics.)
