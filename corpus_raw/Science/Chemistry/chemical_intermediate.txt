Chemical intermediate,   any chemical substance produced during the conversion of some reactant to a product. Most synthetic processes involve transformation of some readily available and often inexpensive substance to some desired product through a succession of steps. All the substances generated by one step and used for the succeeding step are considered intermediates.
Apart from substances that can be recovered as products if the reaction is stopped at the point of generation of the intermediate, unstable molecules, some chemical substances are either known or hypothesized to be intermediate, even if they have not yet been isolated. Among the classes of generally unstable intermediates that are well studied are free radicals, carbenes, carbonium ions, and carbanions. These intermediates are highly reactive fragments of molecules that ordinarily remain uncombined for only very short periods of time.
