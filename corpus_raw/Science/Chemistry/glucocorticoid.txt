Glucocorticoid,  any steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal gland and known particularly for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions.
The adrenal gland is an organ situated on top of the kidney. It consists of an outer cortex (adrenal cortex) and an inner medulla (adrenal medulla). The hormones secreted from the cortex are steroids, generally classified as glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone, which causes sodium retention and potassium excretion by the kidney). Those substances emanating from the medulla are amines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine.
Glucocorticoids together with mineralocorticoids are used in replacement therapy in acute or chronic adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). Glucocorticoids, including a range of synthetic analogs (e.g., prednisolone, triamcinolone, and dexamethasone), are also used as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant agents. As anti-inflammatory agents, they are used in the treatment of bronchial asthma. Glucocorticoids indirectly inhibit the activity of phospholipase A2, an enzyme that plays an essential role in the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes; its inhibition by lipocortin-1 underlies part of the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also reduce the synthesis of some proteins that directly mediate the inflammatory response.
