Superheated steam,  water vapour at a temperature higher than the boiling point of water at a particular pressure. For example, at normal atmospheric pressure, superheated steam has a temperature above 100 °C (212 °F). Use of superheated steam permits more efficient operation of devices that convert heat into mechanical work.
