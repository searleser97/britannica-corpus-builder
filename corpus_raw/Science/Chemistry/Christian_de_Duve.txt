Christian René de Duve,  (born October 2, 1917, Thames Ditton, Surrey, England—died May 4, 2013, Nethen, Belgium), Belgian cytologist and biochemist who discovered lysosomes (the digestive organelles of the cell) and peroxisomes (organelles that are the site of metabolic processes involving hydrogen peroxide). For this work he shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1974 with Albert Claude and George Palade.
De Duve’s discovery of lysosomes arose out of his research on the enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates by the liver. While using Claude’s technique of separating the components of cells by spinning them in a centrifuge, he noticed that the cells’ release of an enzyme called acid phosphatase increased in proportion to the amount of damage done to the cells during centrifugation. De Duve reasoned that the acid phosphatase was enclosed within the cell in some kind of membranous envelope that formed a self-contained organelle. He calculated the probable size of this organelle, christened it the lysosome, and later identified it in electron microscope pictures. De Duve’s discovery of lysosomes answered the question of how the powerful enzymes used by cells to digest nutrients are kept separate from other cell components.
In 1947 de Duve joined the faculty of the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain) in Belgium, where he had received an M.D. in 1941 and a master’s degree in chemistry in 1946. From 1962 he simultaneously headed research laboratories at Leuven, where he became emeritus professor in 1985, and at Rockefeller University, New York City, where he was named emeritus professor in 1988. De Duve also founded the International Institute of Cellular and Molecular Pathology (ICP) in 1974, which was renamed the Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology in 1997.
