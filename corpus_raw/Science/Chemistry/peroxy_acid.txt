Peroxy acid, also called Peracid,  any of a class of chemical compounds in which the atomic group ―O―O―H replaces the ―O―H group of an oxy acid (a compound in which a hydrogen atom is attached to an oxygen atom by a covalent bond that is easily broken, producing an anion and a hydrogen ion). Examples of peroxy acids are peroxyacetic acid (CH3CO―OOH, related to acetic acid, CH3CO―OH) and peroxysulfuric acid (HOSO2―OOH, or H2SO5, analogous to sulfuric acid, HOSO2―OH, or H2SO4).
Peroxy acids usually are prepared by reaction of the oxy acid with hydrogen peroxide; small amounts of sulfuric or other strong acids often are used to accelerate the reaction of weak oxy acids. The peroxy acids are used primarily as oxidizing agents; they readily add oxygen to alkenes to give epoxides and are used to convert ketones to esters and amines to nitro compounds, amine oxides, or nitroso compounds.
