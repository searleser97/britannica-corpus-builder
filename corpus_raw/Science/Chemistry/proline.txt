proline,  an amino acid obtained by hydrolysis of proteins. Its molecule contains a secondary amino group (>NH) rather than the primary amino group (>NH2) characteristic of most amino acids. Unlike other amino acids, proline, first isolated from casein (1901), is readily soluble in alcohol. Collagen, the principal protein of connective tissue, yields about 15 percent proline. It is one of several so-called nonessential amino acids; i.e., animals can synthesize it from glutamic acid and do not require dietary sources. The chemical structure of proline is
