Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO),  the simplest representative of the aromatic aldehydes, occurring naturally as the glycoside amygdalin. Prepared synthetically, it is used chiefly in the manufacture of dyes, cinnamic acid, and other organic compounds, and to some extent in perfumes and flavouring agents.
Benzaldehyde was first isolated in 1803, and in the 1830s the German chemists Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler investigated the compound in studies that laid the foundation for the structural theory of organic chemistry. Industrially, benzaldehyde is made by a process in which toluene is treated with chlorine to form benzal chloride, followed by treatment of benzal chloride with water.

Benzaldehyde is readily oxidized to benzoic acid and is converted to addition products by hydrocyanic acid or sodium bisulfite. It undergoes simultaneous oxidation and reduction with alcoholic potassium hydroxide (a Cannizzaro reaction), giving potassium benzoate and benzyl alcohol; with alcoholic potassium cyanide, it is converted to benzoin; with anhydrous sodium acetate and acetic anhydride, it gives cinnamic acid.
Benzaldehyde is a colourless liquid with an odour of almond oil. It has a melting point of −26 °C (−14.8 °F) and a boiling point of 179 °C (354.2 °F). It is only slightly soluble in water and is completely soluble in ethanol and diethyl ether.
