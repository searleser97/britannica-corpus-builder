Polysulfone,   any of a class of resinous organic chemical compounds belonging to the family of polymers in which the main structural chain most commonly consists of benzene rings linked together by sulfonyl (―SO2―), ether (―O―), and isopropylidene (―C(CH3)2―) groups.
The polysulfone resins, introduced in the 1960s, are tough, strong, stiff, and resistant to decomposition by heat or chemical attack. They retain their mechanical properties over a wide temperature range (−70° to 150° C, or about −95° to 300° F) and are used as wire coatings, for fabricating household and plumbing items, and for automotive parts.
