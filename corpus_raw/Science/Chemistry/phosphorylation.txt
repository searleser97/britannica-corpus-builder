Phosphorylation,   in chemistry, the addition of a phosphoryl group (PO32-) to an organic compound. The process by which much of the energy in foods is conserved and made available to the cell is called oxidative phosphorylation (see cellular respiration). The process by which green plants convert light energy to chemical energy is called photophosphorylation (see photosynthesis).
