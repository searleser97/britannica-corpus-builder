Gerhard Ertl,  (born October 10, 1936, Bad Cannstatt, Germany), German chemist, who received the 2007 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his pioneering work in the discipline of surface chemistry.
Ertl studied at the Technical University of Stuttgart (now Stuttgart University; M.A., 1961), the University of Paris, and the Technical University of Munich (Ph.D., 1965). He served as director of the physical chemistry departments at the Technical University of Hannover (1968–73) and the University of Munich (1973–86). During this period he also toured the United States as a visiting professor. He became director of the department of physical chemistry at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin in 1986, and he served in that capacity until he was named professor emeritus in 2004.
Ertl’s prize-winning work focused on surface chemistry. His experimental methods added a level of precision that was previously unobtainable when studying the reactions between gases and solid surfaces. By using vacuum technology developed for the semiconductor industry, he was able to refine the Haber-Bosch process for synthesizing ammonia. His methods had both experimental and commercial applications, ranging from the study of the mechanics of ozone depletion to the improvment of the performance of hydrogen fuel cells.
