Californium (Cf),  synthetic chemical element of the actinoid series of the periodic table, atomic number 98. Not occurring in nature, californium (as the isotope californium-245) was discovered (1950) by American chemists Stanley G. Thompson, Kenneth Street, Jr., Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg at the University of California, Berkeley, as a product resulting from the helium-ion bombardment of curium-242 (atomic number 96) in the 152-cm (60-inch) cyclotron, followed by chemical separation from other elements by chromatography. The element was named after the state of California, where it was discovered.
All californium isotopes are radioactive; the long-lived isotopes are produced from berkelium-249 or from californium-249. They are californium-249 (351-year half-life), californium-250 (13-year half-life), californium-251 (898-year half-life), and californium-252 (2.645-year half-life). The isotope californium-249 has been used in tracer levels and microgram amounts to investigate the chemistry of californium (which exhibits an oxidation state of +3 in aqueous solution) and for preparing microgram quantities of compounds such as the oxychloride CfOCl, the oxides Cf2O3 and CfO2, and the trichloride CfCl3. The dihalides CfCl2, CfBr2, and CfI2 have been made. There is also some evidence from electrochemical studies in solutions for a +2 state. Metallic californium has been prepared and is structurally similar to metallic americium, curium, berkelium, and most lanthanoid metals.
Californium-252, because 3 percent of its decay occurs by spontaneous fission, is industrially and medically important as a very intense source of neutrons. One microgram releases 170,000,000 neutrons per minute.
