Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH),  a large peptide hormone that exists in several forms that differ from one another only in the number of amino acids, which can vary from 37 to 44. Unlike other neurohormones (substances produced by specialized cells typical of the nervous system), GHRH is not widely distributed throughout the brain and is found only in the hypothalamus. The secretion of GHRH increases in response to physical and emotional stress, and its secretion is blocked by a powerful hypothalamic neurohormone called somatostatin. The secretion of GHRH is also inhibited by insulin-like growth factors, which are generated when tissues are exposed to growth hormone itself.
Ghrelin, a 28-amino-acid peptide, is a hypothalamic substance that acts synergistically with GHRH to increase growth hormone secretion. Ghrelin may also stimulate the secretion of GHRH and inhibit the secretion of somatostatin. The physiologic role of ghrelin in the regulation of growth hormone secretion is not known.
