Paul-Louis-Toussaint Héroult,  (born April 10, 1863, Thury-Harcourt, Fr.—died  May 9, 1914, near Antibes), French chemist who invented the electric-arc furnace—widely used in making steel—and, independently of the simultaneous work of Charles M. Hall of the United States, devised the electrolytic process for preparing aluminum. This process made low-priced aluminum available for the first time, securing the widespread use of the metal and its alloys.
While a student at the École des Mines, Paris, Héroult began working on the electrolysis of aluminum compounds. In 1886 he found that electrolysis of a solution of alumina (aluminum oxide) in molten cryolite (sodium aluminum fluoride) resulted in the formation of a layer of molten aluminum at the bottom of the vessel. The Héroult process is essentially identical to the one discovered by Hall in the same year. After prolonged patent litigation, an agreement was reached between the two inventors.
Héroult is also noted for the Héroult electric furnace named for him, which found widespread use in the manufacture of aluminum and ferroalloys, first in Europe and later throughout the world.
