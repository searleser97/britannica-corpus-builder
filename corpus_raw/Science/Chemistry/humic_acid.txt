Humic acid,  one of two classes of natural acidic organic polymer that can be extracted from humus found in soil, sediment, or aquatic environments. The process by which humic acid forms in humus is not well understood, but the consensus is that it accumulates gradually as a residue from the metabolism of microorganisms. Its structure is unlike that of proteins or carbohydrates, the two most common organic polymers found in biological material; instead, humic acid can be characterized as a loose assembly of aromatic polymers of varying acidity and reactivity.
Humic acid has the average chemical formula C187H186O89N9S1 and is insoluble in strong acid (pH = 1). A 1:1 hydrogen-to-carbon ratio indicates a significant degree of aromatic character (i.e., the presence of benzene rings in the structure), whereas a low oxygen-to-carbon ratio indicates fewer acidic functional groups than occur in fulvic acid, the other acidic organic polymer that can be extracted from humus. Transition and heavy metals—for example, Fe3+ or Pb2+—as well as other compounds having aromatic or hydrophobic (water-insoluble) chemical structures (i.e., organic pesticides or anthropogenic hydrocarbons), react strongly with humic acid. This property makes it an effective agent in sequestering many of the pollutants in terrestrial and aquatic environments.
