Trinitrotoluene (TNT),  a pale yellow, solid organic nitrogen compound used chiefly as an explosive, prepared by stepwise nitration of toluene. Because TNT melts at 82째 C (178째 F) and does not explode below 240째 C (464째 F), it can be melted in steam-heated vessels and poured into casings. It is relatively insensitive to shock and cannot be exploded without a detonator. For these reasons it is the most favoured chemical explosive, extensively used in munitions and for demolitions.
