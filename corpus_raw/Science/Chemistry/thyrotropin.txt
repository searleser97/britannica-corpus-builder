Thyrotropin, also called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),  substance produced by cells called thyrotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland.
Thyrotropin binds to specific receptors on the surface of cells in the thyroid gland. This binding stimulates the breakdown of thyroglobulin (a large protein that is cleaved to form the thyroid hormones and that is stored within the follicles of the thyroid gland). The result is the secretion of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) into the circulation. Thyrotropin also stimulates the synthesis of additional thyroglobulin and thyroid hormone and the growth of thyroid cells. Thyrotropin is secreted by the pituitary gland upon the command of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). When thyrotropin causes the manufacture and secretion of excess thyroid hormone, the secreted hormone can travel to the pituitary gland and act on receptors that slow down the release of thyrotropin and hence TRH. This negative feedback contributes to the bodyâ€™s ability to maintain appropriate levels of thyroid hormones.
Serum thyrotropin concentrations are high in patients with thyroid deficiency (hypothyroidism) because there is decreased negative feedback inhibition of thyrotropin release by the low serum thyroid hormone concentrations. Conversely, serum thyrotropin concentrations are low in patients with hyperthyroidism (except in the case of a thyrotropin-secreting pituitary tumour) because there is increased negative feedback inhibition of thyrotropin secretion by the high serum thyroid hormone concentrations. The changes in serum thyroid hormone concentrations need not be large to produce notable symptoms, and measurement of serum thyrotropin is useful for detecting both hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism when those disorders are caused by thyroid disease. Hypothalamic or pituitary disease may cause low serum thyrotropin and low serum thyroid hormone concentrations, also known as central hypothyroidism.
