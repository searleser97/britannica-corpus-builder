Phorate,   generically, a powerful pesticide effective against insects, mites, and nematodes. It is a systemic insecticide that acts by inhibiting cholinesterases, enzymes involved in transmitting nerve impulses. Chemically, it is an organophosphate, O,O-diethyl S-(ethylthio)methyl phosphorodithioate. Like all organophosphates, it is related to the nerve gases and is among the most toxic of all pesticides to vertebrates, including humans.
As a systemic, phorate is taken up by the roots of plants and translocated to the parts above ground, where it is concentrated in new leaves and fruits and kills sucking pests that consume sufficient plant sap containing the chemical.
Because of its persistence in soil it is most useful in controlling soil-dwelling nematodes (microscopic roundworms that suck plant roots and transmit disease thereby). It is not recommended for use by the homeowner because it is extremely toxic and persistent.
