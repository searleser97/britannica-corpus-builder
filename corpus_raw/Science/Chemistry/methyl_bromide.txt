Methyl bromide, also called bromomethane,  a colourless, nonflammable, highly toxic gas (readily liquefied) belonging to the family of organic halogen compounds. It is used as a fumigant against insects and rodents in food, tobacco, and nursery stock; smaller amounts are used in the preparation of other organic compounds.
Methyl bromide is manufactured by the reaction of methanol with hydrobromic acid; it is slightly soluble in water but miscible with many organic solvents. For use as a fumigant, methyl bromide often is mixed with chloropicrin, which serves as a warning agent because of its intense odour.
