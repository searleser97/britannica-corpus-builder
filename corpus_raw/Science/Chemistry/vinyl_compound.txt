Vinyl compound,   any of various organic chemical compounds, including acrylic compounds and styrene and its derivatives, that are useful in making plastic film; sheeting; upholstery; floor tile; inflatable and solid toys; buttons; molded and extruded articles; fibres for weaving into fabric; insulation for wire; screening; tubing, especially for chemicals; substitutes for rubber; and components of water-base paints and textile finishes.
Vinyl compounds contain the hydrocarbon vinyl group (CH2=CH-). The molecules of a single vinyl compound can be made to polymerize; that is, to join end to end, forming a polyvinyl compound such as polyvinyl chloride. The molecules of two different compounds can also be made to link up, forming a copolymer, such as the plastic Vinylite and the textile fibre vinyon. See also polyvinyl acetate; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl chloride; vinyl chloride; vinylidene chloride.
