Activation energy,  in chemistry, the minimum amount of energy that is required to activate atoms or molecules to a condition in which they can undergo chemical transformation or physical transport. In transition-state theory, the activation energy is the difference in energy content between atoms or molecules in an activated or transition-state configuration and the corresponding atoms and molecules in their initial configuration. The activation energy is usually represented by the symbol Ea in mathematical expressions for such quantities as the reaction rate constant, k = Aexp(−Ea/RT), and the diffusion coefficient, D = Doexp(−Ea/RT).
Activation energies are determined from experimental rate constants or diffusion coefficients that are measured at different temperatures.
