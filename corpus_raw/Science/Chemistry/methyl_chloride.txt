Methyl chloride (CH3Cl), also called chloromethane,  a colourless, flammable, toxic gas. Methyl chloride is primarily prepared by reaction of methanol with hydrogen chloride, although it also can be prepared by chlorination of methane. Annual production in the United States alone is in the hundreds of millions of kg, half of which is converted to dichlorodimethylsilane for the preparation of silicone polymers. Methyl chloride is also employed as a methylating agent to attach CH3 groups to oxygen (as in methylcellulose) and nitrogen (as in quaternary ammonium salts) and as a solvent for the low-temperature preparation of butyl rubber. It is used to prepare dichloromethane (methylene chloride) as well.
Methyl chloride boils at −24 °C (−11.2 °F) and is shipped as a liquefied gas under its own pressure.
