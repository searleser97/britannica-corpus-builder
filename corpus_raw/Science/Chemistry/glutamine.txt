Glutamine,  an amino acid, the monoamide of glutamic acid, and an abundant constituent of proteins. First isolated from gliadin, a protein present in wheat (1932), glutamine is widely distributed in plants; e.g., beets, carrots, and radishes. Important in cellular metabolism in animals, glutamine is the only amino acid capable of readily crossing the barrier between blood and brain and, with glutamic acid, is thought to account for about 80 percent of the amino nitrogen (â€•NH2) of brain tissue. It is one of several so-called nonessential amino acids; i.e., animals can synthesize it from glutamic acid and do not require dietary sources. The chemical structure of glutamine is
