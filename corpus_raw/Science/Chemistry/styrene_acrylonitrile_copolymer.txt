Styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN),  a rigid, transparent plastic produced by the copolymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile. SAN combines the clarity and rigidity of polystyrene with the hardness, strength, and heat and solvent resistance of polyacrylonitrile. It was introduced in the 1950s and is employed in automotive parts, battery cases, kitchenware, appliances, furniture, and medical supplies.
SAN consists of styrene units and acrylonitrile units in a ratio of approximately 70 to 30. The two compounds are mixed in bulk-liquid form or in a water-based emulsion or suspension, and polymerization is conducted under the action of free-radical initiators. The resultant plastic material displays better resistance to heat and solvents than does polystyrene alone. The impact resistance of the copolymer is not satisfactory for many engineering applications, however, and styrene and acrylonitrile are therefore often copolymerized with admixtures of butadiene rubber to produce a more shatter-proof product known as ABS, or acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer.
