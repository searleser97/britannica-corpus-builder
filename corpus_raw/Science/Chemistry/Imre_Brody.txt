Imre Bródy,  (born Dec. 23, 1891, Gyula, Hung.—died Dec. 20/22, 1944, Mühldorf, Ger.), Hungarian physicist who was one of the inventors of the krypton-filled lightbulb.
A nephew of the well-known writer Sándor Bródy, Imre Bródy was a student of Loránd, Báró (baron) Eötvös, at Budapest University (now Eötvös Loránd University). Bródy completed his doctoral thesis on the chemical constant of monatomic gases in 1917 and was appointed an assistant lecturer at Budapest University in 1919. From 1920 to 1923 he was at the University of Göttingen, Ger., working with Max Born as a physicist and serving as one of the editors of Zeitschrift für Physik (“Journal of Physics”). In 1923 he returned to Budapest and joined the Egyesült Izzó (United Light Bulb) research laboratory.
There he worked with Emil Theisz, Ferenc Kőrösy, Tivadar Millner, and the chemist and later philosopher of science Mihály Polányi (Michael Polányi) on the production of krypton and the development of the krypton lamp. The patent for the krypton-filled lightbulb was granted in 1930, and the bulb was introduced at the 1936 Budapest Industrial Fair. It soon became one of Hungary’s most valued exports. After the Nazi occupation of Hungary (March 1944), Bródy, a Jew, was deported to a German concentration camp, where he died.
