Protactinium (Pa),  radioactive chemical element of the actinoid series of the periodic table, rarer than radium; its atomic number is 91. It occurs in all uranium ores to the extent of 0.34 part per million of uranium. Its existence was predicted by Russian chemist Dmitry Mendeleyev in his 1871 periodic table. Protactinium metal was first prepared (1934) by American chemist Aristid V. Grosse. The first isotope, protactinium-234, was discovered (1913) by American chemists Kasimir Fajans and O.H. Göhring. They named it brevium, afterward uranium X2, because it was a short-lived member of the uranium radioactive decay series. The long-lived isotope protactinium-231 (originally called protoactinium for “before actinium” and later shortened to protactinium) was discovered (1917) independently by German chemist Otto Hahn and Austrian physicist Lise Meitner in pitchblende, by Fajans, and by British chemists Frederick Soddy, John Cranston, and Sir Alexander Fleck. This isotope decays to actinium-227 with a half-life of 32,760 years.
All 29 isotopes are radioactive; synthetic protactinium-233 is produced by neutron irradiation of thorium-232 after it is converted to thorium-233 and is the progenitor of the fissile uranium isotope uranium-233 in the production of nuclear fuel from thorium. Protactinium in most of its compounds exhibits an oxidation state of +5 (thus resembling tantalum) but also can be obtained in the +4 state. Its compounds readily hydrolyze in water, forming colloids, but dissolve by forming complex ions (as with the fluoride ion in hydrofluoric acid).
