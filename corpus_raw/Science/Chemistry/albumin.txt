Albumin,   a type of protein that is soluble in water and in water half saturated with a salt such as ammonium sulfate. Serum albumin is a component of blood serum; α-lactalbumin is found in milk. Ovalbumin constitutes about 50 percent of the proteins of egg white; conalbumin is also a component. Seeds contain very small amounts of albumins (0.1–0.5 percent by weight). See also proteinuria.
The term albumen was once applied to water-soluble protein systems, such as egg white, containing proteins other than albumins.
