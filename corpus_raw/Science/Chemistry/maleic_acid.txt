Maleic acid, also called cis-butenedioic acid (HO2CCH=CHCO2H),  unsaturated organic dibasic acid, used in making polyesters for fibre-reinforced laminated moldings and paint vehicles, and in the manufacture of fumaric acid and many other chemical products. Maleic acid and its anhydride are prepared industrially by the catalytic oxidation of benzene.
Maleic acid shows reactions typical of both olefins and carboxylic acids. Commercially important reactions of the acid groups include esterification with glycols to polyesters and dehydration to the anhydride. The double bond is involved in conversions to fumaric acid, to sulfosuccinic acid (used in wetting agents), and to Malathion (an insecticide).
Maleic acid melts at 139–140° C (282–284° F); at higher temperatures it forms the anhydride, which, like the acid, is irritating to the skin and toxic.
Maleic anhydride is interchangeable with the acid in most applications.
Fumaric acid, or trans-butenedioic acid, the geometrical isomer of maleic acid, occurs in fumitory (Fumaria officinalis), in various fungi, and in Iceland moss. Like maleic acid, it is used in polyesters, and since it is nontoxic, unlike maleic acid, it is used as an acidulant in foods. It is produced by isomerization of maleic acid or by fermentation of molasses. Its reactions are generally similar to those of maleic acid, although it cannot form an intramolecular anhydride. It is very much less soluble in water and most other solvents than its isomer.
