Aspartame,  synthetic organic compound (a dipeptide) of phenylalanine and aspartic acid. It is 150â€“200 times as sweet as cane sugar and is used as a nonnutritive tabletop sweetener and in low-calorie prepared foods (brand names NutraSweet, Equal) but is not suitable for baking. Because of its phenylalanine content, persons with phenylketonuria must avoid it. Though it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities around the world, its safety even for those without the disease remains controversial. See also saccharin.
