Fluorocarbon polymer, also called fluoropolymer or fluorinated polymer,  any of a number of organic polymers whose large, multiple-unit molecules consist of a chain of carbon atoms to which fluorine atoms are appended. Owing to the presence of the highly polar fluorine atoms, which form extremely strong bonds with the carbon chain and resist further chemical reactions, fluorocarbon polymers are noted for their high melting temperatures, chemical inertness, and resistance to degradation by sunlight. The most widely used fluorocarbon polymer is polytetrafluoroethylene, a high-melting nonstick plastic commonly known by the trademark Teflon. A plastic with similar properties, but easier to melt and shape owing to the presence of chlorine atoms in the polymer, is polychlorotrifluoroethylene. Polyvinyl fluoride and polyvinylidene fluoride are two other tough plastics often employed as protective coatings.
The term fluoroelastomer denotes a series of elastic fluorocarbon polymers that are made into seals and gaskets for very demanding applications in the aerospace and chemical-processing industries.
