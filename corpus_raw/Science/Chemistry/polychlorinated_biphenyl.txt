Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB),  any of a class of organohalogen compounds prepared by the reaction of chlorine with biphenyl. A typical mixture of PCBs may contain over 100 compounds and is a colourless, viscous liquid. The mixture is relatively insoluble in water, is stable at high temperatures, and is a good dielectric (electrical insulator). Because of these qualities, PCBs are particularly useful as lubricants, heat-transfer fluids, and fire-resistant insulating fluids in transformers and capacitors.
PCBs came into widespread use during the 1930s and â€™40s, but mounting concerns about their safety eventually brought a ban on their production (1979 in the United States). PCBs were never intended to be released into the environment, but they found their way into the air, water, and soil via industrial and municipal waste disposal and via leaks from mechanical and electrical equipment.
The resistance of PCBs to decomposition ensures that they remain in soils and bodies of water for many years, where they become increasingly concentrated in the fatty tissue of organisms higher up in the food chain. PCBs are particularly toxic to fishes and invertebrates and are fatal to these animals even in small concentrations. PCBs cause liver dysfunction, dermatitis, and dizziness in humans exposed to them. The chemicals are also suspected of being carcinogenic (cancer-causing).
PCB levels in the environment have dropped since the manufacture and use of the compounds were curtailed, but so much electrical equipment containing PCBs is still in use that there is a continuing possibility of environmental damage. The most effective means for destroying PCBs in discarded equipment is by incineration. Progress is being made in using microbial degradation to reduce the concentration of PCBs in soil.
