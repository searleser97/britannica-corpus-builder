Citral (C10H16O), also called 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal,  a pale yellow liquid, with a strong lemon odour, that occurs in the essential oils of plants. It is insoluble in water but soluble in ethanol (ethyl alcohol), diethyl ether, and mineral oil. It is used in perfumes and flavourings and in the manufacture of other chemicals. Chemically, citral is a mixture of two aldehydes that have the same molecular formula but different structures.

Lemongrass oil contains 70â€“80 percent citral, which may be isolated by distillation. Other natural sources include the oils of verbena and citronella. Citral can be synthesized from myrcene. Ionone and methylionone, made from citral, are used in perfumery; ionone is also converted into synthetic vitamin A.
