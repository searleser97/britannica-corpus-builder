Vitamin K,  any of several fat-soluble naphthoquinone compounds. Vitamin K (from the Danish word koagulation) is required for the synthesis of several blood clotting factors, including prothrombin and factors VII, IX, and X. A form of vitamin K known as phylloquinone (vitamin K1) is synthesized by plants. A second form of vitamin K known as menaquinone (vitamin K2) is synthesized by bacteria, including bacteria in the intestines of mammals. These bacteria produce the majority of vitamin K that mammals require. A synthetic vitamin K precursor called menadione (vitamin K3) is used as a vitamin supplement. First recognized in 1929, the vitamin was isolated and analyzed structurally in 1939 by Danish biochemist Henrik Dam.
A deficiency of vitamin K in the body leads to an increase in clotting time of the blood. Vitamin K deficiency is seldom naturally encountered in higher animals because the vitamin is usually adequately supplied in the diet, besides being synthesized by intestinal bacteria. In humans, deficiency may occur following the administration of certain drugs that inhibit the growth of the vitamin-synthesizing bacteria or as a result of disorders affecting the production or flow of bile, which itself is necessary for the intestinal absorption of vitamin K. In newborn infants, the absence of intestinal bacteria, low levels of vitamin K in the motherâ€™s milk, or the absence of body stores of vitamin K may result in bleeding, which can be prevented by the administration of vitamin K to the infant shortly after birth.
