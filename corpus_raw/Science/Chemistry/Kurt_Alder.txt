Kurt Alder,  (born July 10, 1902, Königshütte, Prussia [now Chorzów, Pol.]—died June 20, 1958, Cologne, W.Ger.), German chemist who was the corecipient, with the German organic chemist Otto Diels, of the 1950 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their development of the Diels-Alder reaction, or diene synthesis, a widely used method of synthesizing cyclic organic compounds.
Alder studied chemistry at the University of Berlin and then at the University of Kiel in Germany, where he received his doctorate in 1926. In 1928 Alder and Diels discovered, and published a paper on, the reaction of dienes with quinones. The Diels-Alder reaction consists essentially of the linking of a diene, which is a substance containing two alternate double molecular bonds, to a dienophile, which is a compound containing a pair of doubly or triply bonded carbon atoms. The diene and dienophile readily react to form a six-membered ring compound. Similar reactions had been recorded by others, but Alder and Diels provided the first experimental proof of the nature of the reaction and demonstrated its application to the synthesis of a wide range of ring compounds. Diene synthesis can be effected without the use of powerful chemical reagents. It has been used to synthesize such complex molecules as morphine, reserpine, cortisone, and other steroids, the insecticides dieldrin and aldrin, and other alkaloids and polymers.
Alder was a professor of chemistry at the University of Kiel from 1934 to 1936. He applied his fundamental research to the development of plastics while working as a research director for IG Farben (1936), then the world’s largest chemical concern. In 1940 he became professor of chemistry and director of the chemical institute at the University of Cologne. In 1943 he discovered the ene reaction, which is similar to the diene synthesis, and which also found widespread use in chemical synthesis.
