Strain theory,   in chemistry, a proposal made in 1885 by the German chemist Adolf von Baeyer that the stability of carbocyclic compounds (i.e., those of which the molecular structure includes one or more rings of carbon atoms) depends on the amount by which the angles between the chemical bonds deviate from the value (109°28′) observed in compounds not containing such rings. The amount of deviation is the measure of the strain of the ring: the greater the strain, the less stable is the ring. Baeyer postulated that these rings are planar and concluded that strain exists in three- and four-membered rings and in rings of six or more atoms, the strain increasing with the size of the ring. The least strained ring is that of five-carbon cyclopentane, in which the bond angles are 108°.
Baeyer’s ideas, although still considered essentially correct, have been significantly extended. Another German chemist, H. Sachse, in 1890 suggested that in rings of six or more atoms the strain can be relieved completely if the ring is not planar but puckered, as in the so-called chair and boat conformations of cyclohexane. These large rings should then be as stable as those of five atoms—a conclusion that has been verified experimentally. For example, no significant difference referable to strain has been found between the stability of cyclotriacontane, with 30 atoms in the ring, and that of cyclopentane, with only 5.
