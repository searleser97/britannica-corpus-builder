Heat of formation, also called standard heat of formation, enthalpy of formation, or standard enthalpy of formation,  the amount of heat absorbed or evolved when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements, each substance being in its normal physical state (gas, liquid, or solid). Usually the conditions at which the compound is formed are taken to be at a temperature of 25 °C (77 °F) and a pressure of 1 atmosphere, in which case the heat of formation can be called the standard heat of formation. The heat of formation of an element is arbitrarily assigned a value of zero. By using Hess’s law of heat summation, one can calculate the heat absorbed or evolved in any chemical reaction by summing the known heats of formation or combustion for the steps in that reaction.
