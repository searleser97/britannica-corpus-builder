Shirakawa Hideki,  (born August 20, 1936, Tokyo, Japan), Japanese chemist who, with Alan G. MacDiarmid and Alan J. Heeger, won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2000 for their discovery that certain plastics can be chemically altered to conduct electricity almost as readily as metals.
Shirakawa earned a Ph.D. from the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1966. That same year he joined the faculty of the Institute of Materials Science at the University of Tsukuba, where he became professor of chemistry in 1982; he retired as professor emeritus in 2000.
In 1974 Shirakawa and associates serendipitously synthesized polyacetylene, a polymer that was known to exist as a black powder, into a silvery film that possessed many properties of metal. In 1977 he began collaborating with MacDiarmid and Heeger at the University of Pennsylvania, where they exposed polyacetylene to iodine vapour. Their plan was to introduce impurities into the polymer much as in the doping process used to tailor the conductive properties of semiconductors. Doping with iodine increased polyacetyleneâ€™s electrical conductivity by a factor of 10 million, making it as conductive as some metals. Other conductive polymers were later discovered and were expected to play a significant role in the emerging field of molecular electronics.
