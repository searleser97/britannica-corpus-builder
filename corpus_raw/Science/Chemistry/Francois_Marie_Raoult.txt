François-Marie Raoult,  (born May 10, 1830, Fournes-en-Weppes, France—died  April 1, 1901, Grenoble), French chemist who formulated a law on solutions (called Raoult’s law) that made it possible to determine the molecular weights of dissolved substances.
Raoult taught at the University of Grenoble from 1867 and was professor there from 1870 until his death. About 1886 he discovered that the freezing point of an aqueous solution is lowered in proportion to the amount of a nonelectrolytic substance dissolved.
This observation led to the expression of Raoult’s law, which states that the changes in certain related properties of a liquid (e.g., vapour pressure, boiling point, or freezing point) that occur when a substance is dissolved in the liquid are proportional to the number of molecules of dissolved substance (solute) present for a given quantity of solvent molecules. The relationship has been of fundamental importance in the development of the theory of solutions, although few real solutions behave strictly in accordance with it. A solution that conforms to Raoult’s law is called an ideal solution.
