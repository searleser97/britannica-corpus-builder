Deuteron,   nucleus of deuterium (heavy hydrogen) that consists of one proton and one neutron. Deuterons are formed chiefly by ionizing deuterium (stripping the single electron away from the atom) and are used as projectiles to produce nuclear reactions after accumulating high energies in particle accelerators. A deuteron also results from the capture of a slow neutron by a proton, accompanied by the emission of a gamma photon.
