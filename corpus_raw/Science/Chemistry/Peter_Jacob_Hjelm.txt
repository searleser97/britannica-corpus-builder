Peter Jacob Hjelm,  (born October 2, 1746, Sunnerbo district, Småland, Sweden—died October 7, 1813, Stockholm), Swedish chemist who isolated the element molybdenum in 1781.
Hjelm was educated at Uppsala University and was a friend of the great Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele. In 1781 Scheele sent him an oxide of molybdenum, which he had succeeded in obtaining by acid treatment of the mineral molybdenite. Hjelm reduced the oxide with carbon and obtained the first sample of metallic molybdenum. In 1782 Hjelm became master of assaying for the Royal Mint, Stockholm, and in 1794 he was appointed director of chemical laboratories at the Swedish bureau of mines. His research interests included mineralogy, metallurgy, and industrial chemistry. He is also credited with the observation that pig iron made from ore containing manganese, which he isolated successfully in 1781, frequently produced superior steel.
