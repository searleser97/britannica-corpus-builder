Zymogen, also called Proenzyme,  any of a group of proteins that display no catalytic activity but are transformed within an organism into enzymes, especially those that catalyze reactions involving the breakdown of proteins. Trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, zymogens secreted by the pancreas, are activated in the intestinal tract to trypsin and chymotrypsin. Activation is effected by the cleavage of one or more peptide bonds of the zymogen molecule and may be catalyzed by a separate enzyme—e.g., enterokinase converts trypsinogen to trypsin—or by the active form itself—trypsin also converts trypsinogen to more trypsin. Zymogenic cells synthesize and store zymogens in inactive form.
