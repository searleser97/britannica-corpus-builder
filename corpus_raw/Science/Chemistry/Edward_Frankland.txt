Sir Edward Frankland,   (born Jan. 18, 1825, Churchtown, Lancashire, Eng.—died  Aug. 9, 1899, Golaa, Nor.), English chemist who was one of the first investigators in the field of structural chemistry.
While apprenticed to a druggist, Frankland learned to perform chemical experiments. Subsequent studies took him to laboratories at the University of Marburg, where he took his Ph.D. (1849). He became the first professor of chemistry at Owens College, Manchester (1851), and succeeded Michael Faraday as professor of chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, London (1863). In 1865 he began 20 years of service at the Royal School of Mines.
Research beginning about 1850 led him to the idea that an atom of an element can combine only with a certain limited number of atoms of other elements. He thus established a theory of valency (1852), which became the basis of modern structural chemistry.
Appointed a member of the second royal commission on the pollution of rivers (1868), he brought to light an enormous amount of information on the contamination of rivers and on water purification. In 1868 he cooperated with Joseph Norman Lockyer in the studies that led Lockyer to recognize the existence of helium in the Sun’s atmosphere. Frankland was knighted in 1897.
