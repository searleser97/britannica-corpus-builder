K. Barry Sharpless,  (born April 28, 1941, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American scientist who, with William S. Knowles and Noyori Ryōji, won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 for developing the first chiral catalysts.
Sharpless received a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1968. After postdoctoral work, he joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1970. In 1990 he became W.M. Keck Professor of Chemistry at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California.
Many molecules are chiral—they exist in two structural forms (enantiomers) that are nonsuperimposable mirror images. Likewise, the receptors, enzymes, and other cellular components made from these molecules are chiral and tend to interact selectively with only one or two enantiomers of a given substance. For many drugs, however, conventional laboratory synthesis results in a mixture of enantiomers. One form usually has the desired effect while the other form may be inactive or cause undesirable side effects, such as occurred with the drug thalidomide. This problem led scientists to pursue chiral catalysts, which drive chemical reactions toward just one of two possible outcomes.
Sharpless’s research focused on chiral catalysts for oxidations, a broad family of chemical reactions. Atoms, ions, or molecules that undergo oxidation in reactions lose electrons and, in so doing, increase their functionality, or capacity to form chemical bonds. In 1980, working at MIT, Sharpless carried out key experiments that led to a practical method based on catalytic asymmetrical oxidation for producing epoxide compounds, used in the synthesis of heart medicines such as beta blockers and other products.
