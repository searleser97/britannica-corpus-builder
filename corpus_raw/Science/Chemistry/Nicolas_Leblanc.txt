Nicolas Leblanc,  (born 1742?, Issoudun, France—died  Jan. 16, 1806, Saint-Denis), French surgeon and chemist who in 1790 developed the process for making soda ash (sodium carbonate) from common salt (sodium chloride). This process, which bears his name, became one of the most important industrial-chemical processes of the 19th century.
Leblanc was the son of the director of an ironworks. He received a medical education, and about 1780 he became a private surgeon to the Duke d’Orléans. Five years earlier the Academy of Sciences had offered a prize for a process to convert salt to soda ash. Extracted at that time by crude methods from wood or seaweed ashes, soda ash was used in making paper, glass, soap, and porcelain; if these industries were to expand, a cheaper process was needed. Because salt and soda ash are simple compounds of sodium, scientists correctly reasoned that transformation was possible.
In the Leblanc process, salt was treated with sulfuric acid to obtain salt cake (sodium sulfate). This was then roasted with limestone or chalk and coal to produce black ash, which consisted primarily of sodium carbonate and calcium sulfide. The sodium carbonate was dissolved in water and then crystallized.
The Leblanc process was simple, cheap, and direct, but because the French Revolution had begun by the time Leblanc completed his experiments in 1790, he never received his prize. The National Assembly awarded him a 15-year patent in September 1791 but confiscated his patent and factory three years later with only token compensation. Though Napoleon returned the factory about 1800, Leblanc was never able to raise enough capital to reopen it and died a suicide in 1806.
