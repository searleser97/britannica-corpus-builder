Deliquescence,   the process by which a substance absorbs moisture from the atmosphere until it dissolves in the absorbed water and forms a solution. Deliquescence occurs when the vapour pressure of the solution that is formed is less than the partial pressure of water vapour in the air. All soluble salts will deliquesce if the air is sufficiently humid. A substance that absorbs moisture from the air but not necessarily to the point of dissolution is called hygroscopic. 
The effectiveness of calcined calcium chloride in settling road dust is a result of its deliquescence. When spread in the form of a powder or flakes, it absorbs more than its own weight of water and forms a liquid that keeps the road wet. See also efflorescence.
