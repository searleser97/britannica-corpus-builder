Cryolite,   colourless to white halide mineral, sodium aluminum fluoride (Na3AlF6). It occurs in a large deposit at Ivigtut, Greenland, and in small amounts in Spain, Colorado, U.S., and elsewhere. It is used as a solvent for bauxite in the electrolytic production of aluminum and has various other metallurgical applications, and it is used in the glass and enamel industries, in bonded abrasives as a filler, and in the manufacture of insecticides. A large amount of synthetic cryolite is made from fluorite. For detailed physical properties, see halide mineral (table).
