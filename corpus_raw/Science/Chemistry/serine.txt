serine,  an amino acid obtainable by hydrolysis of most common proteins, sometimes constituting 5 to 10 percent by weight of the total product. First isolated in 1865 from sericin, a silk protein, serine is one of several so-called nonessential amino acids for mammals; i.e., they can synthesize it from glucose and do not require dietary sources. The chemical structure of serine is
Serine and some of its derivatives (e.g., ethanolamine) are also important components of a class of lipids (phospholipids) found in biological membranes.
