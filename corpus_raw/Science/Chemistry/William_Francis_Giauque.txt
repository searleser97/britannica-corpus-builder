William Francis Giauque,  (born May 12, 1895, Niagara Falls, Ont., Can.—died  March 28, 1982, Berkeley, Calif., U.S.), Canadian-born American physical chemist and winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1949 for his studies of the properties of matter at temperatures close to absolute zero.
After earning his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1922, Giauque joined the chemistry faculty there and held posts at the school until 1981. In 1927 he proposed a new method of achieving extremely low temperatures using a process called adiabatic demagnetization. By 1933 he had a working apparatus that obtained a temperature within one-tenth of a degree of absolute zero (−273.15° C). His research confirmed the third law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of ordered solids reaches zero at the absolute zero of temperature. In the course of his low-temperature studies of oxygen, Giauque discovered with Herrick L. Johnston the oxygen isotopes of mass 17 and 18.
