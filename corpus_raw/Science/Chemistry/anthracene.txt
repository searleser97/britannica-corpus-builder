Anthracene,   a tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon found in coal tar and used as a starting material for the manufacture of dyestuffs and in scintillation counters. Crude anthracene crystallizes from a high-boiling coal-tar fraction. It is purified by recrystallization and sublimation. Oxidation yields anthraquinone (q.v.), an intermediate in the production of dyes and pigments. Pure anthracene crystallizes in colourless monoclinic plates, which show a blue fluorescence.
