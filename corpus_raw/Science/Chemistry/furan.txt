Furan,   any of a class of organic compounds of the heterocyclic aromatic series characterized by a ring structure composed of one oxygen atom and four carbon atoms. The simplest member of the furan family is furan itself, a colourless, volatile, and somewhat toxic liquid that boils at 31.36° C (88.45° F). It is usually converted by hydrogenation to tetrahydrofuran, which is used as a solvent and for production of adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine, the raw materials for nylon-6,6. Several other members of the furan family are produced on a large scale for use as solvents and chemical raw materials. The first furan compound discovered was pyromucic acid (2-furoic acid), prepared in 1780. The aldehyde furfural, used as a solvent in petroleum refining, is manufactured from corn cobs and oat hulls by treatment with acid.
Many sugars exist in molecular forms called furanoses, possessing the tetrahydrofuran ring system. Important examples are provided by ribose and deoxyribose—which are present in the furanose form in nucleic acids, the heredity-controlling components of all living cells—and fructose.
