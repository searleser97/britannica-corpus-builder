Fukui Kenichi,  (born Oct. 4, 1918,  Nara, Japan—died Jan. 9, 1998, Kyoto), Japanese chemist, corecipient with Roald Hoffmann of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1981 for their independent investigations of the mechanisms of chemical reactions.
Fukui took little interest in chemistry before enrolling at Kyoto University, where he studied engineering, receiving a Ph.D. in 1948. He was professor of physical chemistry at Kyoto from 1951 to 1982 and was president of the Kyoto Institute of Technology from 1982 to 1988.
In 1952 Fukui published his first exposition of the concept that the crucial process in many chemical reactions consists of an interaction between the highest occupied molecular orbital of one compound and the lowest unoccupied orbital of the other. In effect, one molecule shares its most loosely bound electrons with the other, which accepts them at the site where they can become most tightly bound. The interaction results in the formation of a new, occupied orbital that has properties intermediate between those of the two former ones. Fukui designated these labile orbitals “frontier orbitals” and provided examples of their significance in reactions that produce important classes of organic compounds.
