Thiophene,   the simplest sulfur-containing aromatic compound, with molecular formula C4H4S, which closely resembles benzene in its chemical and physical properties. It occurs with benzene in coal tar, from which source it was first isolated in 1883. Today, thiophene is prepared commercially from butane or butene and sulfur or sulfur dioxide. Certain thiophene derivatives occur as plant pigments and other natural products. Biotin is a reduced thiophene derivative. The antihistamine methapyrilene (Thenylene) and certain other synthetic pharmaceuticals contain the thiophene nucleus, but there are few synthetic thiophene compounds of importance.
