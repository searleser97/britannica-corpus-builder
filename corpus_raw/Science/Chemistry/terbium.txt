terbium (Tb),  chemical element, a rare-earth metal of the lanthanide series of the periodic table.
Terbium is a moderately hard, silvery white metal that is stable in air when in pure form. The metal is relatively stable in air even at high temperatures, because of formation of a tight, dark oxide layer that can be represented as a mixed oxide composed of Tb2O3 and TbO2. Terbium readily reacts with diluted acids, but it is insoluble in hydrofluoric acid (HF) because the presence of the fluoride ion protects the metal from further reaction by forming a protective layer of TbF3. The metal is a very strong paramagnet above 230 K (−43 °C, or −46 °F); it is antiferromagnetic between 220 K (−53 °C, or −64 °F) and 230 K, and it becomes ferromagnetic below 220 K.
The element was discovered in 1843 by Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander in a heavy rare-earth fraction called yttria, but its existence was not confirmed for at least 30 years, and pure compounds were not prepared until 1905. Terbium occurs in many rare-earth minerals but is almost exclusively obtained from bastnasite and from laterite ion-exchange clays. It is also found in the products of nuclear fission. Terbium is one of the least abundant of the rare earths; its abundance in Earth’s crust is about the same as thallium.
The only isotope occurring in ores is terbium-159. A total of 36 (excluding nuclear isomers) radioactive isotopes of terbium have been identified. Their mass ranges from 135 to 171 with half-life ranging from more than 200 nanoseconds (terbium-138) to 180 years (terbium-158).
Solvent-solvent extraction and ion-exchange techniques are utilized for commercial production of terbium. The metal is prepared in a highly pure form by metallothermic reduction of the anhydrous fluoride with calcium metal. Terbium exists in three allotropic (structural) forms. The α-phase is close-packed hexagonal with a = 3.6055 Å and c = 5.6966 Å at room temperature. The ferromagnetic ordering below 220 K is accompanied by an orthorhombic distortion of the hexagonal lattice to the β-phase with a = 3.605 Å, b = 6.244 Å, and c = 5.706 Å at 77 K (−196 °C, or −321 °F). The γ-phase is body-centred cubic with a = 4.07 Å at 1,289 °C (2,352 °F).
Terbium compounds are used as green phosphors in fluorescent lamps, computer monitors, and TV screens that use cathode-ray tubes. Another major use is with dysprosium and iron in the magnetostrictive alloy Terfenol-D (Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe2), which is a component of magnetically controlled actuators, sonar systems, and pressure sensors. Together with another lanthanide—gadolinium—terbium was used by Geoffrey Green and coworkers in 1990 to build a dual-stage room-temperature magnetic refrigerator prototype, with gadolinium as a high-temperature stage and terbium as a low-temperature stage.
Terbium is one of a few rare earths that have a +4 as well as a +3 oxidation state; the former is a result of stability of the half-filled 4f shell. The brown oxide prepared by air ignition has the approximate formula Tb4O7; the oxide TbO2 is obtained by using atomic oxygen. The tetrafluoride TbF4 is prepared by fluorinating the trifluoride; the Tb4+ ion is not known in solution. In other salts and in solution, terbium is present in the +3 oxidation state and behaves as a typical rare earth. Its solutions are pale pink to colourless.
