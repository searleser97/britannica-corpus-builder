Aliphatic compound,  any chemical compound belonging to the organic class in which the atoms are connected by single, double, or triple bonds to form nonaromatic structures. One of the major structural groups of organic molecules, the aliphatic compounds include the alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes and substances derived from them—actually or in principle—by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms by atoms of other elements or groups of atoms.
