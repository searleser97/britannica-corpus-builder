Lyase,   in physiology, any member of a class of enzymes that catalyze the addition or removal of the elements of water (hydrogen, oxygen), ammonia (nitrogen, hydrogen), or carbon dioxide (carbon, oxygen) at double bonds. For example, decarboxylases remove carbon dioxide from amino acids and dehydrases remove water. See enzyme.
