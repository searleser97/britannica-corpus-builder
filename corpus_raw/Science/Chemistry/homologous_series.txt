Homologous series,   any of numerous groups of chemical compounds in each of which the difference between successive members is a simple structural unit. Such series are most common among organic compounds, the structural difference being a methylene group, as in the paraffin hydrocarbons, or alkanes; the normal primary alcohols, or 1-alkanols; and the normal carboxylic acids, or alkanoic acids. In each of these homologous series the number of methylene groups—designated by the subscript n—may have the successive values 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
Homologous series of inorganic compounds include the phosphoric acids, the silicic acids, and the phosphonitrilic chlorides.
Within a given homologous series the chemical properties of the compounds are essentially all alike, and the physical properties vary in a continuous and predictable manner.
