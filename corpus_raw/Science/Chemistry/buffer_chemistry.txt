Buffer,  in chemistry, solution usually containing an acid and a base, or a salt, that tends to maintain a constant hydrogen ion concentration. Ions are atoms or molecules that have lost or gained one or more electrons. An example of a common buffer is a solution of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and sodium acetate. In water solution, sodium acetate is completely dissociated into sodium (Na+) and acetate (CH3COO-) ions. The hydrogen ion concentration of the buffer solution is given by the expression:

in which Ka is the ionization constant of acetic acid and the expressions in brackets are the concentrations of the respective substances. The hydrogen ion concentration of the buffer solution is dependent on the relative amounts of acetic acid and acetate ion (or sodium acetate) present, known as the buffer ratio. The addition of an acid or a base will cause corresponding changes in the concentration of acetic acid and acetate ion, but as long as the concentration of the added substances is small compared to the concentration of the individual buffer components, the new hydrogen ion concentration will remain close to its original value.
Buffer solutions with different hydrogen ion concentrations may be prepared by varying the buffer ratio and by choice of an acid of appropriate intrinsic strength. Buffer solutions commonly used include phosphoric, citric, or boric acids and their salts.
Because acids and bases tend to promote a wide range of chemical reactions, the maintenance of a certain level of acidity or alkalinity in a solution through the use of buffer solutions is essential to many chemical and biological experiments. Many biochemical processes occur only at specific pH values, which are maintained by natural buffers present in the body.
