Boron carbide,   (B4C), crystalline compound of boron and carbon. It is an extremely hard, synthetically produced material that is used in abrasive and wear-resistant products, in lightweight composite materials, and in control rods for nuclear power generation.
With a Mohs hardness between 9 and 10, boron carbide is one of the hardest synthetic substances known, being exceeded only by cubic boron nitride and diamond. As an abrasive, it is used in powdered form in the lapping (fine abrading) of metal and ceramic products, though its low oxidation temperature of 400–500° C (750–930° F) makes it unable to withstand the heat of grinding hardened tool steels. Because of its hardness, together with its very low density, it has found application as a reinforcing agent for aluminum in military armour and high-performance bicycles, and its wear resistance has caused it to be employed in sandblasting nozzles and pump seals. A neutron absorber, boron carbide is used in powdered or solidified form to control the rate of fission in nuclear reactors.
Boron carbide is produced by reducing boron oxide with carbon at high temperatures in an electric furnace. After grinding, the black powder is solidified by pressing at temperatures exceeding 2,000° C (3,630° F). Its melting point is approximately 2,350° C (4,260° F).
