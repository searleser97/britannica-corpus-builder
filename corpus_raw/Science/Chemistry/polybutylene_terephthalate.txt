Polybutylene terephthalate (PBT),  a strong and highly crystalline synthetic resin, produced by the polymerization of butanediol and terephthalic acid. PBT is similar in structure to polyethylene terephthalate (PET)—the difference being in the number of methylene (CH2) groups present in the repeating units of the polymer molecules. The mechanical properties of the two materials are also similar. However, PBT has a lower melting point (223 °C [433 °F]) than PET (255 °C [491 °F]), so it can be processed at lower temperatures. This property, combined with its excellent flow when molten and its rapid crystallization upon cooling, makes PBT highly suitable for injection-molding into solid parts. Either unmodified or reinforced with glass fibres or mineral fillers, it is used in numerous applications, especially electrical and small machine parts, owing to its excellent electrical resistance, surface finish, and toughness. Pipe made with PBT (so-called polybutylene pipe, or PB pipe) was formerly popular for residential plumbing as a low-cost and easily handled substitute for copper, but it was found to degrade after prolonged contact with oxidizing chemicals such as chlorine in municipal water supplies, so it is no longer used. PBT lends rigidity and thermoplastic properties to a synthetic rubber known as copolyester elastomer.
