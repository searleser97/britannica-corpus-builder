Solvolysis,   a chemical reaction in which the solvent, such as water or alcohol, is one of the reagents and is present in great excess of that required for the reaction. Solvolytic reactions are usually substitution reactions—i.e., reactions in which an atom or a group of atoms in a molecule is replaced by another atom or group of atoms. The solvents act as or produce electron-rich atoms or groups of atoms (nucleophiles) that displace an atom or group in the substrate molecule. At high temperatures or in the presence of strong bases, some solvents act as eliminating agents, producing alkenes from alkyl halides. It is common practice to name solvolysis reactions after the specific solvent, such as “hydrolysis” when water is the reagent.
