Karl August Folkers,  (born September 1, 1906, Decatur, Illinois, U.S.—died December 9, 1997, Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire), American chemist whose research on vitamins resulted in the isolation of vitamin B12, the only effective agent known in countering pernicious anemia.
In 1934 Folkers joined the research laboratories of Merck and Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey. His early work included pioneering studies of curare, erythrina alkaloids, and morphine alkaloids. During the 1930s his research team synthesized and helped establish the chemical structure of numerous B vitamins.
Folkers’s search for the anti-pernicious-anemia factor, begun in 1938, ended in 1948 with the isolation of a red crystalline compound now called vitamin B12. His research team also discovered mevalonic acid, which is a key substance in the production of numerous important biochemical compounds, including carotenoids, steroids, and terpenes.
In 1948 Folkers’s team isolated, synthesized, and determined the structure of numerous members of the streptomycin group of antibiotics. His work also encompassed the antibiotics penicillin, grisein, oxamycin, neomycin, and novobiocin.
Folkers served as president of the Stanford Research Institute, Menlo Park, California, from 1963 to 1968 and then became director of the Institute for Biomedical Research at the University of Texas, Austin.
