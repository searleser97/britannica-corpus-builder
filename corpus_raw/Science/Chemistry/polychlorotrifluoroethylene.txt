polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE),  synthetic resin formed by the polymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene. It is a moldable, temperature-resistant, and chemical-resistant plastic that finds specialty applications in the chemical, electrical, and aerospace industries.
PCTFE can be prepared as a powder by treating an aqueous suspension or emulsion of chlorotrifluoroethylene with polymerization catalysts. The repeating units of the polymeric molecule have the following structure: .
PCTFE powder can be melted and then shaped by molding or by extrusion into solid articles. The plastic remains ductile at temperatures as low as −200 °C (−330 °F) and is stable at temperatures above 200 °C (390 °F). It resists attack by most chemicals, is impermeable to gases, retains its properties upon exposure to gamma radiation, and is an excellent electrical insulator. Because of these properties, it is employed in seals, gaskets, and barriers for cryogenic (ultralow-temperature), petrochemical, aerospace, and uranium-enrichment equipment.
