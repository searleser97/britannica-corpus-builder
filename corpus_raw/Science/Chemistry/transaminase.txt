Transaminase, also called Aminotransferase,  any of a group of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of the amino group (―NH2) of an amino acid to a carbonyl compound, commonly an a-keto acid (an acid with the general formula RCOCOOH). The liver, for example, contains specific transaminases for the transfer of an amino group from glutamic acid to a-keto acids that correspond to most of the other amino acids. Other transaminases catalyze reactions in which an amino group is transferred from glutamic acid to other compounds—e.g., to aldehydes to form amines. Transamination is one of the principal mechanisms for the formation of necessary amino acids in the metabolism of proteins. Vitamin B6 is commonly involved in the action of the transaminases.
