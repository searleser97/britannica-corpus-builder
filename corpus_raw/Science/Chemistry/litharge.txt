Litharge, also called Lithargite,  one of two mineral forms of lead(II) oxide (PbO). It is found with the other form, massicot, as dull or greasy, very heavy, soft, red crusts in the oxidized zone of lead deposits, as at Cucamonga Peak and Fort Tejon, Calif., U.S., and near Hailey, Idaho, U.S. For mineralogic properties, see oxide mineral (table). Synthetic lead(II) oxide is called litharge, though it is a mixture of litharge and massicot.
