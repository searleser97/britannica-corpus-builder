Ubiquinone, also called coenzyme Q or coenzyme Q10,  any of several members of a series of organic compounds belonging to a class called quinones. Widely distributed in plants, animals, and many types of bacteria, ubiquinones function in conjunction with enzymes in cellular respiration (i.e., oxidation-reduction processes). The naturally occurring ubiquinones differ from each other only slightly in chemical structure, depending on the source, the structures resembling those of the fat-soluble vitamin K and certain derivatives of vitamin E.
