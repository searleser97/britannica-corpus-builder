Metal carbonyl,  any coordination or complex compound consisting of a heavy metal such as nickel, cobalt, or iron surrounded by carbonyl (CO) groups. Some common metal carbonyls include: tetracarbonylnickel Ni(CO)4, pentacarbonyliron Fe(CO)5, and octacarbonyldicobalt Co2(CO)8. In general, the metal carbonyls are produced by direct action of carbon monoxide on the finely divided metal. They are used in the preparation of metals of exceptionally high purity and as catalysts in organic syntheses.
The electronic structures of most metal carbonyls containing one metal atom per molecule (mononuclear carbonyls) bear striking resemblances to those of the noble-gas elements. For example, tetracarbonylnickel has 36 electrons (28 from the nickel atom and 8 electrons from the 4 carbonyl groups) surrounding the nickel nucleus. This number, called the effective atomic number (EAN), is also the total number of electrons in the noble-gas element krypton.
