Allemontite,   the mineral arsenic antimonide (AsSb). It commonly occurs in veins, as at Allemont, Isère, Fr.; Valtellina, Italy; and the Comstock Lode, Nevada. It also is present in a lithium pegmatite at Varuträsk, Swed. Polished sections of most specimens of allemontite show an intergrowth of allemontite with either pure arsenic in a vein occurrence or with nearly pure antimony in a pegmatite occurrence. Homogenous allemontite has also been found at Varuträsk. For detailed physical properties, see native element (table).
