Phosphorous acid (H3PO3), also called orthophosphorous acid,  one of several oxygen acids of phosphorus, used as reducing agent in chemical analysis. It is a colourless or yellowish crystalline substance (melting point about 73째 C, or 163째 F) with a garliclike taste. An unstable compound that readily absorbs moisture, it is converted to phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in the presence of oxygen or when heated above 180 째C (360 째F). Phosphorous acid (H3PO3) forms salts called phosphites, also used as reducing agents. It is prepared by dissolving tetraphosphorus hexoxide (P4O6) or phosphorus trichloride (PCl3) in water.
