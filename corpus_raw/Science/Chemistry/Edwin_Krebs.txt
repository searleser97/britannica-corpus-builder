Edwin Gerhard Krebs,  (born June 6, 1918, Lansing, Iowa, U.S.—died Dec. 21, 2009, Seattle, Wash.), American biochemist, winner with Edmond H. Fischer of the 1992 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. They discovered reversible protein phosphorylation, a biochemical process that regulates the activities of proteins in cells and thus governs countless processes that are necessary for life.
Krebs received a medical degree from Washington University (St. Louis, Mo.) in 1943 and did research there from 1946 to 1948 under the biochemists Carl and Gerty Cori. In 1948 he joined the faculty of biochemistry at the University of Washington, Seattle, and became a full professor in 1957. He moved in 1968  to the University of California at Davis and returned to the University of Washington in 1977.
During the 1950s Krebs and Edmond Fischer began investigating the process by which muscle cells obtain energy from glycogen (the form in which the body stores sugar). The Coris had previously demonstrated that cells use an enzyme called phosphorylase to release glucose (the source of energy in cell function) from glycogen. Krebs and Fischer showed that phosphorylase could be converted from an inactive to an active form by the addition of a phosphate group taken from the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The enzymes that catalyze this process are called protein kinases. Krebs and Fischer also showed that phosphorylase is inactivated by the removal of a phosphate group; this process is catalyzed by enzymes called phosphatases. Malfunctions in protein phosphorylation have been implicated in the causation of diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer disease.
Krebs was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute scientist from 1977 to 1990. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award (1989) and the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize (1989). Krebs also was a coeditor of the multivolume works The Enzymes (1970– ) and Protein Phosphorylation (1981).
