Enkephalin,  naturally occurring peptide that has potent painkilling effects and is released by neurons in the central nervous system and by cells in the adrenal medulla.
Enkephalins and closely related substances known as beta-endorphins were discovered when investigators postulated that since exogenous (produced outside of the human body) opiate substances such as morphine bind to cell surface receptors, there must exist endogenous (produced inside the human body) opiate-like substances that do likewise and therefore have a narcotic action. Therefore, beta-endorphin and enkephalins are known as endogenous opioids. These substances have powerful painkilling properties. The absence of pain in people who have sustained severe trauma is due to the rapid release and action of beta-endorphin in response to the stressful stimulus of the injury. In addition, the release of endorphin or enkephalin may account for the euphoria experienced by long-distance runners (“runner’s high”).
