Phosphine (PH3), also called hydrogen phosphide,  a colourless, flammable, extremely toxic gas with a disagreeable garliclike odour. Phosphine is formed by the action of a strong base or hot water on white phosphorus or by the reaction of water with calcium phosphide (Ca3P2). Phosphine is structurally similar to ammonia (NH3), but phosphine is a much poorer solvent than ammonia and is much less soluble in water.
Organic compounds with bonds between phosphorus and carbon or hydrogen are named as derivatives of phosphine: in primary, secondary, and tertiary phosphines, one, two, and three hydrogen atoms have been replaced by organic combining groups. Thus, methylphosphine (CH3PH2) is a primary phosphine, in which the methyl group (CH3) takes the place of one of the hydrogen atoms of phosphine itself. The metal salts are called phosphides, and the protonated forms (compounds to which a hydrogen ion has been added) are called phosphonium compounds. The organic derivatives of phosphine are usually made by substitution reactions using the readily available phosphorus trichloride (PCl3).
