Cofactor,   a component, other than the protein portion, of many enzymes. If the cofactor is removed from a complete enzyme (holoenzyme), the protein component (apoenzyme) no longer has catalytic activity. A cofactor that is firmly bound to the apoenzyme and cannot be removed without denaturing the latter is termed a prosthetic group; most such groups contain an atom of metal such as copper or iron. A cofactor that is bound loosely to the apoenzyme and can be readily separated from it is called a coenzyme. Coenzymes take part in the catalyzed reaction, are modified during the reaction, and may require another enzyme-catalyzed reaction for restoration to their original state.
