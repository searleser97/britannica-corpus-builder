Gibberellin,  any of a group of plant hormones that occur in seeds, young leaves, and roots. The name is derived from Gibberella fujikuroi, a hormone-producing fungus in the phylum Ascomycota that causes excessive growth and poor yield in rice plants. Evidence suggests that gibberellins stimulate the growth of main stems, especially when applied to the whole plant. They are also involved in the bolting (elongation) of rosette plants (e.g., lettuce) after exposure to certain environmental stimuli such as long periods of daylight.
Gibberellic acid, a gibberellin found in both higher plants and fungi, is commercially available for horticultural and home gardening uses. Minute applications can transform bush beans into pole beans or dwarf corn into normal corn. Perhaps the most widespread use has been in grape production. The application of gibberellin is a regular practice for the culture of the ‘Thompson Seedless’ (‘Sultanina’) cultivar of grapes to increase fruit size and is also used to induce seedlessness in certain other grape varieties.
