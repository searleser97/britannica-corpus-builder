Electrophile,   in chemistry, an atom or a molecule that in chemical reaction seeks an atom or molecule containing an electron pair available for bonding. Electrophilic substances are Lewis acids (compounds that accept electron pairs), and many of them are Brønsted acids (compounds that donate protons). Examples of electrophiles are hydronium ion (H3O+, from Brønsted acids), boron trifluoride (BF3), aluminum chloride (AlCl3), and the halogen molecules fluorine (F2), chlorine (Cl2), bromine (Br2), and iodine (I2). Compare nucleophile.
