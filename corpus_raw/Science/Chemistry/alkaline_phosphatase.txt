Alkaline phosphatase,   enzyme that is normally present in high concentrations in growing bone and in bile. It is essential for the deposition of minerals in the bones and teeth. Alkaline phosphatase deficiency is a hereditary trait called hypophosphatasia, which results in bone deformities. In severe cases, the deficiency leads to early death from infection. Alkaline phosphatase is also present in the blood and is an important clinical diagnostic indicator for several illnesses, including chronic myelogenous leukemia.
