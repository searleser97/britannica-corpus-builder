Molecular weight, also called molecular mass,  mass of a molecule of a substance, based on 12 as the atomic weight of carbon-12. It is calculated in practice by summing the atomic weights of the atoms making up the substanceâ€™s molecular formula. The molecular weight of a hydrogen molecule (chemical formula H2) is 2 (after rounding off); for many complex organic molecules (e.g., proteins, polymers) it may be in the millions.
