Sir John Cornforth,  (born September 7, 1917, Sydney, Australia—died December 8, 2013, Sussex, England), Australian-born British chemist who was corecipient, with  Vladimir Prelog, of the 1975 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his research on the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Stereochemistry is the study of how the properties of a chemical compound are affected by the spatial arrangement of atoms in molecules and complexes.
Cornforth suffered since childhood from a progressive hearing loss which later rendered him completely deaf. He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1937 and earned his doctorate from Oxford University in 1941, and in that same year he married Rita Harradence, an organic chemist, who helped him communicate and was his constant collaborator. During World War II he worked to determine the structure of the central molecule of the antibiotic penicillin. Cornforth remained at Oxford until 1946 and then joined the staff of the National Institute for Medical Research in London, where he remained until 1962.
He was codirector (1962–68) and director (1968–75) of the Milstead Laboratory of Chemical Enzymology for Shell Research Ltd., in Sittingbourne, Kent. He concurrently served as a professor at the University of Warwick (1965–71) and the University of Sussex (1971–82).
Cornforth investigated enzymes that catalyze change in organic compounds (substrates) by taking the place of hydrogen atoms in a substrate’s chains and rings. In his syntheses and descriptions of the structure of various terpenes, olefins, and steroids, he determined specifically which cluster of hydrogen atoms in a substrate is replaced by an enzyme to cause a given change in the substrate. This allowed Cornforth to detail the biosynthesis of cholesterol, an exceptionally complex molecule. He received the Nobel Prize in 1975 and was knighted in 1977.
