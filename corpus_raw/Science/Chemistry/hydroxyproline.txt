hydroxyproline,  an amino acid formed upon hydrolysis of connective-tissue proteins such as collagen (about 14 percent by weight) and elastin but rarely from other proteins. First isolated (1902) from gelatin, a breakdown product of collagen, hydroxyproline is one of several so-called nonessential amino acids; i.e., animals can synthesize it from glutamic acid and do not require dietary sources. Excretion of abnormal quantities of hydroxyproline is a symptom of the connective-tissue disease called Marfan syndrome. The molecular structure of hydroxyproline contains a secondary amino group (>NH) rather than the primary amino group (-NH2) characteristic of most amino acids and is as follows:
