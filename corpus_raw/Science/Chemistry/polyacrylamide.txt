polyacrylamide,  an acrylic resin that has the unique property of being soluble in water. It is employed in the treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater.
Polyacrylamides are produced by the polymerization of acrylamide (C3H5NO), a compound obtained by the hydration of acrylonitrile. Acrylamide is usually dissolved in water; it has toxic effects on the nervous system and must be handled under special protective procedures. The dissolved monomers (single-unit molecules) are induced to polymerize (link together to form large, multiple-unit molecules) through the action of free-radical initiators. In the resultant polymer, the acrylamide repeating unit has the following structure: .
Polyacrylamide does not have the toxic effects of acrylamide monomer. The polymer is hydrophilic (displays an affinity for water) and can form aqueous solutions of very high concentration. Because of their gel-like properties, these solutions are employed as flocculants in the removal of suspended particles from sewage and industrial effluents (e.g., wastewater from paper mills). Through the highly reactive amide (NH2) group, the polymer can be chemically modified to produce positively charged cationic polymer or negatively charged anionic polymer. Ionic polymers are especially useful in separating metals from residues in various mineral-processing and metallurgical operations.
