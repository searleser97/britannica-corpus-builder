Ziegler-Natta catalyst,   any of an important class of mixtures of chemical compounds remarkable for their ability to effect the polymerization of olefins (hydrocarbons containing a double carbonâ€“carbon bond) to polymers of high molecular weights and highly ordered (stereoregular) structures.
These catalysts were originated in the 1950s by the German chemist Karl Ziegler for the polymerization of ethylene at atmospheric pressure. Ziegler employed a catalyst consisting of a mixture of titanium tetrachloride and an alkyl derivative of aluminum. Giulio Natta, an Italian chemist, extended the method to other olefins and developed further variations of the Ziegler catalyst based on his findings on the mechanism of the polymerization reaction. The Ziegler-Natta catalysts include many mixtures of halides of transition metals, especially titanium, chromium, vanadium, and zirconium, with organic derivatives of nontransition metals, particularly alkyl aluminum compounds.
