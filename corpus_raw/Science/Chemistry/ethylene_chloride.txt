Ethylene chloride (C2H4Cl2), also called ethylene dichloride or 1,2-dichloroethane,  a colourless, toxic, volatile liquid having an odour resembling that of chloroform. It is denser than water, and it is practically insoluble in water.
Ethylene chloride is produced by the reaction of ethylene and chlorine. The annual production of ethylene chloride exceeds that of all other organohalogen compounds and ranks behind only that of ethylene and propylene among all organic compounds. Almost all ethylene chloride is converted to vinyl chloride for the production of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. The conversion of ethylene chloride to vinyl chloride is carried out at temperatures of about 500 °C (930 °F) in the presence of a catalyst.
