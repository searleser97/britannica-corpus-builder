law of definite proportions,  statement that every chemical compound contains fixed and constant proportions (by mass) of its constituent elements. Although many experimenters had long assumed the truth of the principle in general, the French chemist Joseph-Louis Proust first accumulated conclusive evidence for it in a series of researches on the composition of many substances, especially the oxides of iron (1797). Another French chemist, Claude Berthollet, who held for indefinite proportions, contested Proust’s findings, but the Scottish chemist Thomas Thomson confirmed some of them and wrote in his article “Chemistry” in the Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica (1801) that Proust had definitely proved “metals are not capable of indefinite degrees of oxidation.” The principle was then concretely formulated by the English chemist John Dalton in his chemical atomic theory (1808).
