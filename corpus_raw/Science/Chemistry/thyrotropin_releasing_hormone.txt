Thyrotropin-releasing hormone,  simplest of the hypothalamic neurohormones, consisting of three amino acids in the sequence glutamic acid–histidine–proline. The structural simplicity of thyrotropin-releasing hormone is deceiving because this hormone actually has many functions. It stimulates the synthesis and secretion of thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone) by the anterior pituitary gland. Given in high doses by injection, it stimulates the secretion of prolactin from the pituitary gland, although it does not appear to regulate the secretion of prolactin. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is also found throughout the brain and spinal cord, where it is thought to serve as a neuromodulator.
Thyrotropin-releasing hormone appeared very early in the evolution of vertebrates, and, while its concentration is highest in the hypothalamus, the total amount of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in the remainder of the brain far exceeds that in the hypothalamus. The nerve cells that produce thyrotropin-releasing hormone in the hypothalamus are subject to stimulatory and inhibitory influences from higher centres in the brain and from serum thyroid hormone concentrations, with low concentrations stimulating and high concentrations inhibiting the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. In this way, thyrotropin-releasing hormone forms the topmost component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Deficiency of thyrotropin-releasing hormone is a rare cause of hypothyroidism.
