Benzene hexachloride (BHC),  any of several stereoisomers of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane formed by the light-induced addition of chlorine to benzene. One of these isomers is an insecticide called lindane, or Gammexane.
Benzene hexachloride was first prepared in 1825; the insecticidal properties were identified in 1944 with the γ-isomer (gamma-isomer), which is about 1,000 times more toxic than any of the other diastereomers formed in the reaction. The structural differences between these individuals are in the orientations of the chlorine atoms with respect to the ring of carbon atoms.
The chemical addition of chlorine to benzene produces a mixture of several stereoisomers of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane. The γ-isomer, which makes up 20–25 percent of this mixture, is more soluble than the other isomers in certain solvents and can be separated from them. More volatile than DDT, BHC has a faster but less protracted action upon insects.
Lindane has been shown to accumulate in the food chain. This occurs because animals, including humans, eat foods grown in lindane-contaminated soils, and fishes and other marine life are exposed to lindane-contaminated waters. In fishes and mammals, exposure to high levels of lindane may cause acute poisoning, which is evidenced by nervous system dysfunction. Chronic exposure may adversely affect liver function in humans. Lindane’s use indoors in smoke fumigators is no longer permitted, and its use as an insecticide has been banned in many countries. Topical use in lotions to combat lice is permitted.
