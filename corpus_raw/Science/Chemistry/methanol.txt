Methanol (CH3OH), also called methyl alcohol, wood alcohol, or wood spirit,  the simplest of a long series of organic compounds called alcohols, consisting of a methyl group (CH3) linked with a hydroxy group (OH). Methanol was formerly produced by the destructive distillation of wood. The modern method of preparing methanol is based on the direct combination of carbon monoxide gas and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. Increasingly, syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide derived from biomass, is used for methanol production.
Pure methanol is an important material in chemical synthesis. Its derivatives are used in great quantities for building up a vast number of compounds, among them many important synthetic dyestuffs, resins, pharmaceuticals, and perfumes. Large quantities are converted to dimethylaniline for dyestuffs and to formaldehyde for synthetic resins. It is also used in automotive antifreezes, in rocket fuels, and as a general solvent. Methanol is also a high-octane, clean-burning fuel that is a potentially important substitute for gasoline in automotive vehicles. The methanol derived from wood is used chiefly for rendering industrial ethyl alcohol unfit to drink.
Methanol is a colourless liquid that boils at 64.96 °C (148.93 °F) and solidifies at −93.9 °C (−137 °F). It forms explosive mixtures with air and burns with a nonluminous flame. It is completely miscible in water. Methanol has an odour that is similar to ethyl alcohol, the intoxicant of alcoholic beverages, but is a dangerous poison; many cases of blindness or death have been caused by drinking mixtures containing it.
