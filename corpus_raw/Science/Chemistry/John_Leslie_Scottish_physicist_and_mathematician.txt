Sir John Leslie,  (born April 10, 1766, Largo, Fife, Scot.—died  Nov. 3, 1832, Coates), Scottish physicist and mathematician who first created artificial ice.
In 1802 Leslie’s explanation of capillary action was the first that is consistent with present-day theory. Two years later he published An Experimental Inquiry into the Nature and Propagation of Heat. In 1810 he froze water by using an air pump. Elected to the chair of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in 1805, he was transferred to the chair of natural philosophy in 1819 and was knighted in 1832.
