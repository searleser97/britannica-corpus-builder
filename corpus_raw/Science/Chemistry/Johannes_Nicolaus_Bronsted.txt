Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted,  (born Feb. 22, 1879, Varde, Den.—died  Dec. 17, 1947, Copenhagen), Danish physical chemist known for a widely applicable acid-base concept identical to that of Thomas Martin Lowry of England. Though both men introduced their definitions simultaneously (1923), they did so independently of each other. Brønsted was also an authority on the catalytic properties and strengths of acids and bases. His chief interest was thermodynamic studies, but he also did important work with electrolyte solutions.
The son of a civil engineer, Brønsted received his degree in chemical engineering (1899) and his doctorate in chemistry from the University of Copenhagen in 1908, when he also became a professor of physical and inorganic chemistry. He retained this position throughout his lifetime.
Brønsted was a visiting professor at Yale in 1929, and he became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1935. His firm opposition to Nazism during World War II won him election to the Danish Parliament (1947), but illness prevented him from taking his seat.
