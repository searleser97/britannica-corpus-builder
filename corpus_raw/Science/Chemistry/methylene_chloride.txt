Methylene chloride, also called dichloromethane,  a colourless, volatile, practically nonflammable liquid belonging to the family of organic halogen compounds. It is extensively used as a solvent, especially in paint-stripping formulations.
Methylene chloride is commercially produced along with methyl chloride, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride by the chlorination of methane. It boils at 40° C (104° F) at atmospheric pressure; it is denser than water and very slightly soluble in it. It is an effective solvent for fats, oils, greases, and many polymeric substances; its use is favoured by low toxicity, low flammability, high stability, and ease of recovery for reuse.
