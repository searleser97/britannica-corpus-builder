Butyl alcohol (C4H9OH),  any of four organic compounds having the same molecular formula but different structures: normal (n-) butyl alcohol, secondary (sec-) butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, and tertiary (t-) butyl alcohol.

All four of these alcohols have important industrial applications. n-Butyl alcohol is a solvent for paints, resins, and other coatings, and it is a component of hydraulic brake fluids. A large quantity of n-butyl alcohol is converted to esters, which have various applications; for example, butyl acetate is used as a paint solvent, and dibutyl phthalate is used as a plasticizer (to keep plastics from becoming brittle).
sec-Butyl alcohol is used in solvents and in esters to a limited extent; larger amounts are oxidized to methyl ethyl ketone (2-butanone), an important solvent for the manufacture of plastics, fabrics, and explosives. Similar to n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol is used in solvents and in plasticizers. Its esters are also used in fruit flavourings. t-Butyl alcohol is also used as a solvent and as a denaturing agent for ethyl alcohol. In smaller quantities it is used in flavourings and in perfumes.
Commercial n-butyl alcohol is made by fermentation of corn (maize) or molasses or by condensation and reduction of acetaldehyde. sec-Butyl alcohol is produced from butene by reaction with sulfuric acid, followed by hydrolysis. t-Butyl alcohol is similarly produced from isobutylene (2-methylpropene). Isobutyl alcohol can be made by the hydroformylation of propylene, giving isobutyraldehyde, followed by reduction.
