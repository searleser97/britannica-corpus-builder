Sir George Porter, Baron Porter of Luddenham,  (born December 6, 1920, Stainforth, Yorkshire, Englandâ€”died August 31, 2002, Canterbury), English chemist, corecipient with fellow Englishman Ronald George Wreyford Norrish and Manfred Eigen of West Germany of the 1967 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. All three were honoured for their studies in flash photolysis, a technique for observing the intermediate stages of very fast chemical reactions.
After undergraduate work at the University of Leeds, Porter earned a doctorate at the University of Cambridge under Norrish in 1949. He continued on there, developing the technique of flash photolysis with Norrish. In this technique, a gas or liquid in equilibrium is illuminated with an ultrashort burst of light that causes photochemical reactions in the substance. The extremely short-lived intermediate products of these reactions are illuminated by a second burst of light that enables an absorption spectrum to be taken of the reaction products before the gas has returned to a state of equilibrium. Porter specifically studied the equilibrium of chlorine atoms and molecules. In 1955 he joined the faculty of chemistry at the University of Sheffield, where he taught until 1966, becoming in that year director of the Royal Institution of Great Britain and Fullerian professor of chemistry. Porter was knighted in 1972 and created a life peer in 1990.
