Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS),  a hard, tough, heat-resistant engineering plastic that is widely used in appliance housings, luggage, pipe fittings, and automotive interior parts. Essentially a styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer modified by butadiene rubber, ABS combines the resilience of polybutadiene with the hardness and rigidity of polyacrylonitrile and polystyrene. ABS was patented in 1948 and introduced to commercial markets by the Borg-Warner Corporation in 1954.
ABS is a graft copolymerâ€”that is, a giant molecule predominantly made up of chains of polybutadiene growing from a backbone chain of styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer (SAN) amid more SAN that does not contain pendant polybutadiene. It is made by dissolving polybutadiene in liquid acrylonitrile and styrene monomers and then polymerizing the monomers by the introduction of free-radical initiators. ABS can also be made in an emulsion process, in which polybutadiene is prepared as a watery latex into which styrene and acrylonitrile are introduced and copolymerized. The precise amounts of each copolymer, the length of the polymer chains, and the degree of interlinking can be closely adjusted to product requirements. Essentially the three constituents provide a balance of properties, the butadiene units imparting good impact strength, the acrylonitrile units affording heat resistance, and the styrene units giving the copolymer its rigidity. ABS is regarded as a good engineering plastic (that is, a substitute for metals in structural parts). It can be injection-molded, blow-molded, or extruded.
