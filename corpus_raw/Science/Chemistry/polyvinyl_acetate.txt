polyvinyl acetate (PVAc),  a synthetic resin prepared by the polymerization of vinyl acetate. In its most important application, polyvinyl acetate serves as the film-forming ingredient in water-based (latex) paints; it also is used in adhesives.
Vinyl acetate (CH2=CHO2CCH3) is prepared from ethylene by reaction with oxygen and acetic acid over a palladium catalyst. Under the action of free-radical initiators, vinyl acetate monomers (single-unit molecules) can be linked into long, branched polymers (large, multiple-unit molecules), in which the structure of the vinyl acetate repeating units is: .
The monomer can be polymerized while dispersed in water to form a milky-white emulsion. This fluid can be processed directly into latex paints, in which the PVAc forms a strong, flexible, adherent film. It can also be made into a common household adhesive known as white glue or Elmerâ€™s glue.
When employed in coatings or adhesives, PVAc is often partially hydrolyzed to a water-soluble polymer known as polyvinyl alcohol.
