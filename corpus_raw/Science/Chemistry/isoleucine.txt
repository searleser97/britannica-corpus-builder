isoleucine,  an amino acid present in most common proteins, sometimes comprising 2 to 10 percent by weight. First isolated in 1904 from fibrin, a protein involved in blood-clot formation, isoleucine is one of several so-called essential amino acids for chicks, rats, and other higher animals, including man; i.e., they cannot synthesize it and require dietary sources. In microorganisms and plants, isoleucine is synthesized from the amino acid threonine. The chemical structure of isoleucine is
