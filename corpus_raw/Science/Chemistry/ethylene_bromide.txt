Ethylene bromide (C2H4Br2), also called ethylene dibromide or 1,2-dibromoethane,  a colourless, sweet-smelling, nonflammable, toxic liquid belonging to the family of organohalogen compounds. Ethylene bromide was once used in conjunction with lead-containing antiknock agents as a component of gasoline; however, this use disappeared with the banning of leaded gasoline. In addition, ethylene bromideâ€™s use as a soil fumigant for agriculture has been disallowed in the United States. Today the use of ethylene bromide is restricted primarily to the fumigation of felled logs and of beehives, although it may also be used as an intermediate in the production of waxes, dyes, and resins. Ethylene bromide is toxic to humans and animals, causing severe irritation to the eyes and skin and damage to the liver, kidneys, and lungs. As a result, most uses of ethylene bromide are regulated.
Ethylene bromide is prepared by the reaction of ethylene with bromine. It is denser than and very slightly soluble in water; however, it is soluble in many organic liquids.
