Thymine,   organic compound of the pyrimidine family that is a constituent of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA, along with RNA (ribonucleic acid), regulates hereditary characteristics in all living cells. Like the other nitrogenous components of nucleic acids, thymine is part of thymidine, a corresponding nucleoside (a structural unit composed of a nitrogen compound and a sugar), in which it is chemically linked with the sugar deoxyribose. It is also part of thymidylic acid, a nucleotide (a larger structural unit composed of a nucleoside and phosphoric acid), which is a phosphate ester of thymidine. The nucleotide, the nucleoside, or thymine itself may be prepared from DNA by selective techniques of hydrolysis.
