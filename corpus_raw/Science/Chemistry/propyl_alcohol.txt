propyl alcohol, also called n-propyl alcohol or 1-propanol,  one of two isomeric alcohols used as solvents and intermediates in chemical manufacturing. The second isomer is isopropyl alcohol (2-propanol).
Normal (n-) propyl alcohol is formed as a by-product of the synthesis of methanol (methyl alcohol) from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. It also occurs in fusel oil. Its largest use is as a solvent in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and in the preparation of lacquers. It easily forms esters and ethers, some of which are commercially important.
Propyl alcohol is a colourless, flammable, fragrant liquid that is miscible with water in all proportions and is moderately toxic.
