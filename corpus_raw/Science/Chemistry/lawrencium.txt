Lawrencium (Lr),  synthetic chemical element, the 14th member of the actinoid series of the periodic table, atomic number 103. Not occurring in nature, lawrencium (probably as the isotope lawrencium-257) was first produced (1961) by chemists Albert Ghiorso, T. Sikkeland, A.E. Larsh, and R.M. Latimer at the University of California, Berkeley, by bombarding a mixture of the longest-lived isotopes of californium (atomic number 98) with boron ions (atomic number 5) accelerated in a heavy-ion linear accelerator. The element was named after American physicist Ernest O. Lawrence. A team of Soviet scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna discovered (1965) lawrencium-256 (26-second half-life), which the Berkeley group later used in a study with approximately 1,500 atoms to show that lawrencium behaves more like the tripositive elements in the actinoid series than like predominantly dipositive nobelium (atomic number 102). The longest-lasting isotope, lawrencium-262, has a half-life of about 3.6 hours.
