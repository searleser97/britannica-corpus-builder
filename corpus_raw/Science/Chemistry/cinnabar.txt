Cinnabar,  mercury sulfide (HgS), the chief ore mineral of mercury. It is commonly encountered with pyrite, marcasite, and stibnite in veins near recent volcanic rocks and in hot-springs deposits. The most important deposit is at Almadén, Spain, where it has been mined for 2,000 years. Other deposits are in Huancavelica, Peru; Iudrio, Italy; and the Coast Ranges of California, U.S. Metacinnabar, the isometric (cubic) form of cinnabar, transforms to cinnabar upon heating to 400°–550° C (750°–1,020° F). For detailed physical properties, see sulfide mineral (table).
