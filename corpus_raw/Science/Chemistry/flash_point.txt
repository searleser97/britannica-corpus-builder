Flash point,  the lowest temperature at which a liquid (usually a petroleum product) will form a vapour in the air near its surface that will “flash,” or briefly ignite, on exposure to an open flame. The flash point is a general indication of the flammability or combustibility of a liquid. Below the flash point, insufficient vapour is available to support combustion. At some temperature above the flash point, the liquid will produce enough vapour to support combustion. (This temperature is known as the fire point.)
The use of the flash point as a measure of a liquid’s hazardousness dates from the 19th century. Before gasoline became important, kerosene was the main petroleum product (used mainly as fuel for lamps and stoves), and there was a tendency on the part of petroleum distillers to leave as much as possible of the commercially worthless gasoline in the kerosene in order to sell more product. This adulteration of kerosene with highly volatile gasoline caused numerous fires and explosions in storage tanks and oil lamps. Legal measures were instituted to curb the danger, and test methods were prescribed and minimum flash points set.
Flash points are measured by heating a liquid to specific temperatures under controlled conditions and then applying a flame. The test is done in either an “open cup” or a “closed cup” apparatus, or in both, in order to mimic the conditions of storage and the workplace. Representative liquids and their approximate flash points are:
Commercial products must adhere to specific flash points that have been set by regulating authorities.
