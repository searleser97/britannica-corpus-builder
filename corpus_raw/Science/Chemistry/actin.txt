Actin,  protein that is an important contributor to the contractile property of muscle and other cells. It exists in two forms: G-actin (monomeric globular actin) and F-actin (polymeric fibrous actin), the form involved in muscle contraction.
In muscle, two long strands of beadlike actin molecules are twisted together to form a thin filament, bundles of which alternate and interdigitate with bundles of thick filaments formed of myosin, the most abundant protein found in muscle. When a signal for muscle contraction is sent along a nerve to a muscle cell, actin and myosin are activated. Myosin works as a motor, hydrolyzing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to release energy in such a way that a myosin filament moves along an actin filament, causing the two filaments to slide past each other. Two other muscle proteins, tropomyosin and troponin, regulate the temporary fusion of actin and myosin that results in the contraction of muscle.
Actin filaments are also an important component of the cytoskeleton in various cell types, where they are dynamic structures, continuously assembling and disassembling. In nonmuscle cells, meshworks of actin filaments play a role in different types of cellular movement.
