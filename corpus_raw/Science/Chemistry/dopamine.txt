dopamine, also called hydroxytyramine,  a nitrogen-containing organic compound formed as an intermediate compound from dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) during the metabolism of the amino acid tyrosine. It is the precursor of the hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. Dopamine also functions as a neurotransmitter—primarily by inhibiting the transmission of nerve impulses—in the substantia nigra, basal ganglia, and corpus striatum of the brain.
A deficiency of dopamine associated with cellular death in the substantia nigra results in Parkinson disease. Dopamine-receptor agonists, which bind to dopamine receptors on dopamine-producing neurons in the neurotransmitter’s absence, can increase dopaminergic activity in the brain, helping to lessen Parkinson symptoms.
Abnormalities in dopamine transmission, including hyperactive dopamine transmission in certain parts of the brain, have been linked to psychotic syndromes such as schizophrenia. Dopaminergic structures within the brain, such as the striatum and nucleus accumbens, have also been implicated in reward-related behaviour.
