Condensation reaction,  any of a class of reactions in which two molecules combine, usually in the presence of a catalyst, with elimination of water or some other simple molecule. The combination of two identical molecules is known as self-condensation. Aldehydes, ketones, esters, alkynes (acetylenes), and amines are among several organic compounds that combine with each other and, except for amines, among themselves to form larger molecules, many of which are useful intermediate compounds in organic syntheses. Catalysts commonly used in condensation reactions include acids, bases, the cyanide ion, and complex metal ions.
