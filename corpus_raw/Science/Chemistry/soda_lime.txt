Soda lime,   white or grayish white granular mixture of calcium hydroxide with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Soda lime absorbs carbon dioxide and water vapour and deteriorates rapidly unless kept in airtight containers. Medically, soda lime is used to absorb carbon dioxide in basal metabolism tests and in rebreathing anesthesia systems. In gas masks it is an absorbent for toxic gases. It is used in laboratories as a drying agent. A highly corrosive poison, soda lime severely damages the gastrointestinal tract if swallowed and may cause death.
