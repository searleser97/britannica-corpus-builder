Luteinizing hormone (LH), also called interstitial-cell stimulating hormone (ICSH),  one of two gonadotropic hormones (i.e., hormones concerned with the regulation of the gonads, or sex glands) that is produced by the pituitary gland. LH is a glycoprotein and operates in conjunction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Following the release of the egg (ovulation) in the female, LH promotes the transformation of the graafian follicle (a small egg-containing vesicle in the ovary) into the corpus luteum, an endocrine gland that secretes progesterone. In the male, LH stimulates the development of the interstitial cells of the testes, which secrete testosterone, a male sex hormone. The production of LH is cyclical in nature (especially in the female). See also follicle-stimulating hormone; menstruation.
