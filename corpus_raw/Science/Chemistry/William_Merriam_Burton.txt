William Merriam Burton,  (born November 17, 1865, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.—died December 29, 1954, Miami, Florida), American chemist who developed a thermal cracking process for increasing the proportion of gasoline obtainable from petroleum.
Burton began work as a chemist at the Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) refinery at Whiting, Indiana, in 1890, rising swiftly to serve as president from 1918 to 1927. Crude oil, a mixture of various hydrocarbons of differing molecular weight, can be separated into several groups of constituents by physical means, commonly distillation. Burton’s thermal cracking process, patented in 1913, used high temperatures at high pressures to “crack,” or break down, heavier hydrocarbons into lighter molecules. By transforming many of the less-volatile components of crude oil into fractions suitable for blending into gasoline, the thermal cracking method was able to double the yield of that fuel. Although other techniques have since been developed, the Burton process is still widely used in petroleum refining.
