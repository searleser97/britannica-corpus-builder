Pierre-Joseph Pelletier,  (born March 22, 1788, Paris, Fr.—died  July 19, 1842, Paris), French chemist who helped found the chemistry of alkaloids.
Pelletier was professor at and, from 1832, director of the School of Pharmacy, Paris. In 1817, in collaboration with the chemist Joseph-Bienaimé Caventou, he isolated chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants that is essential to the process of photosynthesis. His interests soon turned to a new class of vegetable bases now called alkaloids, and he isolated emetine. With Caventou he continued his search for alkaloids, and in 1820 they discovered brucine, cinchonine, colchicine, quinine, strychnine, and veratrine. Some of these compounds soon found medicinal uses. Such applications marked the beginning of the gradual shift away from the use of crude plant extracts and toward the use of natural and synthetic compounds found in nature or formulated by the chemist.
In 1823 Pelletier published analyses of several alkaloids, thus providing a basis for alkaloid chemistry. He also did important studies of other compounds, including caffeine, piperine, and picrotoxin.
