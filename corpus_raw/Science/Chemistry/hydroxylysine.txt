hydroxylysine,  glycogenic amino acid uniquely found in collagen, the chief structural protein of mammalian skin and connective tissue, and in some similar structural plant proteins. The hydroxyl group of hydroxylysine forms a chemical bond with sugars, attaching galactose monosaccharides and glucosyl-galactose disaccharides to the protein, thus contributing to collagenâ€™s unusual toughness and resiliency. Collagen is insoluable, but heat denaturation (boiling in water, dilute acids, or alkalies) yields digestible, soluble gelatin. The chemical structure of hydroxylysine is
