Fischer projection,  method of representing the three-dimensional structures of molecules on a page, devised by Emil Fischer. By convention, horizontal lines represent bonds projecting from the plane of the paper toward the viewer, and vertical lines represent bonds projecting away from the viewer. Fischer projections are a convenient way to depict chiral molecules (see optical activity) and distinguish between pairs of enantiomers (see racemic mixture). They are most often used to depict isomers of the sugars. See also chemical formula.
