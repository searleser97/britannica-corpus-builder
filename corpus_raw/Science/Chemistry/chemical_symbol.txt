Chemical symbol,   short notation derived from the scientific name of a chemical element—e.g., S for sulfur and Si for silicon. Sometimes the symbol is derived from the Latin name—e.g., Au for aurum, gold, and Na for natrium, sodium. The present chemical symbols express the systematizing of chemistry by the atomic theory of matter. The English chemist John Dalton, who followed the alchemists in representing the elements pictorially, made the important advance of letting his symbols designate single atoms of elements, not indefinite amounts.
The Scottish chemist Thomas Thomson was the first to use letters as chemical symbols in the article “Mineralogy” in the Supplement (1801) to the 3rd edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. The Swedish scientist J.J. Berzelius proposed in 1813 that chemical symbols be based on the Latin names of the elements, a proposal generally adopted by the mid-19th century.
