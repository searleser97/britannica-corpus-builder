Vinyl fluoride (H2C=CHF), also called fluoroethylene,  a colourless, flammable, nontoxic, chemically stable gas belonging to the family of organohalogen compounds and used as the starting material in making polyvinyl fluoride, a plastic used in films for weather-resistant coatings of structural materials. Vinyl fluoride is prepared from acetylene and hydrogen fluoride by direct reaction in the presence of HgCl2 or by first treating acetylene with excess hydrogen fluoride to form CH3CHF2, which is then converted to H2C=CHF by heating at 700 °C (1,300 °F). Vinyl fluoride is also prepared by the reaction of vinyl chloride with hydrogen fluoride to give 1-chloro-1-fluoroethane, followed by dehydrochlorination at 500–600 °C (930–1,100 °F).
