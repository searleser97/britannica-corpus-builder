Phosphofructokinase,  enzyme that is important in regulating the process of fermentation, by which one molecule of the simple sugar glucose is broken down to two molecules of pyruvic acid. The enzyme, one of a class called transferases, catalyzes one of several specific reactions involved in this breakdownâ€”the formation of fructose-1,6-diphosphate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) from fructose-6-phosphate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP); its activity is sensitive to the ATP/ADP ratio in the cell.
