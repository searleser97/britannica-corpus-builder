thiamin, also spelled thiamine, also called vitamin B1,  water-soluble organic compound that is necessary for carbohydrate metabolism in both plants and animals. It carries out these functions in its active form, as a component of the coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate. Thiamin deficiency results in beriberi, a disease characterized by multiple neuritis (lesions of nerves), general debility, and heart failure.
In 1926 thiamin was the first vitamin to be isolated in pure form. Its structure was fully elucidated and the vitamin synthesized in 1936. The chemical structure is as follows:
Thiamin is found most abundantly in cereal grains and in certain other seeds. In many countries, white rice and white wheat flour are now fortified with synthetic thiamin. Pork is one of the richest animal sources. The recommended daily intake of thiamin is 1.0 to 1.4 mg (1 mg = 0.001 gram) for adult humans. (See table of the vitamins.)
