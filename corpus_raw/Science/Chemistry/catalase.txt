Catalase,  an enzyme that brings about (catalyzes) the reaction by which hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to water and oxygen. Found extensively in organisms that live in the presence of oxygen, catalase prevents the accumulation of and protects cellular organelles and tissues from damage by peroxide, which is continuously produced by numerous metabolic reactions. In mammals, catalase is found predominantly in the liver.
Catalase has various industrial applications. In the food industry, it is used in combination with other enzymes in the preservation of foodstuffs and in the manufacture of beverages and certain food items. Commercial catalases also are used to break down hydrogen peroxide in wastewater.
