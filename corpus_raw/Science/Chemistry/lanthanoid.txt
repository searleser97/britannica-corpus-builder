Lanthanoid, also called lanthanide,  any of the series of 15 consecutive chemical elements in the periodic table from lanthanum to lutetium (atomic numbers 57â€“71). With scandium and yttrium, they make up the rare-earth metals. Their atoms have similar configurations and similar physical and chemical behaviour; the most common valences are 3 and 4. These elements are also called the lanthanide elements. However, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, the international body in charge of chemical nomenclature, prefers the term lanthanoid, since the -ide ending is usually reserved for negatively charged ions.
