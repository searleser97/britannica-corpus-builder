Inversion,   in chemistry, the spatial rearrangement of atoms or groups of atoms in a dissymmetric molecule, giving rise to a product with a molecular configuration that is a mirror image of that of the original molecule.
The reaction is usually one in which an atom or a group of atoms in the molecule is replaced by another atom or group. The phenomenon of inversion is sometimes known as Walden inversion, after the German chemist Paul Walden, who discovered it in 1895. The idea that inversion is the stereochemical consequence of a nucleophilic displacement reaction was introduced by the British chemists Sir Christopher Ingold and E.D. Hughes (see substitution reaction).
