Darmstadtium (Ds),  artificially produced transuranium element of atomic number 110. In 1995 scientists at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft f√ºr Schwerionenforschung [GSI]) in Darmstadt, Germany, announced the formation of atoms of element 110 when lead-208 was fused with nickel-62. The atoms of element 110 had an atomic weight of 269 and decayed after 260 microseconds (1 microsecond = 1 millionth of a second) into atoms of hassium-265 by emitting an alpha particle (helium nucleus). Element 110 was named darmstadtium after the German city where the GSI is located. Several other isotopes of darmstadtium are known; the longest-lasting, darmstadtium-281, has a half-life of about 20 seconds. Its chemical properties may be similar to those of platinum.
