Karl Bühler,  (born May 27, 1879, Meckesheim, Baden, Germany—died October 24, 1963, Los Angeles, California, U.S.), German psychiatrist and psychologist who was known chiefly for his studies of the thought process.
Bühler received a medical degree from the University of Strasbourg, studied psychology at the University of Berlin and the University of Bonn, and then taught at several German universities before World War I. His seminal paper, “Über Gedanken” (1907; “On Thoughts”), was a major contribution to the Würzburg school of imageless thought; it demonstrated that the mind is capable of purely abstract thinking and does not need to use images or past observations to conceive of an idea. Bühler made his subjects think by having them read a passage from Nietzsche or by asking them questions and timing their answers, then asking them to describe the experience. He called this experimental technique the Ausfragemethode—“inquiry method.” After serving in the German Army during World War I, Bühler was named professor of psychiatry at the University of Vienna in 1922. He was forced to flee to Norway in 1938, and he reached the United States in 1939, residing there until his death. While there he expanded his paper of 1907 into a book, Facts and Problems of the Psychology of the Thought Process.
