Anna Jean Ayres,  (born 1920, Visalia, California, U.S.—died December 16, 1988, Los Angeles), American occupational therapist and clinical psychologist who pioneered the development of therapy for individuals with neurological impairments in sensory integration. Her work with children with cerebral palsy and learning disabilities led to the development of sensory integration theory, which attempts to explain the role of sensations, such as touch, movement, sight, and sound, in human behaviour. Children with sensory integration problems may exhibit insecurity or fear of movement and, consequently, can have difficulty with ordinary activities such as play and self-care. The term sensory integration is also used to refer to the clinical specialty that emerged from Ayres’s work, which includes various assessments used to identify sensory integration dysfunction and interventions used to improve function.
During her career, Ayres wrote several books, including Sensory Integration and Learning Disorders (1972) and Sensory Integration and the Child (1979), and published multiple scholarly articles addressing her theory and techniques for clinical application. She also founded the Ayres Clinic, based in Torrance, California, where she evaluated and treated children using the approach she developed. Sensory integration therapy stresses detailed evaluation and understanding of each child’s unique sensory style and challenges, which serves as a basis for providing the child with appropriate learning opportunities for processing and using sensory information to enhance skill in performance.
Sensory integration theory has continued to evolve and is an extensively researched and developed model of practice in occupational therapy. Remediation of impairment, environmental adaptation, and personal management of sensory challenges are considered to be components of intervention for sensory intergration.
