Sir Nevile Meyrick Henderson,  (born June 10, 1882, Horsham, Sussex, Eng.—died  Dec. 30, 1942, London), British ambassador in Berlin (1937–39) who was closely associated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement toward Nazi Germany. Some observers believed that he was more influential in implementing the appeasement policy than Chamberlain himself.
Henderson joined the diplomatic service in 1905, serving as minister in Egypt (1924–28), France (1928–29), and Yugoslavia (1929–35). Promoted to ambassador to Argentina in 1935, he was transferred in 1937 to Germany. In Berlin he worked under severe nervous strain and was seriously ill in the winter of 1938. He was knighted in 1932 and made a privy councillor in 1937.
Partly because he had little respect for the European policy of France after World War I, Henderson was inclined to favour the German claims set forth by Adolf Hitler to justify Nazi aggression. He further believed it was neither his nor the British government’s proper role to criticize the government to which he was accredited. He also was friendly with several Nazi leaders, especially Hermann Göring. Evidently disbelieving that Hitler wished to rule all Europe, he supported the Munich Agreement of Sept. 30, 1938, but was disillusioned by the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. During the summer of 1939 he tried repeatedly to dissuade Hitler from attacking Poland and precipitating a war with Britain and France. On the outbreak of war he returned to England and declined further office because of ill health.
Henderson published his own account of the final prewar phase of Nazi aggression in Failure of a Mission (1940). His autobiography, Water Under the Bridges, was published posthumously in 1945.
