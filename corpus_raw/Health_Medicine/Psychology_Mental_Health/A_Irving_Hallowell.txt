A. Irving Hallowell,  (born Dec. 28, 1892, Philadelphia—died  Oct. 10, 1974, Philadelphia), U.S. cultural anthropologist known for his work on the North American Indians, especially the Ojibwa.
Hallowell received his early training at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of Pennsylvania and was a social worker in Philadelphia while doing graduate work in sociology and anthropology.
From his early ethnographic work, which was heavily influenced by his instructors Frank G. Speck and Franz Boas, he turned to a study of “culture and personality,” the psychological dimensions of acculturation, in which he used Rorschach and other projective tests. He drew upon Freudian and Gestalt theory to show how social order is a product of the cultural environment.
