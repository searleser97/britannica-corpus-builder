H.H. Price, in full Henry Habberley Price,  (born 1899, Neath, Glamorgan, Wales—died  Nov. 26, 1985), British philosopher noted for his study of perception and thinking.
Before his appointment as Wykeham professor of logic at New College, Oxford (1935–59), where he was educated, Price taught at Magdalen College (1922–24), Liverpool University (1922–23), and Trinity College (1924–35). His earliest book, Perception (1932), rejected causal theories of perception, while a later publication, Thinking and Experience (1953), revealed the importance of conceptual awareness beyond mere symbolic interpretation. Also writing on religion, parapsychology, and psychic phenomena, he viewed telepathy and clairvoyance as influences on the unconscious mind. Additional works include Hume’s Theory of the External World (1940), Belief (1969), and Essays in the Philosophy of Religion (1972).
