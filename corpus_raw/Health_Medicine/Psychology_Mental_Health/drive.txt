Drive,  in psychology, an urgent basic need pressing for satisfaction, usually rooted in some physiological tension, deficiency, or imbalance (e.g., hunger and thirst) and impelling the organism to action. Some researchers have used the term need synonymously, although others distinguish between need as the deprived state and drive as its psychological manifestations (e.g., tension and restless or goal-directed activity). Psychologists also distinguish between drives that are innate and directly related to basic physiological needs (e.g., food, air, and water) and drives that are learned (e.g., drug addiction). Among the other drives or needs that have been proposed are achievement, activity, affection, affiliation, curiosity, elimination, exploration, manipulation, maternity, pain avoidance, sex, and sleep.
In the 1940s U.S. psychologist Clark Hull proposed a drive-reduction theory of learning. In its simplest form, the theory claimed that no learning occurred unless a drive produced tension and impelled the organism into activity to procure a reward that would reduce the drive and satisfy its related physiological need. Later research suggests, however, that learning may also occur in the absence of any drive. See also motivation.
