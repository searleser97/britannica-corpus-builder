Henry Murray, in full Henry Alexander Murray,  (born May 13, 1893, New York, New York, U.S.—died June 23, 1988, Cambridge, Massachusetts), American psychologist who developed a theory of human personality based on an individual’s inborn needs and his relationship with the physical and social environment.
Murray, who majored in history at Harvard University, earned an M.D. in 1919 from Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons, an M.A. in biology from Columbia, and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Cambridge (1927). His interest in psychology was sparked when he began reading the works of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud. He began teaching psychology at Harvard University in 1927 and served as director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic from 1929 until 1938, when he published his best-known book, Explorations in Personality.
He developed a tool for evaluating personality called the Thematic Apperception Test, which was hailed as an important contribution to analytical psychology. Because studies indicated that individuals are likely to interpret events according to their own experience, Murray’s test had subjects interpret a series of pictures. After his retirement from Harvard (1962), he continued lecturing and studying the works of author Herman Melville.
