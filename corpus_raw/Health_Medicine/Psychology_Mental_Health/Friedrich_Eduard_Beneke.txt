Friedrich Eduard Beneke,  (born Feb. 17, 1798, Berlin, Prussia [now in Germany]—died  March 1, 1854, Berlin),  German philosopher and psychologist who argued that inductive psychology was the foundation for the study of all philosophical disciplines. He rejected the existing idealism for a form of associationism influenced by both Kant and Locke.
Beneke studied theology and philosophy at the universities of Halle and Berlin. His first anti-Hegelian books, Erkenntnislehre nach dem Bewusstsein der reinen Vernunft (1820; “Theory of Knowledge According to the Consciousness of Pure Reason”) and Erfahrungsseelenlehre als Grundlage alles Wissens (1820; “Experiential Theory of the Soul as the Foundation of All Knowledge”), hindered his admittance into the academic community until his appointment at the University of Berlin in 1832 as professor of philosophy. His other important works include Psychologische Skizzen, 2 vol. (1825–27; “Psychological Sketches”), Grundlinien des natürlichen Systems der praktischen Philosophie (1837; “Essentials of Natural Systems of Practical Philosophy”), and Pragmatische Psychologie (1850; “Pragmatic Psychology”).
