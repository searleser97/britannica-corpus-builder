Projective test,  in psychology, examination that commonly employs ambiguous stimuli, notably inkblots (Rorschach Test) and enigmatic pictures (Thematic Apperception Test), to evoke responses that may reveal facets of the subjectâ€™s personality by projection of internal attitudes, traits, and behaviour patterns upon the external stimuli. Projective tests are also used, less frequently, to study learning processes. Other projective methods involve requiring subjects to build wooden block structures, complete sentences, paint with the fingers, or provide handwriting samples; additional methods include association tests in which spoken words serve as the stimuli.
The usefulness and reliability of projective tests depend on a number of factors, including the extent to which identical personality interpretations can be reached by different evaluators using the same test data and the extent to which those interpretations are supported by assessments of personality from other sources (e.g., personality inventories and clinical observation). In consideration of such factors, psychologists are sharply divided over the value of projective tests, despite their prominence in both personality research and therapeutic practice.
