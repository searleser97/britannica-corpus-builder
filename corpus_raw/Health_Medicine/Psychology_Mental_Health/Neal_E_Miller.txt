Neal E. Miller, in full Neal Elgar Miller,  (born August 3, 1909, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.—died March 23, 2002, Hamden, Connecticut), American psychologist, who, with John Dollard, developed a theory of motivation based on the satisfaction of psychosocial drives by combining elements of a number of earlier reinforcement theories of behaviour and learning.
Miller attended the University of Washington (B.S., 1931) and Stanford University (M.S., 1932) before receiving a Ph.D. in psychology from Yale University in 1935. He remained at Yale’s Institute of Human Relations to continue his experiments on learning. In Social Learning and Imitation (1941) and Personality and Psychotherapy (1950), he and Dollard presented their results, which suggested that behaviour patterns were produced through the modification of biologically or socially derived drives by conditioning and reinforcement. Miller was appointed professor of psychology at Yale in 1950, resigning the position in 1966 to accept a professorship at Rockefeller University (emeritus from 1981). In 1985 he became a research affiliate at Yale University. Miller received numerous honours throughout his career, including the National Medal of Science (1964) and a lifetime achievement award from the American Psychological Association (1991).
