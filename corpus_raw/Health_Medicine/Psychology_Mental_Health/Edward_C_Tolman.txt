Edward C. Tolman, in full Edward Chace Tolman,  (born April 14, 1886, West Newton, Massachusetts, U.S.—died November 19, 1959, Berkeley, California), American psychologist who developed a system of psychology known as purposive, or molar, behaviourism, which attempts to explore the entire action of the total organism.
Brother of the chemist and physicist Richard C. Tolman, Edward Tolman taught psychology at the University of California, Berkeley (1918–54). Although influenced by a number of other psychologists, including Edwin B. Holt, his system perhaps owes one of its most obvious debts to Gestalt psychology, which strives to understand the components of mental life as structured wholes. About 1922 he began to assert that the stimulus-response behaviourism of John B. Watson was too limited, because it selected the conditioned reflex as the unit of habit. Tolman advanced his system in his major work, Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men (1932). He suggested that the unit of behaviour is the total, goal-directed act, using varied muscular movements that are organized around the purposes served and guided by cognitive processes. His system remained behaviourist by its adherence to objective observation and rigorous experimental procedures.
