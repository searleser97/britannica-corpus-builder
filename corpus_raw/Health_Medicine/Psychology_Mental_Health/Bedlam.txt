Bedlam, byname of Bethlem Royal Hospital,  the first asylum for the mentally ill in England. It is currently located in Beckenham, Kent. The word bedlam came to be used generically for all psychiatric hospitals and sometimes is used colloquially for an uproar.
In 1247 the asylum was founded at Bishopsgate, just outside the London wall, by Simon FitzMary, former sheriff of London; it was then known as the Priory of St. Mary of Bethlehem (from which sprang the variant spellings Bedlam and Bethlem). Bedlam was mentioned as a hospital in 1329, and some permanent patients were accommodated there by 1403. In 1547 it was granted by Henry VIII to the City of London as a hospital for the mentally ill. It subsequently became infamous for the brutal ill treatment meted out to its patients. In the 17th and 18th centuries Bedlam was open to fee-paying spectators, but this disruptive practice was ended in 1770. The hospital was moved in 1675–76 to Moorfields (just north of the ancient London wall at Moorgate), in 1815 to St. George’s Fields (now in Southwark), and in 1930 to Monks Orchard, Beckenham. Now a part of the National Health Service, it is linked administratively with the Maudsley Hospital. Since 1936 the old hospital building in Southwark has been the site of the Imperial War Museum.
