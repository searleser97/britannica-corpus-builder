George Herbert Mead,  (born Feb. 27, 1863, South Hadley, Mass., U.S.—died  April 26, 1931, Chicago), American philosopher prominent in both social psychology and the development of Pragmatism.
Mead studied at Oberlin College and Harvard University. During 1891–94 he was instructor in philosophy and psychology at the University of Michigan. In 1894 he went to the University of Chicago, where he remained until his death.
To social psychology, Mead’s main contribution was his attempt to show how the human self arises in the process of social interaction. He thought that spoken language played a central role in this development. Through language the child can take the role of other persons and guide his behaviour in terms of the effect his contemplated behaviour will have upon others. Thus Mead’s psychological approach was behaviouristic.
In philosophy, Mead was one of the major thinkers among the American Pragmatists. In common with a number of his contemporaries, he was much-influenced by the theory of relativity and the doctrine of emergence. His philosophy might be called objective Relativism. Just as some objects are edible, but only in relation to a digestive system, so Mead thought of experience, life, consciousness, personality, and value as objective properties of nature which emerge only under (and hence are relative to) specific sets of conditions. John Dewey acknowledged his own great indebtedness to Mead’s philosophy.
Mead never published his work. After his death his students edited four volumes from stenographic recordings and notes on his lectures and from unpublished papers: The Philosophy of the Present (1932); Mind, Self, and Society (1934); Movements of Thought in the Nineteenth Century (1936); and The Philosophy of the Act (1938).
