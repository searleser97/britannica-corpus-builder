Ulrich Wille,  (born April 5, 1848, Hamburg—died  Jan. 31, 1925, Meilen, Switz.), Swiss military leader and commander in chief of the Swiss Army during World War I who made major federal military reforms.
Wille studied the organization of the Prussian Army in Berlin and attempted various changes in the federal army along Prussian lines. He reorganized the process of recruit instruction and in 1881, while a lieutenant colonel, undertook the reform of the cavalry, subsequently publishing a new cavalry code (1892). The “Wille spirit” was often publicly attacked, however, and, when a military law favoured by him failed to win popular support (1895), he resigned his recently acquired positions as head and chief instructor of the army. In 1900, however, he resumed active service. At the outbreak of World War I, he was—in an act of doubtful constitutionality (August 1914)—named general and appointed commander in chief of the Swiss Army and directed the occupation of the frontiers until the war’s end. He is generally credited with having replaced the old tradition of the Swiss citizens’ army with the concept of strict military duty and discipline.
