Cynthia Macdonald, née Cynthia Lee,  (born February 2, 1928, New York, New York, U.S.—died August 3, 2015, Logan, Utah), American poet who employed a sardonic, often flippant tone and used grotesque imagery to comment on the mundane.
Lee was educated at Bennington (Vermont) College (B.A., 1950); Mannes College of Music, New York City; and Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York (M.A., 1970). She pursued a career as a soprano in opera and concert singing from 1953 to 1966. During that time she married (1954) Elmer Cranston Macdonald, an oil executive; they divorced in 1976. She taught English at Sarah Lawrence College (1970–75) and at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland (1975–79). In 1979 Macdonald cofounded the creative writing program at the University of Houston, serving as codirector. She later attended the Houston-Galveston (Texas) Psychoanalytic Institute. After being certified (1986) as a psychoanalyst, she went into private practice, specializing in treating people who suffered from writer’s block.
Amputations (1972), her first published volume of poetry, attracted attention with its startling imagery. Almost all the poems in the collection concern misfits who have undergone physical amputation or who feel disassociated from society. Continuing the theme of separateness and alienation, Macdonald placed the subjects of her poems in Transplants (1976) in threatening strange environments. (W)holes (1980) also focuses on grotesques and incongruous surroundings. Her later poetic works include Alternate Means of Transport (1985), Living Wills (1991), and I Can’t Remember (1997). She also wrote the libretto for The Rehearsal (1978), an opera by Thomas Benjamin. Macdonald was honoured (1977) with an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature.
