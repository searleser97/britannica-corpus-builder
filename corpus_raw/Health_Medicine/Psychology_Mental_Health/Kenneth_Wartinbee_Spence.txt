Kenneth Wartinbee Spence,  (born May 6, 1907, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died January 12, 1967, Austin, Texas), American psychologist who attempted to construct a comprehensive theory of behaviour to encompass conditioning and other simple forms of learning and behaviour modification.
Spence was raised and educated in Canada, returning to the United States in 1930 to study at Yale University, where he received his doctorate three years later with Clark L. Hull. He began his behavioral studies at the Yale Laboratories of Primate Biology in Orange Park, Florida, and from 1938 continued them at the State University of Iowa (now the University of Iowa), where he became head of the psychology department in 1942. In 1964 he left Iowa to head the psychology department at the University of Texas at Austin.
Spence’s work convinced him that discrimination learning takes place by establishing connections between specific stimuli and responses, reinforced by a reward when the proper response is given. In Behavior Theory and Conditioning (1956), he related his findings to behaviour in general, as well as to specific learning systems. The strength of learning potential, in Spence’s view, is dependent both on the strength of the drive (such as hunger or sex) that the response satisfies and on the strength of the incentive, the chief variables of which are the amount of reinforcement given and the delay between the response and the reward.
