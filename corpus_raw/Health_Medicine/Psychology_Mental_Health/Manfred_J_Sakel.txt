Manfred J. Sakel, in full Manfred Joshua Sakel,  (born June 6, 1900, Nadvorna, Austria-Hungary [now Nadvirna, Ukr.]â€”died  Dec. 2, 1957, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Polish neurophysiologist and psychiatrist who introduced insulin-shock therapy for schizophrenia.
Sakel received his medical training at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1925, and subsequently practiced in both Vienna and Berlin. He became a research associate at the University Neuropsychiatric Clinic in Vienna in 1933. He was forced to flee the Nazis in 1936 and completed his work at the Harlem Valley State Hospital in the United States, publishing his findings in The Pharmacological Shock Treatment of Schizophrenia (1938).
Sakel had used insulin to tranquilize morphine addicts undergoing withdrawal, and in 1927 one addict accidentally received an overdose of insulin and went into a coma. After the patient recovered from the overdose, Sakel noted an improvement in his mental state. Sakel hypothesized that inducing convulsions with insulin could have similar effects in schizophrenics. His initial studies found the treatment effective in 88 percent of his patients, and the method was applied widely for a brief period. Follow-up studies showed the long-term results to be less satisfactory, and insulin-shock treatment was replaced by other methods of treatment.
