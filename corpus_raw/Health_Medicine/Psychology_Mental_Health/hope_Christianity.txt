Hope,  in Christian thought, one of the three theological virtues, the others being faith and charity (love). It is distinct from the latter two because it is directed exclusively toward the future, as fervent desire and confident expectation. When hope has attained its object, it ceases to be hope and becomes possession. Consequently, whereas “love never ends,” hope is confined to man’s life on Earth.
The ancient Greeks used the term hope (elpis) in reference to an ambiguous, open-ended future; but the Resurrection of Jesus Christ gave the term, for Christians, a positive expectation and a moral quality. Throughout the New Testament, Christian hope is closely tied to the ultimate hope of the return of Jesus Christ as the judge of the living and the dead. Yet this eschatological hope does not eliminate intermediate hopes for lesser goods, even for material blessings.
Generally, Christian manuals of doctrine and ethics have given more attention to faith and charity than to a detailed discussion of hope as such. Nevertheless, at certain periods in the history of Christianity the eschatological conviction that the end was near combined with the hope that Jesus would return and usher in his kingdom of peacereign of peace. The mid-20th-century “theology of hope,” exemplified by the German theologian Jürgen Moltmann, was a major movement.
