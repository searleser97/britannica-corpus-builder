George S. Klein, in full George Stuart Klein,  (born July 15, 1917, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died April 11, 1971, Stockbridge, Massachusetts), American psychologist and psychoanalyst best known for his research in perception and psychoanalytic theory.
Klein received a B.A. from the City College of New York in 1938 and a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia University in 1942. During the next four years he served in the United States Army Air Corps as an aviation psychologist. As a staff member of the Menninger School of Psychiatry (1946–51) in Topeka, Kansas, he received training in psychoanalytically oriented clinical psychology and performed research guided by the so-called “new look” paradigm, which maintained that perception, cognition, and personality interact in complex ways. In 1953 he joined the faculty of New York University (NYU), where he became codirector of the Research Center for Mental Health.
Probably his best-known research concerned cognitive controls, which are consistent tendencies of people to process information in certain ways. Regarding perception, for example, Klein and his colleagues discovered that people fall into two general categories: levelers, who perceive similarities between things and overlook differences, and sharpeners, who see contrasts and maintain a high level of awareness of differences between stimuli. In 1951 Klein and Herbert J. Schlesinger introduced the term cognitive style to refer to the combination of several cognitive controls within a single person. Klein also did research on subliminal (below consciousness) perception and altered states of consciousness. Throughout his career, he tried to adapt the experimental methods characteristic of cognitive psychology to the study of psychoanalytic ego psychology (based on the theories of Sigmund Freud).
Two of his more influential books are Perception, Motives, and Personality (1970) and Psychoanalytic Theory: An Exploration of Essentials (1975).
