Johannes Nikolaus Tetens,  (born Sept. 16, 1736, Tetenbüll, South Schleswig [Germany]—died  Aug. 15/19, 1807, Copenhagen, Den.), German psychologist, mathematician, economist, educator, and empiricist philosopher who strongly influenced the work of Immanuel Kant.
Tetens became professor of physics at Bützow University in 1760 and five years later was made director of the Pädagogium (“Academy”) there. In 1776 he was appointed professor of philosophy at the University of Kiel, where he later held the chair of mathematics. He gave up teaching in 1789 to enter public service, becoming assessor and then councillor of state and deputy in the Danish Ministry of Finance in Copenhagen.
Tetens’ major work, Philosophische Versuche über die menschliche Natur und ihre Entwickelung (1777; “Philosophical Experiments on Human Nature and Its Development”), shows the influence of Kant’s Dissertation (1770). The Philosophische Versuche is essentially an investigation of the origin and structure of human knowledge and was the most important philosophical work written in Germany during the period immediately prior to the publication of the Critique of Pure Reason (1781) by Kant, who valued Tetens’ work highly. Kant reiterated Tetens’ emphasis on the importance of empirical foundations for philosophical studies. He was also influenced in the construction of his own theory of human knowledge by Tetens’ threefold division of consciousness into the faculties of feeling, will, and understanding. By the last category he referred to the faculty of forming and combining ideas.
Tetens subsequently became the only major German thinker to embrace, with some modifications, the empirical psychology then in style in Great Britain and France, particularly as found in the work of David Hume. Tetens also wrote Über die allgemeine spekulativische Philosophie (1775; “On General Speculative Philosophy”).
