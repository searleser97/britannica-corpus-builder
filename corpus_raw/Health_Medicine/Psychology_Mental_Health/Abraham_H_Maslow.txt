Abraham Maslow, in full Abraham Harold Maslow, also called Abraham H. Maslow,  (born April 1, 1908, New York, New York, U.S.—died June 8, 1970, Menlo Park, California), American psychologist and philosopher best known for his self-actualization theory of psychology, which argued that the primary goal of psychotherapy should be the integration of the self.
Maslow studied psychology at the University of Wisconsin and Gestalt psychology at the New School for Social Research in New York City before joining the faculty of Brooklyn College in 1937. In 1951 he became head of the psychology department at Brandeis University (Waltham, Massachusetts), where he remained until 1969.
Influenced by existentialist philosophers and literary figures, Maslow was an important contributor in the United States to humanistic psychology, which was sometimes called the “third force,” in opposition to behaviourism and psychoanalysis.
In his major works, Motivation and Personality (1954) and Toward a Psychology of Being (1962), Maslow argued that each person has a hierarchy of needs that must be satisfied, ranging from basic physiological requirements to love, esteem, and, finally, self-actualization. As each need is satisfied, the next higher level in the emotional hierarchy dominates conscious functioning. Maslow believed that truly healthy people were self-actualizers because they satisfied the highest psychological needs, fully integrating the components of their personality, or self. His papers, published posthumously, were issued in 1971 as The Farther Reaches of Human Nature.
