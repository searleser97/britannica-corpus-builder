Neuropsychology,  science concerned with the integration of psychological observations on behaviour with neurological observations on the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain. The field emerged through the work of Paul Broca and Carl Wernicke (1848â€“1905), both of whom identified sites on the cerebral cortex involved in the production or comprehension of language. Great strides have since been made in describing neuroanatomical systems and their relation to higher mental processes. The related field of neuropsychiatry addresses itself to disorders such as aphasia, Korsakoff syndrome, Tourette syndrome, and other CNS abnormalities. See also laterality.
