Ludwig Klages,  (born Dec. 10, 1872, Hannover, Ger.—died  July 29, 1956, Kilchberg, near Zürich, Switz.), German psychologist and philosopher, distinguished in the field of characterology. He was also a founder of modern graphology (handwriting analysis).
Educated in chemistry, physics, and philosophy at the University of Munich, where he also taught, Klages was a leader in the German vitalist movement (1895–1915), which argued that laws of physics and chemistry alone cannot explain life. In 1905 he founded at Monaco a centre for characterological study, which he moved to Kilchberg, Switz., in 1919.
Klages believed human beings to be distinguishable from other animals by a “spirit” (Geist) that underlies the human capacity to think and to will. This capacity is the source of human estrangement from the world and is the origin of the ego and its desire for immortality. His research sought to define and structure characteristics evidenced in different egos, as documented in Prinzipien der Charakterologie (1910; “Principles of Characterology”), Geist und Leben (1935; “Spirit and Life”), and Die Sprache als Quell der Seelenkunde (1948; “Language as the Source of Knowledge of the Soul”).
