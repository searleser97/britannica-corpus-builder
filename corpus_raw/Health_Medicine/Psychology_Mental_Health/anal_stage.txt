Anal stage,  in Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the period in a child’s psychosexual development during which the child’s main concerns are with the processes of elimination. The anal stage, generally the second and third years of life, is held to be significant for the child’s later development because the acquisition of bowel control is presumed to be connected to other forms of self-control, such as cleanliness and orderliness.
