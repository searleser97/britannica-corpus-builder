F. W. H. Myers,  (born February 6, 1843, Keswick, Cumberland, England—died January 17, 1901, Rome, Italy), English poet, critic, and essayist whose later life was increasingly devoted to the work of the Psychical Research Society, which he helped to found in 1882.
Myers was a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and served as a classical lecturer there from 1865; he gave up teaching in 1872 to become a school inspector. St. Paul (1867) is his best-known poem, though more mature work is to be found in The Renewal of Youth (1882). He was an authority on William Wordsworth’s poetry, and his collection Essays, Classical and Modern, 2 vol. (1883), also contains a fine critical study of the Latin poet Virgil. Myers’ works devoted to psychical studies include Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death (1903), Phantasms of the Living (1886), and Science and a Future Life (1893).
