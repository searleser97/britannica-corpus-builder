E. Mavis Hetherington, in full Eileen Mavis Hetherington, original name Eileen Mavis Plenderleith,  (born November 27, 1926, British Columbia, Canada), Canadian-born developmental psychologist best known for her work on the effects of divorce and remarriage on child development. She also made significant contributions to research on childhood psychopathology, personality and social development, and stress and coping.
She received a bachelor’s degree in English and psychology (1947) and a master’s degree in psychology (1948) from the University of British Columbia. She later studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned a Ph.D. in psychology in 1958. Having married John Hetherington, a lawyer and legal scholar, she subsequently taught at Rutgers University (1958–60), the University of Wisconsin (1960–70), and the University of Virginia at Charlottesville (1970–99), where she was the James M. Page Professor of Psychology from 1976. She retired as professor emeritus in 1999.
Hetherington began her research career by studying sex-role stereotyping in families and documenting the influence of fathers on their children. The latter work in turn led her to investigate the effects of absent fathers. In 1972 she and her colleagues undertook the 20-year Virginia Longitudinal Study of Divorce, which eventually concluded that divorce, though certainly harmful to children, is not as devastating to them as most psychological theorists had assumed. That research and other long-term studies were discussed in her 2002 book For Better or Worse: Divorce Reconsidered (coauthored with John Kelly), which argued that children in divorced families and stepfamilies can continue to function within normal ranges.
Hetherington was the recipient of numerous honours and awards for both teaching and scholarship, including the American Psychological Association’s Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions (2004).
