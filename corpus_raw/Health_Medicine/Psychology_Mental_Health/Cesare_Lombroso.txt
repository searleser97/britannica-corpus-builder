Cesare Lombroso,  (born Nov. 6, 1835, Verona, Austrian Empire [now in Italy]—died  Oct. 19, 1909, Turin, Italy), Italian criminologist whose views, though now largely discredited, brought about a shift in criminology from a legalistic preoccupation with crime to a scientific study of criminals.
Lombroso studied at the universities of Padua, Vienna, and Paris, and from 1862 to 1876 he was professor of psychiatry at the University of Pavia. In 1871 he became director of the mental asylum at Pesaro, and in 1876 he became professor of forensic medicine and hygiene at the University of Turin, where he subsequently held appointments as professor of psychiatry (1896) and then of criminal anthropology (1906).
Lombroso tried to discern a possible relationship between criminal psychopathology and physical or constitutional defects. His chief contention was the existence of a hereditary, or atavistic, class of criminals who are in effect biological throwbacks to a more primitive stage of human evolution. Lombroso contended that such criminals exhibit a higher percentage of physical and mental anomalies than do noncriminals. Among these anomalies, which he termed stigmata, were various unusual skull sizes and asymmetries of the facial bones. Lombroso’s theories were widely influential in Europe for a time, but his emphasis on hereditary causes of crime was later strongly rejected in favour of environmental factors. Lombroso tried to reform the Italian penal system, and he encouraged more humane and constructive treatment of convicts through the use of work programs intended to make them more productive members of society. Among his books are L’uomo delinquente (1876; “The Criminal Man”) and Le Crime, causes et remèdes (1899; Crime, Its Causes and Remedies).
