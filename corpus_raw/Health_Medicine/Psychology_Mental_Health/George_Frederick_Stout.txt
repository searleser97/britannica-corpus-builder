George Frederick Stout,  (born Jan. 6, 1860, South Shields, Durham, Eng.—died  Aug. 18, 1944, Sydney, Australia), English psychologist and philosopher who advanced a system of psychology emphasizing mental acts.
While a student at the University of Cambridge, Stout studied principally with the psychologist James Ward and, like him, came to approach psychology philosophically. He developed a concept, akin to Aristotle’s, of the soul as the form of the body and joined Ward in opposing the prevalent theory of associationism.
A fellow of St. John’s College, Cambridge (1884–96), Stout published his first and perhaps most original work, Analytic Psychology, 2 vol., in 1896. Its view of the role of activity in intellectual processes was later verified experimentally by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Stout also lectured on comparative psychology at the University of Aberdeen before becoming reader in mental philosophy at the University of Oxford (1898–1902). His Manual of Psychology (1899) formulated many principles later developed experimentally by the Gestalt school of psychology, which takes a comprehensive approach to examining mental life, the whole of which is regarded as greater than the sum of the parts. Stout was professor of logic and metaphysics at St. Andrews University, Fife, from 1903 to 1936. He published another major work, Mind and Matter (1931).
