Eric Kandel,  (born November 7, 1929, Vienna, Austria), Austrian-born American neurobiologist who, with Arvid Carlsson and Paul Greengard, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2000 for discovering the central role synapses play in memory and learning.
Kandel received a medical degree from New York University’s School of Medicine in 1956. Following residency in psychiatry and employment at Harvard University, he served as associate professor at New York University (1965–74). Beginning in 1974, Kandel held a series of professorships at Columbia University, where he also directed its Center for Neurobiology and Behavior until 1983. In 1984 he became an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
Kandel’s award-winning research centred on the sea slug Apylsia, which has relatively few nerve cells, many of them very large and easy to study. The sea slug also has a protective reflex to guard its gills, which Kandel used to study the basic learning mechanisms. These experiments, combined with his later research on mice, established that memory is centred on the synapses, as changes in synaptic function form different types of memory. Kandel showed that weak stimuli give rise to certain chemical changes in synapses; these changes are the basis for short-term memory, which lasts minutes to hours. Stronger stimuli cause different synaptic changes, which result in a form of long-term memory that can remain for weeks.
Kandel’s books included The Age of Insight: The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain: From Vienna 1900 to the Present (2012) and The Disordered Mind: What Unusual Brains Tell Us About Ourselves (2018). In Search of Memory: The Emergence of a New Science of Mind (2006) was an autobiography.
