James Ward,  (born Jan. 27, 1843, Hull, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  March 4, 1925, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), philosopher and psychologist who exerted a major influence on the development of psychology in Great Britain.
After completing his theological studies at Spring Hill College, later Mansfield College, Oxford (1869), he obtained a one-year scholarship at the University of Göttingen and began studying under Rudolf Hermann Lotze, champion of the emerging science of physiological psychology.
Returning to England, Ward proved unpopular as a Congregational preacher because of his unconventional views. He resigned to continue studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow (1875–1925). He established a laboratory for research in physiological psychology in 1891.
Ward’s outlook was also influenced by the German philosopher-psychologist Franz Brentano and by the theory of evolution. Like Brentano, he conceived of the mind as a principle that is active in perceiving and judging. Further, he regarded mental processes as evolving toward a state of increasing differentiation. Ward was opposed to associationism, a theory prevalent at that time, and together with G.F. Stout introduced a functionalistic approach that was later developed in the United States by William James. He advanced his system in a celebrated article, “Psychology” (1886), in the 9th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica, and he revised and further refined it for the 11th edition (1911). He completed the elaboration of his system in Psychological Principles (1918).
