Alfred Binet,  (born July 8, 1857, Nice, France—died October 18, 1911, Paris), French psychologist who played a dominant role in the development of experimental psychology in France and who made fundamental contributions to the measurement of intelligence.
Fascinated by the work of the neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot on hypnosis at the Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, Binet abandoned a law career in 1878 to devote himself to medico-scientific studies at the hospital, at which he remained until 1891. He then became associated with a research laboratory at the Sorbonne (1891) and served as its director from 1895 to 1911. Seeing little value in German laboratory research on sensation and perception, he sought to develop experimental methods to measure reasoning ability and other higher mental processes, devising techniques using paper, pencil, pictures, and portable objects. In 1895 he founded L’Année psychologique, the first French journal devoted to psychology. About the same time, he opened a Paris laboratory for child study and experimental teaching.
Impressed by the attempt of the English psychologist Sir Francis Galton to record individual differences by means of standardized tests, Binet adapted the method to studies of eminent writers, artists, mathematicians, and chess players, often supplementing the more formal tests with observations on body type, handwriting, and other characteristics. L’Étude expérimentale de l’intelligence (1903; “Experimental Study of Intelligence”) is an investigation of the mental characteristics of his two daughters, which he developed into a systematic study of two contrasted types of personalities. Between 1905 and 1911 he and Théodore Simon developed highly influential scales for the measurement of intelligence of children. Binet also published works on suggestibility (1900) and hysteria (1910) and was working on a revision of his scales at the time of his death.
