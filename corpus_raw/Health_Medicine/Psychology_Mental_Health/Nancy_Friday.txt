Nancy Friday,  (born August 27, 1933, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died November 5, 2017, New York, New York), American feminist and author who was especially known for works that explored women’s sexuality.
Friday was educated at Wellesley (Massachusetts) College. She worked briefly as a reporter for the San Juan Island Times and as a magazine editor before turning to full-time writing in 1963. She produced several books of popular psychology, beginning in 1973 with the publication of My Secret Garden: Women’s Sexual Fantasies, which was based on hundreds of letters and interviews. Although some dismissed the book as pornographic, it was a best seller and encouraged the discussion of female sexuality. Other erotic books followed, including Forbidden Flowers (1975) and Women on Top (1991). Friday addressed men’s sexual fantasies in Men in Love (1980).
Critics had a more favourable review of My Mother/My Self: The Daughter’s Search for Identity (1977), in which Friday argued that women of her generation had been reared by their mothers to conform to a prefeminist ideal of womanhood from which they would have to struggle to liberate themselves. Her later works included Jealousy (1985) and the novella Lulu (2012).
