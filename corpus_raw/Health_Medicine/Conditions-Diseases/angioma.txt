Angioma,  congenital mass of blood vessels that intrudes into bone or other tissues, causing tissue death and, in the case of bone, structural weakening. Angiomas of the bone are often associated with angiomas of the skin or muscles. Most angiomas remain asymptomatic, but they may cause collapse of the vertebrae if they occur in the spine, and hemorrhage is a danger in some locations that expose them to stress. Treatment is usually by radiation, which causes clot formation within the mass of vascular tissue; the clot will then gradually calcify. Surgery also may be performed but involves a risk of hemorrhage.
