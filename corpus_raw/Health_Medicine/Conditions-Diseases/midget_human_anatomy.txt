Midget,  in human anatomy, a person of very small stature whose bodily proportions, intelligence, and sexual development are within the normal range. Diminutive stature occurs sporadically in families the rest of whose members are of ordinary size. The children of midgets are usually of ordinary height and proportions. This term is often considered pejorative; the term proportionate dwarf is now preferred. See dwarfism; Pygmy.
