Inoculation,   process of producing immunity and method of vaccination that consists of introduction of the infectious agent onto an abraded or absorptive skin surface instead of inserting the substance in the tissues by means of a hollow needle, as in injection. Of the common vaccines, only smallpox vaccine is routinely inoculated. The term inoculation is also commonly used more broadly to mean any introduction of antigenic substances into the tissues. See also immunization; vaccine.
