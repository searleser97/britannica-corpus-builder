Viroid,   an infectious particle smaller than any of the known viruses, an agent of certain plant diseases. The particle consists only of an extremely small circular RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecule, lacking the protein coat of a virus. Viroids appear to be transmitted mechanically from one cell to another through cellular debris. Viroids are of much interest because of their subviral nature and their obscure mode of action. Potato spindle tuber disease is viroid-induced. Whether viroids occur in animal cells is still uncertain.
