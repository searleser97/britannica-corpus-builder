Actinomycosis,  chronic bacterial infection of humans and cattle that is caused by anaerobic or microaerophilic (oxygen-requiring) species of the genus Actinomyces. The disease is characterized by the development of multiple abscesses (painful, hard, pus-filled swellings) and draining sinus tracts (channels that extend from the site of infection to an opening at the skin surface), which exude sulfur granules (yellow pus-containing material). Actinomycosis is an exceedingly rare disease in humans that typically strikes between ages 20 and 50.
Actinomyces bacteria are members of the normal flora of animals (including humans), occurring in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and the human female genital tract. Under certain conditions (i.e., when mucous membrane integrity becomes compromised, facilitating direct invasion of devitalized tissues), some species become pathogenic (disease-causing). The most common pathogenic species are Actinomyces bovis in cattle and A. israeli and A. gerencseriae in humans.
The most prevalent form is cervicofacial actinomycosis (“lumpy jaw” in cattle), which affects primarily the jaws, neck, and face and in humans accounts for at least half of all cases. Cervicofacial lesions may appear following a wound in the mouth or a tooth extraction. Less common forms of the disease include thoracic, affecting primarily the lungs and surrounding structures, and abdominal and pelvic actinomycosis. Thoracic actinomycosis may result from inhalation of the organism into the air passages and is usually associated with weight loss, night sweats, coughing, and high fever. Lesions of the abdomen and pelvis may follow surgery for appendicitis or perforation of the stomach or large intestine.
In rare cases actinomycosis may be disseminated via the bloodstream, in which case lesions appear in most parts of the body. Treatment is with antibiotics; surgical drainage or excision of accessible lesions are valuable adjuncts.
