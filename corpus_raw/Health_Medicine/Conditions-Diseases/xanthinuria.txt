Xanthinuria,   rare inherited disorder of purine metabolism that results from a deficiency in the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Normally this enzyme breaks down the purine base xanthine to uric acid, which is then excreted. In the absence of the enzyme, xanthine is not metabolized by the body and its concentration builds up in the blood and urine. Xanthinuria is not a serious condition, and many individuals are symptomless. Some patients, however, develop xanthine stones in their kidneys. Treatment in these instances includes an increase in fluid intake and a reduction in consumption of foods rich in purines, such as organ meats, asparagus, and mushrooms.
