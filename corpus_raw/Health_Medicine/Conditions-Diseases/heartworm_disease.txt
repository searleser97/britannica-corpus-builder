Heartworm disease,  parasitic disease, predominantly of dogs but also occurring in cats, that is caused by the nematode Dirofilaria immitis. Infective larvae (microfilariae) develop in mosquitoes, which serve as the vector for transmission. In dogs, after the larvae are introduced into the host, they develop and migrate to the right side of the heart, where they mature. Adult worms attain lengths of 17–27 cm (7–11 inches), and they can survive for three to five years in the heart. As the number of heartworms in the dog’s heart increases, blood flow is compromised, and the infected animal shows respiratory distress upon exercise. A dog may tolerate as many as 100 worms with minimal health problems unless stressed. Diagnosis is aided by X-ray imaging of the heart and lungs, an antigen test, and examination of a blood sample for microfilariae produced by adult females. Treatment of heartworm disease can be hazardous because fragments of dead worms can block critical lung vessels. Prevention has been greatly enhanced in recent years by the discovery of drugs that prevent development of infective larvae.
Cats can also be infected by Dirofilaria larvae. They do not tolerate a large worm load, and a single worm can be life-threatening.
