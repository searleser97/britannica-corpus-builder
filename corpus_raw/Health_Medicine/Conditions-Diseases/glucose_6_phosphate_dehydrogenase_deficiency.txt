Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,   hereditary metabolic defect characterized by an increased tendency of the red blood cells to break and release their hemoglobin (hemolysis), especially after the intake of certain drugs. The condition is caused, as the name indicates, by the markedly reduced activity in the red blood cells of a particular organic catalyst, or enzyme, called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This low enzyme activity is associated with a decrease in the formation of certain substances that normally help to prevent the oxidative destruction of the red blood cell membrane. Under normal conditions, the affected red blood cells are only slightly more fragile than usual, but more than 40 drugs, including chloramphenicol and sulfonamides, all of which are converted in the body to oxidant compounds, have been shown to produce hemolysis in susceptible persons. There seem to be several variants of the disorder, all of which appear to be sex-linked and fully expressed in males only. The most common form is found chiefly in persons whose ancestors inhabited either Africa or the Eastern Mediterranean basin. A possible protective effect of this metabolic abnormality against malaria has been suggested.
