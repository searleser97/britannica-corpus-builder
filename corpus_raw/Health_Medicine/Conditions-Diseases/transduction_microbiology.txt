Transduction,   a process of genetic recombination in bacteria in which genes from a host cell (a bacterium) are incorporated into the genome of a bacterial virus (bacteriophage) and then carried to another host cell when the bacteriophage initiates another cycle of infection. In general transduction, any of the genes of the host cell may be involved in the process; in special transduction, however, only a few specific genes are transduced. It has been exploited as a remarkable molecular biological technique for altering the genetic construction of bacteria, for locating bacterial genes, and for many other genetic experiments.
