Leukoplakia,  precancerous tumour of the mucous membranes, usually seen in the mouth or on the tongue or cheeks, but also known to occur on the lips, as well as on the vagina, vulva, or anus. Leukoplakia first appears as a small, smooth, white spot (that cannot be scraped off) but develops into a larger area of thickening with a rough texture and colour varying from white to gray; red areas within the leukoplakia pose a particularly high risk of becoming malignant. Older lesions may have numerous fissures and sores and tend to bleed after slight injury. Oral leukoplakia tends to be more common in men than women, affecting some 8 percent of men over age 70, versus just 2 percent of women the same age.
Tertiary syphilis was a common cause of leukoplakia in the past. Most cases now result from external irritants, notably tobacco smoke. Other factors believed to contribute to this disease include exposure to sunlight, poor dental hygiene, and ill-fitting dentures. Leukoplakia may persist for many years without becoming malignant, but the high risk of squamous-cell carcinoma dictates complete removal of the tumour by surgery or freezing, as well as the elimination of all predisposing factors.
Hairy leukoplakia is a white lesion that typically forms on the side of the tongue and has a fuzzy, corrugated appearance. It often occurs in persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or the AIDS-related complex (ARC). The Epstein-Barr virus has been isolated from the lesions.
