Pineal tumour,  mass of abnormal tissue arising in the pineal gland and occurring most often in children and young adults. Pineal tumours are rare. The most frequently occurring of these are germ cell tumours (germinomas and teratomas), which arise from embryonic remnants of germ cells (precursors of egg and sperm cells). Germ cell tumours are malignant and invasive and may be life-threatening. Tumours of the pinealocytes (the primary cell type of the pineal gland) also occur and vary in their potential for malignant change.
Pineal tumours may cause headache, vomiting, and seizures because of the increase in intracranial pressure that results from the enlarging tumour mass. Some patients may become hypogonadal with regression of secondary sex characteristics, whereas others may undergo precocious puberty because of secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (a placental hormone that stimulates ovarian theca cells and testicular Leydig cells to secrete sex steroids). Diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by excessive thirst and excessive production of very dilute urine, is frequently present and is usually due to tumour invasion of the hypothalamus. Invasion of the pituitary stalk may interfere with the inhibition of prolactin secretion by dopamine from the hypothalamus, resulting in high serum prolactin concentrations. Treatment consists of surgery and radiation therapy.
