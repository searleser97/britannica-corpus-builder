Epithelioma,  an abnormal growth, or tumour, of the epithelium, the layer of tissue (such as the skin or mucous membrane) that covers the surfaces of organs and other structures of the body. Epitheliomas can be benign or malignant (that is, cancerous), and there are various types depending on the kinds of epithelial cells affected. Common epitheliomas include basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (cancerous epitheliomas are known as carcinomas), two types of skin cancer that involve the inner layers and scalelike outer cells of the skin, respectively; and parathyroid adenoma, a benign tumour of glandular tissue in the parathyroid gland that can cause a condition known as hyperparathyroidism.
