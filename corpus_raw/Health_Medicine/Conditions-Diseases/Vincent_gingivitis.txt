Vincent gingivitis, also called Vincent infection, Vincent stomatitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, Vincent angina, or trench mouth,  acute and painful infection of the tooth margins and gums that is caused by the symbiotic microorganisms Bacillus fusiformis and Borrelia vincentii. The chief symptoms are painful, swollen, bleeding gums; small, painful ulcers covering the gums and tooth margins; and characteristic fetid breath. The ulcers may spread to the throat and tonsils. Fever and malaise may also be present. Vincent gingivitis can occur after a prolonged failure to brush oneâ€™s teeth, though there are many other predisposing factors, such as vitamin deficiencies, emotional stress, and so on. The infection is readily treated by bed rest, the administration of penicillin or other antibiotics, and the use of antiseptic mouth rinses. Regular tooth brushing is the chief preventive measure.
