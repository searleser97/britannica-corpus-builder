Lysogeny,  type of life cycle that takes place when a bacteriophage infects certain types of bacteria. In this process, the genome (the collection of genes in the nucleic acid core of a virus) of the bacteriophage stably integrates into the chromosome of the host bacterium and replicates in concert with it. No progeny viruses are produced. Instead, the infecting virus lies dormant within the bacterium’s chromosome until the bacterium is exposed to certain stimuli, such as ultraviolet light. Following this induction event, the virus enters a life cycle in which its genome is excised from the host chromosome and begins to multiply, forming new progeny viruses. Ultimately the bacterial host is destroyed (lysed) and the virus particles are released into the environment and infect new bacterial cells. This process was first explained by the French biologist André Lwoff in the early 1950s.
