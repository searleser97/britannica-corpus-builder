Patricia Roberts Harris, née Patricia Roberts,  (born May 31, 1924, Mattoon, Ill., U.S.—died March 23, 1985, Washington, D.C.), American public official, the first African American woman named to a U.S. ambassadorship and the first as well to serve in a presidential cabinet.
Harris grew up in Mattoon and in Chicago. She graduated from Howard University, Washington, D.C., in 1945, pursued graduate studies for two years at the University of Chicago, and from 1946 to 1949 was a program director for the Young Women’s Christian Association in Chicago. In 1949 she returned to Washington, D.C., where she did further graduate work at American University and worked as assistant director of the American Council on Human Rights (1949–53). For six years thereafter she was executive director of the national headquarters of Delta Sigma Theta sorority. In 1960 she graduated from the law school at George Washington University and was admitted to the District of Columbia bar. After a year in the criminal division of the U.S. Department of Justice, she became associate dean of students and lecturer in law at Howard University. During 1962–65 she worked with the National Capital Area Civil Liberties Union. Although she relinquished her administrative post at Howard in 1963, she remained on the Howard faculty.
In 1963 Harris was named cochair, with Mildred McAfee Horton, of the National Women’s Committee for Civil Rights. Serving as U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg from 1965 to 1967, she was the first African American woman to hold ambassadorial rank. She rejoined the Howard law faculty from 1967 to 1969. From January 1977 to August 1979, she was secretary of housing and urban development, and she thereafter was secretary of health, education and welfare (later health and human services). She was the first African American woman to be a member of a presidential cabinet.
In 1981 she returned to George Washington University as a full-time professor of law, and in 1982 she made an unsuccessful bid for mayor of Washington, D.C.
