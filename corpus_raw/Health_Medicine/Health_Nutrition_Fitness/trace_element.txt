Trace element, also called micronutrient,  in biology, any chemical element required by living organisms in minute amounts (that is less than 0.1 percent by volume [1,000 parts per million]), usually as part of a vital enzyme (a cell-produced catalytic protein).
Exact needs vary among species, but commonly required plant trace elements include copper, boron, zinc, manganese, and molybdenum. Animals also require manganese, iodine, and cobalt. Lack of a necessary plant trace element in the soil causes deficiency diseases; lack of animal trace elements in the soil may not harm plants, but, without them, animals feeding solely on those plants develop their own deficiency diseases.
The term trace element also appears in geology, where it is used to describe elements other than oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium that occur in minuscule concentrations in rocksâ€”that is, in concentrations of less than 0.1 percent by weight. Trace element concentrations are typically expressed in parts per million.
