Dietary fibre,  Food material not digestible by the human small intestine and only partially digestible by the large intestine. Fibre is beneficial in the diet because it relieves and prevents constipation, appears to reduce the risk of colon cancer, and reduces plasma cholesterol levels and therefore the risk of heart disease. Fibre also slows gastric emptying and contributes to satiety. Whole grains, vegetables, nuts, and fruits are all good sources. See also nutrition.
