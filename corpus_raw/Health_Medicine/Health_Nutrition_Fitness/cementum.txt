Cementum, also called Cement,  in anatomy, thin layer of bonelike material covering the roots and sometimes other parts of the teeth of mammals. Cementum is yellowish and softer than either dentine or enamel. It is made by a layer of cementum-producing cells (cementoblasts) adjacent to the dentine. The fibres of the periodontal membrane, which holds the tooth in its socket, are embedded in the cementum. Deposition of cementum continues throughout the life of the animal, especially in response to stresses. In humans, for example, as the tooth crown wears down, new cementum is deposited on the roots so that the tooth gradually rises higher in the socket and good occlusion (bite) is maintained.
