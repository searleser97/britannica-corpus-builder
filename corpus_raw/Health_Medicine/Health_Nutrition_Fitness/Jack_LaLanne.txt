Jack LaLanne, in full Jack François Henri LaLanne,  (born September 26, 1914, San Francisco, California, U.S.—died January 23, 2011, Morro Bay, California), American exercise and nutrition guru, television personality, and motivational speaker.
During his childhood, LaLanne suffered from poor health and erratic behaviour, which he would come to believe was caused by a sugar addiction. As a teen, he attended a lecture by nutritionist Paul Bragg, after which LaLanne cut sugar from his diet and embarked on an exercise routine. These lifestyle changes would come to define his decades-long quest to promote healthy living in America. In 1936 he opened the first public health club (later a chain) in the United States, located in Oakland, California. Among his other innovations, LaLanne originated the leg-extension machine, now a fitness standard.
In 1951, with the debut of The Jack LaLanne Show, LaLanne became the first host of a televised exercise program. When the show went into syndication in the late 1950s, LaLanne became the face of fitness for viewers across the United States. The program ran for decades, its popularity aided by the feats of showmanship that LaLanne used to advertise the benefits of peak physical condition. These included two handcuffed swims from Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco to Alcatraz Island—the second time at age 60 and towing a boat behind him—and a record-setting bout of more than 1,000 push-ups in 23 minutes. After his show completed its run in 1985, LaLanne continued to appear as a motivational speaker and on television, most notably in infomercials touting various products, including his own juicer.
