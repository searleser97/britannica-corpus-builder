Aerobics,  system of physical conditioning that increases the efficiency of the body’s intake of oxygen, thereby stimulating the cardiovascular system, developing endurance, and reducing body fat. Increased energy, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, greater suppleness, stronger bones, better posture, and decreased stress levels are other benefits that may accrue from aerobic activity. To be effective, aerobic training must include a minimum of three sessions per week. During each session, usually lasting an hour, the exerciser’s heart rate must be raised to a training level for at least 20 minutes. (See also exercise.)
The concept of aerobics was pioneered in the United States by physician Kenneth H. Cooper and popularized in his books Aerobics (1968) and The Aerobics Way (1977). Cooper’s system uses point charts to rate the aerobic value of various exercises for different age-groups. As individuals progressively upgrade the quantity and quality of their exercise, they can gauge the improvement in their physical condition through the point system. In the 1980s aerobics was popularized by Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons through workout videotapes and instructional programs. Sometimes called group fitness, aerobics is most often practiced in health and fitness clubs where groups of one to two dozen exercisers follow the lead of an instructor whose movements are synchronized to up-tempo popular music.
