Sucking,   drawing of fluids into the mouth by creating a vacuum pressure in the oral cavity. Mammalian infants rely on this method of food ingestion until they are capable of eating more solid substances. A partial vacuum is created in the oral cavity by retracting the tongue to the back of the mouth. The rear portion of the tongue seals against the roof of the mouth, allowing liquids to be drawn into the front region. When the oral cavity is full, the tongue relaxes, and fluids flow back to the throat to be swallowed.
