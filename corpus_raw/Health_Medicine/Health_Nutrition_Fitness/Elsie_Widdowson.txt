Elsie Widdowson, in full Elsie May Widdowson,  (born Oct. 21, 1906, London, Eng.—died June 14, 2000, Cambridge, Eng.), English nutritionist who, in collaboration with her longtime research partner, Robert A. McCance, guided the British government’s World War II food-rationing program.
Widdowson received bachelor’s (1928) and doctoral (1931) degrees in chemistry from Imperial College, London. Following completion of her doctorate, she spent a year at the Courtauld Institute of Biochemistry at Middlesex Hospital before moving to King’s College of Household and Social Science in 1933. It was there, while studying dietetics, that she met McCance. She accompanied him to Cambridge when he accepted a position there in 1938.
Widdowson and McCance documented the nutritional content of thousands of foods, eventually compiling their findings in the The Chemical Composition of Foods (1940), which became a classic in the field of nutrition and was revised several times. Spurred by the British government’s concerns about the effects of the heavy rationing necessitated by the outbreak of World War II, the pair did extensive research into the effects of dietary deprivation, eventually determining that a basic diet of bread, potatoes, and cabbage was sufficient. Later research led them to advocate the fortification of food (notably bread) with iron, vitamins, and calcium.
Widdowson remained a member of the research staff at the University of Cambridge until 1972. She served as president of the Nutrition Society (1977–80), the Neonatal Society (1978–81), and the British Nutrition Foundation (1986–96) and was elected to the Royal Society (1976). Widdowson was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 1979 and a Companion of Honour in 1993. In 1999 the Elsie Widdowson Laboratory for human nutrition research was dedicated at Cambridge.
