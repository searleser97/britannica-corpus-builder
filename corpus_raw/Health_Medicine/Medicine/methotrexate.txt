Methotrexate,  drug used to slow the growth of certain cancers, including leukemia, breast cancer, and lung cancer. It is also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, a skin disease in which abnormally rapid proliferation of epidermal cells occurs. Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the B vitamin folic acid (folate). It prevents the synthesis of nucleic acids and thus inhibits cell reproduction. This property also makes it effective as an agent of medical abortion, either for the termination of ectopic pregnancy or of normal intrauterine pregnancy during the first seven to nine weeks.
