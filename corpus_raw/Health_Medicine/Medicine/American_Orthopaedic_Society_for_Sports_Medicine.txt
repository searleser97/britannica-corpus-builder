American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM),  U.S. medical organization established in 1972 and headquartered in Rosemont, Illinois. It had its origins in the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and its Committee on Sports Medicine, whose members saw a need for a forum in which orthopedic surgeons interested in sports medicine could hold meetings, exchange scientific information, and publish research and new ideas in the field. The AOSSM held its first annual meeting in 1973. Its membership consists of physicians and allied health professional who are active sports medicine practitioners, such as team physicians and presenters of scientific research at relevant meetings. The organization also works with health professionals such as physical therapists and trainers involved in the care and rehabilitation of patients with sports injuries.
In addition to its annual meeting and its publications, the AOSSM engages in a number of related activities. It develops materials for patient education as well as clinical practice materials for orthopedists and other practitioners in sports medicine. Those materials cover such topics as concussion management, anterior cruciate ligament injuries, and the role and responsibilities of team physicians.
The AOSSM provides continuing-education courses to its members as well and maintains an active research program. It provides financial support  in the form of awards and grants, including the Young Investigators Grant program and awards for outstanding original research. The societyâ€™s outreach activities include its Traveling Fellowship Program, an annual international exchange with European and Pacific Rim countries that allows selected fellows to travel internationally to lecture on and observe orthopedic sports medicine care. The AOSSM also maintains partnerships with a variety of medical and sports-related organizations.
