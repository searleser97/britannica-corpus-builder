Codeine, also called methylmorphine,  naturally occurring alkaloid of opium, the dried milky exudate of the unripe seed capsule of the poppy Papaver somniferum, that is used in medicine as a cough suppressant and analgesic drug. Codeine exerts its effects by acting on the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). First isolated by French chemist Pierre-Jean Robiquet in 1832, codeine may be extracted directly from opium, but most codeine is produced from morphine, another opium derivative. Because of its narcotic effects, the distribution of the drug is controlled by various governmental agencies.
