Cephalin-cholesterol flocculation,  laboratory test for the nonspecific measurement of blood globulins, a group of proteins that appear in abnormally high concentrations (hyperglobulinemia) in association with certain diseases. The test consists of adding blood serum to a suitably prepared emulsion of cephalin-cholesterol. A flocculent precipitate will form if the serum is abnormally high in globulins. The test is helpful in confirming the presence of liver disease, subacute bacterial endocarditis, rheumatoid arthritis, and malaria.
