Cascara sagrada,  (Spanish: “sacred bark”), the dried bark of the buckthorn Rhamnus purshiana (order Rosales) used in medicine as a laxative. The tree is cultivated in North America and Kenya. Cascara sagrada is prepared in both liquid and solid forms. The activity apparently results from the combined action of several substances, a number of which have been isolated; they consist chiefly of anthraquinones.
