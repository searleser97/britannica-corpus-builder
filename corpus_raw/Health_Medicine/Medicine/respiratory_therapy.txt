Respiratory therapy, also called respiratory care,  medical profession primarily concerned with assisting respiratory function of individuals with severe acute or chronic lung disease.
One of the conditions frequently dealt with is obstruction of breathing passages, in which chest physiotherapy is used to facilitate clearing the airway of mucus or liquid secretion by suction. Chest percussion, performed manually or by means of a handheld percussor or vest, produces vibrations that help to loosen and mobilize secretions. Postural drainage is a technique in which the forces of gravity are used to promote the drainage of obstructing secretions.
Aerosol treatments are used to relieve bronchospasm and mucous membrane swelling and to mobilize secretions for easy removal. Water is a major therapeutic agent in bronchopulmonary disease and may be used in the form of cold steam, hot steam, or a fog (as in an oxygen tent or a croup tent). Aerosol humidifiers called nebulizers may be powered by compressor machinery or by a hand-squeezed bulb to project medication or water spray into the airway. Ultrasonic equipment may be used to propel very fine particles directly into the lungs, as in treatment of cystic fibrosis. Medications, such as bronchodilators, mucolytics, and antibiotics, can also be administered in an inhaled mist by means of an ultrasonic nebulizer.
Therapy may involve the administration of gases for inhalation. Oxygen may be administered in controlled amounts to assist laboured breathing. A mixture of helium and oxygen is used to treat some diseases of airway obstruction.
In addition, respiratory therapists are experts in the setup, adjustment, and maintenance of mechanical ventilators.
