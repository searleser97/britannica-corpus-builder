Medical association,   professional organization or learned society developed to promote high standards in medical education and practice, science, and ethics. The medical association also works to promote and protect the interests of its physician members. The largest such organization is the World Medical Association, which has more than 60 member associations. It was founded in 1947.
A prime example of a medical association is the influential American Medical Association (q.v.; AMA), founded in 1847. Its major publication is the Journal of the American Medical Association. With the rise of speciality boards and associations, however, the AMA lost its place as the exclusive forum for American medicine, and other highly respected publications—such as The New England Journal of Medicine—gained prominence. Other examples include the three major medical associations in Great Britain: the Royal College of Physicians of London, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and the British Medical Association (BMA). The latter association, formed in 1832, initially represented rural physicians and specifically excluded London doctors or those associated with the Royal Societies. Now it chiefly represents general practitioners and has had great influence in shaping the provisions of the National Health Service.
