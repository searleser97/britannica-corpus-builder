Ampicillin,  drug used in the treatment of various infections, including otitis media (middle ear infection), sinusitis, and acute bacterial cystitis. Ampicillin (or alpha-aminobenzylpenicillin) is a semisynthetic penicillin, one of the first such antibiotics developed. Similar in action to penicillin G but more effective against gram-negative bacteria, ampicillin is more stable in stomach acids and therefore may be given orally.
The potential side effects of ampicillin are similar to those of other penicillinsâ€”i.e., chiefly allergic reactions ranging from skin rashes and hives to life-threatening anaphylactic shock (very rare). People who are allergic to other drugs in this family are also likely to react to ampicillin. The incidence of skin rash is higher with ampicillin than with other penicillins, a factor that suggests a possible toxic reaction as well as a truly allergic response.
