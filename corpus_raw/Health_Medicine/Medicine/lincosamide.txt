Lincosamide,  any agent in a class of antibiotics that are derived from the compound lincomycin and that inhibit the growth of bacteria by blocking bacterial protein synthesis. Lincomycin, the first lincosamide, was isolated in 1962 from a soil bacterium (Streptomyces lincolnensis). Clindamycin is a derivative of lincomycin that has better microbial activity and rate of gastrointestinal absorption. As a result, lincomycin has limited use. Clindamycin is active against Staphylococcus, some Streptococcus, and anaerobic bacteria. Because it has been associated with pseudomembranous colitis (inflammation of the small intestine and the colon), it is used with caution.
