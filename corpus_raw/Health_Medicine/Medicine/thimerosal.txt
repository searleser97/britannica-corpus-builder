Thimerosal, also called thiomersal,  mercury-containing organic compound with antimicrobial and preservative properties. Thimerosal was developed in the 1920s and became widely used as a preservative in antiseptic ointments, eye drops, and nasal sprays as well as in vaccines, particularly those that were stored in multidose vials. While its use as a vaccine preservative declined with the development of newer vaccines that were made available in single-dose vials, it continued to be used in some antivenins and eye and nasal products as well as in certain vaccines, including vaccines against diphtheria and tetanus and vaccines that still required storage in multidose containers.
Thimerosal has been marketed under the trade name Merthiolate. It is related to merbromin (Mercurochrome) and nitromersol (Metaphen). The presence of mercury, which by weight constitutes about 50 percent of the thimerosal compound, is responsible for the disinfecting action, which precipitates the protein of a microorganism and disrupts its metabolism. Thimerosal occurs as a light-coloured crystalline powder, soluble in water and in alcohol. It is used as a 0.1 percent alcoholic tincture or aqueous solution.
