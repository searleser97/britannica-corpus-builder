Sore throat,  painful inflammation of the passage from the mouth to the pharynx or of the pharynx itself. A sore throat may be a symptom of influenza or of other respiratory infections, a result of irritation by foreign objects or fumes, or a reaction to certain drugs. Infections caused by a strain of streptococcal bacteria and viruses are often the primary cause of a sore throat. Generally, the throat reddens, and the tonsils may secrete pus and become swollen. Microbial agents producing soreness may remain localized or may spread (by way of lymph channels or the bloodstream) and produce such serious complications as rheumatic fever. In treating nonviral sore throat, antibiotics are often effective; antiseptic gargles may also be helpful. For a viral sore throat, no antibiotics are necessary; symptoms should subside after one week. See also pharyngitis.
