Charaka-samhita, also spelled Caraka-samhita or Caraka-saṃhitā,  comprehensive text on ancient Indian medicine credited to Charaka, who was a practitioner of the traditional system of Indian medicine known as Ayurveda. Charaka is thought to have flourished sometime between the 2nd century bce and the 2nd century ce.
The Charaka-samhita as it exists today is thought to have arisen in the 1st century ce. Studies on ancient Indian medicine indicate, however, that the original text was written several centuries earlier by Agnivesha, who was one of six disciples of Ayurvedic scholar Punarvasu Atreya (the other five disciples were Bhela, Jatukarna, Parashara, Harita, and Ksharapani). Each of the disciples went on to compose samhitas, incorporating ideas from Atreya’s school of thought as well as their own understanding of the subject. Of those, the Agnivesha-samhita, composed by Agnivesha, was unique in depth and content. Later refined and annotated by Charaka, it came to be known as the Charaka-samhita. Charaka divided the treatise into eight parts, or ashtanga sthanas: sutra, nidana, vimana, sarira, endriya, chikitsa, kalpa, and siddha; each part contained multiple chapters.
While Charaka delved into all aspects of medicine, including the logic and philosophy behind the Indian medicinal system, he placed special emphasis on the diagnosis of disease and treated Ayurveda as a comprehensive system of health care that dealt with both preventive and curative aspects. He also dealt elaborately with subjects such as fetal generation and development, anatomy of the human body, and function and malfunction of the body according to the tridosha (the three humours of the body)—vata, pitta, and kapha. He also discussed the classification of various diseases.
