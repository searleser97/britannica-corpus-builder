Antidiarrheal drug,  any drug that relieves symptoms of diarrhea, the frequent passage of a watery loose stool. In general, the antidiarrheal drugs may be divided into different groups based on chemical or functional similarities; these groups include adsorbents, antimotility agents, and bacterial replacements (probiotics).
While the precise mechanisms of action of adsorbents remain unclear, these agents are thought to work by binding to and thereby neutralizing the actions of diarrhea-causing toxins that are produced by infectious agents or by preventing the adherence of infectious agents to the walls of the gastrointestinal tract. Examples of adsorbents used in the treatment of diarrhea include kaolin, pectin, activated charcoal, attapulgite (aluminum silicate), and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol). While these substances generally have few side effects, they are ineffective at controlling fluid loss and therefore are unable to prevent dehydration.
Opioids, such as codeine and loperamide (Imodium), and anticholinergic drugs, such as dicyclomine and atropine, may be used to slow intestinal motility and to relieve pain associated with abdominal cramping. The opiate derivative diphenoxylate typically is given with atropine in a combination marketed as Lomotil. Although opioids carry a risk of dependency and addiction, codeine and the synthetic analogs diphenoxylate and loperamide produce little dependence, and they have been used successfully for diarrhea.
Probiotics consist of harmless organisms that interfere with the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by pathogenic (disease-causing) organisms. Probiotics commonly used in the treatment of diarrhea include commercial preparations of the bacterium Lactobacillus acidophilus and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii.
