creatinine clearance,  clinical measurement used to estimate renal function, specifically the filtration rate of the glomeruli (clusters of blood vessels that are the primary filtering structures of the kidney). Creatinine is a chemical end product of creatine metabolism that is removed, or cleared, from blood plasma by glomeruli and is excreted in the urine.
The creatinine clearance value is determined by measuring the concentration of endogenous creatinine (that which is produced by the body) in both plasma and urine. Reference values for healthy creatinine clearance levels vary by age and sex. In general, reference values for men are in the range of 97–137 ml per minute and for women 88–128 ml per minute. A normal range for newborns usually is between 40 and 65 ml per minute.
Creatinine clearance generally is considered to be a practical clinical measurement with which to assess the glomerular filtration rate. A low or decreased creatinine clearance level may indicate the presence of conditions such as glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli; also called Bright disease), ureteral obstruction, or pyelonephritis (kidney infection). A declining glomerular filtration rate precedes kidney failure.
