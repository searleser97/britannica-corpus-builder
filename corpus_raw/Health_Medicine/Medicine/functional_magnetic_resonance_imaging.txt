Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),  neuroimaging technique used in biomedical research and in diagnosis that detects changes in blood flow in the brain. This technique compares brain activity under resting and activated conditions. It combines the high-spatial-resolution noninvasive imaging of brain anatomy offered by standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a strategy to distinguish between the magnetic resonance states of hemoglobin in the presence or absence of oxygen. This enables the detection of increases in blood oxygen levels when brain activity brings fresh blood to a particular area of the brain. Functional magnetic resonance imaging allows for the generation of detailed maps of brain areas that underlie human mental activities in health and disease. This technique has been applied to the study of various functions of the brain, ranging from primary sensory responses to cognitive activities.
