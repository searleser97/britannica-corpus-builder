Probenecid,  drug used in the treatment of chronic gout, a disorder that is characterized by recurrent acute attacks of inflammation in one or more joints of the extremities. Probenecid inhibits the transport of most organic acids in the renal tubules of the kidneys. It was used in medicine originally to prolong the action of the antibiotic penicillin by preventing its loss in the urine. In large doses, however, probenecid enhances the excretion of uric acid, the compound that accumulates in and about the joints in persons with gout. Continued administration of the drug in gouty arthritis shrinks solid uric acid deposits in the joints and reduces swelling in enlarged joints, thus restoring their mobility.
