Angioplasty,  therapeutic opening of a blocked blood vessel. Usually a balloon is inflated near the end of a catheter (see catheterization) to flatten plaques (see atherosclerosis) against an arteryâ€™s wall. Performed on a coronary artery, angioplasty is a less invasive alternative to coronary bypass surgery in the treatment of coronary heart disease. Often angioplasty is combined with the placement of a stent, in which a small flexible mesh tube (usually made of metal) is inserted inside the narrowed artery to hold the vessel open.
Complications, including embolisms and tearing, are rare with angioplasty. However, plaques tend to build up again after the procedure, resulting in restenosis (vessel narrowing following treatment). Drug-eluting stents can help prevent the growth of scar tissue that may cause restenosis.
Angioplasty is also used to expand a severely obstructed heart valve.
