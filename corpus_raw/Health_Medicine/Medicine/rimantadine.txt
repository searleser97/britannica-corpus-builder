Rimantadine, also called Î±-methyl-1-adamantane methylamine hydrochloride,  drug used to treat infections caused by influenza type A virus, the most common cause of influenza epidemics. Rimantadine is a derivative of the antiviral agent amantadine. It is composed of an alicyclic compound called adamantane that contains a methyl group (CH3) attached to an amine. This arrangement distinguishes rimantadine from amantadine, which contains the same alicyclic structure but bound to an amino group (NH2). Rimantadine has a higher level of activity against influenza type A than amantadine, but, similar to its parent compound, it is ineffective against influenza type B.
Rimantadine works by inhibiting a viral protein called M2, which normally mediates the transport of acid ions across the influenza virion shell. The acid ions facilitate the dissolution of the virion coat, thereby enabling the release of the viral RNA into the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Thus, by blocking M2, rimantadine blocks viral uncoating and breaks the cycle of viral replication and infection. In addition, similar to amantadine, rimantadine can act during viral replication to inhibit assembly of the influenza virus. Rimantadine-resistant strains of influenza A virus have been isolated; however, these strains do not appear to possess increased virulence relative to rimantadine-sensitive virus.
In the prevention of influenza A infection, rimantadine may be administered in moderate doses for a period of two weeks. However, in the treatment of active influenza infection the drug is typically given at high doses for about one week. Rimantadine generally has few side effects and, relative to amantadine, is less toxic to the nervous system. Common mild reactions include headache, nausea, lightheadedness, and insomnia.
