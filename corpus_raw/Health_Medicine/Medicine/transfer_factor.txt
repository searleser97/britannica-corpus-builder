Transfer factor,  small polypeptide that is produced by a type of white blood cell called a T cell and that when passed from one person to another produces cellular hypersensitivity. It was discovered in 1949 by American immunologist Henry Sherwood Lawrence at New York University. Transfer factor is unique in that the hypersensitivity it transfers to cells has properties of both passive and active immunity.
Transfer factor is a dialyzable extract, meaning that it can be separated out of an individualâ€™s immunologically active T cells. Transfer factor is prepared from the blood, but from white blood cells rather than from whole serum. The white cells are separated from the serum, concentrated, and disrupted by mechanical means to free the cell contents. The cell extract is filtered through a membrane sieve, which allows only the small molecules of the cells containing transfer factor to pass through in solution.
