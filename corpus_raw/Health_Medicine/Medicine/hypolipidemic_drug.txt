Hypolipidemic drug, also called lipid-lowering drug,  any agent the reduces the level of lipids and lipoproteins (lipid-protein complexes) in the blood. Lipoproteins bind cholesterol and can accumulate in blood vessels. High levels of specific lipoproteins, namely, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), have been associated with an elevated risk of certain forms of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, and stroke.
Statins are hypolipidemic drugs that block the enzyme HMG-CoA (5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase, which is required for the synthesis of cholesterol. Examples of statins include simvastatin, pravastatin, and lovastatin. Statins are generally quite safe, but side effects may include muscle pain and fatigue.
Bile acids, which aid in the digestion of fats, are produced in the liver from cholesterol. Bile acid sequestrants (resins) bind bile acids in the small intestine, and the drugâ€“bile acid complex is carried out of the body. To compensate, more cholesterol is converted to bile acids, which also bind to resins and are excreted, eventually resulting in a decrease in the level of cholesterol in the blood. These drugs (e.g., cholestyramine and colestipol) can affect the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins, so a supplement may be necessary.
Niacin (nicotinic acid) is one of the oldest drugs used to treat increased plasma lipid levels. Its use is limited by side effects, particularly flushing of the skin on the face and upper trunk. Niacin in large amounts can also cause liver dysfunction and liver failure.
