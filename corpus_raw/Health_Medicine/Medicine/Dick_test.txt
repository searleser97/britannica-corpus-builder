Dick test,  method of determining susceptibility to scarlet fever by injection into the skin of 0.1 cubic centimetre of scarlet fever toxin. A reddening of the skin in an area over 10 millimetres (0.4 inch) in diameter within about 24 hours indicates a lack of immunity to the disease. The test was developed in 1924 by the U.S. physicians George and Gladys Dick.
