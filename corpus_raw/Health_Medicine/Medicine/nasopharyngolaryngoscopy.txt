Nasopharyngolaryngoscopy,  diagnostic medical procedure that uses a flexible fibre-optic endoscope to visualize the structures inside the nasal passages, including the sinus openings, the larynx, and the vocal cords.

This instrument enables a more thorough examination to be performed than is possible with indirect visualization with a mirror.
