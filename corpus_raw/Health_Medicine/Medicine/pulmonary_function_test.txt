Pulmonary function test,  procedure used to measure various aspects of the working capacity and efficiency of the lungs and to aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary disease. There are two general categories of pulmonary function tests: (1) those that measure ventilatory function, or lung volumes and the process of moving gas in and out of the lungs from ambient air to the alveoli (air sacs), and (2) those measuring respiratory function, or the transfer of gas between the alveoli and the blood. Tests of ventilatory function include the following measurements: residual volume (RV), air remaining within the chest after a maximal expiration; functional residual capacity (FRC), the resting lung volume, or air within the chest at the end of a quiet expiration; tidal volume, volume of a breath; vital capacity, maximum air volume that can be expelled after a maximum inspiration; and total lung capacity (TLC), air volume within the chest in full inspiration. Except for the residual volume, which is measured by a dilution method, all the other volumes may be recorded with a spirometer; breathing movements may also be registered graphically on a spirogram.
Ventilation tests, which measure the capacity of the lungs to move air in and out, include maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), maximal air volume expelled in 12â€“15 seconds of forced breathing; forced expiratory volume (FEV), maximum air volume expelled in a time interval; and maximal expiratory flow rate (MEFR), maximal flow rate of a single expelled breath, expressed in litres of air per minute. Tests of respiratory function include the measurement of blood oxygen and carbon dioxide and the rate at which oxygen passes from the alveoli into the small blood vessels, or capillaries, of the lungs.
