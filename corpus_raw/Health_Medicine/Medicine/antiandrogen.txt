Antiandrogen,  any drug that blocks the effects of androgens (male hormones) on the body. The antiandrogens include drugs that inhibit testosterone synthesis, block androgen receptors (known as androgen-receptor antagonists), or inhibit the conversion of testosterone to its more active form, dihydrotestosterone.
A number of drugs have antiandrogenic effects. Some were designed for this purpose, but others were developed for some other therapeutic goal. For example, ketoconazole, an antifungal drug, blocks the synthesis of steroids, including testosterone and cortisol. Spironolactone, a diuretic, is also a weak inhibitor of the androgen receptor and a weak inhibitor of testosterone synthesis. Androgen-receptor antagonists such as flutamide and bicalutamide can be used in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.
In certain tissues, testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone by an enzyme called 5-alpha-reductase. An inhibitor of this enzyme, finasteride, was designed as a treatment for benign prostatic hypertrophy. When it is administered to men with moderately severe symptoms, urine flow increases and prostatic volume decreases. Impotence is an infrequent side effect of the use of finasteride, which is also approved for the topical treatment of male pattern baldness.
