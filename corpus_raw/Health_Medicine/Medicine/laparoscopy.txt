Laparoscopy, also called peritoneoscopy,  procedure that permits visual examination of the abdominal cavity with an optical instrument called a laparoscope, which is inserted through a small incision made in the abdominal wall. The term comes from the Greek words laparo, meaning “flank,” and skopein, meaning “to examine.”
The laparoscope is a type of endoscope—i.e., a device similar to a small telescope that is equipped with a light source. Laparoscopy came into use early in the 20th century. It was first used as a means of diagnosing abdominal pain. By the 1960s gynecologists were using the laparoscope in operations such as tubal ligations. Modern laparoscopes have been fitted with fibre-optic lights and small video cameras that allow a surgical team to view the abdominal tissues and organs on a monitor in the operating room. These improvements have expanded the applications of laparoscopy. Today the technique is not only used to obtain diagnostic information but employed in a variety of surgeries, including removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy), appendectomy, hysterectomy, repair of hernias, and removal of cancerous tumours.
Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure because it requires a much smaller incision than traditional surgery does, causing less damage to nerves, muscles, and skin. It can be performed with only local anesthesia and a mild sedative. To begin the procedure, carbon dioxide is pumped into the abdomen, thereby expanding the abdominal cavity to provide the physician with space to maneuver instruments. Next a small incision is made for the laparoscope. Additional tiny cuts can be made if surgical instruments such as forceps and scissors are needed in the procedure. Valuable diagnostic information can be obtained by examining a biopsy specimen of the liver or abdominal lesions. The benefits of laparoscopic surgery include a reduction in postoperative pain, brief recovery times, and shortened hospital stays.
