American College of Sports Medicine  (ACSM),  U.S. nonprofit professional organization of sports medicine physicians, practitioners, and scientists. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) was founded in New York City in 1954 as the Federation of Sports Medicine; it changed to its present name the following year. Its headquarters are in Indianapolis, Indiana. In the early 21st century, the ACSM had more than 20,000 national and international members in three categories: medicine (consisting generally of M.D.’s and Ph.D.’s), basic and applied sciences (biochemists, exercise physiologists, and directors of exercise programs), and education and allied health (professionals such as nurses, physical education teachers, and physical therapists).
The ACSM fosters sports medicine education, clinical practice, and scientific research through multiple initiatives. It hosts national and international professional meetings, provides continuing education and certification, produces newsletters and other publications, and funds research in the field. Its official journal, Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, presents multidisciplinary research. The organization provides a number of continuing educational opportunities through online courses, certification workshops, and regional chapter meetings. In addition to its official journal, the association’s publications include Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews, ACSM’s Health & Fitness Journal, and Current Sports Medicine Reports. The ACSM certifies individuals in health and fitness fields such as personal training and clinical exercise physiology. It also promotes the development of scientific knowledge applicable to clinical practice. The ACSM Foundation, established in 1984, raises and distributes funds both to the college and to individuals as research awards.
