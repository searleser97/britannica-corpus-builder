Mucosal protective agent,  any drug that protects the mucosal lining of the stomach from acidic gastric juices.
The mucosal barrier is the name given to the barrier in the stomach that resists the back-diffusion of hydrogen ions. The barrier is a layer of thick mucus secreted together with an alkaline fluid. Since the mucus is a gel, it entraps the alkaline fluid so that the stomach is coated.
Sucralfate, a polymer of sucrose with aluminum hydroxide, forms a protective coating on the mucosal lining, particularly in ulcerated areas. In the presence of acid, it becomes a gel that adheres to epithelial cells and ulcer craters. Sucralfate is only minimally absorbed and can cause constipation.
Misoprostal is a prostaglandin analog that increases release of bicarbonate and mucin (a component of mucus) and reduces acid secretion by binding to prostaglandin receptors on parietal cells. Because NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) inhibit prostaglandin formation, a synthetic prostaglandin such as misoprostal is sometimes given to reduce NSAID-induced damage.
