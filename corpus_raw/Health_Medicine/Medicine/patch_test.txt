Patch test,   controlled application of biological or chemical substances to the skin in order to detect if the subject has an allergic hypersensitivity to one of them. The test was originally developed to test new chemical compounds for their allergic potential on animals but has since become widely used to diagnose allergies in humans. Patch testing is usually done on the skin of the upper back or the outer arm. Small amounts of test substances diluted in a solvent such as water or petroleum jelly are applied to the skin under a patch of cloth or soft paper and an impermeable membrane. The patch is left in place for 48 hours, after which the skin reaction is examined and scored from 0 (no apparent reaction) to 4+, indicating severe blistering as well as angry redness of the exposed skin. Patch testing is an extremely accurate indicator of allergic sensitivity.
