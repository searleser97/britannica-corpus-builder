Protease inhibitor,  class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV retrovirus infection in AIDS patients. Protease inhibitors are characterized by their ability to block activation of an HIV enzyme called protease. The protease enzyme is involved in the synthesis of new viral particles, which can lead to the spread of HIV to uninfected cells. However, in the presence of a protease inhibitor HIV produces only noninfectious viral particles. Examples of protease inhibitors include ritonavir, saquinavir, and indinavir.
Single-agent therapy with a protease inhibitor can result in the selection of drug-resistant HIV. Therefore, protease inhibitors are generally used in combination with other antiretroviral agents, especially agents that act at different points in the life cycle of HIV. For example, the use of a protease inhibitor in combination with a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which blocks the conversion of retroviral RNA into DNA, suppresses HIV replication better than either drug alone. The most effective combination therapy used to suppress the emergence of resistant virus is highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which combines three or more reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors.
The principal adverse effects of protease inhibitors are nausea and diarrhea. Long-term use can bring on a syndrome known as lipodystrophy (wasting of peripheral fat, accumulation of central fat, increased levels of fat in the blood, and insulin resistance).
