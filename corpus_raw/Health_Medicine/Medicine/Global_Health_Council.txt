Global Health Council, formerly (1972–98) National Council of International Health,  global nonprofit alliance devoted to improving health around the world. It comprises corporations, foundations, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and universities. The National Council of International Health was created in 1972 and was renamed the Global Health Council in 1998. The group has offices in Washington, D.C., and White River Junction, Vt.
The work of the Global Health Council addresses the key issues of children’s health, health systems, HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, women’s health, and climate change. It describes itself as a “voice for action” that organizes grassroots movements on global health issues. The group disseminates information through a variety of publications, including Global Health Magazine; sponsors symposia and conferences on health; and forms coalitions and convenes roundtables that focus on its target areas. It also gives four annual awards for achievements in global health: the Gates Award for Global Health, the Jonathan Mann Award for Global Health and Human Rights, the Excellence in Media Award for Global Health, and the Best Practices in Global Health Award.
The group’s membership is open to individuals as well as organizations. Until 1998 the Global Health Council was funded primarily through U.S. government grants. In pursuit of greater independence, however, the group began to seek diverse funding sources, and by 2003 just 20 percent of the group’s funding came from the government, with the rest primarily from private foundations.
