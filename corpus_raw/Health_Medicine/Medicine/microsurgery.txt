Microsurgery, also called Micromanipulation, or Micrurgy,  the specialized surgical technique of observing through a compound microscope when operating on minute structures of the human body. Microsurgery has made possible significant advances in surgery on humans, especially in delicate operations on the inner ear, eye, brain, and nerve fibres and small blood vessels in general. The technique also has applications in research on cells, cell constituents, and embryos and is used in various other biomedical areas of study.
In microsurgery, the surgeon observes the body structure he is operating on through a microscope rather than by gazing directly at it. Some operating microscopes are equipped with television cameras so the progress of the operation can be observed on a television monitor. An entire repertoire of tiny precision instruments has been developed for use in microsurgery.
Micromanipulative techniques were first applied to surgery in the 1920s for use on the delicate bones of the inner ear. The techniques had been expanded by the 1950s to include surgery on tiny blood vessels and nerve strands. Microsurgery has made possible operations that otherwise simply could not be performed. Most dramatically, severed limbs or digits can be reattached to the body through the microsurgically guided reconnection of severed muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerve fibres. Repairs of the eyeâ€™s retina, the removal of previously inaccessible tumours from the brain and spinal cord, and a host of other feats can also be performed.
