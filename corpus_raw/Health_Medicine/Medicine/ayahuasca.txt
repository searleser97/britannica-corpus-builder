Ayahuasca, also called caapi, yajé, or yagé,  hallucinogenic drink made from the stem and bark of the tropical liana Banisteriopsis caapi and other botanical ingredients. First formulated by indigenous South Americans of the Amazon basin, ayahuasca is now used in many parts of the world. Some users experience visions and sensations, while others claim that the potion has healing powers.
Ayahuasca is made by soaking or boiling the stems of B. caapi (sometimes called ayahuasco), a tropical vine of the order Malpighiales, with the leaves of the chacruna plant (Psychotria viridis). Alternatively, the leaves of certain other plants, most notably the chagropanga plant (Diplopterys cabrerana), may be used. B. caapi is a source of harmine, an alkaloid that inhibits the breakdown in the digestive system of DMT (dimethyltryptamine), the psychoactive substance that the other plant supplies.
For uncounted centuries, plant-derived psychoactive drugs have played an important part in South American traditional religions. The English botanist Richard Spruce first encountered ayahuasca and B. caapi in 1851. As knowledge of ayahuasca’s psychotropic effects spread in the late 20th century, Peru experienced an influx of tourists seeking the drink. DMT is illegal in most countries, including the United States, where it is classed as a Schedule I controlled substance. Even so, ayahuasca cults have proliferated in the 21st century. Batches of the potion are typically prepared by a shaman or ayahuascero and ingested by devotees in groups. Participants are advised to avoid certain foods and drugs beforehand to avoid dangerous interactions. Nausea is a normal side effect.
