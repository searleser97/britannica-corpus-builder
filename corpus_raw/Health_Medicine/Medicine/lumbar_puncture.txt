Lumbar puncture, also called spinal tap,  direct aspiration (fluid withdrawal) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a hollow needle. The needle is inserted in the lower back, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, where the CSF is located.
Lumbar puncture is generally performed to obtain pressure measurements and to withdraw CSF in order to secure a sample of the fluid for cellular, chemical, and bacteriologic examination. In some cases lumbar puncture is used to administer spinal anesthetics or antibiotics or to inject air or a radiopaque or water-soluble contrast medium substance for myelography. Lumbar puncture plays an important role in the diagnosis of certain conditions, including hydrocephalus, meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (leakage of blood into the central nervous system).
The analysis of CSF obtained by lumbar puncture gives clues to various disease processes. In healthy individuals the fluid is normally crystal clear and colourless. However, it will contain blood if subarachnoid hemorrhage has occurred. The presence of white blood cells or bacteria is indicative of infection. Viral meningitis can be differentiated from bacterial meningitis by the type of white blood cells identified in the CSF. In addition, culturing a sample of the fluid to determine whether bacteria are present is an effective way to distinguish between different causes of meningitis. Fluctuations in CSF glucose and protein levels also are important indicators of disease. For example, the amount of protein in CSF is increased in individuals with meningitis or a tumour. The presence of infection or a tumour is also indicated by elevated fluid pressure.
