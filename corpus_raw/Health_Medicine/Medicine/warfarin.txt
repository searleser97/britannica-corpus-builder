warfarin,  anticoagulant drug, marketed as Coumadin. Originally developed to treat thromboembolism (see thrombosis), it interferes with the liverâ€™s metabolism of vitamin K, leading to production of defective coagulation factors. Warfarin therapy risks uncontrollable hemorrhage, either spontaneously or from any cut or bruise; it requires frequent checks to maintain the proper level in the blood. In high concentrations, warfarin is used as a rodent poison, causing death by internal bleeding.
