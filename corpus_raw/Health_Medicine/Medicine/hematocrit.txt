Hematocrit, also spelled haematocrit,  diagnostic procedure for the analysis of blood. The name is also used for the apparatus in which this procedure is performed and for the results of the analysis. In the procedure, an anticoagulant is added to a blood sample held in a calibrated tube. The tube is allowed to stand for one hour, after which the sedimentation rate (how rapidly blood cells settle out from plasma) is determined. Most acute generalized infections and some local infections raise the rate of sedimentation. A raised sedimentation rate may be among the first signs of an otherwise hidden disease.
In the second phase of the procedure, the tube is centrifuged so that its contents separate into three layersâ€”packed red blood cells (erythrocytes) at the bottom, a reddish gray layer of white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets in the middle, and plasma at the top. The hematocrit is expressed as the percentage of the total blood volume occupied by the packed red blood cells. The depths of these layers are indicative of health or disease: the red blood cell layer is abnormally thick in the disease polycythemia and too thin in iron-deficiency anemia; white blood cells are too abundant in leukemia; and plasma is deep yellow in jaundice (often caused by liver disease). The hematocrit is among the most commonly used of all laboratory diagnostic procedures.
