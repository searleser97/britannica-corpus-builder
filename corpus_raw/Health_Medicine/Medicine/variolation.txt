Variolation,  obsolete method of immunizing patients against smallpox by infecting them with substance from the pustules of patients with a mild form of the disease (variola minor). The disease then usually occurs in a less-dangerous form than when contracted naturally. The method was popularized in England in 1721â€“22 by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; it has long been known by the Turks, Chinese, and other peoples. In America, Cotton Mather learned of its use in Africa from his slave, Onesimus, who himself had been inoculated. Its use spread in America after 1721, and in 1728 it was introduced into South America. Variolation continued to be opposed by some religious groups and most physicians, who were not convinced of the safety of the method. It was supplanted by vaccination after 1798. In 1842 an act of Parliament in England made the practice of variolation a felony in that country.
