Antiemetic,  any drug that is used to prevent vomiting. Broadly, antiemetics may be divided into two groups: drugs that are effective in combating motion sickness and drugs that are effective against nausea and vomiting due to other causes. The exact way in which these drugs work is not known, although they may act by depressing the chemoreceptor trigger zone, which is located in the hypothalamus of the brain and controls vomiting.
Anticholinergic drugs and antihistamines are effective against motion sickness. Although many are available for use, none is entirely free from side effects (e.g., dry mouth and blurred vision with the anticholinergics, drowsiness with the antihistamines). The most-effective drugs in this group are the anticholinergic drug scopolamine and the antihistamine promethazine.
Nausea and vomiting other than that associated with motion sickness are present in many diseasesâ€”e.g., radiation sickness, postoperative vomiting, and liver disease. In these cases, the most-effective antiemetics are the phenothiazines (also used in psychiatric medicine) and metoclopramide. Serotonin antagonists, such as ondansetron, have proved effective in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy.
