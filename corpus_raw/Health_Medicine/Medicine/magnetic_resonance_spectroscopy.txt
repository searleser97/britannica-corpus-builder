Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), also called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,  diagnostic imaging technique based on the detection of metabolites in tissues. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is related to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in that it uses the same machinery; however, instead of measuring blood flow, MRS measures the concentration of specific chemicals, such as neurotransmitters. MRS holds great promise in the diagnosis of diseases of the brain and of other parts of the body, including cancers of the cervix, pancreas, and prostate.
By measuring the molecular and metabolic changes that occur in the brain, this technique has provided valuable information on brain development and aging, Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, autism, and stroke. Because it is noninvasive, MRS is ideal for studying the natural course of a disease or its response to treatment. See also nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance.
