Zanamivir,  antiviral drug that is active against both influenza type A and influenza type B viruses. Zanamivir and a similar agent called oseltamivir (marketed as Tamiflu) were approved in 1999 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and represented the first members in a new class of antiviral drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors. Zanamivir is sold under the trade name Relenza by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline.
Zanamivir is given by inhalation only. By inhibiting the neuraminidase glycoprotein on the surface of the influenza virus, zanamivir decreases the release of virus from infected cells, increases the formation of viral aggregates, and decreases the spread of the virus through the body. If taken within 30 hours of the onset of influenza, zanamivir can shorten the duration of the illness. Zanamivir, when taken once daily for 10â€“28 days, can prevent influenza infection in some adults and children.
