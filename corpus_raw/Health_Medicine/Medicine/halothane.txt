Halothane, also called 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane, or fluothane,  nonflammable, volatile, liquid drug introduced into medicine in the 1950s and used as a general anesthetic. Halothane rapidly achieved acceptance and became the most frequently used of the potent anesthetics, despite its substantially higher cost than ether and chloroform and its tendency to depress respiration and circulation. Its vapours are not nauseating or irritating to mucous membranes.
