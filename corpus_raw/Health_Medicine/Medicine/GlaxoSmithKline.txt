GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), formerly Glaxo Wellcome,  British-based pharmaceutical company with research-and-development centres in the United States, Belgium, and China as well as the United Kingdom. The company’s  products include treatments for migraines, heart failure, and cancer, as well as vaccines for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and whooping cough. Additional products include dental-care products, over-the-counter medications, nutritional drinks, and smoking-cessation products.
The company’s history began in London in 1715, when Silvanus Bevan established Plough Court Pharmacy, which later became Allen and Hanburys, Ltd. In the United States, John K. Smith opened a drugstore in Philadelphia in 1830. After his brother, George, joined him in 1841, the business became known as John K. Smith and Co. The company later changed its name to Smith and Shoemaker, which hired Mahlon Kline as a bookkeeper in 1865. Ten years later, the company name became Smith, Kline and Co. In 1873, the parent company of Glaxo was founded by Joseph Nathan in Wellington, New Zealand. More than a century and many new formations and mergers later, Glaxo Wellcome acquired SmithKline Beecham in 2000 to form GlaxoSmithKline.
