NSAID, in full nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug,  drug that reduces inflammation and is effective against pain (see analgesic) and fever. Most NSAIDs are available without prescription and are usually used for short periods for mild pain.
NSAIDs work by inhibiting the synthesis of molecules known as prostaglandins, which are important mediators of inflammation and pain. Prostaglandins are synthesized in the blood vessel wall and act locally to relax blood vessels, resulting in increased blood flow. Following insult or injury to tissues, this process results in inflammation.
Aspirin is technically an NSAID, but the term is generally applied to a newer class of drugs, including ibuprofen and similar drugs (e.g., naproxen, ketoprofen) that, like aspirin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. They tend to produce only mild side effects, though prolonged use or overuse can result in gastrointestinal bleeding; the drugs are also associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects.
