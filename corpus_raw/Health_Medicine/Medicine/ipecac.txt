Ipecac, oripecacuanha,  dried rhizome and roots of the tropical New World plant Carapichea ipecacuanha of the madder family (Rubiaceae). It has been used since ancient times especially as a source of a drug to treat poisoning by inducing nausea and vomiting. The name also refers to the drug itself, which is also known as ipecac syrup or syrup of ipecac. Its use as an emetic has been discouraged in Western medicine in favour of more effective treatments.
