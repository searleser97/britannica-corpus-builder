Beta-blocker, in full beta-adrenergic blocking agent,  any of a group of synthetic drugs used in the treatment of a wide range of diseases and conditions of the sympathetic nervous system. Stimulation by epinephrine of beta-adrenoreceptors, which are predominately found in cells of the heart and also are present in vascular and other smooth muscles, results in excitation of the sympathetic nervous system. Beta-blockers diminish reaction at the beta-adrenoreceptors, thereby preventing or decreasing excitation. The drugs are prescribed to control anxiety and hypertension and to treat a variety of cardiac conditions, including angina pectoris and cardiac arrythmias. They are also used in the treatment of glaucoma and to reduce the incidence of migraine headaches. The drugs have proved to be successful in reducing a personâ€™s risk of a second heart attack.
