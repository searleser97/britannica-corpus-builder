Mescaline, also called Î²-3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine,  naturally occurring alkaloid, the active principle contained in the flowering heads of the peyote cactus (species Lophophora williamsii) of Mexico and the southwestern United States, that has been used as a drug to induce hallucination. The mescaline molecule is related structurally to two hormones secreted by the adrenal glands, adrenaline and noradrenaline; both are catecholamine compounds that take part in the transmission of nerve impulses. Mescaline was isolated as the active principle of peyote in 1896, and its structural resemblance to adrenaline was recognized by 1919.
In experiments mescaline requires 2 to 3 hours for onset of action, and its effects sometimes last for more than 12 hours. The hallucinatory effects vary greatly among individuals and even for a particular individual from one drug session to the next. The variations seem to reflect such factors as the mood and personality of the subject and the setting in which the drug is administered. Hallucinations are usually visual, less often auditory. Side effects include nausea and vomiting. Mescaline is prepared from the peyote cactus by extraction and purification, but it can be synthesized.
