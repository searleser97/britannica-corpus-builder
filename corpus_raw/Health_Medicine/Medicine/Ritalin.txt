Ritalin, generic name methylphenidate,  a mild form of amphetamine used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a condition that occurs primarily in children and is characterized by hyperactivity, inability to concentrate for long periods of time, and impulsivity. Ritalin, a trade-name drug, also has been effective for the treatment of other conditions such as narcolepsy. Although it acts as a stimulant in most people, Ritalin calms and focuses people with ADHD. Ritalinâ€™s mode of action is unknown, but researchers speculate that the drug reduces the symptoms of ADHD by increasing the amount and activity of a neurotransmitter in the brain.
