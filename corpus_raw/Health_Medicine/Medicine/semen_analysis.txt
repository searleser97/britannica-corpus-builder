Semen analysis,  laboratory examination of a sample of seminal fluid, usually consisting of the determination of semen volume, alkalinity or acidity (pH), sperm number (or sperm count), and the motility, shape, and viability of sperm. An examination of seminal fluid is usually undertaken to check for possible male infertility. In addition to obtaining a complete history, performing a physical examination of both partners, and verifying that ovulation does occur in the woman, the physician will perform a semen analysis. Normal semen contains more than 60 million sperm per millilitre. More than 60 percent of the sperm are motile two hours after ejaculation, and 80â€“90 percent will have normal form and structure. Possible causes of infertility are a low sperm count, low motility, or a low percentage of normal forms. Rarely, a sperm analysis may be required in a case of suspected rape.
