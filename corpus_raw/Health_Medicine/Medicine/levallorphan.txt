Levallorphan,  drug derived from morphine that can activate certain receptors and inhibit others. Levallorphan’s mixed actions are a result of its ability to bind to two different kinds of opioid receptors (so-called because they are the natural receptors for opiates, or narcotics). At kappa (κ) opioid receptors, levallorphan acts as an activator, or agonist, producing mild analgesic (pain-relieving) effects of little use in medicine. However, at mu (μ) opioid receptors, the drug acts as a competitive inhibitor, or antagonist, by occupying μ receptors and thus preventing narcotic substances from binding to and exerting their actions through these receptors. As a result, the primary medical uses of levallorphan include diagnosing narcotic addiction and treating respiratory depression caused in acute narcotic poisoning. When administered to narcotic addicts, levallorphan precipitates acute withdrawal symptoms.
