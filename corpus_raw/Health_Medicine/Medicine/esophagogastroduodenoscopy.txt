Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD),  diagnostic procedure in which an endoscope is passed through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum in order to visually examine the tissues for evidence of disease. The flexible fibre-optic endoscope contains special channels, which facilitate biopsy, and usually has a small video camera attached to record visually recognizable abnormalities.
EGD is indicated when symptoms of peptic ulcer persist despite an adequate trial of treatment or when there is upper gastrointestinal bleeding or a suspicion of upper gastrointestinal cancer. It is also indicated if there is an esophageal stricture or obstruction or persistent vomiting of unknown cause. Esophageal strictures, if benign, can be successfully dilated, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be controlled by means of electrocoagulation. If the bleeding is from esophageal varices, they can be injected with a sclerosing (hardening) agent. A tissue sample from any suspicious lesion of the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum can be removed and examined (a biopsy) to make the specific tissue diagnosis that is necessary when deciding on the most appropriate therapy.
