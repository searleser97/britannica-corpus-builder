Sex therapy,   form of behaviour modification or psychotherapy directed specifically at difficulties in sexual interaction. Many sex therapists use techniques developed in the 1960s by the Americans William Masters and Virginia Johnson to help couples with nonorganic problems that affect their sex lives, including premature ejaculation, impotence, and other forms of sexual dysfunction. In the Masters and Johnson technique, a sex history is first taken and the couple given physical examinations to rule out physical problems. Therapists then employ exercises focusing on the giving and receiving of sensual, but not necessarily sexual, pleasure to help the couple overcome anxieties about sex. Specialized treatments directed against specific sex-related problems are also used during therapy. The therapy process often takes place in an intensive marital workshop lasting for several days.
Although the Masters and Johnson approach involves both members of the couple, sex therapy can take other forms. Comarital therapy refers to the Masters and Johnson model, in which both members of the couple are treated by a team consisting of one male and one female therapist. The couple approach recognizes that sexual dysfunctions take place in the context of the interaction between two people and are not the exclusive problem of one member of the pair. Individual therapy is employed for those without cooperating partners and may involve the use of a surrogate partner or may focus on exercises that can be practiced by an individual to improve his or her sexual interactions. Group therapy, in which individuals discuss feelings about sex, is also employed for both single-sex and maleâ€“female groups.
