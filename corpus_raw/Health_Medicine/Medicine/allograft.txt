Allograft, also called allogeneic transplant, homograft,  in medical procedures, the transfer of tissue between genetically nonidentical members of the same species, although of a compatible blood type. Allografts are commonly used in the transplants of skin, corneas, hearts, livers, kidneys, and bone and bone marrow, although transplants of the last often come from relatives.
In addition to allografts, there are three other types of tissue transplants. An isograft is when tissue is transplanted from a genetically identical donor, such as an identical twin. An autograft occurs when tissue is transplanted from one site to another site on a patient, such as for skin grafts after the removal of melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers. A xenograft refers to transplants made between different species.
