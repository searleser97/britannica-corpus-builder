Dimercaprol, also called British anti-lewisite (BAL),  drug that was originally developed to combat the effects of the blister gas lewisite, which was used in chemical warfare. By the end of World War II, dimercaprol had also been found useful as an antidote against poisoning by several metals and semimetals—including arsenic, gold, lead, and mercury—that act by combining with cellular sulfhydryl groups. Dimercaprol is more effective if its use is begun within two hours after ingestion of the toxic metal. Because of its instability in water, it is administered by intramuscular injection of a solution of it in peanut oil.
