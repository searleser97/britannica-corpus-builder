Massage,   in medicine, systematic and scientific manipulation of body tissues, performed with the hands for therapeutic effect on the nervous and muscular systems and on systemic circulation. It was used more than 3,000 years ago by the Chinese. Later, the Greek physician Hippocrates used friction in the treatment of sprains and dislocations and kneading to treat constipation. Early in the 19th century, Per Henrik Ling, a doctor in Stockholm, devised a system of massage to treat ailments involving joints and muscles. Others later extended the treatment to relieve deformities of arthritis and re-educate muscles following paralysis.
Massage is used to relieve pain and reduce swelling, to relax muscles, and to speed the healing process following strain and sprain injuries. Massage, however, cannot prevent loss of muscle strength nor reduce fat deposits.
There are three forms of hand manipulation employed in therapeutic massage. They are: light or hard stroking (effleurage), which relaxes muscles and improves circulation to the small surface blood vessels and is thought to increase the flow of blood toward the heart; compression (petrissage), which includes kneading, squeezing, and friction and is useful in stretching scar tissue, muscles, and tendons so that movement is easier; and percussion (tapotement), in which the sides of the hands are used to strike the surface of the skin in rapid succession to improve circulation.
