Cryotherapy,  the therapeutic use of cold to control inflammation and edema, decrease pain, reduce spasticity, and facilitate movement. Tissue cooling is achieved through the application of cold through the skin.
Indications for cryotherapy include acute injury or inflammation, acute or chronic pain due to muscle spasm, edema/swelling, spasticity accompanying a central nervous system disorder, painful limitation of motion secondary to immobilization, and first-degree burns. Contraindications include cold hypersensitivity, circulatory compromise, history of frostbite, leukemia, and/or systemic lupus. Precautions are taken in the case of open wounds, hypertension, poor sensation, aversion to cold, poor mentation, prolonged application over a superficial nerve, and patients who are very young or very old. Adverse reactions can include tissue death, frostbite, nerve damage, and unwanted opening of the blood vessels (yielding increasing blood flow).
One of the most common forms of cryotherapy is a cold pack, which is a superficial physical agent that reduces tissue temperature by means of conduction. Cold packs are typically composed of an outer vinyl pouch filled with a silica gel mixture that is kept between 0 °C and 5 °C. 
Ice massage is another convenient and easy form of cryotherapy. An ice cup (a paper cup filled with water that has been frozen) is used to massage the area in small, overlapping circles. Also used is a contrast bath, in which the affected region is immersed in warm or hot water, followed by cool or cold water.
