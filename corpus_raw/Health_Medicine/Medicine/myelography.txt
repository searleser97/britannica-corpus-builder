Myelography,   medical procedure for examining the spinal cord by means of X rays. It is especially useful in diagnosing spinal abscesses and tumours and dislocated intervertebral disks.
In this procedure a positive contrast agent, usually in the form of a water-soluble radiopaque substance or iodinated oil, is injected into the spinal canal. This contrast agent, which makes body tissue more visible when irradiated with X rays, is maneuvered throughout the spinal canal from the lumbrosacral (tail bone) region up to the base of the brain by tilting the examination table to which the patient is strapped. A fluoroscope is used to observe the various parts of the canal as the contrast agent passes through them. The contrast medium is generally removed after a myelogram has been completed, though the use of certain water-soluble radiopaque substances makes this step unnecessary since they are readily eliminated from the body by natural means. Iodinated oil may cause irritations, resulting in temporary discomfort.
