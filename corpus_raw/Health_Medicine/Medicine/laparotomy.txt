Laparotomy, also called celiotomy,  opening of the abdominal (or peritoneal) cavity. After laparotomy became reasonably safe, the whole field of abdominal surgery unfolded.
Laparotomy requires (1) a safe cutting into the abdominal cavity through the skin, fat, muscles, muscular aponeuroses, and peritoneum in that order from the exterior inward; (2) the repair or removal of intra-abdominal organs while the surgeon is working inside the cavity; and (3) a safe and meticulous closure. If the abdominal wall is not closed properly, wound disruption, or possibly wound evisceration, may result. Because of an inherent resistance to infection on the part of the peritoneum, infection of the laparotomy wound may occur without accompanying peritonitis. Such wound infection, faulty technique, and the high pressure produced within the peritoneal cavity by coughing or straining are the main causes of laparotomy wound disruption.
