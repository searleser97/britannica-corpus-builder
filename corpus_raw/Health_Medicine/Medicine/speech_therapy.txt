Speech therapy,  therapeutic treatment to correct defects in speaking. Such defects may originate in the brain, the ear (see deafness), or anywhere along the vocal tract and may affect the voice, articulation, language development, or ability to speak after language is learned. Therapy begins with diagnosis of underlying physical, physiological, or emotional dysfunction. It may involve training in breathing, use of the voice, and speaking habits. Some abnormalities that cause speech disorders (e.g., cleft palate, stroke) can be corrected to various degrees before a speech therapistâ€™s work begins. See also aphasia, stuttering.
