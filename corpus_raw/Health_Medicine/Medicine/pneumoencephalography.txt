Pneumoencephalography,  technique of diagnostic radiology that produces X-ray films of the head after injection of air or gas between the membranes lining the brain and spinal cord to sharpen the outlines of various brain structures. The air or gas is introduced, in small increments, by exchange with cerebrospinal fluid, into the lower back, with the patient in the sitting position. Pneumoencephalography reveals such conditions as hydrocephalus (abnormal accumulation of fluid within the cranial cavity), mass lesions that displace or deform the brain ventricles (cavities), and atrophic states of the brain tissues. In ventriculography the air or gas is injected directly into the brain ventricles.
Pneumoencephalography, a painful and sometimes dangerous procedure, has been largely displaced by the techniques of computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. Today, the technique is used only in rare instances.
