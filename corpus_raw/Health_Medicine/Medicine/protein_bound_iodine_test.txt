Protein-bound iodine test, also called PBI test,  laboratory test that indirectly assesses thyroid function by measuring the concentration of iodine bound to proteins circulating in the bloodstream. Thyroid hormones are formed by the addition of iodine to the amino acid tyrosine and are normally transported in the bloodstream by carrier proteins. In the PBI test, these carrier proteins are precipitated from the blood, and the quantity of bound iodine is measured. Under certain abnormal circumstances, protein-bound iodine may be partly derived from iodinated substances other than the thyroid hormones. The butanol-extraction iodine test, which roughly parallels the PBI test, serves to separate the thyroid hormones from other types of iodinated components. Today the PBI test has been replaced by tests capable of measuring thyroid hormone levels directly. See also thyroid function test.
