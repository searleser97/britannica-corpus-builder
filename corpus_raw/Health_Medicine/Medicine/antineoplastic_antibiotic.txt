Antineoplastic antibiotic, also called anticancer antibiotic or antitumour antibiotic,  any anticancer drug that affects DNA synthesis and replication by inserting into DNA or by donating electrons that result in the production of highly reactive oxygen compounds (superoxide) that cause breakage of DNA strands. These antibiotics are administered almost exclusively by intravenous infusion for the treatment of lymphoma and leukemia, nephroblastoma (Wilm tumour), sarcoma, and cancers of the testicle, the breast, the thyroid, the lung, and the stomach.
Examples of antineoplastic antibiotics include doxorubicin, daunorubicin, bleomycin, mitomycin, and dactinomycin, all of which are derived from species of Streptomyces bacteria. While these drugs may have antibacterial activity, they are generally too dangerous and toxic for that use. Antineoplastic antibiotics are associated with blood cell damage, hair loss, and other toxicities common to the antimetabolites and alkylating agents, and severe cardiac or lung toxicity also results. The effects vary in proportion to the dose and length of treatment.
