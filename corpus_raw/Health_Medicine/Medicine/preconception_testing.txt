Preconception testing,  any of several screening and diagnostic procedures that provide information about the health of individuals who are planning to conceive a child.
Using careful review of family histories of both parents and DNA testing for many different gene mutations, preconception testing attempts to reduce the risk of conceiving children who will be born with a disability. For example, if there is a strong family history of spina bifida or anencephaly, folic acid is recommended for prospective mothers prior to conception and for the first three months of the pregnancy. Likewise, genetic testing technologies permit the identification of genetic predispositions. The risk of inheritance of genetic disorders by a coupleâ€™s offspring can be reduced with strategies such as the selection of a low-risk sperm or egg donor. In some conditions pharmacologic, behavioral, or monitoring strategies can also be used to reduce the risk of disability.
