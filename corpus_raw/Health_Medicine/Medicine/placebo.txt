Placebo,  an inert, or dummy, drug. Placebos are sometimes prescribed for maladies with no known scientific treatment or in cases in which an ailment has not yet been diagnosed. They are also used in tests involving responses to new drugs. In a blind test the patient does not know whether he or she is given the real drug or a placebo. In a double blind test neither the patient nor the physician knows.
