Proton pump inhibitor,  any drug that suppresses the secretion of gastric acid by inhibiting an enzyme in the parietal cells of the stomach that exchanges acid for potassium ions. The proton pump inhibitors are used in the treatment of erosive esophagitis and peptic ulcer. When given in sufficient dosage, these drugs can reduce acid secretion by more than 95 percent. Examples of proton pump inhibitors include omeprazole, lansoprazole, and rabeprazole.
Although effective in some patients, the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with potentially serious side effects, including increased risk of premature death and the development of stomach cancer, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease.
