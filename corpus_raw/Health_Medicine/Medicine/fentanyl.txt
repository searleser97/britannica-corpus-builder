fentanyl, also called N-(1-phenethyl-4-piperidyl)propionanilide,  synthetic narcotic analgesic drug, the most potent narcotic in clinical use (50 to 100 times more potent than morphine). The citrate salt, fentanyl citrate, is administered by injection, either intramuscularly or intravenously, sometimes in combination with a potent tranquilizer. The duration of its pain-relieving action is short.
Fentanyl exerts its pain-relieving effects by acting on opioid receptors that occur naturally in the body. Endorphins, the substances in the body that normally bind to opioid receptors and naturally relieve pain, are also connected with “pleasure centres” in the brain. Repeated activation of these centres by narcotic drugs is suspected of playing a role in drug addiction. Hence, fentanyl, similar to other narcotic drugs, carries a high risk of addiction and accidental overdose. In the second decade of the 21st century in the United States, fentanyl was one of the deadliest drugs of abuse.
