Antiprogestin,  any substance that blocks the synthesis or action of the hormone progesterone. Antiprogestins are used for contraception, labour induction, and treatment of endometriosis and breast cancer. Mifepristone was the first antiprogestin to be described and was marketed under various trade names, including RU-486. It is effective at inducing abortion in the early weeks of pregnancy (see abortifacient).
