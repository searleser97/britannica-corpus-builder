Glucose tolerance test,  procedure to assess the ability of the body to metabolize glucose, the principal type of sugar found in the blood.
In persons with normal or slightly elevated blood-sugar levels, the body tolerance to sugar is measured in a stressful situation induced by administering a large amount of glucose. The most common procedure is to take an initial blood sample from a fasting individual, have the individual empty his or her bladder, and then administer orally 50–100 grams of glucose (usually 1 gram of glucose per kilogram of ideal body weight) dissolved in water. Samples of blood and urine for glucose determination are obtained 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 3 hours later. Normally the concentration of glucose in the blood will rise to about 140 mg/100 ml within 45–60 minutes and will return in 1 1/2–2 1/2 hours to the normal range of 80–120 mg/100 ml. The most valuable diagnostic point is 2 hours, when the value should be less than 120 mg/100 ml.
A fasting glucose tolerance test can convey important information about decreased tolerance to sugar in persons suffering from an impairment of sugar metabolism, such as diabetes mellitus. In these individuals a decreased tolerance to sugar is manifested by a blood-sugar-level curve that rises higher than, and returns more slowly to, normal. This type of curve may also be seen in nondiabetic persons during acute illness, after trauma, or when on a low-carbohydrate diet; it may also be observed in elderly persons with hardening of the arteries or heart disease and in middle-aged persons who are markedly overweight.
An oral glucose tolerance test is used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus when a fasting blood glucose test result is not definitive (i.e., greater than the upper range of the normal value but less than the diagnostic level for diabetes). Even if a blood glucose test is obtained after fasting 10–12 hours and the level is above 140 mg/100 ml, it is important to confirm the result with a second determination to rule out other factors that may have given a one-time abnormal test result.
The oral glucose tolerance test measures the response of the body to a challenge load (an amount calculated to evoke a response) of glucose. It most often is used during pregnancy to detect early glucose intolerance that could pose a significant risk to the infant if the condition progressed to gestational diabetes mellitus. After a fasting blood glucose test result has been obtained, 75 grams of glucose (100 g if the patient is pregnant) is administered and blood samples are taken every 30 minutes for 2 hours. In patients with diabetes, the blood glucose value will rise to a higher level and remain higher longer than in individuals who do not have diabetes.
A simpler but less-reliable screening test is the 2-hour postprandial blood glucose test. This test is performed 2 hours after intake of a standard glucose solution or a meal containing 100 grams of carbohydrates. A plasma glucose level above 140 mg/100 ml indicates the need for a glucose tolerance test.
