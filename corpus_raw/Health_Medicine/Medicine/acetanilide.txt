Acetanilide,   synthetic organic compound introduced in therapy in 1886 as a fever-reducing drug. Its effectiveness in relieving pain was discovered soon thereafter, and it was used as an alternative to aspirin for many years in treating such common complaints as headache, menstrual cramps, and rheumatism. Excessive or prolonged use engenders toxic side effects: it interferes with the function of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying pigment of the blood. In the body acetanilide is mostly converted to acetaminophen, which has replaced acetanilide in therapy because it is less likely to induce blood disorders.
