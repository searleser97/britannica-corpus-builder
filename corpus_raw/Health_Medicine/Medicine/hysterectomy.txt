Hysterectomy,   surgical removal of the complete uterus (total hysterectomy) or of the complete uterus except for the cervix (subtotal hysterectomy). The cervix is the outermost portion of the uterus, which projects into the vagina. Removal of the uterus is indicated in a number of abnormal situations, including the presence of a cancer or of a benign tumour of the type called myoma, or fibroid tumour, if the myoma is large or rapidly growing, causes excessive bleeding or discomfort, or seems to be breaking down. Hysterectomy may also be performed after cesarean section—delivery of an infant through the abdominal wall—if there are such complications as uncontrolled bleeding, gross infection, or cancer of the cervix.
