Epinephrine tolerance test,  assessment of the metabolism of liver glycogen by measuring the blood-sugar response to a standard dose of epinephrine (adrenalin). Epinephrine normally accelerates the conversion of liver glycogen (the conjugated, storage form of glucose) to blood glucose, and a blood-glucose rise of 40â€“60 mg per 100 ml of blood may be observed within one hour after a subcutaneous injection of epinephrine (usually 0.01 mg per kg [2.2 lb] of body weight), in subjects that have received a high-carbohydrate diet for three days before the test. Individuals with liver disease or with an inherited deficiency of the enzymes that degrade glycogen to glucose show a subnormal response. A modification of the test involves the substitution of a test dose of glucagon for epinephrine (glucagon tolerance test).
