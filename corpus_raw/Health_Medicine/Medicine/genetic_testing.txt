Genetic testing,  any of a group of procedures used to identify gene variations associated with health, disease, and ancestry and to diagnose inherited diseases and disorders. A genetic test is typically issued only after a medical history, a physical examination, and the construction of a family pedigree documenting the genetic diseases present in the past three generations have been considered. The pedigree is especially important, since it aids in determining whether a disease or disorder is inherited and likely to be passed on to subsequent generations. Genetic testing is increasingly being used in genealogy, the study of family origins and history.
A genetic disorder can occur in a child with parents who are not affected by the disorder. This situation arises when a gene mutation occurs in the egg or sperm (germinal mutation) or following conception, when chromosomes from the egg and sperm combine. Mutations can occur spontaneously or be stimulated by environmental factors, such as radiation or carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). Mutations occur with increasing frequency as people age. In men this may result from errors that occur throughout a lifetime as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) replicates to produce sperm. In women nondisjunction of chromosomes becomes more common later in life, increasing the risk of aneuploidy (too many or too few chromosomes). Long-term exposure to ambient ionizing radiation may cause genetic mutations in either gender. In addition to these exposure mutations, there also exist two broad classes of genes that are prone to mutations that give rise to cancer. These classes include oncogenes, which promote tumour growth, and tumour-suppressor genes, which suppress tumour growth.
Chemical, radiological, histopathologic, and electrodiagnostic procedures can diagnose basic defects in patients suspected of genetic disease. Genetic tests may involve cytogenetic analyses to investigate chromosomes, molecular assays to investigate genes and DNA, or biochemical assays to investigate enzymes, hormones, or amino acids. Tests such as amino acid chromatography of blood and urine, in which the amino acids present in these fluids are separated on the basis of certain chemical affinities, can be used to identify specific hereditary or acquired gene defects. There also exist numerous genetic tests for blood and blood typing and antibody determination. These tests are used to isolate blood or antibody abnormalities that can be traced to genes involved in the generation of these substances. Various electrodiagnostic procedures such as electromyography are useful for identifying defects in muscle and nerve function, which often result from inherited gene mutations.
Prenatal screening is performed if there is a family history of inherited disease, the mother is at an advanced age, a previous child had a chromosomal abnormality, or there is an ethnic indication of risk. Parents can be tested before or after conception to determine whether they are carriers.
A common prenatal test involves screening for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in maternal serum. Elevated levels of AFP are associated with neural tube defects in the fetus, including spina bifida (defective closure of the spine) and anencephaly (absence of brain tissue). When AFP levels are elevated, a more specific diagnosis is attempted, using ultrasound and amniocentesis to analyze the amniotic fluid for the presence of AFP. Fetal cells contained in the amniotic fluid also can be cultured and the karyotype (chromosome morphology) determined to identify chromosomal abnormality. Cells for chromosome analysis also can be obtained by chorionic villus sampling, the direct needle aspiration of cells from the chorionic villus (future placenta).
Women who have had repeated in vitro fertilization failures may undergo preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). PGD is used to detect the presence of embryonic genetic abnormalities that have a high likelihood of causing implantation failure or miscarriage. In PGD a single cell is extracted from the embryo and is analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), a technique used to identify structural abnormalities in chromosomes that standard tests such as karyotyping cannot detect. In some cases DNA is isolated from the cell and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of gene mutations that can give rise to certain disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease. Another technique, known as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), may be used alongside PGD to identify chromosomal abnormalities.
Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled scientists to reconstruct the human fetal genome from genetic material found in maternal blood and paternal saliva. This in turn has raised the possibility for development of prenatal diagnostic tests that are noninvasive to the fetus but capable of accurately detecting genetic defects in fetal DNA. Such tests are desirable because they would significantly reduce the risk of miscarriage that is associated with procedures requiring cell sampling from the fetus or chorionic villus.
Chromosomal karyotyping, in which chromosomes are arranged according to a standard classification scheme, is one of the most commonly used genetic tests. To obtain a personâ€™s karyotype, laboratory technicians grow human cells in tissue culture media. After being stained and sorted, the chromosomes are counted and displayed. The cells are obtained from the blood, skin, or bone marrow or by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, as noted above. The standard karyotype has approximately 400 visible bands, and each band contains up to several hundred genes.
When a chromosomal aberration is identified, it allows for a more accurate prediction of the risk of its recurrence in future offspring. Karyotyping can be used not only to diagnose aneuploidy, which is responsible for Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome, but also to identify the chromosomal aberrations associated with solid tumours such as nephroblastoma, meningioma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, renal-cell carcinoma, small-cell lung cancer, and certain leukemias and lymphomas.
Karyotyping requires a great deal of time and effort and may not always provide conclusive information. It is most useful in identifying very large defects involving hundreds or even thousands of genes.
