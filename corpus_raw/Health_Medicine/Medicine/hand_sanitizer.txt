Hand sanitizer, also called hand antiseptic, handrub, or hand rub,  agent applied to the hands for the purpose of removing common pathogens (disease-causing organisms).1,2 Hand sanitizers typically come in foam, gel, or liquid form.1,3 Their use is recommended when soap and water are not available for hand washing or when repeated hand washing compromises the natural skin barrier (e.g., causing scaling or fissures to develop in the skin).2,3,4 Although the effectiveness of hand sanitizer is variable, it is employed as a simple means of infection control in a wide variety of settings, from day-care centres and schools to hospitals and health care clinics and from supermarkets to cruise ships.1,5
Depending on the active ingredient used, hand sanitizers can be classified as one of two types: alcohol-based or alcohol-free. Alcohol-based products typically contain between 60 and 95 percent alcohol, usually in the form of ethanol, isopropanol, or n-propanol.1,6 At those concentrations, alcohol immediately denatures proteins, effectively neutralizing certain types of microorganisms.2,4,6 Alcohol-free products are generally based on disinfectants, such as benzalkonium chloride (BAC), or on antimicrobial agents, such as triclosan.1,6,7 The activity of disinfectants and antimicrobial agents is both immediate and persistent.1,3,8 Many hand sanitizers also contain emollients (e.g., glycerin) that soothe the skin, thickening agents, and  fragrance.1,3
The effectiveness of hand sanitizer depends on multiple factors, including the manner in which the product is applied (e.g., quantity used, duration of exposure, frequency of use) and whether the specific infectious agents present on the person’s hands are susceptible to the active ingredient in the product.1,3,5 In general, alcohol-based hand sanitizers, if rubbed thoroughly over finger and hand surfaces for a period of 30 seconds, followed by complete air-drying, can effectively reduce populations of bacteria, fungi, and some enveloped viruses (e.g., influenza A viruses).1,6,9 Similar effects have been reported for certain alcohol-free formulations, such as SAB (surfactant, allantoin, and BAC) hand sanitizer.1,3,8 Most hand sanitizers, however, are relatively ineffective against bacterial spores, nonenveloped viruses (e.g., norovirus), and encysted parasites (e.g., Giardia). They also do not fully cleanse or sanitize the skin when hands are noticeably soiled prior to application.1,2
Despite the variability in effectiveness, hand sanitizers can help control the transmission of infectious diseases, especially in settings where compliance with hand washing is poor. For example, among children in elementary schools, the incorporation of either an alcohol-based or an alcohol-free hand sanitizer into classroom hand-hygiene programs has been associated with reductions in absenteeism related to infectious illness.10,11 Likewise, in the workplace, the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer has been associated with reductions in illness episodes and sick days.12 In hospitals and health care clinics, increased access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer has been linked to overall improvements in hand hygiene.13,14
Agencies such as the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention promote the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers over alcohol-free products.2,15,16 Indeed, the use of alcohol-free products has remained limited, in part because of WHO’s and CDC’s focus on alcohol-based products but also because of concerns about the safety of chemicals used in alcohol-free products. Research has indicated that certain antimicrobial compounds, such as triclosan, for example, may interfere with the function of the endocrine system.17 Environmental contamination from triclosan is another concern.18 Disinfectants and antimicrobials also can potentially contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance.1,7,15 In 2014, mounting concerns over triclosan led authorities in the European Union (EU) to restrict the chemical’s use in various consumer products in the EU.19
By comparison, concerns over the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer have centred primarily on product flammability and ingestion, both unintentional (e.g., by young children) and intentional (by individuals seeking to abuse alcohol).6,20,21 With proper storage and strategies that limit access to alcohol-containing sanitizer (e.g., issuing hand sanitizer to individuals), the risk of fire or poisoning from accidental or intentional ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizers is considered to be low.20,21
