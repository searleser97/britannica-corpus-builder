Melarsoprol,  antiprotozoal drug formerly used in the treatment of late-stage African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Melarsoprol is an organoarsenic compound that was discovered in 1949. Its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier made it particularly effective against late-stage Gambian (or West African) sleeping sickness, which is characterized by entry of the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei gambiense into the central nervous system. Melarsoprol was also used effectively against late-stage Rhodesian (or East African) sleeping sickness, caused by T. brucei rhodesiense. Though melarsoprol’s mechanism of action was never entirely understood, scientists suspected that the drug killed trypanosomes by inhibiting a fundamental pathway of energy metabolism.
Melarsoprol was extremely toxic to humans, causing life-threatening encephalopathy (diffuse brain disease) in about 5–10 percent of patients treated with the drug. In the early 2000s it was found that melarsoprol-resistant trypanosomes accounted for treatment failure in nearly 20 percent of patients in central Africa. Shortly thereafter melarsoprol was supplanted by eflornithine in the treatment of late-stage Gambian sleeping sickness.
