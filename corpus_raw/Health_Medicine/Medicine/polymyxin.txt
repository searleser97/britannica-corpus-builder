Polymyxin,  any of five polypeptide antibiotics derived from various species of soil bacterium in the genus Bacillus that are active against gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polymyxins disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria, destroying their ability to function as osmotic barriers.
Only polymyxins B and E are used clinically. Their chief therapeutic use is in the treatment of infections involving gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to penicillin and other broad-spectrum antibiotics. Polymyxin B is applied topically to treat infections such as those of the eye, the ear, the skin, and the urinary bladder. Polymyxin E, also known as colistin, is used frequently for diarrhea in children. Polymyxins are sometimes administered by intramuscular injection.
Because polymyxins also react with the membranes of human cells, they can cause kidney damage and neurotoxicity. The availability of better antibiotics limits the use of polymixins.
