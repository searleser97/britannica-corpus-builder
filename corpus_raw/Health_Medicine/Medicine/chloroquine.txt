Chloroquine,  synthetic drug used in the treatment of malaria. Chloroquine, discovered in 1934 and introduced into medicine in the 1940s, is a member of an important series of chemically related antimalarial agents, the quinoline derivatives. Chloroquine is administered orally as chloroquine phosphate. It also can be given by intramuscular injection as chloroquine hydrochloride. Chloroquine is effective against susceptible strains of the malarial parasites Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, and P. falciparum as well as certain parasitic worms and amoebas. It is also used in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.
Side effects can occur with chloroquine use. Examples of mild side effects include headache and abdominal cramps, which are common to antimalarials. Persons taking chloroquine sometimes also experience skin rash, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and changes in behaviour. Visual impairment, in the form of retinal damage, may occur with long-term use of chloroquine; this condition is known as chloroquine retinopathy.
Chloroquine interacts with a number of other medications, including antacids, certain types of antibiotics—e.g., ampicillin and erythromycin—and antiarrhythmics (drugs used to treat defects in heart rhythms). Drug-drug interactions can alter chloroquine levels in the body, such as by blocking chloroquine metabolism, resulting in toxic chloroquine accumulation in the body. Alternatively, chloroquine can alter levels of other drugs, increasing the risk of side effects and toxicity caused by those agents.
Chloroquine is closely related to hydroxychloroquine, another type of quinoline derivative. Hydroxychloroquine is also used in the treatment of malaria and inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Hydroxychloroquine has many of the same side effects as chloroquine, including an elevated risk of retinopathy, but generally is considered to be less toxic.
