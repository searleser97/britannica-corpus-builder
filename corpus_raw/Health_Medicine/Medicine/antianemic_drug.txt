Antianemic drug,  any drug that increases the number of red blood cells or the amount of hemoglobin (an oxygen-carrying protein) in the blood, deficiencies of which characterize the disorder known as anemia. The red cell and hemoglobin reductions associated with anemia result in tissue oxygen deficiencies that can lead to symptoms such as fainting, dizziness, and shortness of breath.
There are different types of anemia, and thus there exists a variety of antianemic agents. Iron salts, such as ferrous sulfate, are used to treat iron-deficiency anemia, which occurs when the body is deficient in iron, an essential component of hemoglobin. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are used to treat folic acid deficiency anemia and pernicious anemia, which occur because of a lack of these vitamins. Folic acid and vitamin B12 are necessary for red blood cell formation.
