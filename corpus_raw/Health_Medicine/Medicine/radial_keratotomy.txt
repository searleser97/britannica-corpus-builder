Radial keratotomy (RK),  a surgical procedure to correct nearsightedness (myopia). The technique was first developed by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Nikolay Fyodorov in the 1970s. In the 1980s and early 1990s, RK was a widespread procedure for correcting nearsightedness, with several hundred thousand procedures performed worldwide. It has since been replaced by laser-based refractive surgeries, such as photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), that offer improved image quality and outcome predictability.
The cornea, the clear membrane on the front of the eye, contributes approximately 66 percent of the focusing power of the eye. In cases of nearsightedness the focusing ability of the cornea is too strong, resulting in blurred vision. RK reduces this focusing power by surgically flattening the corneal curvature, resulting in sharper vision.
In the RK procedure the surgeon makes a series of incisions in the cornea in a spokelike pattern. The incision depth is approximately 90 percent of the corneal thickness. A central “hub” is left uncut in the cornea. The RK incisions emanate radially outward from this hub. The incisions weaken the cornea’s mechanical strength, resulting in a flattened shape and reduced refractive power. Modulating the size of the hub and the number of incisions controls the amount of corneal flattening. Side effects of RK include progressive corneal flattening leading to farsightedness (hyperopia) and starburst patterns attributed to diffraction from the surgical scars encroaching on the eye’s pupil.
