Oxazolidinone,  class of synthetic antibiotics defined chemically by a heterocyclic ring structure that contains one oxygen atom, one nitrogen atom, and three carbon atoms. Oxazolidinones inhibit bacterial growth by blocking the organismsâ€™ ability to synthesize proteins. Linezolid is highly active against infections caused by many common gram-positive pathogens (disease-causing agents), including Enterococcus bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin. Linezolid may be administered orally or intravenously. One major side effect is an increase in blood pressure.
