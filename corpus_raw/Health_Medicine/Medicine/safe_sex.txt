Safe sex,  practices that reduce the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, especially AIDS, during sexual intercourse and similar activities. The term usually refers to use of condoms, which greatly reduce the chance of infection but are not 100 percent effective. Abstinence and staying monogamous with an uninfected and monogamous partner are completely safe.
