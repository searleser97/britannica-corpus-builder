Pap smear, also called Papanicolaou smear,  laboratory method of obtaining secretions from the cervix for the examination of cast-off epithelial cells to detect the presence of cancer. The Pap smear, named for Greek-born American physician George Papanicolaou, is notably reliable in detecting the early stages of cancer in the uterine cervix. Two specimens are usually taken for laboratory staining and examination, one consisting of vaginal secretions and the other of scrapings of the surface of the cervix at the site where cancerous growth frequently originates. The Pap smear may reveal malignant cells not only from the cervix but also from the endometrium (the mucous coat of the uterus) and the ovaries. The traditional Pap smear, in which cells are literally smeared directly onto a glass slide, is now less common than the Pap test, in which the cells are first placed in a liquid medium before processing. The latter method has the advantage of allowing the laboratory technician to centrifuge the cells and to filter blood, mucus, and debris that can make slide interpretation difficult.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a biennial Pap test for all women once they have reached age 21. The frequency of Pap tests may be reduced if a woman has had multiple consecutive tests prove negative. For example, women age 30 and older who have had negative results may require a Pap test only once every three years.
