Council on Health Research for Development (COHRED),  international nongovernmental organization (NGO) created in 1993 to improve public health primarily in developing countries. The Council on Health Research for Development helps countries strengthen their health research infrastructure and devise effective public health policies.
COHRED’s activities include working with international health agencies and commissions to develop more effective partnerships between those organizations and the countries that COHRED targets. The group organizes global conferences, such as the Bamako Ministerial Forum held in Mali in 2008, and provides consulting, technical expertise, and other services. It regularly publishes technical reports, journal articles, and manuals and guides.
COHRED is managed by a group of international academics and experts in public health policy, along with a board of directors. Calling itself a “Southern Alliance with key Northern partners,” the group receives funding from a variety of donors, including the European Commission, the International Development Research Centre in Canada, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.
