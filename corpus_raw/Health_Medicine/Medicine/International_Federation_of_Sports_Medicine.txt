International Federation of Sports Medicine (FIMS), (French: Fédération Internationale de Médecine du Sport)  confederation primarily comprising national sports medicine associations from across the globe. The organization also includes continental associations, regional associations, and various individual members. It is the oldest and largest such confederation in the world.
The organization was founded on February 14, 1928, during the Olympic Winter Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland, as the Association Internationale Médico-Sportive (AIMS). The first International AIMS Congress took place later that year, during the Olympic Summer Games in Amsterdam. The name of the organization changed periodically through the years; the name Fédération Internationale de Médecine Sport (FIMS) was decided in 1998 at the 26th World Congress in Orlando, Florida.
FIMS has several objectives. The group’s goals include advancing the worldwide study and development of sports medicine, researching the various effects of physical training and sports participation, spreading education and awareness of sports medicine by organizing or supporting scientific meetings, classes, and congresses related to the topic, and encouraging physical training and sports participation. In addition, FIMS publishes scientific information on sports medicine, including the International SportMed Journal. FIMS also cooperates with national and international organizations in sports medicine and related fields. To that end, FIMS works closely with two affiliated organizations, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and SportAccord (an international sports federation union). FIMS is also affiliated with the International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education (ICSSPE), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
