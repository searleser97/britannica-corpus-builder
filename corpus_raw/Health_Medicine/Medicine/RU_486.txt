RU-486,  first trade name for mifepristone, a synthetic steroid drug prescribed for inducing abortion during the early weeks of pregnancy. The name is derived from an abbreviation for the pharmaceutical company Roussel-Uclaf plus a serial number. RU-486 was approved for use in France in 1988, and almost immediately it became the object of ardent opposition by right-to-life groups and equally ardent advocacy by abortion-rights groups. Both sides understood that the “abortion pill,” as RU-486 was quickly dubbed, would change the dynamics of abortion, making it possible for women to terminate early pregnancies with relative ease and privacy, few medical complications, and in most cases no need for intrusive surgical procedures. In 1995 executives of Roussel-Uclaf formed the company Exelgyn, which was awarded patent rights to the drug. It was approved for use in the United Kingdom in 1991 and Germany in 1999 under the trade name Mifegyne and in the United States in 2000 under the trade name Mifeprex. See also mifepristone.
