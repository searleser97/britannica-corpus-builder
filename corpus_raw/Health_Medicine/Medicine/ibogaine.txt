Ibogaine,  hallucinogenic drug and the principal iboga alkaloid, found in the stems, leaves, and especially in the roots of the African shrub Tabernanthe iboga. Ibogaine was isolated from the plant in 1901 and was synthesized in 1966. In small doses it acts as a stimulant. The peoples of West Africa and the Congo region have used iboga extracts or chewed the root of the plant in order to remain calm but alert while stalking game.
Chemically, ibogaine is an indole hallucinogen that can block the action of serotonin (the indole amine transmitter of nerve impulses) in brain tissue. Ibogaine occurs as a crystalline solid and is soluble in alcohol and other organic solvents. Ibogaine hydrochloride is a crystalline salt, soluble in alcohol and in water. It was proposed for medical use as an antidepressant, but it was rejected in favour of more practical and less toxic drugs.
