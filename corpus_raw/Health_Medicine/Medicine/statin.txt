statin, also called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor,  drug that acts to lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA (5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase, which is required for cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins include simvastatin, pravastatin, and lovastatin. Statins are generally quite safe, but side effects may include muscle pain and fatigue. A rare side effect called myopathy, characterized by muscle degeneration, has been associated with a mutation in a gene involved in mediating liver uptake of statins.
Statins have shown promise as antihypertensive drugs because of their ability to lower both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The mechanism by which statins act to reduce blood pressure is unknown; however, scientists suspect that these drugs activate substances involved in vasodilation (relaxation of blood vessels). Statins also appear to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques (deposits of fat in artery walls) and thus may be prescribed to reduce the chances of thrombosis, in which a blood clot forms at the site of the plaque, potentially blocking the flow of blood; they may also counter pulmonary embolism, in which the plaque of fat or the blood clot dislodges and becomes stuck in a vessel in the heart, leading to chest pain, difficulty breathing, and in some cases sudden death. Likewise, there is evidence that statins can reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism, which is caused by a blood clot that breaks loose from within a vein and becomes caught in another vessel.
