Isoniazid, also called isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH),  drug used in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis. Isoniazid commonly is used in combination with other drugs, such as rifampin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, or streptomycin; these drugs are used with isoniazid in order to prevent, or at least delay, the development of isoniazid-resistant strains of tuberculin bacilli. Treatment usually is continued for many months. The most important drug in the therapy of tuberculosis, isoniazid was introduced into medicine in 1952; it usually is administered orally, but it can be given by injection. Side effects may include hepatitis (especially in older patients), peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, and headache.
