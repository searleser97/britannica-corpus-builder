Immunologic blood test,  any of a group of diagnostic analyses of blood that employ antigens (foreign proteins) and antibodies (immunoglobulins) to detect abnormalities of the immune system. Immunity to disease depends on the body’s ability to produce antibodies when challenged by antigens. Antibodies bind to and help eliminate antigens from the body.
The inability of the body to produce certain classes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, IgE) can lead to disease. Complexes formed by the antigen-antibody reaction can be deposited in almost any tissue and can lead to malfunction of that organ. Immunofluorescence assays to detect antinuclear antibodies (antibodies that will bind to antigens within the nucleus) can be used to diagnose conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Assays to detect specific IgG and IgM complexes known as rheumatoid factors can help confirm the diagnosis of certain conditions, including Sjögren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic hepatitis.
The inability of the body to develop antibodies to invading bacteria may result from infection with HIV, which invades white blood cells—primarily monocytes, macrophages, and helper T lymphocytes. Helper T cells are a subgroup of T lymphocytes that are the primary regulators of the immune response and proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation. Testing for HIV is performed with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a western immunoblotting antibody test (western blot).
