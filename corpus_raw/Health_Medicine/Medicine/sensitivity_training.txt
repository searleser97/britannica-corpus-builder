Sensitivity training,   psychological technique in which intensive group discussion and interaction are used to increase individual awareness of self and others; it is practiced in a variety of forms under such names as T-group, encounter group, human relations, and group-dynamics training. The group is usually small and unstructured and chooses its own goals. A trained leader is generally present to help maintain a psychologically safe atmosphere in which participants feel free to express themselves and experiment with new ways of dealing with others. The leader remains as much as possible outside the discussion. Issues are raised by the group members, and their interactions evoke a wide variety of feelings. The leader encourages participants to examine verbally their own and othersâ€™ reactions. It is believed that as mutual trust is developed, interpersonal communication increases, and eventually attitudes will change and be carried over into relations outside the group. Often, however, these changes do not endure. Sensitivity training seems to be most effective if sessions are concentrated and uninterrupted, as in several days of continuous meetings.
Sensitivity-training methods derived in large part from those of group psychotherapy. They have been applied to a wide range of social problems (as in business and industry) in an effort to enhance trust and communication among individuals and groups throughout an organization.
