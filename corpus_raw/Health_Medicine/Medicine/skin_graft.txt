Skin graft,   transplantation of healthy skin from one area of the body to cover and heal a large wound or burn in another area of a similar skin type. The two most widely used techniques are (1) split-thickness grafts, which remove the upper layer (epidermis) and part of the middle layer (dermis) of the skin, allowing the donor site to heal naturally, and (2) full-thickness grafts, which transfer the entire dermis so that the donor site must be surgically closed. An earlier technique, pinch grafting, which used many small grafts instead of one large one, has been abandoned for the most part because of unsightly scarring at the donor site. The most common sites employed as sources for skin grafts are the inner thigh, leg, upper arm, and forearm.
