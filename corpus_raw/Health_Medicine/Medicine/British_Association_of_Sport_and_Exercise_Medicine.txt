British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine (BASEM), formerly British Association of Sport and Medicine (BASM),  organization founded in 1953 by a group of doctors, sports scientists, and those from allied disciplines who were involved in the care of athletes. The group’s main objectives include representing doctors working in the sport and exercise medicine (SEM) field and providing guidance and educational enrichment to health care professionals who work with professional athletes as well as other individuals who engage in physical activity.
From its inception, the organization helped promote the study of SEM by various methods. One example is the British Journal of Sports Medicine (originally Bulletin—British Association of Sport and Medicine), the publication introduced by the organization in the 1960s to share and promote research and debate. The journal serves not only BASEM but also several other sports medicine-related organizations. Another example is the campaign by BASEM for professional recognition of SEM in the United Kingdom, which achieved a notable success in 2005 with the formation of a Faculty of Sport and Exercise Medicine under the auspices of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. It marked the first time the SEM field was fully recognized as a medical specialty in the United Kingdom. BASEM also provides training courses for current and aspiring SEM doctors as well as other health care professionals,
 and it organizes regular conferences.
