Macrobiotics,  dietary practice based on the Chinese philosophy of balancing yin and yang (see yinyang). It stresses avoiding foods that are classified as strongly yin (e.g., alcoholic beverages) or yang (e.g., meat) and relying mainly on near-neutral foods such as grains. In addition, foods that grow naturally in one’s climate should be the mainstay of one’s diet. Macrobiotics was first articulated in Asia in the 1930s and swept Europe and the U.S. in the late 1960s. Adherents maintain that not only can the quality of life be enhanced but that serious ailments such as cancer can be healed; critics counter that uninformed attempts to practice such a diet can lead to malnutrition.
