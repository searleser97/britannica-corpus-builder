Aptitude test,  examination that attempts to determine and measure a personâ€™s ability to acquire, through future training, some specific set of skills (intellectual, motor, and so on). The tests assume that people differ in their special abilities and that these differences can be useful in predicting future achievements.
General, or multiple, aptitude tests are similar to intelligence tests in that they measure a broad spectrum of abilities (e.g., verbal comprehension, general reasoning, numerical operations, perceptual speed, or mechanical knowledge). The Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the American College Testing Exam (ACT) are examples of group tests commonly used in the United States to gauge general academic ability; in France the International Baccalaureate exam (le bac) is taken by  secondary-school students. Such tests yield a profile of scores rather than a single IQ and are widely used in educational and vocational counseling. Aptitude tests also have been developed to measure professional potential (e.g., legal or medical) and special abilities (e.g., clerical or mechanical). The Differential Aptitude Test (DAT) measures specific abilities such as clerical speed and mechanical reasoning as well as general academic ability.
