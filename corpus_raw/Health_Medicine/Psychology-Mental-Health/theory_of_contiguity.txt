Theory of contiguity,  psychological theory of learning which emphasizes that the only condition necessary for the association of stimuli and responses is that there be a close temporal relationship between them. It holds that learning will occur regardless of whether reinforcement is given, so long as the conditioned stimulus and the response occur together. Psychologists John Watson and E.R. Guthrie were both proponents of the theory of contiguity.
