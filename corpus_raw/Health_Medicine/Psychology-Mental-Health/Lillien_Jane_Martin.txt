Lillien Jane Martin, byname Lillie,  (born July 7, 1851, Olean, N.Y., U.S.—died March 26, 1943, San Francisco, Calif.),  American psychologist who followed up her academic career with an active second career in gerontological psychology.
Martin was a precocious child and entered Olean Academy at the age of four. At age 16 she began teaching in a girls’ school in Wisconsin, and by 1876 she had saved enough money to enter Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York, from which she graduated in 1880. She then taught high-school physics and chemistry in Indianapolis, Indiana (1880–89), and was vice-principal and head of the science department of the Girls’ High School in San Francisco (1889–94).
In 1894 Martin traveled to Germany to enter the University of Göttingen, where she studied psychology and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1898. The following year she was named assistant professor of psychology at Stanford (California) University. She continued her studies in Germany in summers, working in the Universities of Würzburg (1907), Bonn (1908 and 1912), and Munich (1914). Her scholarly publications of that period, nearly all in German, deal with problems in hypnotism, aesthetics, personality, abnormal psychology, and the nature of thought. At Stanford she gradually advanced to full professor (1911), and in 1915 she became the first woman to head a department at the university. She was given mandatory retirement at the age of 65 the following year. Martin then moved to San Francisco and established herself as a consulting psychologist. She established mental health clinics in the Polyclinic and Mount Zion hospitals and carried on a private practice.
In 1929, as a result of her experience with a child whose problem was actually an overbearing grandmother, Martin established the Old Age Counseling Center, the first such clinic in the world. The rest of her career was devoted to gerontological research and clinical counseling and rehabilitation. Her success in that field derived in large part from the example she herself set: an indefatigable traveler, she journeyed alone to Russia at age 78, made a coast-to-coast automobile tour at 81 (just three years after she had learned to drive), and traveled through the jungles and mountains of South America for six months at 87.
Martin’s later publications include Personality as Revealed by the Content of Images (1917), Mental Training for the Pre-School Age Child (1923; with Clare De Gruchy), Round the World with a Psychologist (1927), Sweeping the Cobwebs (1933; with De Gruchy), and Handbook for Old Age Counsellors (1944).
