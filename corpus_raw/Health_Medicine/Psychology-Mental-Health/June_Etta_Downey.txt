June Etta Downey,  (born July 13, 1875, Laramie, Wyo., U.S.—died Oct. 11, 1932, Trenton, N.J.),  American psychologist and educator whose studies centred on the psychology of aesthetics and related philosophical issues.
Downey graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1895. After a year of teaching school in Laramie, she resumed her education at the University of Chicago, where in 1898 she took a master’s degree in philosophy and psychology. In that year she joined the faculty of the University of Wyoming as an instructor of English, and the next year she became an instructor of philosophy as well. In the summer of 1901 she studied psychology under Edward Bradford Titchener at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. She became a full professor in 1905.
In 1904 Downey published a volume of poems titled Heavenly Dykes. After a sabbatical year of further study at the University of Chicago, she was awarded her Ph.D. in 1908, and on her return to the University of Wyoming she became head of her department. She soon gave up the teaching of English to concentrate on philosophy and psychology, and the title of her professorship was changed formally to philosophy and psychology in 1915. A gifted and often ingenious experimenter, Downey followed her principal interest in the psychology of aesthetics into many areas of the arts and the mental processes associated with them. Work in muscle reading, handwriting, handedness, colour perception, and such topics led to deeper investigations into personality and creativity. Her work resulted in more than 60 articles in professional journals and several books, including Graphology and the Psychology of Handwriting (1919); Plots and Personalities (1922; with Edward E. Slosson); The Will-Temperament and Its Testing (1923), a report on her attempt to clinically test aspects of personality other than intelligence; and Creative Imagination: Studies in the Psychology of Literature (1929).
