Inhibition,   in psychology, conscious or unconscious constraint or curtailment of a process or behaviour, especially of impulses or desires. Inhibition serves necessary social functions, abating or preventing certain impulses from being acted on (e.g., the desire to hit someone in the heat of anger) and enabling the delay of gratification from pleasurable activities. Conscious inhibition is a common occurrence in daily life and is present whenever two conflicting desires are experienced (e.g., the desire to eat a rich dessert versus the desire to lose weight).
Psychoanalytic theory views inhibition as a largely unconscious mechanism that mediates between the superego (the conscience) and the id (primitive desires). Taboos, such as those against incest or murder, are those socially imposed inhibitions which are raised to the level of unwritten laws.
An extreme lack of inhibition may be antisocial and a symptom of certain mental disorders, particularly behaviour disorders, sociopathic personality disorders, and schizophrenic disorders. Conversely, too much inhibition can be personally destructive, resulting in the neurotic inability to feel or express certain emotions, or in sexual frigidity or impotence.
The ingestion of alcohol and certain drugs, particularly sedative-tranquilizers (e.g., chlordiazepoxide and diazepam), hypnotics (e.g., flurazepam), and certain narcotics, may reduce inhibitions. The effects will vary from person to person.
Inhibition also plays an important role in conditioning and learning, because an organism must learn to restrain certain instinctual behaviours or previously learned patterns in order to master new patterns.
In physiological psychology, the term inhibition refers to the suppression of neural electrical activity.
