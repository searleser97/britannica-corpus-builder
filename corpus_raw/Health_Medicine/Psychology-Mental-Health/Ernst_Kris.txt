Ernst Kris,  (born April 26, 1900, Vienna—died  Feb. 27, 1957, New York City), psychologist and historian of art, known for his psychoanalytic studies of artistic creation and for combining psychoanalysis and direct observation of infants in child psychology.
Kris received his doctorate in art history from the University of Vienna in 1922 and was appointed an assistant curator at the Vienna Kunsthistoriches museum, soon gaining a reputation as a leading authority on gems, intaglios, and goldwork. In 1924 he was asked by Sigmund Freud to assist with Freud’s collection of cameos and intaglios. He continued his work at the museum while undergoing training in psychoanalysis until 1933. He was asked by Freud in 1933 to co-edit, with Robert Waelder, the journal Imago. He was also one of the editors of the German edition of Freud’s writings (1924–34). In 1936 he published a paper relating art to psychology, arguing that the difference between the artist and the psychotic is that the artist can return from the world of his imagination to the real world, while the psychotic cannot.
Kris left Vienna in 1938, going first to England, where he worked for the British government analyzing German broadcasts; then to Canada; and finally, in 1940, to the United States, where he joined the New School for Social Research. He had become interested in the genetic sources of human behaviour and so began to work particularly with children; in 1945 he helped found the journal The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child. In 1950 he began an interdisciplinary study of child development with Milton Senn at Yale University, establishing the combination of direct observation with psychoanalytic methods as a research tool in child psychology. He studied variations in maternal attitudes towards children and the fate of childhood memories in adult psychoanalysis, but his work was incomplete at his death.
