Abstraction,  the cognitive process of isolating, or “abstracting,” a common feature or relationship observed in a number of things, or the product of such a process. The property of electrical conductivity, for example, is abstracted from observations of bodies that allow electricity to flow through them; similarly, observations of pairs of lines in which one line is longer than the other can yield the relation of “being longer than.”
What is abstracted—i.e., the abstraction or abstractum—is sometimes taken to be a concept (or “abstract idea”) rather than a property or relation. Which view is taken on this issue depends in part on the view one holds on the general issue of universals (entities used to explain what it is for individual things to share a feature, attribute, or quality or to fall under the same type or natural kind).
Abstract as an adjective is contrasted with concrete in that, whereas the latter refers to a particular thing, the former refers to a kind, or general character, under which the particular thing—i.e., the “instance”—falls. Thus, war is abstract, but World War I is concrete; circularity is abstract, but coins, dinner plates, and other particular circular objects are concrete. The term abstract is sometimes used to refer to things that are not located in space or time; in this sense, numbers, properties, sets, propositions, and even facts can be said to be abstract, whereas individual physical objects and events are concrete. The capacity for making and employing abstractions is considered to be essential to higher cognitive functions, such as forming judgments, learning from experience, and making inferences.
