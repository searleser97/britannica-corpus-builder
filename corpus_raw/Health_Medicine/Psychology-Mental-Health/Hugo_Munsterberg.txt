Hugo Münsterberg,  (born June 1, 1863, Danzig, Prussia [now Gdańsk, Poland]—died  Dec. 16, 1916, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.), German-American psychologist and philosopher who was interested in the applications of psychology to law, business, industry, medicine, teaching, and sociology.
Münsterberg took his Ph.D. in 1885 and his M.D. at the University of Heidelberg in 1887. After his appointment as an instructor at the University of Freiburg, where he established a psychological laboratory, he began publishing Beiträge zur experimentellen Psychologie (1889–92; “Contributions to Experimental Psychology”). His work was criticized by German colleagues but won the approval of the American psychologist William James, who invited him to be a visiting professor at Harvard University (1892–95). Münsterberg returned to the United States permanently in 1897 to direct the Harvard psychological laboratory, and he became increasingly absorbed with the application of psychology to a number of different areas, including psychic research. He is sometimes credited with being the founder of applied psychology. His works include Psychology and the Teacher (1909), Psychology and Industrial Efficiency (1913), and Psychology: General and Applied (1914).
