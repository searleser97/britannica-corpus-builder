The Hite Report, in full The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality,  publication by feminist Shere Hite in 1976 that, while flawed in its handling of statistics, challenged numerous accepted notions about female sexuality.
The 478-page book contains the self-reported results of about 3,000 of 100,000 questionnaires Hite distributed to women ranging in age from 14 to 78. Like other writings on sexuality, such as the Kinsey Report and the work of William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, Hite’s book contained statistical analyses, but the greater part of the book comprised candidly recounted anecdotes, opinions, and complaints relating to the respondents’ sex lives. Reviewers roundly criticized Hite for lax statistical reporting (among other lapses, she failed to obtain demographic statistics from some of her respondents), but the book became an instant best seller. Many women who read the book felt reassured or vindicated by reading other women’s frank opinions about sex. Hite’s final judgment that women were far from satisfied sexually unsettled much established opinion on the subject.
The Hite Report on Male Sexuality (1981) recounted the results of about 7,200 questionnaires completed by men. In 1987 Hite published an update of her first study, The Hite Report on Women and Love: A Cultural Revolution in Progress, the content again culled from questionnaires. That book’s revelation that 98 percent of American women found their sex lives lacking stirred controversy once again and brought Hite renewed notoriety. In The Hite Report on the Family (1994) she argued that the traditional patriarchal family is repressive and that single-parent families can be more beneficial to children.
