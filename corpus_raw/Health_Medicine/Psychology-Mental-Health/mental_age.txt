Mental age,   intelligence test score, expressed as the chronological age for which a given level of performance is average or typical. An individualâ€™s mental age is then divided by his chronological age and multiplied by 100, yielding an intelligence quotient (IQ). Thus, a subject whose mental and chronological ages are identical has an IQ of 100, or average intelligence. However, if a 10-year-old has a mental age of 13, his IQ is 130, well above average. Since the average mental age of adults does not increase past age 18, an adult taking an IQ test is assigned the chronological age of 18.
Mental age was first defined by the French psychologist Alfred Binet, who introduced the intelligence test in 1905. Because the variation in scores for different age groups taking graded tests increases roughly in proportion to the increase in age, mental ages cannot be used accurately to compare the basic ability of children of different chronological ages.
