Edwin G. Boring, in full Edwin Garrigues Boring,  (born October 23, 1886, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died July 1, 1968, Cambridge, Massachusetts), American psychologist first recognized for his experimental work but later known as a historian of psychology.
Boring studied engineering and psychology at Cornell University, receiving his Ph.D. in the latter in 1914. He taught at Clark University and then went to Harvard University (1922), where he became director (1924) of the Psychological Laboratory. From 1957 to 1968 he was professor emeritus of psychology.
Boring’s experimental work focused on sensory stimulation of the alimentary tract and the physiological consequences of dividing nerve fibres. However, his research also covered a vast number of other topics, giving him one of the widest backgrounds of any American psychologist and preparing him to write his best-known work, A History of Experimental Psychology (1929, 2nd ed. 1950), which established him as one of the first historians of the field in the United States. Boring also wrote The Physical Dimensions of Consciousness (1933) and Sensation and Perception in the History of Experimental Psychology (1942).
