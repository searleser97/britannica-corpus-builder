Idée reçue, (French:  “received idea”)  an idea that is unexamined. The phrase is particularly associated with Gustave Flaubert, who in his Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues (published posthumously in 1913; Flaubert’s Dictionary of Accepted Ideas) mocked the use of clichés and platitudes and the uncritical reliance on accepted ideas. Initially begun for his own amusement, the so-called dictionary was compiled with the help of the young philosopher Alfred Le Poittevin. Together they invented a grotesque imaginary character called “le Garçon” (“the Boy”), to whom they attributed whatever sort of remark seemed to them most debased. The work reflects Flaubert’s disdain for the “bourgeois,” by which he meant anyone who “has a low way of thinking.”
