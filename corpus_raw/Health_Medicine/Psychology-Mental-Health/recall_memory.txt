Recall,  in psychology, the act of retrieving information or events from the past while lacking a specific cue to help in retrieving the information. A person employs recall, for example, when reminiscing about a vacation or reciting a poem after hearing its title. Most students would rather take a multiple-choice test, which utilizes recognition memory, than an essay test, which employs recall memory. Retrieval of information is much more likely if individuals are tested in the same physical context in which the event they are trying to recall occurred. If, for example, the physical context at the time of learning differs markedly from the physical setting at the time of an exam, retrieval will be more difficult. Tests of recall have long been a primary method used by experimental psychologists in the study of human memory processes.
