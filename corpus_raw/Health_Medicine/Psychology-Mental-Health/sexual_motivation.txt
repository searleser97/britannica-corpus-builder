Sexual motivation, also called sex drive,  the impulse to gratify sexual needs, either through direct sexual activity or through apparently unrelated activities (sublimation). The term libido was coined by Sigmund Freud and used by him to encompass the seeking of pleasure in general, one of the major motivating forces for human activity. Freud suggested that this drive had a genetic basis as part of the species’ need to continue itself. Unlike other basic drives such as hunger, gratification of the libido can be postponed or transferred without endangering the individual’s existence. Thus, sexual drives are more likely to be sublimated, or channeled into other avenues of gratification, to achieve socially acceptable goals.
Sexual motivation or libido develops throughout most of the individual’s life. Freud identified a series of stages in libido development beginning in infancy, and he suggested that an individual could become fixed in one of these immature stages and not pass on to the mature adult stage of sexuality, in which the chief physical mode of sexual pleasure is genital.
In Freudian psychology, earlier concepts of sexuality were widened to cover all activities from which one derives pleasure. Thus, cultural and intellectual achievements could be seen as the outcome of sublimated sexual drives. As he developed the theory further, Freud saw libido as being in conflict with aggression, and other drives were considered to result from the balance between these two strong motivating forces.
