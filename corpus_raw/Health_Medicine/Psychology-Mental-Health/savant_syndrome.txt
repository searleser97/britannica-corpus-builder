Savant syndrome,  rare condition wherein a person of less than normal intelligence or severely limited emotional range has prodigious intellectual gifts in a specific area. Mathematical, musical, artistic, and mechanical abilities have been among the talents demonstrated by savants. Examples include performing rapid mental calculations of huge sums, playing lengthy musical compositions from memory after a single hearing, and repairing complex mechanisms without training. About 10 percent of autistic people exhibit savant syndrome and are known as autistic savants. Non-autistic intellectually disabled people may also be savants, though the incidence among them is much lower.
