Jauhar,  historically, Indian rite of collective self-immolation, performed by the women, young children, and other dependants of a besieged fort or town when it was felt that holding out against the enemy was no longer possible and that death appeared the only honourable way out of the impasse. The act of jauhar would be followed by the surviving fighting men of the encircled fort charging defiantly onto the battlefield one last time, embracing death in battle as befitting a warrior in an act known as shaka.
The best-known act of jauhar in Indian history occurred in the early 14th century, when the women of Chitor (later Chittaurgarh), led by Rajput Queen Rani Padmini, cast themselves into a fire.
