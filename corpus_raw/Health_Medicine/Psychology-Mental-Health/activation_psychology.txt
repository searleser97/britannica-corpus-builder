Activation, also called arousal,  in psychology, the stimulation of the cerebral cortex into a state of general wakefulness, or attention. Activation proceeds from various portions of the brain, but primarily from the reticular formation, the nerve network in the midbrain that monitors ingoing and outgoing sensory and motor impulses. Activation, however, is not the same as direct cortical stimulation by specific sense receptors, such as being awakened by noise. It involves, rather, a complex of impulses that are both internal and external to the body. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the degree of arousal.
