Folk psychology,  ways of conceptualizing mind and the mental that are implicit in ordinary, everyday attributions of mental states to oneself and others. Philosophers have adopted different positions about the extent to which folk psychology and its generalizations (e.g., those portraying human actions as governed by intention) are supported by the findings of scientific psychology. Some consider it indispensible to understanding human conduct. Others (e.g., “eliminative materialists”) think that it can and perhaps will be replaced by scientific psychology.
