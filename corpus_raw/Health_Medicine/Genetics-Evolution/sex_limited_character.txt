Sex-limited character,  an observable feature appearing only in members of one sex of a given population of organisms, although organisms of both sexes may have the genetic constitution that determines the trait. The genes that control milk yield and quality in dairy cattle, for example, are present in both bulls and cows, but their effects are expressed only in the female cattle. Premature baldness and type of beard growth are human sex-limited characters.
