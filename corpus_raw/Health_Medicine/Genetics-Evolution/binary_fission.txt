Binary fission,  asexual reproduction by a separation of the body into two new bodies. In the process of binary fission, an organism duplicates its genetic material, or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and then divides into two parts (cytokinesis), with each new organism receiving one copy of DNA.
Binary fission is the primary method of reproduction of prokaryotic organisms. In protists, binary fission is often differentiated into types, such as transverse or longitudinal, depending on the axis of cell separation. Regular transverse fission in some organisms, such as tapeworms and scyphostome polyps, is called strobilation. Commonly, this results in a chain, called a strobilus, of the fission productsâ€”the proglottids of tapeworms and the ephyrae of scyphozoan jellyfish; each proglottid or ephyra matures in turn and separates from the end of the strobilus. A few metazoan (multicellular) species regularly undergo a body division into several units simultaneously, a process called fragmentation. Planarian fission and fragmentation generally represent direct reproduction in which each portion regenerates missing parts to become a complete new animal. Strobilation products, however, are only indirectly reproductive: proglottids are not regenerative but carry and release great numbers of eggs and die; ephyrae do not produce new polyps but mature into sexually reproducing medusae, the larvae of which become polyps.
