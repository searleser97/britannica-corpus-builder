Somatic mutation,  genetic alteration acquired by a cell that can be passed to the progeny of the mutated cell in the course of cell division. Somatic mutations differ from germ line mutations, which are inherited genetic alterations that occur in the germ cells (i.e., sperm and eggs). Somatic mutations are frequently caused by environmental factors, such as exposure to ultraviolet radiation or to certain chemicals.
Somatic mutations may occur in any cell division from the first cleavage of the fertilized egg to the cell divisions that replace cells in a senile individual. The mutation affects all cells descended from the mutated cell. A major part of an organism, such as the branch of a tree or a complete tissue layer of an animal, may carry the mutation; it may or may not be expressed visibly. Somatic mutations can give rise to various diseases, including cancer.
