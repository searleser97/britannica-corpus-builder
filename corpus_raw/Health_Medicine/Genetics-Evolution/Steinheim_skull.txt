Steinheim skull,  human fossil remnant found in 1933 along the Murr River about 20 km (12 miles) north of Stuttgart, Germany. Found in association with bones of elephants and rhinoceroses, the specimen has been dated to approximately 350,000 years ago. The skull is characterized by an estimated cranial capacity of 1,100 cc (67 cubic inches), a long, slightly flattened skull, moderately heavy browridges, and a rounded rear portion. It does not deviate from the normal range of variation for these traits in modern man. Steinheim is classified as an archaic Homo sapiens or as H. heidelbergensis.
