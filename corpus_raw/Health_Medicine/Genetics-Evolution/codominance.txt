Codominance,  in genetics, phenomenon in which two alleles (different versions of the same gene) are expressed to an equal degree within an organism. As a result, traits associated with each allele are displayed simultaneously.
An example of codominance is seen in the MN blood group system of humans. MN blood type is governed by two alleles, M and N. Individuals who are homozygous for the M allele have a surface molecule (called the M antigen) on their red blood cells. Similarly, those homozygous for the N allele have the N antigen on their red blood cells. Heterozygotes—those with both alleles—carry both antigens. An example of codominance for a gene with multiple alleles is seen in the human ABO blood group system. Persons with type AB blood have one allele for A and one for B; the O allele is recessive (its expression is masked by the other alleles).
Examples of codominance in animals include speckled chickens, which have alleles for both black and white feathers, and roan cattle, which express alleles for both red hair and white hair. Codominance is also seen in plants. For example, rhododendrons with simultaneous expression of red and white genes for flower colour display flowers with both red and white petals.
