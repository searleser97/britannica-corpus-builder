Clone, also spelled clon,  cell or organism that is genetically identical to the original cell or organism from which it is derived. The word clone originates from the ancient Greek klon, meaning “twig.”
Many unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, are clones of parent cells generated by either binary fission or budding. The body cells of plants and animals are clones ultimately derived from the mitosis (cell reproduction) of a single fertilized egg. More narrowly, a clone can be defined as an individual organism that was grown from a single body cell of its parent and that is genetically identical to it.
Plants that are able to propagate by asexual means produce genetically identical plants that are clones. Clones have been commonplace in horticulture since ancient times; many varieties of plants are cloned simply by obtaining cuttings of their leaves, stems, or roots and replanting them. A vast array of fruit and nut tree varieties and innumerable ornamental plants represent clones.
For information about the generation of clones in biomedical research, see cloning, recombinant DNA technology, somatic cell nuclear transfer, and genetic engineering.
