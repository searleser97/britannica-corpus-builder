Sexual dimorphism,  the differences in appearance between males and females of the same species, such as in colour, shape, size, and structure, that are caused by the inheritance of one or the other sexual pattern in the genetic material.
The differences may be extreme, as in the adaptations for sexual selection seen in the exotic plumes and colours of the male bird-of-paradise (family Paradisaeidae) or in the adaptations for protection exemplified by the great size and huge canine teeth of the male baboon (Papio). Many birds show at least some dimorphism in colour, the female being cryptically coloured to remain concealed on the nest while the more-colourful male uses display in courtship and territorial behaviours. The mountain spiny lizard (Sceloporus jarrovi) is sexually dimorphic in feeding habits: the equal-sized males and females seek out different sizes of prey.
Pronounced size differences may occur between the sexes. For example, male baboons are more than twice as large as females, and male northern, or Steller, sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus) weigh about 1,000 kg (2,200 pounds), roughly three times as much as females.
In a few mammal species, females tend to be larger than males. The same is true of many non-mammalian vertebrates and numerous invertebrates.
