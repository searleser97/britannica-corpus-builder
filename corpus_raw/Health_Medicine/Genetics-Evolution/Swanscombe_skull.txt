Swanscombe skull,  human fossil remnants consisting of three large cranial bones (two parietals and an occipital) of a young female found in well-stratified gravels of the River Thames at Swanscombe in Kent, England. Discovered in 1935, 1936, and 1955, the remains were dated to about 300,000 years ago by chemical tests and by association with animal remains and Acheulean hand axes also found at the site. The Swanscombe skull predates the Neanderthals and is usually classified as an archaic Homo sapiens, also called H. heidelbergensis.
