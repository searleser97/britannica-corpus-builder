Homeotic gene,  any of a group of genes that control the pattern of body formation during early embryonic development of organisms. These genes encode proteins called transcription factors that direct cells to form various parts of the body. A homeotic protein can activate one gene but repress another, producing effects that are complementary and necessary for the ordered development of an organism.
Homeotic genes contain a sequence of DNA known as a homeobox, which encodes a segment of 60 amino acids within the homeotic transcription factor protein. If a mutation occurs in the homeobox of any of the homeotic genes, an organism will not develop correctly. For example, in fruit flies (Drosophila), mutation of a particular homeotic gene results in altered transcription, leading to the growth of legs on the head instead of antenna; this is known as the antennapedia mutation.
The role of homeotic genes in embryonic development was elucidated by American geneticists Edward B. Lewis and Eric F. Wieschaus and German geneticist Christiane NÃ¼sslein-Volhard. These researchers conducted their experiments in Drosophila and shared the 1995 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries. Homeotic genes homologous to those of Drosophila were later found in a wide range of organisms, including fungi, plants, and vertebrates. In vertebrates, these genes are commonly referred to as HOX genes. Humans possess some 39 HOX genes, which are divided into four different clusters, A, B, C, and D, which are located on different chromosomes.
