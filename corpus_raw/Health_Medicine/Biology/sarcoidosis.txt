Sarcoidosis,  systemic disease that is characterized by the formation of granulomas (small grainy lumps) in affected tissue. Although the cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, the disease may be caused by an abnormal immune response to certain antigens. Sarcoidosis often disappears spontaneously within two or three years but may progress to involve more than one organ. It is observed in the lungs, lymph nodes, eyes, salivary glands, muscles, liver, spleen, and the connective tissues of the nervous system. Skin lesions and bone cysts are characteristically present in the chronic form of the disease. Sarcoidosis may cause no symptoms, or an attack may begin with the appearance of tender red nodules on the front of the legs and with joint pain. A fever may be present that lasts from six weeks to three months. The chronic form of sarcoidosis usually results in severe disease of the lungs and kidneys; the lung disease may cause damage to the heart. There is no cure for sarcoidosis. The administration of corticosteroids such as prednisone, which reduce inflammation, usually brings relief of the symptoms.
