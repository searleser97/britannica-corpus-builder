Vocal cord, Latin plica vocalis,  either of two folds of mucous membrane that extend across the interior cavity of the larynx and are primarily responsible for voice production. Sound is produced by the vibration of the folds in response to the passage between them of air exhaled from the lungs. The frequency of these vibrations determines the pitch of the voice. The vocal cords are shorter and thinner in women and children, accounting in part for their higher-pitched voices. See speech.
The ventricular folds, located just above the vocal cords, are sometimes termed false vocal cords because they are not involved in voice production.
