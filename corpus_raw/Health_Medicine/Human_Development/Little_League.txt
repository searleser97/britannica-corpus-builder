Little League,  international baseball organization for children and teenagers, started in 1939 in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, by Carl E. Stotz and brothers Bert and George Bebble. The league originally included boys age 8 to 12. Girls have been admitted since 1974. Little League now includes a senior division for players age 13 to 15 and a big-league division for age 16 to 18.
Among teams of the junior division, the game is played on a field two-thirds the size of a professional baseball diamond, and games are six innings rather than nine. Of a team’s nine members, two must be under 11 years old, and no more than seven in the regular lineup may be 12. Leagues comprise 4 to 12 teams that play a season of about 15 games; the winners then engage in local and regional playoffs to qualify for the World Series, held annually in Williamsport. World Series teams from foreign countries were barred from the Little League World Series in 1975 because of questions of player eligibility, but they were restored in 1976.
Little League ball expanded greatly following World War II; in the early 21st century there were more than 2.5 million players in the United States and some 100 other countries. In 1974 softball programs for juniors and seniors were established. In 1990 the league began a program, known as the Challenger Division, for physically and mentally disabled children. The organization maintains a museum in Williamsport.
A number of organizations similar to Little League have also been successful, including Babe Ruth League (originally Little Bigger League, 1952–53), for boys and girls 13 through 18. Babe Ruth League was founded in 1952 in Trenton, New Jersey, and has been established in most sections of the United States and Canada. Playing rules and infield dimensions are those of professional baseball. Also played under these conditions is American Legion Baseball for teenagers, founded in 1925.
