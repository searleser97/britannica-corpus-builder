World Council of Service Clubs,   cooperative organization formed in 1946 by several international associations of young men’s service clubs for the purpose of furthering international cooperation and understanding and to encourage the extension of such clubs. Originally known as the World Council of Young Men’s Service Clubs, the name was changed in 1991 as the council’s mission expanded to include women. Service clubs for young people were seen as instrumental in developing a sense of civic responsibility in their members.
