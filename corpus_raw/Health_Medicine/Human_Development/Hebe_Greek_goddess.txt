Hebe,   (from Greek hēbē, “young maturity,” or “bloom of youth”), daughter of Zeus, the chief god, and his wife Hera.
In Homer this princess was a divine domestic, appearing most often as cupbearer to the gods. As the goddess of youth, she was generally worshiped along with her mother, of whom she may have been regarded as an emanation or specialized form. She was also associated with the hero-god Heracles, whose bride she became when he was received into heaven. Her major centres of worship were Phlious and Sicyon, where she was called Ganymeda and Dia. Hebe was sometimes identified with the Roman deity Juventas.
