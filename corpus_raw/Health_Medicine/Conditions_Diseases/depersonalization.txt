Depersonalization,  in psychology, a state in which an individual feels that either he himself or the outside world is unreal. In addition to a sense of unreality, depersonalization may involve the feeling that one’s mind is dissociated from one’s body; that the body extremities have changed in relative size; that one sees oneself from a distance; or that one has become a machine.
Mild feelings of depersonalization occur during the normal processes of personality integration and individuation in a high percentage of adolescents and young adults, and it need not impair social or psychological functioning. Such feelings may also occur in adults after long periods of emotional stress. When significant social or occupational impairment continues, however, an individual is considered to have a disorder that should be treated. Feelings of depersonalization may also be present as features of some personality disorders and as symptoms of depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia.
Depersonalization as a characteristic of psychological disorder is a prominent theme in existential and neoanalytic theories of personality. The British psychoanalyst R.D. Laing, for example, described depersonalization—experiencing oneself as invisible—as a defensive response to a pervasive sense of danger.
The term depersonalization has also been used to refer to social alienation resulting from the loss of individuation in the workplace and the community.
