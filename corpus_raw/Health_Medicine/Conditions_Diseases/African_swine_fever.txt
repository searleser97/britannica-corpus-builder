African swine fever (ASF),  also called warthog fever,  highly contagious and usually fatal viral disease of swine that is characterized by high fever, lesions, leukopenia (abnormally low count of white blood cells), elevated pulse and respiration rate, and death within four to seven days after the onset of fever.
The virus responsible for African swine fever is classified as an asfarvirus (family Asfarviridae, genus Asfivirus). It is physically, chemically, and antigenically distinct from the togavirus that causes hog cholera (swine fever). African swine fever virus can survive heat, putrefaction, smoking, partial cooking, and dryness and lives up to six months in chilled carcasses. The incubation period is from 5 to 15 days.
The disease was first identified in 1910 in Kenya, where it was noted in domestic swine after contact with forest pigs and warthogs. It was confined to certain parts of Africa until 1957, when the disease spread—perhaps by means of processed pork products—to Portugal and then to Spain, Italy, Brazil, and other countries. During the 1970s, African swine fever spread to South America and certain Caribbean islands, but rigorous eradication programs have controlled the disease in the Caribbean area.
African swine fever is difficult to distinguish from acute classical hog cholera. Both diseases produce high fevers that last for about four or five days. Once the fever has subsided, however, African swine fever virus characteristically causes death within two days (as opposed to seven days for hog cholera). Although immunization has been effective in the prevention of hog cholera, no immunization measures have been shown to be effective in the prevention of African swine fever, nor is there any effective treatment of the disease. The prohibition of pigs and pig products from countries in which the disease exists has prevented its further spread.
