Osler-Rendu-Weber disease, also called hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia,  hereditary disorder characterized by bleeding from local capillary malformations. In Osler-Rendu-Weber disease, capillaries in the fingertips and around the oral and nasal cavities are enlarged and have unusually thin walls; they are easily broken by accidental bumping or jarring, resulting in the release of blood into the tissues or externally. Blood clotting is normal, but frequent bleeding from the nose and elsewhere can cause severe anemia. Frequent nosebleeds may be treated with cauterization or laser; bleeding in vital areas requires surgery.
