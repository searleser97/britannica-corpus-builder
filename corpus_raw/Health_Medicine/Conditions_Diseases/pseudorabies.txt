Pseudorabies, also called Aujeszkyâ€™s disease, or mad itch,  viral disease mainly of cattle and swine but also affecting sheep, goats, dogs, cats, raccoons, opossums, skunks, and rodents. It is not considered to be a disease of humans. Infected swine lose their appetites and may have convulsive fits. Survivors of the initial attack scratch and are restless. A cow shows infection by rubbing against posts and by licking and biting the affected areas. The itching becomes so intense that the animal lunges and runs about in a rabieslike frenzy.
