Zellweger syndrome,  congenital disorder characterized by complete absence or reduction in the number of peroxisomes in cells. In the mid-1960s Swiss American pediatrician Hans Zellweger described the familial disorder among siblings; the syndrome was later named for him in recognition of his discovery.
Peroxisomes are membrane-bound organelles that contain enzymes capable of oxidizing and metabolizing molecules, such as fatty acids and amino acids, that are normally found in cells. Genetic mutations giving rise to Zellweger syndrome cause copper, iron, and substances called very-long-chain fatty acids to accumulate in the blood and in tissues, such as the liver, brain, and kidneys. Infants with Zellweger syndrome are often born with facial deformity and intellectual disability; some may have impaired vision and hearing and may experience severe gastrointestinal bleeding or liver failure. Prognosis is poorâ€”most infants with this syndrome do not live beyond one year.
