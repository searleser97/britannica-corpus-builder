Psychopathology, also called abnormal psychology,  the study of mental disorders and unusual or maladaptive behaviours. An understanding of the genesis of mental disorders is critical to mental health professionals in psychiatry, psychology, and social work. One controversial issue in psychopathology is the distinction between dysfunctional, or aberrant, and merely idiosyncratic behaviours.
