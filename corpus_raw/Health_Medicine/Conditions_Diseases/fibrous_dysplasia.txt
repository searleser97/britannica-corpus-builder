Fibrous dysplasia,  rare congenital developmental disorder beginning in childhood and characterized by replacement of solid calcified bone with fibrous tissue, often only on one side of the body and primarily in the long bones and pelvis. The disease appears to result from a genetic mutation that leads to the overproduction of fibrous tissue.
There are two types of fibrous dysplasia: monostotic and polyostotic. Monostotic fibrous dysplasia is characterized by an expanding mass composed of osteoblasts and fibroblasts that originates from bone tissue. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is characterized by masses of fibroblasts and woven bone.
Manifestations of the disorder include enlargement of the bones on one side of the face and base of the skull, bone pain, and a tendency to fractures. Individuals with fibrous dysplasia who exhibit caf√© au lait (pale brown) spots on the skin and an endocrine imbalance leading to precocious puberty, especially in girls, have a form of the disorder called McCune-Albright syndrome. Sometimes these patients also have symptoms of hyperthyroidism or acromegaly. Patients with McCune-Albright syndrome have somatic mutations (mutations in body cells as opposed to germ cells) of an intracellular hormone-signaling pathway that cause the pathway to remain constantly active.
Treatment is generally aimed at relieving bone pain. Drugs called bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate) may be used to prevent the breakdown of bone in some patients. Orthopedic surgery also may be necessary to alleviate disability resulting from fractures and bony overgrowth.
