Barotrauma,  any of several injuries arising from changes in pressure upon the body. Humans are adapted to live at an atmospheric pressure of 760 mm of mercury (the pressure at sea level), which differs from pressures experienced in underwater environments and in the upper atmospheres of space. Most body tissue is either solid or liquid and remains virtually unaffected by pressure changes; in certain cavities of the body, however, such as the ears, sinuses, lungs, and intestines, there are air pockets that either expand or contract in response to changes in pressure. Abrupt expansion or contraction of closed internal air spaces can injure or rupture surrounding tissues, such as the eardrum.
A fatal form of barotrauma can occur in submariners and divers. For example, if a person in a deeply submerged submarine rapidly surfaces without exhaling during the ascent, sudden expansion of air trapped within the thorax can burst one or both lungs. Another form of barotrauma may occur during mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. Air pumped into the chest by the machine can overdistend and rupture a diseased portion of the lung. Subsequent breaths delivered by the ventilator are then driven into the mediastinum (the space between the lungs), the pleural spaces, or under the skin of the neck, face, and torso, causing subcutaneous emphysema (the trapping of air under the skin or in tissues).
