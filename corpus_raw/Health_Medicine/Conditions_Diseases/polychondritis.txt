Polychondritis,  chronic disease characterized by inflammation and destruction of the cartilage of various tissues of the body. The cause of polychondritis is unknown, but the disease may be the result of an abnormal immune response. Symptoms include pain, redness, and swelling of the affected cartilage. Polychondritis begins in middle age and most often affects the external ear, nose, and joints. Involvement of the trachea may obstruct breathing or lead to pneumonia. Polychondritis also may affect the inner ear and cause deafness, or it may cause inflammation of the eyes. Corticosteroid medications are administered to moderate the symptoms of the disease, but the effects on the cartilage cannot be reversed.
