Rett syndrome, also called cerebroatrophic hyperammonemia,  rare progressive neurological disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, autism-like behaviour patterns, and impaired motor function. The disorder was first described in the 1960s by the Austrian physician Andreas Rett. Today Rett syndrome is classified as a pervasive developmental disorder, a group of conditions that includes the autism spectrum disorders and childhood disintegrative disorder.
In about 1 percent of affected individuals, Rett syndrome arises from an inherited sex-linked defect. The majority of cases, however, arise from sporadic mutations in a gene known as MECP2 (methyl CpG binding protein 2). Because this gene is located on the X chromosome, Rett syndrome almost always affects girls; the disorder is relatively rare, occurring in roughly one in every 15,000 females.
Rett syndrome causes progressive disabilities in intellectual and motor development, with the initial onset of symptoms usually appearing in infancy, between the 6th and 18th months of life. Symptoms include compulsive hand movements, reduced muscle tone, difficulties in walking, decreased body weight, failure of the head to grow with age, and increased levels of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia).
There is no cure for Rett syndrome. However, some symptoms may be treated through physical therapy, speech therapy, and the administration of medications to control anxiety or to alleviate depression.
