Hypoaldosteronism,  abnormally low serum levels of aldosterone, a steroid hormone secreted by the adrenal gland. Hypoaldosteronism nearly always arises as a result of disorders in which the adrenal glands are destroyed. However, there does exist a disease in which defective aldosterone synthesis and secretion from the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal gland occur in the presence of otherwise normal adrenocortical function.
Isolated aldosterone deficiency results in low serum sodium concentrations (hyponatremia), decreased extracellular (including plasma) volume, and high serum potassium concentrations (hyperkalemia). These biochemical changes cause weakness, postural hypotension (a decrease in blood pressure upon standing), salt craving, and heart block, which may be fatal. Hypoaldosteronism is often associated with mild to moderate kidney disease, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus. Under normal circumstances, the kidneys secrete an enzyme known as renin, which acts on a substance in the blood called angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin II, a peptide that stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal gland. However, in patients with diabetes mellitus, hypoaldosteronism is caused by deficient production of renin by the kidneys that leads to decreased production of angiotensin II and therefore decreased secretion of aldosterone.
Other causes of hypoaldosteronism are rare and are primarily the result of enzymatic defects in the synthesis of aldosterone and resistance of the kidneys to the actions of aldosterone. In patients with hypoaldosteronism from these causes, renin production by the kidneys is increased. Treatment of hypoaldosteronism consists of the administration of salt or a potent synthetic mineralocorticoid such as fluorohydrocortisone (fludrocortisone). Orally administered aldosterone is ineffective because it is poorly absorbed by the body.
