Torticollis, also called wryneck or stiff neck,  abnormality in which the neck is in a twisted, bent position such that the head is pulled to one side and the chin points to the other. In infants the most common causes of torticollis include congenital shortening of muscles on one side of the neck, malposition of the fetus in the uterus, and trauma to the sternocleidomastoid muscle of the neck during birth. In adults, poor posture, tumours of the cervical spine, and inflammation of cervical lymph nodes may cause the condition. Treatment may include stretching of the neck muscles, applying heat to the affected area, traction of the cervical spine, or a neck brace.
Spasmodic torticollis is a neurologic disorder thought to be caused by increased secretion of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to the neck muscles; the muscles of one side of the neck contract spasmodically. Treatment for spasmodic torticollis includes the injection of botulinum toxin (e.g., Botoxâ„¢) into the neck muscles; medications that reduce muscle stiffness and spasms also may be prescribed.
