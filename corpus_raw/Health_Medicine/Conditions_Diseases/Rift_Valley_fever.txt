Rift Valley fever,   viral infection of animals that is transmissible to humans and causes a febrile illness of short duration. Headache, intolerance to light (photophobia), muscle pain, loss of appetite, and prostration are common symptoms. The virus is borne by mosquitoes and spread by the insectâ€™s bite, although humans also can contract the disease by handling tissues or secretions of infected animals. The fever, first observed in the Rift Valley of Kenya, is found from Egypt through eastern and southern Africa. Recovery from the fever is ordinarily uncomplicated; rarely, there may be encephalitis, fatal hemorrhaging, or ocular involvement resulting in permanent visual impairment. There is no specific therapy. An attenuated strain of the causative virus has been used to immunize sheep and cattle, and a vaccine for humans has been under study.
