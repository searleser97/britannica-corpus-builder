Canine distemper,  an acute, highly contagious, disease affecting dogs, foxes, wolves, mink, raccoons, and ferrets. It is caused by a paramyxovirus that is closely related to the viruses causing measles in humans and rinderpest in cattle. A few days after exposure to the virus, the animal develops a fever, becomes apathetic, and refuses food and water. Further signs include coughing and discharges from the eyes and nose; vomiting and diarrhea; and involuntary muscular twitching (chorea), posterior paralysis, or convulsions.
Canine distemper is best treated by prompt injections of serum globulin; secondary infections are warded off by use of antibiotics. Most untreated cases are fatal. Immunity can, however, be conferred by vaccination.
