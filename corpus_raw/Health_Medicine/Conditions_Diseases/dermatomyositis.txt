Dermatomyositis,  chronic progressive inflammation of the skin and muscles, particularly the muscles of the shoulders and pelvis.
Dermatomyositis occurs in both children (some of whom recover in about two years) and adults. The disease is more common in women. In most cases the first symptom of dermatomyositis is a skin rash, which appears in a variety of forms. A reddish violet rash commonly appears on the upper eyelids with swelling of the skin around the eyes. A rash sometimes also appears on the cheeks, neck, shoulders, forehead, trunk, and elbows, as well as across the joints of the fingers and toes. Other symptoms include muscle weakness and pain. The muscles commonly affected are those of the neck, pharynx, and torso. Calcium deposits often develop in affected skin and muscles, and this calcification of tissues can be very disabling. Dermatomyositis in adults is associated with a higher incidence of certain cancers, including malignancies of the lung, breast, and gastrointestinal tract.
The characteristic muscular inflammation of dermatomyositis is similar to that seen in the related disorder polymyositis. In both diseases it is believed to result from destruction of cells caused by an autoimmune reaction—i.e., the reaction of the immune system against the body’s own cells—but the particular mechanisms responsible for the tissue injury of dermatomyositis are thought to differ from those that give rise to polymyositis.
Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are the most common treatment for dermatomyositis. Immunoglobulins and immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate also are used.
