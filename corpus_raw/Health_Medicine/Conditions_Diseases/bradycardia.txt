Bradycardia,  type of arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm) characterized by slowing of the heart rate to 60 beats per minute or less. A slow heart rate in itself may have little medical significance; bradycardia is frequent among young adults, especially in highly trained athletes or during sleep. However, bradycardia may indicate significant heart disease if accompanied by other symptoms. Bradycardia caused by a dysfunction of the sinoatrial node (sinus bradycardia), the heartâ€™s natural pacemaker, often produces weakness, confusion, palpitations, and fainting (syncope). When slowing alternates with rapid acceleration of the heart rate (tachycardia) in sick sinus syndrome or when bradycardia is accompanied by congestive heart failure or other serious complications, an artificial pacemaker may be necessary to regulate the heart rate. Another common cause of bradycardia, the blockage of electrical conduction through the atrioventricular node (heart block), is similar in its symptoms to sinus bradycardia. Bradycardia can also be produced by drugs such as digitalis or morphine and is a common abnormality in heart attack victims, for whom it often indicates a favourable prognosis.
