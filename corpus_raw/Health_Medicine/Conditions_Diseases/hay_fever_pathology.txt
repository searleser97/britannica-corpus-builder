Hay fever, also called allergic rhinitis,  seasonally recurrent bouts of sneezing, nasal congestion, and tearing and itching of the eyes caused by allergy to the pollen of certain plants, chiefly those depending upon the wind for cross-fertilization, such as ragweed in North America and timothy grass in Great Britain. In allergic persons contact with pollen releases histamine from the tissues, which irritates the small blood vessels and mucus-secreting glands; symptoms may be aggravated by emotional factors. Antihistamine drugs and inhaled corticosteroids provide symptomatic relief. The most effective long-term treatment is immunotherapy, desensitization by injections of an extract of the causative pollen administered once or twice a week for one or more years. Hay fever, like other allergic diseases, shows a familial tendency and may be associated with other allergic disorders, such as dermatitis or asthma.
