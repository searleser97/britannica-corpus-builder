Pustule,  a small circumscribed elevation of the skin that is filled with pus, a fluid mixture containing necrotic (decomposing) inflammatory cells. Pustules are often infected and have a reddened, inflamed base. The most familiar pustules are the pimples of persons with acne. Skin pustules also appear in conditions such as chickenpox and smallpox.
