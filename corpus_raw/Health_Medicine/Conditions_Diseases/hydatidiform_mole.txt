Hydatidiform mole,   in human pregnancy, abnormal growth of the chorion, the outermost vascular membrane that in a normal pregnancy would enclose the embryo and ultimately give rise to the placenta. In the situation in which the hydatidiform mole develops, the embryo is usually either absent or dead. The mole, a collection of sacs (cysts) containing a jellylike substance, resembles clusters of grapes and can attain a great size. Most of the moles are expelled in about the 20th week of pregnancy. The moler pregnancy is usually terminated by suction curettage. In a few cases, the mole spreads into the muscle of the uterus and causes bleeding. If this is severe, the obstetrician may remove the mole by surgery. In extremely rare instances, hydatidiform moles develop into choriocarcinomas, which are highly malignant tumours.
