Gastritis,  acute or chronic inflammation of the mucosal layers of the stomach. Acute gastritis may be caused by excessive intake of alcohol, ingestion of irritating drugs, food poisoning, and infectious diseases. The chief symptoms are severe upper-abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, thirst, and diarrhea; the illness develops suddenly and subsides rapidly. The only treatment necessary is temporary avoidance of food, followed by a nonirritating diet, sedatives, and antispasmodics; rarely, fluids by intravenous injection may be required. The ingestion of corrosives (acids, alkalies) causes a severe chemical gastritis, necessitating immediate emptying and thorough washing of the stomach.
Chronic gastritis may be caused by prolonged use of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), infection with Helicobacter pylori, or pernicious anemia. The symptoms are indefinite and often resemble those of functional digestive disorders. The symptoms may include discomfort, fullness or pain in the upper abdomen, and poor appetite. The treatment for chronic gastritis depends on its cause; antacids will usually eliminate symptoms and promote healing. Antibiotics are used to treat chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection. Chronic gastritis caused by pernicious anemia is treated with vitamin B12. Irritating drugs that cause the disease are discontinued.
