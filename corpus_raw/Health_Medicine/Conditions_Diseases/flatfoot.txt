Flatfoot,   congenital or acquired flatness of the longitudinal arch of the foot. Usually associated with loss of the arch is a rolling outward of the foot and heel, resulting in a splayfoot position. Normally the arch is maintained by the shape of the bones and by the ligaments and muscles of the foot. Of these three, the muscles are most important. At an early stage the foot may be flexible, and the flatness may result from stretching of the ligaments and weakness of the muscles. At a later stage the shape of the bones may be altered and the deformity become rigid.
Little is known regarding the causation of congenital flatfoot. All infants appear to have flat arches at birth because of the pad of fat under the instep. The normal arch does not appear until the infant begins to walk and thus develops his muscle power. Failure of development of the arch may be a normal racial or familial characteristic. In general, the problem is a disproportion between the weight to be borne and the muscles to bear it. In a few persons the deformity seems to result from excessive weight or an injury.
Many symptoms have been attributed to flatfootâ€”pain, swelling, muscular spasm, stiffness, and awkward gait. Other vague symptoms in the extremities and back, sometimes considered to be caused by flatfoot, probably are the result of the generalized muscle weakness that also produced flatfoot. Many persons who have flatfeet are entirely without disability or pain.
The aim of treatment is to secure proper position of the arch and heel by the use of adequate shoes, with or without supports, and to preserve that position by strengthening the muscles maintaining correction of arch and heel. Supports are indicated if pain is severe or fatigue excessive, but their prolonged use may weaken muscles. Few persons have pain severe enough to require surgery.
