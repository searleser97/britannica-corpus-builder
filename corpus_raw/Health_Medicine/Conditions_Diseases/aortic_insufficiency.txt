Aortic insufficiency,   failure of the valve at the mouth of the aorta—the principal artery that distributes blood from the heart to the tissues of the body—to prevent backflow of blood from the aorta into the left lower chamber (ventricle) of the heart, from which it has been pumped. The defect causes characteristic heart sounds, audible through a stethoscope. Affected persons may experience difficulty in breathing after mild physical exertion and may suffer spasms of difficult breathing while resting in bed. Congestive heart failure—the effects of the heart’s inability to function adequately as a pump—may develop. Aortic insufficiency may result from a congenitally defective valve, from rheumatic heart disease, or from syphilis. Medical treatment is directed toward management of the congestive heart failure; prevention of the recurrence of rheumatic heart disease; and prevention of bacterial endocarditis, bacterial invasion of the heart lining. Surgical treatment consists in replacing the diseased valve with a synthetic substitute or a transplant.
