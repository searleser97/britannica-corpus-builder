Placentae abruptio,   premature separation of the placenta from its normal implantation site in the uterus. The placenta is the temporary organ that develops during pregnancy to nourish the fetus and carry away its wastes. Placentae abruptio occurs in the latter half of pregnancy and may be partial or complete. The separation causes bleeding, so extensive in cases of complete separation that replacement of the lost blood by transfusion is necessary. In instances of complete placentae abruptio, the infant dies unless delivered immediately. In partial separation the mother is given oxygen, and the infant is delivered as soon as it is safe to do so. The cause of placentae abruptio is not known. It is more common in women who have borne several children and in women suffering from high blood pressure.
