Babesiosis, also spelled babesiasis, also called piroplasmosis,  any of a group of tick-borne diseases of humans and other animals caused by species of Babesia, protozoans that destroy red blood cells and thereby cause anemia. The Babesia genus was named for Romanian pathologist Victor Babes, who discovered the organisms in the late 19th century in the red blood cells of cattle.
Human babesiosis is relatively rare. The most common disease-causing Babesia pathogens occurring in humans are B. divergens, which is found primarily in Europe, and B. microti, which is found in the United States. Both species are transmitted by Ixodes ticks.
Cattle tick fever, from B. bigemina, occurs in cattle, buffalo, and zebu. Other Babesia species attack cattle, sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, swine, and dogs. Wild animals such as deer, wolves, foxes, wildcats, and pumas are susceptible to infections from certain Babesia species.
Mortality depends on the pest species and the resistance of the host; native animals often contract mild cases and recover with immunity. Various drugs can be used to clear the blood of the parasites. Because Babesia species are both host and vector specific, tick control plays an important role in reducing incidence.
