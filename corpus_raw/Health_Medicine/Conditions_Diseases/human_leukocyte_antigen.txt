Human leukocyte antigen (HLA),  any of the numerous antigens (substances capable of stimulating an immune response) involved in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. The HLA genes encode the cell-surface proteins that are part of the MHC.
HLA antigens are programmed by a highly variable gene complex consisting of more than 200 genes, all of which occur on chromosome 6. HLA genes are divided into three distinct groups: class I, class II, and class III. The possibility of numerous variations in these genes serves a key role in providing the immune system with the ability to defend against a wide range of antigens.
The HLA system is useful in tissue typing, in which tissues from one individual are analyzed to determine whether they can be successfully transplanted to another individual. A number of HLA genes are associated with human diseases, including certain autoimmune disorders and cancer.
