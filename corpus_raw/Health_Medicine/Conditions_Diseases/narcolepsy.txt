Narcolepsy,  a sleep disturbance that is characterized by sudden, uncontrollable spells of sleep during the day, with disturbances of sleep at night.
The syndrome usually occurs in youth or early adult life. The narcoleptic can fall asleep anywhere, anytimeâ€”while in conversation, at work, while eating, and even when standing or walking. Sleep may last a few seconds or several minutes, rarely for more than an hour, and the narcoleptic is easily awakened to an alert state. Narcoleptics may also experience sleep paralysis, which normally occurs as one is either falling asleep or awakening. Although mentally alert, the narcoleptic experiencing sleep paralysis is totally unable to move for a very brief period. Most narcoleptics experience rapid eye movement (REM) at the onset of sleep, in contrast to normal sleep, in which REM occurs about 90 minutes after the onset of sleep. Associated with narcolepsy is cataplexy, a brief impairment of muscle tone such as a limpness of the arms or legs.
Nacrolepsy is caused by the loss of neurons in the hypothalamus that specialize in the production of a hormone known as hypocretin (also known as orexin), which promotes wakefulness. The loss of hypocretin may in turn be linked to an underlying autoimmune disorder in which immune cells target the hormone for destruction. In some persons, autoimmunity against hypocretin is suspected to occur as a result of variations in genes that regulate cellular immunity.
