Earwax impaction,   filling of the external auditory canal with earwax, or cerumen. Normally the wax produced by skin glands in the outer ear migrates outward. If the earwax is produced too rapidly, it may become hardened and accumulate, thus plugging the outer ear canal and preventing sound passage to the tympanic (eardrum) membrane. This hearing impairment is painless. Impacted earwax is often found in infants, because the large cotton swabs used to remove the wax often push it further into the babyâ€™s tiny ear canal. The problem also exists among industrial workers because of the surrounding dirt that gets into the ears. Persons who have an abnormal number of hairs in their ears are also susceptible, because the earwax becomes enmeshed in the hairs and fails to work its way out. The symptoms usually include sudden deafness. The wax is easily removed by a physician.
