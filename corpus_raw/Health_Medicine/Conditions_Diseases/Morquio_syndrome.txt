Morquio syndrome, also called mucopolysaccharidosis IV,  rare hereditary disorder of intracartilaginous bone development that results in severe malformation of the skeleton (particularly the spine and long bones) and dwarfing. The disease is recognized within the first two years of life and is usually progressive until bone growth ceases in late adolescence. The vertebrae of the spine are wedge-shaped and flattened, and back deformity is common; compression of the spinal cord may occur if back deformity is severe. The heads of the thighbones are small and malformed, sometimes resulting in dislocation of the hip; knock-knees and asymmetrical development of paired bones are also common. Other symptoms include clouded corneas and circulatory malformations. Individuals with Morquio syndrome have a normal life expectancy. Treatment is directed toward symptoms of the disease.
