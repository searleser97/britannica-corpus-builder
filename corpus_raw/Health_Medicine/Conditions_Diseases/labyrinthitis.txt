Labyrinthitis,   inflammation, either acute or chronic, of the inner ear (the labyrinth). It is often a complication of a respiratory-tract infection, of syphilis, or of inflammation of the middle ear. Symptoms include vertigo and vomiting. There is also a loss of hearing and equilibrium in the affected ear. If there is no suppuration (pus formation), recovery usually occurs after a number of days. If there is pus formation, the inner-ear structures on the affected side are usually totally destroyed, with permanent loss of hearing in that ear.
