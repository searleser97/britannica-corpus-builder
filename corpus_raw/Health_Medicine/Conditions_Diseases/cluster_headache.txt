Cluster headache,  Vascular headache that recurs in clusters. Cluster headaches, which occur predominantly in men, last less than two hours but are intensely painful and recur several times a day for weeks to months. Attacks begin suddenly, often during sleep, with pain seeming to penetrate into the eye on one side, sometimes with stuffy nose on the same side. Drugs that cause blood-vessel contraction help in some cases. See also migraine headache.
