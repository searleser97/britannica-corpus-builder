Cat scratch disease,  bacterial infection in human beings caused by Bartonella henselae, which is transmitted by a cat bite or scratch. Transmission of the bacterium from cat to cat is thought to be by the cat flea. The clinical syndrome in the infected person is usually a self-limiting enlargement of the lymph nodes not requiring antibiotic treatment, but some patients develop serious health problems, including encephalopathy, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis (diseases involving the brain, the heart, and bone, respectively). Immunocompromised people are at high risk from pet-transmitted diseases, including cat scratch disease. Nevertheless, they often benefit significantly from pet companionship. If special emphasis is placed on good hygiene in dealing with the pet, the risk can be greatly reduced.
