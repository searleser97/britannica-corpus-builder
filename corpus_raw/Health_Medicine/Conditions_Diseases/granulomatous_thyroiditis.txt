Granulomatous thyroiditis, also called subacute thyroiditis, giant-cell thyroiditis, pseudotuberculous thyroiditis, or de Quervainâ€™s thyroiditis,  inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland, of unknown but presumably viral origin. It may persist from several weeks to a few months but subsides spontaneously.
The disease most frequently occurs in women. The thyroid gland becomes enlarged, and most patients complain of tenderness in the front of the throat and difficulty in swallowing. Other symptoms include those of hyperthyroidism (e.g., accelerated heart rate, sweating, tremor), which are transient, and thyroid gland pain, fatigue, muscle aches, and fever. Most patients with the disease require only mild pain relievers for alleviation of symptoms, although more severe cases may call for stronger drugs, including glucocorticoids.
