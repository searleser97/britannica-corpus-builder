Nephrotic syndrome, also called nephrosis,  group of signs of kidney malfunction, including a low level of albumin (a protein) and a high level of lipids (fats) in the blood, proteins in the urine, and the accumulation of fluid in the tissues. Nephrotic syndrome typically results in the loss of more than 3.5 grams of proteins per day. It may result from streptococcal infection, lupus erythematosus, renal vein thrombosis, or heavy-metal poisoning.
The nephrotic syndrome occurs usually in young children or young adults. Persons affected may lack appetite and experience irritability, vomiting, and diarrhea. High levels of fluids in the tissues can cause a 50 percent increase in body weight. In children the syndrome includes gross swelling of the face, while in adults the legs are most frequently afflicted. Low blood pressure and low plasma volume from lack of serum proteins occasionally cause severe vascular collapse. Protein malnutrition also leads to muscle wasting and growth retardation, especially in children. In treatment, attention is given to alleviation of the underlying disease and to elimination of the tissue fluids by increasing urine output.
