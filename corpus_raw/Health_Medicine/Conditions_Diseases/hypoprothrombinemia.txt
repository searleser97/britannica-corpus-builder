Hypoprothrombinemia,  disease characterized by a deficiency of the blood-clotting substance prothrombin, resulting in a tendency to prolonged bleeding. Hypoprothrombinemia is usually associated with a lack of vitamin K, which is necessary for the synthesis of prothrombin in the liver cells. In adults the condition occurs most commonly in cases of obstructive jaundice, in which the flow of bile to the bowel is interruptedâ€”bile being necessary for the intestinal absorption of vitamin K. Hypoprothrombinemia can also result from a general impairment in liver and intestinal-cell function or can follow exposure to dicumarol and related therapeutic anticoagulants. In the newborn a lack of prothrombin leads to the condition known as hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, characterized by spontaneous internal and external hemorrhage, particularly from the umbilicus or mucous membranes; although this abnormal bleeding tends to run a short, self-limited course, it can sometimes have a fatal outcome. If suspected, it can be prevented by the administration of vitamin K to the mother during labour.
