Astigmatism,  nonuniform curvature of the cornea (the transparent, dome-shaped tissue located in front of the iris and pupil) that causes the eye to focus images at different distances, depending on the orientation of light as it strikes the cornea. The effect of astigmatism can also be produced by abnormalities or misalignment of the crystalline lens (sometimes called lenticular astigmatism), although this is rare. The portions of the image that are not focused on the retina (the light-sensitive tissue lining the inside of the eyeball) appear blurred. Astigmatism occurs independent of the existence of nearsightedness or farsightedness. This condition usually can be corrected through a precisely designed lens (eyeglasses or some forms of contact lenses) that counteracts the underlying corneal asymmetry. Refractive surgery is also capable of correcting limited amounts of astigmatism in some situations.
A troublesome form of astigmatism, “irregular” astigmatism, can be caused by corneal scars and certain corneal diseases and is sometimes seen after corneal transplant. If significant, visual impairment from irregular astigmatism can be difficult to treat, although rigid contact lenses may help.
