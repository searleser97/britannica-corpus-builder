Medullary thyroid carcinoma,  tumour of the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland. It occurs both sporadically and predictably, affecting multiple members of families who carry gene mutations associated with the disease. In some families medullary thyroid carcinomas are the only tumours that appear, whereas in other families medullary thyroid carcinomas are one component of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2).
Medullary thyroid carcinomas are moderately malignant tumours that invade nearby tissues in the neck and spread to distant organs, such as the lungs and liver. A characteristic feature of these tumours is hypercalcitoninemia, an abnormally high serum concentration of a protein hormone called calcitonin, which is secreted by C cells. Calcitonin normally functions to lower the concentration of calcium in the blood when it rises above the normal value. However, despite marked increases in serum calcitonin concentrations, patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma do not have low serum calcium concentrations (hypocalcemia), because their tissues are resistant to calcitonin.
Nearly all patients affected by medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 have hereditary mutations in the RET (rearranged during transfection) proto-oncogene (a gene that can become a cancer-causing gene, or oncogene). Patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma should be tested for mutations in RET; if a mutation is detected, other family members should also be tested. Some people carrying hereditary mutations in RET will develop medullary thyroid carcinoma at a young age. Therefore, any individual carrying a RET mutation usually undergoes thyroidectomy (removal of the thyroid gland) at an early age, before a tumour appears.
