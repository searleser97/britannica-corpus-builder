Hyperglycemia,  elevation of blood glucose concentrations above the normal range; it is the laboratory finding that establishes a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Hyperglycemia results from a decrease in the bodyâ€™s ability to utilize or store glucose after carbohydrates are ingested and from an increase in the production of glucose by the liver during the intervals between meals. It is caused by a decrease in the production of insulin, a decrease in the action of insulin, or a combination of the two abnormalities. Mild hyperglycemia causes no symptoms, but more severe hyperglycemia causes an increase in urine volume and thirst, fatigue and weakness, and increased susceptibility to infection. Extremely high blood glucose concentrations result in loss of blood volume, low blood pressure, and impaired central nervous system function (hyperglycemic coma).
