Pentosuria,  inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism, characterized by the excessive urinary excretion of the sugar xylitol. It is caused by a defect in the enzyme xylitol dehydrogenase, by which xylitol is normally metabolized. No disabilities are incurred, and no dietary or other measures are necessary. Reducing properties of the urine of affected individuals may lead to confusion with, and unnecessary treatment for, diabetes mellitus, which is not related to pentosuria. Pentosuria has been observed almost exclusively in persons of Jewish descent.
