Delirium tremens (DTs),  delirium seen in severe cases of alcohol withdrawal (see alcoholism) complicated by exhaustion, lack of food, and dehydration, usually preceded by physical deterioration due to vomiting and restlessness. The whole body trembles, sometimes with seizures, disorientation, and hallucinations. Delirium tremens lasts 3â€“10 days, with a reported death rate of up to 20 percent, if untreated. Hallucinations may develop independently of delirium tremens and may last days to weeks.
