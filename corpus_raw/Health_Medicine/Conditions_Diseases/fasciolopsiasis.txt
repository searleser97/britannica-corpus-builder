Fasciolopsiasis,   infection of humans and swine by the trematode Fasciolopsis buski, a parasitic worm. The adult worms, 2–7.5 cm (0.8–3 inches) long, attach themselves to the tissues of the small intestine of the host by means of ventral suckers; the sites of attachment may later ulcerate and form abscesses. In the early stage of the infection, there is usually abdominal pain, as well as diarrhea and nausea alternating with constipation. Heavy infestations that go untreated cause general body weakness and fluid retention, which may have serious consequences, especially in children. Treatment is usually with praziquantel. In China, India, Thailand, and other parts of East Asia, infection in humans is usually contracted following ingestion of uncooked aquatic plants containing cysts of the worm larvae. A simple but effective preventive measure is the immersion of aquatic foods in boiling water.
