Heart block,   lack of synchronization in the contractions of the upper and the lower chambers of the heartâ€”the atria and the ventricles. The lack of synchronization may range from a slight delay in the ventricular contractions to total heart block, a complete lack of synchronization between the atria and the ventricles. A characteristic of heart block is that the ventricles contract more slowly than the atria. Heart block is caused by disease of some portion of the pathway over which the contractive impulse travels through the heart. The condition is treated by increasing the rate of impulses that regulate ventricular contractions; this can be done by administering drugs or by implanting an artificial pacemaker, a device that regulates heart action by means of minute electric shocks.
