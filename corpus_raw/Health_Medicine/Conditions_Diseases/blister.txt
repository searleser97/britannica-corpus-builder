Blister,   a rounded elevation of the skin containing clear fluid, caused by a separation either between layers of the epidermis or between the epidermis and the dermis. Blisters are classified as vesicles if they are 0.5 cm (0.2 inch) or less in diameter and as bullae if they are larger. Blisters can commonly result from pressure and friction on sites such as the palms or soles; they are produced when friction causes an upper skin layer to move back and forth over an underlying skin layer. A small gap opens up between them and becomes filled with fluid. Blisters may also occur as symptoms of contact dermatitis, viral infection, or an autoimmune disease, in which case they can appear anywhere on the body.
Blistering usually takes place within the uppermost layer of the skin (epidermis), producing fragile, easily broken blisters; subepidermal blisters are tenser and are more difficult to break. In either case, the blister fluid is usually clear and colourless; yellowish fluid is a sign that it contains pus and red that it contains blood. Friction blisters generally heal spontaneously, sometimes leaving a thickened callus; disease blisters may leave scars, particularly when they are located deep in the epidermis.
