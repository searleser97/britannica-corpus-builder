Callus, also spelled callous,  in osteology, bony and cartilaginous material forming a connecting bridge across a bone fracture during repair. Within one to two weeks after injury, a provisional callus forms, enveloping the fracture site. Osteoblasts, bone-forming cells in the periosteum (the bone layer where new bone is produced), proliferate rapidly, forming collars around the ends of the fracture, which grow toward each other to unite the fragments. The definitive callus forms slowly as the cartilage is resorbed and replaced by bone tissue. Two to three weeks after injury, strong bony extensions join the fractured bone ends, and the organized aspect of bone gradually recurs. The callus is resorbed over a period of months to years.
