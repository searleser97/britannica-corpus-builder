Trisomy 18, also called Edwardsâ€™ syndrome,  human chromosomal disorder that results from an extra (third) copy of chromosome 18. Infants born with this disorder are smaller than average and usually do not survive longer than a few months. Characteristics of the syndrome include severe mental and growth retardation; congenital heart disease and other internal defects; and a multitude of bodily deformities, such as low-set and malformed ears, cleft lip and palate, a receding chin, convex soles of the feet, a webbed neck, and fingers bent in a unique configuration. Trisomy 18 occurs in approximately one in 8,000 live births, and female infants are affected three to four times as often as males. There is no cure for this condition. A higher incidence of trisomy 18 is seen in infants born to women older than 35 years.
