Osteoclastoma, also called giant cell tumour of bone,  bone tumour found predominantly at the end of long bones in the knee region, but also occurring in the wrist, arm, and pelvis. The large multinucleated cells (giant cells) found in these tumours resemble osteoclasts, for which the tumour is named. Usually seen in female adults between the ages of 20 and 40, this relatively rare, painful tumour is potentially malignant. Most tumours are benign at the outset and are removed by curettage (scraping) or complete excision of the tumour. A small percentage of osteoclastomas may spread to other parts of the body (metastasize), particularly the lungs.
