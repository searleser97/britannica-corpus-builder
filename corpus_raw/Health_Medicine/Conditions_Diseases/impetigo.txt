Impetigo,  inflammatory skin infection that begins as a superficial blister or pustule that then ruptures and gives rise to a weeping spot on which the fluid dries to form a distinct honey-coloured crust. Impetigo is caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus bacteria. It is seldom contagious in adults, a little more so in children, and very contagious in newborn infants. Impetigo is the most common skin infection among children. It is spread by poor hygiene and crowding and is a particular problem in humid, hot weather. Impetigo is generally diagnosed by observation. In mild cases the lesions can be effectively treated with an antibiotic ointment; in more extensive involvement, especially in children, an oral antibiotic may be advisable.
