toxic shock syndrome,  inflammatory disease characterized by high fever, headache, diarrhea, vomiting, irritability, sore throat, and rash. Abdominal tenderness, severe hypotension, shock, respiratory distress, and renal failure sometimes develop. The condition is caused by an exotoxinâ€”that is, a toxin formed by bacteria, in this case primarily Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Toxic shock syndrome was first described in 1978, in a small group of children.
In the early 1980s the disease was associated primarily with menstruating women who used a certain brand of tampons. Scientists later found that several types of highly absorbent material (polyacrylate rayon and polyester foam), which are no longer used in tampons, promoted the bacterial production of toxins.
Toxic shock syndrome has been linked to a broad range of causes in men, women, and children, including skin wounds and postsurgical infections. Because bacteria can be resistant to certain antibiotics, treatment consists primarily of intensive support therapy. Most patients recover in 7 to 10 days with proper treatment. With treatment, the mortality rate for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome is about 3 percent. Streptococcal infections, by contrast, tend to be associated with greater mortality, with rates typically between 20 and 60 percent. In many patients the syndrome recurs up to eight months later but often in a milder form.
