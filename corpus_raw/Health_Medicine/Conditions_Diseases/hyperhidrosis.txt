Hyperhidrosis, also spelled hyperidrosis,  excessive sweating, either general or local. A person may sweat profusely in armpits and on palms, soles, and forehead when excited, afraid, or anxious. Inflammation of the sympathetic nerves can also cause local hyperhidrosis, as can trench or immersion foot (resulting from long periods when the feet are soaked and cold) and encephalitis. Generalized sweating can occur after a fever or when a person is overheated or has taken aspirin, alcohol, or a hot drink. Heavy general sweating may accompany malaria, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, brucellosis, diabetes mellitus, or hyperthyroidism. Encephalitis and diencephalic epilepsy can also cause this type of sweating.
