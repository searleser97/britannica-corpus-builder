Kleptomania,   recurrent compulsion to steal without regard to the value or use of the objects stolen. Although widely known and sometimes used as an attempted legal defense by arrested thieves, genuine kleptomania is a fairly rare mental disorder. A kleptomaniac may hide, give away, or secretly return the stolen items, but he seldom uses them or attempts to profit by their resale. The kleptomaniac usually has the economic means to purchase what he steals and obtains gratification from the theft itself rather than from its object.
Kleptomania is classified as a disorder of impulse control, meaning that the victim is unable to overcome the urge to steal and feels an increasing tension with attempts to resist, until yielding to the impulse gives release. In some cases, the stolen objects may have a symbolic sexual or other significance for the kleptomaniac, but the sexual aspects of the disorder are not always evident.
Psychotherapy can be effective in alleviating the disorder, but few kleptomaniacs seek help unless they are caught in a theft or are referred to a psychiatrist for treatment of depression or anxiety related to their fears of being apprehended.
