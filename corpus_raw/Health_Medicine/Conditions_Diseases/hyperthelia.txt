Hyperthelia,  abnormal presence of accessory nipples, a condition of relatively frequent occurrence (1 percent of male and female human population). The nipples usually occur along the primitive milk line, between the armpit and groin, corresponding to the distribution in lower animals. Usually accessory nipples lack mammary tissue, but occasionally, especially in pregnant or lactating women, one or more of these may enlarge and produce milk. Accessory nipples may be removed by surgery.
