Entropion,  inward turning of the border (or margin) of the eyelid (usually the lower eyelids), occurring most often in elderly persons. It is commonly caused by age-related alterations in the fibrous and muscular support of the eyelids. The turning in of the lid margin allows the eyelashes to rub against the cornea, with resultant irritation, a condition known as trichiasis. Ulceration of the cornea may be a serious complication. Entropion may also be due to congenital eyelid malformations, spasms of the muscle involved in lid closure (orbicularis oculi), or scarring and contracture from underlying eye disease or trauma. Symptoms from mild cases of entropion can be controlled with artificial eye lubrication and removal of any offending eyelashes. More serious or stubborn cases require surgical correction. Compare ectropion.
