Parathyroid adenoma,  disorder characterized by loss of mineral materials from the skeleton, the development of kidney stones, and occasionally progressive kidney insufficiency. Increase in the number (hyperplasia) of secretory cells of one or more of the parathyroid glands results in an excess of parathyroid hormone in the circulation. The action of parathyroid hormone removes calcium from the bones; the calcium may then be deposited elsewhere, as in kidney stones.
Symptoms include chronic tiredness and sleepiness, weakness, loss of appetite, constipation, nausea, thirst, and sometimes personality changes. Pain accompanies weakening of bones, and in 25 percent of cases so-called brown tumours develop in the ends of long bones; pathological fractures are not uncommon. The disease is twice as frequent in women as in men and usually begins in middle age. Treatment usually includes surgical excision of the adenoma. (See hyperparathyroidism.)
