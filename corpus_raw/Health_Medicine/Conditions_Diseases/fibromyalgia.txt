fibromyalgia,  chronic syndrome that is characterized by musculoskeletal pain, often at multiple anatomical sites, that occurs in the absence of an identifiable physical or physiological cause. Fibromyalgia affects about 2 to 8 percent of individuals worldwide. It is most commonly diagnosed in young and middle-aged women.
The underlying cause of the syndrome is not known with certainty. Though fibromyalgia is sometimes viewed as an aberrant and nonspecific response to various stressors such as trauma or infection, research has shown it to be associated with a specific pattern of molecular markers in the blood, which distinguishes it from related disorders. There also is evidence that fibromyalgia runs in families. Thus, some individuals may have increased susceptibility to fibromyalgia because of predisposing genetic factors. Fibromyalgia appears to be associated with an increase in sensitivity and activation of pain receptors. Because the pain response is amplified in fibromyalgia patients, what they perceive as painful stimuli is normally perceived as painless in healthy individuals.
Fibromyalgia is associated with complications ranging from psychological stress to anxiety and depression. Many persons with fibromyalgia also have overlapping symptoms of other so-called functional somatic syndromes, including chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. Many experience disturbed or unrefreshing sleep. Fibromyalgia is difficult to diagnose on the basis of symptoms, however, since virtually all the symptoms experienced by affected persons are common, nonspecific, and variable.
No treatment for fibromyalgia has been proved fully effective. Medications, physical therapy, or counseling may be employed to reduce disability and to help the patient cope with the chronic illness. Although symptoms sometimes improve, full recovery over a short time frame appears to be the exception.
