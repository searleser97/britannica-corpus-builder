Trichomoniasis,  infection by the flagellate protozoan parasite Trichomonas. Infection is most often intestinal, but it may occur in other cavities or organs such as the liver.
The species T. vaginalis is a common cause of sexually transmitted disease in humans. Infection occurs more commonly in women than in men. Symptoms are seen in less than one-third of affected individuals and include burning or discomfort during urination and burning, redness, or itching of the genitals.
The pear-shaped species T. gallinarum causes avian trichomoniasis in the intestine of fowl, especially chickens and turkeys. Symptoms are diarrhea, appetite and weight loss, ruffled feathers, and intestinal lesions. The method of transmission is not known. Also in birds, particularly pigeons, T. gallinae causes an often fatal infection in the upper intestine.
T. foetus, in the sheath of bulls and in the vagina and uterus of cows, produces bovine or venereal trichomoniasis. Transmitted through contamination or coitus, the parasites cause temporary infertility or abortion and may invade the unborn calf. Some immunity can be developed; certain bulls seem to be naturally resistant.
