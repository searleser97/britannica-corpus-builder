Xeroderma pigmentosum,   rare, recessively inherited skin condition in which resistance to sunlight and other radiation beyond the violet end of the spectrum is lacking. On exposure to such radiation the skin erupts into numerous pigmented spots, resembling freckles, which tend to develop into multiple carcinomas. The condition may occur in mild or severe forms. Protection from direct sunlight and surgical destruction of precancerous or established malignant lesions are the prescribed treatment.
