Hamartoma,   benign tumourlike growth made up of normal mature cells in abnormal number or distribution. While malignant tumours contain poorly differentiated cells, hamartomas consist of distinct cell types retaining normal functions. Because their growth is limited, hamartomas are not true tumours and some, such as hemangiomas that occur as birthmarks, may disappear with time. Bony tumours such as osteoid osteoma, an overgrowth of bone and immature bone tissue (osteoid), may cause pain and resorption of bone during growth. Hemangiomas, which are hamartomas composed of vascular tissue, may appear quite large at birth but are usually left untreated unless they threaten facial structures. Attempts at surgical removal run the risk of uncontrollable hemorrhaging and frequently leave a poorer appearance than the natural regression of the hamartoma.
