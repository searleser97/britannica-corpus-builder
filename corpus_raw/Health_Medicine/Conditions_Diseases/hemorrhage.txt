Hemorrhage,  Escape of blood from blood vessels into surrounding tissue. When a vessel is injured, hemorrhage continues as long as the vessel remains open and the pressure in it exceeds the pressure outside of it. Normally, coagulation closes the vessel and stops the bleeding. Uncontrolled hemorrhage can result from anticoagulant therapy, hemophilia, or severe blood-vessel damage, leading to excessive blood loss and shock.
