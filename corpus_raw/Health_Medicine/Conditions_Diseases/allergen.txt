Allergen,  substance that in some persons induces the hypersensitive state of allergy and stimulates the formation of reaginic antibodies. Allergens may be naturally occurring or of synthetic origin and include pollen, mold spores, dust, animal dander, insect debris, foods, blood serum, and drugs. Identification of allergens is made by studying both the site of symptoms (e.g., inhalants such as molds, pollens, and dander usually affect the eyes, nose, and bronchi; cosmetics often affect the skin of the face and hands) and the time that symptoms appear (e.g., seasonal allergy to pollen). See also antigen; reagin.
