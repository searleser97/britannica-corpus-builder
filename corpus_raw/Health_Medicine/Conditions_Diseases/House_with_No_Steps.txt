House with No Steps (HWNS),  Australian charitable organization that provides support, services, and employment for people with disabilities. House with No Steps was founded in 1962 as an outgrowth of a motorized-wheelchair club that had been started by a group of individuals with disabilities in Sydney.
The organization’s driving force was Dorothy Watts and her husband, Lionel Watts, who had struggled to find employment after he became a quadriplegic as a consequence of contracting polio in 1956. Confronted by a lack of understanding in the Sydney community and by the negative attitude that existed towards disabled people, the couple joined with others to build an organization that included branches across Australia within 10 years of its founding. The organization’s name is derived from a member’s request for help in finding a “house with no steps.”
By the 2010s, HWNS was providing support for more than 3,000 people with disabilities in about 200 locations in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and the Australian Capital Territory. HWNS provides support networks that allow people with intellectual, sensory, or physical disabilities to access appropriate living arrangements, gain employment, and participate in recreational activities. The organization helps both children and adults with disabilities to be actively involved in society and to take control of their own lives. HWNS’s headquarters are in 
Belrose, a suburb of Sydney..
