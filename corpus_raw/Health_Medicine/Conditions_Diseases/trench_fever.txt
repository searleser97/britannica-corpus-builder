trench fever, also called quintana fever or five-day fever,  infectious disease characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, weakness, sore muscles and joints, and often severe pain in the back and shins. There may be one period of fever, or the fever may recur several times at intervals of four to five days. The disease is transmitted from one person to another by a body louse harbouring the causative organism, the bacterium Bartonella quintana (Rochalimaea quintana or Rickettsia quintana). The incubation period is 14 to 30 days before sudden symptom onset.
Most persons recover within about two months; there may be relapses, however, and the disease becomes chronic in a small percentage of cases. The disease may be diagnosed through blood or serological tests, as well as through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of tissue or blood samples. Effective treatments include doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, and ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin antibiotic. These agents can bring permanent relief from symptoms but may require long-term use in persons with persistent bacteremia. Additional treatment may be needed to eliminate bacteria-carrying lice.
First recognized in 1915, trench fever was a major medical problem during World War I. It reappeared in epidemic form among German troops on the Eastern front during World War II. The control of body lice is the chief means of prevention.
