Pinta,   chronic tropical skin disease characterized initially by the appearance of dry, scaly papular lesions followed after several years by abnormally coloured patches called pintides. The pintides may be white, where pigment cells have been destroyed by the disease, or blue, red, or pink. The disease is native to Central and South America and is caused by infection with Treponema carateum, an organism that is indistinguishable from that of syphilis. There is some evidence of a degree of cross-immunity between the two diseases, and the treatment of both is the same. Unlike syphilis, however, pinta has little effect on the general health of the patient and is transmitted by nonvenereal contact.
