Inferiority complex,  a psychological sense of inferiority that is wholly or partly unconscious. The term has been used by some psychiatrists and psychologists, particularly the followers of the early psychoanalyst Alfred Adler, who held that many neurotic symptoms could be traced to overcompensation for this feeling. The use of the word complex later gained acceptance to denote the group of emotionally toned ideas, partially or even wholly repressed, organized around and related to such feelings of inferiority. The term inferiority complex has lost much of its significance through imprecise popular misuseâ€”for example, as an inappropriately facile explanation of any show of ambition by a person of less-than-average height.
