Renal cyst,   cyst in the kidney. A cyst is an enclosed sac or pouch that usually contains liquid or semisolid material. Several different types of cysts develop in the kidneys. Solitary cysts contain liquids and may be partially filled with blood. They vary widely in size. Some are present at birth, and others are caused by tubular obstructions. If sufficiently large, they can cause backaches and a dragging sensation. In kidney vascular diseases numerous small cysts may be formed by the dilatation of blood vessels. Obstruction of the lymphatic vessels leading to the kidney may result in cysts; these are generally small and relatively harmless except when they exert pressure upon a nearby blood vessel. Tapeworms may cause cysts in the kidneys. Symptoms include pain, difficulty in urination, blood in the urine, and the excretion of tapeworm eggs and segments in the urine. Usually, because of the possibility of a tumour, cysts require surgical exploration and removal.
Polycystic disease is a congenital defect in which one or both of the kidneys have numerous large cysts. In medullary cystic diseases, also thought to be congenital in origin, cysts form in the small collecting tubules that transport urine from the nephrons, the urine-producing units of the kidney. The disease generally does not have warning symptoms, but affected persons become anemic and have low salt concentrations and high levels of nitrogenous substances in the bloodstream. The kidneys shrink, have a granular surface, show many small cysts, and have large areas of scar tissue. The most common victims are older children and young adults.
