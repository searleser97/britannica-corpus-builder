Lymphedema,  an abnormal condition in which poor function of the lymphatic system allows fluid to build up in the tissues. Lymphedema is traditionally classified into two forms: primary, which is genetic, and secondary, which arises from an outside cause. However, each of those forms can have aspects of the other; for example, some cancer patients who develop secondary lymphedema may be genetically predisposed to do so.
Some forms of primary lymphedema are Milroy disease, which is present from birth to age two; lymphedema praecox (also called Miege disease), which occurs usually around puberty; and lymphedema tarda, which occurs after age 35. The most common cause of secondary lymphedema is filariasis, in which the parasitic nematode Wuchereria bancrofti takes up residence in the lymphatic system and causes an allergic reaction. In industrialized countries, secondary lymphedema often arises as a result of lymph nodes being removed during cancer surgery or after radiation treatments used to fight cancer.
The most common treatment for lymphedema is complete decongestive therapy (CDT), which has a two-phase course The first phase lasts several weeks and consists of a combination of skin care, compressive bandaging, exercise, and a form of massage called manual lymph drainage. The second phase of CDT favours self-treatment and the use of compressive garments.
