Quinsy,  also called Peritonsillar Abscess, pus-filled swelling in the throat that develops infrequently as a complication of acute tonsillitis. It extends through the tonsillar capsule into the loose connective tissue of the neck and displaces the involved tonsil toward the midline of the throat. Extreme pain accompanying the condition interferes with swallowing and talking. Often there is high fever and general prostration. Although acute tonsillitis is usually caused by streptococci, these organisms are not always present in the quinsy pus. Surgical incision and draining are sometimes needed if antibiotics are not given promptly.
