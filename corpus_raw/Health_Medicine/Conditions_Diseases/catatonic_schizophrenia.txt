Catatonic schizophrenia,  rare severe mental disorder characterized by striking motor behaviour, typically involving either significant reductions in voluntary movement or hyperactivity and agitation. In some cases, the patient may remain in a state of almost complete immobility, often assuming statuesque positions. Patients may remain motionless in a rigid posture for hours or even days.
Other symptoms of catatonic schizophrenia include mutism (inability to talk), extreme compliance, stupor, and absence of almost all voluntary actions. This state of inactivity is at times preceded or interrupted by episodes of excessive motor activity and excitement, generally of an impulsive, unpredictable kind.
The cause of catatonic schizophrenia is not clear. An imbalance of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, which would potentially contribute to abnormal brain function, may be involved. Various factors can trigger the onset of the condition, including alcohol or drugs. Patients may be treated with psychotherapy, with electroconvulsive therapy, and with medications such as barbiturates or benzodiazepines.
Historically, catatonic behaviour was first observed in patients with schizophrenia, and it was later also observed in patients with various other mental conditions, particularly certain mood disorders such as depression; in those cases, it is described by the term catatonia.
