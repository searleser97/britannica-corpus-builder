Renal carcinoma, also called Clear-cell Carcinoma, Hypernephroid Tumour, or Hypernephroma,  malignant tumour affecting the epithelial (covering and lining) cells of the kidney.
Most renal carcinomas appear in persons past 40 years of age, with peak incidence around the sixth or seventh decade. They tend to arise in persons with vascular disorders of the kidneys; because they are in close proximity to the bloodstream, they frequently send secondary tumours to other organs of the body such as the lungs, liver, brain, and bone tissue.
The renal carcinoma forms a large rounded mass in one or both of the kidneys. It is chiefly yellow in colour because of the large amount of lipid (fat) substances present. There are also reddened areas, where blood vessels have bled, and cysts containing watery fluids. The body of the tumour generally shows numerous large blood vessels, the walls of which are composed of tumour cells.
Renal carcinomas are frequently not recognized until they manifest themselves in other parts of the body. Painless bleeding into the urine may occur early in the disease but is usually disregarded by the person afflicted. Pain is uncommon until late in the development of the disease. The tumour causes deformity in one or more of the cavities in the kidney at an early stage; if tumours are suspected, a specialized X-ray will show these distortions.
Renal carcinoma may spontaneously regress. After a tumour has been surgically removed there may be no recurrence, or there may be a recurrence as much as 20 years later.
