Clostridial infection,  any of several infectious conditions in animals and humans resulting from Clostridium species, bacteria that are found in soil and that enter the body via puncture wounds or contaminated food. These bacteria synthesize and release poisonous substances called exotoxins. There are two main types of exotoxins produced by Clostridium: enterotoxins, which exert their actions on the enteric cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and neurotoxins, which cause neuronal dysfunction.
Enterotoxins produced by C. perfringens cause several gastrointestinal diseases in sheep, including lamb dysentery, struck, and pulpy kidney. Exotoxins produced by C. perfringens also cause disease in humans, including gas gangrene, enteritis necroticans, and food poisoning. Botulism, a type of poisoning arising from improperly sterilized foods or from wound infection, is caused by neurotoxins released by C. botulinum. Tetanus, or lockjaw, is caused by the release of neurotoxins from C. tetani, which can be introduced into the body through a wound; sheep, swine, cattle, horses, humans, and, rarely, dogs are susceptible.
A series of acute, often gangrenous, infections in livestock and waterfowl are caused by other species of Clostridium: braxy (C. septicum), blackleg (C. chauvoei), bacillary hemoglobinuria (C. haemolyticum), and black disease and bighead (C. novyi).
Immunity can be conferred against some Clostridium bacteria, and antitoxins are available for the treatment of infected humans and animals.
