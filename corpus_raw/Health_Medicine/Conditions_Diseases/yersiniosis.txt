Yersiniosis,  acute gastrointestinal infection caused by the bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica, characterized by fever, often-bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain. A temporary rash called erythema nodosum also may appear on the skin, and the disease can lead to a temporary arthritis of the knees, ankles, or wrists. Frequently occurring in young children, the infection is more common during the winter months.
Most people acquire yersiniosis from contaminated foods, water, and unpasteurized milk; raw or undercooked pork products (e.g., raw pork intestines, or chitterlings) are a major source of the disease. Refrigeration of these foods is not sufficient protection from infection with the bacterium, which grows well at refrigerator temperatures (4 °C, or 39 °F). The expanding international trade of agricultural goods and the mass production of meat and dairy products are believed to be responsible for the increase in human cases of yersiniosis.
Although most people recover from yersiniosis without treatment, individuals who have suppressed immune systems or excess iron in their blood (hemochromatosis) may require antibiotics if the bacterium causes septicemia or infections in other organs. Proper sanitation and sterilization of food-processing equipment are essential methods for reducing the occurrence of yersiniosis infections.
