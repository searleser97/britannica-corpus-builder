Cystathioninuria,  metabolic disorder involving the amino acid methionine. Cystathioninuria generally is hereditary in nature but also may occur in association with certain diseases of the kidneys or liver, with certain types of tumours, or with pyridoxine deficiency (a type of vitamin B6 deficiency).
The normal metabolic pathway of methionine is its conversion in successive steps to homocysteine, cystathionine, and cysteine, each step being effected by a specific enzyme. In cystathioninuria, the enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase, which normally catalyzes the hydrolysis of cystathionine to cysteine, is defective. As a result, abnormally high concentrations of cystathionine appear in the urine. Although the enzyme appears to be present in the tissues of affected persons, it is inactive until an excess of vitamin B6 is available. In some cases, the administration of vitamin B6 brings about a dramatic response, which results in a marked fall in cystathionine excretion.
Most affected individuals experience cystathioninuria as a mild disorder, evincing only the abnormal urinary excretion of cystathionine; sometimes, however, the disorder is associated with intellectual disability. Compare homocystinuria.
