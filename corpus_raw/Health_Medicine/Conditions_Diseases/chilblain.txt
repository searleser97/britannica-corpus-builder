Chilblain, also called pernio, or erythema pernio,  an inflammatory swelling of the skin of the hands or feet, resulting from exposure to cold. The condition is believed to result from cold hypersensitivity of small vessels of the skin. Tissue damage is less severe with chilblains than with frostbite, where the skin is actually frozen. Red, itching papules and patches of eroded tissue appear on the skin, which is cold and clammy to the touch; severe chilblains may blister and swell. The condition is aggravated by warmth, and sudden rewarming is not recommended. The preferred treatment is to elevate the affected part and allow it to warm gradually at room temperature.
