Fibrosarcoma,  rare malignant tumour of fibrous tissue most commonly found in middle-age adults and primarily occurring in the thighbone, upper arm bone, or jaw; the tumour also may arise in soft tissues and organs. The mass is detectable by palpation before pain occurs. The tumour may invade surrounding tissues, which makes complete surgical excision difficult. It often recurs, and it may metastasize if the cells are large, have bizarre shapes, and are abundantly replicating. Tumours with cells that have a less unusual appearance have a much better prognosis.
