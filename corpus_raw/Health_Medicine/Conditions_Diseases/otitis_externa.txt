Otitis externa,   dermatitis of the external auditory canal and sometimes also of the exposed ear. The skin on these ear parts becomes dry, scaling, and itchy, and there may be foul-smelling watery or purulent discharge, pain, fever, and intermittent deafness. Predisposing factors include excessive perspiration, trauma, allergy, underwater swimming and diving, and a warm, damp environment. The infection, which may be recurrent, is usually bacterial in origin.
