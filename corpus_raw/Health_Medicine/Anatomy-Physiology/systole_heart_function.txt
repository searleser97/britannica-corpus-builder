Systole,  period of contraction of the ventricles of the heart that occurs between the first and second heart sounds of the cardiac cycle (the sequence of events in a single heart beat). Systole causes the ejection of blood into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. Lasting usually 0.3 to 0.4 second, ventricular systole is introduced by a very brief period of contraction, followed by the ejection phase, during which 80 to 100 cc of blood leave each ventricle. During systole, arterial blood pressure reaches its peak (systolic blood pressure), normally about 90 to 120 mm of mercury in humans. In an electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG), the beginning of ventricular systole is marked by the deflections of the QRS complex. Atrial systole occurs toward the end of ventricular diastole, completing the filling of the ventricles. In an ECG, atrial systole is associated with atrial depolarization, or the P wave deflection. “Systole” may also refer to the contraction stage of the contractile vacuole in protozoans. Compare diastole. See also blood pressure.
