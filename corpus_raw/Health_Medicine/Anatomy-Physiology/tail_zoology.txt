Tail,   in zoology, prolongation of the backbone beyond the trunk of the body, or any slender projection resembling such a structure. The tail of a vertebrate is composed of flesh and bone but contains no viscera. In fishes and many larval amphibians, the tail is of major importance in locomotion. In most land-dwelling quadrupeds it is not an important locomotory device, although in animals such as crocodiles, otters, and whales, which are secondarily adapted to an aquatic environment, the tail, often flattened, again becomes important. Arboreal animals (e.g., squirrel) use the tail for balance and as a rudder when leaping; in some (e.g., spider monkey, chameleon) it is prehensile, a fifth limb for increased mobility and stability. Other adaptive uses of the tail are for defense (e.g., porcupine), social signals (dog), warning signals (rattlesnake), and hunting (alligator). Most of the tail vertebrae of birds have been fused into the short pygostyle bone; this appendage holds the tail feathers, which aid in flight maneuverability.
