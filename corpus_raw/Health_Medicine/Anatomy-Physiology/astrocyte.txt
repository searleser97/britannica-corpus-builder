Astrocyte,  star-shaped cell that is a type of neuroglia found in the nervous system in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Astrocytes can be subdivided into fibrous and protoplasmic types. Fibrous astrocytes are prevalent among myelinated nerve fibres in the white matter of the central nervous system. Organelles seen in the somata of neurons also are seen in astrocytes, but they appear to be much sparser. These cells are characterized by the presence of numerous fibrils in their cytoplasm. The main processes exit the cell in a radial direction (hence the name astrocyte, meaning “star-shaped cell”), forming expansions and end feet at the surfaces of vascular capillaries.
Unlike fibrous astrocytes, protoplasmic astrocytes occur in the gray matter of the central nervous system. They have fewer fibrils within their cytoplasm, and cytoplasmic organelles are sparse, so that the somata are shaped by surrounding neurons and fibres. The processes of protoplasmic astrocytes also make contact with capillaries
Astrocytes divide after injury to the nervous system and occupy the spaces left by injured neurons. Astrocytes also are thought to have high-affinity uptake systems for neurotransmitters such as glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This function is important in the modulation of synaptic transmission, since uptake systems tend to terminate neurotransmitter action at the synapses and also may act as storage systems for neurotransmitters when they are needed.
