Cephalic index,  the percentage of breadth to length in any skull. The index is calculated from measurement of the diameters of the skull. The length of the skull is the distance from the glabella (the midpoint between the brows) and the most projecting point at the back of the head. The breadth of the skull is the distance between the most projecting points at the sides of the head, usually a little above and behind the ears. The cephalic index is the breadth multiplied by 100 divided by the length. An index of less than 75 means that the skull is long and narrow when seen from the top; such skulls are called dolichocephalic and are typical of Australian aborigines and native southern Africans. An index of 75 to 80 means that the skull is nearly oval; such skulls are called mesaticephalic and are typical of Europeans and the Chinese. A skull having an index of over 80 is broad and short, and is called brachycephalic; such skulls are common among Mongolians and the Andaman Islanders.
