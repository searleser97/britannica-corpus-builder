Lens,  in anatomy, a nearly transparent biconvex structure suspended behind the iris of the eye, the sole function of which is to focus light rays onto the retina. The lens is made up of unusual elongated cells that have no blood supply but obtain nutrients from the surrounding fluids, mainly the aqueous humour that bathes the front of the lens. Waste products are removed through these fluids as well. The shape of the lens can be altered by the relaxation and contraction of the ciliary muscles surrounding it, thus enabling the eye to focus clearly on objects at widely varying distances. The ability of the lens to adjust from a distant to a near focus, called accommodation, gradually declines with age (a condition called presbyopia), often requiring correction. Clouding or opacity of the lens, called a cataract, may also occur with age. Cataracts that interfere with vision can be corrected by surgery, during which the clouded lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens.
