Morphogenesis,  the shaping of an organism by embryological processes of differentiation of cells, tissues, and organs and the development of organ systems according to the genetic “blueprint” of the potential organism and environmental conditions.
Plant morphogenesis is brought about chiefly through differential growth. Permanent embryonic tissue results in a morphogenetic potential that varies greatly with the environment and continues to produce new organs throughout the life of the plant. Animal morphogenesis is accomplished by growth and by cell movement. A fixed pattern is established early; the organism is determined as to shape, size, and organ complement. Once organs are formed, no new ones (with few exceptions) are produced. See also histogenesis; organogenesis.
