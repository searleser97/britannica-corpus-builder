Aorta,   in vertebrates and some invertebrates, the blood vessel (or vessels) carrying blood from the heart to all the organs and other structures of the body.
At the opening from the left ventricle into the aorta is a three-part valve that prevents backflow of blood from the aorta into the heart. The aorta emerges from the heart as the ascending aorta, turns to the left and arches over the heart (the aortic arch), and passes downward as the descending aorta. The left and right coronary arteries branch from the ascending aorta to supply the heart muscle. The three main arteries branch from the aortic arch and give rise to further branches that supply oxygenated blood to the head, neck, upper limbs, and upper part of the body. The descending aorta runs down through the posterior centre of the trunk past the heart, lungs, and esophagus, through an opening in the diaphragm, and into the abdominal cavity.
In the chest the aorta, as it descends, gives off branches to (1) the pericardium, the sac that encloses the heart, (2) the connective tissues of the lungs, (3) the bronchi, which carry air from the windpipe into the lungs, (4) the esophagus, (5) part of the diaphragm, and (6) the chest wall.
In the abdominal cavity the aorta gives off a number of branches, which form an extensive network supplying blood to the stomach, liver, pancreas, spleen, small and large intestines, kidneys, reproductive glands, and other organs. At the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra, which is about even with the top of the hip bones, the aorta divides into the right and left common iliac arteries, the principal arteries to the legs.
