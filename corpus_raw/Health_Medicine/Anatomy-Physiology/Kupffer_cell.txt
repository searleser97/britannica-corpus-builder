Kupffer cell,   any of the stellate (star-shaped) cells in the linings of the liver sinusoids. The sinusoids are microscopic blood channels. The Kupffer cells are phagocytic, i.e., capable of ingestion of other cells and of foreign particles. They also store hemosiderin so that it is available for the production of hemoglobin, the oxygen-transporting component of the red blood cell. Hemosiderin is an iron-containing pigment that is formed from the hemoglobin of red blood cells that have disintegrated.
