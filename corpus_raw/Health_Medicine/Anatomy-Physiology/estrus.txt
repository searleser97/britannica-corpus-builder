Estrus, also spelled Oestrus,  the period in the sexual cycle of female mammals, except the higher primates, during which they are in heat—i.e., ready to accept a male and to mate. One or more periods of estrus may occur during the breeding season of a species. Prior to ovulation the endometrium (uterine lining) thickens, in preparation for holding the fertilized ova. As the proliferation of uterine tissue reaches its peak, receptivity is highest—this is the estrous period. Some animals (e.g., dogs) are monestrous, having only one heat during a breeding season. Others (e.g., ground squirrels) are polyestrous: if not impregnated, they will come into heat repeatedly during the breeding season. Males can recognize a female in heat by smell; certain substances (pheromones) are secreted only at this portion of her cycle. The female’s genital area may be swollen during estrus, and she may show by a variety of behavioral signals that she is ready to mate.
