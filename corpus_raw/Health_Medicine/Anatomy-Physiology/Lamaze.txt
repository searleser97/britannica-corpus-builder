Lamaze,   method of childbirth that involves psychological and physical preparation by the mother for the purpose of suppressing pain and facilitating delivery without drugs.
The Lamaze method, one of the more popular methods of childbirth preparation, was introduced by Fernand Lamaze in the 1950s as an attempt to lessen pain-increasing tension and anxiety of childbirth. Lamaze emphasized education about the stages of labour and delivery (to reduce tension generated by fear based on ignorance of the process) and taught physical and psychological methods for relaxing the voluntary muscles during labour. Applying Pavlov’s theory of conditioned reflexes, Lamaze taught the use of distraction techniques to decrease women’s perceptions of discomfort during labour contractions. These techniques include deep and shallow breathing, rhythmic light abdominal massage (effleurage), and concentration on external focal points or on internal visualization of pleasant experiences; all are designed to draw attention away from the pain of the childbirth process.
Lamaze and other methods of prepared, or “natural,” childbirth rely on supervised training and practice in relaxation techniques during the weeks before the birth. Both the mother-to-be and a supportive partner, who helps to distract the mother, are fully trained in Lamaze techniques. Expectant mothers perform exercises to strengthen the abdomen and relax the muscles around the birth canal; this preparation helps to reduce the strain of pushing during delivery. Another exercise is the rehearsal of deep chest breathing and rapid, shallow breathing during periods of maximum strain; this technique helps to reduce uterine tension. By frequent repetition, proper breathing techniques become semiautomatic. Lamaze training also includes instruction in the processes of labour and delivery.
