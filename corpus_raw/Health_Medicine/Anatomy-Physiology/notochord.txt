Notochord,   flexible rodlike structure of mesodermal cells that is the principal longitudinal structural element of chordates and of the early embryo of vertebrates, in both of which it plays an organizational role in nervous system development. In later vertebrate development, it becomes part of the vertebral column. The notochord derives during gastrulation (infolding of the blastula, or early embryo) from cells that migrate anteriorly in the midline between the hypoblast and the epiblast (inner and outer layers of the blastula). These cells coalesce immediately beneath the developing central nervous system. With the formation of the vertebral column, the notochord is incorporated into the column as the centres of the intervertebral discs, called the nuclei pulposi, which cushion the vertebrae.
