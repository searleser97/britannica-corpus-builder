Facial nerve,  nerve that originates in the area of the brain called the pons and that has three types of nerve fibres: (1) motor fibres to the superficial muscles of the face, neck, and scalp and to certain deep muscles, known collectively as the muscles of facial expression; (2) sensory fibres, carrying impulses from the taste sensors in the front two-thirds of the tongue and general sensory impulses from tissues adjacent to the tongue; and (3) parasympathetic fibres (part of the autonomic nervous system) to the ganglia (groups of nerve cells) governing the lachrymal (tear) glands and certain salivary glands.
