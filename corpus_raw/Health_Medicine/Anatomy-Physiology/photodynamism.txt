Photodynamism,   conversion of certain substances in the skin of animals into other substances by the action of light. The resultant compounds may be beneficial (e.g., vitamin D), but in some cases they produce disorders of the skin. The original compound may be present in normal skin; it may be derived from certain foods; it may result from an inherited biochemical defect; or it may be a combination of the preceding.
