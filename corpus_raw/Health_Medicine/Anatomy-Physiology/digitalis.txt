Digitalis,  drug obtained from the dried leaves of the common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) and used in medicine to strengthen contractions of the heart muscle. Belonging to a group of drugs called cardiac glycosides, digitalis is most commonly used to restore adequate circulation in patients with congestive heart failure, particularly as caused by atherosclerosis or hypertension. The drug is also used to slow the rate of ventricular contraction in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter. Digitalis directly increases the contractile power of the heart muscle, enabling a disease-weakened heart to keep up with the body’s demand for heart action. Other effects of digitalis include a slowing of the heartbeat, an increase in the heart’s output, and a decrease in the size of the heart. Digitoxin and digoxin are among the most commonly prescribed forms of digitalis. Treatment with either of these drugs must involve careful monitoring to avoid adverse effects (e.g., heart palpitations, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea) that may result from their accumulation in the body.
Digitalis was first prescribed by English physician and botanist William Withering (1741–99), who used it in the treatment of edema (dropsy). In An Account of the Foxglove, and Some of Its Medical Uses (1785), he summarized the results of his extensive studies of the drug and described the symptoms of digitalis toxicity.
