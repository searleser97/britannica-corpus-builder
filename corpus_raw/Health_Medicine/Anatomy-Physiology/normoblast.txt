Normoblast,  nucleated normal cell occurring in red marrow as a stage or stages in the development of the red blood cell (erythrocyte). Some authorities call the normoblast a late-stage erythroblast, the immediate precursor of the red blood cell; others distinguish the normal immature red cell—normoblast—from an abnormal, overlarge, immature red cell—the megaloblast. See also erythrocyte.
