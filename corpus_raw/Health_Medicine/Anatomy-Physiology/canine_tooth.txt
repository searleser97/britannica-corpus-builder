Canine tooth, also called cuspid or eye tooth,  in mammals, any of the single-cusped (pointed), usually single-rooted teeth adapted for tearing food, and occurring behind or beside the incisors (front teeth). Often the largest teeth in the mouth, the canines project beyond the level of the other teeth and may interlock when the mouth is closed, restricting the animal to an up-and-down chewing action. Among sheep, oxen, and deer, only the upper canines are large; the lower ones resemble incisors. Rodents lack canines. The tusks of wild boar, walrus, and the extinct sabre-toothed cat are enlarged canines. (The tusks of elephants are upper incisors, not canine teeth. Canine teeth are absent.) In some animals (e.g., pig, deer, baboon, gorilla), the male has much larger canines than does the female; these perform a threatening and protective function besides that of tearing.
Humans have small canines that project slightly beyond the level of the other teethâ€”thus, in humans alone among the primates, rotary chewing action is possible. In humans there are four canines, one in each half of each jaw. The human canine tooth has an oversized root, a remnant of the large canine of the nonhuman primates. This creates a bulge in the upper jaw that supports the corner of the lip.
