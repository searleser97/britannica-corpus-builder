Renal system,  in humans, organ system that includes the kidneys, where urine is produced, and the ureters, bladder, and urethra for the passage, storage, and voiding of urine.
In many respects the human excretory, or urinary, system resembles those of other mammalian species, but it has its own unique structural and functional characteristics. The terms excretory and urinary emphasize the elimination function of the system. The kidneys, however, both secrete and actively retain within the body certain substances that are as critical to survival as those that are eliminated.
The system contains two kidneys, which control the electrolyte composition of the blood and eliminate dissolved waste products and excess amounts of other substances from the blood; the latter substances are excreted in the urine, which passes from the kidneys to the bladder by way of two thin muscular tubes called the ureters. The bladder is a sac that holds the urine until it is eliminated through the urethra.
The kidneys are bean-shaped, reddish brown paired organs, concave on one long side and convex on the opposite. They are normally located high in the abdominal cavity and against its back wall, lying on either side of the vertebral column between the levels of the 12th thoracic and third lumbar vertebrae, and outside the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdomen.
The long axes of the kidneys are aligned with that of the body, but the upper end of each kidney (pole) is tilted slightly inward toward the backbone (vertebral column). Situated in the middle of the medial concave border is a deep vertical cleft, the hilus, which leads to a cavity within the kidney known as the renal (kidney) sinus. The hilus is the point of entry and exit of the renal arteries and veins, lymphatic vessels, nerves, and the enlarged upper extension of the ureters.
