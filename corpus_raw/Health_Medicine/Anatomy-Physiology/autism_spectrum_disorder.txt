Autism spectrum disorder (ASD),  any of a group of neurobiological disorders that are characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication and by abnormalities in behaviours, interests, and activities.
In 1911 Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler coined the term autism (from the Greek autos, meaning “self”), using it to describe the withdrawal into the self that he observed in patients affected by schizophrenic disorders. However, in 1943 Austrian-born American psychiatrist Leo Kanner recognized autism as a disorder distinct from schizophrenia, giving autism its modern description. In the subsequent decades several autismlike disorders also were identified, resulting in the group of conditions known as autism spectrum disorders, or ASDs.
The group of ASDs includes three distinct neurobiological disorders: autism (or classic autism), Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). All three of these disorders are included under the broad classification of pervasive developmental disorders, a group of conditions characterized by early-childhood onset and impairment of language acquisition, communication, social behaviour, and motor function.
