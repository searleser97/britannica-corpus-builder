Mesentery,  a continuous folded band of membranous tissue (peritoneum) that is attached to the wall of the abdomen and encloses the viscera. In humans, the mesentery wraps around the pancreas and the small intestine and extends down around the colon and the upper portion of the rectum. One of its major functions is to hold the abdominal organs in their proper position.
Because the mesentery is a continuous tissue and possesses clear anatomical and functional properties, some researchers consider it to be a distinct organ.
