All-or-none law,   a physiological principle that relates response to stimulus in excitable tissues. It was first established for the contraction of heart muscle by the American physiologist Henry P. Bowditch in 1871. Describing the relation of response to stimulus, he stated, “An induction shock produces a contraction or fails to do so according to its strength; if it does so at all, it produces the greatest contraction that can be produced by any strength of stimulus in the condition of the muscle at the time.” It was believed that this law was peculiar to the heart and that the other highly specialized and rapidly responding tissues—skeletal muscle and nerve—responded in a different way, the intensity of response being graded according to the intensity of the stimulus. It has been established, however, that the individual fibres of both skeletal muscle and nerve respond to stimulation according to the all-or-none principle. This does not mean that the size of response is immutable, because functional capacity varies with the condition of the tissue, and the response to a stimulus applied during recovery from a previous response is subnormal. The size of response, however, is independent of the strength of stimulus, provided this be adequate. The functional response is essentially alike in these specialized tissues—heart, skeletal muscle, and nerve. The response resembles an explosive reaction in that it depletes for a time the available store of energy on which it depends.
