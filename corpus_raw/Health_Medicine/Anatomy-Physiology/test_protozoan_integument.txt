Test,   in zoology, a protective, loose-fitting shell secreted by some protozoans (especially foraminiferans and radiolarians). In most species the organic test contains inorganic materials that may be foreign objects (e.g., sand grains, shell fragments) or substances secreted by the organism (calcium carbonate or silica plates). Properties of the test (e.g., light transmitting qualities, wall structure) vary with test form.
Tests are diverse in structure and can include external ridges and spines and internal partitions, structural supports, wall laminations, and canal systems. Some tests have a single opening through which cytoplasm can emerge; others have several openings, and some are penetrated by small pores for cytoplasmic extensions. The taxonomy of the protozoan order Foraminiferida is based on the structure of the test, as is that of the ciliate order Tintinnida, in which the test is usually called a lorica (q.v.).
