Bioelectric organ, also called electric organ,  system of tissues specialized for the production and use of electrical power in a living organism. Well developed in a wide variety of fishes, both marine and freshwater, indicating an early evolutionary development, bioelectric organs probably represent a specialization of a common bioelectrical capacity of all living cells. (Various other tissues and organs also possess the capacity to produce electricity—the skin of frogs and the heart, brain, and eye of higher animals including humans.)
In more than 200 fish species, the bioelectric organ is involved in self-defense or hunting. The torpedo, or electric ray, and the electric eel have especially powerful electric organs, which they apparently use to immobilize or kill prey.
The electric eel has three pairs of electric organs; they constitute most of the mass of the body and about four-fifths of the total length of the fish. This fish is reputed to be able to generate a sufficiently powerful electric shock—600 to 1,000 volts at one ampere—to stun a human. Electric rays have two large, disk-shaped electric organs, one on each side of the body, that contribute to the disklike shape of the body.
The electric catfish of Africa, the knife fish of Latin America, and the stargazers probably use their bioelectric organs as sense organs in the detection of other fishes.
The basic element of an electric organ is a flattened cell called an electroplaque. Large numbers of electroplaques are arranged in series and in parallel to build up voltage and current-producing capacity of the electric organ.
Fishes deliver a sudden discharge of electricity by timing the nervous impulses that activate individual electroplaques, thereby providing simultaneous action of the entire array.
