Glycolysis, or glycolytic pathway or Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway,  sequence of 10 chemical reactions taking place in most cells that breaks down glucose, releasing energy that is then captured and stored in ATP. One molecule of glucose (plus coenzymes and inorganic phosphate) makes two molecules of pyruvate (or pyruvic acid) and two molecules of ATP. The pyruvate enters into the tricarboxylic acid cycle if enough oxygen is present or is fermented into lactic acid or ethanol if not. Thus, glycolysis produces both ATP for cellular energy requirements and building blocks for synthesis of other cellular products. See also Gustav Georg Embden; Otto Meyerhof.
