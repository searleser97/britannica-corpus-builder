Bowman’s capsule, also called Bowman capsule, glomerular capsule, renal corpuscular capsule, or capsular glomeruli,  double-walled cuplike structure that makes up part of the nephron, the filtration structure in the mammalian kidney that generates urine in the process of removing waste and excess substances from the blood. Bowman’s capsule encloses a cluster of microscopic blood vessels—capillaries—called the glomerulus, where wastes are filtered from the blood. Blood pressure forces plasma minus its macromolecules (e.g., proteins) from the glomerular capillaries into the Bowman’s capsule, which is continuous with the proximal convoluted tubule.
Bowman’s capsule and the glomerulus together constitute the renal corpuscle. Blood flows into and away from the glomerulus through tiny arteries called arterioles, which reach and leave the glomerulus through the open end of the capsule. In the renal corpuscle, fluid filters out of the blood in the glomerulus through the inner wall of the capsule and into the nephron tubule.
