Contractile vacuole,   regulatory organelle, usually spherical, found in freshwater protozoa and lower metazoans, such as sponges and hydras, that collects excess fluid from the protoplasm and periodically empties it into the surrounding medium. It may also excrete nitrogenous wastes. In amoebas it changes position with the animalâ€™s movement; in most ciliates it follows a definite path through the cell; in the Euglena and other flagellates it remains stationary. The filling and emptying cycle may last from seconds to a minute, depending on the species.
