Chemokine,  any of a group of small hormonelike molecules that are secreted by cells and that stimulate the movement of cells of the immune system toward specific sites in the body. Chemokines are a type of cytokine (a short-lived secreted protein that regulates the function of nearby cells) and may be described more specifically as chemotactic cytokines, because of their ability to cause certain cells in close proximity to undergo directed chemotaxis (cellular movement in response to chemical signals). Cells that respond to chemokines migrate along a chemical signal gradient that is marked by increasing chemokine concentration, such that the cells end up in areas with comparatively high chemokine levels. In this way, chemokines that are secreted by cells at sites of inflammation attract immune cells to those sites, thereby aiding the immune response.
Research on chemokines has helped advance medical understanding of human disease and the human immune system. Of particular importance has been research into the relationship between chemokines and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Certain chemokines appear to be able to control HIV infection, which suggests that they may be of value in the development of novel treatments for HIV.
