Planula, plural planulae,  free-swimming or crawling larval type common in many species of the phylum Cnidaria (e.g., jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones). The planula body is more or less cylindrical or egg-shaped and bears numerous cilia (tiny hairlike projections), which are used for locomotion. Planulae are produced by the polyp form in sea anemones and other anthozoans and by the medusa form in most other cnidarians. See also polyp (zoology); medusa.
