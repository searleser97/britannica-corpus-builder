Intestinal juice,  clear to pale yellow, watery secretion composed of hormones, digestive enzymes, mucus, and neutralizing substances released from the glands and mucous-membrane lining of the small and large intestines. Intestinal juice neutralizes hydrochloric acid coming from the stomach; releases gastrointestinal hormones into the bloodstream; and contains digestive enzymes that facilitate the digestion and absorption of food. Intestinal juice is secreted under the influence of hormones, the vagus nerve, and mechanical stimulation produced by the presence of food.
