Organogenesis,   in embryology, the series of organized integrated processes that transforms an amorphous mass of cells into a complete organ in the developing embryo. The cells of an organ-forming region undergo differential development and movement to form an organ primordium, or anlage. Organogenesis continues until the definitive characteristics of the organ are achieved. Concurrent with this process is histogenesis; the result of both processes is a structurally and functionally complete organ. The accomplishment of organogenesis ends the period during which the developing organism is called an embryo and begins the period in which the organism is called a fetus. See also histogenesis.
