Blood vessel,  a vessel in the human or animal body in which blood circulates. The vessels that carry blood away from the heart are called arteries, and their very small branches are arterioles. Very small branches that collect the blood from the various organs and parts are called venules, and they unite to form veins, which return the blood to the heart. Capillaries are minute thin-walled vessels that connect the arterioles and venules; it is through the capillaries that nutrients and wastes are exchanged between the blood and body tissues.
The inner surface of every blood vessel is lined by a thin layer of cells known as the endothelium. The endothelium is separated from the tough external layers of the vessel by the basal lamina, an extracellular matrix produced by surrounding epithelial cells. The endothelium plays a critical role in controlling the passage of substances, including nutrients and waste products, to and from the blood. Under certain circumstances, tissues may grow new blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. Angiogenesis plays an important role in the replacement of damaged tissue but also occurs under abnormal conditions, such as in tumour growth and progression.
In humans, the function and structure of blood vessels can be affected by a number of different diseases and conditions. Some examples include inflammation; atherosclerosis, which involves the deposition of fat in the arterial endothelium; and hypertension, in which narrowing of the arterioles causes an abnormal increase in blood pressure.
