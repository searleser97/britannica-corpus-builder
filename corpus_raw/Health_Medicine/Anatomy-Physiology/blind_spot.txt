Blind spot,  small portion of the visual field of each eye that corresponds to the position of the optic disk (also known as the optic nerve head) within the retina. There are no photoreceptors (i.e., rods or cones) in the optic disk, and, therefore, there is no image detection in this area. The blind spot of the right eye is located to the right of the centre of vision and vice versa in the left eye. With both eyes open, the blind spots are not perceived because the visual fields of the two eyes overlap. Indeed, even with one eye closed, the blind spot can be difficult to detect subjectively because of the ability of the brain to “fill in” or ignore the missing portion of the image.
The optic disk can be seen in the back of the eye with an ophthalmoscope. It is located on the nasal side of the macula lutea, is oval in shape, and is approximately 1.5 mm (0.06 inch) in diameter. It is also the entry point into the eye for major blood vessels that serve the retina. The optic disk represents the beginning of the optic nerve (second cranial nerve) and the point where axons from over one million retinal ganglion cells coalesce. Clinical evaluation of the optic nerve head is critical in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies that may lead to vision loss.
