Basophil,  type of white blood cell (leukocyte) that is characterized histologically by its ability to be stained by basic dyes and functionally by its role in mediating hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system. Basophils, along with eosinophils and neutrophils, constitute a group of white blood cells known as granulocytes.
Basophils are the least numerous of the granulocytes and account for less than 1 percent of all white blood cells occurring in the human body. Their large granules stain purple-black in colour and almost completely obscure the underlying double-lobed nucleus. Within hours of their release from the bone marrow, basophils migrate from the circulation to the barrier tissues (e.g., the skin and mucosa), where they synthesize and store histamine, a natural modulator of the inflammatory response. When antibodies of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) class bind to specialized receptor molecules on basophils, the cells release their stores of inflammatory chemicals, including histamine, serotonin, and leukotrienes. These chemicals have a number of effects, including constriction of the smooth muscles, which leads to breathing difficulty; dilation of blood vessels, causing skin flush and hives; and an increase in vascular permeability, resulting in swelling and a decrease in blood pressure. Basophils also incite immediate hypersensitivity reactions in association with platelets, macrophages, and neutrophils.
