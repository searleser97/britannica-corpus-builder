Adrenergic nerve fibre,  nerve fibre that releases the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the synapse, or junction, between a nerve and its end organ, which may be a muscle, gland, or another nerve. Adrenergic nerve fibres make up the sympathetic nervous system, one of two peripheral nervous systems controlling involuntary activities, such as digestion, respiration, and circulation.
Adrenergic fibres innervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, visceral glands, and various central nervous system structures and sense organs; their action is opposite to the inhibiting action of the cholinergic fibres of the parasympathetic system. Peripheral adrenergic neurons integrate signals from other nerves of the central nervous system and peripheral sense organs; an adrenergic nerve impulse is triggered when one nerve fires repeatedly or when several nerves fire simultaneously.
