Photoprotein,   in biochemistry, any of several proteins that give off light upon combination with oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or other oxidizing agents. Unlike the oxidation of luciferin, the production of light by a photoprotein requires no catalyst. Such a system occurs in Aequorea, a luminescent jellyfish, in which the single organic chemical aequorin requires calcium or strontium ions for luminescence to occur. See also bioluminescence.
