Radula, plural radulae, or radulas,  horny, ribbonlike structure found in the mouths of all mollusks except the bivalves. The radula, part of the odontophore, may be protruded, and it is used in drilling holes in prey or in rasping food particles from a surface. It is supported by a cartilage-like mass (the odontophore) and is covered with rows of many small teeth (denticles). New sections are constantly produced to replace teeth worn away at the front. The shape and arrangement of radular teeth are important tools in species identification.
