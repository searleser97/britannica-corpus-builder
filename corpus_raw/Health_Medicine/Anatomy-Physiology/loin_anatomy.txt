Loin,  that part of an animal lying between the upper part of the hipbone and the last of the false ribs on either side of the backbone—hence the butcher’s term for a piece of meat cut from that part of the body. The upper part of a loin of beef is known as the “surloin,” commonly corrupted into “sirloin.” In the plural the word is a term for the lower part of the human body at the junction with the legs. It is more or less synonymous with flank, or that portion of the body bounded by the lower ribs, the backbone, and the pelvis.
