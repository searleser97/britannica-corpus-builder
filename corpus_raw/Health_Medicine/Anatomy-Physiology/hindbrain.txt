Hindbrain, also called rhombencephalon,   region of the developing vertebrate brain that is composed of the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the cerebellum. The hindbrain coordinates functions that are fundamental to survival, including respiratory rhythm, motor activity, sleep, and wakefulness. It is one of the three major developmental divisions of the brain; the other two are the midbrain and forebrain.
Each of the three different regions of the hindbrain helps coordinate specific functions and activities. The medulla transmits signals between the spinal cord and the higher parts of the brain; it also controls autonomic functions such as heartbeat and respiration. The pons is partly made up of tracts that connect the spinal cord with higher brain levels, and it also contains cell groups that transfer information from the cerebrum to the cerebellum. Some of those cell groups are part of the reticular formation, a network of neurons extending throughout the brainstem that regulates alertness, sleep, and wakefulness. The medulla likewise houses a portion of the reticular formation.
The third area of the hindbrain, the cerebellum, is enriched with Purkinje cells and granule cells. Purkinje cells are large neurons that serve a critical role in coordinating motor activity. Granule cells, in contrast, are very small neurons; their function is unclear, though they are thought to have an important role in motor learning.
