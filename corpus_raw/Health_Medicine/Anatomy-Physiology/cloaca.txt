Cloaca,   (Latin: “sewer”), in vertebrates, common chamber and outlet into which the intestinal, urinary, and genital tracts open. It is present in amphibians, reptiles, birds, elasmobranch fishes (such as sharks), and monotremes. A cloaca is not present in placental mammals or in most bony fishes. Certain animals have, within the cloaca, an accessory organ (penis) that is used to direct the sperm into the female’s cloaca. This structure occurs in many reptiles and in a few birds, including ducks. Most birds, however, mate by joining their cloacas in a “cloacal kiss”; muscular contractions transfer the sperm from the male to female.
