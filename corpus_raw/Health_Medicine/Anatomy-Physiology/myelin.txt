Myelin,  white, insulating sheath on the axon of many neurons. Composed of fatty materials, protein, and water, the myelin sheath is deposited in layers around axons by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system and by a type of neuroglia called an oligodendrocyte in the central nervous system. The sheath is interrupted at intervals by gaps called nodes of Ranvier; this structure speeds nerve conduction, as impulses jump from node to node in a process known as saltatory conduction.
