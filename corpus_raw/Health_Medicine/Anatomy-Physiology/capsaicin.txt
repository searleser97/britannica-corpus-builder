Capsaicin, also spelled capsaicine,  the most abundant of the pungent principles of the red pepper (Capsicum). It is an organic nitrogen compound belonging to the lipid group, but it is often erroneously classed among the alkaloids, a family of nitrogenous compounds with marked physiological effects.
The name capsaicin was applied to a colourless, crystalline substance first isolated from capsicum oleoresin in 1876 and considered a single compound until about 1960. During the 1960s the natural product was found to contain small amounts of other compounds very similar to the one for which the name capsaicin had become established.
