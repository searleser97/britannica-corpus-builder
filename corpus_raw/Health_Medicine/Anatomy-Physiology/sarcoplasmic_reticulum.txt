Sarcoplasmic reticulum,  intracellular system of closed saclike membranes involved in the storage of intracellular calcium in striated (skeletal) muscle cells. Each segment of the sarcoplasmic reticulum forms a cufflike structure surrounding a myofibril, the fine contractile fibres that extend the length of striated muscle cells. By regulating the concentration of calcium in the sarcoplasm (the cytoplasm of striated muscle cells), the sarcoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in determining whether muscle contraction occurs.
In cardiac muscle cells, calcium is an important effector of the coupling between cardiac depolarization (excitation) and cardiac contraction (called “excitation-contraction coupling”). In these cells, the sarcoplasmic reticulum sequesters calcium ions and thereby maintains low calcium concentrations in the sarcoplasm. Upon excitation and depolarization of the cell, the calcium channel opens and admits a small amount of calcium associated with the shift in the membrane potential. This small amount of calcium stimulates the release of additional calcium from calcium-sensitive channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing the cellular calcium concentration to rise by nearly 100-fold. When the heart is repolarized, the sarcoplasmic reticulum reabsorbs the excess calcium, and the cellular calcium concentration returns to its formerly low level, letting the heart muscle relax.
Reabsorption of cellular calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is important because it prevents the development of muscle tension. In the resting state, two proteins, troponin and tropomyosin, bind to actin molecules and inhibit interaction between actin and myosin, thereby blocking muscle contraction. When calcium concentration increases during depolarization, it shifts the conformation of troponin and tropomyosin, and actin is able to associate with myosin. As calcium is taken up again by the sarcoplasmic reticulum the muscle cell relaxes.
