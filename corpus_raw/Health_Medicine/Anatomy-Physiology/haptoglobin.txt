Haptoglobin,   a colourless protein of the α-globulin fraction of human serum (liquid portion of blood plasma after the clotting factor fibrinogen has been removed) that transports hemoglobin freed from destroyed red blood cells to the reticuloendothelial system, where it is broken down. Three common types—numbered 1-1, 2-1, and 2-2—and three uncommon types of haptoglobin are known and are believed to result from combinations among three alleles (forms of genes). The serum haptoglobin level is raised during inflammations and certain other conditions; it is lowered in hemolytic disease and some types of liver disease.
