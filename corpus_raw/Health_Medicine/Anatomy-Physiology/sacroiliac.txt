Sacroiliac,   weight-bearing synovial joint that articulates, or connects, the hip bone with the the sacrum at the base of the spinal column. Strong ligaments around the joint help to stabilize it in supporting the weight of the upper body; the joint’s motion is also limited by the irregular surfaces of the sacrum (the fused vertebrae of the lower spine), which closely articulate with the ilium (the uppermost of the three bones composing each half of the pelvis). The sacroiliac’s movement is consequently very slight or none at all. The joint is, in effect, narrow vertical slits on the left and right sides of the sacrum where it connects with the ilium bones. The space between the sacrum and the hip bone is occupied by a small cavity filled with synovial fluid (which cushions the joint against pressure) and by a fibrous mass of strong cartilage.
The most common diseases affecting the sacroiliac are degenerative processes such as arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. Most adults, especially men, have some sacroiliac deterioration; with advanced age, the joint may be greatly reduced or nonexistent. Hormones produced during pregnancy soften and loosen the pelvic ligaments in women to allow stretching during childbirth and may delay the degeneration somewhat.
