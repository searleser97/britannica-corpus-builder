Nail,  in the anatomy of humans and other primates, horny plate that grows on the back of each finger and toe at its outer end. It corresponds to the claw, hoof, or talon of other vertebrates. The nail is a platelike, keratinous, translucent structure that consists of highly specialized epithelial cells. The nail grows from a deep groove in the dermis of the skin. All nail growth occurs at the nail’s base, where the specialized cells that make up the nail’s plate are produced; these cells are pushed forward as new cells form behind them. The nail plate is also attached to the underlying, richly vascularized nail bed, which supplies the plate with necessary nutrients. The cells at the front edge of the nail plate die and turn white as they lose contact with the nail bed. The whitish, crescent-moon-shaped part of the nail, known as the lunula, is also not attached to the underlying nail bed. The nail’s chief function is to protect the terminal portions of the toes and fingers. On the fingers, the front edge of the nail assists in the manipulation of small objects, as well as in scratching.
