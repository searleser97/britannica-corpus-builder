Plasma cell,  short-lived antibody-producing cell derived from a type of leukocyte (white blood cell) called a B cell. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibody molecules closely modeled after the receptors of the precursor B cell. Once released into the blood and lymph, these antibody molecules bind to the target antigen (foreign substance) and initiate its neutralization or destruction. Antibody production continues for several days or months, until the antigen has been overcome.
Each plasma cell can secrete several thousand molecules of antibody, thus releasing a large amount of antibody into the circulation. The initial burst of antibody production gradually decreases as the stimulus is removed (e.g., by recovery from infection).
