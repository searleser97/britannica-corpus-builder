Corpus callosum,  bundle of nerve fibres in the longitudinal fissure of the brain that enables corresponding regions of the left and right cerebral hemispheres to communicate. The axons and dendrites of the neurons in the corpus callosum synapse with cortical neurons on symmetrically related points of the hemispheres. Thus, electrical stimulation of a point on one hemisphere usually gives rise to a response on a symmetrically related point on the other, by virtue of these callosal connections. The neurons in the corpus callosum also are insulated by a myelin sheath, which facilitates the rapid conduction of electrical impulses between the hemispheres.
Diseases affecting the corpus callosum include Marchiafava-Bignami disease, which is characterized by progressive demyelination of the neurons of the corpus callosum. In addition, agenesis (imperfect development) of the corpus callosum can cause intellectual disability and seizures. A reduced amount of tissue in the corpus callosum also has been associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
The corpus callosum has played an important role in the elucidation of functions specific to each of the cerebral hemispheres. For example, studies of individuals being treated for epilepsy in whom the corpus callosum has been severed, allowing the two hemispheres to function largely independently, have revealed that the right hemisphere has more language competence than was thought.
