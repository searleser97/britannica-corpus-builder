Antithrombin (AT), also called antithrombin III or ATIII,  an anticlotting substance occurring in the plasma of blood that functions primarily to block the action of thrombin, an enzyme central to coagulationâ€”the process by which a clot is formed. AT combines with thrombin as well as most of the other activated blood-clotting proteins (e.g., factors Xa and IXa) to form inert complexes. This action is greatly enhanced by the presence of heparin, a substance formed by mast cells of the connective tissue.
Hereditary AT deficiency is associated with an excessive tendency toward clot formation, and manifestations of this defect are recurrent thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolism.
