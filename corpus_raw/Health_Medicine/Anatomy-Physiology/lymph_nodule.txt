Lymph nodule,   small, localized collection of lymphoid tissue, usually located in the loose connective tissue beneath wet epithelial (covering or lining) membranes, as in the digestive system, respiratory system, and urinary bladder. Lymph nodules form in regions of frequent exposure to microorganisms or foreign materials and contribute to the defense against them. The nodule differs from a lymph node in that it is much smaller and does not have a well-defined connective-tissue capsule as a boundary. It also does not function as a filter, because it is not located along a lymphatic vessel. Lymph nodules frequently contain germinal centres—sites for localized production of lymphocytes. In the small intestine, collections of lymph nodules are called Peyer’s patches. The tonsils are also local regions where the nodules have merged together.
