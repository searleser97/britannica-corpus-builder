P blood group system,  classification of human blood based on the presence of any of three substances known as the P, P1, and Pk antigens on the surfaces of red blood cells. These antigens are also expressed on the surfaces of cells lining the urinary tract, where they have been identified as adhesion sites for Escherichia coli bacteria, which cause urinary tract infections.
The P blood group, which was discovered in 1927, consists of alleles designated P, P1, and Pk. The P and P1 antigens are produced by a gene known as B3GALNT1 (beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1), whereas the Pk antigen is produced by a gene called A4GALT (alpha 1,4-galactosyltransferase).
There are five phenotypes in the P blood group system: P1, P2, P1k, P2k, and p, formerly designated Tj(aâˆ’). The most commonly occurring of these is the P1 phenotype, which displays all three P antigens. The P2 phenotype consists of the P and Pk antigens and is the second most common phenotype in the P system, whereas the phenotypes P1k (P1 and Pk antigens), P2k (Pk antigen only), and p (no antigens) are extremely uncommon.
Antibodies against P, P1, and Pk antigens can cause transfusion reactions, and antibodies against P and Pk antigens may cause severe erythroblastosis fetalis or spontaneous abortion.
