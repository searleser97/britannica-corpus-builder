Achilles tendon, also called calcaneal tendon,  strong tendon at the back of the heel that connects the calf muscles to the heel. The tendon is formed from the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (the calf muscles) and is inserted into the heel bone. The contracting calf muscles lift the heel by this tendon, thus producing a foot action that is basic to walking, running, and jumping. The Achilles tendon is the thickest and most powerful tendon in the body.
The Achilles tendon is vulnerable to tendonitis, tear, and rupture. Microtears, which may be caused by acute injury or by chronic strain, produce pain and swelling. If the tendon is completely torn, or ruptured, use of the leg for running and jumping is lost for an extended period of time. Tendon ruptures frequently require surgery and immobolization of the ankle for weeks or months. Tendonitis is characterized by inflammation of the tendon, with stiffness and pain. Healing is possible after weeks of rest from physical activity.
The tendon is named after the ancient Greek mythological figure Achilles because it lies at the only part of his body that was still vulnerable after his mother had dipped him (holding him by the heel) into the River Styx.
