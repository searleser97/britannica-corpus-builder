Extensor muscle,   any of the muscles that increase the angle between members of a limb, as by straightening the elbow or knee or bending the wrist or spine backward. The movement is usually directed backward, with the notable exception of the knee joint. In humans, certain muscles of the hand and foot are named for this function. In the hand these include the extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor carpi radialis longus, and extensor carpi ulnaris, which run from the humerus (bone of the upper arm) along the back of the forearm to the metacarpal bones at the back of the hand and which extend the wrist; the extensor digitorum, which runs from the humerus to a common tendon attached to all of the fingers and which extends the fingers; the extensor indicis, which acts upon the index finger; and the extensor pollicis brevis and extensor pollicis longus, which run from the radius and ulna (bones of the forearm), respectively, and act upon the thumb.
Extensors in the foot include the extensor digitorum longus and extensor digitorum brevis, which originate at the upper and lower parts of the lower leg and act through long tendons upon the toes, and the extensor hallucis brevis and extensor hallucis longus, which act upon the great toe. The longus muscles of the foot also aid upward flexion of the foot at the ankle. Compare flexor muscle.
