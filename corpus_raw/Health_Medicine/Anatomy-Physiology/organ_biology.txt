Organ,  in biology, a group of tissues in a living organism that have been adapted to perform a specific function. In higher animals, organs are grouped into organ systems; e.g., the esophagus, stomach, and liver are organs of the digestive system.
In the more advanced animals, there are usually 10 organ systems: integumentary, skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine (hormonal), digestive, respiratory, circulatory, excretory, and reproductive. These systems appear gradually in the lower animals and attain their full complexity and functional specialization in the higher animals. In plants the primary organs are the stem, root, and leaf, all of which help to nourish the plant, and the reproductive organs (e.g., flowers, seed, and spores). As with animals, these organs are responsible for the basic life-sustaining functions of the organism.
