Semispinalis muscle,   any of the deep muscles just to either side of the spine that arise from the transverse processes (side projections) of the lower vertebrae and reach upward across several vertebrae to insert at the spines of vertebrae farther up, except for the upper segment (semispinalis capitis), which inserts at the occipital bone of the skull. The lower and middle segments (semispinalis dorsi and semispinalis cervicis) help extend (bend backward) and rotate the spinal column; the upper segment also helps bend the head backward.
