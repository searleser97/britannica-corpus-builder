Thermoregulation, also called Heat Regulation,  the maintenance of an optimum temperature range by an organism. Cold-blooded animals (poikilotherms) pick up or lose heat by way of the environment, moving from one place to another as necessary. Warm-blooded animals (homoiotherms) have additional means by which they can heat and cool their bodies. Muscular activity can be an important source of heat in both kinds of animals. See thermoreception.
