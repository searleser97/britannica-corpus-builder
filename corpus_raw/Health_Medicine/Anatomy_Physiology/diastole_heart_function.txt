Diastole,   in the cardiac cycle, period of relaxation of the heart muscle, accompanied by the filling of the chambers with blood. Diastole is followed in the cardiac cycle by a period of contraction, or systole (q.v.), of the heart muscle. Initially both atria and ventricles are in diastole, and there is a period of rapid filling of the ventricles followed by a brief atrial systole. At the same time, there is a corresponding decrease in arterial blood pressure to its minimum (diastolic blood pressure), normally about 80 mm of mercury in humans. Ventricular diastole again occurs after the blood has been ejected (during ventricular systole) into the aorta and pulmonary artery.
Diastole may also refer to relaxation of contractile vacuoles in protozoa. See also blood pressure.
