Neurosecretory cell,  a type of neuron, or nerve cell, whose function is to translate neural signals into chemical stimuli. Such cells produce secretions called neurohormones that travel along the neuron axon and are typically released into the bloodstream at neurohemal organs, regions in which the axon endings are in close contact with blood capillaries. Neurosecretory cells are present in most multicellular animals and are usually distinguished from other neurons by the unusually large size of the cell nucleus, axon endings, and the cell itself.
