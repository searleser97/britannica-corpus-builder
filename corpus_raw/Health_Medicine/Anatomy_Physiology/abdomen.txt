Abdomen,  in human anatomy, the body cavity lying between the chest or thorax above and the pelvis below and from the spine in the back to the wall of abdominal muscles in the front. The diaphragm is its upper boundary. There is no wall or clear-cut boundary between it and the pelvis. It contains organs of digestion and the spleen, which are surrounded by a serous membrane, the peritoneum.
