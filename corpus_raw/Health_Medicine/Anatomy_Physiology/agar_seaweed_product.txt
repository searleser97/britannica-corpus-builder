Agar, also called agar-agar,  gelatin-like product made primarily from the red algae Gelidium and Gracilaria (division Rhodophyta). Best known as a solidifying component of bacteriological culture media, it is also used in canning meat, fish, and poultry; in cosmetics, medicines, and dentistry; as a clarifying agent in brewing and wine making; as a thickening agent in ice cream, pastries, desserts, and salad dressings; and as a wire-drawing lubricant. Agar is isolated from the algae as an amorphous and translucent product sold as powder, flakes, or bricks.
Although agar is insoluble in cold water, it absorbs as much as 20 times its own weight. It dissolves readily in boiling water; a dilute solution is still liquid at 42 째C (108 째F) but solidifies at 37 째C (99 째F) into a firm gel. In its natural state, agar occurs as a complex cell-wall constituent containing the polysaccharide agarose with sulfate and calcium.
