Sinusoid,   irregular tubular space for the passage of blood, taking the place of capillaries and venules in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The sinusoids form from branches of the portal vein in the liver and from arterioles (minute arteries) in other organs. The walls of the sinusoids are lined with phagocytic cells, called Kupffer cells, that digest old red blood cells and clear the bloodstream of toxins.
In the liver, blood enters the hepatic sinusoids from both the portal vein (q.v.) and the hepatic artery; the venous blood is cleansed in the sinusoids, while the arterial blood provides oxygen to the surrounding liver cells. Blood then passes from the sinusoids into the hepatic vein for return to the heart.
