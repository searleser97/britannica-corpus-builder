Relaxin,  in common usage, the two-chain peptide hormone H2 relaxin, which belongs to the relaxin peptide family in the insulin superfamily of hormones. The relaxin peptide family includes six other related hormones: the insulin-like peptides H1 relaxin, INSL3, INSL4, INSL5, INSL6, and INSL7 (also known as H3 relaxin). H1 relaxin is found only in higher primates, including humans, whereas H2 relaxin is found in most vertebrates (higher primates included). H3 relaxin is thought to be the ancestral form of the hormone.
Relaxin was discovered in 1926 in pregnant guinea pigs. It was shown to cause the pelvic ligaments to relax, allowing the body to accommodate the strain of pregnancy and ease the passage of offspring through the birth canal. The hormone was later demonstrated to have a role in the softening, or ripening, of the cervix through collagen remodeling, allowing for smooth parturition. Relaxin is produced in the corpus luteum, the placenta, and the uterus in females, as well as in other reproductive structures; this varies by species. Relaxin also promotes the development of the nipples and mammary glands in pregnant mammals. Because of these effects, relaxin was initially thought to serve only as a pregnancy hormone.
However, later research determined that relaxin is pleiotropic; that is, it is active in numerous physiological processes. It is produced by the prostate gland in males and is known to have effects on the mobility of sperm cells. Its role in male reproduction is not fully understood. Relaxin has also been implicated in vasodilation, regulation of the secretion of other hormones, kidney function, and the remodeling of collagen in areas of the body besides the reproductive tract. This broader understanding of relaxin spurred investigation of its suitability as a therapeutic agent for a wide variety of conditions. It was used with some success to treat the fibrotic skin disorder scleroderma.
