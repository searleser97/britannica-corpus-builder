Systemic circulation,   in physiology, the circuit of vessels supplying oxygenated blood to and returning deoxygenated blood from the tissues of the body, as distinguished from the pulmonary circulation. Blood is pumped from the left ventricle of the heart through the aorta and arterial branches to the arterioles and through capillaries, where it reaches an equilibrium with the tissue fluid, and then drains through the venules into the veins and returns, via the venae cavae, to the right atrium of the heart. Pressure in the arterial system, resulting from heart action and distension by the blood, maintains systemic blood flow. The systemic pathway, however, consists of many circuits in parallel, each of which has its own arteriolar resistance that determines blood flow independently of the overall flow and pressure and without necessarily disrupting these. For example, the blood flow through the digestive tract increases after meals, and that through working muscles increases during exercise. See also pulmonary circulation.
