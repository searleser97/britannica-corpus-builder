Galactorrhea,   excessive flow of milk from the breast, or lactation that is not associated with childbirth or nursing. The abnormal production of milk in women is usually due to excessive levels of estrogen in the body or to excessive production of prolactin, a hormone that is manufactured by the pituitary gland and that stimulates the production of milk. Galactorrhea may also be caused by a tumour or other disorder occurring in the pituitary gland. The milk of a nursing mother who has galactorrhea may be watery, whitish green in colour, and of poor quality.
In women, persistent lactation without suckling, which follows upon a recent pregnancy, is called the Chiari–Frommel syndrome. Galactorrhea in a woman who has never been pregnant is termed the Ahumada–del Castillo, or the Argonz–del Castillo, syndrome. Such galactorrhea appears to result from excesses of secretion from the pituitary eosinophils.
Galactorrhea in women has been reported from a wide variety of other causes, including encephalitis, pituitary stalk section, various surgical procedures, pneumoencephalography, and chlorpromazine, reserpine, birth-control pill, progesterone, or other drug therapies.
Therapy for galactorrhea includes removal of the cause, when it is known, and regulation of the patient’s estrogen and progesterone production.
