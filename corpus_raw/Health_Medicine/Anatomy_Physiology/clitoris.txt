Clitoris,   female erogenous organ capable of erection under sexual stimulation. A female homologue of the male penis, the clitoris develops (as does the penis) from the genital tubercle of the fetus, and it plays an important role in female sexual response.
The body of the clitoris is suspended from the pubic bone by a short ligament and emerges to form a tiny external glans at the top of the vulva. Lying over the glans is a sheath of skin known as the clitoral hood. The glans has a generous supply of sensitive nerve endings, which account for the clitorisâ€™ central role in tactile sexual stimulation.
Extending internally from the glans is the shaft, or body, of the clitoris, a small cylinder about 2 to 3 cm (about 0.8 to 1.2 inches) long. From the body extend the erectile corpora cavernosa and bulbs. The corpora cavernosa and bulbs are continuous with two relatively long structures known as the crura, which are made up of nonerectile tissue. The body, crura, corpora cavernosa, and bulbs together are shaped like a wishbone, with the latter three tissues forming the arms of the wishbone, which hug the urethra and vagina. During sexual excitement, the corpora cavernosa and bulbs become engorged with blood, causing erection.
