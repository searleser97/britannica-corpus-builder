constipation,  delayed passage of waste through the lower portion of the large intestine, with the possible discharge of relatively dry, hardened feces from the anus. Among the causes cited for the disorder are lack of regularity in one’s eating habits, spasms of the large intestine, metabolic diseases such as hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus, neurological disorders such as a stroke, certain medications including morphine, codeine, antidepressants, and antispasmodics, lack of sufficient fibre in one’s food, and excessive use of laxatives. Constipation may also be caused by intestinal obstruction by tumours or polyps or by weakness of the abdominal muscles. Temporary constipation most often occurs in conjunction with a change or interruption in one’s usual activities, as in travel, temporary confinement to bed, or a change in eating or sleeping habits. In most cases, dietary and lifestyle changes can help relieve constipation.
