Postsynaptic potential (PSP),  a temporary change in the electric polarization of the membrane of a nerve cell (neuron). The result of chemical transmission of a nerve impulse at the synapse (neuronal junction), the postsynaptic potential can lead to the firing of a new impulse.
When an impulse arrives at a synapse from an activated neuron (presynaptic neuron), a chemical substance called a neurotransmitter is released causing the opening of channel-shaped molecules in the membrane of the resting neuron (postsynaptic neuron). Ions flowing through the channels create a shift in the resting membrane polarization, which usually has a slightly more negative charge inside the neuron than outside. Hyperpolarization—that is, an increase in negative charge on the inside of the neuron—constitutes an inhibitory PSP, because it inhibits the neuron from firing an impulse. Depolarization—a decrease in negative charge—constitutes an excitatory PSP because, if the neuron reaches the critical threshold potential, it can excite the generation of a nerve impulse (action potential).
The PSP is a graded potential; that is, its degree of hyperpolarization or depolarization varies according to the activation of ion channels. The ability to integrate multiple PSPs at multiple synapses is an important property of neurons and is called summation. Summation may be either spatial, in which signals are received from many synapses at once, or temporal, in which successive signals are received from the same synapse. Spatial and temporal summation can occur simultaneously.
The equivalent of the PSP at nerve-muscle synapses is called the end-plate potential.
