Parasympathetic nervous system,  division of the nervous system that primarily modulates visceral organs such as glands. The parasympathetic system is one of two antagonistic sets of nerves of the autonomic nervous system; the other set comprises the sympathetic nervous system. While providing important control of many tissues, the parasympathetic system is not crucial for the maintenance of lifeâ€”unlike the sympathetic system, which activates the so-called fight-or-flight response. The nerve fibres of the parasympathetic nervous system are the cranial nerves, primarily the vagus nerve, and the lumbar spinal nerves. When stimulated, these nerves increase digestive secretions and reduce the heartbeat.
The parasympathetic nervous system is organized in a manner similar to the sympathetic nervous system. Its motor component consists of preganglionic and postganglionic neurons. The preganglionic neurons are located in specific cell groups (also called nuclei) in the brainstem or in the lateral horns of the spinal cord at sacral levels. Preganglionic axons emerging from the brainstem project to parasympathetic ganglia that are located in the head or near the heart, are embedded in the end organ itself (e.g., the trachea, bronchi, and gastrointestinal tract), or are situated a short distance from the urinary bladder. Both pre- and postganglionic neurons secrete acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter, but, like sympathetic ganglion cells, they also contain other neuroactive chemical agents that function as cotransmitters.
Examples of secretory glands that are under parasympathetic control include the lacrimal gland, which supplies tears to the cornea of the eye; the salivary glands, which produce saliva; and the nasal mucous glands, which secrete mucus throughout the nasal air passages.
