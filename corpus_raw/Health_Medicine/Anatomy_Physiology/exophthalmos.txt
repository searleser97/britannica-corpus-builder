Exophthalmos, also spelled exophthalmus, also called proptosis,  abnormal protrusion of one or both eyeballs. The most common cause for unilateral or bilateral exophthalmos is thyroid eye disease, or Graves ophthalmopathy. The proptosis arises from inflammation, cellular proliferation, and accumulation of fluid in the tissues that surround the eyeball in its socket, or orbit. The vast majority of people with Graves ophthalmopathy also have (or will later develop) thyroid dysfunction. Other causes of exophthalmos include other orbital inflammatory conditions, spread of infection from the paranasal sinuses or teeth, trauma, various orbital tumours, and vascular (blood vessel) abnormalities of the orbit. It should also be noted that “prominent” eyes can be a normal inherited trait in certain families.
Exophthalmos often leads to increased exposure of the eye surface, which can produce irritation and redness. Other symptoms or findings that can coincide with exophthalmos include eyelid swelling or retraction, deep orbital pain, and double vision. In severe cases, vision can be threatened from exposure-induced cornea damage or compression of the optic nerve within the orbit. Treatment of symptomatic exophthalmos is directed at correcting any underlying disorders (e.g., hyperthyroidism), as well as providing lubrication of the eye surface, if necessary. Persistent exophthalmos from Graves ophthalmopathy can be managed with medication, surgery, or radiation therapy. Vision loss or vision-threatening changes associated with exophthalmos require prompt intervention.
