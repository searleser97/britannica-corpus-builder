Neuroglia, also called glial cell or glia,  any of several types of cell that function primarily to support neurons. The term neuroglia means “nerve glue.” In 1907 Italian biologist Emilio Lugaro suggested that neuroglial cells exchange substances with the extracellular fluid and in this way exert control on the neuronal environment. It has since been shown that glucose, amino acids, and ions—all of which influence neuronal function—are exchanged between the extracellular space and neuroglial cells. For instance, after high levels of neuronal activity neuroglial cells can take up and spatially buffer potassium ions and thus maintain normal neuronal function.
Neuroglia exceed the number of neurons in the nervous system by at least 10 to 1. Neuroglia exist in the nervous systems of invertebrates as well as vertebrates and can be distinguished from neurons by their lack of axons and by the presence of only one type of process. In addition, they do not form synapses, and they retain the ability to divide throughout their life span. While neurons and neuroglia lie in close apposition to one another, there are no direct junctional specializations, such as gap junctions, between the two types. Gap junctions do exist between neuroglial cells.
Apart from conventional histological and electron-microscopic techniques, immunologic techniques are used to identify different neuroglial cell types. By staining the cells with antibodies that bind to specific protein constituents of different neuroglia, neurologists have been able to discern four groups of neuroglia: (1) astrocytes, subdivided into fibrous and protoplasmic types, (2) oligodendrocytes, subdivided into interfascicular and perineuronal types, (3) microglia, and (4) ependymal cells.
