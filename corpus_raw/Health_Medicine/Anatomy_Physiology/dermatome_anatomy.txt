Dermatome,  the outer portion of an embryo from which the skin and subcutaneous tissues are developed and, postnatally, the areas of skin supplied by the branches of a single dorsal root ganglion (a dense group of nerve-cell bodies). In the developing embryo the dermatome arises from one of the three segments (somites) of the mesoderm, the middle layer of embryonic tissue.
Dermatomes are arranged with considerable regularity in the vertebrate trunk, although there is some overlap with similar areas above and below. Because each dermatomic area of skin is innervated by branches of nerves originating from a single dorsal root ganglion, the loss of sensation in an area of skin can be traced to a specific spinal nerve, facilitating the diagnosis of spinal cord injuries and certain neurological diseases.
