Renal artery,   one of the pair of large blood vessels that branch off from the abdominal aorta (the abdominal portion of the major artery leading from the heart) and enter into each kidney. (The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that remove waste substances from the blood and aid in fluid conservation and in stabilization of the chemical composition of the blood.) At the inner concavity of each kidney there is an opening, known as the hilum, through which the renal artery passes. After passing through the hilum, the renal artery divides ordinarily into two large branches, and each branch divides into a number of smaller arteries, which bring blood to the nephrons, the functioning units of the kidney. Blood that has been processed by the nephrons ultimately reaches the renal vein, which carries it back to the inferior vena cava and to the right side of the heart.
The renal arteries deliver to the kidneys of a normal person at rest 1.2 litres of blood per minute, a volume equivalent to approximately one-quarter of the heartâ€™s output. Thus, a volume of blood equal to all that found in the body of an adult human being is processed by the kidneys once every four to five minutes. Although some physical conditions can inhibit blood flow, there are certain self-regulatory mechanisms inherent to the arteries of the kidney that allow some adaptation to stress. When the total body blood pressure rises or drops, sensory receptors of the nervous system located in the smooth muscle wall of the arteries are affected by the pressure changes, and, to compensate for the blood pressure variations, the arteries either expand or contract to keep a constant volume of blood flow.
