Inulin,   polysaccharide that is a commercial source of the sugar fructose. It occurs in many plants of the family Asteraceae (Compositae), particularly in such roots and tubers as the dahlia and the Jerusalem artichoke. Inulin forms a white, crystalline powder that is as sweet as sucrose. The inulin molecule is a small, inert polysaccharide that readily passes through the digestive system and remains neutral to cellular activity. Because it is not absorbed by the body, it is used to sweeten foods consumed by diabetic patients.
