Sago,  food starch prepared from carbohydrate material stored in the trunks of several palms, the main source being the true sago palm, Metroxylon sagu, which is,  native to the Indonesian archipelago. In Indonesia, sago forests are especially extensive on Seram Island. Borneo produces much of the sago imported into Europe.
Sago palms grow in low marshy areas, usually reaching a height of nearly 9 metres (30 feet) and developing thick trunks. The plant matures in 15 years, producing an inflorescence, or flower spike, and the pith, or central portion, of the stem becomes gorged with starchy material. When fruit is allowed to form and ripen, it absorbs the starch, leaving the stem hollow, and the tree dies after the fruit ripens.
Cultivated plants are cut down when the flower spike appears, and their stems are divided into sections and split open so that the starchy pith may be extracted. The extracted material is grated to make a powder, which is kneaded with water over a strainer, through which the starch passes into a trough below, leaving any woody fibre behind. After several washings, the resulting sago meal is ready for local use. When prepared for export, sago meal is mixed with water to form a paste and rubbed through sieves of various sizes, producing grains sold as pearl or bullet sago, depending upon their size.
Sago is almost pure starch, being composed of 88 percent carbohydrate, 0.5 percent protein, and minute amounts of fat, and contains only a trace of B vitamins. It is a basic food of the southwest Pacific area, where it is used in meal form to prepare soups, cakes, and puddings. Elsewhere its use in cookery is mainly as a pudding and sauce thickener. In industry it is used as a textile stiffener.
In the Pacific region another palm that is used as a source  of sago is the cycad sago (Cycas revoluta); extracts of the cycad sago must go through additional processing to remove the neurotoxin cycasin. Sago may also be extracted from cassava root.
