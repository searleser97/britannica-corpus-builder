Neuromuscular junction, also called myoneural junction,  site of chemical communication between a nerve fibre and a muscle cell. The neuromuscular junction is analogous to the synapse between two neurons. A nerve fibre divides into many terminal branches; each terminal ends on a region of muscle fibre called the end plate. Embedded in the end plate are thousands of receptors, which are long protein molecules that form channels through the membrane. Upon stimulation by a nerve impulse, the terminal releases the chemical neurotransmitter acetylcholine from synaptic vesicles. Acetylcholine then binds to the receptors, the channels open, and sodium ions flow into the end plate. This initiates the end-plate potential, the electrical event that leads to contraction of the muscle fibre.
