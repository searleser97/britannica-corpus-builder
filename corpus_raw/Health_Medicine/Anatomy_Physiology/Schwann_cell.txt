Schwann cell, also called neurilemma cell,    any of the cells in the peripheral nervous system that produce the myelin sheath around neuronal axons. Schwann cells are named after German physiologist Theodor Schwann, who discovered them in the 19th century. These cells are equivalent to a type of neuroglia called oligodendrocytes, which occur in the central nervous system.
Schwann cells differentiate from cells of the neural crest during embryonic development, and they are stimulated to proliferate by some constituent of the axonal surface. When motor neurons are severed, causing nerve terminals to degenerate, Schwann cells occupy the original neuronal space. The process of degeneration is followed by regeneration; fibres regenerate in such a way that they return to their original target sites. Schwann cells that remain after nerve degeneration apparently determine the route.
Demyelinating neuropathies are those in which the Schwann cells are primarily affected and migrate away from the nerve. This process causes the insulating myelin of axon segments to be lost, and conduction of nerve impulses down the axon is blocked. Schwann cells may suffer immune or toxic attack, as in Guillain-Barré syndrome and diphtheria. This also leads to a blockage of electrical conduction. When an injury is primarily to axons, the Schwann cells are also damaged, producing “secondary demyelination.”
