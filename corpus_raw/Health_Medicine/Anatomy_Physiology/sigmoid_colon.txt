Sigmoid colon,  a terminal section of the large intestine that connects the descending colon to the rectum; its function is to store fecal wastes until they are ready to leave the body. The sigmoid colon derives its name from the fact that it is curved in the form of an S (Greek sigma: σ). Its size depends upon the amount of waste material in it, but when contracted its diameter is only about one inch (2.5 centimetres).
The internal surface of the sigmoid colon is similar to that of the rest of the large intestine. The smooth mucous membrane lining secretes mucus and enzymes, and the lining’s surface cells can absorb fluids. Most of these activities occur, however, higher up in the intestinal tract. The deeper muscle layer of the sigmoid colon is composed of circular muscles and a sheath of longitudinal muscles. Both help move waste material within the colon, but the longitudinal muscles are primarily responsible for evacuating wastes from this segment. A circular muscle structure (sphincter) at the junction between the sigmoid colon and the rectum keeps material within the colon until it is ready to be passed. Strong longitudinal muscle contractions then expel waste material through the sphincter and into the rectum. Fecal material can be stored in the sigmoid colon for seven hours or more and is usually expelled when new waste material requires entry into this region.
