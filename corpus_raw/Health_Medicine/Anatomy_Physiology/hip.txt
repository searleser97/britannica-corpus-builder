Hip,  in anatomy, the joint between the thighbone (femur) and the pelvis; also the area adjacent to this joint. The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint; the round head of the femur rests in a cavity (the acetabulum) that allows free rotation of the limb. Amphibians and reptiles have relatively weak pelvic girdles, and the femur extends horizontally. This does not permit efficient resistance to gravity, and the trunks of these animals often rest partially on the ground. In mammals the hip joint allows the femur to drop vertically, thus permitting the animal to hold itself off the ground and leading to specializations for running and leaping. See also pelvic girdle.
