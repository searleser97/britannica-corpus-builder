Basisphenoid bone,  in reptiles, birds, and many mammals, a bone located at the base of the skull. It is immediately in front of the bone that contains the opening through which the brainstem projects to connect with the spinal cord. In humans the basisphenoid is present in the embryo but later fuses with the rest of the sphenoid. It contains the hollow in which the pituitary gland rests.
