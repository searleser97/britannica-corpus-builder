Masseter,  (from Greek masasthai, “to chew”), prominent muscle of the jaw. The masseter arises from the zygomatic bone (cheekbone) and is inserted at the rear of the mandible (jawbone). Contraction of the muscle raises the mandible, and it is particularly used in chewing food. The masseter can be felt at the side of the jaw when the teeth are clenched.
