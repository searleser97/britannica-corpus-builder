Mantle, also called pallium, plural pallia,  or palliums,  in biology, soft covering, formed from the body wall, of brachiopods and mollusks; also, the fleshy outer covering, sometimes strengthened by calcified plates, of barnacles.
The mantle of mollusks and brachiopods secretes the shell in species that possess shells. It also forms a mantle cavity between itself and the body. The brachiopod mantle has a dorsal and a ventral lobe covered with small papillae (nipple-like projections) that penetrate into the shell. The molluscan mantle has a left and a right lobe and, as in bivalves, may be joined at the edge to form siphons for directing water into and out of the mantle cavity.
