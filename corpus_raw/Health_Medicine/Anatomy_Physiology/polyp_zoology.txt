Polyp,  in zoology, one of two principal body forms occurring in members of the animal phylum Cnidaria. The polyp may be solitary, as in the sea anemone, or colonial, as in coral, and is sessile (attached to a surface). The upper, or free, end of the body, which is hollow and cylindrical, typically has a mouth surrounded by extensible tentacles that bear complex stinging structures called nematocysts. The tentacles capture prey, which is then drawn into the mouth. The lower end of the polyp typically is adapted for attachment to a surface. The body wall consists of an ectodermal, or outer, layer and an endodermal, or inner, layer.
Members of one class of cnidarians, the Anthozoa, exhibit only the polyp body form; most species of the other three classes (hydrozoans, scyphozoans, and cubozoans) alternate in their life cycles between polypoid and medusoid (free-swimming) body forms. In general, the jellyfish-shaped medusae are produced asexually by the polyp, whereas sperm and eggs are produced by the medusae. Compare medusa.
The term polyp also is sometimes applied to an individual in a colony of invertebrate aquatic animals belonging to the phylum Bryozoa, although those individuals are usually called zooids.
