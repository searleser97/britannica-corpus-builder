Ectropion,  outward turning of the border (or margin) of the eyelid (usually the lower eyelids). The condition most often occurs in elderly persons as a result of age-related relaxation of the eyelidâ€™s supporting structures. Other causes include congenital malformation of the lid, paralysis of the muscles that control eyelid movement, excessive scarring and contraction of the eyelid, or mechanical pulling on the eyelid by tumours or improperly fitting eyeglasses. In the lower lid, this may cause the punctum (the opening into the channel that carries tears from the eye into the nasal cavity) to move away from the eyeball. As a result, tears fail to drain properly, and chronic excessive tearing, known as epiphora, is experienced. Other symptoms of ectropion include eye surface irritation and redness. Chronic exposure of the eye surface from poor lid apposition and altered tear film dynamics can lead to serious corneal problems. Mild cases can be treated with artificial eye lubrication, but definitive treatment is surgical.  Compare entropion.
