Coloboma,  failure of one or more structures in the eye to fuse during embryonic life, creating a congenital fissure in that eye. Frequently several structures are fissured: the choroid (the pigmented middle layer of the wall of the eye), the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the back and sides of the eye), the ciliary body (the source of the aqueous humour and the site of the ciliary muscle, by which the curvature of the crystalline lens is flattened for far vision), and the iris (the pigmented ring of tissue visible around the pupil). The fissure may extend to the head of the optic nerve. Colobomata may also be confined to individual structures of the eye. Fissures in the retina cause blind spots (scotomata), and a coloboma in the optic nerve also seriously affects vision.
