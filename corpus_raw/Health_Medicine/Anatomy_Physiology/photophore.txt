Photophore,   light-emitting organ present in fireflies and certain other bioluminescent animals. Photophores are glandular in origin and produce light by a chemical reaction. Photophores vary in size and form but often contain such structures as lenses, reflecting layers, and filters in addition to the light-producing material. See also bioluminescence.
