Smell, also called olfaction,  the detection and identification by sensory organs of airborne chemicals. The concept of smell, as it applies to humans, becomes less distinct when invertebrates and lower vertebrates (fish and amphibians) are considered, because many lower animals detect chemicals in the environment by means of receptors in various locations on the body, and no invertebrate possesses a chemoreceptive structure resembling the vertebrate nasal cavity. For this reason, many authorities prefer to regard smell as distance chemoreception and taste as contact chemoreception.
Olfaction by air-breathing vertebrates depends primarily on chemically sensitive nerves with endings in the lining (epithelium) of the nasal cavity. Mammals such as carnivores, which rely heavily on the sense of smell for locating food or for warning against predators, have intricately curled turbinal bones (which support the nasal epithelium), providing greater surface area, thus increasing olfactory sensitivity.
In addition to the nasal epithelium, Jacobsonâ€™s organ, located in the roof of the mouth, also serves for chemoreception in some animals. See also chemoreception; nose; perception.
