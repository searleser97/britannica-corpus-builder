Bacteremia,  the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, whether associated with active disease or not. The transient bacteremia that follows dental manipulation or surgical procedures may have little significance in the otherwise healthy individual with a functioning immune system. By contrast, extensive bacteremia, when it is associated with the release of bacterial toxins into the circulation (septicemia; see also sepsis), can be a serious medical emergency leading to bacteremic shock and eventual vascular collapse. Even transient bacteremia can be a serious matter for those with prosthetic devices (which can serve as foci for infection) or for those with debilitating medical conditions that increase susceptibility to bacterial invasion.
Bacteremia can follow certain infections, such as abscesses of the skin or pneumonia, and is associated with particularly high-risk surgical procedures, especially in the digestive or urinary tract, that release bacteria from sequestered sites into the blood, which may carry infection to remote parts of the body. Bacteremia is also associated with the use of contaminated needles for the injection of recreational drugs.
Bacteremia can often be anticipated in individuals undergoing high-risk surgical procedures, with preventive antibiotic therapy being given to forestall extensive bacterial invasion of the bloodstream. Despite such precautions, the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), has led to an increase in the incidence of severe bacteremia.
