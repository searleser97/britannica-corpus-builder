Thoracic duct,  in mammalian anatomy, a principal channel for lymph. From about the level of the small of the back it runs up through the body, close in front of the backbone, to the base of the neck, where it opens into a blood vessel, at the point at which the left subclavian vein and the left internal jugular vein join to form the left brachiocephalic vein.
