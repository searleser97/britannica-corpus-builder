Inosinic acid,   a compound important in metabolism. It is the ribonucleotide of hypoxanthine and is the first compound formed during the synthesis of purine in organisms. From inosinic acid are derived such important compounds as the purine nucleotides found in nucleic acids and the energy-rich purine nucleotide adenosine triphosphate, in which chemical energy is stored in cells.
