Nucleoprotein,   conjugated protein consisting of a protein linked to a nucleic acid, either DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) or RNA (ribonucleic acid). The protein combined with DNA is commonly either histone or protamine; the resulting nucleoproteins are found in chromosomes. Many viruses are little more than organized collections of deoxyribonucleoproteins. Little is known about the proteins linked with RNA; unlike protamine and histone, they appear to contain the amino acid tryptophan.
