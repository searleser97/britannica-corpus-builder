Face,  front part of the head that, in vertebrates, houses the sense organs of vision and smell as well as the mouth and jaws. In humans it extends from the forehead to the chin.
During the course of evolution from the prehuman Australopithecus to modern humans (Homo sapiens), the face became smaller in relation to the overall size of the head. While brain and braincase (cranium) tripled in volume, the jaws became shorter and the teeth simpler in form and smaller in size. In consequence, the face receded beneath the forehead. Thus, the modern human face exhibits an essentially vertical profile, in marked contrast to the protruding facial muzzle of the gorilla, the chimpanzee, and, to a lesser extent, extinct hominids. The recession of the tooth-bearing portion of the jaws beneath the forehead left two distinctively human features: a prominent, projecting nose and a clearly defined chin.
In individual development the human face and braincase follow different patterns of growth. The brain and braincase attain 90 percent of adult size by the age of 6 years, while the face grows more slowly in concurrence with the enlargement of the nasal passages and the eruption of both sets of teeth. Viewed in profile, the face at birth is less than one-fifth the size of the braincase; by adulthood it has increased to nearly half. Facial dimensions increase most in depth, next in height (length), and least in width. During adolescence, facial musculature increases and the facial sinuses enlarge, in general to a greater extent in males than in females.
