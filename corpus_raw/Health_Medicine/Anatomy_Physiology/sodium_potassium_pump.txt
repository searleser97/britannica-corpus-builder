Sodium-potassium pump,  in cellular physiology, a protein that has been identified in many cells that maintains the internal concentration of potassium ions [K+] higher than that in the surrounding medium (blood, body fluid, water) and maintains the internal concentration of sodium ions [Na+] lower than that of the surrounding medium. The pump, which has adenosine-triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, traverses the cell membrane and is activated by external [K+] and internal [Na+]. This enzyme uses metabolic energy to transport (pump) Na+ outward and K+ inward. The resting potential of cells and related bioelectric phenomena such as the action potential depend on the steady state difference in concentrations of Na+ and K+ maintained by the pump. Other ion pumps, transporting different ions, have also been identified.
