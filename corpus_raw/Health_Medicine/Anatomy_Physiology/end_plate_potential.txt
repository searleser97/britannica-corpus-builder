End-plate potential (EPP),  chemically induced change in electric potential of the motor end plate, the portion of the muscle-cell membrane that lies opposite the terminal of a nerve fibre at the neuromuscular junction. The end-plate membrane is electrically polarized, the inside being negative with respect to the outside because of an uneven distribution of ions. When a nerve impulse releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from the nerve terminal, it binds to channel-shaped receptor molecules on the end plate, opening the channels and allowing positively charged sodium ions to flow into the muscle cell. This redistribution of ions slightly depolarizes the membrane. An enzyme then rapidly degrades the acetylcholine, closing the channels and allowing the membrane to return to its previous polarized state.
Acetylcholine is released in bursts, or quanta. A single quantum causes only a slight depolarization, called a miniature end-plate potential (MEPP). One hundred to 200 quanta, released simultaneously or in rapid series by a nerve impulse, cause multiple MEPPs, which summate, or combine, to produce an EPP. If the EPP depolarizes the cell to a crucial threshold level, it will fully activate sodium channels along the membrane and produce the action potential. The action potential will then stimulate the muscle cell to contract.
