Pseudocopulation,   the action of a male insect, such as a bee, wasp, or fly, that tries to mate with a flower whose parts resemble those of a female insect of the same species as the male. Masses of pollen become attached to the male insect during this process and are transferred to the next flower visited by the insect, thus pollinating it.
The term pseudocopulation also refers to the close positioning of a male animal and a female of the same species, as in frogs, to facilitate contact between eggs and sperm at the time of discharge. True copulation, or sexual union between individuals, does not occur in this process.
