Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome,  either of two familial syndromes in which affected patients have multiple endocrine gland deficiencies. Some patients produce serum antibodies that react with, and presumably damage, multiple endocrine glands and other tissues, and other patients produce lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that migrate into and damage endocrine glands.
Type 1 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome occurs in children or adolescents and is characterized primarily by hypoparathyroidism (deficiency of parathormone), infection with the fungal organism Candida albicans, which causes candidiasis of the skin or the mucous membrane of the mouth, and adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). Affected patients may also have diabetes mellitus, hypogonadism (inadequate secretion of sex hormones and development of sex organs), hypothyroidism (decreased secretion of thyroid hormone), or intestinal malabsorption. Type 1 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait (the abnormal gene must be inherited from both parents) and is caused by a mutation in the AIRE (autoimmune regulator) gene; the gene product and its function are not known.
Type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome occurs in adults and is characterized by adrenal insufficiency, type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism or  Graves disease, hypogonadism, and pernicious anemia. Type 2 polyglandular autoimmune syndrome may affect multiple members of a family, but the pattern of inheritance is not known.
