Natural childbirth,  any of the systems of managing parturition in which the need for anesthesia, sedation, or surgery is largely eliminated by physical and psychological conditioning. Until the early 20th century, the term natural childbirth was thought of as synonymous with normal childbirth. In 1933 the British obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read wrote a book entitled Natural Childbirth, in which he postulated that excessive pain in labour results from muscular tension arising from fear of the birth process; he proposed that pregnant women attend a course of study to learn more about the birth process and to be instructed in breathing techniques and relaxation exercises useful during labour. Dick-Readâ€™s and other methods became popular in the mid-1950s.
Some of the natural childbirth methods that have developed from the Dick-Read method include those of Fernand Lamaze, Elisabeth Bing, Robert Bradley, and Charles Leboyer. Although there are differences among their methods, all share the basic belief that if the prospective mother learns and practices techniques of physical and psychological conditioning, her discomfort during delivery will be lessened. Preparation also includes full instruction and coaching on the anatomy and physiology of the birth process, thus enabling the mother to better cooperate and facilitate the delivery rather than to resist the process. Many of the methods encourage participation by the prospective father during labour and delivery, primarily to provide emotional support. See also Lamaze.
