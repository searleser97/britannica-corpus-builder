Nephron,  functional unit of the kidney, the structure that actually produces urine in the process of removing waste and excess substances from the blood. There are about 1,000,000 nephrons in each human kidney. The most primitive nephrons are found in the kidneys (pronephros) of primitive fish, amphibian larvae, and embryos of more advanced vertebrates. The nephrons found in the kidneys (mesonephros) of amphibians and most fish, and in the late embryonic development of more advanced vertebrates, are only slightly more advanced in structure. The most advanced nephrons occur in the adult kidneys, or metanephros, of land vertebrates, such as reptiles, birds, and mammals.
Each nephron in the mammalian kidney is a long tubule, or extremely fine tube, about 30–55 mm (1.2–2.2 inches) long. At one end this tube is closed, expanded, and folded into a double-walled cuplike structure. This structure, called the renal corpuscular capsule, or Bowman’s capsule, encloses a cluster of microscopic blood vessels—capillaries—called the glomerulus. The capsule and glomerulus together constitute the renal corpuscle. Blood flows into and away from the glomerulus through tiny arteries called arterioles, which reach and leave the glomerulus through the open end of the capsule. In the renal corpuscle, fluid filters out of the blood in the glomerulus through the inner wall of the capsule and into the nephron tubule. As this filtrate passes through the tubule, its composition is altered by the secretion of certain substances into it and by the selective reabsorption of water and other constituents from it. The final product is urine, which is conveyed through the collecting tubules into the renal pelvis.
