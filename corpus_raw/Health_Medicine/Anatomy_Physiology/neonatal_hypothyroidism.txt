Neonatal hypothyroidism, also called cretinism,  condition characterized by the absence, lack, or dysfunction of thyroid hormone production in infancy. This form of hypothyroidism may be present at birth, in which case it is called congenital hypothyroidism, or it may develop shortly after birth, in which case it is known as hypothyroidism acquired in the newborn period.
Neonatal hypothyroidism may be caused by complete absence of the thyroid gland, by abnormal development of the thyroid gland, by dysfunctional stimulation of the thyroid gland by pituitary hormones, or by dysfunctional thyroid hormone. Whereas some affected infants may be asymptomatic initially, others may have a puffy face and lacklustre appearance. Those symptoms typically become apparent in most affected infants as the condition progresses. Other symptoms include poor appetite, poor muscle tone, sleepiness, jaundice, and constipation.
Although neonatal hypothyroidism can lead to intellectual disability and stunted growth, the severity of outcomes can be lessened when treatment is begun in the first month of life. Treatment usually consists of administration of thyroxine.
