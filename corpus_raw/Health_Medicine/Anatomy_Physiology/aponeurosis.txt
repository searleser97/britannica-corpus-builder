Aponeurosis,   a flat sheet or ribbon of tendonlike material that anchors a muscle or connects it with the part that the muscle moves. The aponeurosis is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue containing fibroblasts (collagen-secreting spindle-shaped cells) and bundles of collagenous fibres in ordered arrays. Aponeuroses are structurally similar to tendons and ligaments.
