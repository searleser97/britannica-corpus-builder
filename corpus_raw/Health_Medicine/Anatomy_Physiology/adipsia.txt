Adipsia, also called hypodipsia,  rare disorder characterized by the lack of thirst even in the presence of dehydration. In adipsia the brainâ€™s thirst centre, located in the hypothalamus, is damaged. People with adipsia have little or no sensation of thirst when they become dehydrated. These people must be instructed, even forced, to drink fluid at regular intervals.
A person becomes dehydrated when he is deprived of fluids or when he is losing excessive fluids from the body, such as from excessive perspiration, persistent vomiting, or diarrhea. In these circumstances, the volume of fluid in the circulation (plasma volume) is reduced and the serum concentration of solutes (osmolality) is therefore proportionately increased. The decrease in plasma volume and the proportional increase in serum osmolality serve as potent stimuli for the secretion of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), which then acts on the kidneys to promote retention of water. The most common causes of adipsia include lesions and other forms of trauma that affect the thirst centre in the hypothalamus.
