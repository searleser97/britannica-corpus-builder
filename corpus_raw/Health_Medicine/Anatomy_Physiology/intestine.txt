Intestine,  tubular part of the alimentary canal that extends from the stomach to the anus. The intestine is the site of most chemical digestive processes and the place where digested food materials are either absorbed for use by the body or collected into feces for elimination. The anterior part of the intestine, which is linked to the stomach, is called the small intestine. It is followed by a shorter, wider segment called the large intestine, which terminates in the anus.
