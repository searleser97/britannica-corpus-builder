Renal collecting tubule, also called duct of Bellini,  any of the long narrow tubes in the kidney that concentrate and transport urine from the nephrons, the chief functioning units of the kidneys, to larger ducts that connect with the renal calyces, cavities in which urine gathers until it flows through the renal pelvis and the ureter to the urinary bladder. The collecting tubules connect with the nephron tubules in the outer layer of the kidney known as the cortex.
Each collecting tubule is about 20–22 mm (about 0.8–0.9 inch) long and 20–50 microns (about 0.0008–0.002 inch) in diameter. The walls of the tubules are composed of microvilli, as well as cells with hairlike projections (sensory cilia) that play a role in the tubule’s response to hormones. Hydrostatic pressure helps to move secretions through the tubes. As the collecting tubes become wider in diameter, the cells increase in height so that the wall becomes thicker.
The functions of the collecting tubes are transportation of urine and absorption of water. It is thought that the tissue of the kidney’s medulla, or inner substance, contains a high concentration of sodium. As the collecting tubules travel through the medulla, the concentration of sodium causes water to be extracted through the tubule walls into the medulla. The water diffuses out between the collecting wall cells until the concentration of sodium is equal in the tubes and outside them. Removal of water from the solution in the tubes serves to concentrate the urine content and conserve body water.
Pathologic changes that can afflict the tubules include degeneration or atrophy of the tube walls; deposition of calcium compounds; infection by viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites; presence of crystals; dilatation or blockage of the tubes; and malignant tumours.
