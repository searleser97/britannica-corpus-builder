Dermatochalasis,  sagging of the eyelid skin and underlying muscle that occurs commonly during the aging process. Symptoms may be absent or include brow ache, reduction of superior peripheral vision, sensation of the lid skin resting on the eyelashes, and interference of vision by the eyelashes. Forward displacement of orbital fat may exacerbate this condition. Treatment is predominantly surgical.
Blepharochalasis, a condition distinct from dermatochalasis, is a rare inherited disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammatory lid swelling. This condition typically afflicts young individuals.
