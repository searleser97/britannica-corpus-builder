Pulmonary circulation,    system of blood vessels that forms a closed circuit between the heart and the lungs, as distinguished from the systemic circulation between the heart and all other body tissues. On the evolutionary cycle, pulmonary circulation first occurs in lungfishes and amphibians, the first animals to acquire a three-chambered heart. The pulmonary circulation becomes totally separate in crocodilians, birds, and mammals, when the ventricle is divided into two chambers, producing a four-chambered heart. In these forms the pulmonary circuit begins with the right ventricle, which pumps deoxygenated blood through the pulmonary artery. This artery divides above the heart into two branches, to the right and left lungs, where the arteries further subdivide into smaller and smaller branches until the capillaries in the pulmonary air sacs (alveoli) are reached. In the capillaries the blood takes up oxygen from the air breathed into the air sacs and releases carbon dioxide. It then flows into larger and larger vessels until the pulmonary veins (usually four in number, each serving a whole lobe of the lung) are reached. The pulmonary veins open into the left atrium of the heart. Compare systemic circulation.
