Retinopathy of prematurity, also called ROP,  disease in which retinal blood vessels develop abnormally in the eyes of premature infants. In mild forms of retinopathy of prematurity, developing blood vessels within the retina, which originate at the optic disk, stop growing toward the periphery of the retina for a period of time. Thereafter, the vessels usually resume their development without deleterious consequences. However, in severe forms of retinopathy of prematurity, the stalled blood vessels break through to the surface of the retina and proliferate extensively. These fragile tangles of blood vessels can break, bleed, scar, and pull on the underlying retina, causing complex retinal detachments and blindness.
The likelihood of developing retinopathy of prematurity increases with lower birth weights and earlier deliveries. Retinopathy of prematurity is associated with the administration of high concentrations of oxygen, given to susceptible infants in an attempt to prevent respiratory disease. Despite the potential risk of retinopathy of prematurity, many infants require the use of supplemental oxygen to prevent neurologic dysfunction and loss of life. With current approaches to oxygen therapy and close monitoring, retinopathy of prematurity has become less common. Even so, the disease remains a significant cause of early childhood-onset visual loss, occasionally occurring even in infants who do not receive supplemental oxygen.
When necessary, treatment is aimed at destroying those areas of retina that do not have mature retinal blood vessels, usually with laser therapy or cryotherapy (freezing therapy). Additional complications of retinopathy of prematurity include amblyopia, cataract, glaucoma, and nearsightedness (myopia), among others.
