Amblyopia,  reduction in vision in one or both eyes due to abnormal visual experience in early childhood, leading to functional changes in the visual centres of the brain. These changes result from eye-related problems that degrade or distort images received by the brain. The most common causes are misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) and uncorrected (usually asymmetric) refractive errors (e.g., farsightedness, nearsightedness, or astigmatism). Other conditions that affect the clarity of vision, such as congenital cataracts, can also cause amblyopia. In each of these situations the brain receives inferior or inappropriate visual information, which it suppresses over time.
If left untreated, these changes within the visual centres of the brain will become permanent and lead to irreversible vision deficits. Fortunately, this outcome is usually avoidable or reversible during early childhood by promptly correcting the underlying eye problem (removing the cataract or prescribing eyeglasses) or forcing the use of the weaker eye, often by carefully covering the stronger eye with a patch. However, despite the availability of effective treatments, amblyopia remains a major cause of childhood-onset reduced vision. Vision screening is an essential means of identifying children at risk of developing amblyopia.
