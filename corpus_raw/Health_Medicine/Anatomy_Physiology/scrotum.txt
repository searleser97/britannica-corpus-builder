Scrotum,  in the male reproductive system, a thin external sac of skin that is divided into two compartments; each compartment contains one of the two testes, the glands that produce sperm, and one of the epididymides, where the sperm is stored. The scrotum is a unique anatomical feature of humans and certain other species of land-dwelling mammals. It is continuous with the skin of the lower abdomen and is located directly behind the penis and in front of the anus. The scrotal wall is a thin layer of skin lined with smooth muscle tissue (dartos fascia). The skin contains more pigment than that of surrounding areas and has many sebaceous (oil-producing) glands and sweat glands, as well as some hair. The two compartments of the scrotum are distinguished externally by a middle ridge called the raphe. Internally, the raphe connects to a muscular partition, the septum, which serves to divide the scrotum into its two areas.
The function of the scrotum is to protect the testes and to keep them at a temperature several degrees below the normal body temperature. The scrotum thus protrudes from the body wall: moreover, it contracts from cold, exercise, or sexual stimulation and expands and relaxes when warm. When contracted, it conserves heat; while relaxed it is smooth and elongated, permitting the circulation of air that effects cooling. The relatively cool temperature of the scrotum is thought to be important for the production of viable sperm.
The muscle tone of the scrotum becomes weakened and relaxed in older men. In animals whose scrotum is always tight against the body, as in rats, boars, and stallions, the testes are cooled by the intricate blood system that surrounds them. Failure of the scrotum to cool the testes, which occurs during high fevers or, in some animals, during the hot summer months, causes temporary sterility.
