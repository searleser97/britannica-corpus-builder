Jugular vein,  any of several veins of the neck that drain blood from the brain, face, and neck, returning it to the heart via the superior vena cava. The main vessels are the external jugular vein and the interior jugular vein. The external jugular vein receives blood from the neck, the outside of the cranium, and the deep tissues of the face and empties into the subclavian veins (continuations of the principal veins of the arms or forelimbs). Among the tributaries of the external jugular veins are the posterior external jugular veins, which receive blood from the back of the neck, and the anterior external jugular veins, which receive blood from the larynx (or voice box) and other tissues below the lower jaw. The internal jugular veins unite with the subclavian veins to form the brachiocephalic veins and drain blood from the brain, the face, and the neck.
