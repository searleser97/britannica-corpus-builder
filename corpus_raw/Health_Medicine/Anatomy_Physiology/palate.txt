Palate,   in vertebrate anatomy, the roof of the mouth, separating the oral and nasal cavities. It consists of an anterior hard palate of bone and, in mammals, a posterior soft palate that has no skeletal support and terminates in a fleshy, elongated projection called the uvula.
The hard palate, which composes two-thirds of the total palate area, is a plate of bone covered by a moist, durable layer of mucous-membrane tissue, which secretes small amounts of mucus. This layer forms several ridges that help grip food while the tongue agitates it during chewing. The hard palate provides space for the tongue to move freely and supplies a rigid floor to the nasal cavity so that pressures within the mouth do not close off the nasal passage. In many lower vertebrates the hard palate bears teeth.
The soft palate is composed of muscle and connective tissue, which give it both mobility and support. This palate is very flexible. When elevated for swallowing and sucking, it completely blocks and separates the nasal cavity and nasal portion of the pharynx from the mouth and the oral part of the pharynx. While elevated, the soft palate creates a vacuum in the oral cavity, which keeps food out of the respiratory tract.
The first well-developed palates are found in the reptiles, although only in the form of a hard partition. Palates similar to those in humans occur only in birds and some mammals. In a few whales the mucous membrane forms toughened plates known as baleen, or whalebone.
In the human abnormality of cleft palate, the separation between the nose and mouth is incomplete, allowing food to enter the nose and interfering with speech. This condition can be corrected surgically.
