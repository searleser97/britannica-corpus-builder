Sclerotin,   a dark-brown biological pigment formed by an enzyme-catalyzed tanning of protein. Sclerotin is found in the cuticle (external covering) and egg cases of insects, the body shell (carapace) of certain crustaceans, and the bristles of terrestrial and marine worms. Sclerotin not only darkens the cuticle of insects, thus contributing to the shielding of injurious light rays, as does melanin, but also effects a distinct protective hardening of the cuticular protein.
