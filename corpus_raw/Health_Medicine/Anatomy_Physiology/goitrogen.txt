Goitrogen,  substance that inhibits the synthesis of the thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodothyronine), thereby reducing the output of these hormones. This inhibition causes, through negative feedback, an increased output of thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Increased thyrotropin stimulates both the excess secretion of thyroid hormones and the excess growth of thyroid cells, thereby causing an enlargement of the thyroid gland (goitre). Some goitrogens (e.g., thiocyanates) reduce or inhibit the uptake of iodide; others (e.g., thiourea, thiouracil) inhibit the peroxidase system and thus prevent the binding of iodine to thyroglobulin (a large protein that is cleaved to form the thyroid hormones and that is stored within the follicles of the thyroid gland).
Goitrogens can contribute to the enlargement of the thyroid gland in persons affected by chronic iodine deficiency. Some foods, such as cassava, millet, sweet potato, certain beans, and members of the cabbage family, contain goitrogens. Goitrogens can be destroyed by cooking; however, they can be a significant factor in persons with coexisting iodine deficiency who rely on goitrogenic foods as staples in their diets.
