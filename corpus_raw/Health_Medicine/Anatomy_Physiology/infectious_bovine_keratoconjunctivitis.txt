Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis, also called pinkeye, or infectious keratitis,  an inflammation of the conjunctiva or the cornea of the eye in cattle as the result of an infection; early viral involvement is suspected. Moraxella bovis is usually found in discharge from the affected eye; other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium, are also often present. Ultraviolet rays from the sun may play a role in the inflammation; face flies may transmit the disease. Beef cattle afflicted with the disease lose weight, and dairy cattle may produce as much as 25 percent less milk. Antibiotics may be effective for treatment of this disease.
