Catabolism,  the sequences of enzyme-catalyzed reactions by which relatively large molecules in living cells are broken down, or degraded. Part of the chemical energy released during catabolic processes is conserved in the form of energy-rich compounds (e.g., adenosine triphosphate [ATP]).
Energy is released in three phases. In the first, large molecules, such as those of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, are broken down; small amounts of energy are released in the form of heat in these processes. In the second phase, the small molecules are oxidized, liberating chemical energy to form ATP as well as heat energy, to form one of the three compounds: acetate, oxaloacetate, or Î±-oxoglutarate. These are oxidized to carbon dioxide during the third phase, a cyclic reaction sequence called the tricarboxylic acid (or Krebs) cycle. Hydrogen atoms or electrons from the intermediate compounds formed during the cycle are transferred (through a succession of carrier molecules) ultimately to oxygen, forming water. These events, the most important means for generating ATP in cells, are known as terminal respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (see cellular respiration).
