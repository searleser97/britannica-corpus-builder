Diethylstilbestrol (DES),  nonsteroidal synthethic estrogen used as a drug and formerly used to promote growth of livestock. Unlike natural estrogens, DES remains active following oral administration. It is also administered as vaginal suppositories and by injection. DES breaks down more slowly in the body than do the natural estrogens.
DES is used therapeutically to replace estrogen during menopause, to relieve painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea), to stimulate the development of secondary sexual characteristics in women with nonfunctioning ovaries, and to palliate advanced breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men.
Beginning in the 1940s and continuing for more than 20 years, DES was frequently prescribed to pregnant women to prevent miscarriages. In 1971 investigators demonstrated statistically that daughters of women taking DES had abnormally high rates of an otherwise rare form of cervicovaginal cancer. The use of DES and other estrogens during pregnancy is now proscribed in many countries.
Until the 1970s it was common practice to stimulate the fattening of beef cattle and chickens by mixing small amounts of DES into the feed or by implanting pellets of DES under the skin in the ears of the animals. Concern over trace amounts of the hormone in meat led to bans on the use of DES as a livestock growth stimulant beginning in the early 1970s.
