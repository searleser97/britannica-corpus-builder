Colic,  pain produced by the contraction of the muscular walls of any hollow organ, such as the renal pelvis, the biliary tract, or the gastrointestinal tract, of which the aperture has become more or less blocked, temporarily or otherwise. In infants, usually those who are bottle-fed, intestinal colic is common and is shown by the drawing up of the infant’s legs, restlessness, and continuous crying. Colic may accompany any form of enteritis or an intestinal tumour, as well as certain forms of influenza. Colic caused by spastic contractions of the bowel is a common symptom of lead poisoning. Treatment for colic depends on the cause and is aimed at relief of symptoms; it often includes the administration of a muscle relaxant such as atropine and, occasionally, meperidine hydrochloride (marketed as Demerol™).
