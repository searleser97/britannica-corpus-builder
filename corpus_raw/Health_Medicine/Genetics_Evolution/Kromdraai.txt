Kromdraai,  South African paleoanthropological site best known for its fossils of Paranthropus robustus. Kromdraai is a limestone cave that has occasionally had openings to the surface. The remains of hominins (members of the human lineage) found in it are associated with animals that are thought to be about two million years old and that were adapted to relatively dry and open habitats. The site also contains stone tools similar to those found at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Kromdraai is one of three neighbouring South African sites where important evidence of human evolution has been found. Kromdraai, Sterkfontein, and Swartkrans are located within the Cradle of Humankind, a region designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1999.
