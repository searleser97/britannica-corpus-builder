Kim Soon-Kwon,  (born May 1, 1945, Ulsan, South Kyongsang province, Korea [now South Korea]), South Korean agricultural scientist who developed hybrid corn (maize) that significantly increased crop production in North Korea and South Korea.
After graduating from Ulsan Agricultural High School and Kyungpook National University, Taegu, Kim earned a master’s degree from Korea University, Seoul. In 1974 he earned a doctorate in horticulture from the University of Hawaii, Manoa. In the late 1970s he directed a national program in South Korea credited with tripling corn production in the country.
From 1979 to 1995 Kim worked for the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), conducting extensive research in Nigeria. He was successful in developing corn that was resistant to an array of parasites, insects, and diseases, including maize streak virus and a virulent killer weed called striga. His hybrid techniques produced phenomenally high-yielding crops and were environmentally friendly, allowing farmers to avoid the conventional use of chemicals to control agricultural pests.
Kim returned to South Korea at the end of 1995 as professor of plant hybridization and director of the International Agricultural Institute at Kyungpook National University. As food shortages in North Korea reached a critical point, he broached the idea of a “Corn for Peace” project, asserting that the North possessed all the necessary conditions for growing corn and that his project could increase North Korea’s current corn production as well as foster good relations between North and South. Kim was permitted to visit North Korea in order to collect data on the country’s soil and climate, and by 1999 his corn-breeding techniques were being tested in some 1,000 North Korean cooperative farm units. In 2004 Kim coordinated a similar program in Mongolia, hybridizing varieties of corn specifically adapted to the climatic constraints of the region.
