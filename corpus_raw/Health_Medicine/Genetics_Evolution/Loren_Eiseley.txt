Loren Eiseley, in full Loren Corey Eiseley,  (born September 3, 1907, Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.—died July 9, 1977, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), American anthropologist, educator, and author who wrote about anthropology for the lay person in eloquent, poetic style.
Eiseley was educated at the University of Nebraska (B.A., 1933) and the University of Pennsylvania (M.A., 1935; Ph.D., 1937) and began his academic career at the University of Kansas (1937–44) and Oberlin College (1944–47). In his long association with the University of Pennsylvania he served as professor of anthropology (1947–61), curator of early man at the University Museum (1947–77), provost of the university (1959–61), and professor of anthropology and the history of science (1961–77). He also served as a consultant to museums, foundations, and the U.S. government and was the host–narrator of the television series Animal Secrets (1966–67). He received numerous honours, including membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Eiseley’s scientific research centred on the dating of index fossils of the Pleistocene Epoch and the extinction of Ice Age fauna. His writings, however, covered the wide range of the question of evolution and its implications for humanity. He published more than a dozen books, including The Immense Journey (1957), Darwin’s Century (1958), The Firmament of Time (1960; reprinted 1970), The Unexpected Universe (1969), and The Night Country (1971). He also published an autobiography, All the Strange Hours (1975), and a collection of poetry, Another Kind of Autumn (1977). A collection of his poems and selected essays, The Star Thrower, was published in 1979.
