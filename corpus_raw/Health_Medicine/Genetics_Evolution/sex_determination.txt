Sex determination,  the establishment of the sex of an organism, usually by the inheritance at the time of fertilization of certain genes commonly localized on a particular chromosome. This pattern affects the development of the organism by controlling cellular metabolism and stimulating the production of hormones that trigger the development of sexual glands or organs. An excess or lack of hormones during embryological development may cause an individual to develop the superficial appearance of one sex while retaining the genetic constitution of the other sex.
