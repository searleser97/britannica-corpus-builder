Koobi Fora,  a region of paleoanthropological sites in northern Kenya near Lake Turkana (Lake Rudolf). The Koobi Fora geologic formation consists of lake and river sediments from the eastern shore of Lake Turkana. Well-preserved hominin fossils dating from between 2.1 and 1.3 million years ago (mya) include at least one species of robust australopith (Paranthropus boisei) and three species of Homo (H. habilis, H. rudolfensis, and African H. erectus, which is also called H. ergaster). Stone tools dating to 2 mya resemble certain Oldowan industry artifacts from Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. Koobi Fora’s archaeological record dates to as recently as 1.4 mya, but there are very few Acheulean hand axes.
In other fossil-bearing sites west of Lake Turkana, several other species of hominins have been found, including Kenyanthropus platyops (3.2 mya), which has facial traits similar to those of the controversial 1.9-million-year-old H. habilis skull KNM-ER 1470—a skull that in some ways resembles Australopithecus. In sediments from 2.5 mya comes the “Black Skull” belonging to the robust australopith P. aethiopicus. In later beds occur representatives of P. boisei (2.3–1.6 mya), H. habilis (c. 2 mya), and H. ergaster/erectus (1.6 mya), including a nearly complete skeleton of an 11–13-year-old male called “Turkana Boy.” A 1.44-million-year-old jawbone ascribed to H. habilis and a 1.55-million-year-old skull belonging to H. erectus have been found east of Lake Turkana. These fossils suggest that H. habilis and H. erectus coexisted at this location for a time. Oldowan tools have been discovered near Lake Turkana as well, in sediments estimated to be 2.34 million years old; Acheulean tools appear by 1.65 mya.
