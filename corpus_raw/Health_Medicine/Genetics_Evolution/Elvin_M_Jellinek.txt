Elvin M. Jellinek,  (born Aug. 15, 1890, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Oct. 22, 1963, Palo Alto, Calif.), American physiologist who was a pioneer in the scientific study of alcoholism.
Jellinek studied at several European universities and received his master’s degree in 1914 from the University of Leipzig. He became a biometrician (i.e., one concerned with the statistics of biological studies) and worked for various institutions and organizations in Budapest (1914–20), Sierra Leone (1920–25), Honduras (1925–30), and at the Worcester State Hospital, Mass. (1931–39). In 1939 he began directing that hospital’s studies on the effects of alcohol, and in 1941 he became an associate professor of applied physiology at Yale University, where he directed the Yale University School of Alcohol Studies from 1941 to 1950. From 1962 until his death he taught and conducted research at the Institute for the Study of Human Problems at Stanford University.
Jellinek was a pioneer in research having to do with the nature and causes of alcoholism and in descriptions of its symptomatology. He was an early proponent of the disease theory of alcoholism, arguing with great persuasiveness that alcoholics should be treated as sick people. Jellinek gathered and summarized his own research and that of others in the important and authoritative works Alcohol Explored (1942) and The Disease Concept of Alcoholism (1960).
