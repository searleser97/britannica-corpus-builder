Episome,  in bacteria, one of a group of extrachromosomal genetic elements called plasmids, consisting of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and capable of conferring a selective advantage upon the bacteria in which they occur. Episomes may be attached to the bacterial cell membrane (such a cell is designated F+) or become integrated into the chromosome (such a cell is designated Hfr). F+ and Hfr cells act as donors during conjugation, a mating process in certain bacteria (e.g., Escherichia, Salmonella, Serratia, Pseudomonas). During conjugation, cells lacking the episome (called F- cells) may receive either the episome (from an F+ cell) or the episome plus the chromosomal genes to which it is attached (from an Hfr cell).
Some bacterial viruses, called temperate phages, carry DNA that can act as an episome. A bacterial cell into whose chromosome the viral DNA has become integrated is called a prophage. See lysogeny.
