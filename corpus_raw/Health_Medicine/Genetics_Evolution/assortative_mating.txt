Assortative mating,  in human genetics, a form of nonrandom mating in which pair bonds are established on the basis of phenotype (observable characteristics). For example, a person may choose a mate according to religious, cultural, or ethnic preferences, professional interests, or physical traits.
Positive assortative mating, or homogamy, exists when people choose to mate with persons similar to themselves (e.g., when a tall person mates with a tall person); this type of selection is very common. Negative assortative mating is the opposite case, when people avoid mating with persons similar to themselves.
Assortative mating also occurs in nonhuman animal populations. Indeed, phenotypic similarity is thought to underlie mate selection in a variety of species.
