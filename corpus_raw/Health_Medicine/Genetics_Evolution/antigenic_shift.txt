Antigenic shift,  genetic alteration occurring in an infectious agent that causes a dramatic change in a protein called an antigen, which stimulates the production of antibodies by the immune systems of humans and other animals. Antigenic shift has been studied most extensively in influenza type A viruses, which experience this change about once every 10 years. The newly emerged viruses have the potential to cause epidemics or pandemics, since very few, if any, humans possess immunity against the new antigens.
Antigenic shift occurs because influenza A viruses have a large animal reservoir, consisting primarily of wild aquatic birds (e.g., ducks). It also occurs because the RNA genome of influenza A viruses is in the form of eight segments, which during viral replication are susceptible to a type of genetic exchange known as genetic reassortment. Reassortment can result in antigenic shift when an intermediate host, such as a pig, is simultaneously infected with a human and an avian influenza A virus. The new version of the virus that is produced represents a new influenza A subtype and thus is immunologically distinct from influenza A viruses that have been circulating in the human population. Influenza A subtypes are distinguished by the two major antigenic glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), that exist on their viral coats. (H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 are examples of influenza A subtypes.)
Antigenic shift may also occur when an influenza A virus jumps directly from aquatic birds to humans or when a virus passes from aquatic birds to humans through an intermediate host without undergoing reassortment.
