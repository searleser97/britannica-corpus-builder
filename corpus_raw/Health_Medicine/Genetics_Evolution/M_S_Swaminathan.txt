M.S. Swaminathan, in full Monkombu Sambasivan Swaminathan,  (born August 7, 1925, Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, India), Indian geneticist and international administrator, renowned for his leading role in India’s “Green Revolution,” a program under which high-yield varieties of wheat and rice seedlings were planted in the fields of poor farmers.
Swaminathan, the son of a surgeon, was educated in India and at the University of Cambridge (Ph.D., 1952) as a geneticist. During the next two decades he held a number of research and administrative positions (mostly in the Indian civil service). While working in those positions, he helped introduce Mexican semidwarf wheat plants to Indian fields and helped to bring about greater acceptance of modern farming methods. From 1972 to 1979 he was director general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and he was principal secretary of the Indian ministry of agriculture and irrigation from 1979 to 1980. He served as director general of the International Rice Research Institute (1982–88) and as president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (1984–90).
