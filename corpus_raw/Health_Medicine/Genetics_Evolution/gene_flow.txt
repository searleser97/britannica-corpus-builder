Gene flow, also called gene migration,  the introduction of genetic material (by interbreeding) from one population of a species to another, thereby changing the composition of the gene pool of the receiving population. The introduction of new alleles through gene flow increases variability within the population and makes possible new combinations of traits. In humans gene flow usually comes about through the actual migration of human populations, either voluntary or forced.
Although gene flow does not change allele frequencies for a species as a whole, it can alter allele frequencies in local populations. In the case of migration, the greater the difference in allele frequencies between the resident and the migrant individuals, and the larger the number of migrants, the greater the effect the migrants have in changing the genetic constitution of the resident population.
