Aramis,  site of paleoanthropological excavations in the Awash River valley in the Afar region of Ethiopia, best known for its 4.4-million-year-old fossils of Ardipithecus ramidus found in 1992 and named in 1994.
Ardipithecus is one of the earliest well-documented examples that resembles what would be expected in the most recent common ancestor of humans and African apes. It shares with later hominins (members of the human lineage) a few key evolutionary novelties: though its skull and teeth are quite apelike, the upper canines are less projecting, with a shape more like those of later species. Also, the base of the skull is shorter than that of apes and more like that of hominins occurring later in human evolution. Animal fossils found at the site imply a closed-canopy woodland habitat.
Aramis is located about 100 km (60 miles) south of Hadar, where other australopith remains have been unearthed. About 10 km (6 miles) west of Aramis are sites that have yielded remains of Ardipithecus kadabba that date to between 5.2 and 5.8 million years ago. A toe bone recovered from this age range is unlike that of apes and has a diagnostically humanlike shape that indicates upright walking (bipedalism). This is part of the accumulating evidence confirming the hypothesis originally proposed by Charles Darwin and other 19th-century evolutionists that bipedalism preceded most other transformations in the human lineage.
