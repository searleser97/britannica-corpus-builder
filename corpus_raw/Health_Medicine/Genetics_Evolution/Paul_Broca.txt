Paul Broca,  (born June 28, 1824, Sainte-Foy-laGrande, Fr.—died  July 9, 1880, Paris), surgeon who was closely associated with the development of modern physical anthropology in France and whose study of brain lesions contributed significantly to understanding the origins of aphasia, the loss or impairment of the ability to form or articulate words. He founded the anthropology laboratory at the École des Hautes Études, Paris (1858), and the Société d’Anthropologie de Paris (1859).
Much of Broca’s research concerned the comparative study of the craniums of the so-called races of mankind. Following precedents set by Samuel Morton in the United States, Broca developed numerous techniques to study the form, structure, and topography of the brain and skull in order to identify and differentiate human races. As a polygenist who considered the major human racial groups as separate species, Broca wrote influential works on “hybridization,” or the mixture of races, arguing that some mixtures of closely related races were beneficial (“eugenic”) while mixtures of greatly differing races were harmful (“dysgenic”).
In 1861 he announced his discovery of the seats of articulate speech in the left frontal region of the brain, since known as the convolution of Broca. Thus, he also furnished the first anatomical proof of the localization of brain function. Founder of the Revue d’anthropologie (1872), he established the École d’Anthropologie, Paris (1876), and became its director. His writings include Mémoires d’anthropologie, 5 vol. (1871–78; “Memoirs of Anthropology”).
