Mario R. Capecchi,  (born Oct. 6, 1937, Verona, Italy), Italian-born American scientist who shared, with Sir Martin J. Evans and Oliver Smithies, the 2007 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his work on targeted gene modification.
During World War II, Capecchi lived on the streets after his  mother was imprisoned in Dachau, a Nazi concentration camp in Germany. He was reunited with her after the war, and in 1946 the family moved to the United States. After earning a bachelor’s degree at Antioch College (1961), he studied under James D. Watson at Harvard University (Ph.D., 1967). In 1969 Capecchi joined the faculty at Harvard’s medical school and four years later took a post at the University of Utah. In 1988 Capecchi became an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
In the 1980s Capecchi began his prize-winning research, which helped give rise to gene targeting. He developed a technique using recombinant DNA technology whereby DNA could be injected into the nucleus of mammalian cells, greatly enhancing the effectiveness of gene transfer. He further refined his procedure, incorporating the work of Evans and Smithies into his research, and the cooperative effort gave rise to the “knockout mouse”—a laboratory mouse in which one or more genes had been selectively inactivated or “knocked out.”
