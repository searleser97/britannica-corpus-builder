Gene pool,  sum of a population’s genetic material at a given time. The term typically is used in reference to a population made up of individuals of the same species and includes all genes and combinations of genes (sum of the alleles) in the population.
The composition of a population’s gene pool can change over time through evolution. This can occur by a variety of mechanisms, including mutations, natural selection, and genetic drift. The result is a gene pool that is altered to be attuned to the needs of the population’s specific environment. For example, the migration of human populations from equatorial regions toward northern climates, where they were exposed to relatively low amounts of sunlight, resulted in changes over time in skin pigmentation, with skin becoming lighter in colour to augment vitamin D absorption (vitamin D is critical for proper bone development). The genetic modifications underlying the change in pigmentation ultimately became a part of many of those populations’ gene pools.
The ability of a population to adapt and evolve is thought to be influenced in part by the size of its gene pool. A large and diverse gene pool, for example, may improve a population’s chances for future adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Populations with smaller, narrower gene pools, on the other hand, may be less successful when confronted with swift environmental change.
