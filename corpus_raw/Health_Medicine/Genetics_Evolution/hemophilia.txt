Hemophilia, also spelled haemophilia,  hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency of a substance necessary for blood clotting (coagulation). In hemophilia A, the missing substance is factor VIII. The increased tendency to bleeding usually becomes noticeable early in life and may lead to severe anemia or even death. Large bruises of the skin and soft tissue are often seen, usually following injury so trivial as to be unnoticed. There may also be bleeding in the mouth, nose, and gastrointestinal tract. After childhood, hemorrhages in the joints—notably the knees, ankles, and elbows—are frequent, resulting in swelling and impaired function.
The transmission of this condition is characteristically sex-linked, being expressed almost exclusively in males but transmitted solely by females; sons of a male with hemophilia are normal, but daughters, although outwardly normal, may transmit the trait as an overt defect to half their sons and as a recessive or hidden trait to half their daughters, as shown in the chart. The existence of hemophilia in certain royal families of Europe, particularly descendants of Great Britain’s Queen Victoria, is well known.
Hemophilia may also be attributed to a deficiency of factor IX (hemophilia B) or of factor XI (hemophilia C); hemophilia B (also called Christmas disease), like hemophilia A, is sex-linked and occurs almost only in males, whereas hemophilia C may be transmitted by both males and females and is found in both sexes.
Persons with hemophilia are ordinarily advised to avoid activities that might expose them to bodily injury. The management of bleeding episodes includes infusions of clotting factor, which is derived from human blood or by recombinant DNA technology. The drug desmopressin (DDAVP) is useful in treating milder forms of hemophilia A. Gene therapy has been shown to be effective in correcting factor IX deficiency associated with hemophilia B.
