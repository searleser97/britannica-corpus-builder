Allele, also called allelomorph,  any one of two or more genes that may occur alternatively at a given site (locus) on a chromosome. Alleles may occur in pairs, or there may be multiple alleles affecting the expression (phenotype) of a particular trait. The combination of alleles that an organism carries constitutes its genotype. If the paired alleles are the same, the organism’s genotype is said to be homozygous for that trait; if they are different, the organism’s genotype is heterozygous. A dominant allele will override the traits of a recessive allele in a heterozygous pairing. In some traits, however, alleles may be codominant—i.e., neither acts as dominant or recessive. An example is the human ABO blood group system; persons with type AB blood have one allele for A and one for B. (Persons with neither are type O.)
Most traits are determined by more than two alleles. Multiple forms of the allele may exist, though only two will attach to the designated gene site during meiosis. Also, some traits are controlled by two or more gene sites. Both possibilities multiply the number of alleles involved. All genetic traits are the result of the interactions of alleles. Mutation, crossing over, and environmental conditions selectively change the frequency of phenotypes (and thus their alleles) within a population. For example, alleles that are carried by individuals with high fitness (meaning they successfully reproduce and pass their genes to their offspring) have a higher likelihood of persisting in a population than alleles carried by less-fit individuals, which are gradually lost from the population over time.
