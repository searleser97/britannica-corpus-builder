Earnest A. Hooton, in full Earnest Albert Hooton,  (born November 20, 1887, Clemansville, Wisconsin, U.S.—died May 3, 1954, Cambridge, Massachusetts), American physical anthropologist who investigated human evolution and so-called racial differentiation, classified and described human populations, and examined the relationship between personality and physical type, particularly with respect to criminal behaviour. He established Harvard University as a principal U.S. centre for physical anthropology and wrote many works that stimulated popular interest in that discipline.
Hooton began teaching at Harvard in 1913 and was professor from 1930 to 1954. Many of a generation of professional American physical anthropologists were his students, and his influence was exceptional. His first major study, The Ancient Inhabitants of the Canary Islands (1925), classified prehistoric Guanche skeletons and craniums and reconstructed a history of the islands’ population. Out of his 1930 study of the skeletons of the extinct Pecos (New Mexico) pueblo, he developed a scheme of racial types that he believed constituted the Indian stock as a whole, suggesting components such as “Mediterranean” and “Negroid.”
During the 1930s he surveyed the American criminal population to attempt to determine whether criminal behaviour might be linked to physical or racial factors. His two major works in this area are The American Criminal (1939) and Crime and the Man (1939), both of which provoked considerable controversy.
Hooton’s influence extended beyond professional anthropology in his books for the general reader. Up from the Ape (1931), widely used as a textbook, was followed by Apes, Men, and Morons (1937), Why Men Behave Like Apes, and Vice-Versa (1940), and Man’s Poor Relations (1942).
