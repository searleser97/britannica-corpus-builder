Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF),  film festival held annually in July and August in Melbourne. It is Australia’s largest film festival.
The festival began in 1952 in nearby Olinda, Vic. Several film societies in Victoria collaborated on a program that emphasized the types of films that were rarely seen at the local cinema. The first festival featured movies from around the world, including films from Russia, China, and Canada. Although organizers expected a low turnout, they sold about 800 tickets. To accommodate larger audiences, the festival was moved to the Melbourne area in 1953. It eventually settled into venues around the city centre, including the Australian Centre for the Moving Image.
The MIFF runs for 17 days and attracts some 200,000 people. Many who attend are film fans, but the festival also includes a four-day conference called 37°South Market, where filmmakers, distributors, producers, and other industry insiders can network and attend workshops and lectures. The festival continues to showcase films from around the globe, screening about 400 films and shorts. Its Next Gen program features a selection of global films for young people.
The festival offers various prizes. Short films are recognized in several categories, including the Grand Prix for Best Short Film and the Award for Best Australian Short Film. The Most Popular prizes are audience choice awards for feature films and documentaries.
