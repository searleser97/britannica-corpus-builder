Berlin International Film Festival, German Internationale Filmfestspiele Berlin, also called Berlinale,  one of the world’s largest film festivals, held annually in Berlin in February.
The festival was the idea of Oscar Martay, a film officer in the U.S. military who was stationed in West Berlin after World War II. In 1950 he formed a committee that included members of the Berlin Senate and the German film industry. Together they laid the groundwork for the inaugural festival, which was held in June 1951. Alfred Hitchcock’s Rebecca (1940) was the first film shown, and its star, Joan Fontaine, was on hand. Martay was awarded a Golden Bear (Goldener Bär), the festival’s top prize, for his work in bringing the Berlinale to reality. Other prizes awarded at the first Berlinale included a Golden Bear for best music film to Cinderella (1951), which also won the festival’s audience-choice prize, the Big Bronze Plate (Grosser Bronzeteller).
Over the ensuing years, the Berlin International Film Festival expanded to include some 400 films screened over 10 days. It also added prizes, including Golden Bears for best film and short film and Silver Bear (Silberner Bär) awards for best director, actor, and actress. In 1978 the festival was moved from June to February. By the early 21st century, it was attended by about 300,000 film professionals and cinephiles. In addition to screening movies, the festival features various workshops, such as the Berlinale Talent Campus.
