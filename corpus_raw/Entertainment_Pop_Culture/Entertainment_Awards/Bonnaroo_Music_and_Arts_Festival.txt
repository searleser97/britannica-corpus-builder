Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival,  annual summer music and arts festival held in Manchester, Tennessee, U.S.
The first Bonnaroo, organized by veteran music promoter Ashley Capps and held in 2002, attracted about 70,000 visitors. The festival took its name from the 1974 album Desitively Bonnaroo by New Orleans pianist and vocalist Dr. John. In the Creole slang of New Orleans, bonnaroo means, roughly, “best on the street.”
The music performed at the festival is not limited to any locale or genre. At the four-day multistage festival, held on a 700-acre (280-hectare) farm in June, attendees can hear a variety of music—from rock and jazz to hip-hop and world music. Musical guests have included Bonnie Raitt, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Jay-Z, U2, Nick Cave, Emmylou Harris, Pearl Jam, Eminem, and Radiohead. Many of the attendees camp at the site, and a children’s area is provided by a nonprofit organization that promotes family-friendly activities at rock festivals.
A central area of the festival site, called Centeroo, is open 24 hours a day, offering food and craft vending and other activities. Bonnaroo attendees can also view films, sample specialty beers at the Broo’ers Festival, or dance all night at the Silent Disco. At this unique event, DJs play electronic music until the early morning hours, but nearby campers remain undisturbed, as the party is broadcast directly to wireless headsets worn by attendees.
In 2004 attendance topped 90,000, and ticket sales were later capped at 80,000. In 2007 event organizers bought more than 500 acres (200 hectares) of farmland, and they signed an agreement to lease more than 200 additional acres (80 hectares) for campsites, which ensured that Bonnaroo could continue at the Manchester site.
