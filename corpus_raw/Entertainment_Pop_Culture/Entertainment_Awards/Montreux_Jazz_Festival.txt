Montreux Jazz Festival,  festival of jazz and popular music, consisting primarily of concerts and competitions, held annually in Montreux, Switz.
The first Montreux Jazz Festival was held in 1967 at the Montreux Casino overlooking Lake Geneva. It was a three-day event featuring the Charles Lloyd Quartet, an American group, alongside a dozen participants in a competition for European jazz artists. Staged again the following year, the festival was extended to five days to accommodate more guest artists—most notably the American pianist Bill Evans and the American vocalist Nina Simone—and increased participation in the competition. The Montreux Jazz Festival subsequently became an annual affair, and it continued to grow, both in duration and in scope. By the late 1970s it typically spanned two weeks in early to mid-July and encompassed not only jazz but an eclectic mix of blues, gospel, soul, rock, and other popular music genres.
As the festival gained in popularity, it outgrew the Montreux Casino, and in 1993 it moved to the Montreux Convention Centre, which provided multiple auditoriums and event spaces. Meanwhile, the festival activities became increasingly diverse, embracing workshops, lectures, films, and other events. Separate competitions were established for particular instruments, and many non-European musicians joined the ranks of the contestants. A special contest—called Tremplin Lémanique (“Springboard of Lake Geneva”)—for local bands was inaugurated in 2008.  By this time the festival had spread well beyond the confines of the convention centre to nearby venues, including parks, trains, boats, and small indoor settings. Between ticketed and free events, the audience numbered in the hundreds of thousands.
