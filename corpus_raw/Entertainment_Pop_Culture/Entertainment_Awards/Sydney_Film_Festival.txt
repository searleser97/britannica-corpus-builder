Sydney Film Festival,  film festival held annually in Sydney in June. It features a diverse range of movies from around the world.
The University of Sydney hosted the first Sydney Film Festival in June 1954. It was a small three-day event with 1,200 tickets available. The first festival showed only nine feature films—including American filmmaker Buster Keaton’s classic comedy The General (1927) and films by Italian Neorealist director Roberto Rossellini and French comic director Jacques Tati—but it also included shorts and documentaries. The first festival sold out, and the following festivals quickly outgrew the university’s capabilities. In order to accommodate the larger crowds and a longer festival length, venues throughout Sydney were added.
The festival, which runs approximately two weeks, now features some 150 feature-length movies and is attended by more than 130,000 film professionals and cinephiles. In 1977 the schedule was expanded to include panel discussions and workshops, many of which are free events that aspiring filmmakers are encouraged to attend. In addition, the Travelling Film Festival, an outreach program of the Sydney Film Festival, was introduced in 1974. It is held in locations throughout Australia and offers a selection of the main festival’s movies. In 2010, for example, cities such as Darwin, Wollongong, and Alice Springs each hosted the Travelling Film Festival for three days and showcased some 10 films.
The Sydney Film Festival presents awards in several categories, including prizes for short subjects and audience favourites. In 2008 the festival began offering the Official Competition prize, a juried award given to a creative and cutting-edge film.
