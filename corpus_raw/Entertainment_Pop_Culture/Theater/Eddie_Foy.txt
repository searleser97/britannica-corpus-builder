Eddie Foy, in full Edwin Fitzgerald Foy,  (born March 9, 1856, New York City—died February 16, 1928, Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.), American comedian, actor, and vaudevillian who enjoyed success in variety shows and musicals before becoming a star on the vaudeville circuit.
As a child, he sang and danced in the streets of New York and Chicago to help support his family. He gained his first professional recognition in the mining camps and cow towns of the West, beginning around 1878. He returned to Chicago in 1888 as the star comedian in variety shows and revues. Between 1904 and 1913 he played the leading comic roles in a series of musical comedies in New York City, among them Piff! Paff! Pouf! and The Earl and the Girl. He entered vaudeville in 1913 with a highly successful act that included his seven children and appeared with them in one motion picture.
Foy retired in 1923 but returned to the stage in 1927 and died while on a farewell tour. Alvin F. Harlow coauthored Foy’s autobiography, Clowning Through Life (1928). Eddie Foy, Jr. (1905–83), Foy’s son, was active in vaudeville, films, the musical and legitimate stage, and television.
