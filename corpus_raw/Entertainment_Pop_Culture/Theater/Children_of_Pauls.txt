Children of Paul’s,   troupe of boy actors, one of the children’s companies popular in Elizabethan England. Affiliated with St. Paul’s Cathedral, the group performed in a biblical play as early as 1378. The theatrical company as such was formed under the direction (1577–82) of Sebastian Westcott. The Children of Paul’s frequently performed at court, often in plays written exclusively for their production. The troupe’s repertoire included John Marston’s What You Will, George Chapman’s Bussy d’Ambois, and John Lyly’s Sapho and Phao. The Children of Paul’s also staged plays in the cathedral’s courtyard and school hall. Their last recorded performance was in July 1606 before James I and King Christian of Denmark.
