Sir A. P. Herbert,  (born September 24, 1890, Elstead, Surrey, England—died November 11, 1971, London), English novelist, playwright, poet, and politician, author of more than 50 books, famous for his witty championing of minority causes. More importantly, as an independent member of Parliament for Oxford University (1935–50), he introduced the matrimonial causes bill (enacted in 1937), which radically amended English divorce laws.
Herbert wrote the first of his many contributions to the humorous magazine Punch while still at school (Winchester College). He graduated in law at Oxford and during World War I served in the Royal Navy. His first literary success was The Secret Battle (1919), a story of front-line warfare. Another novel, The Water Gipsies (1930), affectionately described Thames riverside life. In contrast, Holy Deadlock (1934) was frankly propagandist, aimed at the anomalies of the divorce laws. A witty lyricist, he wrote many highly successful comic operas and musicals, to which he graduated from children’s plays. Among these were Riverside Nights (1926), La Vie Parisienne (1929), Tantivy Towers (1931), Helen (1932), Derby Day (1932), Big Ben (1946), and Bless the Bride (1947). Herbert was knighted in 1945 and made a Companion of Honour in 1970, the year his last book was published, A.P.H.: His Life and Times.
