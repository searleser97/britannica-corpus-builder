Ellen DeGeneres, in full Ellen Lee DeGeneres,  (born January 26, 1958, Metairie, Louisiana, U.S.), American comedian and television host known for her quirky observational humour.
DeGeneres briefly attended the University of New Orleans, where she majored in communications. Dissatisfied with university life, she left to work in a law firm and later held a string of jobs, including waitress, bartender, house painter, and oyster shucker. After putting together a comedy routine for a group of friends, DeGeneres was asked to perform in local coffeehouses in the late 1970s. She was soon traveling through the United States on the comedy club circuit, earning applause with her quirky, naive stories that were punctuated with her loose-limbed gestures. Her style was compared to those of Mary Tyler Moore and Lucille Ball. DeGeneres’s act also caught the attention of Showtime, and the cable network named her Funniest Person of the Year in 1982. Her career hit a high note in 1986 after she was invited to perform on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Following her humorous rendition of “Phone Call to God,” Carson motioned DeGeneres to sit and chat—the first time a female comedian had been given that honour.
Besides appearing on television in stand-up comedy routines, DeGeneres had parts in such television shows as One Night Stand (1989), Open House (1989–90), and Laurie Hill (1992). In 1994 she starred in These Friends of Mine; its name changed to Ellen the following season. The show was a success, earning nominations for Golden Globe, American Comedy, and Emmy awards. In 1997 DeGeneres revealed that she was gay, and Ellen became the first prime-time show to feature an openly gay lead character. After the show ended in 1998, DeGeneres eventually moved to the daytime arena, launching her own syndicated talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, in 2003. The show earned more than 20 Daytime Emmy Awards in its first five seasons. In September 2009 it was announced that DeGeneres would be a judge on the reality series American Idol, but she left the program after just one season, saying that she felt uncomfortable criticizing the talent show’s contestants. DeGeneres leveraged her interior-design expertise on the show Ellen’s Design Challenge (2015– ) and conceptualized and coproduced the children’s talent show Little Big Shots (2016– ). She then hosted Ellen’s Game of Games (2017– ), a TV series that selected members from her daytime audience to compete in a variety of often absurd competitions. DeGeneres also emceed a number of awards shows, notably the Academy Awards in 2007 and 2014. Her first comedy special in 15 years, Ellen DeGeneres: Relatable, premiered on Netflix in 2018.
In addition to her television work, DeGeneres appeared in such films as Coneheads (1993), Mr. Wrong (1996), and the animated feature film Finding Nemo (2003), in which she provided the voice of the forgetful but lovable Dory, a blue tang, a type of reef fish. She reprised the latter role in the sequel Finding Dory (2016). Her comedic essays were collected in the best-selling books My Point…and I Do Have One (1995), The Funny Thing Is… (2003), and Seriously…I’m Kidding (2011). She chronicled her various architectural renovation projects in the illustrated volume Home (2015).
In 2012 DeGeneres received the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, and four years later she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She received the Carol Burnett Award (a Golden Globe honouring excellence in television) in 2020.
