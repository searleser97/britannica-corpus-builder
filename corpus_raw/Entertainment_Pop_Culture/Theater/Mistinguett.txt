Mistinguett, original name Jeanne-marie Bourgeois,  (born April 5, 1875, Enghien-les-Bains, France—died  Jan. 5, 1956, Bougival), popular French comedienne noted especially for her beautiful legs and stage personality. 
The name Mistinguett (Miss Tinguett), derived from a song in a musical show, Miss Helyett, was suggested by her allegedly English-looking, protruding front teeth. Her greatest fame was achieved in Paris in spectacular revues at the Moulin Rouge and the Casino de Paris. She often appeared with Maurice Chevalier, and her best-remembered songs are “Mon Homme” (“My Man”) and “J’en ai marre” (“I’ve Had Enough of It”). Her long career included appearances in London and the Americas.
Mistinguett was not highly talented as a dancer, nor did she have a good voice; but she had vitality and conviction, and even in old age she was able to play young parts. She wrote Toute ma vie (1954; Mistinguett, Queen of the Paris Night).
