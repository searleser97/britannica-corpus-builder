Teatro Farnese,  Italian Baroque theatre at Parma, Italy, the prototype of the modern playhouse and the first surviving theatre with a permanent proscenium arch. Construction on the Teatro Farnese was begun in 1618 by Giovanni Battista Aleotti for Ranuccio I Farnese, and it officially opened in 1628. At one end of the large, rectangular wooden structure was a stage area designed for deep-perspective scenery and spectacular effects. The stage area, divided in half by two half walls, had provision for three sets of side wings and a back shutter in the front and four sets of wings or shutters in the rear. A proscenium arch, placed at the front of the stage, was decorated with paintings and statues set into niches. A large U-shaped open area (pit, or parterre) was used for dancing, royal processions, and other courtly entertainments; it could even be flooded for water spectacles. Rows of benches ringed this area in a stadium fashion. Above the benches were two rows of arches topped by a small gallery with statues. The Farnese was renovated in the early 1700s by Filippo Juvarra and rebuilt following its destruction during World War II.
