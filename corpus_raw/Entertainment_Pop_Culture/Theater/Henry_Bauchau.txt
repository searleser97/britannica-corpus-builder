Henry Bauchau,  (born January 22, 1913, Mechelen, Belgium—died September 21, 2012, Louveciennes, France), Belgian novelist, poet, and playwright who was also a practicing psychoanalyst. Like his contemporary Dominique Rolin but unusually for a Belgian writer, Bauchau took his inspiration from psychoanalysis.
Bauchau studied law and began writing for periodicals. After World War II he worked in publishing and founded a school in Switzerland. He published his first book, Géologie (1958; “Geology”), at age 45. This was followed by the play Gengis Khan (1960), which, like his later play La Machination (1969; “The Plot”), expresses a Neoclassical skepticism. In the poems of La Chine intérieure (1974; “Inner China”), Bauchau’s use of language is instrumental in aiding the processes of memory and introspection. His first novel, La Déchirure (1966; “The Tear”), is a multileveled narrative on the loss of his mother viewed against a backdrop of Belgian social change. Le Régiment noir (1972; “The Black Regiment”) follows an exiled European among African American soldiers in the American Civil War. Œdipe sur la route (1990; Oedipus on the Road) is a post-Freudian version of the Greek tragic hero’s transformation in the 20 years that elapse between Sophocles’ accounts of events at Thebes and Colonus. Diotime et les lions (1991; “Diotima and the Lions”) and Antigone (1997) extend the Oedipal theme. Bauchau also published the journals Jour après jour: journal 1983–1989 (1992; “Day After Day: Journal 1983–1989”) and Étés: journaux (1997; “Summers: Journals”), and a collection of his poetry, Poésie, 1950–1984, appeared in 1986.
