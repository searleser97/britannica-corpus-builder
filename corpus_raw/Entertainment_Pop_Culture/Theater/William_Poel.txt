William Poel, original name William Pole,  (born July 22, 1852, London, England—died December 13, 1934, London), English actor, theatre manager, and producer who revolutionized modern Shakespearean production by returning to Elizabethan staging.
Poel was reared among the Pre-Raphaelite artists, and as a boy he posed for William Holman Hunt. He early decided to go on the stage. After working for a time as an actor, stage manager, and theatre manager, he founded the Elizabethan Stage Society (1894–1905), which by holding performances free of scenery and modern staging approximated the theatrical conditions under which Shakespeare wrote. Using largely amateur casts, no scenery, and an Elizabethan open-platform stage, Poel’s productions were distinguished by swift and musical speech, continuity of action in nonlocalized scenes, fidelity to Shakespeare’s words, and a more intimate relationship between the actors and the audience. He produced 17 plays by Shakespeare in this manner. Poel’s staging methods were perhaps the single most important influence on what became the accepted approach to Shakespearean production in the 20th century. His work at the Elizabethan Stage Society also included the revival of works by Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, and Beaumont and Fletcher. Among his own writings are several plays and Shakespeare in the Theatre (1913). He twice declined the offer of a knighthood.
