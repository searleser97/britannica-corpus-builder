Clyde Beatty, in full Clyde Raymond Beatty,  (born June 10, 1903, Bainbridge, Ohio, U.S.—died July 19, 1965, Ventura, California), American wild animal trainer known for his “fighting act,” designed to show his courage and mastery of the ferocious animals under his control. In one of the most-daring acts in circus history, he mixed 40 lions and tigers of both sexes. He also used dangerous combinations of tigers, lions, leopards, pumas, hyenas, and bears.
Beatty left home at age 18 to join the circus, in his case Howe’s Great London and Van Amburgh’s Wild Animal Circus, for which he took a job as a circus cage attendant. A year later he had the opportunity to work with polar bears and to learn from Peter Taylor, one of the great big-cat trainers of the era. From 1925 through 1934 Beatty toured with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, handling both polar bears and big cats. It was for Hagenbeck in 1930 that he designed his best-known act and trained 40 lions and tigers for it. From 1931 through 1934 he appeared with the combined Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in its New York City and Boston appearances. His act was billed as the “sensation of the century, greatest and most daring wild animal act ever presented.” He returned to Hagenbeck for the rest of the season. He also performed with the Cole Bros. circus from 1935 through 1938. From 1936 to 1945 Beatty operated the Clyde Beatty Jungle Zoo near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Beatty purchased a circus in 1945 that in 1958 bought the Cole Bros. name and formed the Clyde Beatty–Cole Bros. Circus, which was the largest tent show on the road in the United States at that time.
In addition to his circus work, Beatty was active in many other fields. He appeared in several motion pictures—including The Big Cage (1933, based on his own book by that name), Darkest Africa (1936, a 15-episode series), Africa Screams (1949, with Abbott and Costello), Perils of the Jungle (1953), and Ring of Fear (1954, featuring mystery writer Mickey Spillane)—in all of which he played himself and revealed what made him such a popular figure. A compelling 52-episode radio program called The Clyde Beatty Show aired from December 11, 1950, to January 18, 1952. The program—voiced by actors—was centred on Beatty’s career, and some of its episodes were based on real-life events. Books by Beatty include The Big Cage (1933; with Edward Anthony), Jungle Performers (1941; with Earl Wilson), and Facing the Big Cats: My World of Lions and Tigers (1965; with Edward Anthony).
