Eccyclema, Greek Ekkyklēma, also called Exostra,  in classical Greek theatre, stage mechanism consisting of a low platform that rolled on wheels or revolved on an axis and could be pushed onstage to reveal an interior or some offstage scene such as a tableau. It was introduced to the Attic stage in the 5th century to provide directors a means for clarifying the action. Because violence was prohibited from the Greek stage, it is thought by some that murdered bodies may have been displayed on the device.
The eccyclema was used mainly in tragedy but was occasionally employed in comedy. In the Acharnians by Aristophanes, for example, a character representing the playwright Euripides is reluctant to leave his house until Dicaeopolis, who wants to borrow a costume, brings him the “scene shifter” to wheel him onstage surrounded by costumes. After violence was no longer proscribed onstage, the eccyclema still served as a scene-shifting device, eventually giving rise to modern turntables and other revolving stage mechanisms.
