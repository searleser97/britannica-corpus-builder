Christopher Beeston,  (born c. 1580—died c. Oct. 15, 1638, London, Eng.), English actor and theatrical manager who was one of the most influential figures in the English theatre in the early 17th century.
Nothing is known of Beeston’s early life. In 1598 he appeared in Ben Jonson’s Every Man In His Humour with William Shakespeare, Augustine Phillips, and Richard Burbage, and in 1602 he was with Worcester’s Men. Beeston remained with them after they became Queen Anne’s Men in 1603, and he succeeded Thomas Greene as their business manager in 1612. In 1616 he established them at his theatre, The Cockpit (later the Phoenix), in Drury Lane, where he remained for the rest of his life as manager to the succeeding companies. Beeston held two-thirds of the shares, owned the costumes, and retained control of the plays he had bought, practices that brought him a reputation for shrewdness. In 1637 he formed the King’s and Queen’s Young Company, more popularly known as Beeston’s Boys, a company that was established by royal warrant. Beeston was a lifelong friend of Thomas Heywood and produced many of his plays and also contributed verses to Heywood’s prose work An Apology for Actors (1612).
After Beeston’s death, his son William (1606?–82) managed Beeston’s Boys for short periods before the closing of the theatres in 1642 and after their reopening in 1660 at Salisbury Court and the Cockpit. Records of the period suggest he had considerable influence in injecting elements of Elizabethan acting styles into the early Restoration theatre.
