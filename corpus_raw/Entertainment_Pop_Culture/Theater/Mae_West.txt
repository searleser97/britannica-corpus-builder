Mae West, original name Mary Jane West,  (born August 17, 1893, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died November 22, 1980, Los Angeles, California), American stage and film actress, a sex symbol whose frank sensuality, languid postures, and blasé wisecracking became her trademarks. She usually portrayed women who accepted their lives of dubious virtue with flippant good humour.
West made her debut with a Brooklyn stock company about 1901, and by 1907 she had become a performer on the national vaudeville circuit in partnership with Frank Wallace. She made her Broadway debut as a singer and acrobatic dancer in the revue A la Broadway in 1911. For the next 15 years she alternated between vaudeville and Broadway shows, and she did an occasional nightclub act.
In 1926 West began to write, produce, and star in her own plays on Broadway. In the first of these, Sex (1926), her performance as a prostitute created a sensation but also earned her an eight-day jail sentence for “corrupting the morals of youth,” from which she emerged a national figure. Her plays Diamond Lil (1928) and The Constant Sinner (1931) were also successful. For all the variety of the scripts she wrote, the constant factor was West’s own ironic, languorous personality and her ability to ridicule social attitudes, especially toward sex.
In 1932 West moved to Hollywood. Her first film there, Night After Night (1932), showed the lighthearted approach that was characteristic of her subsequent pictures. She Done Him Wrong (1933), a screen adaptation of Diamond Lil, is memorable for her amusing ability to charge such lines as “Why don’t you come up sometime and see me?” with suggestive implications. West then wrote and costarred in I’m No Angel (1933), Belle of the Nineties (1934), and Klondike Annie (1936), which brought her popularity to its height. After two more films, she starred with W.C. Fields in the comic western My Little Chickadee (1940), whose script she wrote with him. During World War II, Allied soldiers called their inflatable life jackets “Mae Wests” in honour of her hourglass figure. In the 1940s and ’50s she sometimes appeared onstage surrounded by young musclemen, including on Broadway in Catherine Was Great (1944).
Her films were revived in the 1960s, and she appeared in Myra Breckinridge (1970), an adaptation of a novel by Gore Vidal, and Sextette (1978), based on a play that she wrote. The title of her autobiography, Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It (1959), captured her style precisely—it was a retort one of her characters made to the exclamation “Goodness, what beautiful diamonds!”
