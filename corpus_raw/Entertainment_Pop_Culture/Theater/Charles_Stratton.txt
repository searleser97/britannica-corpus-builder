General Tom Thumb, pseudonym of Charles Stratton,  (born January 4, 1838, Bridgeport, Connecticut, U.S.—died July 15, 1883, Middleboro, Massachusetts), American showman noted for his small stature. He was the first major attraction promoted by the circus impresario P.T. Barnum.
Born to parents of normal stature, Charles Stratton ceased growing at the age of six months and remained 25 inches (0.6 metre) tall, weighing 15 pounds (7 kg), until his teens. He later grew to 40 inches (1 metre) and 70 pounds (32 kg). He was not quite five years old when Barnum hired him for his museum, but Barnum publicized him as General Tom Thumb, an 11-year-old dwarf from England. He quickly became a celebrated figure in the United States and abroad. In 1863 Stratton married Lavinia Warren (1841–1919)—another of Barnum’s performers, known as the “Little Queen of Beauty”—in an elaborately staged ceremony at Grace Episcopal Church in New York City.
