Drury Lane Theatre, in full Theatre Royal Drury Lane,  oldest London theatre still in use. It stands in the eastern part of the City of Westminster.
The first theatre was built by the dramatist Thomas Killigrew for his company of actors as the Theatre Royal under a charter from Charles II. It opened May 7, 1663, in the propitious era of Restoration drama, and produced plays by John Dryden, among others. It was closed in 1665–66 but then prospered until being destroyed by fire (1672). Rebuilt on its present site in Drury Lane in 1674 with Sir Christopher Wren as its probable architect, the second Theatre Royal soon featured the works of William Congreve.
Drury Lane enjoyed one of its finest periods (1710/11–33) under the control of the famous triumvirate made up of the actor-playwright Colley Cibber, the comedian Robert Wilks, the character actor Thomas Doggett (until 1713), and (from 1713) the actor Barton Booth. It then fell into the hands of a spendthrift, Charles Fleetwood, whose mismanagement almost brought the theatre to ruin, despite such triumphs as Charles Macklin’s revolutionary portrayal of Shylock as a tragic rather than comic character. It was rescued in 1747 when David Garrick took over and opened with a brilliant new troupe, a more natural style of acting and production, and superior Shakespearean texts. Garrick upheld these high standards for the next 30 years. He was succeeded by Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Under his management (1776–88) The School for Scandal held the stage, and the performances of Sarah Siddons as Lady Macbeth and John Philip Kemble as Hamlet were given. The second theatre was demolished in 1791.
When a new “fireproof” theatre, built in 1791–94 to the designs of Henry Holland, burned down in 1809, another was designed by Benjamin Wyatt and opened in 1812. In this era the actor Edmund Kean attracted large audiences. After his decline Drury Lane went into a long period of progressive deterioration until it was taken over by Augustus Harris in 1879. In the 1880s and ’90s it again prospered as the home of grand melodramas and of pantomimes staged by Harris. His successor, Arthur Collins, profited from the production of a similar repertoire. In the 1900s it was the scene of notable performances by Sir Henry Irving, Ellen Terry, and Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson. The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham’s great opera seasons were held there. Beginning in the mid-1920s, the theatre also featured musicals. During World War II it was the headquarters of ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association).
On May 7, 1963, the Drury Lane celebrated its tercentenary. Notable presentations in the late 20th century included Mame (1969); The Pirates of Penzance (1982); and Miss Saigon, which opened there in 1989 and continued through the late 1990s.
