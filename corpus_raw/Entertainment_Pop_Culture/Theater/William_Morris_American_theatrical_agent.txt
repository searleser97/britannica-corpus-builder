William Morris,  (born 1873, Schwarzenau, Ger.—died  Nov. 2, 1932, New York City), U.S. theatrical agent and manager who opposed the attempted monopoly of vaudeville talent in the early 20th century.
Morris was hired by Klaw and Erlanger, heads of a legitimate theatre trust, to book vaudeville acts for their theatre chain. This position put him in conflict with the Keith-Albee United Bookings Office, which sought to monopolize variety talent. Though Keith-Albee was forced to buy out Klaw and Erlanger, stipulating that they stay out of vaudeville for 10 years, the independent Morris was still free to harass them. He continued to manage theatrical acts, with the popular Harry Lauder as his chief attraction. When theatres were closed to Lauder, Morris appealed to “trust-busting” Pres. Theodore Roosevelt, who requested that Lauder be allowed to appear in Washington, D.C., and personally attended the performance.
Morris, with strong support from the theatrical trade paper Variety, finally won his case against theatrical monopolies. He founded the William Morris Agency, one of the foremost theatrical agencies in the country. His son, William Morris, Jr. (born Oct. 22, 1899, New York City) later became president of the agency (1932–52) and from 1952 served as a director.
