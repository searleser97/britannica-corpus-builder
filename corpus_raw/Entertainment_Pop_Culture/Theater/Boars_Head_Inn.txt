Boar’s Head Inn,   London inn, the yard of which was used to stage plays in the 16th and early 17th centuries. It was situated in Whitechapel, just outside Aldgate. The first record of its use as a playhouse was in 1557. In 1595 Oliver Woodliffe began a four-year renovation of the inn, which marked the first time a London inn underwent extensive alterations for the purpose of accommodating plays. A roof and a tiring-house were added and the galleries were expanded.
Designed to compete with the Rose and Globe theatres, the Boar’s Head for a few years became the favourite house of Queen Anne’s Men. In 1605, however, that company moved to the Red Bull Theatre, and the inn’s subsequent history was without distinction. By 1621 it was no longer in use as a theatre.
