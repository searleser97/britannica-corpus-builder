In New York City he became successful as a songwriter (1912–17) and then as a producer and opened his first Earl Carroll Theatre in 1922; there and at a second Earl Carroll Theatre built in 1931 he produced 15 Vanities and two Sketch Book Reviews in the coming years. In 1938 he built his restaurant (including a theatre) in Hollywood and put on 12 more Vanities. Over the years he also produced or directed more than 60 Broadway and other plays and a few motion pictures. He died in the crash of a commercial airliner.
