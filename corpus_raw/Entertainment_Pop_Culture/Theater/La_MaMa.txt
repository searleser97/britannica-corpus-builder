La MaMa, in full La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, also called La MaMa E.T.C.,  nonprofit institution founded in New York City in 1961 that is a leader in avant-garde and Off-Off-Broadway theatre and the presentation of work by international theatre groups. It provides residence, rehearsal space, theatres, office space, and an archive of Off-Off-Broadway theatre.
La MaMa was established in the East Village as Café La MaMa by American theatre enthusiast Ellen Stewart (known as Mama), the fashion designer who was La MaMa’s director from its establishment in 1961 until her death in 2011. In 1963 Stewart relocated and changed the name of the organization. Four years later La MaMa gained nonprofit status, and in 1969 it moved once again, to its permanent location at 74A East 4th Street, which holds two theatres, First Floor Theatre and the Club (located on the second floor). Five years later Stewart opened an associated performance space she called the Annex (now the Ellen Stewart Theatre), located just down the street from La MaMa. Stewart dedicated La MaMa “to the playwright and all aspects of the theatre,” as she herself announced at the start of La MaMa performances. In 1985 she was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship (“genius” grant).
Several notable young avant-garde ensembles, including Mabou Mines, Ping Chong & Company, the Great Jones Repertory, and the American Indian Theatre Ensemble, played at La MaMa. Among the many artists who presented works or performed there are playwrights Harvey Fierstein, Sam Shepard, and Lanford Wilson; actors Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Nick Nolte; and many others such as writer and composer Elizabeth Swados, composer Philip Glass, dramatist and producer Robert Wilson, and entertainer Bette Midler.
