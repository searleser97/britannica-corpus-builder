George Jessel,  (born April 3, 1898, New York City—died  May 24, 1981, Los Angeles), American comedian, actor, writer, composer, and producer, whose skill as a dinner speaker earned him the honorary title of Toastmaster General of the United States.
Jessel began his career at the age of nine, after his father’s death. He toured vaudeville and variety theatres in the United States and England, developing a popular act that combined comedy, nostalgia, and sentimental songs. During the 1920s and ’30s he concentrated on a stage career as a composer, writer, and producer and as the star of several plays, including the original 1925 production of The Jazz Singer, The War Song (1928), Joseph (1930), and High Kickers (1941), the last of which he coauthored with Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby. In 1943 he moved to California, and for the next 10 years he produced Hollywood motion pictures, among them the musicals The Dolly Sisters (1945) and Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie (1952).
Although he appeared frequently on television in the ’50s, Jessel devoted most of the remainder of his life to delivering eulogies and to serving as master of ceremonies and dinner speaker for numerous political and social causes. In 1970 he received a special Academy Award for his humanitarian work. Jessel’s books include an autobiography, So Help Me (1943), several anecdotal memoirs, and guides to public speaking.
