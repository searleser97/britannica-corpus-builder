Comus,  masque by John Milton, presented on Sept. 29, 1634, before John Egerton, earl of Bridgewater, at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire, and published anonymously in 1637. Milton wrote the text in honour of the earl becoming lord president of Wales and the Marches at the suggestion of the composer Henry Lawes, who wrote the music for it and played a part in the first production. The earl’s three children took the leading roles, with the earl and his countess appearing in the final scene. Comus is a masque against “masquing,” contrasting a private heroism in chastity and virtue with the courtly round of revelry and pleasure. It was Milton’s first dramatizing of his great theme, the conflict of good and evil.
The allegorical story centres on a virtuous Lady who becomes separated from her two brothers while traveling in the woods. The Lady encounters the evil sorcerer Comus, son of Bacchus and Circe, who imprisons her by magic in his palace. In debate the Lady rejects Comus’s hedonistic philosophy and defends temperance and chastity. She is eventually freed by the two brothers, with the help of the Attendant Spirit and the river nymph Sabrina.
With his 1738 production of John Dalton’s adaptation of Comus at Drury Lane Theatre in London, Thomas Arne established himself as a leading English lyric composer.
