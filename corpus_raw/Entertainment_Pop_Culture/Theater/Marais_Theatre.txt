Marais Theatre, French Théâtre Du Marais,  one of the major theatrical companies in 17th-century France. With the actor Montdory as its head, the company performed at various temporary theatres in Paris from 1629 before finding a permanent home in a converted tennis court in the Marais district in 1634. The Marais Theatre presented Pierre Corneille’s early comedies and gave the first production of Corneille’s Le Cid in 1637. It rapidly replaced the King’s Players at the Hôtel de Bourgogne as the leading company of Paris. Bad health forced Montdory to leave the Marais Theatre in 1637, however, and under his successor, Floridor, the company turned increasingly to popular farces, usually featuring the comedian Jodelet.
The original Marais Theatre burned in 1644 and was rebuilt to accommodate the complex theatre machinery that had been growing increasingly popular in France. Floridor left the company in 1647 to join the Hôtel de Bourgogne troupe, and the actor Laroque assumed leadership. In an attempt to compete with the Bourgogne and Molière troupes, Laroque promoted spectacular productions, but little money was made, and in 1673 Louis XIV ordered the theatre closed. The Marais troupe was combined with the Molière troupe and moved to a theatre in the rue Guénégaud. In 1680 another royal order combined the Bourgogne troupe with that of the Guénégaud, creating the first modern national theatre—the Comédie-Française.
