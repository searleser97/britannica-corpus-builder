Percy MacKaye,  (born March 16, 1875, New York City, New York, U.S.—died August 31, 1956, Cornish, New Hampshire), American poet and playwright whose use of historical and contemporary folk literature furthered the development of the pageant in the U.S.
MacKaye was introduced to the theatre at an early age by his father, actor Steele MacKaye, with whom he first collaborated. Graduating from Harvard University in 1897, he studied abroad for two years and returned to the United States to write and lecture. In 1912 he published The Civic Theatre, in which he advocated amateur community theatricals. He attempted to bring poetry and drama to large participant groups and to unite the stage arts, music, and poetry by the use of masques and communal chanting. He wrote, among others, the pageants The Canterbury Pilgrims (published in 1903) and, as co-author, St. Louis: A Civic Masque (performed in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1914 with 7,500 participants).
A trip to the Kentucky mountains in 1921 stimulated MacKaye’s interest in folk literature. In 1929 he became advisory editor to Folk-Say, a journal of American folklore; he also conducted research in collaboration with his wife, Marion Morse MacKaye; and taught poetry and folklore at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. His most noteworthy contributions to American drama and pageantry are The Scarecrow (1908), a historical play; Caliban (1916), an elaborate pageant-masque; This Fine Pretty World (1923), a regional play; and The Mystery of Hamlet: King of Denmark (1949), a study of past and present tragedy seen by a contemporary American poet.
