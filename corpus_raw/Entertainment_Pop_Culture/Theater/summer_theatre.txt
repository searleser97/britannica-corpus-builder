Summer theatre, also called summer stock, or strawhat theatre,  in American theatre, productions staged during the summer months (the off-season for professional theatre) by professional touring companies at theatres generally located near resort areas.
Usually featuring a well-known star, summer-theatre plays are often Broadway hits of previous seasons or new plays being tested for the Broadway stage. The original concept of summer theatre, dating from the late 19th century, was to combine Broadway talent with young unknown actors, giving them experience in the professional theatre.
There are more than 300 summer theatres in the United States, including tents, permanent theatres, and showboats housing musical revues. Some of the better-known theatres are the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pa.; the Westport Country Playhouse in Westport, Conn.; and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Ore.
