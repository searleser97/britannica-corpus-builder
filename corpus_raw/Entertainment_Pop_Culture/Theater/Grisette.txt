Grisette,  stock character in numerous 19th-century French novels, a pretty young woman who usually works as a laundress, milliner, or seamstress and who is an easy sexual conquest. Typically, such a character is hardworking and lighthearted, her cheerful disposition sometimes masking hunger or malnutrition. She represents a woman who can laugh easily and is always interested in having a good time. She is not averse to a casual romantic or sexual encounter and remains faithful to her lover for the duration of the affair, making no demands on him after the fling has ended.
Examples of this character appear in works such as Mimi Pinson by Alfred de Musset and Henri Murger’s Scènes de la vie de bohème (“Scenes of Bohemian Life”), the story on which Giacomo Puccini’s opera La Bohème is based.
