Palais-Royal Theatre, French Théâtre Du Palais-royal,  Paris playhouse most noted for 17th-century productions by Molière.
The Palais-Royal traces its history to a small private theatre in the residence of Cardinal Richelieu. Designed by architect Jacques Lemercier, this theatre became known by the name of the residence, the Palais-Cardinal; it was the first theatre in France with movable scenery wings and a permanent proscenium arch. It opened, with the royal court attending, with a production of Jean Desmarets’s Mirame in 1641. Following Richelieu’s death, the palace became royal property, and, as the Palais-Royal, the theatre was used for courtly entertainments. In 1660 the theatre was given to Molière and his troupe, who occupied it until the dramatist-actor’s death in 1673. Jean-Baptiste Lully requisitioned the Palais-Royal for his Royal Academy of Music, and it became the home for his opera productions. The theatre burned down in 1763 and was rebuilt, only to burn again in 1781. The entire area was then redeveloped into an amusement area by its owner, the Duke de Chartres. It contained a number of theatres, many called Palais-Royal at various times. One of these, which had opened in 1790 as the Variétés-Amusantes, was renamed the Théâtre de la République by the actor François-Joseph Talma and his compatriots during the Revolution; under Napoleon it was made the home of the Comédie-Française and became known as the Théâtre-Français. In 1831 a theatre at the opposite end of the palace was renamed the Théâtre du Palais-Royal; it was dedicated to popular comedy.
