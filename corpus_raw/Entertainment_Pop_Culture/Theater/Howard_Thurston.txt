Howard Thurston,  (born July 20, 1869, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.—died  April 13, 1936, Miami, Fla.), American magician who led the largest magic show in history.
Thurston was originally a card manipulator and toured the world (1904–07) with a full-evening show. He returned to the United States to become successor to Harry Kellar, the leading American magician. For more than 20 years he toured with a three-hour show and became best-known for his large stage illusions, such as the “floating lady.” In 1931 he shortened his program to appear as the stage attraction at motion-picture theatres. He wrote My Life of Magic (1929).
