Hat cheo,   Vietnamese peasant theatre. It is generally (though not always) played out-of-doors in the forecourt of a village communal house. It is basically satirical in intent. Performances are given by amateur touring groups whose acting is realistic, rather than stylized. The popular theatre repertoire includes plays with historical and legendary themes, social satires, and farces.
