Joseph Anton Stranitzky,  (born 1676, Graz?, Austria—died  May 19, 1726, Vienna), actor and manager of the indigenous Austrian popular theatre, who developed the improvisational character Hanswurst.
Stranitzky began his career as an itinerant puppeteer. After his arrival in Vienna (c. 1705) he formed his own company, which performed burlesques and farces in German, often based on Italian libretti. By 1711 he and his troupe had become so popular that they were allowed to take possession of Vienna’s newly constructed Kärntnertor theatre that same year, thus making it the first permanent home of German-language comedy.
Stranitzky’s success rested in large part on his portrayal of Hanswurst, the sly, knowing, Viennese servant character he adopted and modified to provide opportunity for improvised comedy within vernacular, coarsely humorous plays called Haupt und Staatsaktionen (“chief and state plays”). Fourteen of these plays attributable to Stranitzky still exist; they reveal how he adapted opera libretti for his materials. A year before his death, Stranitzky called Gottfried Prehauser to Vienna to portray Hanswurst and manage the company, but the character was already so popular that it had been copied, costume and all, by comedians throughout Austria and Germany. Hanswurst was further modified by Franz Schuch at midcentury but disappeared with the decline in popularity of improvised comedy at the end of the 18th century.
