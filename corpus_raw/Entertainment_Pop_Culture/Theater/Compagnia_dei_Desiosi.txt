Compagnia dei Desiosi,  one of the Italian acting troupes performing commedia dell’arte (improvised popular comedy) in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. This period is considered the golden age of the genre, and the performers were noted for their sophistication and varied skills. The Desiosi’s director, Diana da Ponti, was well known both as an actress and as a poet. The name Desiosi means “the desired.” Cardinal Montalto was the company’s patron. Documents of the Desiosi’s activities go back to 1581, including tours of Mantua, Cremona, Verona, Milan, Bologna, Genoa, and Rome. The actor Tristano Martinelli, renowned for his portrayal of the mischievous servant Arlecchino, performed with the Desiosi until he left the company to assume a leadership role with the Accesi, another great company of the time.
