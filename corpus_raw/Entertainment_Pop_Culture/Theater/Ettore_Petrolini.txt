Ettore Petrolini,  (born Jan. 13, 1886, Rome, Italy—died June 29, 1936, Rome), Italian theatrical actor and author, creator of numerous caricature sketches, and inventor of a revolutionary and anticonformist way of performing.
Petrolini was the son of a blacksmith, and he did not receive training in the theatre. As an adolescent he discovered his innate gift for acting and made his professional debut at age 15. In cafés, dance halls, and barns throughout Italy, he worked primarily as a macchiettista (caricaturist), lampooning stock Italian types and domestic situations in one-man vignettes. Petrolini’s engaging personality and his talent for vocal mimicry endeared provincial audiences, used to broad jokes and double entendres, to his brand of lighthearted nonsense. By age 20 he was well known throughout Italy.
He attained some international fame during the 1900s and 1910s as a result of successful tours of South America and well-received performances in New York City and Paris. In 1912 he created his own theatrical company, which he christened the Ettore Petrolini Company in the 1920s. He used this vehicle to debut his sketches until the late ’20s, when he devoted more attention to full-length prose plays. His company staged several major works of contemporary theatre, and in 1930 Petrolini’s own comedy Benedetto fra le donne (“Blessed Among Women”) was produced at the Drama Lover’s Theatre in Milan.
Having become famous throughout Europe, Petrolini completed several international tours in the 1930s. He also acted in many silent and sound films. Of these, it is Nerone (1930; “Nero”), an anthology of his best-developed characterizations, that best captures Petrolini’s range and engaging personality. In addition, he wrote several books, including an autobiography, Abbasso Petrolini (1922; “Down with Petrolini”), and a collection of miscellaneous writings, Al mio pubblico (1937; “To My Public”), published posthumously.
