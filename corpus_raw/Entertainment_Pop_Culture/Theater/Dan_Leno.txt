Dan Leno, original name George Galvin,  (born Dec. 20, 1860, London, Eng.—died Oct. 31, 1904, London), popular English entertainer who is considered the foremost representative of the British music hall at its height in the 19th century. In 1901 Leno gave a command performance for King Edward VII, becoming the first music-hall performer to be so honoured.
Born into a family of traveling entertainers, Leno first appeared onstage at age three as a tumbler and contortionist. Within five years he achieved prominence as a clog dancer with an act that included singing and comic patter. From 1888 until his death, Leno was the star of the Drury Lane’s annual Christmas pantomime and played to sell-out crowds in music halls throughout England the rest of the year. His wistful and comic caricatures endeared him to audiences. His ghostwritten autobiography appeared in 1901.
