Theatre of the Vieux-Colombier,  French theatre founded in Paris in 1913 by the writer and critic Jacques Copeau to present alternatives to both the realistic “well-made” plays of the time and the star system of actor-celebrities. Copeau sought to renovate French theatre by focusing attention on the actor, whom he viewed as the essential element in translating the dramatic text into the “poetry of the theatre.” He assembled a group of young actors that included Charles Dullin, Suzanne Bing, and Louis Jouvet, who was also his principal stage manager. Copeau and Jouvet designed a small (400-seat) theatre with a permanent stage setting and without the proscenium that separated actors and audience.
The Vieux-Colombier opened in October 1913. By May 1914 Copeau had produced 15 plays, including works by Molière, Shakespeare, and several modern writers. From 1917 to 1919 Copeau moved his company to New York City. Returning to Paris after World War I, he founded a drama school in association with the theatre. In 1924 he left the Vieux-Colombier, and thereafter the theatre was used by various acting companies. In 1961 it was renamed the Theatre of the Vieux-Colombier-Jacques Copeau.
