Tony Pastor, in full Antonio Pastor,  (born May 28, 1837, New York, New York, U.S.—died  August 26, 1908, Elmhurst, New York), American impresario and comic singer, considered the father of vaudeville in the United States.
An entertainer from the age of six, Pastor appeared at P.T. Barnum’s American Museum in New York City as a child prodigy and then appeared in minstrel shows and in the circus before he first performed in a variety show in 1861. He opened his own variety theatre in New York City in 1865 and the Fourteenth Street Theatre (New York City) in 1881. Though at the time variety shows featured coarse humour and were considered to be unsuitable entertainment for ladies, Pastor advertised his Fourteenth Street Theatre as “the first specialty and vaudeville theatre of America, catering to polite tastes, aiming to amuse, and fully up to current times and topics.” His unexpected success encouraged other theatre managers to adopt his code of prohibitions, and a more wholesome form of vaudeville soon replaced the earlier form.
