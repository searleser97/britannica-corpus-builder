The Theatre,  first public playhouse of London, located in the parish of St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch.
Designed and built by James Burbage (the father of actor Richard Burbage), The Theatre was a roofless, circular building with three galleries surrounding a yard. It opened in 1576, and several companies performed there, including Leicester’s Men (1576–78), the Admiral’s Men (1590–91), and Chamberlain’s Men (1594–96), who were associated with William Shakespeare. The Theatre also housed fencing and athletic competitions. After the death of James Burbage in February 1597, The Theatre’s lease ended. The building was dismantled in 1598, and Burbage’s sons, Cuthbert and Richard, used its timbers to construct the first Globe Theatre. In 2008, archaeologists affiliated with the Museum of London announced that they had discovered the foundations of what they believed to be The Theatre.
