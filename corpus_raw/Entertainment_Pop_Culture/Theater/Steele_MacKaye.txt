Steele MacKaye,  (born June 6, 1842, Buffalo—died February 25, 1894, Timpas, Colo., U.S.), U.S. playwright, actor, theatre manager, and inventor who has been called the closest approximation to a Renaissance man produced by the United States in the 19th century.
In his youth he studied painting with Hunt, Inness, and Troyon. A pupil of Delsarte and Régnier, he was the first American to act Hamlet in London (1873). At Harvard, Cornell, and elsewhere he lectured on the philosophy of aesthetics. In New York City he founded the St. James, Madison Square, and Lyceum theatres.
MacKaye wrote 30 plays, including Hazel Kirke, performed many thousands of times, Paul Kauvar, and Money Mad, acting in them in 17 different roles. He organized the first school of acting in the U.S, which later became the American Academy of Dramatic Art; initiated overhead lighting (1874); invented the first moving “double stage” (1879); and invented folding theatre seats. In all, he patented over 100 theatrical inventions.
For the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893, MacKaye projected the world’s largest theatre, his Spectatorium (seating 12,000, with 25 moving stages), revolutionizing stage production and anticipating motion pictures. Financial difficulties prevented completion of the theatre, but a scale model was later successfully demonstrated.
His two-volume biography, Epoch: The Life of Steele MacKaye (1927), written by his son Percy, was reprinted in 1968.
