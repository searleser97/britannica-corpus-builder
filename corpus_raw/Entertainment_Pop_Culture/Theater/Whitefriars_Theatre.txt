Whitefriars Theatre,  private London playhouse located in the priory of the Whitefriars monastery on the north side of the River Thames. Michael Drayton and Thomas Woodford converted the refectory hall to a private theatre in 1606, perhaps inspired by the conversion of the Blackfriars 30 years earlier. Both of these early private playhouses were roofed and used artificial light. Although the price of admission was higher than that of public theatres, everyone had a seat.
London’s private theatres were often used by companies of child actors, and the Whitefriars was no exception. Children of the King’s Revels occupied it from 1608 to 1609, succeeded by Children of the Queen’s Revels from 1609 to 1613. In the latter year the Queen’s Revels merged with an adult company, Lady Elizabeth’s Men, and in 1614 the combined troupe moved to the Hope Theatre. After this time the Whitefriars may have been used by Prince Charles’s Men. By 1629 the Whitefriars had been replaced by the Salisbury Court Theatre.
