Arthur Kopit, in full Arthur Lee Kopit,  (born May 10, 1937, New York, New York, U.S.—died April 2, 2021, New York, New York), American playwright best known for Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama’s Hung You in the Closet and I’m Feelin’ So Sad (1960). Subtitled “a pseudoclassical tragifarce in a bastard French tradition,” the play parodies the Theatre of the Absurd, the Oedipus complex, and the conventions of avant-garde drama.
Kopit attended Harvard University (A.B., 1959), where seven of his plays were produced while he was still a student. He later served as playwright in residence at Wesleyan University and adjunct professor of playwriting at Yale University and at City College, New York.
Praised for his ease with language, his impressive theatricality, and his skewering of American popular culture, Kopit wrote plays on a range of subjects. Among the works contained in The Day the Whores Came Out to Play Tennis and Other Plays (1965) are the one-act title play, about social climbers at a country club; Chamber Music, in which the residents of male and female wards of a mental institution fight each other; and Sing to Me Through Open Windows, in which a magician and his clown-butler live in self-isolation. Indians (1969) portrays some of the myths that have been used to justify political policies that led to the oppression of Native Americans. Kopit’s other plays include Wings (1978); the parodic The End of the World (1984), about the nuclear arms race; The Road to Nirvana (1991), a racy satire of Hollywood; and BecauseHeCan (2000), originally produced under the title Y2K. Kopit also wrote the book for the musicals Nine (1982), based on the Federico Fellini film 81/2 (1963), and Phantom (1992), a version of Phantom of the Opera.
