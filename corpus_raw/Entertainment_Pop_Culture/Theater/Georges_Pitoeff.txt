Georges Pitoëff,  (born Sept. 4, 1884?, Tiflis, Russia—died Sept. 17, 1939, Geneva), Russian-born director and producer, noted for his popularization in France of the works of contemporary foreign playwrights, especially Luigi Pirandello, George Bernard Shaw, Anton Chekhov, Arthur Schnitzler, and Eugene O’Neill. He was a member of the Cartel des Quatre (Group of Four), a group including Louis Jouvet, Charles Dullin, and Gaston Baty, dedicated to rejuvenating the French theatre.
Pitoëff formed his first professional theatrical company in 1915 in Geneva and took it on tour to Paris. After World War I he returned to Paris. There, Pitoëff and his company performed in various theatres, including that of actor-producer Jacques Copeau, from 1922 to 1934, when they were finally established at the Théâtre des Mathurins. Pitoëff’s work, which included the first successful French production of Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search of an Author and a notable revival of Shaw’s Saint Joan among his nearly 200 productions, demonstrated his skills at adapting, translating, designing, directing, and acting, although in the latter activity he was limited by his strong accent. He was eclectic in his choice of scripts but consistent in his direction, which sought to reveal with simplicity the essential ideas of each play. After his death, his wife, the actress Ludmilla Pitoëff, led the company.
