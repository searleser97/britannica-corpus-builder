Harlequinade,   play or scene, usually in pantomime, in which Harlequin, a male character, has the principal role. Derived from the Italian commedia dell’arte, harlequinades came into vogue in early 18th-century England, with a standard plot consisting of a pursuit of the lovers Harlequin and Columbine by the latter’s father, Pantaloon, and his bumpkin servant Pedrolino. In the Victorian era the harlequinade was reduced to a plotless epilogue to the main pantomime, which was often a dramatized fairy tale.
