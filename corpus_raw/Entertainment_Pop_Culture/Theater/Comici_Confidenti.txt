Comici Confidènti,  either of two companies of the Italian commedia dell’arte that were instrumental in extending the reputation of this form of improvised theatre throughout Europe. The first company, which performed in France and Spain as well as in Italy, was formed about 1574 under the leadership of the commedia actress Vittoria Piissimi and her actor husband, Giovanni Pellesini, who had created the mask of the character Pedrolino. Early in the 17th century, with the demise of the Gelosi, the leading commedia company, it became the favourite of the Mantuan court.
The second troupe, which traveled principally in Italy, was established about 1610 under the leadership of the producer-director Flaminio Scala and the patronage of Giovanni de’ Medici. After its dissolution (c. 1621) a number of its actors became associated with the French version of the commedia dell’arte, the Comédie-Italienne in Paris.
