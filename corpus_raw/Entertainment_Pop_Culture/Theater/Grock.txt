Grock, original name Charles Adrien Wettach,  (born Jan. 10, 1880, Reconvilier, Switz.—died July 14, 1959, Imperia, Italy), Swiss clown whose blunders with the piano and the violin became proverbial.
He was the son of a watchmaker and began his performance career by partnering with his father in a cabaret act. He then became an amateur acrobat and was allowed to spend each summer with a circus, where he performed first as a tumbler and then as a violinist, pianist, and xylophonist. He became the partner of a clown named Brick and changed his name to Grock in 1903. Together they appeared in France, North Africa, and South America. When Brick married, Grock joined the celebrated clown Antonet (Umberto Guillaume). At Berlin, appearing on a stage instead of in an arena, they failed at first; but, by mastering the stage technique, they obtained a London engagement in 1911. Two years later Grock perfected those adventures of a simpleton among musical instruments that made many a European audience laugh—for instance, at his wonder as to where the strings had gone when he held his fiddle the wrong side up. In 1924 he left England and remained on the European continent until his farewell performance at Hamburg in 1954. Grock wrote several books, among them his autobiography, Die Memoiren des Königs der Clowns (1956; Grock, King of Clowns).  His performances have been preserved on film (1927, 1931, 1949).
