Johann Friedrich Schönemann,  (born October 21, 1704, Crossen, Prussia [now in Germany]—died March 16, 1782, Schwerin, Mecklenburg [Germany]), actor-manager who was influential in the development of Germany’s public theatre.
Schönemann made his professional debut in 1725 with a traveling Harlequin troupe and in 1730 joined Caroline Neuber’s theatre company, where he was admired for his comedic abilities. In 1740 Schönemann (who had already broken with Neuber) and his wife, actress Anna Rachel Weigler, formed a company of their own, which toured at first but after 1751 played chiefly in Schwerin and Hamburg. Although Schönemann presented mostly French plays by such authors as Pierre Corneille, Voltaire, and Molière, his company gained great influence in German theatre with its staging and acting techniques. Schönemann himself never overcame the stiff acting style of traditional German drama, but his shrewd management attracted and encouraged the more natural acting techniques of such stars as Konrad Ekhof, Sophie Schröder, and Konrad Ackermann.
Later, Schönemann neglected the company for an unsuccessful career in horse trading, finally abandoning the theatre in 1757. He spent the last years of his life as an impoverished court retainer.
