Hanamichi,   (Japanese: “flower passage”), in Kabuki theatre, runway that passes from the rear of the theatre to stage right at the level of the spectators’ heads. Some plays also make use of a second, narrower hanamichi constructed on the opposite side of the theatre. The name hanamichi suggests that it was once used to present flowers and gifts to the actors.
An integral part of the Kabuki drama since the 18th century, it is used for climactic scenes—spectacular entries, exits, processions, and battles—and for scenes when intimacy and emotional rapport with the audience are desired. Geographically, it may represent a forest, a mountainous road, an inlet of water, or a street or ceremonial path to the inner courtyards of palaces. Like the main stage, it is often equipped with a trapdoor permitting the sudden appearance of ghosts or supernatural beings from below. The door is called suppon (Japanese: “snapping turtle”) because the actor’s head emerges like that of a turtle from its shell.
