Philip Astley,  (born Jan. 8, 1742, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, Eng.—died 1814, Paris, France), English trick rider and theatrical manager who in 1770 in London created Astley’s Amphitheatre, considered the first modern circus ring.
Astley was a horseman with a British dragoon regiment from about 1759 and at first was the sole performer in the Amphitheatre, specializing in riding with one foot on the saddle and one on the horse’s head while brandishing a sword. He gradually included other equestrians, acrobats, rope dancers, aerialists, clowns, and the first recorded circus freak show.
The Amphitheatre suffered destruction by fire several times, and eventually it became the Royal Amphitheatre of Arts under the patronage of the prince of Wales and the duke of York in 1794. From 1772 Astley made numerous tours of European cities, including Paris, where he performed before the French king and royal court. He established the Astley Amphitheatre in Paris (1782) and 18 other permanent circuses in cities throughout Europe.
