Maggie Cline, in full Margaret Cline,  (born Jan. 1, 1857, Haverhill, Mass., U.S.—died June 11, 1934, Fair Haven, N.J.),  American singer whose vigorous persona and hearty performances of Irish songs made her an immensely popular figure in the heydey of the vaudeville stage.
Cline, the daughter of Irish immigrant parents, went to work at age 12 in a local shoe factory. Five years later she determined to seek a career on the stage. Over the next several years she performed with vaudeville companies around the country. The golden era of vaudeville, roughly the 1890s and a few years on either side, was also a great era for Irish songs, and Cline was a great exponent of both. Tall, muscular, red-haired, “the daughter of Hercules and descendant of Stentor,” she sang such songs as “How McNulty Carved the Duck,” “Nothing’s Too Good for the Irish,” and “Slide, Kelly, Slide” as no one else could. Her rendition of Joseph Flynn’s “Down Went McGinty to the Bottom of the Sea,” a comic production enlisting the collaboration of stagehands, musicians, and audience alike, was a great hit. Cline’s greatest success was with “Throw Him Down, McCloskey,” written for her by John W. Kelly in 1890. It was the story of a pugilistic encounter, and her performance—perhaps rather “enactment”—of it regularly aroused the audience to rapture. She once estimated that she had sung that song some 75,000 times. Cline retired in 1917.
