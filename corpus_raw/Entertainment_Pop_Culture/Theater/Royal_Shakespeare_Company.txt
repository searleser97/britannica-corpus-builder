Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), formerly (1875–1961) Shakespeare Memorial Company,  English theatrical company based in Stratford-upon-Avon that has a long history of Shakespearean performance. Its repertoire continues to centre on works by William Shakespeare and other Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights. Modern works are also produced.
The company was founded in 1875 and was originally attached to Stratford’s Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (opened 1879; destroyed by fire 1926), which had been built through the efforts of Charles Edward Flower. This theatre was the site of an annual festival of Shakespeare’s plays, and its resident seasonal company was called the Shakespeare Memorial Company. In 1925 the company, which by then had become one of the most prestigious in Great Britain, was granted a royal charter. The new Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (opened 1932) was renamed the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in 1961, and the company too was renamed at that time.
Under the direction of Peter Hall, the RSC expanded its repertoire. It also established a second unit in London, first at the Aldwych Theatre and then, from 1982 to 2002, at the Barbican, which enabled its players to develop into a professional ensemble working year-round. Although it no longer has residence at a particular London theatre, the RSC regularly performs there. It also maintains a base (since 1977) in Newcastle and tours internationally.
Artistic directors subsequent to Hall were Trevor Nunn (1968–86), Terry Hands (1986–91; Nunn and Hands were joint artistic directors 1978–86), Adrian Noble (1991–2003), Michael Boyd (2003–12), and Gregory Doran (2013– ).
In the first decade of the 21st century, the company undertook a major renovation of its facilities in Stratford. The company’s two main theatres, the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and the Swan Theatre, were closed in 2007 to allow their expansion and refurbishment, which was completed in 2010. (During that time a temporary venue, the Courtyard Theatre, located on the site of the company’s The Other Place studio theatre, served as the RSC’s home.) Among the new facilities’ features were such enhancements as a tower (which afforded a view of the surrounding area), new dressing rooms, and several dining facilities. The main change for the theatregoer, however, was a new thrust-stage auditorium seating more than 1,000 that brought all the viewers much closer to the actors than they had been in the former building and encouraged a relationship between actor and audience much more similar to that of the Elizabethan era.
