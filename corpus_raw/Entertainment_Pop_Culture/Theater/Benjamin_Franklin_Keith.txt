Benjamin Franklin Keith,  (born Jan. 26, 1846, Hillsboro, N.H., U.S.â€”died March 26, 1914, Palm Beach, Fla.), American impresario who founded the most powerful circuit of theatres in vaudeville history.
Keith was a circus concessionaire before 1883, when he opened a curio museum in Boston. Two years later he joined Edward Franklin Albee, a seller of circus tickets, in establishing and operating the Boston Bijou Theatre, the home of a continuous variety show playing from 10:00 am until 11:00 pm. The pair then opened a great many theatres across the East and Midwest, absorbing most of the smaller chains.
