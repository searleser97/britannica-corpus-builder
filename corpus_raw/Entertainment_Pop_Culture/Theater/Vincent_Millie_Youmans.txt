Vincent Youmans,  (born Sept. 27, 1898, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  April 5, 1946, Denver, Colo.), American songwriter best known for writing the scores for the musicals No, No, Nanette (1925), Hit the Deck (1927), and the first Fred Astaire–Ginger Rogers vehicle, Flying Down to Rio (1933).
Youmans started writing songs while he was in the U.S. Navy during World War I. After the war he worked as a “song-plugger” (a singer hired by a music publisher to help popularize and sell sheet music) and with composer Victor Herbert as a rehearsal pianist. His songwriting gained popularity on Broadway. He worked with a number of lyricists, including Ira Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Edward Heyman.
Forced to retire in 1934 because of tuberculosis, Youmans recovered slowly and was unable to work steadily. An attempted comeback in 1944 failed, and Youmans’ health once again deteriorated.
Youmans’ songs were notable for their simplicity. Of his fewer than 100 published songs, some 18 are considered standards. These include “Tea for Two,” “I Want to be Happy,” “More Than You Know,” “Time on My Hands,” “Drums in My Heart,” “Flying Down to Rio,” “Carioca,” and “Orchids in the Moonlight.”
