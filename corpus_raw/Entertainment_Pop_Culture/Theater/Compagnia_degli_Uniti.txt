Compagnia degli Uniti, (Italian: “Company of the United”)  company of actors performing commedia dell’arte (improvised popular comedy) in Italy in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. This period is acknowledged as the golden age of the genre. The performers were noted for their skills, culture, wit, and sophistication. Leadership was provided by Drusiano Martinelli and his wife, Angelica.
Documents of the company’s activities exist from 1578 to 1640, including performances in Genoa, Padua, and the court at Mantua. One of the most noted actors to perform with the Uniti was Silvio Fiorillo, known for the innovations he made in the characters of the cowardly braggart Capitano Mattamoros and the eccentric curmudgeon Pulcinella.
