Sarugaku,   form of popular Japanese entertainment dating from at least the 11th century, which reached its high point by the 14th century. Originally, sarugaku involved mainly acrobatics, juggling, and mime. During the Heian period (794–1185) it was combined with drum dancing. Sarugaku helped give rise to the Nō and kyogen forms of drama.
