Gilbert R. Spaulding,  (born 1811, New York State, U.S.—died  1880), circus impresario, creator of the “Floating Palace,” an elaborate two-story steamboat that contained a regulation circus ring and a stage and toured the Mississippi and Ohio rivers during the 1850s. Spalding introduced the quarter poles (for supporting the tent roof), which enable circuses to use larger tents. He lit his tent with oil lamps instead of candles and was one of the first to move his circus by railroad.
