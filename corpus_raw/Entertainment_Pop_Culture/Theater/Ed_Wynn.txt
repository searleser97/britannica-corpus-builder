Ed Wynn, byname of Isaiah Edward Leopold,  (born Nov. 9, 1886, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  June 19, 1966, Los Angeles, Calif.), American comedian and actor in vaudeville, theatre, and motion pictures and on radio and television. He was also a producer, author, and songwriter.
Wynn made his professional debut with the Thurber-Nasher Repertoire Company in Norwich, Conn., in 1902 and acquired the nickname of the Perfect Fool from a revue of the same name in 1921—a production that he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in. He also toured and finally broadcast this revue (the first complete Broadway show to be done on radio). Many similarly successful shows followed. During the 1930s he starred in a nationwide radio show, and his voice became familiar to millions of listeners. His style of comedy on stage and in motion pictures, however, was highly visual, often involving the use of bizarre costumes and exaggerated, madcap mannerisms and sight gags. His early films included Rubber Heels (1927), Follow the Leader (1930), and The Chief (1933).
Wynn turned to dramatic acting in the 1950s, playing in Requiem for a Heavyweight (winner of television’s 1956 Emmy Award) and in the film The Diary of Anne Frank (1959), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. His later motion pictures included The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965) and Mary Poppins (1964). His son, Keenan Wynn (1916–86), became a well-known actor and his grandson, Tracy Keenan Wynn, a screenwriter.
