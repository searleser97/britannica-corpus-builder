Marilyn Miller, pseudonym of Mary Ellen Reynolds,  (born September 1, 1898, Evansville, Indiana, U.S.—died April 7, 1936, New York, New York), one of the most popular American musical comedy actresses of the 1920s.
Mary Ellen Reynolds grew up with her stepfather’s name, Miller. Her parents and eldest sister formed a vaudeville act called the Columbian Trio, which Marilyn joined as “Mlle Sugarplum” when she was four, making her stage debut in August 1903 in Dayton, Ohio. For 10 years she toured at home and abroad in the family act, which ultimately became the Five Columbians. Her dancing attracted the attention of manager-producer Lee Shubert, who discovered her at the Lotus Club in London and invited her to perform at the Winter Garden in New York City. She debuted there in The Passing Show of 1914, which was followed by appearances in later editions of The Passing Show.
In 1918 Miller came under the management of Florenz Ziegfeld, for whom she appeared in Fancy Free and the Ziegfeld Follies of 1918. In 1920 she starred in Sally, which ran for three years and in which she was a sensation, especially singing Jerome Kern’s “Look for the Silver Lining” and “Whip-poor-will.” Her appearance in Peter Pan in 1924 was her only nonmusical role. Miller became the reigning queen of musical comedy in a series of bright splashy productions, including Sunny (1925–26), Rosalie (1928), Smiles (1930–31), and As Thousands Cheer (1933–34).
Her youthful grace, small figure, dazzling smile, and blonde beauty made Miller seem the very embodiment of youth. She went to Hollywood in 1930 to make film versions of Sally and Sunny and also starred in Her Majesty, Love (1931). Miller died suddenly in 1936 of an acute sinus infection. A film biography of her, released in 1949, was aptly titled Look for the Silver Lining.
