The Threepenny Opera,  musical drama in three acts written by Bertolt Brecht in collaboration with composer Kurt Weill, produced in German as Die Dreigroschenoper in 1928 and published the following year. The play was adapted by Elisabeth Hauptmann from John Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera (1728).
Antihero gangster Macheath (“Mackie”) marries Polly Peachum, daughter of a leader of a ring of London beggars. Mr. Peachum contrives to have Macheath arrested; Macheath escapes but is betrayed to the police by a prostitute, Suky Tawdry. Condemned to the gallows, Macheath is saved by a last-minute pardon on Queen Victoria’s coronation day.
