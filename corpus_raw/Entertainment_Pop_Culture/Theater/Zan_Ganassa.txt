Zan Ganassa, pseudonym of Alberto Naselli, Naselli also spelled Naseli,  (born 1540?—died 1584?), one of the most important and influential actors and company managers of the early Italian commedia dell’arte.
Ganassa, who took his name from that of a character he invented, was perhaps the first to take a commedia company beyond the borders of Italy. Evidence exists of his appearances at Mantua (1568) and Ferrara (1570), and a performance by him and his company in Paris in 1571 was perhaps the first of an Italian troupe in that capital. The company appeared in France several times during the next three years, most notably in 1572, when they were invited by Charles IX to entertain at the wedding of his sister, Margaret of Valois, to Henry of Navarre.
By 1574 Ganassa and his troupe were performing in Madrid, beginning a decade’s work in Spain and making one of the first appearances there by a commedia troupe. The company eventually acted in at least four theatres in Madrid, as well as in theatres at Sevilla (Seville), Valladolid, Guadalajara, and Toledo. The influences of Ganassa and his company upon the nascent Spanish professional theatre were many: the business organization of the commedia troupe was adopted by the Spanish; the corrales (theatres) being constructed at this time were altered to accommodate the practice of the Italians; and the new secular drama, especially the plays of Lope de Vega, frequently reflected the characters and situations that were the stock of the foreigners.
