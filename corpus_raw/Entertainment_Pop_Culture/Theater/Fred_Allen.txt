Fred Allen, original name John Florence Sullivan,  (born May 31, 1894, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.—died  March 17, 1956, New York, N.Y.), American humorist whose laconic style, dry wit, and superb timing influenced a generation of radio and television performers.
While working as a stack boy in the Boston Public Library, the young Sullivan came across a book on juggling from which he picked up that craft. He began juggling on amateur entertainment circuits and took the stage name Fred St. James (later Fred James). He added ventriloquism to his act, performing in touring amateur shows, and then went on a vaudeville tour that took him in 1915 and 1916 to Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii. When he returned to the United States it was as a professional. He came back to vaudeville, where he turned increasingly to comedy, and adopted his final stage name, Fred Allen, to honour the American Revolution hero Ethan Allen—who, he noted, was no longer using the name. He married a fellow performer, Portland Hoffa (1906–90), and during the 1920s appeared in a number of revues, such as The Passing Show, the Little Show, and Three’s a Crowd.
Allen was an established entertainer when he entered radio in 1932. He was featured on a variety of programs by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) before the advent of his most remembered work, “Town Hall Tonight” (1934–39), which became “The Fred Allen Show” in 1939 and ran until 1949. Allen and Portland Hoffa took the principal roles, along with the residents of “Allen’s Alley,” a cast of characters including Falstaff Openshaw, Titus Moody, Mrs. Nussbaum, and Senator Claghorn. Allen wrote nearly all of each of the 273 episodes of the program. His movies included Love Thy Neighbor (1940), in which he continued his good-natured feud with radio star Jack Benny. His autobiographical book, Treadmill to Oblivion, appeared in 1954.
