Marcel Marceau, original name Marcel Mangel,  (born March 22, 1923, Strasbourg, France—died September 22, 2007, Cahors), preeminent 20th-century French mime whose silent portrayals were executed with eloquence, deceptive simplicity, and balletic grace. His most-celebrated characterization was Bip—a character half-Pierrot, half-Charlie Chaplin’s Little Tramp—first presented by Marceau in 1947.
He was born into a Jewish family, and during World War II he changed his surname to Marceau and became active in the Resistance. He later studied at the School of Dramatic Art of the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre in Paris and with pantomimist Étienne Decroux. After his first success—the role of Arlequin in Baptiste, a pantomime—he concentrated completely on pantomime and formed a mime troupe.
Worldwide acclaim came in the 1950s with his production of a “mimodrama” of Nikolay Gogol’s short story “The Overcoat” and with successful personal appearances. Thereafter he toured internationally, and in 1978 he founded a school of mimodrama in Paris. Marceau also acted in several movies, including Barbarella (1968) and Silent Movie (1976). In 2005 he retired from performing. The recipient of numerous honours, Marceau was made an officer of the Legion of Honour (1970).
