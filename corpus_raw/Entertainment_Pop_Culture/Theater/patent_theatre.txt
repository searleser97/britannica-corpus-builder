Patent theatre,   any of several London theatres that, through government licensing, held a monopoly on legitimate dramatic production there between 1660 and 1843. In reopening the theatres that had been closed by the Puritans, Charles II issued Letters Patent to Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant giving them exclusive right to form two acting companies. Killigrew established The King’s Servants at Drury Lane, where they stayed. Davenant established The Duke of York’s Servants at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, from which they moved to Dorset Garden, finally settling at Covent Garden in 1732.
The legality of the patents, though continually questioned, was confirmed by Parliament with the Licensing Act of 1737, affirming Drury Lane and Covent Garden as the only legitimate theatres in England. Parliament began authorizing “theatre royals” outside of London in 1768, however, and in 1788 a bill was passed permitting local magistrates to license theatres outside a 20-mile radius of London. In London, evasion of the law was common, with unlicensed theatres offering undefined “public entertainments” and pantomime. In 1766 a third London theatre patent was issued to Samuel Foote for operation of the Haymarket Theatre during the summer months, and in 1807 the Earl of Dartmouth, as lord chamberlain, loosely interpreted the Licensing Act and began licensing other theatres in London. The Theatre Regulation Act of 1843 finally abolished the exclusive rights of the patent theatres to present legitimate drama.
