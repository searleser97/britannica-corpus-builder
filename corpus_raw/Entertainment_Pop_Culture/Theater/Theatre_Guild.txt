Theatre Guild,   a theatrical society founded in New York City in 1918 for the production of high-quality, noncommercial American and foreign plays. The guild, founded by Lawrence Langner (1890–1962), departed from the usual theatre practice in that its board of directors shared the responsibility for choice of plays, management, and production. The first two seasons, which included plays by Jacinto Benavente, St. John Ervine, John Masefield, and August Strindberg, demonstrated the artistic soundness of the plan.
Following the world premiere of George Bernard Shaw’s Heartbreak House in 1920, the guild became Shaw’s American agent, producing 15 of his plays, including world premieres of Back to Methuselah and Saint Joan. Eugene O’Neill’s long association with the guild began with its production of Marco Millions in 1928. Other American authors whose works were produced by the guild included Sidney Howard, William Saroyan, Maxwell Anderson, and Robert Sherwood—all Pulitzer Prize winners.
Many distinguished actors appeared in Theatre Guild productions, including Helen Hayes in Caesar and Cleopatra and Alla Nazimova in Mourning Becomes Electra. Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt first acted as a team there in Ferenc Molnár’s Guardsman and went on to act together in many other notable guild productions, such as Arms and the Man and The Taming of the Shrew.
The Theatre Guild contributed significantly to American musical theatre by producing George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward’s Porgy and Bess and by bringing Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II together for such collaborations as Oklahoma!
The “Theatre Guild of the Air” (1945–63) had a distinguished record of radio and television play productions, and the guild’s subscription series enabled audiences in 23 cities from coast to coast to see its major attractions and those of other managers.
