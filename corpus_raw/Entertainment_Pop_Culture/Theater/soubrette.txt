Soubrette,   in theatre, comic female character usually in the role of a chambermaid. The soubrette role originated in French comedy, one of the earliest examples being Suzanne in Pierre-Augustin de Beaumarchais’ Le Mariage de Figaro (1784). Still earlier, Molière’s plays Tartuffe (1664) and Le Bourgeois gentilhomme (1670) contained versions of the character in the roles of Dorine and Nicole.
Most often of an independent nature, the soubrette demonstrated a nonconformist attitude coupled with a down-to-earth approach and native humour. Quick-witted and subtle, as in the character Lisette in Pierre Marivaux’s Le Jeu de l’amour et du hasard (1730; The Game of Love and Chance), the soubrette developed greater popularity and recognition in comic opera and the operetta. During this period in the 18th century she became fixed as a type. The most successful soubrettes coupled the personality traits of Molière’s characters with a certain ingenuous charm. An outstanding example of this combination may be seen in the character of Franziska in Gotthold Lessing’s Minna von Barnhelm (1767).
