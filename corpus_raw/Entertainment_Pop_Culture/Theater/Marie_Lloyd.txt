Marie Lloyd, original name Matilda Alice Victoria Wood,  (born Feb. 12, 1870, London—died Oct. 7, 1922, London), foremost English music-hall artiste of the late 19th century, who became well known in the London, or Cockney, low comedy then popular. She first appeared in 1885 at the Eagle Music Hall under the name Bella Delmare. Six weeks later she adopted her permanent stage name.
T.S. Eliot wrote that her deep popular appeal stemmed from her ability to capture and express the spirit of the English common people. In her songs and sketches she introduced to the public a series of studies in Cockney humour, sympathetic to the little man and often risqué. Her best acts included “Everything in the Garden’s Lovely,” “Oh, Mr. Porter,” and “One of the Ruins that Cromwell Knocked About a Bit.”
