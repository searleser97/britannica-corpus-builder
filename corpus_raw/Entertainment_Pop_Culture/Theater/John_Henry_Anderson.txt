John Henry Anderson,  (born July 14, 1814, Craigmyle, Aberdeen, Scot.—died  Feb. 5, 1874, Darlington, Durham, Eng.), Scottish conjurer and actor, the first magician to demonstrate and exploit the value of advertising.
Described on playbills as “Professor Anderson, the Wizard of the North,” he first performed in 1831. Seasons at Edinburgh (1837) and Glasgow (1838–39) followed. In London (1840) he made use of the most elaborate collection of magical apparatus ever seen there. During a U.S. tour (1851–53) Anderson first did his famous “gun trick,” by which he appeared to catch a bullet fired by someone in the audience. On his return to Great Britain he performed before Queen Victoria and then took the title role in the melodrama Rob Roy at the Lyceum and Covent Garden theatres (1855–56). The three-day “Grand Carnival” with which the Covent Garden seasons were concluded ended in disaster in 1857 when Anderson tried to dispel drunken revelers by lowering the gaslights. The ceiling caught fire, and the theatre was burned down. This only added to his fame, and he continued to tour widely, his style of presentation gradually becoming less flamboyant.
