Ringling Brothers, original surname Rüngeling,  family of American circus proprietors who created the Ringling Brothers circus empire in the late 19th century.
The members active in founding and running the family’s circus enterprises were all brothers: Albert C. (1852–1916), Otto (1858–1911), Alfred T. (1861–1919), Charles (1863–1926), John (1866–1936), and occasionally August G. (1854–1907) and Henry (1869–1918) Ringling.
The sons of August Rüngeling, a German-born harness maker, Charles, Albert, Otto, Alfred, and John in 1882 formed a song-and-dance troupe, the Classic and Comic Concert Co., and went on the road with it for two seasons. They began adding circus acts to their show, and they organized their first small circus, which opened on May 19, 1884, in their hometown of Baraboo, Wisconsin; from there they toured the U.S. Midwest. Their progress was slow until they acquired their first elephant in 1888, after which the circus expanded rapidly. Charles was the guiding managerial force behind the circus for many years. In 1890 the Ringling Brothers first began loading their circus wagons on railway cars, enabling them to make a much longer tour. By 1900 the Ringling Brothers were actively competing with the Barnum & Bailey Circus, and they subsequently started buying up other circuses. They acquired the Forepaugh-Sells Circus in 1906, and, after James A. Bailey’s death in 1906, they bought the Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1907, thus becoming the leading circus in the country, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows.
After Charles’s death in 1926, John ran the empire alone for 10 years. In 1929 he bought the American Circus Corporation, thus bringing a total of 11 major circuses under Ringling control. By this time the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus had a main-tent seating capacity of 10,000. John died in 1936, and the circus finally passed out of the Ringling family’s hands in 1967, when it was purchased by the Feld family.
The company also maintained the Ringling Museum of the Circus in Sarasota, Florida, and Circus World Museum in Baraboo, where many of the original circus wagons were restored and are exhibited.
In 2015 Feld Entertainment, the corporate parent of Ringling, announced that the circus would no longer feature elephant acts, a response to decades of complaints by animal rights advocates that the circus mistreated the animals. The resulting decline in ticket sales, however, led to Feld’s decision in 2017 to close the circus in May of that year.
