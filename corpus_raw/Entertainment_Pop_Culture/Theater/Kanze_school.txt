Kanze school, Japanese Kanze-ryū,  school of nō theatre (q.v.) known for its emphasis on beauty and elegance. The school was founded in the 14th century by Kan’ami (q.v.), who founded the Yūzaki-za (Yūzaki troupe), the precursor of the Kanze school. The second master, Zeami Motokiyo, completed the basic form of the art under the protection of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu.
Since the Muromachi period (1338–1573) the Kanze school has been the largest nō group in Japan—registering several hundred nō musicians and more than half the dues-paying nō enthusiasts of Japan.
