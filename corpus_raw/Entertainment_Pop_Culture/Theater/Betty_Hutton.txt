Betty Hutton, original name Elizabeth June Thornburg,  (born February 26, 1921, Battle Creek, Michigan, U.S.—died March 12, 2007, Palm Springs, California), American actress and singer who electrified audiences with her explosive personality and high-spirited performances in musicals and comedies on the stage and screen.
At the age of three Hutton began performing for audiences in her mother’s Detroit speakeasies during the Prohibition era. In 1937 she became the lead vocalist with the Vincent Lopez Orchestra, and in 1940 she found success on Broadway in Buddy DeSylva’s Two for the Show and Panama Hattie. Her film career took off when she was signed by Paramount Pictures and appeared in the films The Fleet’s In (1942) and The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek (1944). Her biggest success came with the MGM musical Annie Get Your Gun (1950), for which she replaced Judy Garland in the lead role. Other hit films included Red, Hot, and Blue (1949) and the Academy Award-winning The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). Hutton also hosted her own television program, The Betty Hutton Show (1959–60).
Plagued by a host of emotional problems, Hutton lived in relative obscurity during the 1970s. After a Roman Catholic priest helped to turn her life around, Hutton completed a master’s degree in psychology and taught during the 1980s. An unfinished autobiography was published posthumously as Backstage You Can Have: My Own Story (2009).
