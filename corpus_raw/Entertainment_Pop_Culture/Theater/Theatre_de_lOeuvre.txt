Théâtre de l’Oeuvre,  French Symbolist theatre founded in Paris in 1893 by Aurélien Lugné-Poë and directed by him until 1929. An actor and stage manager with André Antoine’s Théâtre Libre, Lugné-Poë was introduced to Symbolist theatre at Paul Fort’s Théâtre d’Art in the 1890s. When Fort retired from the theatre, Lugné-Poë assumed leadership in Symbolist production by opening what would become the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre with Maurice Maeterlinck’s Pelléas et Mélisande on May 17, 1892. Assisted by the poet and critic Camille Mauclair and the painter Édouard Vuillard, Lugné-Poë dedicated the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre to presenting the work of the young French Symbolist playwrights and introducing major foreign dramas. Besides those of Maeterlinck, he produced works by Oscar Wilde, Gerhart Hauptmann, August Strindberg, and Gabriele D’Annunzio and was instrumental in introducing Henrik Ibsen’s plays to France. Alfred Jarry’s nihilistic farce Ubu Roi premiered there in 1896.
Lugné-Poë sought to create a unified nonrealistic theatre of poetry and dreams through atmospheric staging and stylized acting. Scenery was reduced to simple, abstract backdrops; the stage was darkened or lighted from above; gestures were stylized and speeches were chanted; and costumes were usually simple and “timeless.” By 1899 the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre had presented 51 programs and toured England, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium. Lugné-Poë closed the Théâtre de l’Oeuvre in 1899 but revived it in 1912 and again for a time after World War I. He continued to produce the works of new French playwrights, such as Paul Claudel, and those of Dadaist and Surrealist writers.
