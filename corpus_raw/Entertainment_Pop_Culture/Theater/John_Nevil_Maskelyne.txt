John Nevil Maskelyne,  (born December 22, 1839, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England—died May 18, 1917, London), British magician whose inventions and patronage of new performers greatly influenced the development of the art of producing illusions by sleight of hand.
Trained as a watchmaker, Maskelyne became famous in 1865 when he, aided by George A. Cooke, exposed the Davenport Brothers as fraudulent spiritualists. For eight years he and Cooke performed a show featuring Maskelyne’s box trick, juggling, and automata. After Cooke died in 1904, Maskelyne took as a partner David Devant, the most famous magician in England. Maskelyne’s son Nevil collaborated with Devant on Our Magic (1911), an important source book on the theory of magic.
