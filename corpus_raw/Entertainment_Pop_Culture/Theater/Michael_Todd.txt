Michael Todd, byname Mike Todd,  original name Avrom Hirsch Goldbogen,  (born June 22, 1909, Minneapolis, Minn., U.S.—died  March 22, 1958, near Grants, N.M.), American showman with a flair for the flamboyant who is remembered as a film producer for Around the World in Eighty Days (1956).
Todd made his first mark as a showman with a dancing revue at the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago in 1933. He later wrote for the slapstick comedy team of Olsen and Johnson. Todd produced and cowrote many Broadway revues, beginning with Call Me Ziggy (1936). His later productions included Hot Mikado (1939), Gilbert and Sullivan set to jazz, productions for the 1939 World’s Fair in New York City, Something for the Boys (1943), Cole Porter’s Mexican Hayride (1944), and Up in Central Park (1945).
Todd promoted the development of the wide-screen film technique called Todd-AO, first used in the film version of Oklahoma! (1955). In October 1956 Around the World in Eighty Days in Todd-AO opened with a barrage of publicity generated by Todd. It won the Academy Award as best picture of the year.
Todd, who married his third wife, Elizabeth Taylor, in 1957, was killed in an airplane crash in 1958.
