Green theatre,  planting, usually of evergreens, designed to provide accommodation for outdoor theatrical entertainment.
Intimate theatres included in 17th-century Italian gardens were often elaborate architectural and sculptural complexes not necessarily intended for actual performances but in themselves providing an opportunity for ingenious display. Some green theatres were workable, however, providing a stage, on several levels, with the various entrances screened by trimmed hedges. The best examples are at the Imperial Hill (Poggio Imperiale) and the Villa Marlia in Tuscany (near Lucca), Italy, and at the nearby Villa Garzoni at Collodi.
