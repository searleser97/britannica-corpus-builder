Harold Prince, in full Harold Smith Prince, byname Hal Prince,  (born January 30, 1928, New York, New York, U.S.—died July 31, 2019, Reykjavík, Iceland), American theatrical producer and director who was recognized as one of the most creative and innovative figures on Broadway in the 20th century.
The son of a New York stockbroker, Prince majored in English at the University of Pennsylvania (B.A., 1948) and began his theatrical career as an apprentice and stage manager for the noted producer and director George Abbott. In 1953 he began producing musicals (initially in partnership with Robert E. Griffith) and was highly successful in his first outing, The Pajama Game (1954). Prince received his first Tony Award when the production was named best musical. Over the next decade he had a string of hits that included Damn Yankees (1955), Fiorello! (1959), A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962), and Fiddler on the Roof (1964), all of which garnered the Tony for best musical. During this time, he also produced the hugely popular West Side Story (1957).
In 1962, with A Family Affair, Prince began directing musicals. He won directorial Tony Awards for Cabaret (1966) and Company (1970), both of which were also named best musical; Follies (1971; directed with Michael Bennett); Candide (1974); Sweeney Todd (1979); Evita (1979); The Phantom of the Opera (1988), which became Broadway’s longest-running musical in 2006; and a revival of Show Boat (1994). He also directed Zorba (1968); A Little Night Music (1973), another winner of the Tony for best musical; Kiss of the Spider Woman (1993); Parade (1998); and LoveMusik (2007). The popularity of his productions was evident by the number of their revivals. In 2017 he helmed the revue Prince of Broadway. 
Prince also directed the film Something for Everyone (1970). In addition, a number of his stage musicals were adapted as TV movies and films, the latter of which included A Little Night Music (1977), which he also helmed. In 2006 Prince won a Tony Award for lifetime achievement. Contradictions: Notes on Twenty-Six Years in the Theatre (1974) and Sense of Occasion (2017) were memoirs.
