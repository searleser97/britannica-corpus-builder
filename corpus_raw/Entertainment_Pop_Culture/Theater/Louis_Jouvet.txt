Louis Jouvet,  (born Dec. 24, 1887, Crozon, Fr.—died Aug. 16, 1951, Paris), actor, director, designer, and technician, one of the most influential figures of the French theatre in the 20th century.
Beginning as a pharmacist at his parents’ wishes, he soon turned to his real interest, the theatre, and, after being refused admission several times to the Conservatoire in Paris because of his stuttering, made his Paris debut in 1910 in The Brothers Karamazov. He served in World War I and in 1924 became director of the Comédie des Champs-Élysées in Paris, where he remained until 1934, when he was appointed director of the Athénée, a position he retained until his death.
Jouvet introduced the playwright Jean Giraudoux and the designer Christian Bérard to the theatre, brought new insight to the interpretation of Molière’s plays, developed lighting techniques, created simplified but highly suggestive settings, and brought new importance to the interpretive power of the actor’s voice. His greatest successes as actor-producer-director were Dr. Knock (1923), School for Wives (1936), and La Folle de Chaillot (Eng. title, The Madwoman of Chaillot, 1945). He also acted in such motion pictures as La Kermesse héroique (Eng. title, Carnival in Flanders, 1935), Volpone (1940), and Retour à la vie (Eng. title, Life Dances On, 1949). He was a deeply respected and indefatigable theatre worker, a teacher, lecturer, writer, and an honoured citizen and cultural ambassador of his country when he and his company toured North and South America.
