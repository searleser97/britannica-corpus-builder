Earl of Leicester’s Men, also called Leicester’s Men,  earliest organized Elizabethan acting company. Formed in 1559 from members of the Earl of Leicester’s household, the troupe performed at court the following year. A favourite of Queen Elizabeth, the company was granted a license by royal patent. In 1576 James Burbage, a member of the troupe, built The Theatre to stage their productions. From 1570 to 1583 the Earl of Leicester’s Men enjoyed their greatest success, led by the premier actor William Kempe. In 1583, however, the company lost royal favour after the formation of Queen Elizabeth’s Men. With the death of the Earl of Leicester in 1588, the troupe merged with Lord Strange’s Men.
