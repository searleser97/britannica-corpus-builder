Tamāshā,   erotic form of Indian folk drama begun in the early 18th century in Mahārāshtra. In all other forms of Indian folk theatre, men are cast in the major roles. The leading female role in tamāshā, however, is played by a woman. Tamāshā plays, which are known to be bawdy, originated as entertainments for encamped armies. In the 20th century they became commercially successful.
