William Kempe,  Kempe also spelled Kemp,  (born c. 1560—died c. 1603), one of the most famous clowns of the Elizabethan era. Much of his reputation as a clown grew from his work as a member of the Chamberlain’s Men (c. 1594–99), of which he was part of the original company. Kempe was also renowned as a dancer of jigs.
The first record of Kempe as a performer is with the Earl of Leicester’s Men on a tour of the Low Countries and Denmark in 1585–86. As a solo performer, he followed in the tradition of Richard Tarlton and took on many of Tarlton’s famous roles after the great clown’s death in 1588. Kempe performed with Lord Strange’s Men in A Knack to Know a Knave, which he may have helped to write, in 1592. By this time Kempe’s reputation as a dancer was well established. He had enormous energy and stamina, and his improvised jigs (usually performed after a play) ranged from the wildly ridiculous to the overtly sexual.
With the Chamberlain’s Men, Kempe originated several of Shakespeare’s best known characters, including Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing and Peter in Romeo and Juliet. He was also believed to have played Bottom in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Lancelot Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice, and Falstaff. Kempe’s name, however, disappears from the lists of the company in 1599. The reason for his departure is not clear, though it has been speculated that his penchant for improvising (when Hamlet warns the players to “let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them,” the reference may be to Kempe) and his earthy jigs may not have appealed to the more refined audience the company was trying to cultivate.
After leaving the Chamberlain’s Men, Kempe remained in the public eye, gaining notoriety for performing a morris dance from London to Norwich (about 100 miles north) in February 1600. He again toured the continent in 1601 and then joined Worcester’s Men upon his return. It is thought that he died of the plague in London soon after.
