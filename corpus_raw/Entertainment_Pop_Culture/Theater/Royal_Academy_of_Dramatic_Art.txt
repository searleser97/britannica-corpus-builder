Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA),  state-subsidized school of acting in Bloomsbury, London. The oldest school of drama in England, it set the pattern for subsequent schools of acting.
It was established in 1904 by actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who soon moved it from Haymarket to its present location on Gower Street and set up a presiding council of other leading actors and producers. Principal of the academy from 1909 until 1955 was Sir Kenneth Barnes, who assured its success. A royal charter was granted in 1920, and from 1924 the Royal Academy received an annual government grant. The schoolâ€™s Vanbrugh Theatre (1954) replaced an earlier structure that was destroyed during World War II. In the late 1990s the theatre was razed, and a new, slightly larger building was erected in its place.
