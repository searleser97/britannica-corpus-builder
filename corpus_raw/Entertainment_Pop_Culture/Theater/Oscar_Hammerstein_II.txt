Oscar Hammerstein II,  (born July 12, 1895, New York, New York, U.S.—died  August 23, 1960, Doylestown, Pennsylvania), American lyricist, musical comedy author, and theatrical producer influential in the development of musical comedy and known especially for his immensely successful collaboration with the composer Richard Rodgers.
The grandson of the opera impresario Oscar Hammerstein, he studied law at Columbia University before beginning his career in the theatre. Between 1920 and 1959 he wrote all or part of about 45 musical dramas for stage, film, or television. Until he became exclusively Rodgers’ librettist in 1943, Hammerstein wrote lyrics for several other composers, among them Vincent Youmans, Rudolf Friml, Sigmund Romberg (“Lover Come Back to Me”; “Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise”), and Jerome Kern (“All the Things You Are”; “The Last Time I Saw Paris”). Among Hammerstein’s best known early works are Rose Marie (1924; music by Friml); The Desert Song (1925; music by Romberg); and the Jerome Kern musicals Sunny (1925) and Show Boat (1927), which includes the perennial favourites, “Ol’ Man River” and “Only Make Believe.”
After a period of less successful writing for films he teamed with Richard Rodgers in creating Oklahoma! (1943; winner of the Pulitzer Prize, 1944), Carousel (1945), and South Pacific (1949; Pulitzer Prize in 1950), combining bright tunes with relatively sophisticated stories—a blend then unfamiliar to the stage but later widely adopted. Hammerstein’s lyrics are often marked by a simplicity and sensitivity perhaps best exemplified by “If I Loved You” (from Carousel).
Rodgers and Hammerstein formed a music publishing firm, Williamson Music, Inc., and from 1949 were theatrical producers for their own works as well as for those of many others. Other musical comedies with Rodgers include The King and I (1951), The Sound of Music (1959), Flower Drum Song (1958), and the film State Fair (1945).
Hammerstein won Academy Awards for the songs “The Last Time I Saw Paris” from Lady Be Good (1941) and “It Might as Well Be Spring” from State Fair (1945). In addition, he received three Tony Awards for South Pacific and one for The King and I.
