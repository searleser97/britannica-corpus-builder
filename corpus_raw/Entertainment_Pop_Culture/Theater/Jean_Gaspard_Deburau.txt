Jean-Gaspard Deburau, in full Jean-baptiste-gaspard Deburau, Deburau  also spelled Debureau, original name Jan Kašpar Dvořák,  (born July 31, 1796, Kolín, Bohemia [now in Czech Republic]—died  June 17, 1846, Paris, France), Bohemian-born French pantomime actor, who transformed the character of Pierrot in the traditional harlequinade.
Born into a family of acrobats, Deburau from an early age performed with them on European tour and at age 15 joined the Théâtre des Funambules, a company of tightrope walkers, jugglers, and other circuslike performers in Paris. He performed with the Funambules for the rest of his life.
Gradually Deburau changed the robust simpleton of the commedia dell’arte figure Pierrot to the poignant character, dressed in baggy white costume, whose childlike manner, often as the optimistic but disappointed lover, charmed audiences and critics alike. The character influenced the Co-optimist concert party revue popular in Great Britain during the 1920s, as well as Marcel Marceau’s Bip. In his biographical play Deburau (1918), the French actor-dramatist Sacha Guitry dwelt on Deburau’s offstage relationship with Marie Duplessis, herself the model for Alexandre Dumas’s tragic heroine in The Lady of the Camellias (1848). After Deburau’s death his son Charles continued the Pierrot character at the Funambules.
