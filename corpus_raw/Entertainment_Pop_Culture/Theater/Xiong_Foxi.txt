Xiong Foxi, Wade-Giles romanization Hsiung Fo-hsi, original name Xiong Fuxi,  (born December 4, 1900, Fengcheng, Jiangxi province, China—died October 26, 1965, Shanghai), Chinese playwright who helped create popular drama intended to entertain and educate the peasantry.
Xiong Foxi began writing, directing, and acting in plays as a youth and, while at Yanjing University, helped establish the Minzhong Xijushe (People’s Dramatic Society). After graduate work at Columbia University in New York City, he returned to China in 1926 as a professor of dramatic arts and as the editor of a drama magazine. The high point of Xiong’s career came in 1932, when he was appointed director of an experimental rural theatre in Dingxian, Hebei province. His works from this period include Chutou jian’er (1932; “Young Man with a Hoe”), Tuhu (1933; “The Butcher”), and Guodu (1936; “River Crossing”; later rewritten and published as Houfang [1937; “Rearguard”]). His productions, which often used Western dramatic techniques and emphasized the importance of staging, won him wide renown; he described his experiences in the book Xiju dazhonghua zhi shiyan (1936; “Experiments in Popularizing Drama”).
During the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), Xiong served the Nationalist government as a theatre director, president of a dramatic arts college, and founder of two literary magazines. He also continued to write, producing two novels and numerous short stories. After the communist government was established in 1949, he was a leading member of many of its cultural and educational committees.
