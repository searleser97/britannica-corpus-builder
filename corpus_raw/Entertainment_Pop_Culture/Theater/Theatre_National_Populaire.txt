Théâtre National Populaire (TNP),  French national theatre created in 1920 to bring theatre to the general public. Its first director, Firmin Gémier, had been the director of the Théâtre Antoine and had made a number of attempts to create a people’s theatre. Initially the TNP offered productions from the other national companies in a large hall with inexpensive tickets. It had no acting company, could not produce its own plays, and was meagerly financed. Despite finding a permanent home at the Palais de Chaillot in 1937, the TNP was not really successful until some years after World War II.
Jean Vilar was made director in 1951 and was given enough financial support to establish a permanent company and produce at least 150 performances per year in and around Paris. Vilar formed an outstanding company, which included the popular film star Gérard Philipe. Vilar also divided his repertoire between French and foreign plays and established ticket prices competitive with the cinema. The troupe became enormously popular and in 1959 was given status equal to the Comédie-Français. Vilar resigned in 1963 and was replaced by Georges Wilson, a member of the acting company. In 1966 the TNP opened a Studio Theatre, the Salle Firmin Gémier, to stage experimental works. In 1972, as part of its attempt to decentralize French theatre, the government transferred the TNP’s title to Roger Planchon’s theatre in Villeurbanne, near Lyon.
