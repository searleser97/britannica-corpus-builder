Cai luong,   Vietnamese theatre style, the term meaning reformed or renewed theatre. It evolved during the French colonial period of Vietnam’s history (1862–1954) and clearly showed the influence of European drama. It transformed (though it did not supplant) the old established classical theatre (hat tuong) and somewhat resembled European comic opera in its blend of dialogue and song. Performed in European-style playhouses, the productions made much use of scenery, stage properties, and theatrical costumes.
