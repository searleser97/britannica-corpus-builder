Kola Ogunmola, original name Elijah Kolawole Ogunmola,  (born Nov. 11, 1925, Okemesi, Nigeria—died  1973), Nigerian actor, mime, director, and playwright who took Yoruba folk opera (drama that combines Christian themes with traditional Yoruban folklore, music and dancing, and music popular in urban culture) and developed it into a serious theatre form through his work with his Ogunmola Traveling Theatre (founded c. 1947). He was also widely regarded as one of the most brilliant actors in Africa in the 1950s and ’60s.
Ogunmola refined the techniques of his fellow Nigerian playwright Hubert Ogunde by eliminating the comic buffoonery typical of the latter’s work and by writing more tightly constructed plays, usually gentle social satires in which he laughs at, without passing judgment on, human folly and weakness. Ogunmola’s folk operas, like Ogunde’s, utilized biblical themes and Yoruba folklore, but Ogunmola developed these materials in a more overtly Christian and moralizing context. A typical play is Ife Owo (performed c. 1950 and widely played under its English title, Love of Money, published 1965), which depicts the sufferings of a polygamous husband who tries to satisfy the greed of his second wife. Ogunmola’s greatest fame, however, came from Omuti Apa Kini (performed 1963), a dramatic adaptation in the Yoruba language of Amos Tutuola’s well-known novel The Palmwine Drunkard. Although there were some claims that the adaptation lost much of the story’s original meaning, Omuti Apa Kini was immensely popular. Conscience was another moralistic social satire that showed refinement in its use of music and dancing.
Ogunmola suffered a stroke in 1970 and was hospitalized for a time. He returned to the stage in May 1972, but he never fully recovered and died a year later.
