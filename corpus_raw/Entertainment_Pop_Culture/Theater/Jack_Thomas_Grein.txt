Jack Thomas Grein, original name Jacob Thomas Grein,  (born Oct. 11, 1862, Amsterdam—died June 22, 1935, London), Dutch-born British critic, playwright, and theatre manager who influenced British drama at the turn of the 20th century.
Drawn to the theatre as a boy, Grein became a drama critic at 18. Family misfortunes forced him to go to London, where he worked for the Dutch East India Company and became a naturalized citizen in 1895. Inspired by André Antoine’s Naturalistic Théâtre-Libre, Paris, he founded (1891) the Independent Theatre, London, which was dedicated—despite critical opposition—to new plays chosen not for their commercial but for their literary and artistic value. Among the works produced by Grein were Henrik Ibsen’s Ghosts (1891) and George Bernard Shaw’s Widower’s Houses (1892). Grein wrote drama criticism for Life (1889–93), Illustrated London News, and other publications. His volumes of published criticism appeared from 1898 to 1903 and in 1921 and 1924. He did much to promote the transmission of new plays between England and the European continent.
