Chung Ling Soo, original name William Ellsworth Campbell,  (born 1861, New York, New York, U.S.—died March 23, 1918, London, England), American conjurer who gained fame in England by impersonating a Chinese magician, both on and off the stage.
He began performing in the United States using the stage name William E. (“Billy”) Robinson. While in England in 1900, he modeled himself after Ching Ling Foo, an authentic Chinese conjurer who had recently made a successful American tour. Accused by Ching in 1904 of being an imposter, Chung admitted to the masquerade, but his public admired him even more for his clever impersonation. Campbell was still playing Chung Ling Soo in 1918, when he was accidentally shot to death while doing a bullet-catching trick.
