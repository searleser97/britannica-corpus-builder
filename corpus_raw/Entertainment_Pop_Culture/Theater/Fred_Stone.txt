Fred Stone, in full Fred Andrew Stone,  (born Aug. 19, 1873, Valmont, near Denver, Colo., U.S.—died March 5, 1959, Hollywood, Calif.), popular American stage actor and dancer known for his versatility.
Stone was raised in Topeka, Kan., making his stage debut there at age 11, and soon joined his brother on tour with a number of small circuses. In the 1890s he teamed up with Dave Montgomery and together they toured in vaudeville and minstrel shows before appearing in their first Broadway show, The Girl from Up There (1901). The pair scored a major success in 1903 in The Wizard of Oz with Stone as the Scarecrow, and they went on to perform in other Broadway hits. After Montgomery’s death in 1917, Stone continued on his own as a top attraction, displaying his eccentric acrobatic dancing and engaging personality in such vehicles as Jack o’ Lantern (1917), Stepping Stones (1923), Criss Cross (1926), and Smiling Faces (1932). His last New York City appearance was as Granpa Vanderhof in the 1945 revival of You Can’t Take It with You.
Long active in attempts to unionize stage performers, early in his career Stone was blacklisted from vaudeville for his leadership role in the White Rats of America, a forerunner of Actors’ Equity Association, and he served for a time as president of National Vaudeville Artists. His wife, Allene Crater Stone, and his daughters, Carol, Dorothy, and Paula Stone, appeared in several stage and film productions with him. He published an autobiography, Rolling Stone, in 1945.
