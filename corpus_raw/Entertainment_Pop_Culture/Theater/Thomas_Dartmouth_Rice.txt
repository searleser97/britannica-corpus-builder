Thomas Dartmouth Rice, bynames Jim Crow Rice and Daddy Rice,  (born May 20, 1808, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Sept. 19, 1860, New York City), American actor regarded as the father of the minstrel show.
Rice was an itinerant actor until his song and dance Jump Jim Crow, first presented in Louisville in 1828, caught the public fancy and made him one of the most popular specialty performers of his day. Although he was not the first white entertainer to perform in blackface, Rice created a vogue for impersonating African Americans in both the United States and England through a series of extremely successful tours. He wrote and appeared in Ginger Blue, Jim Crow in London, and a burlesque of Othello. These engendered the stereotypes for the skits in the popular minstrel shows that evolved in the 1840s, primarily as a result of Rice’s success.
