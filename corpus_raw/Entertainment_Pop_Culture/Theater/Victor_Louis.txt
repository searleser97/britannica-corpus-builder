Victor Louis, original name Nicolas Louis,  (born May 10, 1731, Paris, Fr.—died  July 2, 1800, Paris), one of the most active of late 18th-century French Neoclassical architects, especially noted for theatre construction.
After at least seven unsuccessful attempts, Louis won the Prix de Rome in 1755. While in Rome (1756–59), he offended the director of the Academy there, Charles Joseph Natoire, and this social misstep resulted in his subsequent exclusion from the Academy of Architecture and from participation in royal building projects. However, after an unproductive sojourn in Poland (1765), he returned to France and began receiving commissions. The Intendance (governor’s residence) at Besançon (begun 1771) was his first important building, and this was followed by his masterpiece, the Grand-Théâtre in Bordeaux, the largest theatre in pre-Revolutionary France. With its impressive colonnade of 12 huge Corinthian columns and its elegant Neoclassical vestibule and symmetrical staircase lit by a glass dome, this building became the model for subsequent French theatre buildings and was the prototype for Charles Garnier’s Paris Opera House.
Louis’s next important commission was to enclose the garden of the Palais-Royal in Paris. He designed a large structure with a remarkably uniform facade of repeated pilasters and bays over a continuous ground-floor arcade. At one corner of the building he built a theatre, the Théâtre-Français, which became the home of the Comédie-Française. His final project, a grandiose public square in Bordeaux, was interrupted by the Revolution, which effectively ended his career.
