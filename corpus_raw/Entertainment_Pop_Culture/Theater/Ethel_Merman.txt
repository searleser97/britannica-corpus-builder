Ethel Merman, byname of Ethel Agnes Zimmermann,  (born January 16, 1909, Astoria, New York, U.S.—died February 15, 1984, New York, New York), American singer, actress, and lead performer in Broadway musicals who is remembered for her strong, clear voice.
Ethel Zimmermann worked as a secretary and sang in nightclubs and vaudeville before opening in George and Ira Gershwin’s musical Girl Crazy in 1930, billed as Ethel Merman. Though she lacked any formal musical training, she became an immediate sensation and launched a new hit song, “I’ve Got Rhythm.” Virtually everything she appeared in after that was a success, and she became a favoured performer for many of the major songwriters of the period—including Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin.
Merman’s triumphant Broadway debut was followed by an appearance in George White’s Scandals (1931), in which her rendition of “Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries” became another hit. She starred in both stage (1934) and screen (1936) versions of Porter’s Anything Goes. She gave several other memorable performances in such shows as Red, Hot and Blue! (1936), Du Barry Was a Lady (1939), Panama Hattie (1940), Something for the Boys (1943), and Annie Get Your Gun (1946), which was her biggest success. She appeared also in several films, including Kid Millions (1934), The Big Broadcast of 1936 (1935), Alexander’s Ragtime Band (1938), and Stage Door Canteen (1943).
After a two-year run in Call Me Madam, for which she won a Tony Award in 1951, Merman announced it would be her last Broadway show, but she returned to do Happy Hunting (1956) and enjoyed another huge success in Gypsy (1959). In 1970 she stepped into the title role of Hello, Dolly! Her later movies include There’s No Business Like Show Business (1954) and It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). The apparently ageless first lady of the American musical comedy stage, Merman was noted for her unflagging humour only slightly less than for her brassy and powerful vocal style. In 1955 she published an autobiography, Who Could Ask for Anything More?
During the 1950s and ’60s Merman made numerous appearances on television as well as in nightclubs, and into the 1970s she continued to be a popular television guest star. She received many awards for her performances over the years, including a 1972 special Tony Award in recognition of her lifetime contribution to show business. In 1978 she published Merman, a second autobiography.
