Stock character,  a character in a drama or fiction that represents a type and that is recognizable as belonging to a certain genre.
Most of the characters in the commedia dell’arte, such as Columbine and Harlequin, are stock characters. In Roman comedy there is the braggart soldier known as Miles Gloriosus; in Elizabethan drama there is usually a fool; and in melodrama there is a scheming villain. Although these characters are common types, they are not always treated or presented in a stock manner. A skillful author can develop them into more complex individuals. For example, in William Shakespeare’s Sir John Falstaff is an outsized, enduring version of the braggart soldier.
