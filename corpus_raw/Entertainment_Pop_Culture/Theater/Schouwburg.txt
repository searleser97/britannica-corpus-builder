Schouwburg,  first permanent theatre in Amsterdam, built along the Keizergracht (“Emperor’s Canal”) in 1637 by Dutch architect Jacob van Campen. It opened on Jan. 3, 1638, with a production of Gysbrecht van Aemstel, a historical tragedy about Amsterdam by Joost van den Vondel; the play is still performed annually in the Netherlands. The stage, raised about seven feet above the floor, had no proscenium arch or front curtain. A permanent, two-level stage facade consisted of pillars between which were set painted flat panels to indicate different settings. Two balcony stages were positioned over the side pillars. The elliptical auditorium was provided with two tiers of boxes and an upper gallery with a sloped floor and rows of benches. The flat timber roof supported a barrel vault.
In 1664–65 the old theatre was demolished and a new one built by Jan Vos in the Italian Baroque style with a proscenium and an elaborate system of wings, traps, flies, and machines. It was closed by the Puritans between 1747 and 1749 and was completely destroyed by fire in 1772. A new Schouwburg was built by V.E. Witte at a location near the city walls on the Leidseplein in 1774. It was in use until 1890, when it, too, burned to the ground.
