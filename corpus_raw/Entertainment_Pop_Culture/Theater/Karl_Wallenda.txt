Karl Wallenda,  (born 1905, Magdeburg, Germanyâ€”died March 22, 1978, San Juan, Puerto Rico), founder of the Great Wallendas, a circus acrobatic troupe famed for their three-man-high pyramid on the high wire.
The troupe first achieved fame in Europe for doing a four-man pyramid and cycling on the high wire. In 1928 they joined the U.S. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Combined Shows, where they developed a seven-man pyramid (1947). The Wallendas later performed as free-lancers. When the pyramid collapsed during a 1962 performance, two members of the troupe were killed and a third was paralyzed. Another was killed in a 1963 accident and still another in 1972. Karl died in a fall from a wind-whipped wire stretched 123 feet (37 metres) above the pavement, between two hotels in San Juan.
