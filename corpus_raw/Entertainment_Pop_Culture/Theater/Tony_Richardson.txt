Tony Richardson, original name Cecil Antonio Richardson,  (born June 5, 1928, Shipley, Yorkshire, England—died November 14, 1991, Los Angeles, California, U.S.),   English theatrical and motion-picture director whose experimental productions stimulated a renewal of creative vitality on the British stage during the 1950s. He was also known for his film adaptations of literary and dramatic works.
In 1953, after graduating from the University of Oxford, where he had been an active member of the dramatic society, Richardson became a director for the British Broadcasting Corporation. Two years later he joined the British Stage Company as associate artistic director, and he was a full director within a year. His reputation was established with his Royal Court Theatre production of John Osborne’s Look Back in Anger (1956), the play that became the representative work of Britain’s post-World War II generation of “Angry Young Men.” Under Richardson’s leadership the Theatre became a centre of creative activity that not only involved a reinterpretation of the classics but also included the presentation of the experimental plays of Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, and other playwrights of the Theatre of the Absurd. His Broadway productions of Osborne’s The Entertainer (1958) and Shelagh Delaney’s A Taste of Honey (1960) won popular and critical acclaim. Richardson also directed plays such as Pericles (1958) and a production of Othello (1959) starring the American singer and actor Paul Robeson at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.
Richardson’s first film, Momma Don’t Allow, was a short subject. In 1958 he formed Woodfall Film Productions, Ltd., with playwright Osborne. His films dealing with the British urban working class included the screen adaptations of his stage successes Look Back in Anger (1959), The Entertainer (1960), and A Taste of Honey (1961), as well as The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (1962), based on the novel by Alan Sillitoe. Richardson also produced Sillitoe’s novel Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960), directed by Karel Reisz. One of his greatest successes came when he directed Osborne’s adaptation of Henry Fielding’s novel Tom Jones (1963), a rousing evocation of the crudeness and vigour of 18th-century English life. The film won four Academy Awards, including those for best picture and best director.
Among the films he later directed were The Loved One (1965), based on a novel by Evelyn Waugh, and the antiwar movie The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968), which featured Vanessa Redgrave, Richardson’s wife from 1962 to 1967. His other credits included the Australian western Ned Kelly (1970), starring Mick Jagger; A Delicate Balance (1972), an adaptation of Edward Albee’s play; and Joseph Andrews (1977), based on another Fielding novel. He also directed The Hotel New Hampshire (1984), from a novel by John Irving. Richardson’s final film, the drama Blue Sky (1994), for which Jessica Lange earned an Oscar, was released three years after his death from complications of AIDS.
