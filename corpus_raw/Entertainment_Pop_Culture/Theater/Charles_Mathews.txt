Charles Mathews,  (born June 28, 1776, London, Eng.—died  June 28, 1835, Plymouth, Devon), prominent English stage personality and theatre manager who, renowned for his genius at mimicry and for his wit, was among the leading comedians of his day.
The son of a bookseller, Mathews was educated at Merchant Taylors School, Crosby, Lancashire. After acting in the provinces, primarily at York, he first appeared on the stage in Dublin in 1794 and made his London debut in 1803 in the role of Lingo in The Agreeable Surprize, by the English dramatist Samuel Foote. From that time, Mathews’ career was an uninterrupted triumph. He is credited with having created some 400 new parts, appearing at London’s finest theatres. Among his most notable roles was Sir Fretful Plagiary in Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s Critic. His first wife, Eliza Kirkham Strong, died in 1802, and he married the actress Anne Jackson, who later wrote the popular and diverting Memoirs of Charles Mathews (4 vol., 1838–39).
In 1808 Mathews conceived a personal form of entertainment known as “At Homes,” involving one-man shows with comic songs and impersonations of eccentric characters. It was in such performances that he revealed his great art of mimicry. In 1817 the English dramatist George Colman (the Younger) wrote The Actor of All Work for Mathews, enabling him to play a fantastically varied group of characters. Among the sketches he devised for himself are “Mr. Mathews and His Youthful Days” and “The Trip to America.” He toured the United States in 1822 and 1834. Already in poor health, he died shortly after his return to England. From 1827 he had co-managed the Adelphi Theatre, London, with a fellow actor, Frederick Henry Yates.
