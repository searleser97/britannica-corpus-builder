Red Skelton, byname of Richard Bernard Skelton,  (born July 18, 1913, Vincennes, Indiana, U.S.—died September 17, 1997, Rancho Mirage, California), American pantomimist and radio and television comedian, host, and star performer of the popular TV variety program The Red Skelton Show (1951–71; called The Red Skelton Hour from 1962 to 1970). In that series, Skelton re-created a number of characters—among them Clem Kaddiddlehopper, Sheriff Deadeye, Junior, the Mean Widdle Kid, and Cauliflower McPugg—he had developed during his years in vaudeville and radio. Skelton’s style deftly combined broad humour with emotional complexity.
Skelton’s father, a circus clown, died two months before Skelton was born, and he had to help support himself from an early age. He was a newsboy by age 7, and at 10 he took to the road with a medicine show touring the Midwest, effectively ending his classroom schooling. He went on to perform in minstrel shows, burlesque shows, circuses, and radio. His radio appearance on The Rudy Vallee Show in 1937 led to other bookings, and he was voted the outstanding new radio star of 1941. He also took roles in some 30 movies, including a film starring Ginger Rogers, Having a Wonderful Time (1938). His other movie credits included Bathing Beauty (1944), The Fuller Brush Man (1948), and Excuse My Dust (1951).
He moved from movies and radio to television when NBC inaugurated The Red Skelton Show in 1951. The show was canceled in 1953, but it was quickly picked up by CBS, where it remained until 1970; the final season was broadcast again by NBC. Skelton was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1988.
