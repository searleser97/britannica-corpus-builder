Blondin, pseudonym of Jean-François Gravelet,  (born February 28, 1824, Hesdin, France—died  February 22, 1897, Little Ealing, near London, England), French tightrope walker and acrobat who owed his celebrity and fortune to his feat of crossing the gorge below Niagara Falls on a tightrope 1,100 feet (335 metres) long, 160 feet (49 metres) above the water.
When he was five years old, he was sent to the École de Gymnase at Lyon, and, after six months’ training as an acrobat, he made his first public appearance, billed as “the Little Wonder.” He crossed the gorge below Niagara Falls a number of times, first in 1859, often employing theatrical variations, including walking while blindfolded, in a sack, trundling a wheelbarrow, on stilts, and carrying a man on his back, as well as sitting down midway to cook an omelette. In 1861 he appeared in London at the Crystal Palace, turning somersaults on stilts on a rope stretched across the central transept, 170 feet (52 metres) above the floor. His final performance was given at Belfast, Ireland (now in Northern Ireland), in 1896.
