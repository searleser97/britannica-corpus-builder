Hans Sachs,  (born November 5, 1494, Nürnberg, Germany—died  January 19, 1576, Nürnberg), German burgher, meistersinger, and poet who was outstanding for his popularity, output, and aesthetic and religious influence. He is idealized in Richard Wagner’s opera Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.
Wagner’s opera is partly a tribute to the common people—and Sachs was one of them. The son of a tailor, he was apprenticed to a shoemaker in 1509 after studying at a Latin school. He became a master cobbler in about 1519. Many guild workmen and tradesmen of that day practiced a type of singing based on elaborate rules; to become meistersingers (“master singers”), they had to prove themselves in a contest. Sachs became a master in the Nürnberg Singschule in about 1520, conducted a school of meistersingers at Munich, and headed the Nürnberg group in 1554.
Some of Sachs’s 4,000 meisterlieder (“master songs”), which he began writing in 1514, are religious. An early champion of Martin Luther’s cause, he wrote a verse allegory, Die Wittembergisch Nachtigall (1523; “The Nightingale of Wittenberg”) that immediately became famous and advanced the Reformation in Nürnberg. His 2,000 other poetic works include 200 verse dramas, 85 of which are Fastnachtsspiele, or homely comedies written to entertain Shrovetide carnival crowds.
Sachs remained a cobbler while pursuing the arts. Grief came to him with the loss of his seven children and, in 1560, of his wife. After marrying again in 1561, when he was 66, he resumed his output of cheerful composition. Virtually forgotten after his death, Sachs was rediscovered two centuries later by J.W. von Goethe. Some of Sachs’s plays, such as Der farent Schüler im Paradeis (1550; The Wandering Scholar), are performed today, and renewed interest in Renaissance music has resulted in a revival of his songs.
