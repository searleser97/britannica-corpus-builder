Charles Kemble,  (born Nov. 25, 1775, Brecknock, Brecknockshire, Wales—died Nov. 12, 1854, London), theatrical manager, the first to use appropriately detailed historical sets and costumes on the English stage, and an actor noted for his supporting roles in several Shakespeare plays, but at his best in comedy.
Kemble, the youngest member of a theatrical family, made his first recorded appearance in 1792 or 1793 at Sheffield as Orlando in Shakespeare’s As You Like It. His London debut took place on April 21, 1794: in Shakespeare’s Macbeth he acted Malcolm to the Macbeth of his brother, the tragedian and theatrical manager John Philip Kemble. In comedy he was frequently supported by his wife, Maria Theresa de Camp. He became manager of Covent Garden Theatre, London, but nearly went bankrupt until his daughter, Fanny Kemble, made her debut there in 1829 and became a success. Visits to the United States with his daughter in 1832 and 1834 also brought acclaim. Because of increasing deafness, he retired from the stage in December 1836 but gave readings of Shakespeare until 1840. After his retirement he was given the post of examiner of plays, a government position from which he resigned in 1840 to be succeeded by his son John Mitchell, a distinguished philologist.
