Ludi scaenici,   (Latin: “stage games”), in ancient Rome, theatrical performances associated with the celebration of public games (ludi publici), in which Greek dramatic forms were first used by the Romans. Although originally performed at the Ludi Romani (for which Livius Andronicus wrote the first Latin tragedy and the first Latin comedy in 240 bc), the ludi scaenici became the characteristic feature of the Megalensia, or Megalesia, the festival of the goddess Cybele (established in 204 bc). They originally included serious dramas but later, under the Roman Empire, were almost wholly devoted to farces and pantomime. The Ludi Saeculares (Secular Games) were celebrated only once in a century.
