John Rich,  (born c. 1682—died  Nov. 26, 1761, London, Eng.), English theatre manager and actor, the popularizer of English pantomime and founder of Covent Garden Theatre.
Rich was a manager by inheritance; he received a three-quarter share in Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theatre from his father, Christopher Rich, in 1714, and, after running that house successfully for 18 years, he founded Covent Garden Theatre in 1732. At both theatres he staged entertainments of a new type based on Italian foundations known as pantomime. In these he combined a classical fable with a grotesque story in commedia dell’arte style involving Harlequin and his beloved Columbine. From 1717 until the year before his death, he played Harlequin under his stage name of Lun and thus helped develop the harlequinade of English pantomime tradition. After Rich’s death, David Garrick paid tribute to the matchless expressiveness of his miming.
In 1727 Rich produced John Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera, which ran for a record number of 62 performances and, as was said at the time, “made Gay rich and Rich gay.”
