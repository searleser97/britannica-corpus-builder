WPA Federal Theatre Project,  national theatre project sponsored and funded by the U.S. government as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Founded in 1935, it was the first federally supported theatre in the United States. Its purpose was to create jobs for unemployed theatrical people during the Great Depression, and its director was the educator and playwright Hallie Flanagan.
The Federal Theatre Project employed some 10,000 professionals in all facets of the theatre, and Flanagan oversaw the organization of about 1,000 productions that were mounted in four years in 40 states, often presented free to the public. These productions included classical and modern drama, children’s plays, puppet shows, musical comedies, and documentary theatre known as Living Newspaper. Other projects included producing plays by young, unknown American playwrights, establishing black American theatre, and presenting radio broadcasts of dramatic works. The early careers of Orson Welles, John Houseman, and Elmer Rice were all associated with the Federal Theatre Project. Following a series of controversial investigations by the House Committee on Un-American Activities and Subcommittee on Appropriations regarding the Federal Theatre’s outspoken leftist commentary on social and economic issues, the Federal Theatre Project was terminated in 1939 by congressional action.
