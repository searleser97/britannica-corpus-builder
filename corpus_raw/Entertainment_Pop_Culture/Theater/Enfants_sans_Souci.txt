Enfants sans Souci,   (French: Carefree Children), one of the largest of the sociétés joyeuses of medieval France, an association of the merchants, craftsmen, and students of Paris, founded for the purpose of staging theatrical entertainments and other amusements. Such societies are thought to be descended from the earlier Feast of Fools (q.v.), a holiday of the lower clergy that was suppressed in the late Middle Ages.
The members of Enfants sans Souci, who performed in the traditional jester’s costume of cap and bells and called themselves sots (“fools”), marched in comic processions through the streets on holidays and performed satirical farces and morality plays in the public squares. A number of their leaders, who bore the title of “Prince of Fools,” or “Mother Fool,” were talented and popular performers, who both wrote and acted in farces. The organization, along with most of the other societies and confraternities that engaged in theatrical activities, gradually died out by the early part of the 17th century.
