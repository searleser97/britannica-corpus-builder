Edward Harrigan, byname Ned Harrigan,  (born October 26, 1845?, New York City, New York, U.S.—died June 6, 1911, New York City), American actor, producer, and playwright, half of the comedy team of Harrigan and Hart.
Harrigan—whose year of birth has been identified variously as 1843, 1844, and 1845—began his theatrical career in San Francisco, where in 1861 he was singing with Lotta Crabtree. After developing his skill as a comedian, Harrigan formed a team with Sam Rickey and returned to New York City. In 1872 he formed a new partnership with Tony Hart (original name Anthony Cannon; 1857–91), and Harrigan and Hart remained together until 1885. In 1876 they became comanagers of the Theatre Comique in New York City. After a new theatre was destroyed by fire in 1884, Harrigan became sole manager of Harrigan’s Park Theatre. During his long career he wrote several hundred sketches and plays, mostly burlesques.
