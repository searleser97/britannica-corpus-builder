Steve Martin,  (born August 14, 1945, Waco, Texas, U.S.), American comedian, writer, and producer who began his career as a stand-up comic and eventually achieved success in motion pictures, on television, on Broadway, and in literature.
Martin attended Long Beach State College in California. His interest in performing was honed during this period as he worked as a musician and magician at Disneyland and debuted his comedy-and-banjo-playing act in local nightclubs. He soon transferred to the University of California at Los Angeles, where he majored in theatre. In 1967, while still a student, he accepted a contract to write for the hit television show The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, for which he won an Emmy Award in 1969. Within a few years, he was writing for The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour and other top variety shows of the era.
Martin acquired a modest but loyal following during the early 1970s as he performed his stand-up routine on numerous television shows, particularly The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. His breakthrough came in 1976 when he hosted an episode of NBC’s Saturday Night Live, the first of more than 25 appearances on the show throughout the years. Within months, Martin was the top comic in the United States and was drawing standing-room-only crowds to some of the country’s largest performing venues. His exclamations “Well, excuuuuse me!” and “I am a wild and crazy guy!” became national catchphrases. It was also during this period that Martin had success as a recording artist: his Let’s Get Small (1977) and A Wild and Crazy Guy (1978) comedy albums earned Grammy Awards, and his hit single “King Tut” (1978) sold more than a million copies.
Martin wrote and starred in his debut film, the Academy Award-nominated short subject The Absent-Minded Waiter, in 1977. This led to an extended collaboration with writer-director-actor Carl Reiner on the hit comedies The Jerk (1979), Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (1982), The Man with Two Brains (1983), and All of Me (1984). These films established Martin as a movie star of the first rank, and he subsequently retired from stand-up comedy. He demonstrated his willingness to take chances with critically praised limited-audience fare such as Pennies from Heaven (1981), The Lonely Guy (1984), L.A. Story (1991), and Leap of Faith (1992), and he maintained his popular appeal in such films as Little Shop of Horrors (1986), Roxanne (1987), Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), Parenthood (1989), Father of the Bride (1991), and Father of the Bride, Part II (1995).
At the beginning of the 21st century, his box-office success continued with Bringing Down the House (2003) and Cheaper by the Dozen (2003) and its sequel (2005). He later portrayed Inspector Jacques Clouseau, a character made famous by Peter Sellers, in The Pink Panther (2006) and The Pink Panther 2 (2009). Martin’s other films included It’s Complicated (2009), The Big Year (2011), Home (2015), and Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk (2016). Martin teamed with comedian Martin Short (a longtime friend and occasional collaborator) and Selena Gomez as an unlikely crime-solving trio in the TV series Only Murders in the Building (2021– ), which Martin also cocreated.
Martin’s noteworthy writing endeavours included the plays Picasso at the Lapin Agile, which premiered at Chicago’s Steppenwolf Theatre in 1993 before moving to other cities, and Meteor Shower, a comedy that ran on Broadway in 2017–18 and starred Amy Schumer. He also wrote a series of well-received satiric articles for The New Yorker magazine, later published in the best-selling collection Pure Drivel (1998). His novella Shopgirl (2000) was produced as a film in 2005 with Martin in a starring role, and his follow-up, The Pleasure of My Company (2003), topped best-seller lists. His autobiography, Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life, was published in 2007, and he received a Kennedy Center Honor later that year. In private life, Martin was an art connoisseur, and he explored the New York art world in the novel An Object of Beauty (2010).
In 2009 Martin released The Crow, a collection of original banjo compositions that featured guest performances by banjo virtuoso Béla Fleck and country legends Earl Scruggs and Dolly Parton. A radical departure from the novelty and kitsch of “King Tut,” The Crow was critically lauded and ultimately won the Grammy Award for bluegrass album of the year. Martin continued in that stylistic vein with Rare Bird Alert (2011), on which he performed with the bluegrass band the Steep Canyon Rangers, and Love Has Come for You (2013), a Grammy-winning collaboration with singer-songwriter Edie Brickell. The latter album inspired the musical Bright Star, which premiered in 2014 and made its Broadway debut two years later. The duo cowrote the score, and Martin penned the book for the sentimental play about two connected love stories in North Carolina during the 1920s and ’40s. It received five Tony Award nominations, including best musical, score, and book.
In 2016 Martin, Short, and the Steep Canyon Rangers launched a comedy and bluegrass tour, and one of the shows was televised as the 2018 comedy special Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life. During this time Martin also collaborated with the Steep Canyon Rangers on The Long-Awaited Album (2017).
In addition, Martin hosted the Academy Awards ceremony in 2001 and 2003 and cohosted the event with Alec Baldwin in 2010. Martin received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2005 and was given an honorary Oscar in 2013.
