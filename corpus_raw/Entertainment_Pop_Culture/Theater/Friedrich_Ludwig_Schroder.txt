Friedrich Ludwig Schröder,  (born November 3, 1744, Schwerin, Mecklenburg [now in Germany]—died September 3, 1816, Rellingen), German actor, theatrical manager, and playwright who introduced the plays of William Shakespeare to the German stage.
Schröder’s parents were legendary figures of the German stage: his stepfather, Konrad Ernst Ackermann, was a brilliant and much-beloved comic actor, and his mother was the renowned actress Sophie Schröder. Friedrich’s true inspiration, however, came from Konrad Ekhof, who had joined Ackermann’s company in 1764.
In 1771 Schröder became the manager of the Hamburg National Theatre, where he remained for nine years and established himself as the leading German actor of the time. Highlights of his first Hamburg period were his Shakespearean productions, in which he played Hamlet, the ghost of Hamlet’s father, Iago, Shylock, Lear, Falstaff, and Macbeth. He also presented to Hamburg audiences the early dramas of J.W. von Goethe—Götz von Berlichingen, Clavigo, and Stella—and the plays of such other Shakespeare-inspired Sturm und Drang dramatists as Friedrich Maximilian von Klinger and Heinrich Leopold Wagner. From England he imported Edward Moore’s Gamester and George Lillo’s London Merchant.
Schröder left Hamburg in 1780 and spent four years at the Vienna Burgtheater, where he established the ensemble acting for which that company later became known. From 1785 to 1798 he was again director of the Hamburg National Theatre, where he produced many of the plays he had written in Vienna.
