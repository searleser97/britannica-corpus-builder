Repertory theatre,  system of play production in which a resident acting company keeps a repertory of plays that are always ready for performance, often presenting a different one each night of the week, supplemented by the preparation and rehearsal of new plays.
Repertory in its true form has existed in state-supported theatres in France, Germany, and elsewhere; but, as it is rather expensive and difficult to maintain, most modern repertory companies use a modification of the system, usually presenting fewer and longer-running plays, alternately or successively, in one season. Repertory theatre has proved effective in supporting both commercially successful and experimental drama. It has served as a showcase for the early work of playwrights such as Eugene O’Neill and John Millington Synge and as a training ground for young actors. It is a popular format for summer festivals as well as national theatres.
In Great Britain the name repertory theatre came to designate an important movement, begun in the early 1900s, to make quality theatre available throughout the country. Repertory companies were established in such cities as Manchester, Birmingham, and Liverpool, producing new plays every week or two (called “weekly rep”). Although they maintained permanent companies, these were not at first true repertory theatres because they presented a series of short, continuous runs rather than keeping a ready repertory of plays. They began receiving government aid in 1946 and by the 1960s had developed “true rep” much like the state-supported theatre of other European countries. Major English companies using the repertory system include the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon and London and the National Theatre Company. Attempts to establish repertory theatres in the United States have met with less success. (See also stock company.)
