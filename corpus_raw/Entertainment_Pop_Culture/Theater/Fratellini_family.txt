Fratellini Family,  European circus family best known for the Fratellini Brothers, a clown trio—Paul, François, and Albert (respectively, b. 1877—d. 1940; b. 1879—d. 1951; b. 1886—d. 1961)—whose wit, charm, and superb acting techniques were widely admired and brought about a resurgence of interest in the circus in post-World War I Paris.
Their father, Gustavo Fratellini (1842–1905), a Florentine follower of the Italian patriot Giuseppi Garibaldi, was a circus trapeze artist and acrobat, and their elder brother, Louis (1867–1909), worked as a clown with Paul. François and Albert also began their careers as a pair. When Louis died in 1909 he left a family without support and Paul without a partner. To solve both problems the remaining brothers formed a unique triple act: François retained his traditional role as the elegant, pompous, white-faced clown; Albert, as the hapless, ragged Auguste, designed grotesque new makeup with high black brows, an exaggerated mouth, and a bulbous red nose (a makeup style that influenced countless subsequent clowns); and Paul joined the act in a new role, the notary, with little makeup and a comic style midway between those of his brothers.
The Fratellinis toured Europe and Russia before joining the Cirque Medrano in Paris during World War I. By 1923 they were the toast of Paris, admired by the general public and by such intellectuals as the playwrights Raymond Radiguet and Jean Cocteau, both of whom created characters based on the Fratellinis.
Many of the Fratellini Brothers’ children also became circus performers, notably Paul’s son Victor (1901–79) and Victor’s daughter Annie (1932–97), who continued the family tradition as successful clowns in France. Albert’s memoirs, Nous, les Fratellini, appeared in 1955.
