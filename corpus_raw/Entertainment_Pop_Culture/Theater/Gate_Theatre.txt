Gate Theatre,  Dublin dramatic company, founded in 1928 by Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir, whose repertoire included works from many periods and countries, unlike that of the established Abbey Theatre.
From 1928 to 1930 the Gate Theatre made its home at the Peacock, then moved to its own building. The Abbey and the Irish National Theatre Society had provided a stage for national playwrights who concentrated on realism and everyday Irish life, seeking isolation from the European theatre. The Gate, on the other hand, sought to foster the development of writers with new subjects and styles, and its performances resembled those in other parts of Europe.
Edwards and MacLiammóir expanded on the National Theatre Society’s work, producing classics and continental plays that attracted such actors as James Mason and Orson Welles. Their repertoire embraced a wide range of writers, from William Shakespeare, Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and George Bernard Shaw to Denis Johnston, An Philibin, Mary Manning, and David Sears. Longford Productions, a company with comparable goals, shared the theatre from 1936 to 1961. Beginning in 1969, the Gate received a government subsidy that allowed it to renovate the theatre and continue producing its eclectic repertoire, including the earliest works of Irish playwright Brian Friel.
