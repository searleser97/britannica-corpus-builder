Pasadena Playhouse,   theatre in Pasadena, California, that was one of the first community theatres in the United States. It was founded in 1917–18 when Gilmor Brown organized a semiprofessional acting company known as the Pasadena Community Playhouse Association. The group obtained its own 700-seat theatre (the Pasadena Playhouse) in 1925, and it went on to acquire a nationwide reputation for its productions of both Shakespearean classics and new works by such playwrights as Eugene O’Neill, Noel Coward, and Tennessee Williams. The Playhouse’s highly regarded acting school trained many actors who went on to success in Hollywood, among them Tyrone Power, Robert Taylor, William Holden, Eleanor Parker, David Niven, Lee J. Cobb, Gene Hackman, and Charles Bronson. The Playhouse flourished until the 1950s, when it fell on hard times, and it closed in the late 1960s. The Pasadena Playhouse theatre building reopened in 1986, however.
