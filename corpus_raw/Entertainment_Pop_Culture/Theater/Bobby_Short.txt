Bobby Short, byname of Robert Waltrip Short,  (born Sept. 15, 1924, Danville, Ill., U.S.—died March 21, 2005, New York, N.Y.), American cabaret singer and piano player who in his personal and performance style came to represent a sophistication and elegance typical of an earlier era.
At age 9 Short was already playing piano in roadhouses and saloons near his childhood home; at 12 he played his first shows in New York City. As a young man he was booked in nightclubs throughout the United States. Echoing his reputation as a stylish dresser, he developed a performance style that was both intimate and polished. He had a legendary 36-year run (1968–2004) at the Café Carlyle in the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. In 2005 he gave a final performance to celebrate the nightclub’s 50th anniversary.
Short established himself as a New York institution, winning fans and friends among the city’s social and artistic elite. His stride style of piano matched well with his velvet baritone, and he earned a reputation as a master of jazz standards, especially noted for his renditions of works by Duke Ellington, Eubie Blake, Fats Waller, and Cole Porter. Short’s best-known albums include Mabel Mercer and Bobby Short at Town Hall (1968) and Late Night at the Café Carlyle (1993). He had small roles in several films and commercials, and he published two memoirs, Black and White Baby (1971) and Bobby Short: The Life and Times of a Saloon Singer (1995).
