Eddie Cantor, original name Edward Israel Iskowitz,  (born January 31, 1892, New York, New York, U.S.—died October 10, 1964, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California), American comedian and star of vaudeville, burlesque, the legitimate stage, radio, and television.
Cantor was cared for by his grandmother on New York City’s Lower East Side when he was orphaned at age two. From early childhood he clowned and sang for coins on street corners, and he developed a talent for mimicry. When he was 12, he attended a summer camp for youngsters sponsored by the Young Men’s Hebrew Association (YMHA) where his impersonations were enthusiastically received. He dropped out of elementary school to work but could not keep a job, because of his irrepressible clowning. He won an amateur-night competition at a theatre in the Bowery district and was on his way into vaudeville as a blackface song-and-dance man. He toured with various theatre companies including Ziegfeld’s and the Schuberts. He appeared in such Broadway reviews as Broadway Brevities (1920) and Make It Snappy (1922), and from 1923 to 1926 he was a star in Kid Boots.
After he had attained Broadway stardom, Cantor turned to radio with The Chase and Sanborn Hour in September 1931. Performing as a standup comedian, he used his vaudeville experience to outstanding effect and combined the expression of patriotism and personal values with humour; audiences responded enthusiastically. With changes of name, the show continued for 18 years on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) networks. He also served as host of The Eddie Cantor Variety Theater, a half-hour television variety show that was syndicated in 1955.
