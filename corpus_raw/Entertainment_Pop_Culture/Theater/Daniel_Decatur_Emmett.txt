Daniel Decatur Emmett,  (born October 29, 1815, Mount Vernon, Ohio, U.S.—died June 28, 1904, Mount Vernon), U.S. composer of “Dixie” and organizer of one of the first minstrel show troupes.
Emmett was the son of a blacksmith. He joined the army at age 17 as a fifer, and after his discharge in 1835, he played the drum in travelling circus bands. He was also a capable violinist, flutist, and singer. In 1843 in New York City, he and three coperformers organized the Virginia Minstrels, a troupe that competes with the Christy Minstrels for recognition as the earliest minstrel show troupe. In 1858 Emmett joined the Bryant Minstrels.
His song “Dixie,” written in 1859, was originally a “walk-around,” or concluding number for a minstrel show. It attained national popularity and was later the unofficial national anthem of the Confederacy during the American Civil War (1861–65) and of the South thereafter. Several sets of words, Northern and Southern, were written for the song, but it survives in its version with Emmett’s words. Emmett retired in 1888 but subsequently toured in 1895 with A.G. Field’s minstrel troupe.
