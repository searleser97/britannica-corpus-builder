Franz Schuch,  (born c. 1716, Vienna [Austria]—died 1763, Hamburg [Germany]), German comic actor and theatre manager who popularized a vernacular version of the commedia dell’arte form and merged the Italian stock character Harlequin with the German stock character Hans Wurst.
Schuch arrived in Germany with his itinerant company in the 1740s and remained there until his death. Under his management the troupe was extremely popular and created serious competition for the new literary theatre companies such as that of Caroline Neuber. Schuch’s troupe achieved sufficient success to attract Konrad Ekhof, the greatest German actor of his day, to work with them for a brief period and later employed the actor-playwright Johann Brandes. Although Johann Gottsched, the prominent dramatic theorist and patron of Neuber, sought to eliminate improvisational troupes, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, the playwright and critic, greatly admired Schuch’s company.
Schuch’s acting possessed a quality of commonness untainted by triviality or grossness. The work of his company was appreciably more refined than that of earlier groups, yet it was sufficiently rooted in the everyday to maintain a wide popularity. Although improvisation of dialogue and physical comedy remained central features, the general structure of the entertainments was more controlled and was presented with greater subtlety. Schuch habitually played the sly servant of the commedia, Harlequin, but he modified the character and gave it popular national appeal by lending him features of the by-then traditional Hans Wurst.
Schuch’s sons mismanaged the company after Schuch’s death, but in 1765 Karl Döbbelin moved it to Berlin and put it back on a sound financial basis.
