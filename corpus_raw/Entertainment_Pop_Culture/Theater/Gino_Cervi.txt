Gino Cervi,  (born May 3, 1901, Bologna, Italy—died  Jan. 3, 1974, Punta Ala), Italian character actor and manager best-known outside of Italy for his film portrayal of a small-town Communist mayor in the “Don Camillo” films.
The son of a theatre critic, Cervi worked with various theatres for 15 years (1924–39) until he became the manager of Rome’s Teatro Eliseo. His portrayals of Feste in Twelfth Night (1938) and Falstaff in The Merry Wives of Windsor (1939) established him as the foremost Italian comedian in classic roles.
After World War II, Cervi and the Eliseo company mounted Italian premieres of new foreign works; his George in Cocteau’s Les Parents terribles (1945; Intimate Relations) and Hector in Giraudoux’s Tiger at the Gates (1946) further enhanced his reputation. His outstanding theatrical accomplishment, however, was his portrayal of the title role in Cyrano de Bergerac (1953), an interpretation that was enthusiastically received, even in Paris. Cervi’s film work also achieved international acclaim after the war, when director Alessandro Blasetti’s Quattro Passi fra le Nuvole (1942; “Four Steps in the Clouds”) was released outside of Italy. The Little World of Don Camillo (1951), a French-Italian screen venture costarring Cervi and the French comedian Fernandel, was so successful that five Don Camillo sequels were produced before the death of Fernandel in 1971. Cervi appeared in more than 110 motion pictures and played the part of police inspector Maigret in a popular Italian television series based upon the detective novels of the French writer Georges Simenon. His son, Tonino Cervi, became a film producer.
