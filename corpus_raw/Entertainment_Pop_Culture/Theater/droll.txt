Droll, in full Droll-humour, or Drollery,  short comic scene or farce adapted from an existing play or created by actors, performed in England during the period of the Civil Wars and the Commonwealth (1642–60) while the London theatres were closed down by the Puritans. Because stage plays were prohibited at this time, actors developed other, shorter means of entertainment to circumvent the restrictions, performing drolls in inns and at fairs on improvised stages.
Robert Cox was the leading performer of drolls, and his repertoire included “The Merry Conceits of Bottom the Weaver” from A Midsummer Night’s Dream and “The Bouncing Knight, or The Robbers Rob’d” from Henry IV, Part I. Other subjects of drolls were Falstaff, the grave-diggers’ scene in Hamlet, and, occasionally, biblical adaptations. Francis Kirkman published a collection of 26 drolls in 1662 titled The Wits; or, Sport upon Sport.
