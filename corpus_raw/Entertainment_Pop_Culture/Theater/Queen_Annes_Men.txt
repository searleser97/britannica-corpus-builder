Queen Anne’s Men, also known as Queen’s Men,  theatrical company in Jacobean England. Formed upon the accession of James I in 1603, it was an amalgamation of Oxford’s Men and Worcester’s Men. Christopher Beeston served as the troupe’s manager, and the playwright Thomas Heywood wrote works exclusively for Queen Anne’s Men. The company’s varied repertoire included comedies, dramas, and history plays. Queen Anne’s Men originally performed at the Curtain, but left in 1606 for the Red Bull, where they played until 1616. The company then moved to the Cockpit (after 1618 also called the Phoenix), and, after the death of Queen Anne in 1619, Queen Anne’s Men disbanded.
