Lilian Mary Baylis,  (born May 9, 1874, London, Eng.—died  Nov. 25, 1937, London), English theatrical manager and founder of the Old Vic as a centre of Shakespearean productions.
As a child, Baylis studied the violin, and she performed in concert with her parents, who were singers. In 1890 the family moved to South Africa, where Baylis later became a music teacher. She returned to England in 1898 to assist her aunt, Emma Cons, who had turned the Victoria Theatre (originally the Royal Coburg Theatre) into a temperance hall under the name of the Royal Victoria Hall and Coffee Tavern (1880–1912).
Upon Cons’s death in 1912, Baylis became sole manager and converted the hall into the Old Vic, which became world famous as the home of Shakespearean productions. Between 1914 and 1923 the theatre staged all of William Shakespeare’s plays—a feat no other modern playhouse had attempted. The productions mounted under Baylis’s management were praised for their simplicity and outstanding acting. In 1931 she took over the derelict Sadler’s Wells Theatre and made it a centre of opera and ballet. Baylis was created a Companion of Honour in 1929.
