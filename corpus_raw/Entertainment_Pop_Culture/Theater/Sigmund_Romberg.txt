Sigmund Romberg,  (born July 29, 1887, Nagykanizsa, Austria-Hungary [now in Hungary]—died November 9, 1951, New York, New York, U.S.), Hungarian-born American composer whose works include several successful operettas.
Romberg was educated in Vienna as an engineer, but he also studied composition and became a skilled violinist and organist. In 1909 he went to New York City. There, as conductor of an orchestra in a fashionable restaurant, he started the practice, then rare, of playing music for dancing.
Employed as staff composer by the impresario Jacob Shubert, Romberg prepared scores for about 40 musical shows. His first outstanding operetta, Maytime, was produced in 1917. Blossom Time (1921), based on the life of Franz Schubert, featured songs derived from that composer’s works. There followed in the 1920s a series of operettas popular for their romantic plots and richly melodic songs. They include the operetta The Student Prince (1924; based on the German play Alt Heidelberg by Wilhelm Meyer-Förster), with the songs “Deep in My Heart” and “Drinking Song”; The Desert Song (1926), remembered for the title song and “One Alone”; and The New Moon (1928), with “Lover, Come Back to Me” (melody adapted in part from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s June: Barcarolle).
From 1929 Romberg wrote songs for motion pictures and in 1933 composed an operetta, Rose de France, produced in Paris. In 1942–43 he led a series of concerts, “An Evening with Sigmund Romberg.” His last successful work was a musical comedy, Up in Central Park (1945).
