Rose Theatre,   London playhouse built by Philip Henslowe and in active use from 1587 until about 1605. Henslowe and his partner, John Cholmley, had the theatre constructed on a leased rose garden on the South Bank of the Thames. The building was octagonal in shape, partly thatched, and made of timber and plaster on a brick foundation.
Details of the early years of operation are unknown, but in 1592 Lord Strange’s Men, in company with some of the Admiral’s Men and the actor Edward Alleyn, took up residence at the Rose. They presented Robert Greene’s Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay, Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy, Christopher Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta, and William Shakespeare’s Henry VI, Part 1. Sussex’s Men occupied the Rose in 1593–94, giving the first performance of Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus. Alleyn, who had married Henslowe’s stepdaughter, brought the Admiral’s Men to the Rose in 1594. In 1600, with the Rose in bad repair and suffering from the competition of the newly opened Globe Theatre, Henslowe built a new theatre, the Fortune, to the north of the city, and the Admiral’s Men transferred there. The Rose was used sporadically until Henslowe’s lease expired in 1605 and was torn down shortly thereafter.
In 1989 the building foundations of the Rose Theatre were rediscovered in London during a construction project. From these remains it was calculated that the theatre had had a diameter of about 70 feet (21 m) and a seating capacity of about 2,200. The foundations were subsequently preserved as an unofficial historic site.
