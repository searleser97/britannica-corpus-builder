Julian Eltinge, original name William Dalton,  (born May 14, 1883, Newtonville, Mass., U.S.â€”died March 7, 1941, New York, N.Y.), American vaudeville star, often called the greatest female impersonator in theatrical history.
Eltinge played his first female role at age 10. A graduate of Harvard, he entered vaudeville in 1904, soon commanding one of the highest salaries in show business. During a successful tour of the United States and Europe in 1907, he gave a command performance for King Edward VII. His stage successes included The Fascinating Widow (1911), written for him, in which he played the dual role of Mrs. Monte and Hal Blake; The Crinoline Girl (1914); and Cousin Lucy (1915). He continued working in vaudeville from 1918 to 1927 and also starred in several silent motion pictures. Women admired his wardrobe and were his greatest fans.
