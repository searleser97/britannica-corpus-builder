Sir George Robey, original name George Edward Wade,  (born Sept. 20, 1869, Herue Hill, Kent, Eng.—died Nov. 29, 1954, Saltdean, Sussex), English music-hall comedian known for many years as “the prime minister of mirth.”
Robey made his first appearance on the professional stage in 1891, and of his numerous character roles, the most famous—the collarless cleric with the red nose, the startled and heavy black eyebrows, the indignant stare, the ribald smile—was a quite early development. He entertained London audiences during World War I with The Bing Boys Are Here, a jovial musical comedy, and for 15 years thereafter he toured in his own revues and with his own companies. In 1932 he played King Menelaus in a lavish production of Offenbach’s Helen! and three years later he played Falstaff in Henry IV (Part I). He was best known for his extravagant characterizations, precise diction, and comic timing.
Robey appeared in many pantomimes and films and in countless music-hall performances. A tireless perfectionist, he worked hard until his retirement at the age of 80. He was knighted in 1954.
