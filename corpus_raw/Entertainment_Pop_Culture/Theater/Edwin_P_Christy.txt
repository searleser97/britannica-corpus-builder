Edwin P. Christy,  (born May 21, 1815, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  May 21, 1862, New York, N.Y.), early American minstrel show performer who founded (c. 1842) the Christy Minstrels, the most important of the early minstrel companies, and who originated the format of the typical minstrel show (q.v.).
Details of his early life are unknown. He first performed with his Christy Minstrels in Buffalo, N.Y., in 1842. Four years later his troupe appeared in New York City and played there successfully for nearly 10 years. During this period Stephen Foster wrote some of his best-known songs for Christy’s shows. The troupe’s later appearance in England popularized minstrel shows in music halls for many years and made “Christy minstrels” or “Christys” synonymous with that type of entertainment. After Christy retired in 1854, the troupe continued without him. He died after jumping from a window while insane.
