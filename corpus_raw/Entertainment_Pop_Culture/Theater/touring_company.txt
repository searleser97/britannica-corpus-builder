Touring company, also called road company,  cast of actors assembled to bring a hit play to a succession of regional centres after the play has closed in a theatrical capital. It may include some members of the playâ€™s original cast but seldom all of them. Though strolling players are as old as drama itself, the touring company formed for this purpose developed in Europe and the United States in the 19th century with the growth of railway transportation, which facilitated travel and shipment of sets. The early effect of touring companies was to centralize dramatic activity in capitals such as London and New York City and to stifle the growth of professional regional stock companies.
