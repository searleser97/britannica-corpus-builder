Rudolf Friml, in full Rudolf Charles Friml,   (born Dec. 7, 1879, Prague, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now in Czech Republic]—died Nov. 12, 1972, Hollywood, Calif., U.S.), American composer of operettas. Showing strong European musical influences, his work suggested pre-World War I European lightheartedness.
After study under the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák at the Prague Conservatory, Friml served as piano accompanist for the violinist Jan Kubelík in Europe and the United States, where he remained from 1906. In 1912 he was hired to replace Victor Herbert as composer of an operetta proposed for the singer Emma Trentini. The result, The Firefly (book and lyrics by Otto Harbach), was highly successful. In the 1920s Friml achieved his greatest popularity. Rose Marie (1924; book and lyrics by Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein II), best remembered for the song “Indian Love Call,” was followed in 1925 by The Vagabond King (book and lyrics by Brian Hooker and W.H. Post), with its popular songs “Only a Rose” and “Some Day,” and in 1928 by The Three Musketeers (book and lyrics by Clifford Grey and P.G. Wodehouse). From 1934 Friml composed for motion pictures. His last important song, “The Donkey Serenade” (composed with Herbert Stothart; words by Chet Forrest and Bob Wright), was interpolated into a film version (1937) of The Firefly.
