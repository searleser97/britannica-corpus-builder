Sir Charles Blake Cochran,  (born Sept. 25, 1872, Lindfield, Sussex, Eng.—died  Jan. 31, 1951, London), leading British impresario and theatrical producer between World Wars I and II, best known for his musical revues. A colourful showman, he also owned a flea circus and produced boxing matches, circuses, rodeos, and a travelling medicine show during his long and varied career.
An actor at 17, before World War I Cochran was an agent, promoter, and producer of such lavish spectacles as Max Reinhardt’s Miracle (1911). During the war he introduced the small-scale intimate revue at the Ambassadors’ Theatre in London (Odds and Ends, 1914). He later produced more spectacular revues at the London Pavillion, introducing and promoting such famous stars as Beatrice Lillie, Noël Coward, Eleonora Duse, and Sacha Guitry. Cochran and Coward collaborated in several productions, including This Year of Grace (1928), Private Lives (1930), and Cavalcade (1931). Altogether Cochran produced 128 plays and revues in London and several in New York. He was knighted in 1948.
Cochran’s first volume of memoirs, The Secrets of a Showman (1925), was followed by four more: Review of Revues (1930), I Had Almost Forgotten (1932), Cock-a-Doodle-Do (1941), and Showman Looks On (1945).
