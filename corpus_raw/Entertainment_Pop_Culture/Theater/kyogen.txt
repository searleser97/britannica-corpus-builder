Kyōgen,  brief farce or comic interlude played during a Japanese Noh (lyric drama) cycle, expressed in the vernacular of the second half of the 16th century.
Its effect is to relieve the tension of the drama. It is performed in ordinary dress and without masks (unless these are used in parody). There are normally four kyōgen interspersed among the usual five Noh pieces. Over time, kyōgen developed into an independent dramatic form, and ai-kyōgen came to refer specifically to Noh interludes.
