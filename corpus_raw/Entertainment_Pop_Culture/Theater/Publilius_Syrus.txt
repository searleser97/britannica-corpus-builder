Publilius Syrus,  (flourished 1st century bc), Latin mime writer contemporary with Cicero, chiefly remembered for a collection of versified aphorisms that were extracted by scholars from his mimes, probably in the 1st century ad.
Early incorporation of non-Publilian verses and scribal distortions of authentic lines in these have considerably aggravated the labours of the textual critic. Modern editions contain more than 700 verses, alphabetically arranged; most of these are iambic senarii, some trochaic septenarii. Publilius, who went to Rome as a slave from Syria, was soon manumitted. He defeated the veteran mime writer Decimus Laberius in a contest held in 45 bc, when the latter was “invited” by Julius Caesar to perform in one of his own mimes.
