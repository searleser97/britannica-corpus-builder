Jiří Trnka,  (born February 24, 1912, Pilsen, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now Plzeň, Czech Republic]—died Dec. 30, 1969, Prague, Czechoslovakia), preeminent filmmaker of the Czech puppet animation tradition who was also a painter, designer, cartoonist, and book illustrator.
Trnka, who was trained as a painter in art school, won a design competition organized by the Czech puppeteer Josef Skupa in 1921. He worked with Skupa at his studios for more than 10 years, but his own efforts to start a puppet theatre failed. By 1935 he was designing for the stage and illustrating children’s books. Between 1938 and 1945 he primarily worked as a designer for the National Theatre in Prague but also illustrated many children’s books.
In 1945 Trnka turned to animation and produced his first film, Zasadil dĕdek repu (Grandpa Planted a Beet). His first puppet film appeared in 1947, part of a cycle called Spalíček (The Czech Year). After that, nearly all his films were made with puppets. Among the most notable are Císařův slavik (1948; The Emperor’s Nightingale), Arie prérie (1949; Song of the Prairie), Dobrý Vojak Švejk (1954; The Good Soldier Schweik), Sen Noci Svatojanské (1959; A Midsummer Night’s Dream), considered by some critics to be his masterpiece, and Ruka (1964; The Hand). Trnka redesigned puppets especially for the camera: their range of movement was limited, their heads were enlarged, and their facial expressions were limited chiefly to the area around the eyes.
