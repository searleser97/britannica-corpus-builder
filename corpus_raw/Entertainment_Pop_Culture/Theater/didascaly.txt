Didascaly,  the instruction or training of the chorus in ancient Greek drama. The word is from the Greek didaskalía, “teaching or instruction.” The Greek plural noun didaskaliai (“instructions”) came to refer to records of dramatic performances, containing names of authors and dates, in the form of the original inscriptions or as later published by Alexandrian scholars.
