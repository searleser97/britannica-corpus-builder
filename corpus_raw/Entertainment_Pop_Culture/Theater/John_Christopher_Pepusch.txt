John Christopher Pepusch, German Johann Christoph Pepusch,  (born 1667, Berlin [Germany]—died  July 20, 1752, London, Eng.), composer who was an important musical figure in England when George Frideric Handel was active there.
After studying theory and organ music, Pepusch at age 14 obtained a position at the Prussian court; he remained there until 1697. He traveled to the Netherlands and after 1700 settled in England. He took a doctorate in music from the University of Oxford in 1713 and soon became music director to the duke of Chandos. In the 1720s he became music director at Lincoln’s Inn Fields Theatre, for which he wrote several masques and arranged the tunes and composed the overtures for John Gay’s Beggar’s Opera (1728) and its sequel Polly (unperformed until 1777). In 1737 he became organist at the Charterhouse. Pepusch was in demand as a teacher; William Boyce was among his pupils. He also collected a magnificent library of music books and scores. Interested in music of the Renaissance and of ancient Greece and Rome, he strongly influenced early musical antiquarianism in England; one result was the publication of Boyce’s anthology Cathedral Music (of 16th- and 17th-century England). Pepusch helped form the Academy of Ancient Music, which performed works by 16th-century composers, and edited some works of Arcangelo Corelli. Pepusch’s own  compositions include cantatas, concerti, and chamber music.
