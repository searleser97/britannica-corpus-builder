Mariinsky Theatre, also spelled Maryinsky Theatre, formerly Kirov Theatre,  Russian imperial theatre in St. Petersburg. The theatre opened in 1860 and was named for Maria Aleksandrovna, wife of the reigning tsar. Ballet was not performed there until 1880 and was presented regularly only after 1889, when the Imperial Russian Ballet became its resident company and acquired the Mariinsky name. The theatre’s name was changed to the State Academic Theatre (1917–35) and later to the S.M. Kirov (for Sergey Mironovich Kirov) State Academic Theatre for Opera and Ballet (1935–91); it reverted to its original name in 1991. Its resident ballet company, the celebrated Mariinsky (or Kirov) Ballet, tours worldwide.
