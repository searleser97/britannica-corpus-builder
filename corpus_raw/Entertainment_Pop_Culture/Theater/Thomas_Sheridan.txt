Thomas Sheridan,  (born 1719, Dublin, Ire.—died  Aug. 14, 1788, Margate, Kent, Eng.), Irish-born actor and theatrical manager and father of the dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan.
While an undergraduate at Trinity College, Dublin, Sheridan wrote a farce, The Brave Irishman, or Captain O’Blunder, and after a successful appearance as Richard III at the Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, in 1743, determined on an acting career. His first London appearance came in 1744 at Covent Garden, where he played a number of leading roles, including Hamlet. In 1747 he became manager of the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin and married Frances Chamberlaine, a novelist. As an actor, he was described as having conceptions superior to his powers of execution but occasionally rising to greatness. Through Sheridan’s efforts, Samuel Johnson was given a pension. John Stuart, Lord Bute, was impressed with Sheridan’s scheme for a pronouncing dictionary and granted him a pension of £200 a year. In 1764 Sheridan took his family to France, returning after his wife’s death in 1766. He published A Plan of Education for the Young Nobility and Gentry (1769) and A general dictionary of the English language (1780). He also assisted in the management of Drury Lane Theatre.
