Blackfriars Theatre,  either of two separate theatres, the second famed as the winter quarters (after 1608) of the King’s Men, the company of actors for whom Shakespeare served as chief playwright and also as a performer.
The name of the theatres derives from their location on the site of a 13th-century Dominican (the Black Friars) priory lying within the City of London between the River Thames and Ludgate Hill. The estates of the priory were split up in 1538 at the suppression of the English monasteries under Henry VIII, and in 1576, under Elizabeth I, Richard Farrant, Master of the Children of the Chapel, leased part of the buildings along the western side of the priory cloisters so that the children could present their plays in this “private” theatre before performing them at court. Other children’s companies also acted there until 1584, when the buildings reverted to their owner.
In 1596 another part of the old monastery was bought by James Burbage (the father of actor Richard Burbage), who converted it into a theatre. Opposition to the scheme forced him to lease it to children’s companies. Richard Burbage, who was a principal actor with the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, acted at the Globe Theatre. He inherited the second Blackfriars Theatre in 1597, and in 1608 he formed a company of “owners” (called housekeepers) along the lines of that operating at the Globe Theatre. His company of players (by now called the King’s Men) played at the Blackfriars during the winter seasons. Shakespeare’s later plays were performed there, as were works by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher.
The Blackfriars was forced to close on the outbreak of the English Civil Wars in 1642. It was demolished in 1655. Its site is today commemorated by Playhouse Yard.
