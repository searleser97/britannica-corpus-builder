Dan Rice, original name Daniel Mclaren,  (born Jan. 25, 1823, New York Cityâ€”died  Feb. 22, 1900, Long Branch, N.J., U.S.), American clown who was one of the most highly acclaimed clowns in the history of the circus. Rice was renowned for an act that included singing, dancing, witty badinage with the audience, feats of strength, trick riding, and exhibitions of trained wild animals.
He was a jockey as a boy and started his circus career at 17, when he bought a half interest in a trained pig. Next he was a strong man, and in 1844 he made his debut as a clown. A star of the one-ring circus, Rice achieved national prominence as an equestrian jester. By the 1860s he was at the height of his career, commanding the then-phenomenal salary of $1,000 a week. He toured the United States with his own one-horse show and with other circuses and was recognized everywhere by the Uncle Sam beard that was his trademark. President Zachary Taylor made Rice an honorary colonel; in 1868 he put himself forward for the Republican nomination for the presidency. An alcoholic, Rice began walking out on contracts, and in 1885 he made his last tour.
