Mind reading,   a magician’s trick involving various silent or verbal signals that cue a conjurer to answer a question as though with second sight. Philip Breslaw, the first magician of note to feature mind reading, played in 1781 at the Haymarket Theatre in London to appreciative audiences. In 1784 the Pinettis, a husband-and-wife team, advertised Mrs. Pinetti as able to guess the thoughts of the audience. In the 19th century, Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin, Robert Heller, Compars Herrmann, and Henri Robin also used mind reading as part of their repertoire. In the 20th century there were Harry Houdini, Joseph Dunninger, and the Amazing Kreskin.
Drawing on carefully devised alphabetical and numerical arrangements and on certain methods of conveying signals, the conjurer would guess personal names and numbers. Another arrangement of objects into sets, verbal cues, and numerical signals allowed the magician to guess objects in the hands of audience members. With the aid of electricity, Robert Heller was able to answer questions correctly by using a silent signal.
