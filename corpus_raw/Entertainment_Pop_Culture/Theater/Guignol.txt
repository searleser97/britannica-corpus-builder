Guignol,   most prominent puppet character in France, where his name became synonymous with puppet theatre. The hand puppet was created by the puppeteer Laurent Mourguet of Lyons in the early 19th century and was supposedly named for an actual canut, or Lyonnais silk worker. Guignol was performed with regional dialect and mannerisms and in the traditional garb of the peasant. Short-nosed, round-eyed, and perpetually surprised, he was easily duped but quick to extricate himself from trouble and to help his friends and drinking companions. Though sometimes approximating a Lyonnais version of the Punch-and-Judy show, Guignol usually appeared in his own plays featuring his wife, Madelon, and his companion, Gnafron.
Guignol puppet shows, now staged mainly for children, demand a vigorous participation. Audiences actively respond and react to questions voiced by the puppets. Guignol remains a popular figure in France, where permanent Guignol theatre may be seen in the streets of Paris.
