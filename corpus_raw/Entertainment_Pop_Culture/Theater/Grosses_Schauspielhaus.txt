Grosses Schauspielhaus, (German: “Great Playhouse”)  theatre in Berlin designed by architect Hans Poelzig in 1919 for the theatrical director Max Reinhardt.
Poelzig renovated the Zirkus Schumann, an amphitheatre, to create the Grosses Schauspielhaus. Its combination of a normal stage with a revolving stage and a cyclorama was innovative for its time. The stage was connected through an adjustable forestage with an arena surrounded by a horseshoe of seating. In 1919–21 Reinhardt there presented a series of magnificent spectacles that included the Oresteia, Danton’s Death, and Julius Caesar. The theatre was later demolished.
