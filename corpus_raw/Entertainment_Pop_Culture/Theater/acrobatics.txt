Acrobatics,   (Greek: “to walk on tip-toe,” or “to climb up”), the specialized and ancient art of jumping, tumbling, and balancing, often later with the use of such apparatus as poles, one-wheel cycles, balls, barrels, tightropes, trampolines, and flying trapezes.
In 1859 the invention of the flying trapeze by J. Léotard, as well as Charles Blondin’s crossing of Niagara Falls on a tightrope, rekindled public interest in aerial gymnasts and acrobats. Although the trapeze had never been seen before, ropedancing can be traced back to ancient Greece.
By the turn of the century, acrobatics were important in the circus. About 1900 the Scheffers, Craggs, Hanlon-Voltas, Sandow, Lauck and Fox, Cinquevalli, Caicedo, and the Potters were the most prominent European and U.S. acrobats. Later, the Concellos and Codonas on the flying trapeze, Con Colleano on the tightwire, and the juggler Enrico Rastelli captivated audiences with their skill and daring. Popular mid-20th-century acrobats were the Wallendas, a family of high-wire artists originally from Germany. Traditionally, acrobatics and tumbling were the province of eastern Europeans.
Acrobatics are performed in fairgrounds, circuses, and theatres. They are also related to movements of modern gymnastics and of certain theatre genres, such as the Peking Opera.
