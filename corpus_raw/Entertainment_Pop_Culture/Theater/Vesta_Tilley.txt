Vesta Tilley, original name Matilda Alice Victoria Powles, married name Lady de Frece,  (born May 13, 1864, Worcester, Worcestershire, Eng.—died Sept. 16, 1952, London), English singing comedienne who was the outstanding male impersonator in music-hall history.
The daughter of a music-hall performer, she appeared on the stage at three and first played in male attire two years later. Before she was 14, she was playing in two different London music halls each evening. From then until her retirement in 1920, Tilley performed in pantomimes and headed the variety bill as a male impersonator in London, in the English provinces, and in the United States. In 1890 she married Walter de Frece (later Sir Walter), the composer of many of her songs and a music hall impresario who in 1920 became a member of Parliament. Two songs for which she was famous are “The Piccadilly Johnny with the Little Glass Eye” and “Following in Father’s Footsteps.”
