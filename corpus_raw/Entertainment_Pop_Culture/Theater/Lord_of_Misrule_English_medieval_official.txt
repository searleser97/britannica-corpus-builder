Lord of Misrule, also called Abbot Of Misrule, or King Of Misrule,  official of the late medieval and early Tudor period in England, who was specially appointed to manage the Christmas festivities held at court, in the houses of great noblemen, in the law schools of the Inns of Court, and in many of the colleges at the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. During his reign, which lasted anywhere from 12 days to 3 months, the Lord of Misrule was responsible for arranging and directing all Christmas entertainment, including elaborate masques and processions, plays, and feasts. The lord himself usually presided over these affairs with a mock court and received comic homage from the revelers.
Scotland had an official similar to the Lord of Misrule, known as the Abbot of Unreason (suppressed in 1555), and both are thought by scholars to be descended from the “king” or “bishop” who presided over the earlier Feast of Fools. Another related functionary was the Boy Bishop, the leader of children’s Christmas festivities in the choir schools.
After the death of Edward VI in 1553, the English court ceased to appoint a Lord of Misrule. See also Master of the Revels.
