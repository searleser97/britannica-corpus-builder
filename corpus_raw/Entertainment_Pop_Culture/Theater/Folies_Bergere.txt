Folies-Bergère,   Parisian music hall and variety-entertainment theatre that is one of the major tourist attractions of France. Following its opening in a new theatre on May 1, 1869, the Folies became one of the first major music halls in Paris. During its early years it presented a mixed program of operetta and pantomime, with the renowned mime Pierre Legrand performing the latter.
In 1887 the Folies’ highly popular revue entitled “Place aux Jeunes” established it as the premiere nightspot in Paris. By the last decade of the 19th century, the theatre’s repertory encompassed musical comedies and revues, operettas, vaudeville sketches, playlets, ballets, eccentric dancers, acrobats, jugglers, tightrope walkers, and magicians. When the vogue of nudity seized the music halls of Paris in 1894, the Folies elaborated it to such an extent that the theatre’s reputation for sensational displays of female nudity came to overshadow its other performances.
The Folies achieved international repute under the management of Paul Derval (from 1918 to 1966). He staged a series of sumptuous and grandiose spectacles featuring beautiful young women parading in a state of near nudity (despite their gaudy costumes) against exotic backdrops. Parisians and tourists alike were also attracted to the singers, acrobats, and dramatic sketches that made up the rest of the program. The Folies has showcased the talents of many of the great entertainers and music-hall artists of France from the late 19th century on. Among these have been Yvette Guilbert, Mistinguett, Fernandel, Josephine Baker, and Maurice Chevalier.
The Folies-Bergère was managed by Hélène Martini from 1974. Each of its shows requires about 10 months of planning and preparation, 40 different sets, and 1,000 to 1,200 individually designed costumes. The titles of all the Folies’ shows since the late 1880s have each consisted of a total of 13 letters.
