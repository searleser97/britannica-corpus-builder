Floridor, original name Josias De Soulas, Sieur (lord) De Prinefosse,  (born 1608?, the Brie district, Fr.—died  August 1671, Paris), French leading actor who headed the important troupe of the Théâtre de l’Hôtel de Bourgogne, in Paris, where he created many roles in plays by the French masters Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine.
The son of a German father, he entered the French army and was promoted to ensign but later resigned to become an actor under the name of Floridor. He joined a group of players that performed in London in 1635 before the English court and at the French Players’ Theatre, a playhouse temporarily set up in Drury Lane, London. For a brief time he was affiliated with Filandre (Jean-Baptiste de Mouchaingre), an influential French actor-manager, who was reputed to have been his teacher and with whom he made provincial tours. During that period, he joined the troupe at the Théâtre du Marais, with whom he made his Parisian debut in 1640.
Floridor was called (around 1643) to the Hôtel de Bourgogne, a move that possibly influenced Corneille to give that theatre his later plays instead of giving them to the Marais. He succeeded the French actor Bellerose (Pierre le Messier) as head of the Bourgogne, where he played all the leading parts in tragedy and comedy, becoming one of France’s finest actors. His company was unrivalled in Paris until Molière’s arrival there in 1658. Molière’s play L’Impromptu de Versailles (1663), which ridiculed the Bourgogne troupe, spared only Floridor from mockery. He retired, because of illness, shortly before his death.
