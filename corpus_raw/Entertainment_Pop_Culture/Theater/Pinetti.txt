Pinetti, also called Chevalier Pinetti, in full Giuseppe Pinetti de Wildalle,  (born 1750, Orbetello, Italy—died  1800, Russia), conjurer who founded the classical school of magic, characterized by elaborate tricks and the use of mechanical devices (suitable, as a rule, for stage performance only). While touring Europe in the 1780s, he introduced the second-sight trick (the apparent transference of thought from the magician to his assistant), automata, and escape tricks, including chain releases and escape from the “thumb tie.” He used elaborate stage apparatus and draped tables, with trapdoors operated by offstage assistants.
