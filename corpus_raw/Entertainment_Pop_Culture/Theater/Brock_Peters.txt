Brock Peters, pseudonym of George Fisher,  (born July 2, 1927, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died Aug. 23, 2005, Los Angeles, Calif.), American actor who employed his powerful bass voice and strong presence in portrayals of a wide range of characters, notably in the role of Tom Robinson in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962).
Peters started acting on stage, appearing in musical productions such as Porgy and Bess (1943). In his early film roles—in Carmen Jones (1954) and a film adaptation of Porgy and Bess (1959)—he played a villain, but he avoided typecasting when he played a gay trumpet player in The L-Shaped Room (1962). That same year he gave a moving performance as a man falsely accused of rape in the film adaptation of Harper Lee’s novel To Kill a Mockingbird (published 1960). Peters also appeared in such films as The Pawnbroker (1965) and Soylent Green (1973). He starred as Admiral Cartwright in two Star Trek movies, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986) and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (1991).
He also appeared frequently on television, with noteworthy performances in the made-for-TV movie Roots: The Next Generations (1979), the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1996–98), and numerous animated shows for children. He continued to act on stage even after his initial success in film, taking the lead role in a Broadway revival of Maxwell Anderson’s Lost in the Stars (1972; filmed 1974), for which he received a Tony Award nomination. He also performed in Driving Miss Daisy (1989).
