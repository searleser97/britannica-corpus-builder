Chuanqi, Wade-Giles romanization ch’uan-ch’i,  a form of traditional Chinese operatic drama that developed from the nanxi in the late 14th century. Chuanqi alternated with the zaju as the major form of Chinese drama until the 16th century, when kunqu, a particular style of chuanqi, began to dominate serious Chinese drama. Highly subject to regional variations in language and music, chuanqi became popular throughout southern China. The average chuanqi was characterized by 30 to 50 changes of scene, the frequent and free change of end rhymes in arias, singing parts that were probably more languorous than those of the zaju and were distributed among many actors (not just the hero and heroine), and plots often taken from popular accounts of historical figures or from contemporary life.
