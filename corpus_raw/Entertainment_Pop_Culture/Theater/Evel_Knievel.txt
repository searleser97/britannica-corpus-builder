Evel Knievel, original name Robert Craig Knievel,  (born October 17, 1938, Butte, Montana, U.S.—died November 30, 2007, Clearwater, Florida), American motorcycle daredevil who captivated audiences with his death-defying stunts.
As a youth, Knievel was often jailed for stealing hubcaps and motorcycles, including a Harley-Davidson motorcycle at age 13. His brushes with the law led to a popular belief that the police gave him the nickname “Evil Knievel,” which he later modified to “Evel” and took as his legal name. After dropping out of high school, Knievel took several odd jobs that included working in the copper mines of Butte, Montana, where he caused a power outage by crashing an earthmover into the city’s main power line while attempting to do wheelies.
Knievel performed his first motorcycle stunt in his late 20s in order to stimulate business for a motorcycle shop that he co-owned; as part of the stunt, he jumped over rows of parked cars, a caged cougar, and a box of rattlesnakes. After performing (1965–68) with a troupe called Evel Knievel’s Motorcycle Daredevils, he decided to pursue a solo career. Clad in his trademark star-spangled red, white, and blue jumpsuits, Knievel made more than 300 jumps during his career and claimed to have broken nearly every bone in his body. In 1968 he performed perhaps his most famous stunt—a spectacular jump over the fountains at Caesars Palace Hotel in Las Vegas, in which he botched the landing and fractured his skull; he was comatose for a month afterward. Other well-publicized stunts included jumping over some 50 cars at the Los Angeles Coliseum (1973), a failed attempt to soar over the Snake River Canyon in Idaho using a rocket-powered motorcycle called the Sky-Cycle (1974), jumping over 13 buses at Wembley Stadium in London (1975), and leaping over a shark-filled tank in Chicago (1976).
