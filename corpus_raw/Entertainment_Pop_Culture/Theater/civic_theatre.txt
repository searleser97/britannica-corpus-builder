Civic theatre,  professional or amateur theatre that is wholly or partly subsidized by the city in which it is located.
The term is sometimes used interchangeably with community theatre, meaning a noncommercial, locally based group. European countries such as France, Denmark, and Germany have a long tradition of both national and municipal support for local theatre. In Great Britain, city governments are empowered to levy a tax to support theatrical productions. In contrast to the generally professional theatres of Europe, most civic theatres in the U.S. were at one time amateur, with a professional manager-director; later, the resident professional theatre became a civic theatre in effect. The first major U.S. civic theatre was Le Petit Théâtre de Vieux Carré, established in New Orleans in 1919. By the mid-20th century, civic theatres were often an important part of cultural centres.
