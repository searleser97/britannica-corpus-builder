sambal,  in Indonesian and Malaysian cuisines, a spicy relish served as a side dish. The basic sambal consists of fresh chilis, shrimp paste (trassi), lime juice, sugar, and salt. Though most sambals are uncooked, a sambal goreng is fried. Numberless variations can be created by the addition of vegetables, fruits, meats, and more seasonings, notably ketjap manis, a sweet spiced soy sauce. Sambal accompanies virtually every meal in local cuisines.
