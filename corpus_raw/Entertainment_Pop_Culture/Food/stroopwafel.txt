Stroopwafel, (Dutch: “syrup waffle”)  a popular Dutch treat similar to a cookie, featuring two thin wafflelike wafers with a sweet filling. Stroopwafel was first made in Gouda, Netherlands, possibly in the late 18th century. The batter—which is typically made from flour, milk, eggs, butter, brown sugar, and yeast—is rolled into balls and pressed in a waffle iron. Once hot and crisp, the thin waffle is cut in half and spread with a sweet caramel-like stroop (“syrup”), which holds the two sides together. Freshly made stroopwafel is a common street food in the Netherlands, while packaged versions have grown popular around the world.
