roasting,  cooking, primarily of meats but also of corn ears, potatoes, or other vegetables thus prepared, by exposure to dry radiant heat either over an open fire, within a reflecting-surface oven, or in some cases within surrounding hot embers, sand, or stones. The procedure is comparable to the baking of other foods. See baking.
Other examples of roasting include the processing of seeds used to make certain types of foods and beverages. For example, the process of coffee roasting begins with green coffee beans, which themselves have been processed and dried. Temperatures are raised progressively from about 180 to 250 °C (356 to 482 °F) and heated for anywhere from 7 to 20 minutes, depending on the type of roast, light or dark, desired. In cocoa processing, cocoa beans are roasted to develop flavour, reduce acidity and astringency, reduce moisture content, deepen colour, and facilitate shell removal.
