Bubble and squeak,  a common British dish consisting of vegetables, especially potatoes and cabbage. The ingredients are panfried and served as a side dish. Bubble and squeak, which dates from the 18th century, originally also included meat, and it was typically made with leftovers from the Sunday roast and eaten the next day. The contemporary dish, however, is usually meatless, and though a wide assortment of vegetables may be used, the key ingredient is potatoes, which hold the other various components together. The dishâ€™s name supposedly derives from the noises made when the ingredients are fried. Similar dishes, also based on fried vegetables, include colcannon (Ireland) and rumbledethumps (Scotland).
