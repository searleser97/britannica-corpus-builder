Migas,  a Tex-Mex breakfast dish of scrambled eggs cooked with crunchy corn tortilla pieces, cheese, onions, chili peppers, and tomatoes. Migas, which means “crumbs,” is also a traditional dish in Spain and Portugal, though recipes in those countries typically feature bread and various meats instead of tortillas and eggs. The Tex-Mex version is usually served in the United States with refried beans or potatoes and corn or flour tortillas for folding into tacos. Additional ingredients include bacon, chorizo, and other meats. Pico de gallo (fresh salsa) and avocado slices or guacamole can also accompany the dish.
