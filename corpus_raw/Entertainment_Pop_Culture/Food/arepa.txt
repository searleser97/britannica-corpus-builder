arepa,  a flat round cornmeal cake popular in Central and South America, particularly Colombia and Venezuela. Arepas resemble English muffins and are made with various toppings or fillings, including cheese, butter, or meat. The preparation varies widely. In Venezuela they are often grilled or deep-fried and split as a sandwich, while in Colombia—where they are especially popular menu items for street vendors along the Caribbean coast—arepas are deep-fried with egg inside. They are common at breakfast or as an afternoon snack in Colombia, where they are often served with ají, a spicy condiment. Arepas are eaten throughout the day in Venezuela.
