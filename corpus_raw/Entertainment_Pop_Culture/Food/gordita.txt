Gordita,  a small Mexican corn cake that is fried, baked, or grilled and stuffed with various ingredients. A gordita—Spanish for “fat”—is made using masa dough, and the typical fillings include cheese, shredded meats or chicharrón (fried pork rind), mushrooms, potatoes, and refried beans. Gorditas are a common street snack across much of Mexico.
