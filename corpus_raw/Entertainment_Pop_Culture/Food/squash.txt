Squash,  (genus Cucurbita),  genus of flowering plants in the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), many of which are widely cultivated as vegetables and for livestock feed. Squashes are native to the New World, where they were cultivated by native peoples before European settlement. The fruit of edible species is usually served as a cooked vegetable, and the seeds and blossoms may also be cooked and eaten.
Summer squashes, such as zucchini, globe squash, pattypan, and yellow crookneck squash, are quick-growing, small-fruited, nontrailing or bush varieties of Cucurbita pepo. Plants are upright and spreading, 45 to 75 cm (18 to 30 inches) high, and produce a great diversity of fruit forms, from flattened, through oblong, to elongate and crooked fruits, coloured from white through cream to yellow, green, and variegated. Fruit surfaces or contours may be scalloped, smooth, ridged, or warty. The fruits develop very rapidly and must be harvested a few days after they form (before the seeds and rinds harden) and used soon after harvest. The rind is generally considered edible.
Winter squashes are vining, generally large-fruited, long-season plants that are characterized by fruits that can be stored many months (into wintertime) if kept dry and well above freezing. Common winter squashes include the butternut squash (C. moschata), delicata, acorn, and spaghetti squashes (C. pepo), and buttercup squashes and giant pumpkins (C. maxima). The fruits show a wide range of sizes, shapes, and colours; the rinds are relatively harder than those for summer squash and are usually considered inedible.
