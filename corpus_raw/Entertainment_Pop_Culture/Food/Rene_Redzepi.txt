René Redzepi,  (born December 16, 1977, Copenhagen, Denmark), Danish chef recognized internationally for his unique reinterpretation of Scandinavian cuisine; his recipes are characterized by distinctly Nordic locally sourced ingredients.
Redzepi’s father was a Muslim immigrant from the Macedonian region of Yugoslavia who moved to Copenhagen and married a Danish woman. Redzepi later claimed that family visits to his father’s relatives in Yugoslavia triggered his interest in foraging for indigenous edibles. At age 15 he enrolled in culinary school, and then he became an apprentice at a Michelin Guide-starred French restaurant in Copenhagen. He later pursued his training in the kitchens of such Michelin-starred restaurants as Le Jardin des Sens in Montpellier, France, Thomas Keller’s French Laundry in California’s Napa Valley, and Ferran Adrià’s El Bulli in Roses, Spain.
In 2003 Redzepi established a business partnership with Claus Meyer (a Danish entrepreneur and television cooking-show host), and the pair opened the restaurant Noma in a reclaimed 18th-century warehouse overlooking the harbour in Copenhagen’s Christianshavn district. (The restaurant’s name is an amalgamation of the Danish words for “Nordic” and “food.”) The small (12 tables) fixed-price restaurant was starred by Michelin and was ranked among the world’s top eateries by the London-based magazine Restaurant. Redzepi later opened pop-up versions of Noma in various cities, including Tokyo (2015), Sydney (2016), and Tulum, Mexico (2017); they typically operated for about two months.
Redzepi’s cooking was the best example of his broader culinary philosophy based on “time and place.” His Danish book, Noma: nordisk mad (2006), was followed by the English-language Noma: Time and Place in Nordic Cuisine (2010), which helped to spread his influential culinary philosophy. The documentary Noma My Perfect Storm (2015) chronicles Redzepi’s experiences at his famed eatery.
