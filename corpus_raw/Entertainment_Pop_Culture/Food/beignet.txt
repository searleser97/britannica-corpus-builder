Beignet,  French-style fried, square doughnuts. Introduced in Louisiana by the French-Acadians in the 18th century, these light pastries are a delicacy in New Orleans. They were named the official state doughnut of Louisiana in 1986. Beignets are commonly served hot with powdered sugar for breakfast or as a dessert. They are made by deep-frying choux pastry dough, which puffs up when cooked. The word beignet loosely translates to “fritter” in English.
