Lassi,  a creamy, frothy yogurt-based drink, blended with water and various fruits or seasonings (such as salt or sugar), that originated in Punjab, India. There are many varieties, but most are either sweet or salted; the former is blended with curd or fruit (such as mango) or is whisked with sugar, whereas the latter is mixed with salt and/or spices, typically cumin or cardamom. Traditionally, lassi is served in a handleless clay cup called a kulhar, and extra malai (clotted cream) may be spooned on top before serving. The drink has spread to the rest of the world, especially to Great Britain and countries tied to the former British Empire.
