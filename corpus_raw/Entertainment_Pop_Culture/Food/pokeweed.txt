Pokeweed,  (Phytolacca americana), also called pokeberry, poke, or American pokeweed,  strong-smelling plant with a poisonous root resembling that of a horseradish. Pokeweed is native to wet or sandy areas of eastern North America. The berries contain a red dye used to colour wine, candies, cloth, and paper. Mature stalks, which are red or purplish in colour, are, like the roots, poisonous. Leaves and very young shoots—up to about 15 cm (6 inches)—can be edible if properly cooked, though the cooking water should be thrown away.
