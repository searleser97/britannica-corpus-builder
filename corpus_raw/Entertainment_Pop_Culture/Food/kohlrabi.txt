Kohlrabi,  (Brassica oleracea, variety gongylodes),  form of cabbage, of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), grown for its edible enlarged stem. Kohlrabi is best harvested for food when this enlargement is 5–6 cm (2–2.5 inches) in diameter; the flesh is similar to that of the turnip but is sweeter and milder. Kohlrabi is not widely grown commercially but is popular in some regions as a kitchen garden vegetable; in Europe it is also grown for stock feed. The young tender leaves may be eaten as greens, and the thickened stem is usually served as a cooked vegetable.
Kohlrabi is a biennial plant that is usually grown as a cool-season annual. The waxy lobed or wavy leaves emerge from the swollen stem and feature long petioles (leaf stems). The edible stem can be green, white, or purple, depending on the variety. If left to mature, the plant bears yellow four-petaled flowers in small clusters; the elongated fruits are known as siliques.
