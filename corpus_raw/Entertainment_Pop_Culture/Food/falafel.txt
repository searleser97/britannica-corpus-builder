Falafel,  a staple Middle Eastern dish—and a popular street food around the world—that consists of fried spiced balls or patties of ground chickpeas or fava beans (or a mixture of both) stuffed into a pita or wrapped in laffa bread with hot sauce, tahini sauce, and generally some saladlike combination of tomato, lettuce, cucumber, onion, parsley, and yogurt. Falafel may refer either to the balls or patties or to the sandwich. Variations on the dish abound. In Egypt, for example, fava beans are typically used, while Israeli falafel sandwiches are usually made from chickpeas and include more accoutrements.
