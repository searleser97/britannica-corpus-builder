Wintergreen,  any of several evergreen, aromatic plants of the heath family (Ericaceae). Oil of wintergreen, derived from the leaves of Gaultheria procumbens, is a volatile oil used as a flavouring for candies and chewing gum and in the treatment of muscular aches and pains. The active ingredient, methyl salicylate, is also synthesized and sold as oil of wintergreen.
The genus Pyrola includes some 12 species, commonly called shinleaf, native to the North Temperate Zone. They are creeping perennials with leaves that usually grow in a rosette at the base of the stem. Several to numerous flowers are borne in a terminal spike. The calyx (sepals, collectively) is 5-lobed; there are 5 petals and 10 stamens. Common, or lesser, wintergreen (P. minor) has pinkish globular flowers growing in a dense cluster. The pinkish globular flowers of intermediate wintergreen (P. media) grow in a rather elongated cylindrical cluster. The flowers of round-leaved wintergreen (P. americana) are white, with widely spread petals.
Gaultheria procumbens, also called teaberry and checkerberry, has many short erect branches with short-stalked, thick, shining tooth-edged leaves in the upper part. Flowers hang singly from the leaf axils and have a pale pink, waxy-looking, urn-shaped corolla. The bright red berrylike fruits, sometimes called deerberries, consist of the much-enlarged fleshy calyx, which surrounds the small many-seeded capsule. The plant is a native of shady woods on sandy soil, particularly in the mountainous areas of the northern United States and southern Canada; it is hardy in England. Mountain tea, an infusion of wintergreen leaves, has been used in some parts of North America as a beverage.
