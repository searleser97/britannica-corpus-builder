funnel cake,  fried-dough dish popular at fairs, carnivals, and boardwalks and among street vendors. Batter is swirled around into hot oil using a funnel, creating a lattice of deep-fried dough, and then served with heaps of powdered sugar.
The batter used can vary depending on where the funnel cake is cooked, but a popular choice is choux pastry because of its tendency to puff up when cooked. Toppings other than powdered sugar include cinnamon, chocolate, jelly, and fruit.
Funnel cake traces its origins to the Pennsylvania Germans. However, similar dishes date back centuries in the Middle East and Europe and today include strieble in Germany and tippaleipa in Finland.
