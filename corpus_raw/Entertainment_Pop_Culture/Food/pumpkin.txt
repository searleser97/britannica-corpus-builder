Pumpkin,  fruit of certain varieties of squash—such as varieties of Cucurbita pepo, C. moschata, and C. maxima—in the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae), usually characterized by a hard orange rind with distinctive grooves. Pumpkins are commonly grown for human consumption and also for livestock feed. In Europe and South America, pumpkin is mainly served as a vegetable and used interchangeably with other winter squashes. In the United States and Canada, pumpkin pie is a traditional Thanksgiving and Christmas dessert. In some places, pumpkins are used as Halloween decorations known as jack-o’-lanterns, in which the interior of the pumpkin is cleaned out and a light is inserted to shine through a face carved through the wall of the fruit.
Pumpkins, which produce very long annual vines, are planted individually or in twos or threes on little hills about 2.5 to 3 metres (8 to 10 feet) apart. The fruits are generally large, 4–8 kg (9–18 pounds) or more, though some varieties are very small. The largest pumpkins are varieties of C. maxima and may weigh 34 kg (75 pounds) or more; the most massive pumpkins ever grown have exceeded 907 kg (2,000 pounds). Pumpkins are often yellowish to orange in colour, and they vary from oblate to globular to oblong; some feature a white rind. The rind is smooth and usually lightly furrowed or ribbed. The fruit stem is hard and woody, ridged or angled. The fruits mature in early autumn and can be stored for a few months in a dry place well above freezing temperatures.
Some varieties of C. argyrosperma are also known as pumpkins.
