Pecan,  (Carya illinoinensis),  nut and tree of the walnut family (Juglandaceae) native to temperate North America. Rich and distinctive in flavour and texture, the pecan has one of the highest fat contents of any vegetable product and a caloric value close to that of butter. The pecan may be eaten raw, sweetened or salted. It is widely used in pastries, such as coffee cakes, and often in conjunction with chocolate. In the southeastern United States the pecan pie, consisting of pecans baked in a clear custard, and the pecan praline candy are traditional sweets.
The tree occasionally reaches a height of about 50 metres (160 feet) and a trunk diameter of 2 metres (6.6 feet). It has deeply furrowed bark and compound leaves with 9â€“17 finely toothed leaflets, arranged in feather fashion. The male flowers form hanging catkins, and the female flowers are arranged in tight clusters at the ends of the shoots. At maturity the fleshy hulls of the short-clustered fruits dry, split along suture lines, and separate into four approximately equal sections, thus gradually freeing the nuts. The nuts have mottled brown shells varying greatly in thickness; their size varies from 100 to 500 per kg (45 to 225 per pound) and their shape from long and cylindrical with pointed apex to short and roundish.
Native pecan trees occur in the United States (near the Rio Grande in Texas, and in Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, and occasionally Alabama). Its production is the basis of a considerable industry in the southeastern United States. Limited cultivation of grafted varieties had begun in Louisiana by 1847; some important varieties were introduced before 1890. Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi are today the most important producers of grafted pecan nuts. The pecan has been introduced into many countries; it is cultivated to a limited extent in Australia and South Africa.
