Steak frites, (French: “steak [and] fries”)  a simple dish of beef steak alongside strips of deep-fried potato. Its origins trace back to France and Belgium, and it is a mainstay in the cuisine of both countries. The dish can also be found in French-style bistros around the world. Steak frites has many variations—with different types of sauces, cuts of steak, and seasonings—depending on the region. In the past, rump steak was typically used, but contemporary cuts include porterhouse, rib eye, and flank steak. Steak frites can be served with gravy or sauce, including béarnaise, a creamy sauce made from clarified butter, herbs, and egg yolks. The fries can be cut into thick or thin strips and served crispy.
