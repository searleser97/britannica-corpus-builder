Sweetsop,  (Annona squamosa), also called sugar apple or pinha,  small tree or shrub of the custard apple family (Annonaceae). Native to the West Indies and tropical America, sweetsop has been widely introduced to the Eastern Hemisphere tropics. The fruit contains a sweet custardlike pulp, which may be eaten raw.  See also custard apple.
Sweetsop is an evergreen plant with thin oblong ovate leaves. The solitary greenish flowers produce a yellowish green fruit resembling a shortened pinecone. The tuberculate fruit, formed by the fusion of many ripened ovaries and a receptacle, is 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) in diameter. Unlike the closely related soursop (Annona muricata), the sweetsop has fruits with a segmented rind that can separate when fully ripe.
