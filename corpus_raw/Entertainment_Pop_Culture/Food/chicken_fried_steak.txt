Chicken-fried steak,  a battered, pan-fried steak dish popular in the southern United States. The meat—usually tenderized cube steak—is dipped in a milk or egg wash, dredged through seasoned flour, and fried in a skillet. It is served smothered in a creamy gravy, traditionally made with pan drippings. Chicken-fried steak, also called country-fried steak, is commonly believed to have originated in Texas, the product of German and Austrian immigrants who adapted the dish from wiener schnitzel, which is similarly cooked but uses veal and breadcrumbs.
