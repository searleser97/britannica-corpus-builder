Vermouth,   wine-based fortified drink flavoured with aromatic herbs. The name derives from the German Vermut, or “wormwood” (see photograph), a bitter herb and traditional ingredient of vermouth and absinthe. As many as 40 different herbs and flavourings may be used in vermouth, including juniper, cloves, quinine, orange peel, nutmeg, and coriander; the vermouths of various producers are flavoured according to closely guarded recipes.
There are two styles of vermouth: the so-called French, or dry style, which is white, and the Italian, or sweet style, which is darker in colour. Both styles, however, are made in both countries, as well as in the United States. Vermouth is used primarily as an ingredient in mixed drinks or sometimes as an apéritif on its own.
