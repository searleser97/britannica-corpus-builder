Jambalaya,  a savory dish, popularly associated with the U.S. state of Louisiana, consisting of meat (pork, chicken, or even rabbit), seafood (shrimp, crab, crawfish), or both (often including andouille either way) and cooked with vegetables, stock, rice, and various seasonings. While an assortment of vegetables can be used, onions, celery, and bell peppers are considered staples. In Louisiana, for the dish to be Creole style, as it generally is in New Orleans, tomatoes are included; in the Cajun version, common in the state’s southern bayou country, tomatoes are not used.
No one can say with certainty how the dish evolved, other than as a mishmash reflective of the various cultures—African, Spanish, and French—that settled in Louisiana over several centuries. One theory posits that jambalaya was created when Spanish settlers in New Orleans tried to make paella, substituting tomatoes for hard-to-find saffron. It later took on more French characteristics, such as the inclusion of andouille. There are also strong West African associations, specifically with similar one-pot dishes, notably jollof rice.
Jambalaya’s etymology is likewise murky, though some attribute its name to a slurring of the Spanish (jamón) or French (jambon) word for ham with either paella or an African word for rice (variously given as ya, aya, or yaya). Another theory traces the name to the Provençal word jambalaia, which refers to a dish containing rice and various other ingredients.
