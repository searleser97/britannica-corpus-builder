Chocolate pot,   vessel in which hot chocolate is served. It is similar in form and stylistic development to the coffeepot, but it has a hinged or sliding finial covering an aperture through which is introduced a molionet, or stick for stirring and crushing the chocolate.
The earliest surviving chocolate pot dates from 1685 and was made by the English silversmith George Garthorne. The drinking of chocolate in coffee houses was very fashionable during the last quarter of the 17th and the first quarter of the 18th century, but by the middle of the century it had fallen out of favour.
