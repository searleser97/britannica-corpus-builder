Turnip,  (Brassica rapa, variety rapa), also known as white turnip,  hardy biennial plant in the mustard family (Brassicaceae), cultivated for its fleshy roots and tender growing tops. The turnip is thought to have originated in middle and eastern Asia and is grown throughout the temperate zone. Young turnip roots are eaten raw in salads or pickled, and the young leaves may be cooked and served. The roots are also cooked and served whole or mashed and are used in stews. Though sometimes called yellow, or wax, turnips, rutabagas (Brassica napus, variety napobrassica) are a different species.
The turnip root is formed by the thickening of the primary root of the seedling together with the base of the young stem immediately above it. The stem remains short during the first year and bears leaves that form a rosettelike bunch at the top of the root. The leaves are grass-green and bear rough hairs. If left to grow a second season, the bud in the centre of the rosette forms a strong, erect, branched stem bearing somewhat glaucous (having a waxy coating), smooth leaves. Stem and branches end in clusters of small cross-shaped bright yellow flowers, which are succeeded by smooth elongated short-beaked seed pods.
The turnip is a cool-season crop but does not require a long growing season. In mild climates, turnips are sown either in early spring or in late summer and develop rapidly enough to produce a crop before extremes of summer or late fall weather occur. It is sometimes grown as a fodder crop for cattle.
