Brie,  soft-ripened cow’s-milk cheese named for the district in northeastern France in which it is made.
The preliminary soft curd of Brie is molded in flat, pancakelike rounds 9–15 inches (23–38 cm) in diameter and 1–1.5 inches (2.5–3.8 cm) in thickness. After the curd becomes firm, the cheese is sprayed with spores of Penicillium candidum, a mold that forms a thin, downy white crust. The cheese ripens within three to four weeks. The interior is an ivory-coloured paste that has a semisoft, chalky centre when young but becomes soft and creamy throughout when fully ripened. Highly perishable, it remains in this state only briefly; at advanced stages of ripeness ammoniated odours develop, and the cheese begins to dry out and harden.
Brie originated near Paris, where unpasteurized, farm-produced Brie de Meaux and Brie de Melun are the most highly esteemed versions. Most Brie today is made in factories from pasteurized milk, which prolongs the life of the cheese but weakens its flavour. Brie is now widely imitated in many cheese-producing countries.
