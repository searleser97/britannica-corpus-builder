Disznótor,  extravagant feast held to accompany a pig slaughter in Hungary. Many sources suggest that the disznótor is a kind of parody of the halotti tor, the reception following a funeral.
In preparation for the disznótor, the pig is fattened and then is killed early in the morning, typically during the Christmas season but always in the winter. The feast is held that night. During the day, bacon, ham, and sausages are prepared for smoking, and guests are invited to the ensuing feast, which is often followed by music and dancing. The menu usually includes rib soup, various sausages, and black pudding (sausages with cereals added). A special cabbage dish made with meat from the pig’s head is also often served.
