Pannekoek, also spelled pannenkoek, plural pannekoeken or pannenkoeken,  large thin Dutch pancake typically cooked with various sweet or savory fillings, including bacon, cheese, and apples. Those without fillings are often served with such toppings as stroop (Dutch syrup), molasses, treacle (Dutch syrup made from sugar beets), apple butter, or powdered sugar. Pannekoek batter is made with flour, milk, salt, and eggs, and it is poured onto a griddle and spread into a thin plate-size disk, usually thicker than a crepe but thinner than an American pancake. Traditionally, the batter also contains buckwheat flour, though many contemporary recipes omit that ingredient. Pannekoeken are typically served as a main course, for lunch or dinner.
