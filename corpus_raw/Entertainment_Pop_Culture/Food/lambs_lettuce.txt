Lamb’s lettuce,  (Valerianella locusta), also called Lewiston corn salad or mâche,  weedy plant of the family Caprifoliaceae, native to southern Europe but widespread in grainfields in Europe and North America. It has been used locally as a salad green and as an herb with a nutty tangy flavour.
Italian corn salad, Valerianella eriocarpa, thrives in warmer areas. Both plants are hardier than regular lettuce.
