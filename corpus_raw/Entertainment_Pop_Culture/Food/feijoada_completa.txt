feijoada completa,  the national dish of Brazil, consisting of black beans cooked with fresh and smoked meats and accompanied by traditional side dishes. The origin of feijoada completa is uncertain; one idea is that it originated with the cultivation of black beans. It is associated in particular with Rio de Janeiro, where black beans are favoured over red or brown beans, which may be used in other regions.
The modern feijoada completa is an elaborated version of a simple dish of beans flavoured with meat. Most commonly, smoked tongue, corned (salted) spareribs, dried or jerked beef, various types of bacon, sausages, and fresh beef and pork are used. The sliced meats are displayed on a large platter, accompanied by the semiliquid beans, rice, toasted farofa (manioc meal), sliced oranges, sliced onions, cooked cabbage or kale, and a piquant hot-pepper sauce.
