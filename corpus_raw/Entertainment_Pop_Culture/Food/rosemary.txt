rosemary,  (Salvia rosmarinus),  small evergreen plant of the mint family (Lamiaceae), the leaves of which are used to flavour foods. Native to the Mediterranean region, rosemary has naturalized throughout much of Europe and is widely grown in gardens in warm climates. The leaves have a pungent, slightly bitter taste and, dried or fresh, are generally used to season foods, particularly lamb, duck, chicken, sausages, seafood, stuffings, stews, soups, potatoes, tomatoes, turnips, and other vegetables, as well as beverages. The taxonomy of rosemary has been contentious, and it was formerly placed in the genus Rosmarinus as Rosmarinus officinalis. See also Salvia.
Rosemary is a perennial shrub and usually grows to about 1 metre (3.3 feet) in height, though some plants can reach up to 2 metres (6.6 feet) tall. The linear leaves are about 1 cm (0.4 inch) long and somewhat resemble small curved pine needles. They are dark green and shiny above, with a white underside and curled leaf margins. The small bluish flowers are borne in axillary clusters and are attractive to bees. Rosemary is fairly resistant to most pests and plant diseases, though it is susceptible to certain fungal infections, such as powdery mildew, in humid climates. It is also a common host to spittlebugs. The plants are easily grown from cuttings.
In ancient times rosemary was believed to strengthen the memory; in literature and folklore it is an emblem of remembrance and fidelity. Rosemary is slightly stimulating. In traditional medicine it was a popular aromatic constituent of tonics and liniments. Today its fragrant oil is an ingredient in numerous toiletry products and in vermouth. The essential oil content is from 0.3 to 2 percent, and it is obtained by distillation; its principal component is borneol.
