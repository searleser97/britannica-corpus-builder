Medlar,  (genus Mespilus),  either of two species of the genus Mespilus of the rose family (Rosaceae). The common medlar (M. germanica) is a small, much-branched, deciduous, spinous tree known for its edible fruits. The plant is native to Europe, from the Netherlands southward, and to southwestern Asia. The flowers are white or pink-tinged, with five petals, and produce a brown globular fruit with leafy persistent sepals. The fruit is not fit to eat immediately after picking. It must first undergo a process known as bletting (i.e., the flesh turns soft and brown); it then takes on an agreeable acidic and somewhat astringent flavour. Several varieties are cultivated.
Stern’s medlar (M. canescens) was discovered in 1990 in Arkansas, though its taxonomy has been controversial. Stern’s medlar reaches heights of 4.5–6 metres (15–20 feet). It is a deciduous tree or shrub that bears showy white flowers. The fruit is a glossy red pome and is edible if bletted. The species is listed as critically endangered; only about 25 individuals exist in its native habitat.
