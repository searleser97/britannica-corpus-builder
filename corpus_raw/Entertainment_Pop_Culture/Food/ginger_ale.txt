Ginger ale,  a sweetened carbonated beverage of which the predominating flavour and pleasant warmth are derived mainly from the underground stem, or rhizome, of ginger Zingiber officinale. Though originally carbonated by fermentation, modern ginger ales are artificially saturated with carbon dioxide gas. The Jamaican and African varieties of ginger rhizome yield the finest-flavoured beverages, the flavour and pungency of the rhizome being dependent upon the essential oil and oleoresin, which are its principal active constituents.
Other flavouring materials are frequently addedâ€”for example, spices, citrus essences, fruit juices, foam-producing substances, and occasionally peppery materials, such as capsicum, to increase the pungency of the beverage. There are two general types of ginger ale. Pale dry ginger ales tend to be less sweet, more acid, lighter, milder, and highly carbonated. Golden, or aromatic, ginger ales tend to be sweeter, less acid, darker, and generally more pungent.
The Joint Committee of Definitions and Standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1922 defined ginger ale as a carbonated beverage prepared from ginger ale flavour, sugar syrup, harmless organic acid, potable water, and caramel colour. Ginger ale flavour, or ginger ale concentrate, was defined as the flavouring product in which ginger is the essential constituent, with or without the addition of other aromatic and pungent ingredients, citrus oils, and fruit juices.
In preparing a carbonated ginger ale, a syrup is first made, this being compounded from water, sugar, ginger ale flavour or extract, citric or tartaric acid, caramel colour, and possibly foam essence. Such a syrup is then employed in making the carbonated beverage in the manner similar to other soft drinks.
