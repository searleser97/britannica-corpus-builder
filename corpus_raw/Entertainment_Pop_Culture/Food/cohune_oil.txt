Cohune oil, also called cohune-nut oil, cohune also spelled cohoun,  oil obtained from the kernels of the fruits, or nuts, of the cohune palm tree, Attalea cohune. The tree grows in western Central America from the Yucatán Peninsula to Honduras. The oil’s properties, similar to those of coconut oil, have given it increasing importance. Because the nuts are unusually hard and difficult to crack and their collection and transportation present problems, commercial oil recovery has been relatively undeveloped.
The kernels are 65 to 70 percent oil, but they amount to only about 10 percent of the weight of the nut.
