tapa,  a Spanish appetizer, served hot or cold, that is typically eaten at bars with a drink intended to complement the food, much like the French hors d’oeuvres and the Russian zakuski. Tapas have spread worldwide  with the growing popularity of tapas bars. Many of the dishes are quite elaborate and are smaller versions of main-course dishes.
Hundreds of different tapas exist, but some of the more typical ones include shrimp in garlic sauce, marinated anchovies, Spanish omelet (tortilla española), fried spicy potatoes (patatas bravas), and octopus in paprika sauce. Tapas are historically taken with sherry, although beer and wine are now common, and it is a popular custom to go on a chateo, or tour of bars, consuming tapas and drinks at each establishment. Tapas can vary by region in Spain; the northern Basque Country, for instance, has pintxos, which are a similar concept, although pintxos are more often served on top of bread.
