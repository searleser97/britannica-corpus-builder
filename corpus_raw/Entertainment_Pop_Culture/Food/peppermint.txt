Peppermint,  (Mentha Ã—piperita),  strongly aromatic perennial herb of the mint family (Lamiaceae). Peppermint has a strong sweetish odour and a warm pungent taste with a cooling aftertaste. The leaves are typically used fresh as a culinary herb, and the flowers are dried and used to flavour candy, desserts, beverages, salads, and other foods. Its essential oil is also widely used as a flavouring. The plant is a hybrid between watermint (Mentha aquatica) and spearmint (M. spicata) and is cultivated in Europe, Asia, and North America.
Peppermint has square stems, stalked, smooth, dark green leaves, and blunt oblong clusters of pinkish lavender flowers. As with other mints, the plant can spread aggressively by means of stolons (underground stems). Natural hybridization among wild species has yielded many varieties of peppermint, but only two, the black and the white, are recognized by growers. Black peppermint, also called English peppermint or mitcham mint, is extensively grown in the United States and has purplish stems. The white variety is less hardy and less productive, but its oil is considered more delicate in odour and obtains a higher price.
Oil of peppermint, a volatile essential oil distilled with steam from the herb, is widely used for flavouring confectionery, chewing gum, dentifrices, and medicines. Pure oil of peppermint is nearly colourless. It consists principally of menthol and menthone. Menthol, also called mint camphor or peppermint camphor, has long been used medicinally as a soothing balm.
