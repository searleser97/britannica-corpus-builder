Poffertjes,  small Dutch pancakes, traditionally served with powdered sugar and knobs of butter. They are made of a batter that typically includes yeast and buckwheat flour, yielding a light, fluffy texture. The batter is poured over a hot cast-iron pan with shallow half-spherical molds, and then each pancake is individually flipped. In the Netherlands, poffertjes are most commonly peddled, freshly made, at seasonal stands set up at street markets and festivals and in city squares.
