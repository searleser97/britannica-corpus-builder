Calzone,  a half-moon pocket of pizza or bread dough that is stuffed with typical pizza toppings—such as cheese, meat, and vegetables—and often served with marinara sauce. It originated in Naples—calzone means “trouser” in Italian—but has become popular across the globe, with many regional variations. Calzones are usually baked, though some versions are deep-fried.
