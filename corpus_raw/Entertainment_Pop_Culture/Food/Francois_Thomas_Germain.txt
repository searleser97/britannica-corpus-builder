François-Thomas Germain,   (born 1726, Paris, France—died  Jan. 24, 1791, Paris), last of the distinguished Germain family of Parisian silversmiths. He took over the family workshop on the death of his father, Thomas Germain (q.v.), in 1748. At the same time he was granted apartments in the Louvre and was made the royal silversmith. He continued the work of his father of supplying the court with such objects as tableware, chandeliers, inkstands, and altar vessels, all in ornate Rococo style. He also had commissions from the courts of Russia and Portugal.
Unlike his father, he lived extravagantly and was declared bankrupt in 1765. He continued to produce outstanding work until about 1780, when he fell into obscurity.
