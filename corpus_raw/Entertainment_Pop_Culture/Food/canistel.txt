Canistel,  (Pouteria campechiana), also called yellow sapote, or eggfruit,  small tree of the sapodilla family (Sapotaceae), grown for its edible fruits. Canistel is native to Cental America and northern South America and cultivated in other tropical regions. The sweet fruits have orange flesh and are commonly eaten fresh or made into custards or milkshakes.
The canistel tree grows 3–7.5 metres (10–25 feet) tall and has spreading branches and alternate leathery leaves. The small white flowers are fragrant and often borne in small clusters. The canistel fruit is variable in form but roughly oval in shape, 5–12.5 cm (2–5 inches) long, and orange-yellow in colour. The texture of the fruit has been likened to that of the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and the flavour is sweet and musky, sometimes described as being similar to a baked sweet potato. The fruits contain from one to four brown seeds.
