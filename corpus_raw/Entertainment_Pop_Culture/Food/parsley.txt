Parsley,  (Petroselinum crispum),  hardy biennial herb of the family Apiaceae, or Umbelliferae, native to Mediterranean lands. Parsley leaves were used by the ancient Greeks and Romans as a flavouring and garnish for foods. The compound leaves—deep green, tender, and curled or deeply frilled—that develop in a cluster the first season of growth are used fresh or dried, the mildly aromatic flavour being popular in fish, meats, soups, sauces, and salads. Parsley is often the principal ingredient of bouquet garni and fines herbes.
In the second season of growth, seed stalks rise about 1 metre (3.3 feet) tall and are topped by compound umbels of small, greenish yellow flowers followed by tiny fruits, or seeds, similar to those of a carrot but without spines. Parsley seedlings are small and weak; they emerge with difficulty from heavy crusty soils.
Parsley contains less than 0.5 percent essential oil, the principal component of which is a pungent, oily, green liquid called apiol.
Hamburg parsley, or turnip-rooted parsley (Petroselinum crispum, variety tuberosum), is grown for its large white parsniplike root, which is popular in Europe.
