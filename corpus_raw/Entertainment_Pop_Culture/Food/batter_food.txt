batter,  mixture of flour and liquid with other ingredients, such as leavening agents, shortening, sugar, salt, eggs, and various flavourings, used to make baked goods and other food products.
Similar mixtures—called doughs—are thick and flexible, allowing them to be shaped and rolled. Batters, however, contain higher proportions of liquids, are thinner than doughs, and can be stirred, poured, and dropped from a spoon. Baked goods made with batter are mainly shaped by the containers in which they are baked and include biscuits, muffins, scones, corn bread, layer cakes, and angel food cakes. Angel food and sponge cake batters, usually made without leavening ingredients, are leavened during baking by the expansion of the many small air bubbles that have been incorporated into the batter by vigorous mixing or beating. Pancakes too are made with batter. Batters are also used as coatings for foods that are to be sautéed or fried.
