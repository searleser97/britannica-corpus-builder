Licorice,  (Glycyrrhiza glabra), also spelled liquorice,  perennial herb of the pea family (Fabaceae), and the flavouring, confection, and folk medicine made from its roots. Licorice is similar to anise (Pimpinella anisum) in flavour; both plants are somewhat sweet and slightly bitter. The Greek name glykyrrhiza, of which the word licorice is a corruption, means “sweet root.”
Native to southern Europe, licorice is mainly cultivated around the Mediterranean and in parts of the United States. An effective mask for the taste of medicines, licorice is an ingredient in cough lozenges, syrups, and elixirs. It is a flavouring agent in candies and tobacco. The plant is sometimes used in folk medicine to treat peptic ulcers and various other disorders. The roots are ground and then boiled to form a juice; the pliable stick form of licorice candy, also called licorice paste or black sugar, is processed from this thickened juice.
The herb may grow up to 1 metre (3.3 feet) tall and has compound leaves with four to eight oval leaflets. Licorice bears axillary clusters of blue flowers and produces flat pods that are 7 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) long. The roots used are about 1 metre long and about 1 cm (0.4 inch) in diameter. They are soft, fibrous, and flexible and are coloured bright yellow inside. The distinctive sweetness of licorice is imparted by a substance called glycyrrhizin.
