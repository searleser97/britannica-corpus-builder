Cheesesteak, also called Philadelphia cheesesteak or Philly cheesesteak,  a sandwich made with sliced or chopped steak and melted cheese on a long sandwich roll. While its origins are subject to debate, brothers Pat and Harry Olivieri are often credited with coming up with the idea in South Philadelphia in the 1930s. The sandwich soon gained popularity, and it is now found throughout the United States.
Variations exist, but a true Philly cheesesteak’s components rarely change. Steak, usually sliced rib eye or top round, is cooked on a griddle, and cheese is melted on top. Chopped grilled onions and peppers are often added, and the sandwich filling is served in a hoagie roll. Cheez Whiz—a product that Kraft Foods launched in the early 1950s to imitate the sauce used in Welsh rarebit—is the traditional choice for cheese in Philadelphia, but American cheese and provolone are common as well.
