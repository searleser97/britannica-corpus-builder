Lard,   soft, creamy, white solid or semisolid fat with butter-like consistency, obtained by rendering or melting the fatty tissue of hogs. A highly valued cooking and baking fat, lard is blended, frequently after modification by molecular rearrangement or hydrogenation, with other fats and oils to make shortening. Antioxidants are usually added to lard and shortenings to protect against rancidity. Lard is also used in pharmacy and perfumery to make ointments and pomades.
Lard varies with the production method and the fat-bearing animal parts used. Steam- or wet-rendered lard is made by injecting steam under pressure into a closed vessel containing hog fats. Open-kettle-rendered or dry-rendered (enclosed-system) lards, which are darker in colour, are made by melting hog fats in steam-jacketed vessels; the residue is called cracklings. Neutral lard is prepared by melting leaf fat (from around the kidneys) and back fat at about 49째 C (120째 F). Continuous rendering involves grinding, rapid heating, and separation of fat from the cells by centrifuging. Lard composition varies with the diet of the hogs. The predominant fatty acids are oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic.
Lard oil is the clear, colourless oil pressed from pure lard after it has been crystallized, or grained, at 7째 C (45째 F). It is used as a lubricant, in cutting oils, and in soap manufacture. The solid residue, lard stearin, is used in shortenings and as a source of saturated fatty acids.
