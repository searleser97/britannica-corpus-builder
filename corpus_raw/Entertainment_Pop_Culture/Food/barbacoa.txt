Barbacoa, (Spanish: “barbecue”)  a method of cooking meat that originated in Mexico; the term also can refer to the meat itself. Traditionally, lamb or goat is slow roasted for several hours in a pit that is topped with maguey leaves. Some types of barbacoa, however, feature pork or beef, and many modern recipes use a slow cooker. Although the meat can be cooked in its own juices without any seasoning, marinades and spices are often added during the cooking process. Once the meat is very tender, it is typically shredded or chopped before being served with lime in tortillas or alongside a bowl of consommé, a broth made with drippings from the meat. Barbacoa in Mexico is often served with chopped onions, cilantro, and various salsas.
