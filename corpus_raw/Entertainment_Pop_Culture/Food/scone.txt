scone, also called girdle scone,  quick bread of British origin and worldwide fame, made with leavened barley flour or oatmeal that is rolled into a round shape and cut into quarters before baking, traditionally on a griddle. The first scones were baked in cast iron pans hung in the kitchen fires of rural England and Wales. With the advent of Eastern trade, scones became an integral part of the fashionable ritual of “taking tea,” with which they are still served daily, hot and buttered, throughout Britain and many regions of its former empire.
Scones may be enriched by the addition of cream and eggs to the usual mixture of flour, baking soda, sugar, and salt. The dough is kneaded briefly, then rolled and cut to shape, usually triangular, and brushed with the reserved egg white prior to baking. Some recipes call for mashed potatoes. Scones made of baking powder dough sometimes contain currants. These are cut into various rounded, wedge, and diamond shapes and baked in an oven.
