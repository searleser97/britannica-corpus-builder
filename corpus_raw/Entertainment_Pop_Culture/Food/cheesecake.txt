Cheesecake,  a dessert consisting of a thick, creamy filling of cheese, eggs, and sugar over a thinner crust and topped with sweet or sometimes salty items. North American variations of cheesecake, including the type known as New York style, use cream cheese in the filling and a crispy crust made from graham cracker or cookie crumbs. Typical toppings include sour cream, fruit sauces, chocolate or caramel syrup, nuts, whipped cream, or pieces of fruit. Other variations around the world use a coarser, lighter ricotta cheese (as in Italy) or quark, a creamy dairy product common in numerous European countries. Some cheesecake recipes call for baking, but others only require refrigeration. However, even baked versions are usually chilled in order to set the filling.
