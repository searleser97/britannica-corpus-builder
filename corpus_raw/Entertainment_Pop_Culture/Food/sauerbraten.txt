sauerbraten,  in German cuisine, dish of spiced braised beef. A solid cut from the round or rump is marinated for three or four days in red wine and vinegar flavoured with onions, bay leaves, juniper berries, cloves, and peppercorns. After being dried and browned, the beef is braised in the strained marinade. Gingersnap crumbs are often used to thicken the pan juices; in the Rhenish version raisins are also added to the sauce. A buttermilk marinade is sometimes used. Traditional accompaniments to sauerbraten are noodles or potato dumplings.
