Longan,  (Dimocarpus longan), also spelled lungan,  tropical fruit tree of the soapberry family (Sapindaceae), native to Asia and introduced into other warm regions of the world. The edible white-fleshed fruits are somewhat similar to the related lychee and are commonly sold fresh, dried, or canned in syrup. The juicy flesh has a mildly sweet and musky flavour.
The longan tree grows to 9–12 metres (30–40 feet) in height and bears compound leaves with oblong glossy leaflets. The flowers are small and yellowish white and can be staminate (male), pistillate (female), or bisexual. The almost spherical yellowish brown fruits are commonly borne in hanging clusters. The thin leathery skin covers white transluscent pulp that surrounds a single dark seed.
