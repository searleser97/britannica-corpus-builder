Spinach,  (Spinacia oleracea),  hardy leafy annual of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae), used as a vegetable. Widely grown in northern Europe and the United States, spinach is marketed fresh, canned, and frozen. It received considerable impetus as a crop in the 1920s, when attention was first called to its high content of iron and vitamins A and C. Spinach is served as a salad green and as a cooked vegetable.
The edible leaves are arranged in a rosette, from which a seed stalk emerges. The simple leaves are somewhat triangular or ovate and may be flat or puckered. The flowers are inconspicuous and produce small dry fruits. Spinach requires cool weather and deep, rich, well-limed soil to give quick growth and maximum leaf area. Seed can be sown every two weeks from early spring to late summer, in rows 30 cm (12 inches) apart, the plantlets being thinned in the row. The last sowings produce young plants that yield a crop in the autumn and stand over the winter, providing leaves in early spring or even through the winter if the weather is not too severe.
