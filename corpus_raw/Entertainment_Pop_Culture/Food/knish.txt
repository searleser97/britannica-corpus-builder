Knish,  an Eastern European potato snack commonly sold by street vendors in areas with large Jewish populations. These fist-size snacks consist of mashed potatoes wrapped in paper-thin pastry dough and then baked or fried. Other varieties include fillings made from sweet potatoes, mushrooms, spinach, broccoli, cabbage, cheese, or kasha, which is made from buckwheat groats.
