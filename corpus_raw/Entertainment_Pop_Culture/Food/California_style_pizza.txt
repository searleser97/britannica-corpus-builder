California-style pizza,  a thin-crust pizza noted for its fresh, nontraditional toppings, such as chicken, peanut sauce, artichoke hearts, and goat cheese rather than the standard pepperoni and mozzarella. The food item became popular in the early 1980s thanks to several California chefs, notably Ed LaDou and Wolfgang Puck at Spago in Los Angeles and Alice Waters at Chez Panisse in Berkeley. LaDou also worked briefly with California Pizza Kitchen, which developed a restaurant chain based on the dish. Creative and seasonally driven, California-style pizza is reflective of the stateâ€™s bounty of fresh produce, its affinity for culinary innovation, and its enthusiasm for healthy fare.
