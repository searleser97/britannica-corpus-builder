Crumpet,  traditional British teatime treat that is a type of griddle cake, known for its cratered surface. The spongy cakes are traditionally toasted and spread with butter.
Crumpets originated in the 17th century as thin pancakes made from a flour, milk, and egg base. However, todayâ€™s version likely developed in the Victorian era, when bakers added yeast and then baking powder to the recipe. Traditionally, the mixture is poured onto a griddle or baking sheet fitted with special crumpet rings and then baked on one side only, leaving the uncooked moist, spongelike top full of its distinctive nooks and crannies. (American-invented English muffins, on the other hand, are firmer and more breadlike, cooked on both sides, and split before toasting.) Before being served, crumpets are toasted, generously buttered, and often sprinkled with a pinch of salt. They may be topped with a poached egg or a slice of bacon or smeared with honey, jam, or syrup.
