chamomile, also spelled camomile,  any of various daisylike plants of the aster family (Asteraceae). Chamomile tea, used as a tonic and an antiseptic and in many herbal remedies, is made from English, or Roman, chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) or German chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla). Several species are cultivated as garden ornamentals, especially golden marguerite, or yellow chamomile (Cota tinctoria).
Many members of the genus Anthemis, containing more than 100 species of Eurasian herbs, are also known as chamomile. They characteristically have yellow or white ray flowers and yellow disk flowers in compact flower heads. Mayweed, or stinking chamomile (A. cotula), is a strong-smelling weed that has been used in medicines and insecticides.
