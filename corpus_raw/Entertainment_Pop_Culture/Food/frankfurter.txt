frankfurter, also called wiener or in the United States hot dog,  highly seasoned sausage, traditionally of mixed pork and beef. Frankfurters are named for Frankfurt am Main, Germany, the city of their origin, where they were sold and eaten at beer gardens.
Frankfurters were introduced in the United States about 1900 and quickly came to be considered an archetypal American food. The first so-called hot-dog stand, selling the sausages as a sandwich on what was to become the standard long hot-dog bun, was opened at Coney Island, New York, in 1916. The hot dog remained popular in the United States throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries, being especially associated with barbecues, picnics, and athletic events.
Frankfurters are sold ready-cooked and lightly smoked, either loose, vacuum-packed, or canned, to be heated by grilling, steaming, or gentle, brief boiling (frying makes them tough). The German and Austrian frankfurter also is known as a würstchen, or “little sausage,” and many varieties of these sausages exist. In Germany and Austria, frankfurters are eaten warm with sauerkraut and cold, if lightly smoked, with potato salad.
Nutritionally, the typical American frankfurter is about 55 percent water, 28–30 percent fat, and 12–15 percent protein. All-beef or turkey frankfurters are also produced, as are versions with reduced fat content. Most commercially marketed frankfurters contain nitrates or nitrites of sodium or potassium, which prevent the growth of the botulism-causing bacterium, Clostridium botulinum, and preserve the meat’s characteristic reddish colour, which would otherwise be lost in processing.
