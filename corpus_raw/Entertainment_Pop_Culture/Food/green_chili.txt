Green chili,  a staple dish of U.S. Southwestern cuisine that is a spicy stewlike mix of green chiles and usually pork, jalape√±os, onions, tomatoes, and various seasonings. The chili is served in several ways: as a solo dish in a bowl, with flour tortillas on the side, or as a topping for burritos, enchiladas, egg dishes, fries, and more. The green chiles can be canned or roasted, and common varieties include the Hatch chile from New Mexico and those from Pueblo, Colorado.
