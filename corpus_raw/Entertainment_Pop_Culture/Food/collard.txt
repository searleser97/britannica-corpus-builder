Collard,  (Brassica oleracea, variety acephala), original name colewort, also called collard greens,  form of cabbage, of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). The plant is a source of nutritionally important minerals and vitamins A and C. It is commonly raised as a source of winter greens in the southern United States, where it is customarily boiled with a seasoning of pork fat.
Collard bears the same botanical name as kale, from which it differs only in leaf characters: collard leaves are much broader, are not frilled, and resemble those of head cabbage. The main stem reaches a height of 60–120 cm (24–48 inches) with a rosette of leaves at the top. Lower leaves commonly are harvested progressively; the entire young rosette is sometimes harvested. Collard is usually grown as an annual, but it is a biennial plant and will produce yellow four-petaled flowers in loose clusters in its second year. The fruits are dry capsules known as siliques. The plants are susceptible to cabbage loopers and aphids.
