Bacon,  a side of a pig that, after removal of the spare ribs, is cured, either dry or in pickle, and smoked. Some varieties, notably Canadian bacon, are cut from the loin portion of the pork, which is more lean.
Bacon was for centuries the staple meat of the western European peasantry. Varieties distinguished by cut of meat or curing process became standardized in association with particular countries or regions, such as the Irish or various Italian styles. The relatively long storage life of bacon made it the only meat to gain importance as an international trade commodity in the late 19th century.
In the United States in the 20th century, bacon is generally marketed in five standard styles: slab, regular sliced, thin sliced, thick sliced, and ends and pieces. Slab bacon is taken from the side or belly of a hog that has been cured for 10â€“14 days under refrigeration, then cooked and smoked; it contains streaks of lean and fat, and one side is usually covered with skin. Sliced bacon is cut from the slab; it is usually shingled for packaging, with the outer skin removed.
Bacon has an extremely high fat content and is therefore not an especially nutritious meat. By weight, raw American-style bacon contains only about 8.5 percent protein. Also, most bacon, like other commercially cured meats, contains the additive sodium nitrite, the possible carcinogenic properties of which generated controversy in the late 1970s.
Bacon is widely enjoyed for its unique, smoky flavour. It is a favourite with eggs and is used in the preparation or garnishment of a wide variety of dishes.
