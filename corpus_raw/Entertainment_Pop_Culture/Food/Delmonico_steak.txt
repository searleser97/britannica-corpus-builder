Delmonico steak,  a thick steak prepared in a style made famous in the mid-19th century by Delmonico’s Restaurant in New York City, which is cited as the first (1827) official “restaurant” in the United States where one ordered off a menu instead of getting only what was prepared that day. Delmonico style currently refers to rib cuts, but the cuts of meat that the restaurant used for the first Delmonico steaks remain up for debate. Regardless of cut, this steak is traditionally prepared with salt and pepper, basted with butter, broiled to order, and topped with herbed butter, and it was commonly served with “Delmonico potatoes” (a baked and slightly mashed potato dish topped with cheese).
