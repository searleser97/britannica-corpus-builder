Steak and kidney pie,  a traditional British dish consisting of diced steak, onion, and kidney—typically from a lamb or pig—cooked in a brown gravy and then wrapped in a pastry and baked. Mushrooms and bacon are sometimes included, and various ales, notably stout, can be added to the gravy. Steak and kidney pie dates to the 19th century and is counted among Britain’s national dishes. It has several rhyming slang names, including “Kate and Sydney Pie.” The dish is closely related to steak and kidney pudding.
