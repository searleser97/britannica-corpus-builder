Atole, also spelled atol,  a hot Mexican beverage typically made from masa (corn dough) or masa harina (dough flour), water, and spices. Sometimes it is made with oatmeal, rice, barley, or wheat instead of masa. The drink is commonly prepared by toasting the masa on a griddle before mixing in water, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon. Some recipes call for adding fruit or nuts, and a version made with chocolate is known as  champurrado. The consistency can vary from thin and runny to thick like porridge. Atole is often served at breakfast with tamales and is especially popular on the Day of the Dead holiday and during the Christmas season.
