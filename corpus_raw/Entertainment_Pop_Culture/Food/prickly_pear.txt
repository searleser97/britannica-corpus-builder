Prickly pear, also called nopal,  any of several species of flat-stemmed spiny cacti of the genus Opuntia (family Cactaceae) and their edible fruits. Prickly pear cacti are native to the Western Hemisphere. Several are cultivated, especially the Indian fig (O. ficus-indica), which is an important food for many peoples in tropical and subtropical countries.
The Indian fig is bushy to treelike, growing to a height of 5.5 metres (18 feet). It bears large yellow flowers, 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) across, followed by white, yellow, or reddish purple fruits. It is widely grown in warmer areas for the fruit and edible paddles and as a forage crop. The hard seeds are used to produce an oil. Because of their high water content, the stems, especially of spineless varieties, are used as emergency stock feed during drought.
Some prickly pear species are cultivated as ornamentals and are valued for their large flowers. They are easily propagated from stem segments. Two of the best-known species, Engelmann prickly pear (O. engelmannii) and the beaver tail cactus (O. basilaris), commonly occur in the southwestern United States.
Some species have become invasive in regions outside their native ranges. When prickly pears were first introduced to Australia and southern Africa by early explorers, they prospered, and, having left behind their natural parasites and competitors, they eventually became pests. In some cases they have been brought under control by introducing moths of the genus Cactoblastis.
