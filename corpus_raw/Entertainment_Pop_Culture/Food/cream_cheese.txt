Cream cheese,  soft, smooth, unripened cheese made either with cream or with a mixture of milk and cream. It is nearly white in colour and has a mild but rich taste. Cream cheese is similar to cottage cheese but is higher in fat content, cottage cheese being made from skim or nonfat milk. In certain countries, including Canada and the United States, cream cheese is defined as consisting of about one-third milk fat, with a moisture content of 55 percent.
In the United States especially, cream cheese is a popular spread and filling for sandwiches; it is also used in baking, for cheesecake, and is a component of some pastries and frostings.
Cheeses similar in taste and texture to cream cheese include mascarpone, an Italian soft cheese, and Boursin, a creamy cheese that originated in Normandy.
