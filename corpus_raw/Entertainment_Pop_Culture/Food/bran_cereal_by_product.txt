Bran,  the edible broken seed coat, or protective outer layer, of wheat, rye, or other cereal grains, separated from the kernel. In flour processing, the coarse chaff, or bran, is removed from the ground kernels by sifting or bolting in a rotating, meshed, cylindrical frame. The amount of residual bran particles in the flour determines the flour grade.
Wheat bran, the most widely processed, contains 16 percent protein, 11 percent natural fibre, and 50 percent carbohydrate. Most bran is coarsely ground for stock feed. In a more refined form, it is used in breakfast cereal, breads, and muffins for its value to the digestive system as roughage.
The term bran is sometimes used for the coarsely ground by-products obtained during the processing of food for canning (e.g., pineapple bran).
