Angelica,   sweet, fortified dessert wine said to have originated near Los Angeles, for which it is named. Angelica is one of the oldest California wines; it was probably originally made from the mission grape, a European variety brought to California in the 18th century by Spanish padres. Early versions of angelica were occasionally extraordinary; some that survived from the 1870s remained superb more than a century later.
