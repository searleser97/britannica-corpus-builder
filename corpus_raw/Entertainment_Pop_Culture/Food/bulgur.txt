Bulgur, also called bulgur wheat,  cereal food made of wheat groats that have been parboiled, dried, and ground. Commercial bulgur is usually made from durum wheat, though other wheat species can be used. Bulgur has a nutty flavour and can be served as a side dish, similar to rice or couscous, and is often used in baked goods, pilafs, and soups. As a whole-wheat product, bulgur is a good source of dietary fibre, protein, iron, and vitamin B6 and contains gluten.
Wheat was domesticated in the Fertile Crescent in ancient times, and it is thought that bulgur has a similarly ancient history. It is known to have been used in ancient Greece and the ancient Middle East and is mentioned in Old Testament literature. Bulgur remains an important ingredient in Middle Eastern cuisine and is also common in India and the Balkan states. It is the main ingredient in tabbouleh (a salad of bulgur, tomatoes, onions, and herbs) and kibbeh (ground meat patties with onions and spices). Since the early 1900s, bulgur has grown in popularity as a health and gourmet food in the United States and western Europe.
Traditionally, bulgur is prepared by partially boiling whole-wheat groats until they crack, drying them in the sun, then grinding them to various sizes in a stone mill. Industrially prepared bulgur is parboiled, then oven dried and ground and sifted mechanically to precise grades. To cook bulgur, the product is usually boiled, similar to rice or other grains, but it can also be fried, roasted, baked, or simply soaked. Since bulgur is already partially cooked, it takes less time to prepare than other whole grains and has a longer shelf life.
