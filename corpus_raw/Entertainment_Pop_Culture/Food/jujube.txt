Jujube,  either of two species of small spiny trees of the genus Ziziphus (family Rhamnaceae) and their fruit. Jujube fruits are eaten fresh, dried, boiled, stewed, and baked and are used to flavour tea. When made into glacé fruits by boiling in honey and sugar syrup, they resemble Persian dates and are sometimes known as Chinese dates. Juice obtained from the fruits is used in making small candies called jujubes. The raw fruits are high in vitamin C.
Most are varieties of the common jujube (Z. jujuba), native to China, where they have been cultivated for more than 4,000 years. This species, 7.6 to 9 metres (25 to 30 feet) high, has alternate, three-veined, elliptical to ovate leaves 2.5 to 7.6 cm (1 to 3 inches) long. The small yellow flowers are followed by dark brown, round to oblong fruits the size of small plums. The crisp white pulp surrounds a single large pointed stone.
The Indian, or cottony, jujube (Z. mauritiana) differs from the common jujube in having leaves that are woolly beneath instead of smooth. The fruits are smaller and not so sweet.
Both species thrive in hot dry climates where winter temperatures do not go below 9.4 °C (49 °F). The trees are resistant to a great number of pests. Propagation is by seeds, although the commercial varieties must be propagated vegetatively by suckers, root cuttings, or grafting.
Wild jujube (Z. lotus) and Christ’s thorn jujube (Z. spina-christi) are related species, though not commonly cultivated.
