Beaujolais,  one of the most widely drunk red wines in the world, produced in the Beaujolais region of southern Burgundy, France. The wine, made from the Gamay grape, is medium red in colour, with a relatively light body and a fruity, refreshing taste.
Wines from the southern part of the region are simply called Beaujolais. Wines from certain areas in the northern part of the region with the appellation Beaujolais-Villages generally have more colour and body and are considered to be superior in quality. Ten villages in the north produce the best Beaujolais, classified as Grands Crus; notable among them are Moulin-à-Vent and Fleurie.
The popularity of Beaujolais increased rapidly in the latter half of the 20th century. It became fashionable to drink it shortly after harvest; this very young wine is called Beaujolais nouveau. By the early 1990s more than half the production was drunk as nouveau. Beaujolais, and particularly Beaujolais nouveau, is often served chilled.
