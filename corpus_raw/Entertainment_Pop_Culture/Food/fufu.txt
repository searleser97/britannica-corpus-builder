Fufu, also spelled foofoo,  a popular dish in western and central African countries and, due to African migration, in the Caribbean as well. It consists of starchy foods—such as cassava, yams, or plantains—that have been boiled, pounded, and rounded into balls; the pounding process, which typically involves a mortar and pestle, can be laborious. Fufu is often dipped into sauces or eaten with stews of meat, fish, or vegetables. The dish reportedly originated in Ghana, where it is a staple. It is prepared in various ways. In Sierra Leone, for example, fufu is often made with fermented cassava.
