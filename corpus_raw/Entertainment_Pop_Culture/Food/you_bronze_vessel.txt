You, Wade-Giles romanization yu,  type of Chinese bronze container for wine that resembled a bucket with a swing handle and a knobbed lid. It was produced during the Shang (18th–12th century bc) and early Zhou (1111–c. 900 bc) periods.
Related to the hu in profile, the you consisted of a base, usually oval in section, and a broad body, slightly swollen at the centre and tapering to a wide neck. The large loop handle swung from two prominent lugs (ear-shaped protuberances) on either side of the neck. Decoration included a large taotie, or monster mask, on the broad midsection, as well as other motifs characteristic of Shang and Zhou bronze ritual vessels. It was gradually replaced by the hu during the later Zhou dynasty.
