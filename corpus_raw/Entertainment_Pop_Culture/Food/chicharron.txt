Chicharrón,  a dish of fried pork rinds popular in Spain and Central and South America. Recipes for chicharrón vary greatly. Most use pork; others use mutton, beef, or chicken. It consists of meat that has been seasoned, boiled, and deep-fried. Pork belly and rib cuts are common; generally a serving will include some meat, fat, and skin (the latter depends upon culture). Chicharrón is usually served alone as a snack, as the meat portion in soup or stew, with vegetables or salsa, or in tacos.
