Pili nut,   the nut of any tree of the genus Canarium (family Burseraceae), particularly the edible nut of the Philippine tree Canarium ovatum. In the South Pacific the pili nut is a major source of fat and protein in the diet. The densely foliated tropical tree grows to 20 metres (65 feet) in height and produces up to 32 kilograms (70 pounds) of nuts annually. The fruit is 6–7 centimetres (2 1/4–3 inches) long, with a hard, thick-shelled, triangular nut surrounded by a small amount of pulp. The pulp is edible when cooked, but the main food source is the roasted nut, similar in shape and taste to the almond. The uncooked nuts are used as a laxative. The shell is removed by dipping the nut in hot water. Pili nuts are high in fat content and easily digestible. The sweet oil is used in confectionary. Roasted and powdered pili nuts are sometimes used to extend chocolate.
