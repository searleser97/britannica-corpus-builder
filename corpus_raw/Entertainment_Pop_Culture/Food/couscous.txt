couscous,  North African dish of semolina and accompanying foods. Traditionally, the semolina grains (the endosperm of durum wheat) were hand-rolled and prepared in a couscousi√®re, a large covered pot with a lower compartment in which a stew or broth cooks and an upper portion with a pierced bottom in which the couscous steams. The grains would be sprinkled with liquid, stirred to separate the clumps, and steamed several times. While the grain was steaming, a stew of lamb, chicken, chickpeas, and vegetables cooked in the lower portion of the pot. The couscous and stew were eaten with harissa, a fiery sauce of red pepper and other spices.
Today couscous may also be made from cornmeal, ground barley, farina, or pearl millet, with these grains and semolina grains being prepared for cooking by machine, rather than by hand. In addition to its use in savory dishes, couscous can be eaten as a sweet dish with fruits and milk or as a breakfast porridge.
