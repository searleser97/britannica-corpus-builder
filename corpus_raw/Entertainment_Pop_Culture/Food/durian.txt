Durian,  (Durio zibethinus),  tree of the hibiscus, or mallow, family (Malvaceae) and its large edible fruit. The durian is cultivated in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and southern Thailand and is seldom exported. Although the durian has a mild sweet flavour, it also has a pungent odour, which has been compared to that of Limburger cheese; for this reason, the fruit is banned from public transportation in some places. The custardlike pulp can be eaten at various stages of ripeness and is used in a variety of sweet and savory dishes. The seeds may also be eaten if roasted.
The tree has oblong tapering leaves, rounded at the base, and yellowish green flowers borne along the older branches. The fruit is spherical and 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 inches) in diameter. It has a hard external husk, or shell, covered with stout spines and contains five oval compartments, each filled with a cream-coloured pulp in which are embedded one to five chestnut-sized seeds. The ripe fruits are eaten by many animals and are an important part of local ecosystems.
Several other members of the genus Durio produce edible fruits and are locally cultivated. Durian is also related to breadfruit (Artocarpis communis) and jackfruit (A. heterophyllus), which are used similarly throughout tropical Asia and the South Pacific.
