Boza,  a thick, fermented malt drink made from corn, wheat, millet, or bulgur (depending on location), with a subtle tart, tangy taste and a very low alcohol content. Most commonly found in Eastern European and Middle Eastern countries like Turkey, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Romania, boza is a popular winter drink that resembles eggnog. In Turkey, it is slightly sweetened with sugar and cinnamon and served with crunchy roasted chickpeas. The name derives from the Bulgarian drink buzá, which is possibly a root word for the English term “booze.”
