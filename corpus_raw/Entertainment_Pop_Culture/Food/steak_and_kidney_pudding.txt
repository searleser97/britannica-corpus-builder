Steak and kidney pudding,  a traditional British dish consisting of diced steak, onion, and kidney—generally from a lamb or pig—cooked in a brown gravy and then encased in a soft suet pastry and steamed for several hours. Mushrooms and bacon are sometimes added to the meat, and stout or other types of ale may be mixed with the gravy. The first printed recipe reportedly dates to the 1860s, and since then steak and kidney pudding has become one of Britain’s national dishes. It is known by various rhyming slang names, including  “Kate and Sydney Pud.” The dish is closely related to steak and kidney pie.
