Chelsea bun,  traditional British treat that is made from yeast dough topped with currants, brown sugar, and butter and then coiled into square- or round-shaped buns. After baking, they are coated in a sugar glaze. The buns date to the 18th century and were created in the Chelsea area of West London by the Chelsea Bun House (closed 1839), a favourite haunt of the British royal family. The sticky treats are sweet, buttery, and dense, similar to a cinnamon roll. Possibly inspired by the cinnamon roll, some Chelsea bun recipes include cinnamon.
