Wild rice,  (genus Zizania), also called Indian rice, water rice, or water oats,  genus of four species of coarse grasses of the family Poaceae, the grain of which is sometimes grown as a delicacy. Despite their name, the plants are not related to true rice (Oryza sativa). Wild rice grows naturally in shallow freshwater marshes and along the shores of streams and lakes, and the three North American species have long been an important food of Native American peoples. The cultivated varieties of wild rice, annual wild rice (Zizania aquatica) and northern wild rice (Z. palustris), are grown in constructed paddies in Minnesota, Wisconsin, California, and parts of Canada, where the plants are planted and harvested on a large scale by mechanical means. The single Asian species, Manchurian wild rice (Z. latifolia), is cultivated as a vegetable in eastern Asia but is not important as a grain crop.
Wild rice plants are about 1 to 3 metres (3.3 to 10 feet) tall and are topped with a large open flower cluster. While the cultivated North American species are both annual plants, the endangered Texas wild rice (Z. texana) and Manchurian wild rice are perennials. The ripened grains, dark brown to purplish black, are slender rods 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 inch) long. Natural and cultivated stands of the plants provide food and shelter for waterfowl and other birds.
