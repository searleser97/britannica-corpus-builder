Kheer, also called payasam,  a chilled South Asian dessert made from slow-cooked rice, milk, and sugar, much like a rice pudding. It is typically flavoured with saffron, cardamom, raisins, and/or various nuts, notably pistachios, cashews, and almonds. The dish can also be made by using cracked wheat, tapioca, or vermicelli instead of rice. Kheer is particularly popular in India, and it is commonly served at Muslim and Hindu festivals and special occasions. There are numerous regional names for kheer, and in southern India it is sometimes called payasam, which is from the Malayalam word peeyusham, meaning “ambrosia” or “nectar.”
