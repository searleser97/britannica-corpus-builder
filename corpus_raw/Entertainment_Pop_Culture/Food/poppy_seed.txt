Poppy seed,   tiny dried seed of the opium poppy, used as food, food flavouring, and the source of poppy-seed oil. Poppy seeds have no narcotic properties, because the fluid contained in the bud that becomes opium is present only before the seeds are fully formed. The plant, Papaver somniferum, is an herbaceous annual native to Greece and the Orient. Poppy seed is an ancient spice; the seed capsules have been found in Switzerland in the remains of prehistoric lake dwellings.
The seeds are small (about 1 mm [0.04 inch] in length), kidney-shaped, and grayish blue to dark blue in colour. They have a faint nutlike aroma and a mild, nutty taste especially popular in breads and other baked goods. Poppy seed contains from 44 to 50 percent fixed oil, the principal components of which are linoleic and oleic acids.
