shish kebab,  dish of small pieces of lamb threaded on a skewer and cooked over an open fire. The name of the dish is derived from the Turkish şiş, meaning a spit or skewer, and kebab, mutton or lamb. Variants of this dish are found throughout the Balkans, the Middle East, and the Caucasus. In Greece it is called arni souvlakia, in the Caucasus shashlyk.
In many of the versions the lamb is marinated in lemon juice, olive oil, and spices and skewered with onions, bay leaves, and green peppers. It is often served with rice and with grilled vegetables. Lamb livers, tongues, and other entrails, veal, game, pork, and chicken are similarly cooked in the region. Highly seasoned ground meats, such as Bulgarian kebàp, are also cooked on skewers. Chelo kebab, the national dish of Iran, consists of broiled marinated lamb or chicken served with rice that is enriched with butter and raw egg yolk.
