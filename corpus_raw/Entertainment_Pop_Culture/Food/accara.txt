Accara,  black-eyed pea fritters that are a common street food in western Africa. They are usually served with a tomato-and-onion hot sauce called kaani. The fritters are made by combining pureed black-eyed peas, onion, salt, and pepper, separating the mixture into small balls, and then frying them in coconut or vegetable oil. Accara are sometimes presented in a baguette as a sandwich, particularly in Senegal.
