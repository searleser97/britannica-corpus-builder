empanada,  a baked or fried pastry stuffed with any of a variety of fillings, such as meat, cheese, vegetables, fruits, and other ingredients. Empanadas can be found around the world, especially in Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. They are made by folding a sheet of dough over the filling and sealing it before cooking. The origin of the empanada is uncertain. The name, however, comes from the Spanish word empanar, which means “to roll or cover.”
