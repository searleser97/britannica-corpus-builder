Apostle spoon,   spoon for personal use at table, the handle of which is surmounted by a small figure of an apostle, a saint, or Jesus Christ. English silver examples, dating from at least mid-15th century to the end of the 17th century, were sometimes made in sets of 13, consisting of the Twelve Apostles and Christ.
In the 16th and 17th centuries apostle spoons seem to have been popular as christening presents. In the 20th century, silver-plated versions of the spoons were manufactured for use as demitasse spoons.
