Antipasto,  in Italian cuisine, a first course or appetizer. In the home, cured or smoked meats and sausages, olives, salted anchovies, sardines, fresh or pickled vegetables, shellfish, peppers, and cheeses are favoured, while restaurant presentations add to these elaborate prepared dishes such as seafood salads, stuffed mushrooms, vitello tonnato (cold braised veal in tuna mayonnaise), and the like.
Antipasto traditionally was believed to stimulate the appetite before the main meal. Particularly in restaurants, the colour and flavour of the foods in antipasto are important considerations for presentation and for pairing with the meal that follows.
