Baking powder,  leavening agent used in making baked goods. Commercial bakeries and domestic bakers frequently use baking powder, which consists of a mixture of a base (carbonate or bicarbonate) and a weak acid in appropriate amounts. Baking powder also contains added diluents, such as starch, which act as a buffer between the base and acid. The end products of the baking-powder reaction are carbon dioxide and some blandly flavoured harmless salts.
All baking powders meeting basic standards have virtually identical amounts of available carbon dioxide, differing only in reaction time. Most commercial baking powders are of the double-acting type, giving off a small amount of available carbon dioxide during the mixing and makeup stages, then remaining relatively inert until baking raises the batter temperature. This type of action eliminates excessive loss of leavening gas, which may occur in batter left in an unbaked condition for long periods. By comparison, single-acting baking powders, containing tartaric acid or cream of tartar, release carbon dioxide at room temperature, and mixtures in which they are used must be baked immediately to avoid loss of most of the gas.
