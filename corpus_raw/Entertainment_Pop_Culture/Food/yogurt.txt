yogurt, also spelled yoghurt, yourt, or yoghourt,  semifluid fermented milk food having a smooth texture and mildly sour flavour because of its lactic acid content. Yogurt may be made from the milk of cows, sheep, goats, or water buffalo. Cow’s milk is used in the United States and north-central Europe; sheep’s and goat’s milk are preferred in Turkey and southeastern Europe; milk from the water buffalo is most commonly used in Egypt and India. Yogurt may also be produced from nondairy products.
Yogurt may have originated in Turkey, although there are many stories about its discovery. It is made in Turkish homes by boiling milk in an uncovered pan to sterilize it and to evaporate water; after cooling, the milk is inoculated with yogurt from a previous batch, incubated a few hours, then slowly cooled to room temperature before use.
Commercial dairies usually add milk solids to cow’s milk to make yogurt with a custardlike consistency. Concentrated sterilized milk is inoculated with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus; sometimes L. acidophilus or a lactose-fermenting yeast is also added. This inoculated milk is then incubated four or five hours at about 43–44 °C (110–112 °F) until curd forms.
Yogurt is known and consumed in almost all parts of the world. Various flavours and sweetening may be added, or natural yogurt may be mixed with fresh fruits or vegetables. A salad of yogurt, cucumbers, and spices is served in India (raita) and several Middle Eastern countries (jajik). Yogurt is also used in soups and sauces.
