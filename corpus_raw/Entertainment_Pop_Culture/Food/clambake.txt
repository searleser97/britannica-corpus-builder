clambake,  seafood picnic traditional in the New England region of the United States. Early settlers on the Atlantic coast adopted and elaborated the practice from the coastal Indians, who steamed shellfish over hot stones under a covering of seaweed. Clambakes, best undertaken on a large scale, have long been a feature of civic and fraternal celebrations in areas where clams, lobsters, and fish are abundant.
Preparations for a clambake begin with the digging of a deep pit on the beach. The pit is lined with stones upon which a wood fire burns for several hours to heat the stones thoroughly. Clams, lobsters, fish, chickens, ears of sweet corn (maize), whole onions, and potatoes are placed on top of the stones. The food is covered with a thick layer of seaweed, which furnishes the aromatic steam in which the food cooks, and topped with a tarpaulin to hold in the heat. The food is usually eaten outdoors at the site of the clambake.
When the meal is prepared in a large pot, it is described as a clam boil.
