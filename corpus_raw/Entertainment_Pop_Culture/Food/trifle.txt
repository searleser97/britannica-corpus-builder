Trifle,  a common English dessert traditionally consisting of sponge cake soaked in brandy, sherry, or white wine that is layered with custard, fruit, or jam and then topped with whipped cream and slivered almonds or glacé cherries. It is typically served in glass dessert cups, revealing its colourful layers. Recipes for trifles date as far back as the 1590s. Trifles are often made at home, particularly at Christmas. They are light, simple affairs (hence their name). Owing to their alcohol content, they are also sometimes known as “tipsy cakes.”
