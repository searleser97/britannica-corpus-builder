William P. Murphy, in full William Parry Murphy,  (born Feb. 6, 1892, Stoughton, Wis., U.S.—died  Oct. 9, 1987,  Brookline, Mass.), American physician who with George R. Minot in 1926 reported success in the treatment of pernicious anemia with a liver diet. The two men shared the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1934 with George H. Whipple, whose research they had built upon.
Murphy received his M.D. from Harvard University (1920). He joined the staff of Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (later Brigham and Women’s Hospital) in Boston in 1923, where he began his collaboration with Minot. Whipple in the early 1920s had demonstrated that liver in the diet sharply raised red blood cell counts in anemic patients. Acting on this cue, Minot, assisted by Murphy, began feeding liver to their pernicious anemia patients, with amazing results. Their discovery converted pernicious anemia from an often-fatal disease into a treatable disorder and laid the groundwork for the development in 1948 of vitamin B12 therapy.
Murphy continued to serve at the Brigham Hospital and also taught at Harvard University from 1923. He retired in 1958. His textbook Anemia in Practice was published in 1939.
