borscht, also spelled borsch, borsht, or bortsch,  beet soup of the Slavic countries. Although borscht is important in Russian and Polish cuisines, Ukraine is frequently cited as its place of origin. Its name is thought to be derived from the Slavic word for the cow parsnip, or common hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium), or from a fermented beverage derived from that plant. The more-palatable cultivated beet eventually replaced the wild cow parsnip as the basis of the soup.
Borschts are eaten hot or cold. Some are clear and light, others thick and substantial. Many recipes counterbalance the sweetness of the beets with the addition of kvass (also spelled kvas). The term kvass may refer to a sour, slightly alcoholic beer made from bread or to a concoction of fermented beets; both are used. Vinegar, lemon juice, or citric acid can be added to achieve a similar effect.
Ukrainian borscht is a hearty soup of beef and a variety of vegetables in which root vegetables and cabbage predominate, and the soup takes its characteristic deep red colour from beets. The soup is often eaten with a sour cream garnish and with pirozhki, turnovers filled with beef and onions. A meatless beet soup is made with a stock flavoured with forest mushrooms; this Polish version is served with tiny mushroom-filled dumplings, uszka.
