Sazerac,  a variation of a cognac cocktail native to New Orleans. Named for the French cognac Sazerac de Forge et Fils, this drink is made by mixing rye whiskey or bourbon with simple syrup and Peychaudâ€™s Bitters in a glass coated with Herbsaint, a local anise-flavored liquor and one-time absinthe substitute. It is commonly served with a lemon twist. The bitters give the drink a bright pink hue. The cocktail was invented in the 1800s, though its exact origins are unknown.
