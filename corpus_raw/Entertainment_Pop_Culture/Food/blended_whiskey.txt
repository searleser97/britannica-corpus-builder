Blended whiskey,  mixture of straight whiskey (that distilled from mash of a single grain) and mixed-grain whiskey or neutral spirits. Blended straight whiskey is a mixture of straight whiskeys only. Whiskeys are blended in order to achieve a uniform product with a balanced character and, generally, a lighter, somewhat less pronounced taste than that of straight whiskey. See whiskey.
