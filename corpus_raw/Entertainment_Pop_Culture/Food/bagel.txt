Bagel,  doughnut-shaped yeast-leavened roll that is characterized by a crisp, shiny crust and a dense interior. Long regarded as a Jewish specialty item, the bagel is commonly eaten as a breakfast food or snack, often with toppings such as cream cheese and lox (smoked salmon).
Bagels are made from the basic bread ingredients of flour, yeast, salt, and sweetening. High-gluten flour gives the roll its spongy, chewy texture, which can be lightened by the addition of eggs, milk, and butter. As traditionally made, the dough is shaped by hand into a ring, boiled for a short time in water to seal the dough to ensure a compact texture, and then baked. In modern mass production, the rings are machine-made, and steaming may be substituted for boiling. In either process, a glaze of egg yolk or milk applied before baking produces a shiny crust. Seeds and spices may be added before baking; bagels also are made with flavourings, vegetables, nuts, or fruits mixed into the dough. There are also whole-grain and rye versions.
The origin of the bagel is not known, but it seems to have its roots in central Europe. Accounts from the royal court in Poland dating to the 14th century mention obwarzanek, a ring-shaped, boiled, bagel-like bread. A widely repeated legend traces the origin of the bagel itself to Vienna in 1683, when John III Sobieski, king of Poland, successfully defended the city from a Turkish invasion. A local baker, wishing to commemorate the victory of this accomplished horseman, fashioned his bread in the shape of a stirrup (the present-day German word for which is BÃ¼gel). In the late 19th century, European Jewish immigrants introduced the bagel to the United States, where it gained a popular association with New York City. The American bagel industry expanded rapidly in the late 20th century; bagel bakeries and frozen-food distributors created numerous variations on the traditional form and texture.
