Tortellini,  a ring-shaped Italian pasta stuffed with cheese or meat that is most traditionally served in broth (en brodo), though other sauces—including those made from tomato, mushroom, or meat—are also popular. Tortellini originates from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, and it is particularly associated with Bologna. The meat and cheese used in the pasta can vary, with common fillings being prosciutto and Parmesan or ricotta cheeses. Tortelloni, a larger version of the pasta, is typically stuffed with cheese and greens (such as spinach) and served with a butter or meat sauce.
