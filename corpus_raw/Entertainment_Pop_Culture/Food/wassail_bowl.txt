Wassail bowl,   vessel generally made of wood and often mounted in silver, used on ceremonial occasions for drinking toasts. The word wassail derives from Old Norse ves heill, meaning “be well, and in good health.” The name has come to be generally applied to any bowl from which a toast is drunk, as well as to the actual drink itself.
