Tapioca,  a preparation of cassava root starch used as a food, in bread or as a thickening agent in liquid foods, notably puddings but also soups and juicy pies.
In processing, heat ruptures the starch grains, converting them to small irregular masses that are further baked into flake tapioca. A pellet form, known as pearl tapioca, is made by forcing the moist starch through sieves. Granulated tapioca, marketed in various-sized grains and sometimes called “manioca,” is produced by grinding flake tapioca. When cooked, tapioca swells into a pale, translucent jelly.
The cassava plant, or manioc, is native to the West Indies and to South America, where its roots are ground into meal and then baked into thin cakes. Tapioca became a common Asian food after the cassava was introduced into that part of the world during the 19th century. In Thailand a pudding is made of tapioca and coconut, and tapioca paste is rolled into balls and dried to be eaten as cereal. The Vietnamese make a kind of thin pancake using tapioca starch. Beverages with tapioca are popular in many parts of Asia.
