Whey,  watery fraction that forms along with curd when milk coagulates. It contains the water-soluble constituents of milk and is essentially a 5 percent solution of lactose in water, with some minerals and lactalbumin.
The whey is removed from the curd during the process of making cheese. Then it is centrifuged to remove fat, concentrated or dried, and used for food in processed cheese products, baking, and candy making. Whey is used for animal feed as a liquid, concentrate, or dry powder.
