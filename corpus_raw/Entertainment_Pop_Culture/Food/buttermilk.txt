Buttermilk,  the fluid remaining when the fat is removed by churning cream into butter. It was formerly used as a beverage, but today it is mostly condensed or dried for use in the baking and frozen desserts industry. It has been replaced as a beverage by cultured buttermilk, which is prepared from skim or low-fat milk by fermentation with bacteria that produces lactic acid. The resulting product is thicker than traditional buttermilk but is similar to it in other respects.
Cultured buttermilk, like skim milk, consists mainly of water (about 90 percent), the milk sugar lactose (about 5 percent), and the protein casein (about 3 percent). Buttermilk made from low-fat milk contains small quantities (up to 2 percent) of butterfat.
Buttermilk is made by heating skim or low-fat milk to 88 °C (180 to 190 °F) for 30 minutes or 90 °C (195 °F) for two to three minutes. This heating process is done to destroy all naturally occurring bacteria and to denature the protein in order to minimize wheying off (separation of liquid from solids). The milk is then cooled to 22 °C (72 °F), and starter cultures of desirable bacteria, such as Streptococcus lactis, S. cremoris, Leuconostoc citrovorum, and L. dextranicum, are added. These organisms convert lactose into lactic acid, a process that develops buttermilk’s acidity and unique sour flavour; the different types of bacteria may be used singly or in combination to obtain the desired flavour. The addition of these bacteria makes buttermilk easier to digest by lactose-intolerant consumers. The high numbers of live bacteria organisms are thought to provide other healthful and digestive benefits.
The ripening process takes about 12 to 14 hours (overnight). At the correct stage of acid and flavour, the product is gently stirred to break the curd, and it is cooled to 7.2 °C (45 °F) in order to halt fermentation. It is then packaged and refrigerated.
