Trivet,   stand or support for utensils before or on the fire. Usually made of wrought iron, the most common variety, from the 17th century, stands on three legs and has a circular plate with perforated decoration, often in the form of a date. Another early type, short-legged, stood in the fire to support a cast-iron pot. Later, in the second half of the 18th century, trivets designed to be hung from fire bars were made. These were of two types: an oblong, standing trivet with a handle at one end and projections to fit over the fire bars at the other, and a plate that could be attached to the fire bar. Some of the latter were hung inside the grate supporting a vessel over the fire.
Large quantities of cast-brass fender trivets were manufactured at Birmingham, in England, in the last quarter of the 18th century; these were suspended from the top rails of the fender as muffin and kettle stands. Four-legged trivets that stood under the spit holding the dripping pan were made in the 18th and 19th centuries. The cat, an entirely different type of plate stand that was made in the 18th century, consisted of six spokes, three at the top and three at the bottom; it could be used either way up.
The term trivet is also used in reference to a metal stand with short feet, used on a table to support a hot dish.
