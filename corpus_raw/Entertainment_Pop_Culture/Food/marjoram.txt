marjoram,  (Origanum majorana), also called sweet marjoram,  perennial plant of the mint family (Lamiaceae), grown as a culinary herb. Its fresh or dried leaves and flowering tops are used to season many foods, imparting a warm, aromatic, slightly sharp, and bitterish flavour. Marjoram is particularly appreciated for the taste it lends to sausages, meats, poultry, stuffings, fish, stews, eggs, vegetables, and salads. Native to the Mediterranean region and western Asia, marjoram is also cultivated as an annual in northerly climates where winter temperatures kill the plant.
Marjoram is a bushy herbaceous plant that typically reaches 30–60 cm (1–2 feet) in height. The square branching stems are densely covered with hairy ovate leaves, arranged oppositely in pairs. The pale two-lipped flowers are not particularly showy and are borne in small spikelike clusters. Marjoram contains about 2 percent essential oil, the principal components of which are terpinene and terpineol.
Various other aromatic herbs or undershrubs of the genus Origanum are called marjoram. Pot marjoram (O. onites) is also cultivated for its aromatic leaves and is used to flavour food. Oregano, or wild marjoram (O. vulgare), is a popular culinary herb native to Europe and Asia.
