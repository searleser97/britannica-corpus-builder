Sponge candy,  a crunchy, bite-size, chocolate-covered crystalline candy. Much like malt balls, it has a crispy inner texture that melts away quickly when eaten. The sweet filling usually tastes of caramelized sugar or molasses, while the covering is typically milk chocolate or dark chocolate. The candy is sometimes orange-flavoured. It is widely associated with Buffalo, New York, where sponge candy is popularly made, sold, and distributed.
