Cress,  any of several plants of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), of interest for their piquant young basal leaves, which may be used in salads or as seasonings and garnishes. Watercress (Nasturtium officinale), perhaps the most popular of the edible cresses, is a hardy creeping perennial plant, native to Europe but extensively naturalized elsewhere in streams, pools, and ditches. Fresh watercress is used as a salad green and sandwich filling. Common garden cress, or peppergrass (Lepidium sativum), a fast-growing, often weedy native of western Asia, is widely grown, especially in its curl-leaved form, and the seedlings are used as a garnish.
Upland cress (Barbarea verna), a hardy biennial native to Europe, is a coarse, often weedy plant rarely cultivated. The closely related winter cress, or yellow rocket (B. vulgaris), is a common weed, conspicuous in fields for its bright yellow spring flowers. Bitter cress, cuckoo flower, or meadow cress (Cardamine pratensis), of the Northern Hemisphere, grows in damp meadows and in bog gardens. It is low-growing, with pinnately divided leaves and small white to rose flowers. Yellow cress (Rorippa species) includes several marshy plants little cultivated. Pennycress (Thlaspi species) includes a few species grown in rock gardens and one (T. arvense) grown for its large, round ornamental seed pods. The plants known as rock cress (Arabis species) are useful ornamentals grown in gardens for their small but numerous white, yellow, pink, or purplish flowers. Cress seedlings, as used in sandwiches and salads, come from white mustard (Brassica hirta or Sinapis alba).
