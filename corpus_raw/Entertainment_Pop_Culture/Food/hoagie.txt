Hoagie,  a submarine sandwich filled with Italian meats, cheeses, and other toppings. The name likely comes from the Philadelphia area where, during World War I, Italian immigrants who worked at the Hog Island shipyard began making sandwiches; they were originally called “hoggies” before the name hoagie took hold. Hoagies are similar to the sandwiches known as subs, heroes, and grinders that are common elsewhere around the Northeast United States.
