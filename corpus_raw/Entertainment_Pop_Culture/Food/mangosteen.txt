Mangosteen,  (Garcinia mangostana), also called purple mangosteen,  handsome tropical tree (family Clusiaceae) native to Southeast Asia and cultivated for its tart-sweet fruit. The mangosteen fruit is highly valued for its juicy, delicate texture and slightly astringent flavour and is commonly eaten fresh, canned, or dried. The plant is used locally in traditional medicine and has been promoted as an alternative cancer treatment, but clinical studies in humans are lacking.
Under favourable conditions, the slow-growing mangosteen tree can reach a height of 9.5 metres (31 feet). It has thick, dark green, glossy leaves, 15–25 cm (6–10 inches) long, borne in opposite pairs along the stem, and large rose-pink flowers. The fruits are the size of a small orange, round or flattened on the ends. Mangosteens have a thick, hard, deep red rind surrounding snow-white flesh, which is in segments resembling those of a mandarin orange. Seedlings take 8 to 15 years to bear fruit. Individual trees have been reported to yield more than 1,000 fruits in a season, but the plants usually produce good crops only in alternate years.
The mangosteen has been cultivated in Java, Sumatra, Indochina, and the southern Philippines from antiquity. It is a common dooryard tree in Indonesia. The mangosteen was fruited in English greenhouses in 1855, and subsequently its culture was introduced into the Western Hemisphere, where it became established in several of the West Indian islands, notably Jamaica. It was later established on the mainland in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Ecuador. It can also be grown in southern Florida. The mangosteen generally does not prosper outside the tropics and is usually found fresh only in local markets. Importation of the fruit was illegal in the United States until 2007 over fears of introducing the Asian fruit fly; imported mangosteens must first be irradiated to eliminate the pest.
