Maf√©, also spelled maafe,  a West African dish consisting of meat in a peanut or peanut butter sauce served over rice or couscous. It originated in Mali and spread across the region, particularly in Senegal and the Gambia, during the colonial period, when efforts were undertaken to increase production of groundnuts. Some versions of the dish resemble a stew and contain such ingredients as tomato, onion, garlic, cabbage, peppers, and spices. Other variations consist simply of meat and a generous serving of rich, thick peanut sauce. Beef and lamb are most commonly used, but chicken and fish are featured in some recipes.
