Mamey apple,  (Mammea americana), also called mammee apple or Santo Domingo apricot,  large tree and its edible fruit (family Calophyllaceae), native to the West Indies and tropical America. The fruit is eaten raw and used for preserves. An aromatic liqueur distilled from the flowers is called eau de Créole. The acrid resinous gum has been used locally for destroying skin-infesting chigoe fleas, and the bitter resinous seeds are used as an antiworming agent.
The mamey apple tree has opposite, leathery, gland-dotted leaves and white, sweet-scented, solitary or clustered axillary flowers. Its fruit is yellow or russet in colour and grows 7–15 cm (3–6 inches) in diameter. The bitter rind encloses a sweet aromatic flesh with one to four large rough seeds.
Sapote, also known as mamey sapote or red mamey (Pouteria sapota), is an unrelated fruit also found throughout Latin America.
