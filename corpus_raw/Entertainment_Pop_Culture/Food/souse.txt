Souse,  a light Caribbean dish, served cold, that traditionally consists of pickled pig meat in a clear broth flavoured with various seasonings. Regional variations exist; in some countries souse resembles a soup, while in others it is more ceviche-like. Souse features meat from various parts of the pig, including the feet, the head, the ears, and the tail. However, various parts from cows and chickens can also be used. To tenderize the fatty meat, it is cooked in water before being marinated in lime, peppers, onions, cucumbers, garlic, and other seasonings so that it becomes pickled. The dish is popular on many Caribbean islands, including Trinidad and Antigua, and is enjoyed particularly on weekends and at Christmas.
