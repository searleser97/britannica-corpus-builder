Lager beer,  light-coloured, highly carbonated type of beer. The term lager is used to denote beer produced from bottom-fermenting yeast. Lagers are distinguished from ales, or top-fermented British types of beer.
Bottom-fermented lagers have their origins in continental Europe. In 1420 beer was made in Germany by a bottom-fermentation process, so called because the yeast tended to sink to the bottom of the brewing vessel; before that, the type of yeast used tended to rise to the top of the fermenting product and was allowed to overflow or was manually skimmed. Brewing was a winter occupation, and ice was used to keep beer cool during the summer months. Such beer came to be called lager (from German lagern, “to store”). The development of refrigeration equipment in the late 19th century enabled lager beers to be brewed in summer.
