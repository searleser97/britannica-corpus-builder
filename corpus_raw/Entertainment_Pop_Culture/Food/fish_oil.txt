Fish oil,  fatty oil from the bodies of fishes, used in the manufacture of many products, such as margarine, cooking oil, cosmetics, caulking compounds, paints, industrial coatings, lubricants, water repellents, soaps, and candles. It is also used in the tanning of leather, the manufacture of rubber, and the production of chemicals used for making synthetic wax. Anchovy, menhaden, herring, and pilchard are the chief sources of fish oil.
Oil and water are pressed from cooked fish during the manufacture of fish meal and are separated by centrifuge. The oil is further purified by centrifuge before storage.
Fish oils are high in unsaturated lipids. Fish-liver oils (such as cod-liver oil) were once an important source of vitamins A and D, which are now produced synthetically at lower cost.
