sticky toffee pudding,  a classic British dessert consisting of a dark, dense sponge cake made with chopped dates that is topped with a sweet toffee sauce; it may also be served with vanilla ice cream or custard. Although its origins are unclear, it was likely invented during the 20th century in the Lake District of northwest England, from where its popularity spread across the country.
