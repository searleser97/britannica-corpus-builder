caramel,  candy substance obtained by boiling sugar to or beyond approximately 240 °F (115 °C), at which point its mass takes on a slightly yellowish colour and pleasantly burnt smell.
Caramels vary in consistency between the short, or soft, and the long, or more chewy, types depending upon the proportions of ingredients. Corn syrup added to the basic sugar constituent controls graining and contributes body. Milk, essential to the traditional “carmel candy” flavour, imparts a creamy, collapsible consistency. The blended ingredients, including fats and starches, are stirred continuously during cooking and then poured into vessels or over cooling slabs in preparation for cutting and wrapping.
Although the making of cream caramels requires a high degree of skill, caramel is a basic candy that is more important to mass-producers of sweets than to the individual confectioner. Various grains of caramel may be dipped, coated, or coloured and flavoured with fruit and nuts as well as coffee. Apples coated with caramel and skewered on sticks are a popular form of the candy in the United States.
