Venison,   (from Latin venatus, “to hunt”), the meat from any kind of deer; originally, the term referred to any kind of edible game.
Venison resembles beef and mutton in texture, colour, and other general characteristics. It has virtually the same chemical composition as beef but is less fatty. Lean venison roast, before cooking, contains by weight approximately 75 percent water, 20 percent protein, and 2 percent fat; this protein content is about the same as that of a lean beef rump.
Like most game, deer after being killed should be drained of blood and allowed to cool. Venison may be eaten fresh, but it is generally hung in a cool place for three to five days, and often for six to ten days or more, for aging, or ripening. Aging enhances the tenderness and the palatability of the meat, particularly in older deer. The legs, saddle, loin, and tenderloin are butchered for steaks, chops, or cutlets, which are best cooked only briefly and can be served with a number of sauces and garnishes; the less-desirable parts of the animal, such as the shoulder, shank, and breast, are usually well marinated and are excellent for use in stews.
