tofu, also called bean curd,  soft, relatively flavourless food product made from soybeans. Tofu is an important source of protein in the cuisines of China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. It is believed to date from the Han dynasty (206 bce–220 ce).
Tofu is made from dried soybeans that are soaked in water, crushed, and boiled. The mixture is separated into solid pulp (okara) and soy “milk.” Salt coagulants, such as calcium and magnesium chlorides and sulfates, are added to the soy milk to separate the curds from the whey. In some cases, acid coagulants, such as citric acid or glucono delta-lactone, may be used. The soy milk is poured into molds to allow the carbohydrate-laden whey to drain off. The resultant soft cakes are cut into squares and stored under water until sold, in bulk or in individual water-filled tubs. Tofu can be made extra soft, soft (silken), firm, or extra firm, depending on the method of production. Dried tofu, which does not require refrigeration, is also sold.
Tofu is 6–8 percent protein and is high in calcium, potassium, and iron. Okara and soy whey, the by-products of tofu manufacture, are also eaten. The skin that forms on top of the soy milk as it stands is removed and dried in sheets for use in vegetarian dishes. Tofu may be flavoured, such as with ginger or onion, or seasoned with spices. It may be grilled, deep-fried, simmered, stir-fried, steamed, or eaten fresh and may be served with toppings such as tapioca or sweet syrups. In China, fermented bean curd is popular. Chinese tofu usually has a somewhat firmer texture and a more-pronounced taste than that favoured in Japan.
