Grapefruit,  (Citrus ×paradisi), also called pomelo,  citrus tree of the Rutaceae family and its edible fruit. The grapefruit probably originated in Barbados as a hybrid of shaddock (Citrus grandis). It became well established as a fruit for home consumption in the islands of the West Indies before its culture spread to the American mainland. Grapefruit has become popular as breakfast fruit in various parts of the world, and production has expanded to most citrus-growing countries, notably the United States, Israel, Cyprus, South Africa, and Brazil. As a source of vitamin C, the grapefruit is exceeded among common fruits only by the orange and lemon.
The grapefruit tree grows to be as large and vigorous as an orange tree; a mature tree may be from 4.5 to 6 metres (15 to 20 feet) high. The foliage is very dense, with leaves dark and shiny green and nearly glabrous (without plant hairs). Flowers are large and white, borne singly or in clusters in the axils of the leaves. Most varieties are yellow when ripe. The fruit ranges from 100 to 150 mm (4 to 6 inches) in diameter, its size depending upon the variety and upon growing conditions. Its pulp is usually light yellowish, tender, and very full of juice, with a distinctive mildly acid flavour. Several varieties have pink or red pulp.
Grapefruit trees produce the best quality fruit on sandy, relatively fertile soils. Supplementary fertilization is necessary in practically all producing areas. The trees come into bearing early and may be expected to produce commercially profitable crops by the fourth to sixth year after being planted in the orchard. Mature trees may produce remarkably large crops—585 to 675 kg (1,290 to 1,490 pounds) of fruit per tree.
