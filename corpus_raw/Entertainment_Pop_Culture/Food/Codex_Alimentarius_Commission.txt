Codex Alimentarius Commission,   joint commission of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) established in 1963 to develop an international code of food quality standards. In its first 20 years of activity, the commission compiled hundreds of definitions of foodstuffs and additives, restrictions on food composition including limits on residual pesticides, and requirements for labeling; many of these provisions were adopted as legally binding by the more than 120 member nations. In the late 1970s committees were established under the auspices of the commission to coordinate food quality monitoring and control thoughout the less-developed nations.
