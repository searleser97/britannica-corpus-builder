ketchup, also spelled catsup or catchup,  seasoned pureed condiment widely used in the United States and Great Britain. The origin of the word ketchup is not entirely clear; the word likely derives from the Chinese ke-tsiap, a fish brine, probably by way of the Malaysian ketjap.
American ketchup is a sweet puree of tomatoes, onions, and green peppers flavoured with vinegar and pickling spice that is eaten with meats, especially beef, and frequently with french-fried potatoes (British chips). It is the universal condiment of many types of fast-food meals.
In Britain, as formerly in the United States, ketchup is a puree based on mushrooms, unripe walnuts, or oysters. This ketchup functions primarily as a seasoning for cooking.
