Sea moss drink,  a Caribbean beverage made from dried sea moss (a type of seaweed), milk, and various sweeteners. In most recipes, the sea moss is soaked in lime juice overnight and then boiled in water, often with a cinnamon stick, until becoming jellylike. After cooling, it is then blended with milk and such sweeteners as nutmeg, sugar, or vanilla. Sea moss drinks are popular throughout the islands of the Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica and Trinidad, and they are often believed to improve virility.
