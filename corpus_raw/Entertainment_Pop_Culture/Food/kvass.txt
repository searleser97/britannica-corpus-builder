Kvass, (Russian: “leaven”)  one of the most popular alcoholic drinks in Russia from the 16th until the 19th century. It has since lost much of its popularity, and little is now commercially produced.
Kvass is similar to rye beer. Different qualities used to be made, and it was primarily a drink associated with the Russian peasantry. In some places its manufacture was commercial, but in general it was (and is) made in individual households. The exact method varies with local or private custom, although rye bread fermented with malt is the base. Mint is frequently added for flavouring, or sometimes fruit, such as apples or raspberries.
On a hot summer day, chilled kvass was used to make okroshka, a traditional cold soup laced with cucumbers, boiled eggs, sausages, and salamis. In Slavic countries, kvass may be added to borscht recipes to counterbalance the sweetness of the beets.
