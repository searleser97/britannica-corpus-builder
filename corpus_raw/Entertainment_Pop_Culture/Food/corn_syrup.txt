Corn syrup,  a viscous sweet syrup produced by breaking down (hydrolyzing) cornstarch, either by heating it with a dilute acid or by combining it with enzymes. (Cornstarch is a product of corn [maize].) Corn syrup is sometimes also called glucose syrup, which is also made from the hydrolysis of starch but not necessarily cornstarch; wheat, potatoes, rice, and other plants can serve as starch sources.
Corn syrup is sold commercially as either light or dark corn syrup. Light corn syrup has been clarified and decolorized; it is used in baked goods, jams and jellies, and many other food products. Because it does not crystallize when heated, it is particularly valued as an ingredient in candies. Dark corn syrup is made by combining corn syrup with molasses and caramel colouring and is sweeter than light corn syrup. Dark corn syrup is used in the same ways as light but when a darker colour and more distinctive flavour are desired; it is also used as a table syrup.
Corn syrup is used in the production of high-fructose corn syrup, in which glucose is changed to fructose through the addition of an enzyme called d-xylose isomerase. High-fructose corn syrup is widely used in the food industry, notably in the manufacture of soft drinks, because it is considerably cheaper than sucrose.
