Tamale, Spanish tamal, plural tamales,  in Mesoamerican cuisine, a small steamed cake of dough made from corn (maize). In the preparation of tamales, masa harina, fine-ground corn treated with slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), is made into a thick paste. For each tamale, the masa is spread on a corn husk, a small amount of filling is added, and the whole is wrapped into a package and tied with a strip of husk. The tamales are steamed until cooked through.
There are dozens of local variations in the dough and filling for tamales. Banana leaves form the wrappers on the Gulf Coast and in the Yucatán. The uchepos of Morelia and tamales dulces of Jalisco employ fresh rather than dried corn. Fillings may contain meat, cheese, chilis, herbs, fish, or vegetables in savoury or sweet combinations; some tamales are even cooked “blind,” with no filling.
Tamales were known from antiquity in Mexico. Several varieties were described by contemporary historians of the conquest of Mexico by Spain.
