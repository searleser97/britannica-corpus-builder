lima bean,  (Phaseolus lunatus),  any of a variety of legumes (family Fabaceae) widely cultivated for their edible seeds. Of Central American origin, the lima bean is of commercial importance in few countries outside the Americas. There is a wide range of pod size and shape and of seed size, shape, thickness, and colour in both bush and climbing forms. The pods are wide, flat, and slightly curved. The lima bean itself is readily distinguished by the characteristic fine ridges in the seed coat that radiate from the “eye.” Butter beans and giant white beans are some well-known varieties of lima bean.
The plant grows as a perennial in the tropics and is normally cultivated as an annual elsewhere. It requires a longer season and warmer weather than most varieties of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). See also bean.
