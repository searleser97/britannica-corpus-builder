charlotte,  any of several traditional French desserts, typically formed in a deep cylindrical mold. The mold may be lined with buttered bread, sticks of spongecake, or cookies (biscuits) and filled with fruit puree, whipped cream, or ice cream.
Many fruit charlottes are made with well-buttered bread to line the mold. The mold is then filled with a thick puree of apples, apricots, or other fruit and topped with additional slices of bread before being baked. Fruit charlotte typically is served warm, often with a sauce. For cold charlotte, the mold is lined with ladyfingers (sticks of spongecake) or cookies and filled with ice cream, whipped cream, or most commonly, Bavarian cream. If the latter is used the dessert is called a charlotte russe, a recipe thought to have been originated by French chef Marie-Antonin Car√®me.
