Ginger beer,  beverage, once popular in the United Kingdom, made by fermenting a mixture of ginger, water, sugar, cream of tartar, and yeast. Lemon peel and juice or citric acid may also be added. Ginger beer is bottled before fermentation is complete. It is carbonated and mildly alcoholic. There is also a soft (nonalcoholic) ginger beer; it is not as sweet as ginger ale and has a more pronounced ginger flavour. Ginger ale is a soft drink made by combining carbonated water with essence of ginger and other flavourings, colouring, and sugar or other real or artificial sweeteners.
Alcoholic ginger beer was popularized in England during the Victorian era and became a beverage of choice in more distant places, including Canada, Ireland, and the United States.
