The edible M. esculenta, found in woods during early summer, is among the most highly prized edible fungi. The bell morel (Verpa), an edible mushroom with a bell-shaped cap, is found in woods and in old orchards in early spring. False morels, or lorchels, are represented by the genera Gyromitra and Helvella. Most species of Gyromitra are poisonous.
