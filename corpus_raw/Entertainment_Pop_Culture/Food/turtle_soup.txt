Turtle soup,  a stewlike soup made with turtle meat, common in Asia and in Creole cuisine in the United States. The soup gets its consistency from a roux, a thickening agent made by cooking  flour and fat together. Turtle soup also typically contains turtle stock, hard-boiled eggs, and various spices and vegetables. Most Creole recipes feature tomatoes, and some include sherry, a fortified white grape wine. In the United States the meat from snapping turtles is generally used, while Asian recipes tend to call for soft-shelled turtles.
