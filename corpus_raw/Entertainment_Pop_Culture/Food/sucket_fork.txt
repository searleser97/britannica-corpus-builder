Sucket fork,   small metal utensil used for eating sweetmeats, or sucket, with a two- or three-pronged fork at one end of the handle and a spoon bowl, usually of teaspoon size, at the other. A sucket fork is mentioned in Edward VIâ€™s inventory of 1549, but most of the few surviving English and American examples, which are usually made of silver, date from the late 17th century.
