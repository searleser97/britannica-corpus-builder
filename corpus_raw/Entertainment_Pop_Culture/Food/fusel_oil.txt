Fusel oil,   a mixture of volatile, oily liquids produced in small amounts during alcoholic fermentation. A typical fusel oil contains 60â€“70 percent of amyl alcohol (q.v.), smaller amounts of n-propyl and isobutyl alcohols, and traces of other components. Before industrial production of synthetic amyl alcohols began in the 1920s, fusel oil was the only commercial source of these compounds, which are major ingredients of lacquer solvents. The fusel oil alcohols are apparently produced during fermentation from amino acids. In industrial alcohol plants, fusel oil and ethyl alcohol are recovered from the fermented liquors and separated by distillation. In the beverage industry, fusel oil is ordinarily allowed to remain in the finished products. The amount present in a 100 proof distilled alcoholic beverage is typically between 0.5 and 2 grams per litre (0.07 and 0.3 ounce per gallon).
