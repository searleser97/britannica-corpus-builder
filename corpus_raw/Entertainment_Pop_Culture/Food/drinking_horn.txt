Drinking horn,   ceremonial vessel usually made from the horn of an ox or a buffalo or the tusk of an elephant, with mounts of metal. The earliest drinking horns date from around the early 7th century. The drinking horn was largely replaced by other, more suitable vessels in the 16th century, but isolated examples were made later.
