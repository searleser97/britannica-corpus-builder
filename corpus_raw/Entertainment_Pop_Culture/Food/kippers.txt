Kippers,  an iconic British breakfast dish consisting of herring that has been cured via kippering—split open, cleaned, salted, and smoked—and then usually grilled, broiled, or sautéed. The best kippers are pale copper in colour (dark kippers can be undesirable because they are dyed rather than smoked) and hail from northern England, the Isle of Man, and Scotland. Kippers are often enjoyed with butter and lemon and occasionally a poached egg. The dish is sometimes served with tea or at dinner.
