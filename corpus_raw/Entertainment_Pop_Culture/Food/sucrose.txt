Sucrose, or table sugar,  organic compound, colourless sweet-tasting crystals that dissolve in water. Sucrose (C12H22O11) is a disaccharide; hydrolysis, by the enzyme invertase, yields “invert sugar” (so called because the hydrolysis results in an inversion of the rotation of plane polarized light), a 50:50 mixture of fructose and glucose, its two constituent monosaccharides.
Sucrose occurs naturally in sugarcane, sugar beets, sugar maple sap, dates, and honey. It is produced commercially in large amounts (especially from sugarcane and sugar beets) and is used almost entirely as food. See also sugar.
