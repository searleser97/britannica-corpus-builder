Teff,  (Eragrostis tef), sometimes spelled tef,  annual cereal grass (family Poaceae), grown for its tiny nutritious seeds. Teff is native to Ethiopia and Eritrea, where it is a staple food crop to millions of people.
Teff is a tufted or bunching grass with thin narrow stems and a broad crown. The shallow fibrous roots form a massive root system, and the plant is resistant to both drought and waterlogging. The self-pollinating flowers are borne in open panicles and produce seeds that range in colour from white to deep red-brown. Teff seeds are among the smallest of all cereal grains, usually measuring less than 1 mm (0.04 inch) in diameter. Teff utilizes a photosynthetic pathway known as C4 carbon fixation, which largely prevents photorespiration and thus contributes to the plant’s drought tolerance.
Teff is an ancient crop and was likely domesticated more than 6,000 years ago in Ethiopia, which is the major centre of the plant’s diversity. The name teff is thought to originate from the Amharic word teffa, which means “lost” and likely refers to the minute seeds. Teff is a labour-intensive crop and requires significant soil preparation to ensure even sowing and proper seed depth. Additionally, harvesting, threshing, and winnowing are often done by hand, and the tiny seeds are tedious to handle and transport without loss.
Teff flour is used extensively in Ethiopia to make injera, a soft flatbread prepared from slightly fermented batter, and the grains are also used in stews and porridges. The grains have a mild, nutty flavour and are a good source of dietary fibre and protein and are high in magnesium, calcium, and other minerals. Teff has increased in popularity as a gluten-free health food in developed countries and has potential as an alternative food crop. In some places the plant is also grown as a forage or hay crop, and the stalks are commonly fed to livestock postharvest.
