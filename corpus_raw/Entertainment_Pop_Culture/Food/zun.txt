Zun, (Chinese: “sacrificial vessel”)  Wade-Giles romanization tsun,  any of a wide range of ancient Chinese wine vessels. These forms are characterized by an ample interior volume for containing wine and a wide opening for drinking.
There are two essential varieties of zun. One is shaped like a much enlarged gu—that is, tall and somewhat trumpet-shaped. The other variety consists of various animal shapes, which are often densely embellished with animal decoration. These forms were most popular during the Shang (18th–12th century bc) and early Zhou dynasties (1111–c. 900 bc).
