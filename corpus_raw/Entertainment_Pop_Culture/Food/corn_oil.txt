Corn oil,  edible oil obtainable from the seeds (kernels) of corn (maize), valued for its bland flavour and light colour.
The oil constitutes about half of the germ (embryo) of the corn kernel, which is separated from the rest of the kernel during the operation of milling to produce meal, animal feed, hominy, breakfast foods, or other edible solids. The corn germ is dried in a kiln, and the oil is extracted by either a hydraulic or a screw press; the pressed cake is further treated by washing it with a solvent, ordinarily hexane, and the dissolved oil is recovered by evaporating the solvent. The oil cake remaining after solvent extraction is ground and used as an animal fodder known as hominy feed.
Corn oil is used primarily for food. It is favoured as a salad oil and frying oil because it contains little cholesterol; large quantities of it are converted into margarine by hydrogenation, a process in which the oil is combined with hydrogen at high temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalyst.
Corn oil also has multiple industrial uses. For example, it has been incorporated into soaps, paints, and inks. It also has been used in the production of certain insecticides and in the manufacture of biodiesel.
