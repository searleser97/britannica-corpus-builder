Chinese cabbage,  either of two widely cultivated members of the mustard family (Brassicaceae) that are varieties of Brassica rapa.
Napa cabbage, also called celery cabbage (B. rapa, variety pekinensis), forms a tight head of crinkled light green leaves. The slender cylindrical heads are about 30 cm (12 inches) tall, with ‘Michihli’ forms reaching up to 45 cm (18 inches) in height. It has long been grown in the United States as a salad vegetable and is a common ingredient in Korean kimchi.
Bok choy (pak choi), also called spoon cabbage (B. rapa, variety chinensis), has glossy dark green leaves and thick crisp white or green stalks in a loose head. Young tender plants are often sold as “baby bok choy” and have a milder flavour. The plant is commonly used in stir-fries and is especially popular in Asian cuisine.
