praline, French pralin,  in French confectionery, a cooked mixture of sugar, nuts, and vanilla, often ground to a paste for use as a pastry or candy filling, analogous to marzipan; also, a sugar-coated almond or other nutmeat. In the cookery of the American South, the term denotes a candy of sugared pecan meats or coconut.
Pecan pralines, usually made with brown sugar, have been produced for generations by the French-extracted Cajuns of Louisiana. The recipe for this variety calls for a mixture of sugar, light cream, and salt to be cooked to the so-called soft ball stage (i.e., to the point at which a bit of the mixture thus tested retains its shape upon being dropped into cold water), whereupon the brown sugar and nut meats are added.
Praline paste is important in the commercial confectionery and bakery industries as a filling for chocolates, a flavouring for icings and creams, and an ingredient in various doughs. For this preparation, a mixture of sugar and almonds, or sometimes hazelnuts, is cooked and allowed to set. The cool solid is then broken into pieces and ground to an oily paste.
