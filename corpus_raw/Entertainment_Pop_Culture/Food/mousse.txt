mousse,  savoury or sweet dish with the consistency of a dense foam, composed of a puréed chief ingredient mixed with stiffly beaten egg whites, whipped cream, or both. Mousses are almost always cold dishes, and sweet mousses are sometimes served frozen. Savoury mousses are frequently prepared from poultry, foie gras, fish, or shellfish, to be eaten as a first course or light entree. They may be stabilized by the addition of gelatin.
Chocolate mousse, among the best-known types of mousse, may be made from whipped cream or whipped egg whites, with the addition of bittersweet chocolate and sugar. Chocolate and mocha mousses are sometimes made with a custard base. For a fruit mousse, pureed fruit or juice replaces the milk in the custard. The term mousse is also used for gelatin desserts that are whipped to a froth after they have partially set.
Mousse originated in the 18th century in France, where the word mousse translates as “foam,” describing the airy texture of mousse.
