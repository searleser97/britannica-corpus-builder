The filling typically consists of thickly sliced apples (usually crisp and tart varieties) raisins or currants, and various other ingredients that impart flavour, such as sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, rum, and brandy. Appeltaart is cooked in a springform pan, making for a deep pie and a thick flaky crust. Strands of dough are often crisscrossed in a lattice pattern on top, but the pie can also be topped with streusel. It is frequently served with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
