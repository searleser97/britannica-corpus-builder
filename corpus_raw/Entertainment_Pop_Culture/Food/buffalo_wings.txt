Buffalo wing, also called hot wing, chicken wing, or wing,  deep-fried unbreaded chicken wings or drums coated with a vinegar-and-cayenne-pepper hot sauce mixed with butter. They commonly are served with celery and a blue cheese dipping sauce, which acts as a cooling agent for the mouth.
A popular bar food and appetizer, wings can be ordered mild or spicy, and boneless varieties are also common. The name comes from Buffalo, New York, where the dish was created. Several origin stories exist, but the basic recipe is the same.
