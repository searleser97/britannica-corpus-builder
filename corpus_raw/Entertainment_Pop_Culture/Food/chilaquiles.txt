Chilaquiles,  a Mexican dish consisting of strips or pieces of corn tortillas that are fried, then saut√©ed with green or red salsa, and topped with cheese, crema (a sweet, thin cream sauce), and onion. Pulled chicken may also be added during the cooking process, and casserole versions of the dish are popular.  Beans, eggs, beef, and avocado are among the foods often served with chilaquiles. It is typically eaten for breakfast or brunch, much like the Tex-Mex dish migas, which is made with scrambled eggs and tortilla strips. Chilaquiles was originally created as a way to use slightly stale leftover tortillas.
