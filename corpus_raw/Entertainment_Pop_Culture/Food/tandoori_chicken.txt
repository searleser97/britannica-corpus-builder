Tandoori chicken,  a dish of roasted chicken marinated in yogurt and generously spiced, giving the meat its trademark red colour. It is named for the cylindrical clay oven in which it is cooked, a tandoor. The dish is attributed to Kundan Lal Gujral, a Hindu from Punjab state who fled newly formed Pakistan after the 1947 partition of India and opened a restaurant in Delhi. Tandoori chicken quickly became popular throughout South Asia and the Middle East as well as in Western countries. The spices most commonly used include a mix called tandoori masala (typically cayenne pepper, garlic, ginger, onion, and garam masala), red chili powder or Kashmiri chili powder, and sometimes turmeric and paprika. Tandoori chicken is often served on the bones.
