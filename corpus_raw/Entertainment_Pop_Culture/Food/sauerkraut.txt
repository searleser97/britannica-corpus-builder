sauerkraut,  fermented white cabbage, a vegetable preparation important in the cooking of central Europe. Sauerkraut is prepared by finely shredding white cabbage and layering the vegetable with salt in a large crock or wooden tub. The cabbage is covered with a weighted lid and allowed to ferment, preferably at below 60 °F (15.5 °C) for at least a month. Commercially made sauerkraut is canned or sold in bulk. Caraway seeds, peppercorns, and juniper berries are sometimes added to the cabbage during fermentation. Sauerkraut is often served with smoked meats and sausages in dishes such as choucroute garnie and Berner Platte.
Sauerkraut is an ancient preparation. Known to the Romans, it was lost in the West and reintroduced from China via the Tatars in the 13th century. Some type of sauerkraut is made virtually wherever cabbage is a principal vegetable.
