Marshmallow,  aerated candy that originated as a versatile medicinal syrup and ointment; it was made from root sap of the marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis), sugar, and egg white.
The modern marshmallow candy is made from corn syrup, dextrose, gelatine, and egg albumen. A mixture of these ingredients is heated to around 240 °F (115 °C), whipped to twice or three times its original volume, and flavoured.
Finished marshmallow ranges in consistency from chewy to semiliquid. The firmer candy is shaped into the traditional bite-sized “pillows” dusted with rice flour or powdered sugar before packaging; these are sometimes used as a garnish in cooking and are popularly toasted on sticks over an open fire. More elastic marshmallow is often coated with chocolate. The softest marshmallow is used as a base for icings, fudges, and puddings and as a topping for ice cream.
