Hush puppy,  a deep-fried or baked ball of cornmeal batter and spices, usually served as a side dish. Hush puppies are believed to have originated in the southern United States, where they are a traditional dish. They are typically made with cornmeal, flour, egg, buttermilk, baking soda, and onion, though various spices and other ingredients—including garlic and peppers—can be added. The batter is shaped into golf-ball-sized portions and fried or baked. One possible explanation for the name is that a simple version of the dish was first made by various people—such as Union soldiers during the Civil War, fishermen, or runaway slaves—to quiet howling dogs.
