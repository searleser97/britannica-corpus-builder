James Beard,  (born May 5, 1903, Portland, Oregon, U.S.—died January 23, 1985, New York, New York), American culinary expert who championed simple American and English dishes and wrote one of the first serious books on outdoor cooking. In 1945 he became the first chef to demonstrate cooking on network television. Through the James Beard Cooking School, opened in 1955 in Greenwich Village, with a second school added later in Seaside, Oregon, he influenced such future chefs as Julia Child and Craig Claiborne (b. 1920—d. 2000).
Beard’s more than 20 cookbooks included James Beard’s American Cookery (1972) and Beard on Bread (1973). In 1986 the James Beard Foundation was established; its scholarship program played an important role in helping culinary students and professionals continue American culinary traditions. The James Beard Foundation Awards, given out annually (with the exception of 2021), recognize individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the restaurant industry.
