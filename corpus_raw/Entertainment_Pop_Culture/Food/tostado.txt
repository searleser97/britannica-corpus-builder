Tostada,  a crispy fried tortilla, often spread with refried beans or guacamole and topped with vegetables and other ingredients. Popular in Mexico, the tortilla—usually a corn tortilla—is flat or bowl-shaped after frying and given a layer of beans or guacamole thick enough to hold the other toppings. Depending on the region, tostadas might be topped with chicken, pork, or seafood, as well as some combination of lettuce, tomato, onion, cilantro, salsa, cheese, and sour cream. Despite the tortilla being fried, tostada means “toasted” in English. The dish originated as a way to use tortillas once they were too stale for tacos.
