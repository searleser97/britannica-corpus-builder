Turnover,   an individual pie (q.v.), formed by folding a piece of pastry in half over a filling. The open edges are pressed or crimped together to enclose the filling during cooking and eating. Turnovers may be baked or fried. Many turnovers contain savoury fillings; the empanada of South and Central America frequently contains a mixture of chopped meats, hard-boiled eggs, minced vegetables, olives, and raisins, highly seasoned. Russian pirozhki may be filled with meat, fish, cabbage, mushrooms, or cheese. Cornish pasties are large turnovers filled with beef, onions, and turnips; they are the traditional midday meal carried into the pits by miners. Turnovers may also be filled with sweet mixtures or fruit.
