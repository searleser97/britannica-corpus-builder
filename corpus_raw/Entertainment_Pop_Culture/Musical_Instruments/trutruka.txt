Trutruka, also spelled trutruca,  wind instrument used by the Mapuche (Araucanian) peoples of Chile and Argentina.
Technically a trumpet, the trutruka is typically constructed from a long (roughly 8 to 18 feet [2.5 to 6 metres]) straight bamboo tube that is covered with horse intestine and affixed with a cow-horn resonator at its distal end. The instrument is sometimes coiled in the manner of a valveless horn, but it may be made from a metal pipe. It is played by men, usually in ensemble with another trutruka or with other instruments. The trutruka is associated especially with agricultural rites, but it may also be used in other ceremonial contexts or as a signal instrument.
