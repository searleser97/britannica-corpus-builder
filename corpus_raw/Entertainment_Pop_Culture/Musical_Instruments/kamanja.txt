Kamanjā, also called kemanche, or kamānche,  stringed instrument of the fiddle family prominent in Arab and Persian art music. It is a spike fiddle; i.e., its small, round or cylindrical body appears skewered by the neck, which forms a “foot” that the instrument rests on when played. Measuring about 30 inches (76 cm) from neck to foot, it has a membrane belly and, commonly, two to four strings tuned in fourths or fifths. The musician, who plays while seated, rests the foot of the instrument on his knee. The kamanjā is played by soloists as well as in ensembles.
The kamanjā apparently originated in northern Persia and was mentioned by the 10th-century philosopher and music theorist al-Fārābī. Though still common in the Middle East and Central Asia, it has given way in North Africa to the European viola and violin, which are called kamanjās; however in keeping with traditional kamanjā playing style, the instrument is held vertically rather than horizontally.
Both the instrument and the name are widely diffused. In Central Asia, northern India, and Southeast Asia, spike fiddles closely resembling the kamanjā are common under the name rebab. The kamanjā is called rabāb in Turkey; there the derivative name kemençe is applied to a pear-shaped fiddle similar to the Greek lira.
