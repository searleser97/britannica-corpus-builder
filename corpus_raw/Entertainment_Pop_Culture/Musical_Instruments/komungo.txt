Kŏmungo, also spelled geomungo, also called kum,  Korean long board zither that originated in the 7th century. The kŏmungo is about 150 cm (5 feet) long and has three movable bridges and 16 convex frets supporting six silk strings. The front plate of the instrument is made of paulownia wood and the back plate is made of chestnut wood. Various pentatonic tunings are used for different types of music.
The performer sits on the floor with the right end of the instrument supported by the knees. The strings are plucked with a pencil-size bamboo plectrum held in the right hand, while the left hand presses on the strings to play ornamented melodies and create vibrato. Generally only two of the strings are used for the melody while the others serve as drones or fixed pitches. A special tablature notation indicates pitch, rhythm, and fingering.
The kŏmungo was invented in the 7th century ce by Korean musician Wang San-ak. Since the Koryŏ dynasty (918–1392) it has been an essential instrument in court ensemble music (hyang-ak). The kŏmungo is part of many types of court and folk music ensembles and is also used in sanjo, a solo genre designed to showcase a player’s musical virtuosity. The kŏmungo is related to the Chinese zheng, the Japanese koto, and the Korean kayagŭm.
