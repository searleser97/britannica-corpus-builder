Guan, Wade-Giles romanization kuan, also called guanzi,  double-reed Chinese wind instrument, having a cylindrical body with seven frontal finger holes and one thumb hole. The northern version is made of wood, and the southern of bamboo. The instrument’s range is about two and one-half octaves. The length of the guan varies from 7 to about 13 inches (18 to 33 cm). The houguan of southern China is a larger version. Some modern guan have a loosely attached, flaring bell at the end of the instrument.
Historically, the name guan referred to both single and double reed short aerophones. The predecessor of the contemporary guan was the bili of Tang and Song court music (7th–13th century ce). The Korean piri, the Japanese hichiriki, and the Southeast Asian pi are similar instruments.
