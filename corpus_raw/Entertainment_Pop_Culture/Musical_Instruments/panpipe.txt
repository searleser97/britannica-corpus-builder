Panpipe, also called syrinx,  wind instrument consisting of cane pipes of different lengths tied in a row or in a bundle held together by wax or cord (metal, clay, wood, and plastic instruments are also made) and generally closed at the bottom. They are blown across the top, each providing a different note. The panpipe was widespread in Neolithic and later cultures, especially in Melanesia and pre-Columbian South America.
In the Greek legend of Pan the invention of the instrument is ascribed to the nymph Syrinx. In Europe it has been mainly a shepherd’s instrument and has so endured in the Pyrenees. In Romania, however, it is played among professional lăutari (fiddlers); their panpipe, the nai, typically has about 20 pipes tuned diatonically (i.e., to a seven-note scale), semitones being made by tilting the pipes toward the lips. The panpipe also has a long tradition in East Asia and Southeast Asia.
