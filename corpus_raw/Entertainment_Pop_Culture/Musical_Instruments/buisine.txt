Buisine,   long, straight trumpet of the Middle Ages, used for military and ceremonial purposes and, later, for music. It was a six-foot- (almost two-metre-) long counterpart of the shorter trompe, a straight military trumpet, and ultimately gave rise to the later S-shaped and coiled forms of the trumpet.
The name derives from Latin buccina, a Roman shepherdsâ€™ and later military horn made first of animal horn and subsequently of metal. The later buisine was made of brass, copper, or silver.
