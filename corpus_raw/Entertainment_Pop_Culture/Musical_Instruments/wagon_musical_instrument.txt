Wagon, also called yamato-goto,  musical instrument, Japanese six-stringed board zither with movable bridges. The wooden body of the wagon is about 190 cm (75 inches) in length. The musician plays the wagon while seated behind the instrument, which rests on the floor. The strings may be strummed with a plectrum (which is held in the right hand), the fingers of the left hand, or a combination of the two techniques.
The strings of the wagon are not tuned in ascending order but form a pentatonic scale in the following manner (from the string farthest from the player): e′, g′, b′, d′, a′, d″. This unusual tuning relates to the instrument’s primary performance practice, which consists of four arpeggio-like, formalized patterns (san, ji, oru, and tsumu), rather than melodies.
The wagon is closely associated with gagaku (court music), Shintō, and vocal music. Some claim, based on 3rd-century Japanese artifacts, that the instrument is indigenous to Japan, but others believe that it was imported from Korea.
