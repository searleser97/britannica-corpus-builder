Vessel flute, also called globular flute,  musical instrument, an aerophone with a closed, spherically shaped body and a blow hole and sometimes with finger holes. In Africa many vessel flutes are made from gourds or shells; pottery bodies are found in China and Latin America. Ocarinas are often considered globular flutes, but they typically have ducts that guide the air from the blow hole to the edge and usually have more finger holes (see also fipple flute).
