Nagaswaram, also spelled nagasvaram or nadaswaram,  conical double-reed aerophone of southern India. The nagaswaram may be as long as about 95 cm (37 inches). It has a conical bore, is made of dark wood, and has a flaring wooden bell. There are seven equidistant finger holes on the front side and five additional holes toward the bottom that may be filled with wax to adjust tuning. Extra reeds and ivory needles for reed adjustment hang from the instrument. The player blows into the reed of the instrument and uses circular breathing, drawing air in through the nose while expelling air from the cheeks into the instrument, to create a continuous melody. Sometimes several players alternate on the melodic line, which is accompanied by a drone played on the ottu, a similar instrument used only for that purpose.
The nagaswaram has gained recognition in the classical Karnatak music repertoire of the southern Indian concert stage, and it is also used in Hindu ceremonial music. It is related to the shehnai of northern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.
