Tambourine,  small frame drum (one whose shell is too narrow to resonate the sound) having one or two skins nailed or glued to a shallow circular or polygonal frame. The tambourine is normally played with the bare hands and often has attached to it jingles, pellet bells, or snares. European tambourines typically have one skin and jingling disks set into the sides of the frame. The designation tambourine refers specifically to the European frame drum; however, the term is often extended to include all related frame drums, such as those of the Arabic countries, and sometimes those probably unrelated, such as the shaman’s drums of Central Asia, North America, and the Arctic.
In ancient Sumer, large frame drums were used in temple rituals. Small tambourines were played in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Israel (the Hebrew tof) and in Greece and Rome (the tympanon, or tympanum) and were used in the cults of the mother goddesses Astarte, Isis, and Cybele. Today they are prominent in Middle Eastern folk music and are also used to accompany recitations of the Qurʾān. Varieties include the duff (also a generic word for such drums), bandīr, ṭār, and dāʾirah. They are largely played by women.
Crusaders brought the instrument to Europe in the 13th century. Called timbrel or tabret, it continued to be played mainly by women and as accompaniment to song and dance. The modern tambourine reentered Europe as part of the Turkish Janissary musical bands in vogue in the 18th century. It appeared occasionally in 18th-century opera scores (e.g., by Christoph Gluck and André Grétry), and it came into general orchestral use in the 19th century with composers such as Hector Berlioz and Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov.
