Melodeon, also spelled Melodium, also called Reed Organ, or American Organ,  keyboard instrument sounded by the vibration of free reeds by wind. It is an American development of the harmonium, from which it differs in two principal respects. Its foot-operated bellows draw the air in past the reeds by suction, rather than forcing it out by pressure; and the characteristic size and form of the reeds and resonators result in a more even dynamic level throughout the compass. It was slower to respond than the harmonium but sounded more organlike and had a softer tone.
