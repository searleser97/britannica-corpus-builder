Recorder,  in music, wind instrument of the fipple, or whistle, flute class, closely related to the flageolet. Most recorders made since their revival in 1919 by the English instrument maker Arnold Dolmetsch follow the early 18th-century Baroque design: the cylindrical head joint is partly plugged to direct the wind against the sharp edge below, the plug being known as the block, or fipple; the body tapers, and its lowest part is usually made as a separate foot joint; and there are seven finger holes and one thumbhole. Often the lowest two holes are arranged as a pair, so that when one is left open it produces the semitone above the note made when both are covered. The upper register, at the octave, is obtained by “pinching” the thumbhole (flexing the thumb to make a narrow opening above the thumbnail). Larger recorders may have one or more keys.
Most recorders are made in the following sizes (note names referring to the lowest note; c′ = middle C): descant (soprano) in c″; treble (alto) in f′; tenor in c′; and bass in f. Other, less commonly used recorders include the gar klein Flötlein in C‴; sopranino in f ″; great bass in c; and the contra bass in F. The treble and tenor recorders sound at written pitch; the sopranino and descant, an octave higher; the bass, the music for which is written in the bass staff, also sounds an octave higher.
The recorder is a 14th-century improvement upon earlier kindred instruments. The first instruction books were written by the German theorist Sebastian Virdung (1511) and the Italian instrumentalist Silvestro Ganassi (1535). The Baroque repertory is almost exclusively for treble recorder (then called flute, or common flute). After the mid-18th century the instrument became obsolete until its modern revival. (For non-Western variants, see fipple flute.)
