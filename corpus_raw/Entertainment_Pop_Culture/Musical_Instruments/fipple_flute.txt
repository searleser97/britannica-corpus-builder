Fipple flute, also called whistle flute, duct flute, or block flute,  any of several end-blown flutes having a plug (“block,” or “fipple”) inside the pipe below the mouth hole, forming a flue, duct, or windway that directs the player’s breath alternately above and below the sharp edge of a lateral hole. This arrangement causes the enclosed air column to vibrate. Instruments using the fipple-flute principle include one- or two-note whistles, recorders, flageolets, and the organ (in its flue pipes). The flageolet differs from the recorder by having fewer finger holes.
