Luo, Wade-Giles romanization lo,  any of several sizes and styles of Chinese gong. The most common luo are characteristically round and convex in shape, with edges that are turned toward the back. They come in many sizes and may be played singly or in groups; small luo of different sizes (and therefore pitches) may be hung together and used melodically. Usually the instruments are hung on a rack, although some smaller luo are held in the hand. The combination of gongs and drums (luogu) is common in Chinese music and has its own special notation (luogujing).
