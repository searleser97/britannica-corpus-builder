Ṭanbūr, also spelled ṭambūr,  long-necked fretted lute played under various names from the Balkans to northwestern Asia. Resembling the long lutes of ancient Egypt and Babylon as well as the ancient Greek pandoura, it has a deep pear-shaped body, some 1 to 4 dozen adjustable frets, and 2 to 10 metal strings that are typically arranged in single, double, or triple courses. The strings are variously fastened with front and side tuning pegs, typically without a pegbox. The ṭanbūr has remained popular since medieval times. Among its most obvious derivatives are the Greek bouzouki, the Balkan tambura and tamburitza (or tamburica), and the Persian setār. The Indian tambura resembles the ṭanbūr in many respects and, although probably an adaptation of it, is notably a fretless drone (as opposed to melody) instrument. Perhaps also derived from the ṭanbūr—and linguistically linked to the setār—is the Indian sitar.
