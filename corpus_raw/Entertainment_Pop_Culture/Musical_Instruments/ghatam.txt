Ghatam,  large, narrow-mouthed earthenware water pot used as a percussion instrument in India. Unlike other Indian percussion instruments, such as the tabla and mridangam, the ghatam does not have a membrane over its mouth. Ghatam produce a distinctive metallic sound and are made in several sizes, each size having a different pitch. As used in Karnatak music, the ghatam is positioned with its mouth pressed against the playerâ€™s stomach. The player taps the surface of the ghatam with the fingers and the base of the palm and changes the pitch and resonance of the instrument by varying the pressure of the pot against the stomach. The ghatam is usually found in folk music, but it has also become popular in classical music genres. In Kashmir the instrument is known as a noot and is placed in an upright position for playing.
