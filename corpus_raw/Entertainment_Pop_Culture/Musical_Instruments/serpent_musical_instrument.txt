Serpent,   in music, a bass wind instrument sounded by the vibration of the lips against a cup mouthpiece. It was probably invented in 1590 by Edme Guillaume, a French canon of Auxerre, as an improvement on bass versions of the closely related cornett. It is made of wood in a serpentine curve 7 to 8 feet (2 to 2.5 m) long, and it has a conical bore and six finger holes. Originally it accompanied plainchant (Gregorian chant) in churches; from the 18th century, until superseded by brass basses in the 19th century, it was a standard wind bass in military bands. It possessed a rich tone and wide dynamic range. It was the instrument of several early 19th-century virtuosos and was sometimes used in orchestras. In about 1800, keys were added, extending the playerâ€™s reach and allowing higher notes to be produced. Metal serpents also appeared, as did bassoon-shaped versions. Serpents were played in some Spanish bands as late as 1884 and in a few rural French churches on into the early 20th century.
