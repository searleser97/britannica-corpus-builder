Crotal, plural crotales,  percussion instrument consisting of two small metal plates or clappers that are struck together. The krotalon (Latin crotalum) of ancient Greece and Rome was a pair of finger cymbalsâ€”i.e., wooden or metal shells held in one hand and manipulated like castanets, though probably not as rapidly. They were used to accompany dancing and were played almost exclusively by women. Cymbals in the form of two small saucers attached to handles or fastened with leather straps were also used in ancient times. The discovery of finger cymbals in ancient Egyptian tombs inspired modern French composers such as Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel to include crotales in scores that required an Asian or antique tone colour. The term crotal may also refer to a closed bell containing loose pellets, similar in construction to a sleigh bell. This crotal produces a sound when it is shaken and the pellets strike the inner surface.
