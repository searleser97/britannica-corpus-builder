Viola,  stringed musical instrument, the tenor of the violin family. It is built in proportions similar to those of the violin but has a body length of 37 to 43 cm (14.5 to 17 inches), about 5 cm (2 inches) longer than a violin. Its four strings are tuned c–g–d′–a′, beginning with the C below middle C. The viola’s tone is darker, weightier, and warmer than that of the violin. The modern symphony orchestra contains from 6 to 10 violas. The viola is an integral member of the string quartet and larger chamber music ensembles.
In the 18th-century orchestra the viola usually doubled cello parts. Christoph Willibald Gluck, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Joseph Haydn gave it distinctive treatment, and it gradually assumed an independent orchestral role. Hector Berlioz included a long viola solo in his Harold in Italy; in Richard Strauss’s Don Quixote the viola carries the theme of Sancho. The viola also gained in prominence through the viola sonatas of Paul Hindemith, Béla Bartók’s viola concerto, and violists such as William Primrose and Walter Trampler. It was frequently used in 20th-century chamber music ensembles (e.g., by Arnold Schoenberg and Pierre Boulez).
The viola d’amore is a viol-violin hybrid played like a violin. It is of 18th-century origin, has six or seven melody strings and several sympathetic strings, and is unfretted. A 17th-century violin with five wire strings was also called viola d’amore. The viola da braccio, or viola da brazzo (Italian: “arm viol”), was the original name for violin-family instruments, in contrast to the viola da gamba (“leg viol”), or viol, family.
