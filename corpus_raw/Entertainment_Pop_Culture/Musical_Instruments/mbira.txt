Mbira, also called mbila sansa, kilembe, likembe, timbrh, or thumb piano,  plucked idiophone (instrument whose sounding parts are resonant solids belonging to the body of the instrument itself)—or more specifically, a lamellaphone—that is unique to Africa and widely distributed throughout the continent.
The mbira consists of a series of tuned metal or bamboo tongues (lamellae) attached at one end to a soundboard that often has a calabash or box resonator. (The related mbila has tin-can resonators.) At the fixed end, the tongues are pressed down over two bridges by a metal bar. Tuning is adjusted by sliding the tongues to alter their vibrating length.
The mbira is one of several idiophones that are plucked rather than vibrated by percussion, shaken, or scraped. In performance, the player holds the instrument in his hands and plucks the tongues with his thumbs and forefingers. For a rattling tone colour, the tongues are often fitted with buzzing metal cuffs, or metal bottle caps may be affixed to the soundboard or resonator.
Reported by European travelers as early as 1586, the mbira is found in the same areas as the xylophone, to which its tuning is similar and with which it shares several local names. It was taken by enslaved Africans to Latin America, where it developed into a number of unique forms. Many of these Latin American instruments are known by some variant of the term marimba.
