Changgo, also spelled changko or changgu,  hourglass-shaped (waisted) drum used in much of Koreaâ€™s traditional music. It is about 66 cm (26 inches) long and has two heads stretched over hoops; one of them is struck with a hand and the other with a stick. An early Japanese variant of the changgo is the san no tsuzumi, used in Korean-derived court music (komagaku).
