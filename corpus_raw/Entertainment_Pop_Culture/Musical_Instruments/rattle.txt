Rattle,  percussion instrument consisting of resonant objects strung together and set in a sliding frame or enclosed in a container such that when it is shaken the parts strike against each other, producing sounds. In many societies, rattles are associated with the supernatural and accompany religious rites. Slung rattles (shells, bones, hooves, or similar objects strung on a cord or tied in bunches and attached to a dancer’s body) are among the earliest musical instruments, appearing, along with gourd and tube rattles, in prehistoric times. Gourd rattles are particularly prominent as ritual instruments. Where gourds are uncommon, similar rattles are made of basketry, wood, clay, or other material. Gourd rattles known from their use in popular Latin American dance bands are the cabaça (Portuguese for “calabash”), a gourd enclosed in a beaded mesh, and maracas. Rattles are widely considered to have magical power, from the turtle rattles of the Native Americans of the northeastern United States and the gourd rattles of Amazonian Brazil to the shaman accoutrements of Africa and Oceania.
Pellet bells—a familiar variety is the metal jingle bell—are hollow vessels enclosing a single rattling object. In ancient or folk cultures they have frequently been considered to be protective and, as such, have been worn by priests and dancers, especially in ritual dance, and placed on animals. Their use as jewelry reflects their ancient role as protective amulets. Small suzu pellet bells play important roles in the Shinto dances of Japan.
Other varieties of rattle include the sistrum, having sliding bars set in a frame, and the Javanese angklung, tuned bamboo tubes set in a bamboo frame. The word jingle refers to various types of rattles—e.g., slung rattles, pellet bells, and the sliding metal disks on many tambourines.
