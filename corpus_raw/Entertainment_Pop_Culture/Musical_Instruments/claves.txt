Claves,   percussion instrument, a pair of cylindrical hardwood sticks about 8 inches (20 centimetres) long and one inch (2 1/2 centimetres) in diameter, one of which is held in the playerâ€™s fingertips over the cupped hand (a resonator). When struck together they produce a sharp ringing sound.
Claves were originally used in Afro-Cuban folk music and are among the instruments that maintain various fixed rhythmic patterns in Latin-American dance bands. They are modern examples of concussion, or rhythm, sticks, one of the most ancient musical instruments, used in many cultures since ancient times in ritual, in accompanying work, and in calling attention, as well as for musical rhythm.
