Ukulele, also spelled Ukelele,   (Hawaiian: “flea”), small guitar derived from the machada, or machete, a four-stringed guitar introduced into Hawaii by the Portuguese in the 1870s. It is seldom more than 24 inches (60 cm) long.
The ukulele has been played in Europe and the United States as a jazz and solo instrument in the 20th century. It is tuned (in the middle-C octave) g′–c′–e′–a′ or d′–f♯′–a′–b′.
