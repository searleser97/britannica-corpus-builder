Wind-bell, also called wind chime,  a bell or a cluster of resonating pieces that are moved and sounded by the wind. The wind-bell has three basic forms: (1) a cluster of small pieces of metal, glass, pottery, bamboo, seashell, or wood that tinkle when blown by the wind; (2) a cluster of chimes that are rung by a central clapper, to which is attached a flat plate to catch the wind; and (3) a bell whose clapper is attached to a flat plate to catch the wind.
Although the wind-bell has existed from prehistoric times in many cultures, it received its most elegant and prolific development in eastern and southern Asia, from Bali to the Tibet Autonomous Region of China and to Japan, where it was often elaborately decorated, cast, or carved and was hung from the eaves of sacred structures. Buddhists especially made use of wind-bells, attaching them profusely by the hundreds or even thousands to the eaves of temples, shrines, and pagodas, causing during breezy moments an almost overwhelming volume of tintinnabulation. In Asia—and also in the ancient Mediterranean—wind-bells served to attract beneficent spirits. In China and Japan (where they are known as fengling and fūrin, respectively—literally “wind-bell”), they became a decorative art on private homes as well as on sacred structures, and in the 19th and 20th centuries their popular use spread more widely among Western countries.
