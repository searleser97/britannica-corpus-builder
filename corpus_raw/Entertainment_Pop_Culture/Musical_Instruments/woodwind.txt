Woodwind,  any of a group of wind musical instruments, composed of the flutes and reed pipes (i.e., clarinet, oboe, bassoon, and saxophone). Both groups were traditionally made of wood, but now they may also be constructed of metal.
Woodwinds are distinguished from other wind instruments by the manner in which the sound is produced. Unlike the trumpets or other instruments of the brass family, in which the airstream passes through the playerâ€™s vibrating lips directly into the air column, the flutes are sounded by directing a narrow stream of air against the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube. With the reed pipes (e.g., clarinets and saxophones), a thin strip of flexible material, such as cane or metal, is placed against the opening of the mouthpiece, forcing the airstream to pass through the reed before it reaches the column of air that is to vibrate. In double-reed instruments (oboes and bassoons), two thicknesses of reeds are used. The woodwind section of a band or orchestra usually consists of three flutes, one piccolo, three oboes, one English horn, three clarinets, one bass clarinet, three bassoons, and one contrabassoon.
