English horn, French cor anglais, German Englischhorn,  orchestral woodwind instrument, a large oboe pitched a fifth below the ordinary oboe, with a bulbous bell and, at the top end, a bent metal crook on which the double reed is placed. It is pitched in F, being written a fifth higher than it sounds. Its compass is from the E below middle C to the second E above. The name first appeared in Vienna about 1760; “cor” refers to the curved or hornlike shape it then had, but the origin of “anglais” (“English”) remains a mystery. The curved form, which survived locally to 1900, was nearly identical to the 18th-century oboe da caccia and is now sometimes used for J.S. Bach’s parts for that instrument. The English horn was also built in an angular form.
The modern straight form was first exhibited in 1839 by Henri Brod of Paris. The English horn appears in many Romantic works, notably those of Hector Berlioz, César Franck, and Richard Wagner.
