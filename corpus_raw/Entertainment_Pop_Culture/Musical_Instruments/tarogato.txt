T치rogat칩,   single-reed wind instrument, widely played in the folk music of Romania and, especially, Hungary. It resembles a wooden soprano saxophone, but its conical bore is narrower.
The t치rogat칩 was originally a shawm (a loud double-reed instrument). At the end of the 19th century W. Joseph Schunda of Budapest gave it a saxophone mouthpiece (making it a single-reed instrument) and fitted it with a system of keys.
