Hardanger fiddle, also called Harding fiddle, Norwegian hardingfele, or hardingfela,  regional fiddle of western Norway, invented in the late 17th century. It has four bowed strings positioned above four or five metal sympathetic strings. Although slightly smaller than the concert violin, the instrument is held and played in the same manner. It is used to perform rhythmically complex polyphonic music that accompanies a number of traditional Norwegian social dances, including the gangar, halling, and springar.
