Pipe and tabor,   three-holed fipple, or whistle, flute played along with a small snare drum. The player holds the pipe with his left hand, stopping the holes with the thumb and the first and second fingers; the other two fingers support the instrument. A scale is obtained by overblowing, using the second to the fourth harmonics; the gaps between the harmonics are filled by uncovering the finger holes. The tabor, suspended from the playerâ€™s left wrist or elbow, is beaten with the right hand to provide rhythmic accompaniment.
Mention of the pipe and tabor first occurs in the Middle Ages, as an ensemble providing music for court dances. By the 17th century its popularity began to decline, and it survived primarily as a folk instrument. In Provence and Spain, where players of great virtuosity accompany regional dances, the tradition of playing remains unbroken. In England, where pipe and tabor playing was associated with the Morris dancers, the tradition was broken at the end of the 19th century; the 20th-century renewal of interest in English folk music stimulated a revival.
