Flügelhorn,   brass musical instrument, the valved bugle used in European military bands. It has three valves, a wider bore than the cornet, and is usually pitched in B♭, occasionally in C. It was invented in Austria in the 1830s.
In the mid-20th century the flügelhorn found favour in some jazz bands. “Flügelhorn” also sometimes refers to the soprano and sopranino saxhorns.
