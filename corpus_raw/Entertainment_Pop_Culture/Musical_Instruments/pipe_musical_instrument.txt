Pipe,  in music, specifically, the three-holed flute played with a tabor drum (see pipe and tabor); generically, any aerophonic (wind) instruments consisting of pipes, either flutes or reed pipes (as a clarinet), and also the reed and flue pipes of organs. A pipe’s pitch depends on its length, a long pipe having a low pitch. Pipes stopped at one end sound an octave lower than open pipes of equal length. Additional notes are obtained by using fingerholes to alter the length of the air column enclosed by the pipe or by vigorously overblowing, forcing the air column to vibrate in segments and sound overtones (harmonics) of the fundamental pitch.
In reed pipes and organ reed pipes a vibrating reed causes the column of air in the pipe to vibrate. In flutes and organ flue pipes a stream of air passing a sharp edge sets up vibrations in the pipe’s air column. In Scotland pipe is a common term for bagpipe.  See also flute; fipple flute; reed instrument.
