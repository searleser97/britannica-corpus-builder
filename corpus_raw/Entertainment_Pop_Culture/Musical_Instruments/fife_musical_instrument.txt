Fife,   small transverse (side-blown) flute with six finger holes and a narrow cylindrical bore that produces a high pitch and shrill tone. The modern fife, pitched to the A♭ above middle C, is about 15.5 inches (39 cm) long and often has an added E♭ hole covered by a key. Its compass is about two octaves. Fifes of conical bore have also been made since the 19th century.
Antedating the orchestral transverse flute, the fife is first attested in Europe during the 12th century. From the time of the Crusades it has been played with cylindrical side drums as an infantry instrument, notably in Switzerland and Germany. It is a folk instrument in Spain and in the Alps and Carpathians.
