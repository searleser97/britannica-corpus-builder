Ophicleide,   brass wind musical instrument with a cup-shaped mouthpiece and padded keys, the bass version of the old keyed bugle. The name (from Greek ophis and kleid, “serpent” and “key”) alludes to its improvement on the military band “upright serpents” (now-obsolete S-shaped bass instruments sounded by vibration of the lips against a cup mouthpiece) by providing 11 brass keys to replace open finger holes.
The ophicleide was normally built in C or B♭ with the same compass (three octaves) as the euphonium and with a similar tone. It was invented in 1817 by the Parisian Jean Asté, known as Halary, and was extensively used in French and British bands and orchestras until replaced by the tuba near the end of the 19th century.
