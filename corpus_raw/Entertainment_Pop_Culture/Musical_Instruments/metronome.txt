Metronome,  device for marking musical tempo, erroneously ascribed to the German Johann Nepomuk Maelzel (1772‚Äì1838) but actually invented by a Dutch competitor, Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel (c. 1776‚Äì1826). As originally developed, the metronome consisted of a pendulum swung on a pivot and actuated by a hand-wound clockwork whose escapement (a motion-controlling device) made a ticking sound as the wheel passed a pallet. Below the pivot was a fixed weight, and above it was a sliding weight. A scale of numbers indicated how many oscillations per minute occured when the sliding weight was moved to a given point on the pendulum. Thus, the notation ‚ÄúM.M. (Maelzel‚Äôs metronome) ùÖû = 60‚Äù indicated that at 60 oscillations per minute the half note would receive one beat. The conventional metronome was housed in a pyramidal case.
Later, electronic metronomes were developed, and metronomes were made available for computers and smartphones. Small, easily transported metronomes were also made. Metronomes have occasionally been used as musical instruments, such as by Hungarian-Austrian composer Gy√∂rgy Ligeti (Po√®me symphonique, 1962, for 100 metronomes).
