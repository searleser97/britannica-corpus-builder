Kit,   small fiddle with a muted tone, carried by dancing masters in their pockets in the 16th–18th century. A last descendant of the medieval rebec, the kit evolved as a narrow, boat-shaped instrument with usually three or four strings. Later, narrow, violin-shaped kits were also built. Dancing masters used it to play the dance melody and rhythm while teaching the steps.
The instruments were often elaborately carved or inlaid with ivory, tortoiseshell, or gems. A frequent tuning was c′–g′–d″, beginning with middle C.
