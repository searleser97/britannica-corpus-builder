Taegŭm, also spelled tayageum, taekeum, or daegeum, also called chotdae or cho,  large transverse bamboo flute with a distinctive sound, widely used in Korean music. The taegǔm is about 31 inches (80 cm) long. It has a mouthpiece opening and six finger holes, as well as two to five open holes toward the end. A special aperture covered with a reed membrane gives the instrument its characteristic sound. The taegŭm is used as an ensemble or solo instrument in a broad range of genres, from court music to shaman and folk music. A somewhat smaller version, pitched a whole tone higher, is used for the folk and sanjo (virtuosic solo) genres.
