Jackie McLean, byname of John Lenwood McLean, Jr.,  (born May 17, 1931, New York City, New York, U.S.—died March 31, 2006, Hartford, Connecticut), American jazz musician noted for the emotional intensity of his alto saxophone improvising.
From a musical family, McLean became known as a fine altoist in his teens and first recorded in 1951, with Miles Davis, playing “Dig” (also called “Donna”), a McLean theme song that became a jazz standard. McLean played in Charles Mingus’s and Art Blakey’s groups, then won acclaim for his playing and his acting when he appeared with the Freddie Redd Quartet in the Off-Broadway hit The Connection (1959–60). Narcotics addiction interrupted his early career, but in the mid-1960s he toured internationally and then became a music teacher and drug counselor. In 1970 McLean joined the Hartt School of Music (now Hartt School) at the University of Hartford. He helped found the school’s department of African American music in 1980 and served as its first director; the department was renamed the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz in 2000. In addition to teaching, he toured and recorded occasionally.
Initially inspired by Charlie Parker, McLean in time evolved an intense personal style featuring short phrases of irregular length, with considerable inventiveness and often little linear continuity. His saxophone tone grew darker, and the notes he played were microtonally sharp or flat, emphasizing the blues inclinations in his harmonic choices. At first he based his soloing on chord changes, but in his most creative period, the early and mid-1960s, he often used modal procedures as well, punctuating passionate solos with high-register screams reminiscent of John Coltrane’s style. His quintet during this period included such outstanding young musicians as Grachan Moncur III (composer, trombone), Bobby Hutcherson (vibes), and Tony Williams (drums). In later recordings McLean returned to the use of chord changes. His most acclaimed albums included Let Freedom Ring (1962), One Step Beyond and Destination Out! (both 1963), Action (1964), Right Now! (1966), ’Bout Soul (1967), Demon’s Dance (1970), New Wine in Old Bottles (1978), and The Jackie Mac Attack Live (1991). The National Endowment for the Arts named McLean a Jazz Master in 2001.
