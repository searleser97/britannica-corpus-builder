Isthmian Games,   in ancient Greece, a festival of athletic and musical competitions in honour of the sea god Poseidon, held in the spring of the second and fourth years of each Olympiad at his sanctuary on the Isthmus of Corinth. Legend attributed their origin either to Sisyphus, king of Corinth, or to Theseus. Open to all Greeks, the Isthmian Games were especially popular with Athenians. The victorsâ€™ prize, originally a crown of dry wild celery, was changed to a pine wreath in Roman times, the pine being sacred to Poseidon. Celebration of the festival died out when Christianity became dominant in the 4th century ad.
