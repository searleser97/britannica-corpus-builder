Pythian Games,   in ancient Greece, various athletic and musical competitions held in honour of Apollo, chiefly those at Delphi. The musiciansâ€™ contest there dated from very early times. In 582 bc it was made quadrennial, and athletic events including foot and chariot races were added in emulation of the Olympic Games. Open to all Greeks, the contests were held either at the Delphic shrine on Mount Parnassus or on the Crisaean plain below. The victor was awarded a laurel wreath. The games took place in August of the third year of each Olympiad (the four-year period between Olympic Games). The interval between them was known as a Pythiad. They continued to be held until the 4th century ad.
