Interval training,   method of competitive training in which rest and exercise intervals of controlled duration are alternated. Rest intervals allow time for the athleteâ€™s pulse rate to return to near normal before beginning the next exercise period. During exercise intervals, the athlete performs at a specified level of performance, slightly less than his best effort. Interval training is frequently used by track and competitive-swimming coaches.
