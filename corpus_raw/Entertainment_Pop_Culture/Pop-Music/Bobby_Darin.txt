Bobby Darin, original name Walden Robert Cassotto,  (born May 14, 1936, New York, New York, U.S.—died December 20, 1973,  Los Angeles, California), American singer and songwriter whose quest for success in several genres made him a ubiquitous presence in pop entertainment in the late 1950s and ’60s.
At age 8 Darin was diagnosed with a heart defect and was not expected to reach age 16, but this death sentence became the anvil on which he forged his ambition. Moving from performing in New York City coffeehouses into recording in the late 1950s, Darin flopped with his early singles, but in 1958 “Splish Splash,” a novelty song he reputedly wrote in 12 minutes, became an international hit. Other hit singles followed, but, not content to remain a teenage sensation, Darin changed tack in 1959 and began recording adult standards à la Frank Sinatra, whom Darin famously aspired to surpass. The first was a reworking of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill’s ominous “Moritat” from The Threepenny Opera into the finger-popping amoral swagger of “Mack the Knife” (1959). Though other adult hits followed, including “Beyond the Sea” (1960), it was “Mack” that became Darin’s signature song and earned him two Grammy Awards.
In the 1960s, while pursuing a film career (which included an Oscar nomination in 1964), Darin explored a variety of styles before embracing the folk rock movement. In 1966 he had a hit with Tim Hardin’s “If I Were a Carpenter,” but Darin’s musical fortunes subsequently slipped, and in 1973 his heart failed. Darin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.
