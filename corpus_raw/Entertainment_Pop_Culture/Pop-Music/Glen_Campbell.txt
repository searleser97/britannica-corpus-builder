Glen Campbell, in full Glen Travis Campbell,  (born April 22, 1936, Billstown, Arkansas, U.S.—died August 8, 2017, Nashville, Tennessee), American country-pop musician who rose to stardom in the late 1960s and ’70s and became a household name for his hit song “Rhinestone Cowboy,” which topped both the pop and country charts in 1975. 
By the time Campbell was age 14, he had become a good guitarist and was already a performing musician. His talent with the guitar allowed him to make a living as a session musician in Los Angeles when he moved there in 1960. He released his own album in 1962 (Big Bluegrass Special) and two more in 1963 (Swingin’ 12 String Guitar and Too Late to Worry, Too Blue to Cry), but in the meantime he was in high demand to play in studio recordings with musicians such as Elvis Presley (Viva Las Vegas, 1964), the Everly Brothers (Beat & Soul, 1965), Merle Haggard (Swinging Doors and the Bottle Let Me Down, 1966), and the Monkees (The Monkees, 1966). In 1964–65 Campbell joined the Beach Boys to fill in for Brian Wilson, who had taken leave after a mental breakdown. Campbell toured with the band for several months and contributed to the recording of the breakthrough album Pet Sounds (1966).
Campbell’s solo career began to take off with the hit song “Gentle on My Mind” (1967), which earned him two Grammy Awards that year. He followed up with the popular By the Time I Get to Phoenix (1967). The title track of that album became one of his best-known songs and earned Campbell another two Grammy Awards (1967), and that album won the Grammy for album of the year (1968). Two other major hits from that time are “Wichita Lineman” and “Galveston.” From 1969 to 1972 Campbell hosted a Sunday-evening television variety show, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, on CBS. He welcomed to his stage famous personalities such as Ray Charles, Cher, Neil Diamond, Lily Tomlin, Three Dog Night, and Rick Nelson. Campbell made his film-acting debut in 1967 in The Cool Ones and then had a more-prominent role in 1969 in the John Wayne hit western True Grit. The following year he starred in the film Norwood opposite Kim Darby (who had also appeared in True Grit).
During the 1970s—though he had some successful singles, such as “Rhinestone Cowboy,” “Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L.A.),” “Don’t Pull Your Love/Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye,” and “Southern Nights”—Campbell entered a period of heavy drug and alcohol use. He got sober in the mid-1980s and became a born-again Christian, though he continued to struggle with drinking problems throughout the next two decades. He published his autobiography, Rhinestone Cowboy, in 1994, and he recorded new material into the 2000s, releasing Meet Glen Campbell (2008), Ghost on the Canvas (2011), and, his final album, See You There (2013). He was diagnosed with Alzheimer disease in 2011 and subsequently went on a farewell tour, which was documented in the film Glen Campbell: I’ll Be Me (2014). The last song he recorded, “I’m Not Gonna Miss You,” won the Grammy Award for best country song and was nominated for an Academy Award as the theme song to the aforementioned documentary.
