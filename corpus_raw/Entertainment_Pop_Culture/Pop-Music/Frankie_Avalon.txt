Frankie Avalon, byname of Francis Thomas Avallone,  (born September 18, 1939, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American vocalist and actor best known for his chart-topping songs in the mid-1950s and early 1960s and as the star of youth-oriented beach movies.
A wunderkind trumpet player, Avalon was already an experienced performer when, as a Philadelphia teenager, he joined Rocco and the Saints (whose drummer was future pop star Bobby Rydell). Guided by manager Bob Marcucci, Avalon undertook a career as a singer and rose to fame on the Philadelphia-based television show American Bandstand; capitalizing on youthful good looks and a clean-cut image, he became the prototype of the pop-music teen idol created on that program. Rydell and Fabian quickly followed in his footsteps. Between 1958—when his first charting single, “Dede Dinah,” reached the Top Ten—and 1962 Avalon had more than 20 hits (written, for the most part, by Marcucci), including two number ones, “Venus” (1959) and “Why” (1960).
As an actor Avalon teamed with actress and pop singer Annette Funicello as the romantic leads in the Beach Party film series popular in the 1960s. He continued his singing and acting career into the early 21st century, performing in nightclubs and in minor roles on television and film. In addition, he published Frankie Avalon’s Italian Family Cookbook in 2015.
