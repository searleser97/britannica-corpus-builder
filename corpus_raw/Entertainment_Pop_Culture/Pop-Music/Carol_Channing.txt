Carol Channing, in full Carol Elaine Channing,  (born January 31, 1921, Seattle, Washington, U.S.—died January 15, 2019, Rancho Mirage, California), American actress and singer known for her comically outsize performances, gravelly voice, and animated features.
Channing was raised in San Francisco. After modeling and teaching dance in high school, she enrolled at Bennington College in Vermont. Though she ultimately dropped out, during this period she secured work in stock productions and was signed by the William Morris Agency in New York City. In 1941 Channing made her New York City stage debut in No for an Answer, and the following year she first appeared on Broadway in Proof Through the Night.
Chorus and understudy work followed before her breakout role in Lend an Ear (1948), a musical revue that showcased her talent for mimicry. Anita Loos, author of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, saw the show and cast her in the 1949 musical adaptation of her novel as the gleefully scheming Lorelei Lee, who memorably asserted that “diamonds [were] a girl’s best friend.” The role would later be identified with Marilyn Monroe, who played Lee in the 1953 film version. Channing would, however, later reprise her role in Lorelei; or, Gentlemen Still Prefer Blondes (1975).
Channing made her film debut in Paid in Full (1950), a little-seen melodrama. She returned to the stage, touring in Pygmalion (1953) before performing in the Broadway productions of Wonderful Town (1953; toured 1954) and The Vamp (1955), a poorly received musical about a silent film star. She appeared in the television special Svengali and the Blonde (1955) opposite Basil Rathbone and on-screen in The First Traveling Saleslady (1956), a western in which she starred with Clint Eastwood.
In 1964 Channing created what would become the defining role of her career, Dolly Gallagher Levi, an 1890s matchmaker who schemes to wed a wealthy client. The Broadway show, Hello, Dolly!, based on a Thornton Wilder play, was widely acclaimed; Channing received the Tony Award for best actress in a musical. She starred in a number of revivals of the show throughout her career, though Barbra Streisand was awarded the role of Dolly for the film version (1969). Channing’s appearance in the Julie Andrews vehicle Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967) as a loopy society widow represented the apex of her own film career. In later years Channing starred in a number of touring cabaret shows and television specials and did voice-over work for numerous children’s films and cartoons.
In addition to her stage and screen work, Channing released several albums, among them Carol Channing Entertains (1965), Jazz Baby (1994), and For Heaven’s Sake (2010); the latter was a compilation of gospel standards learned from her father. She recorded her show-business reminiscences in Just Lucky I Guess: A Memoir of Sorts (2002). She received a special Tony Award in 1968 and in 1995 was awarded a Tony for lifetime achievement. The documentary Carol Channing: Larger than Life was released in 2011.
