Theodor Leschetizky, original name Teodor Leszetycki,  (born June 22, 1830, Łańcut, Poland, Austrian Empire [now in Poland]—died November 14, 1915, Dresden, Germany), Polish pianist and teacher who, with Franz Liszt, was the most influential teacher of piano of his time.
Leschetizky studied under Carl Czerny in Vienna and thus was linked indirectly with the playing of Czerny’s teacher, Ludwig van Beethoven. In 1852 he went to St. Petersburg as a pianist and teacher. From 1878 he taught in Vienna. As one of the great pianists of the Romantic era, he approached the printed note with a certain amount of freedom. As a teacher, he stressed thorough understanding of the music, absolutely sound technique, and, above all, beauty of tone. Although the celebrated “Leschetizky method” of teaching was much discussed, he himself claimed to have no fixed method, and his students affirmed that he developed the individual characteristics of each student. His pupils included many of the leading pianists of the 19th and early 20th centuries, among them Artur Schnabel, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, and Ignacy Paderewski.
