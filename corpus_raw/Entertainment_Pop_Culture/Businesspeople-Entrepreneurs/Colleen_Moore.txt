Colleen Moore, original name Kathleen Morrison,  (born Aug. 19, 1900, Port Huron, Mich., U.S.—died  Jan. 25, 1988, Paso Robles, Calif.), American actress who epitomized the jazz-age flapper with her bobbed hair and short skirts in such silent motion pictures as Flaming Youth (1923), Naughty But Nice (1927), Synthetic Sin (1929), and Why Be Good? (1929).
Moore, who launched her motion picture career in westerns as Tom Mix’s leading lady, became the consummate flapper and also possessed a comedic talent that she showcased in such films as Irene (1926) and Orchids and Ermine (1927). Her 100 film credits also included several talkies, notably with Spencer Tracy in The Power and the Glory (1933). Under the tutelage of her second and third husbands, both of whom were stockbrokers, she became rich from investments. She wrote the autobiography Silent Star (1968) and the investment guide How Women Can Make Money in the Stock Market (1969). She was also the author of Colleen Moore’s Doll House (1935), a book about her collection of dolls and her elaborate dollhouse known as the Fairy Castle, both of which were put on permanent display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.
