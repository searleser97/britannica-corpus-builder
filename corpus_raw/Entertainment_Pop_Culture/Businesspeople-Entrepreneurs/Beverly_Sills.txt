Beverly Sills, original name Belle Miriam Silverman,  (born May 25, 1929, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died July 2, 2007, New York City), American operatic soprano who won international fame many years before her Metropolitan Opera debut at age 46. After retirement from her singing career, she became a notable arts advocate and fundraiser.
Sills was early destined by her mother for a career in the performing arts. At age four, as “Bubbles” Silverman, she first appeared on Uncle Bob’s Rainbow House, a Saturday morning radio program, and she became a regular. She won a prize on Major Bowes’s The Original Amateur Hour at age 10, made a couple of motion picture shorts, and became a regular on Major Bowes Capitol Family Hour and, later, on the radio soap opera Our Gal Sunday, on which she played a “nightingirl of the mountains.” At age 12 she retired to complete her education in public schools and at the Professional Children’s School in New York, from which she graduated in 1945. Also that year she toured with a Gilbert and Sullivan opera company and in 1947 made her operatic debut with the Philadelphia Civic Opera. She spent several years traveling with touring opera companies and making guest appearances in various opera centres throughout the United States. In 1955 she became a member of the company of the New York City Opera and made her debut as Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus.
Sills married Peter B. Greenough in 1956. The difficult circumstances of their children—one born deaf and the other severely mentally handicapped and autistic—forced Sills to leave the stage in 1961. She returned in 1963 to sing in Don Giovanni, The Abduction from the Seraglio, and Il Trittico. Her performance as Cleopatra in the New York City Opera company’s 1966 production of George Frideric Handel’s Giulio Cesare—noteworthy for her evident vocal accomplishment and the subtlety of her acting ability—brought her to international prominence as a performer of the florid repertoire and made her a celebrity.
Sills then made several appearances in European opera houses, including La Scala in Milan (1969) and Covent Garden in London (1973). Her Metropolitan Opera debut, as Pamira in Gioachino Rossini’s The Siege of Corinth in 1975, was a phenomenal success. She wrote autobiographies: Bubbles: A Self-Portrait (1976) and Beverly (1987). From 1979 to 1989 she was director of the New York City Opera, consolidating the legacy of Julius Rudel while improving its financial and administrative condition. From 1994 to 2002 she was chairman of the board of New York’s Lincoln Center, and from 2003 to 2005 she was chairman of the board of the Metropolitan Opera.
