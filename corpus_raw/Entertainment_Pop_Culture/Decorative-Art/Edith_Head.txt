Edith Head, original name Edith Claire Posener,  (born Oct. 28, 1897, San Bernardino, Calif., U.S.—died Oct. 24, 1981, Hollywood, Calif.), American motion-picture costume designer.
Head was the daughter of a mining engineer, and she grew up in various towns and camps in Arizona, Nevada, and Mexico. She attended the University of California (B.A.) and Stanford University (M.A.). After a time as a schoolteacher and some additional study in Los Angeles at the Otis Institute and the Chouinard Art School, she was hired (1923) by the head designer at Paramount Studios. For several years she worked her way up from sketcher to costume designer by way of apprentice assignments and such minor but memorable accomplishments as designing actress Dorothy Lamour’s first sarong (The Jungle Princess, 1936).
In 1938 Head became chief designer at Paramount, in charge of a costume department with a staff of hundreds. She was the first woman to head a design department at a major studio. From then on, at Paramount and later at Universal Studios, she became America’s best-known and most successful Hollywood designer. She was noted for the range of her costume designs, from elegant simplicity to intricate flamboyance, and she also gained a reputation for being able to placate temperamental actors and directors.
Head was nominated for an unprecedented 34 Academy Awards, winning a record 8 of them for her work in The Heiress (1949), Samson and Delilah (1949), All About Eve (1950), A Place in the Sun (1951), Roman Holiday (1953), Sabrina (1954), The Facts of Life (1960), and The Sting (1973). She was the author of an autobiography, The Dress Doctor (1959), and a self-help book, How to Dress for Success (1967), and appeared as herself on-screen in The Oscar (1966).
