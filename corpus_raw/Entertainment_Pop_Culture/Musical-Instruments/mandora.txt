Mandora, also spelled mandola,  small, pear-shaped stringed instrument of the lute family. It was derived from earlier gittern or rebec models and acquired its name in the 16th century.
Originally, the body and neck of the mandora were carved from a single piece of wood. It had a back-curving sickle-shaped pegbox with lateral tuning pegs. The four or five strings were hitched to the end of the instrument and were plucked with a plectrum. The mandora was increasingly influenced by its larger cousin, the lute. By the 17th century it had 8 to 12 strings in double courses that were finger-plucked, and it had acquired the frets, separate neck, and tension bridge (string holder placed on the belly) of the lute, although it retained the violinlike pegbox. The 18th-century Milanese mandolin was the last lute-style mandora. The term mandora survives as a name for tenor or alto Neapolitan mandolins that became common in the 19th century.
