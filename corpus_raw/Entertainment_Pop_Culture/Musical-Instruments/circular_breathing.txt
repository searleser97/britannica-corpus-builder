Circular breathing, also called nasal breathing,  in music, a technique used by performers on certain wind instruments to maintain a continuous sound. Inhaling only through the nose, the player fills the lungs, then reserves air in the mouth to use in blowing on the instrument. The cheeks often visibly bulge and collapse during this process. It is common in the folk and art musics of many cultures. Instruments played with this technique include the bawu of southwestern China, the didjeridu of Aboriginal Australia, and the nagaswaram of South India. A few American jazz musicians, especially saxophone players, have used the technique for special effects.
