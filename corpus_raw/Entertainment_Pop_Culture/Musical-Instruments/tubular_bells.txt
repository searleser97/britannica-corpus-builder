Tubular bells, also called orchestral bells or orchestral chimes,  series of tuned brass (originally bronze) tubes of graded length, struck with wooden hammers to produce a sound. They first appeared in England in an 1886 performance of Arthur Sullivan’s Golden Legend in Coventry. Large tubular bells were at first used as a substitute for church bells in towers. Smaller tubes were later built to be controlled from an organ manual or, in the orchestra, to be played directly by a percussionist.
As orchestral chimes, tubular bells can attain greater rhythmic precision than true bells, and their tone is clearer, for it emphasizes fewer higher harmonics. The instrument’s compass normally extends 11/2 octaves upward from the C above middle C.
