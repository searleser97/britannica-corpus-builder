Piccolo, (Italian: “small flute”)  in full flauto piccolo,  highest-pitched woodwind instrument of orchestras and military bands. It is a small transverse (horizontally played) flute of conical or cylindrical bore, fitted with Boehm-system keywork and pitched an octave higher than the ordinary concert flute.
The piccolo’s compass extends three octaves upward from the second D above middle C. Its orchestral use dates from the late 18th century, when it replaced the flageolet (also called flauto piccolo). A six-keyed piccolo in D♭ was formerly used in military bands to facilitate playing in flat keys. Piccolo is also the name of an organ stop; the word can be applied to other instruments, such as the piccolo clarinet or the violino piccolo (“small violin”).
