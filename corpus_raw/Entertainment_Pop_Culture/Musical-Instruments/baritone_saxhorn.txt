Baritone,   valved brass instrument pitched in B♭ or C; it is a popular band instrument dating from the 19th century and was derived from the cornet and flügelhorn (valved bugle). It resembles the euphonium but has a narrower bore and three, rather than four or five, valves. Its range extends three octaves upward from the E below the bass staff; the notes in the treble clef are written a ninth above the actual sound. The name baritone sometimes causes confusion; in Germany and often in the United States, the instrument is called both the tenor horn and the euphonium. All three terms may also refer to a saxhorn of similar pitch.
