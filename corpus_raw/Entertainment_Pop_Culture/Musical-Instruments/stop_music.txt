Stop,   in music, on the organ, mechanism controlling the entry of air from the pressurized wind chest into a rank of pipes producing a distinctive tone colour. The word stop also denotes, by extension, the register, or rank of pipes, controlled by a stop. Stop also occasionally refers to mechanisms altering the tone colour of the strings of harpsichords and early pianos.
The earliest organ stops used a slider system. Holes in a strip of wood set in a slider frame coincided with holes in the feet of the pipes of one register. By pushing a knob the organist could slide the holes slightly beyond the pipe feet, blocking entry of air into those pipes. An alternate method was introduced in the 20th century, with electrically operated valves controlling entry of air into the pipes.
Each rank of pipes, such as the diapason, is controlled by a separate stop. Mutation stops consist of pipes sounding higher (e.g., by five notes) than the other pipes, rather than in unison with them. Used in combination with unison pipes they add an incisive quality to the sound. Mixture stops consist of two or more ranks of pipes, both unison and mutation ranks, controlled by a single stop.
