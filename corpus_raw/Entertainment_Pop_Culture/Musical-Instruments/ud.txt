ʿūd, also spelled Oud,  stringed musical instrument prominent in medieval and modern Islāmic music. It was the parent of the European lute. The ʿūd has a deep, pear-shaped body; a fretless fingerboard; and a relatively shorter neck and somewhat less acutely bent-back pegbox than the European lute. The tuning pegs are set in the sides of the pegbox. The gut strings, plucked with a plectrum, are fastened to a tension (guitar-type) bridge on the instrument’s belly.
The ʿūd is not completely standardized in size or number of strings. Four pairs of strings (the classical number) are common, although five and six pairs are also found. Tunings vary; the pitch range is similar to that of a lute or guitar. The ʿūd is known in Turkey as the lauta and in the Balkans as the oud or uti. The kuwītra, a longer necked, narrower variety, is common in North Africa.
The ʿūd appeared in medieval Persia as the barbaṭ in the 7th century ad. Its name, ʿūd (Arabic: “wood”), refers to its aloe wood belly, in contrast to the skin bellies of earlier lutes. Originally, it had a tapered body of one piece with a neck and two crescent-shaped sound holes, much like some East Asian lutes, suggesting a common West Asian origin. In Andalusia during the Muslim occupation of Spain (711–1492) the present form probably emerged, with a separate neck and round sound hole with a wooden rose (three sound holes are now common).
Some medieval theorists mention the frets of the ʿūd when discussing the proper note intervals of the maqāmāt, or melodic modes. Surviving pictures of the ʿūd show no frets, but it is possible that both fretted and unfretted types were used.
