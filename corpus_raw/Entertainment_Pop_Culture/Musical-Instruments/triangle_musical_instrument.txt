Triangle,  percussion instrument consisting of a steel rod bent into a triangle with one corner left open. It is suspended by a gut or nylon loop and struck with a steel rod. It is theoretically an instrument of indefinite pitch, for its fundamental pitch is obscured by its nonharmonic overtones. Some players, however, perceive a suggestion of pitch and often possess more than one instrument. A single stroke on the triangle clearly penetrates the full force of an orchestra, and it is perhaps most effective when used sparingly.
The triangle was known by the 14th century and was sometimes trapezoidal in form; until about 1800 it often had jingling rings. With cymbals and bass drums, triangles were basic to the Turkish Janissary music in vogue in 18th-century Europe, entering the orchestra at that time as a device for local colour. In the 19th century it began to be used purely for its sound, as in Franz Lisztâ€™s Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat Major (Triangle Concerto).
