Harmonica,  either of two musical instruments, the friction-sounded glass harmonica or a mouth organ, a free-reed wind instrument whose invention is often attributed to Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann (maker of the Mund√§oline, Berlin, c. 1821). Whatever its origins, the contemporary harmonica consists of free metal reeds set in slots in a small metal-enclosed wooden frame and supplied with wind through two parallel rows of wind channels. The notes of the diatonic (seven-note) scale are obtained by alternately blowing and sucking, with the reeds positioned to sound by alternate directions of wind flow. A note can be played either by puckering the lips to single out the desired mouth hole in the instrument or by covering unwanted holes with the tongue (usually considered a more-advanced technique). One or more notes can be sounded at a time. In chromatic (12-note scale) models, a finger-operated stop selects either of two sets of reeds tuned a semitone apart. Compass ranges from two to four octaves, and harmonica bands include bass models. The virtuosity of some modern players stimulated several eminent composers (including Heitor Villa-Lobos and Ralph Vaughan Williams) to write for the instrument.
The harmonica is only one of several free-reed mouth organs. The oldest, the Chinese sheng, which was introduced to Europe in the 18th century, provided the principle both for the harmonica and for the short-lived symphonium, in which buttons channelled air from a single mouth hole to the proper reeds.
