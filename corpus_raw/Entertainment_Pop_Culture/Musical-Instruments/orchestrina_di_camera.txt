Orchestrina di camera,   any of a group of small keyboard instruments related to the harmonium, invented and made by W.E. Evans of London. He patented them on Oct. 29, 1862.
Designed to imitate the tone of the clarinet, oboe, flute, French horn, bassoon, and others, they were intended primarily to be used as substitutes for those instruments in orchestral performances when players of the actual instruments were not available. They had bellows-activated free reeds and had the same compass as the instruments they replaced.
