Tambura, also spelled tamboura, tamburi, or tandura,  long-necked fretless Indian lute. It has a hollow neck, measures about 40–60 inches (102–153 cm) in length, and usually has four metal strings tuned (relative pitch) c–c′–c′–g or c–c′–c′–f. Precision tuning is achieved by inserting bits of wool or silk between the strings and lower bridge and by adjusting small beads attached to the strings. In southern India the body of the tambura is made of a hollow piece of jackwood (wood from the jackfruit tree), while in the north it is fashioned from a gourd. It is held in a vertical position, and the musician plays the instrument by plucking the strings while seated behind it. The tambura supplies a drone accompaniment for both classical and folk music of South Asia, and it provides an essential tonal foundation from which a singer or instrumental soloist develops the raga (melodic, modal, and rhythmic framework for Indian music composition and improvisation). It resembles the tanbur, the Middle Eastern lute from which it derives.
