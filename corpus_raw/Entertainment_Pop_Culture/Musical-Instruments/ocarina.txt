Ocarina, (Italian: “little goose”, ) also called Sweet Potato,  globular flute, a late 19th-century musical development of traditional Italian carnival whistles of earthenware, often bird-shaped and sounding only one or two notes. It is an egg-shaped vessel of clay or metal or, as a toy, of plastic and is sounded on the flageolet, or fipple flute, principle. It usually has eight finger holes and two thumbholes and may have a tuning plunger.
In the 1930s it won professional popularity when “sweet potatoes” of different sizes were played in harmony in American popular music. The ocarina is a well-known European example of the globular flute, a form that occurs in many ancient and modern cultures.
