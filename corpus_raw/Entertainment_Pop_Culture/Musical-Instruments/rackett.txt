It consisted of a short wooden or ivory cylinder typically bored with nine extremely narrow channels connected in a series. In the earlier forms the cylindrically bored channels emerged at the side or bottom of the instrument; the Baroque instrument had a modified conical bore, and the channels emerged at the top of the instrument.
Finger holes were provided. The sound was reedy, low-pitched, and muffled. The compass was a 12th.
