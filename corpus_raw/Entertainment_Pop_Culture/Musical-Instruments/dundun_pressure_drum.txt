Dùndún pressure drum,   double-membrane, hourglass-shaped drum of the Yoruba people of southwestern Nigeria. It is capable of imitating the tones and glides of the spoken language and is employed by a skilled musician to render ritual praise poetry to a deity or king. It has counterparts in East Africa, Asia, and Melanesia.
The term pressure drum derives from the shape of the instrument’s body, which is waisted, or smaller in diameter in the middle than it is at each end. The drum is suspended from the player’s left shoulder; the left hand manipulates the leather tensioning thongs that connect the two membranes, while the drum is beaten with a curved stick held in the right hand. By tightening or loosening the thongs, the player is able to control (i.e., to raise or lower) the pitch of the drum.
The set of six dùndún (called ìyá ìlù, gùdùgùdù, kerikeri, ìfájú, kànàngó, and gàngan) is generally part of any Yoruba ceremony or festival, taking the lead in town processions. All except the gùdùgùdù can be used for “talking.”
