Baryton,   bowed, stringed musical instrument that enjoyed a certain vogue in the 18th century. It was related to the viol family, was about the size of a cello, and had six melody strings and a fretted fingerboard. Up to 40 sympathetically vibrating strings, some of which were plucked with the left-hand thumb, ran behind the wide neck. Joseph Haydn wrote 175 baryton compositions for his patron, Prince Miklós Esterházy, a skilled baryton player.
