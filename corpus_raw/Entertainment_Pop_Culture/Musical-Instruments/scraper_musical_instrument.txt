Scraper,  in music, percussion instrument consisting of a serrated surface that is rasped with a stick. Known since the Stone Age, it is often associated with magical powers and ritual, and it is widely distributed geographically. Scrapers are commonly made of bone, as the Aztec used in memorial rites; gourd, such as the guiro of Mexican and Cuban folk music and Latin American dance bands; wood, as in the Chinese yu, or wooden tiger, used in Confucian ritual; horn, as in the charrasca (also called guiro) of Venezuelan folk music; and shell. They are sometimes resonated over a hole or a gourd.
The cog rattle, or ratchet, is a more complex scraper, consisting of a cog wheel set in a frame to which a flexible tongue is attached; when the wheel revolves on its axle, the tongue scrapes the cogs. Found in Europe and Asia, cog rattles often served as signal instruments (during both World Wars they were used to warn of gas attacks), and they also had ritual use (e.g., in medieval Roman Catholic services during the week before Easter). They are now common as toys and as festive noisemakers (a remnant of practices of creating a clamour to frighten away evil spirits). Richard Strauss scored for cog rattle in his symphonic poem Till Eulenspiegel (1895) and Igor Stravinsky for guiro in The Rite of Spring (1913).
