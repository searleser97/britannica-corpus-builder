Barrel organ,   musical instrument in which a pinned barrel turned by a handle raises levers, admitting wind to one or more ranks of organ pipes; the handle simultaneously actuates the bellows. Ten or more tunes can be set on one barrel.
Barrel organs are valuable because they preserve old styles of musical ornamentation. They reached a peak of popularity in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; some played the psalms in village churches until well into the 20th century. They are sometimes confused with other handle-operated street instruments, including the barrel piano and the hurdy-gurdy.
