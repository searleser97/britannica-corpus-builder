Idiophone,  class of musical instruments in which a resonant solid material—such as wood, metal, or stone—vibrates to produce the initial sound. The eight basic types are concussion, friction, percussion, plucked, scraped, shaken, stamped, and stamping. In many cases, as in the gong, the vibrating material itself forms the instrument’s body. Other examples include xylophones and rattles.
A plucked idiophone, such as a jew’s harp or a music box, is known as a lamellaphone. The names idiophone and membranophone (membrane instruments, such as drums) replace the looser term percussion instruments when a precise, acoustically based classification is required. See also aerophone; chordophone; electrophone; membranophone.
