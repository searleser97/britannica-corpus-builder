Paixiao, Wade-Giles romanization p’ai-hsiao,  Chinese bamboo panpipe, generally a series of bamboo tubes secured together by rows of bamboo strips, wooden strips, or ropes. The instrument is blown across the top end. Although 16 pipes have become the standard, other groupings (from 13 to 24) have been made. Before the Tang dynasty (ad 618–907) the panpipe was called xiao, a name that from that time forward was applied to a single-tube end-blown flute.
The arrangement of the pipes formed a shape that was described by ancient writers as resembling the wings of the mythical fenghuang birds. Single-winged paixiao appear to have been the most common among the early examples, and the double-wing shape (with the pipes lengthening toward the two ends) predominated later. There also exist paixiao made up of pipes that are all of about the same length; wax is positioned inside the pipes to adjust pitch.
The earliest complete paixiao was a stone single-wing model with 13 pipes, 3 to 15 cm (1.2 to 5.8 inches) long, from a tomb in Henan province dated about 552 bc. Two bamboo panpipes with 13 pipes in single-wing shape, ranging from 5.1 to 22.5 cm (2 to 8.8 inches) in length, were excavated from the tomb of Zenghouyi (Marquis Yi of Zeng) in Hubei province (433 bc). Not only was the paixiao a member of the ancient ritual orchestra, but it was also a favourite instrument in entertainment ensembles and military bands. Literary and iconographic sources concerning the instrument are abundant. After the Song dynasty (ad 960–1279), the importance of the paixiao declined dramatically, and it survived only in the ritual orchestra. As an important remnant of China’s musical past, it has seen some return to use as an aural reminder of ancient times.
