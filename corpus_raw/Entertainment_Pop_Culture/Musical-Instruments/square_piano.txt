Square piano,   musical instrument that was popular for domestic music-making from the time of its invention in the mid-18th century (possibly by the Saxon organ-builder Ernst Christian Friderici) to about 1860 in Europe and to about 1880 in the United States. This type of piano was introduced in France by the instrument-builder Sébastien Érard (c. 1777) and was already popular in England after about 1760, thanks largely to the efforts of Johann Christoph Zumpe and other immigrant German builders, who concentrated on building square pianos with a simple, so-called single action (mechanism) that was adequate for the demands of most salon music.
The strings of the square (actually rectangular) piano run horizontally across the instrument from side to side, like those of a clavichord, which probably was the source of the design. The earliest square pianos were difficult to keep in tune, but engineering improvements and the introduction of metal frames stabilized the case. The compass gradually grew from the original five octaves but seldom reached the 88-key range of modern pianos. The soundboard likewise grew in size, and late square pianos were often longer than 6 feet (1.8 m) and heavier than comparable grand pianos. Near the end of the 19th century, square pianos were supplanted by upright pianos, which allowed larger soundboards, extended range, and reduced weight and floor space.
