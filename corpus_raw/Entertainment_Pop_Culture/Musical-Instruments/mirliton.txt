Mirliton,  musical instrument or device in which sound waves produced by the playerâ€™s voice or by an instrument vibrate a membrane, thereby imparting a buzzing quality to the vocal or instrumental sound.
A common mirliton is the kazoo, in which the membrane is set in the wall of a short tube into which the player vocalizes. Tissue paper and a comb constitute a homemade mirliton. Mirlitons are also set in the walls of some flutes (e.g., the Chinese ti) and xylophone resonators to colour the tone. The mirliton is one of the few types of membranophones (membrane instruments) not sounded by percussion.
