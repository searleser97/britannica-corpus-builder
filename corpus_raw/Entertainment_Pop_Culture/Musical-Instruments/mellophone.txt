Mellophone, also called ballad horn, concert horn, mellohorn, or tenor cor,  a valved brass musical instrument built in coiled form and pitched in E♭ or F, with a compass from the second A or B below middle C to the second E♭ or F above. The alto and tenor forms substitute for the French horn in marching bands. In the 1950s a version called the mellophonium was developed for concert use; its French horn-style bell faces forward. The mellophone bears no relationship to the mélophone, a free-reed instrument.
