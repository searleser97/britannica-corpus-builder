Reed organ,   any keyboard instrument sounded by vibration of metal reeds under wind pressure. “Reed organ” commonly refers to instruments having free reeds (vibrating through a slot with close tolerance) and no pipes.
Such instruments include the harmonium and the melodeon (qq.v.) and are distinct from organs proper (i.e., pipe organs). A type of small pipe organ describable as a reed organ is the regal (q.v.), which has beating reeds (vibrating against a frame) and pipe resonators.
