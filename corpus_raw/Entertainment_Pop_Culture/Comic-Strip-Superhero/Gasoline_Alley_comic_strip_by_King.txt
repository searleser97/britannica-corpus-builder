Gasoline Alley,  long-running comic strip created by Frank King during his tenure as a cartoonist at the Chicago Tribune. King named the strip Gasoline Alley because it dealt with a group of automobile enthusiasts who met in an alley. The strip appeared first in 1919, and in 1921 its narrative was given  additional family interest when the principal character, Walt Wallet, found a newborn infant on his doorstep. Walt named the baby Skeezix (a cowboy slang term for an orphaned calf), and after that the characters aged in “real time”—they grew older, married, and had children of their own. Skeezix, for instance, went through high school in the 1930s and was middle-aged in the 1960s. The strip inspired a radio show (1941–49) and a pair of films (1951), and it continued well past King’s retirement, first for nearly three decades under Dick Mores and then under Jim Scancarelli.
