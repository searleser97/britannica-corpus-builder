Betty Boop,  flirtatious, seductive cartoon character of 1930s animated short films produced by Max Fleischer and directed by his brother Dave. Modeled on the sexy, coy flapper of the 1920s, in particular the singer Helen Kane, Betty Boop has huge eyes, long eyelashes, which she bats frequently, and a distinctive high-pitched voice, provided by various actresses, notably Mae Questel. Betty frequently punctuates her sentences with the exclamation “Boop-oop-a-doop!” She wears strapless short-skirted dresses and on her left thigh a fancy garter, which she sometimes snaps coquettishly.
Animator Grim Natwick originally drew the character as a small dog. From 1932 Betty was all human—so much so that she was the first cartoon character to be censored by the Hays Office. Betty Boop cartoons were very popular with the American public; among the best films of the series were Dizzy Dishes (1930), I’ll Be Glad When You’re Dead You Rascal You (1932), The Old Man of the Mountain (1933), Snow-White (1933), and Red Hot Mamma (1934). After Betty’s image was tamed by the onset of the Production Code in 1934, her popularity declined and the series was discontinued in 1939.
