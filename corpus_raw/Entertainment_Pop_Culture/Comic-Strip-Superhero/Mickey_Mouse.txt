Mickey Mouse,  the most popular character of Walt Disney’s animated cartoons and arguably the most popular cartoon star in the world.
Walt Disney began his first series of fully animated films in 1927, featuring the character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. When his distributor appropriated the rights to the character, Disney altered Oswald’s appearance and created a new character that he named Mortimer Mouse; at the urging of his wife, Disney rechristened him Mickey Mouse. Two silent Mickey Mouse cartoons—Plane Crazy (1928) and Gallopin’ Gaucho (1928)—were produced before Disney employed the novelty of sound for the third Mickey Mouse production, Steamboat Willie (1928), though Mickey did not utter his first words (“Hot dogs!”) until The Karnival Kid (1929). Steamboat Willie was an immediate sensation and led to the studio’s dominance in the animated market for many years.
During the early years, Mickey was drawn by noted animator Ub Iwerks, and Disney himself provided Mickey’s voice until 1947. Mickey was often joined by his girlfriend, Minnie Mouse, as well as an animated gang of friends that included Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto. Mickey was a cheerful and mischievous anthropomorphic rodent who starred in more than 100 cartoon shorts and became a worldwide cult figure. The Mickey Mouse Club was one of the most popular television shows for children in the United States in the 1950s, and the signature black cap with mouse ears worn by the show’s stars has become one of the most widely distributed items in merchandising history. In 1932 Disney was given a special award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the creation of Mickey Mouse.
