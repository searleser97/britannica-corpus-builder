Charlie Brown,  American comic strip character, one of the main figures in Peanuts, Charles Schulz’s enormously popular, highly acclaimed American newspaper and paperback cartoon strip (first run on October 2, 1950).
The hapless Charlie Brown (who was usually called by both names—though Peppermint Patty invariably called him Chuck and the bespectacled Marcie called him Charles) was an indecisive, likable, easily embarrassed elementary-school boy. (Schulz considered him his alter ego.) He represented a youthful Everyman. He was often tormented by Lucy van Pelt, always dusted himself off and tried again after repeated failures, and never worked up the courage to speak to the “little red-haired girl,” for whom he pined. While expecting the worst, he hoped for the best, as evidenced by his role as the manager of a perennially underperforming baseball team. Other running gags included Charlie Brown’s attempts to fly a kite, which were often frustrated by a kite-eating tree, and his inability to kick a football that was always pulled away at the last moment by Lucy. In spite of those setbacks, he boasted occasional victories, such as when he triumphed over a neighbourhood bully in a game of marbles.
Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang—which, in addition to the human characters, included Charlie Brown’s beagle, Snoopy, and a little yellow bird, Woodstock—were featured in many animated television specials, beginning with A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965); in an award-winning, highly successful, long-running live-action stage musical, You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown (1967); and in many cartoon films, including A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969) and The Peanuts Movie (2015).
