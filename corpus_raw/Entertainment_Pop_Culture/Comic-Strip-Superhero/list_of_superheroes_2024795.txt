 Superheroes have their antecedents in the semidivine heroes of myth and legend. Protagonists who exhibit feats of incredible strength, fighting prowess, and cunning are commonplace in both scripture and early secular literature. Comic strips of the early 20th century provided the perfect visual medium for the development for these larger-than-life characters, and in June 1938 writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joseph Shuster unveiled Superman, the archetypal superhero. Superheroes have proved to be an enduring addition to popular culture, eventually spreading to radio, film, television, and electronic games. This is an alphabetically ordered list of superheroes.
