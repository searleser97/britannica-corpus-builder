Snoopy,  comic-strip character, a spotted white beagle with a rich fantasy life. The pet dog of the hapless Peanuts character Charlie Brown, Snoopy became one of the most iconic and beloved characters in the history of comics.
Although Charlie Brown was ostensibly the main character in Charles Schulz’s long-running strip, more often than not his dog stole the show. The strip began in 1950, and, before that decade was over, Snoopy had begun walking on two feet and communicating with readers through cartoon “thought bubbles.” Although the other characters in the strip were not privy to Snoopy’s thoughts, they often spoke to him as if he were human and even made him a star player on their baseball team.
Lying on the roof of his doghouse, Snoopy spent much of his time daydreaming. In one of his recurring flights of fancy, he was the World War I Flying Ace, who, sporting pilot’s goggles and a flowing red scarf, with his doghouse transformed into a fighter plane, waged fierce aerial battles against his nemesis, the Red Baron. This rivalry was the subject of a pair of popular novelty songs by the American rock group the Royal Guardsmen in the mid-1960s. Snoopy’s other alter egos included the jazz saxophonist Joe Cool and a soldier in the French Foreign Legion. Woodstock, a small yellow bird whose exact species was never identified by Schulz, was introduced in the late 1960s and soon became a sidekick for Snoopy, accompanying him on his many adventures.
Snoopy was prominently featured in numerous Peanuts animated television specials and movies, including Snoopy Come Home (1972), as well as the Broadway musical You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown (1967) and the feature film The Peanuts Movie (2015). In the 1960s the Snoopy character became a mascot for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
