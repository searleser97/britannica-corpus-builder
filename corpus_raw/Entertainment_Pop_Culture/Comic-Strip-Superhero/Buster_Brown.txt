Buster Brown,  a comic strip character created in 1902 by newspaper cartoonist Richard F. Outcault for the New York Herald. Buster Brown is a wealthy schoolboy prankster who dresses conservatively but acts like a mischievous, disorderly child. He has a sister, Mary Jane, and a grinning talking pet bulldog, Tige (one of the first talking animals in newspaper cartoons). Buster Brown was frequently drawn practicing the violin (all the strings have snapped and Tige, howling, covers his ears in agony). At the end of almost every Sunday cartoon strip, Buster Brown promises to behave better in the future, but he never does.
Buster Brown comic strips were published until the 1920s; they have been revived sporadically. An American manufacturer of children’s shoes licensed the Buster Brown and Mary Jane names for a popular line of children’s footwear (the trademark has since lapsed on the latter name, and Mary Janes have come to refer to any girls’ or women’s strapped shoe with a low heel).
