Little Orphan Annie,  American newspaper comic strip depicting the adventures of a plucky street urchin. Little Orphan Annie enjoyed an extraordinarily long life in newspapers, on stage, and in film.
Making her first appearance on Aug. 5, 1924, Annie—who was conceived as an 11-year-old escapee from a Dickensian orphanage—was identifiable by her curly red hair. Joined by her faithful dog, Sandy, she made her way mostly alone in the world, encountering criminals, spies, and all manner of evildoers, foiling them all in the end, and inevitably reuniting with her protector, the self-made millionaire Oliver (“Daddy”) Warbucks.
Cartoonist Harold Gray initially proposed a new feature to the Chicago Tribune Syndicate titled “Little Orphan Otto,” but the syndicate suggested that the lead character be female. Although Gray’s artwork was relatively unsophisticated compared with that of many of his fellow cartoonists, his storytelling riveted his readers and made Annie one of the most successful adventure strips of the 20th century.
Gray wrote and drew the serial until his death in 1968, after which the syndicate tried and failed to recapture the strip’s spirit with several replacements. From 1974 to 1979 they simply reprinted old strips. After the opening and resounding success of an Annie Broadway musical (1977–83, revived on Broadway in 1997), the strip was relaunched in 1979 with cartoonist Leonard Starr. When Starr retired in 2000, the feature was significantly redesigned and modernized by writer Jay Maeder and artist Andrew Pepoy. The Tribune Syndicate discontinued the daily print version of the comic in June 2010. Several Annie movies were made, the first in 1932; a television movie aired in 1999.
