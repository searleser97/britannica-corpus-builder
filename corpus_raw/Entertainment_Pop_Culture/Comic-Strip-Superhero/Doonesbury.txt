Doonesbury,  American newspaper comic strip chronicling the lives of a large group of characters, mostly a set of college friends, over the years. Doonesbury’s humour has been noted for its explicitly political content.
The strip’s namesake is Mike Doonesbury, who serves as an everyman for America’s post-World War II baby boom generation. Once an idealistic student, over the years Mike finds himself compromising his principles in his work and shifting his political leanings. Other prominent characters include performance artist J.J. Caucus, Mike’s ex-wife; her mother, Joanie, a lawyer and ardent feminist; Mark Slackmeyer, a campus activist turned radio host; Zonker Harris, an archetypal slacker; B.D., a college football star and veteran of the Vietnam War and both of America’s Persian Gulf wars; and the amoral Uncle Duke, initially a parody of countercultural journalist Hunter S. Thompson, whose persona evolved into that of a perpetually stoned consummate scam artist who is always looking for an easy way to make money on the world stage.
Cartoonist Garry Trudeau created Doonesbury in 1970 out of characters from his strip Bull Tales in the Yale Daily News. In the early years the main characters were college students who did not perceptibly age. In 1984 Trudeau began aging the cast in real time. They married (or took partners), had children, pursued careers, and grew into middle age.
Events in the characters’ lives reflect the changing social and political climate in which they live, and Trudeau made a point of satirizing each federal administration and various political figures and events. In response to Doonesbury’s overtly liberal politics, some newspapers published it on their editorial pages rather than in their comic sections. In 1975 Trudeau became the first comic strip artist to win a Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning.
