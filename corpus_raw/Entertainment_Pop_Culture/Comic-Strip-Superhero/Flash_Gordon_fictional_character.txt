Flash Gordon,  spaceman hero of the science-fiction comic strip Flash Gordon, created in 1934 by illustrator Alex Raymond and writer Don Moore as a Sunday feature for King Features Syndicate. Intended to compete with the popular comic strip Buck Rogers (which it soon surpassed in popularity), the series concerned the intergalactic adventures of Flash Gordon, his girlfriend Dale Arden, and the scientist Dr. Hans Zarkov on the alien planet Mongo.
Flash Gordon was a Yale graduate and a well-known polo player. He and his two companions journeyed in Dr. Zarkov’s rocket ship to the planet Mongo, which posed an imminent danger to Earth’s existence. Flash, Dale, and Dr. Zarkov constantly faced death as they fought against Ming the Merciless, the evil emperor of Mongo.
Flash was featured in a radio program and as the hero of a novel, Flash Gordon in the Caverns of Mongo (1936), attributed to Alex Raymond. Buster Crabbe played the blond spaceman in Flash Gordon film serials (from 1936) and in the subsequent serials, Flash Gordon’s Trip to Mars (1938) and Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940). The character appeared on television in both live-action (1954–55; 2007–08) and animated (1979–80; 1996) series. The feature-length film Flash Gordon (1980) was equal parts science fiction and high camp, and, although a failure at the box office, it was perhaps best remembered for its synthesizer-fueled soundtrack, provided by the rock group Queen.
