Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo,  ballet company founded in Monte-Carlo in 1932. The name Ballets Russes had been used by the impresario Serge Diaghilev for his company, which revolutionized ballet in the first three decades of the 20th century. Under the direction of Colonel W. de Basil, the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo brought to audiences new compositions by Léonide Massine and George Balanchine, with such dancers as Aleksandra Danilova, Leon Woizikowki, and David Lichine. Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo divided into new competitive companies in 1938, one under de Basil, the other under Massine.
De Basil renamed his company the Royal Covent Garden Ballet Russe and finally the Original Ballet Russe (1939); the company toured internationally before dissolving in 1948.
Massine, with René Blum, formed another Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo with the dancers Danilova, Tamara Toumanova, Dame Alicia Markova, Mia Slavenska, Serge Lifar, Igor Youskevitch, and André Eglevsky and new choreography by Massine. This company performed principally in the U.S., produced traditional revivals and works by U.S. choreographers, and featured U.S. dancers, including Maria Tallchief. The company declined in the 1950s and ceased producing in 1963; its ballet school was maintained in New York City for a time. Massine and Sergei Denham organized the new Ballets de Monte Carlo in 1966 under the patronage of Prince Rainier III of Monaco.
