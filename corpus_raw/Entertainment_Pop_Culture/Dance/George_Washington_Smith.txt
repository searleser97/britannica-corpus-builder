George Washington Smith,  (born c. 1820, Philadelphia—died  Feb. 18, 1899, Philadelphia), American dancer, ballet master, and teacher, considered the only male American ballet star of the 19th century.
Smith’s talents were developed by studying with various visiting European teachers in his native Philadelphia, then a mecca for theatre and dance. His performing debut was made in 1832, and he soon grew into a versatile dancer, admired for his skills as a technician, actor, partner, and pantomimist.
In 1840 the Viennese ballerina Fanny Elssler and her British partner, ballet master James Silvain, arrived in Philadelphia for a two-year American tour. Smith worked with them, performing one of his most noted roles, that of Harlequin. When they left, Smith used his harlequinade talents and appeared in a pantomime, Mazulme, or The Black Raven of the Tombs, a role for which he became noted. Smith’s ballet studies continued with the Philadelphian P.H. Hazard, under whom he and Mary Ann Lee became the leading dancers in the first American production of Giselle, performed in Boston in 1846. Smith was a choreographer and teacher in his later years.
