Bolero,   lively Spanish dance in 3/4 time with a strongly marked rhythm. The dancers, either singly or as couples, execute brilliant and intricate steps to the rhythmic accompaniment of their castanets. Distinctive features are the paseo (“walk”), bien parado (“sudden stop”), and various beating steps (battements). An outstanding musical example is Maurice Ravel’s Bolero (1928) for orchestra. The Latin-American bolero is a slow, romantic rumba danced with simple steps.
