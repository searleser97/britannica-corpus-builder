Mazurka, Polish mazurek,  Polish folk dance for a circle of couples, characterized by stamping feet and clicking heels and traditionally danced to the music of a village band. The music is in 3/4 or 3/8 time with a forceful accent on the second beat. The dance, highly improvisatory, has no set figures, and more than 50 different steps exist. The music written for the dance is also called mazurka.
The mazurka originated in roughly the 16th century among the Mazurs of east-central Poland and was quickly adopted at the Polish court, yet it remained a folk dance. It eventually spread to Russian and German ballrooms and by the 1830s had reached England and France. As a ballroom dance intended for four or eight couples or for single couples, the mazurka retains room for improvisation. The volume of mazurkas composed for piano by Frédéric Chopin  (some 57) reflects his interest in the music of his homeland as well as the dance’s popularity in his day. The varsovienne (Italian varsoviana) is a 19th-century French couple dance that evolved from a simple mazurka step. Also closely related to the mazurka are the smooth, somewhat slower kujawiak and the energetic oberek.
