Strathspey,  slow Scottish dance for four or five couples, a variety of country dance. Its music, in 4/4 time, is characterized by frequent use of the “Scotch snap,” a short-long rhythmic figure that is equivalent to a 16th note followed by a dotted 8th note. The dance apparently originated about 1700 in the valley (Scottish strath) of the River Spey in Scotland. Strathspey was originally synonymous with reel, but since the 18th century strathspey has referred to a slower dance than the reel.
