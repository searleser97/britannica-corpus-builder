Ida Rubinstein,  (born 1885, St. Petersburg, Russia—died  Sept. 20, 1960, Vence, France), dancer, actress, and patron of the performing arts.
An orphan of a well-to-do Jewish family, Rubinstein used her sizable inheritance for commissions for the arts. As a young woman she studied mime and recitation and was a great admirer of the American dancer Isadora Duncan. She studied with Michel Fokine, and he choreographed Salome for her, a performance that was seen only once, because of the censor’s intervention (1909). Although she moved gracefully, Rubinstein’s exceptional beauty apparently far outweighed her dancing talent. Nonetheless, Fokine recommended that Serge Diaghilev use her in the title role of Cleopatra, which opened the Ballet Russes’ first Paris season in 1909. Other cast members included Anna Pavlova and Vaslav Nijinsky. Rubinstein was chosen also for Zobeide in the 1910 production of Scheherazade. The next year, she left Diaghilev’s company and formed her own troupe.
Rubinstein’s many commissions reflected her eye for great art. Among them were Maurice Ravel’s Bolero (1911) and La Valse, both choreographed by Fokine; Claude Debussy’s music for the poet Gabriele D’Annunzio’s The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian (1911), in which she played the title role; The Fairy’s Kiss, with music by Igor Stravinsky, choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska (1928); and Persephone, music by Stravinsky, choreography by Kurt Jooss (1934). In 1924 she danced Léo Staats’ Istar at the Paris Opéra. During this period she turned to serious drama, appearing in title roles such as Camille by Alexandre Dumas fils. Rubinstein’s troupe was most influential during the 1928–29 season. Though she revived the company in 1931 and again in 1934, she gave it up in 1935, retiring in seclusion on the French Riviera, where she lived until 1960. The many famous dancers who appeared with her company included Frederick Ashton, Roman Jasinsky, David Lichine, and Nina Verchinina.
