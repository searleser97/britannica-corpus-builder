Merce Cunningham,  (born April 16, 1919, Centralia, Washington, U.S.—died July 26, 2009, New York, New York), American modern dancer and choreographer who developed new forms of abstract dance movement.
Cunningham began to study dance at 12 years of age. After high school he attended the Cornish School of Fine and Applied Arts in Seattle, Washington, for two years. He subsequently studied at Mills College (1938) with dancer and choreographer Lester Horton and at Bennington College (1939), where he was invited by Martha Graham to join her group. As a soloist for her company, he created many important roles, and his incredible jumps were showcased in Graham’s “El Penitente” (1940), “Letter to the World” (1940), and “Appalachian Spring” (1944).
Encouraged by Graham, Cunningham began to choreograph in 1943. Among his early works were Root of an Unfocus (1944) and Mysterious Adventure (1945). Increasingly involved in a relationship with the composer John Cage, Cunningham started collaborating with him, and in 1944 he presented his first solo concert, with music by Cage. After leaving Graham’s company in 1945, Cunningham worked with Cage on numerous projects. They collaborated on annual recitals in New York City and on a number of works, such as The Seasons (1947) and Inlets (1978). In 1953 Cunningham formed his own dance company.
Like Cage, Cunningham was intrigued by the potential of random phenomena as determinants of structure. Inspired also by the pursuit of pure movement as devoid as possible of emotional implications, Cunningham developed “choreography by chance,” a technique in which selected isolated movements are assigned sequence by such random methods as tossing a coin. The sequential arrangement of the component dances in Sixteen Dances for Soloist and Company of Three (1951) was thus determined, and in Suite by Chance (1953) the movement patterns themselves were so constructed. Suite by Chance was also the first modern dance performed to an electronic score, which was commissioned from American experimental composer Christian Wolff. Symphonie pour un homme seul (1952; later called Collage) was performed to Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry’s composition of the same name and was the first performance in the United States of musique concrète, or music constructed from tape-recorded environmental sounds.
Cunningham’s abstract dances vary greatly in mood but are frequently characterized by abrupt changes and contrasts in movement. Many of his works have been associated with Dadaist, Surrealist, and Existentialist motifs. In 1974 Cunningham abandoned his company’s repertory, which had been built over a 20-year period, for what he called “Events,” excerpts from old or new dances, sometimes two or more simultaneously. Choreography created expressly for videotape, which included Blue Studio: Five Segments (1975–76), was still another innovation. He also began working with film and created Locale (1979). Later dances included Duets (1980), Fielding Sixes (1980), Channels/Inserts (1981), and Quartets (1982).
When arthritis seriously began to disrupt his dancing in the early 1990s, Cunningham turned to a special animated computer program, DanceForms, to explore new choreographic possibilities. Although he left the performance stage soon after Cage died in 1992, he continued to lead his dance company until shortly before his own death. In 2005 he received the Japan Art Association’s Praemium Imperiale prize for theatre/film. To mark Cunningham’s 90th birthday, the Brooklyn Academy of Music premiered his new and last work, Nearly Ninety, in April 2009. His career was the subject of the documentary Cunningham (2019).
