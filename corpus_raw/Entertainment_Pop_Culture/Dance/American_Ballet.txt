American Ballet,  company founded in conjunction with the School of American Ballet in 1934 by Lincoln Kirstein and Edward Warburg, with George Balanchine as artistic director. Its initial performances were held in 1934 in Hartford, Conn., U.S. In 1935 it became the resident ballet company for the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, whose disapproval of Balanchineâ€™s unconventional choreography caused the ballet company to disband temporarily in 1938.
Ballet Caravan, founded by Kirstein in 1936 to produce works by young American choreographers, presented many American Ballet dancers in the early works of Eugene Loring, Lew Christensen, and William Dollar. The company toured the United States in 1938. Its dancers rejoined the American Ballet, renamed the American Ballet Caravan, in 1941 for a government-sponsored tour of South America. After the tour the companies were disbanded, but they formed the nucleus for the founding of the New York City Ballet (q.v.) in 1946 (then called Ballet Society). The School of American Ballet continued to be a creative centre of American ballet as a part of the latter company.
