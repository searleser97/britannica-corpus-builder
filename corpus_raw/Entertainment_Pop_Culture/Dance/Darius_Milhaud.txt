Darius Milhaud,  (born Sept. 4, 1892, Aix-en-Provence, France—died  June 22, 1974, Geneva, Switz.), a principal French composer of the 20th century known especially for his development of polytonality (simultaneous use of different keys).
Born of a Provençal Jewish family, Milhaud studied under Paul Dukas and Vincent d’Indy at the Paris Conservatory. He was grouped by the critic Henri Collet with the young composers whom Collet called Les Six. In 1940 he became professor at Mills College, Oakland, Calif. After 1947 he taught at the Paris Conservatory. In his later years he suffered from crippling arthritis, but he continued to compose and conduct.
Milhaud’s bold, individual style is especially exemplified in the ballets L’Homme et son désir (1918; Man and His Desire; scenario, Paul Claudel), Le Boeuf sur le toit (1919; The Nothing-Doing Bar; scenario, Jean Cocteau), and La Création du monde (1923; The Creation of the World; scenario, Blaise Cendrars). He composed the incidental music for Claudel’s Protée (1920) and for Claudel’s translations of the Aeschylean tragedies Agamemnon (1913), Choéphores (1915), and Les Euménides (1917–22). Whips and hammers are introduced into the orchestration of this trilogy, a work of great dramatic force, in which the chorus is required to groan, whistle, and shriek. His other operas include Christophe Colomb (1930; text by Claudel); Le Pauvre Matelot (1926; The Poor Sailor; text by Cocteau), David (1954), and Médée (1939).
From about 1913, Milhaud’s music is characterized by his use of bitonality and polychords. He was the first to analyze (though not the first to use) polytonality and to develop that technique consistently. An example of his use of polytonality is Saudades do Brasil (1921), a set of dance suites. His style became simplified in later years, but its harmonic basis remained mostly polytonal. The effect of his polytonality is that of simultaneous movement of different planes of sound. Although dissonant, his music retains a lyrical quality.
A prolific composer, Milhaud wrote more than 400 works, including radio and motion-picture scores, a setting of the Jewish Sabbath Morning Service (1947), symphonies (eight for large orchestra, five for small orchestra), choral works, and the two-piano suite Scaramouche (1936; later arranged for saxophone or clarinet and orchestra). His chamber music includes a suite for violin, clarinet, and piano (1936), and 18 string quartets (1912–50). Among his songs are settings of poems by Claudel, Christina Rossetti, and Stéphane Mallarmé. He wrote an autobiography, My Happy Life (1995, trans. by Donald Evans).
