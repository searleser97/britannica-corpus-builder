Giddha, also spelled Giḍḍa,  traditional pastoral dance performed by women of the Punjab, India, and Pakistan at festival times and at the sowing and reaping of the harvest. Patterned on a circle, it is notable for the bodily grace of the women’s movements (especially of the arms and hands) and for the charming melody that accompanies it.
