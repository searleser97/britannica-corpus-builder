Clog dance,  kind of dance in which the dancer accentuates the rhythm of his feet by wearing wooden-soled shoes, or clogs. Clog dancing appears in many dance forms—e.g., in some bourrées of Auvergne, in Swiss Ländler, and often in Irish step dances (solo jigs, reels, and hornpipes). In northern England, notably among the miners of Northumbria and Durham, dances such as the Lancashire and Liverpool hornpipes may be danced on tabletops, in clogs. Like Irish step dancers, English clog dancers maintain an expressionless face and motionless torso and arms; the dance focuses on the feet as they beat complex rhythms. In the United States, English and Irish clog dancing influenced the development of tap dance.
