Arnold Haskell, in full Arnold Lionel Haskell,  (born July 19, 1903, London, England—died November 14, 1980, Bath), British ballet critic who was influential in promoting ballet, especially as a cofounder of the Camargo Society and as a director of the Royal Ballet School.
Haskell studied law at the University of Cambridge (1924), but, while convalescing in Paris, he met some leading Russian dancers who rekindled his early love for dance. In 1930 Haskell and other interested parties formed the Camargo Society, dedicated to the advancement of British ballet. Haskell described his enthusiasm for ballet as “balletomania” and used that neologism as the title of his best-known book, which was published in 1934. Haskell became the first ballet critic appointed by a British newspaper when he joined The Daily Telegraph in 1935. He founded the Royal Ballet Benevolent Fund in 1936 and directed the Royal Ballet School from 1946 to 1965. In recognition of his important contribution to dance, Haskell was made chevalier of the Legion of Honour (1950) and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE; 1954).
His writings include a study of sculptor Jacob Epstein (The Sculptor Speaks), a popular paperback introduction to ballet (An Introduction to Ballet Since 1939), and two volumes of autobiography. Haskell also contributed to the article on dance in the 14th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica.
