Yuri Grigorovich, in full Yuri Nikolayevich Grigorovich,  (born January 2, 1927, Leningrad [now St. Petersburg], Russia, Soviet Union), Russian dancer and choreographer who was artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet from 1964 to 1995.
Grigorovich graduated from the Leningrad Choreographic School in 1946 and joined the Kirov (now Mariinsky) Ballet, specializing in demi-caractère roles. He is best known, however, as a choreographer. The Stone Flower (1957) was one of his earliest successes at the Kirov, and two years later he remounted it for the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. In 1962 Grigorovich became the Kirov’s ballet master; two years later he was appointed chief choreographer and artistic director of the Bolshoi. Grigorovich’s productions at the Bolshoi included The Sleeping Beauty (1965), The Nutcracker (1966), Spartacus (1968), Swan Lake (1969), Ivan the Terrible (1975), and Angara (1976).
Grigorovich was named People’s Artist of the Russian S.F.S.R. (1966), and he received the Lenin Prize (1970) and the State Prize (1977). He was also the editor in chief of the Encyclopedia of Ballet. In 1995 Grigorovich was forced to resign his post with the Bolshoi amidst charges that he had allowed the company to become artistically stagnant during the last decade of his long tenure. However, in 2008 he returned to the Bolshoi, serving as a choreographer.
