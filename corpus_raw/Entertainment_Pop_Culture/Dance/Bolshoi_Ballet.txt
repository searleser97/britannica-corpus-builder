Bolshoi Ballet, also spelled Bolshoy Ballet,   (Russian: “Great Ballet”), leading ballet company of Russia (and the Soviet Union), famous for elaborately staged productions of the classics and children’s ballets that preserve the traditions of 19th-century classical dance. The Bolshoi Ballet took that name in 1825, when the new Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow took over the ballet company of its predecessor, the Petrovsky Theatre, which had been established in 1776. The company’s style, later called “the Moscow style,” gradually emerged, more spontaneous and influenced by Russian folklore than the traditional style that was the hallmark of the St. Petersburg companies.
Throughout the 19th century, such prominent choreographers as Marius Petipa, Carlo Blasis, and Arthur Saint-Léon staged productions at the Bolshoi Theatre. After a period of decline at the end of the 19th century, Aleksandr Gorsky was appointed maître de ballet in 1900. He once again shaped a first-rate company and introduced the realism in scenery and costume that has since characterized the group’s productions. By the 1960s the Bolshoi Ballet was one of the world’s foremost ballet companies. Yuri Grigorovich was the company’s artistic director from 1964 to 1995. The Bolshoi ballet school has officially been known since 1961 as the Moscow Academic Choreographic School.
