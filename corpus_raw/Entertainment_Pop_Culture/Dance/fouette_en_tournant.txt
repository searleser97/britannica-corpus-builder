Fouetté en tournant,   (French: “whipped turning”), spectacular turn in ballet, usually performed in series, during which the dancer turns on one foot while making fast outward and inward thrusts of the working leg at each revolution. After a preparatory turn in place on one leg, the dancer bends the knee of the supporting leg and extends the working leg out straight to the side (second position, en l’air). The dancer then brings the working leg in so that the toe touches the knee of the supporting leg for the turn. The turn is executed on the ball of the foot (demi-pointe) or toe (pointe: women only). Modern choreographers may require as many as 32 fouettés en tournant.
