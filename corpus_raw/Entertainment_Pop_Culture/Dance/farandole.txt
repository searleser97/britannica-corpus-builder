Farandole,  lively and popular chain dance—an ancient dance style in which dancers form a chain, usually by linking hands with two others—of Provence (France) and Catalonia (Spain). The dancers, following the steps introduced by the chain leader, wind through the streets to the accompaniment of pipes and tabors. The music is in 6/8 time. The farandole is one of a group of Mediterranean, Balkan, and Middle Eastern chain dances that includes the Greek syrtos, and it is related to the medieval carole. The dance of the French Revolution, the carmagnole, was a variety of farandole.
