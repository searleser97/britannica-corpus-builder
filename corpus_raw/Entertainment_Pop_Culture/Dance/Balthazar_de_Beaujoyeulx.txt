Balthazar de Beaujoyeulx, also spelled Balthasar De Beaujoyeux, Italian Baltazarini Di Belgioioso,  (born 16th century, Piedmont region, Italy—died 1587, Paris, France), composer and choreographer who influenced the development of theatrical dance and opera.
In 1555 the Duke de Brissac brought Beaujoyeulx to the French court of Queen Catherine de Médicis as a violinist. He became valet de chambre to the royal family and unofficially arranged court festivals.
For the marriage of the Queen’s sister, Marguerite de Lorraine, to the Duke de Joyeuse, Beaujoyeulx staged the Ballet comique de la reine, a 5 1/2-hour spectacle costing 3,600,000 gold francs. Presented on Oct. 15, 1581, the ballet portrayed the vanquishing of Circe by the King of France. Considered the first ballet of which there is a complete printed account, it included poetry, spoken dialogue, singing, and orchestral music as well as dance. Beaujoyeulx’s choreography, performed by members of the court, incorporated overall structural patterns and a geometric arrangement of the dancers; these innovations contributed to the development of theatrical dance. As a precursor of opera, which developed about 20 years later in Italy, the work was unique among court entertainments in that it was unified by a plot. It also contained passages of sung recitative accompanied by simple chords, a style fully developed (with more emotional power) in the early Italian operas.
Although its tremendous cost prohibited repeat performances of the Ballet comique de la reine, imitative and similar ballets were later produced, particularly after the publication of the ballet’s libretto in 1582. Its impact was diplomatic as well as aesthetic, and monarchs of other lands hastened to emulate it with lavish court ballets of their own that, a century later, would metamorphose into the beginnings of professional ballet.
