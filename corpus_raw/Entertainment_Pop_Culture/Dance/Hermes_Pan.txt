Hermes Pan, original name Hermes Panagiotopolous,  (born 1910?, Memphis, Tenn., U.S.—died  Sept. 19, 1990, Beverly Hills, Calif.), U.S. choreographer of dazzling motion picture dance sequences, especially in his work with Fred Astaire.
The son of a Greek consul in Memphis, Pan was inspired by black dancers in his home town. He began collaborating with Astaire during rehearsals for Flying Down to Rio in 1933, and the two remained friends until Astaire’s death. He choreographed 9 of the 10 famed Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals, including The Gay Divorcee (1934), Roberta (1935), Top Hat (1935), Swing Time (1936), and The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939). He won an Academy Award in 1937 for his dance direction in Damsel in Distress, which featured Astaire in a “fun house” comic segment, battling treadmills, revolving barrels, slides, and distorting mirrors.
Besides choreographing approximately 50 films, Pan, who had an uncanny resemblance to Astaire, himself danced in such motion pictures as Moon over Miami (1941), My Gal Sal (1942), and Kiss Me, Kate (1953). In 1961 he won an Emmy award for choreographing the special television program Astaire Time: An Evening with Fred Astaire.
