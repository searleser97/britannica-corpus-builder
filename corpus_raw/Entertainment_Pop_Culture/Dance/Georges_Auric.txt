Georges Auric,  (born Feb. 15, 1899, Lodève, France—died  July 24, 1983, Paris), French composer best known for his film scores and ballets. In these and other works, he was among those who reacted against the chromatic harmonic language and Symbolist structures of Claude Debussy.
Auric studied under Vincent d’Indy and Albert Roussel in Paris, and in 1920 the critic Henri Collet included him in the group he called Les Six, young French composers under the informal patronage of Erik Satie and Jean Cocteau. Auric wrote music criticism for the periodicals Marianne, Paris-Soir, and Nouvelles Littéraires and was artistic director of the Paris Opéra and Opéra-Comique (1962–68).
Auric’s works are characterized by a type of musical irony, mingling popular tunes with sophisticated harmony. His most notable compositions are the ballet Les Matelots (1925; “The Sailors”) and his film scores for René Clair’s À nous la liberté! (1931) and for the film biography of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Moulin Rouge (1952), which included the popular hit “Where Is Your Heart?” (“The Song from Moulin Rouge”). Auric’s other works include an “overture” for orchestra (1938), songs, chamber music, and music for ballets produced by Serge Diaghilev, Jean-Louis Barrault, and Cocteau.
