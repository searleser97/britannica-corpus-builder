Gyula Harangozó, Hungarian form Harangozó Gyula,  (born April 19, 1908, Budapest, Hung.—died Oct. 30, 1974, Budapest), one of the founders of the Hungarian National Ballet and an exceptional dancer of the ballet d’action, or dramatic ballet.
Harangozó began his career at the Hungarian National Ballet, the ballet company of the Hungarian State Opera. In 1928 a visiting choreographer, Albert Gubier, cast him in the main role of Manuel de Falla’s ballet El sombrero de tres picos (“The Three-Cornered Hat”). The immense success of this performance led to Harangozó’s career as a solo dancer. In 1936 he choreographed his first dances, in Csárdajelenet (“Scene in a Wayside Inn”), to the music of Jenö Hubay. This was followed by a number of performances in one-act dramatic ballets that included Aleksandr Borodin’s Polovtsian Dances, Alfredo Casella’s The Jar, and Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov’s Scheherazade. Some of his most important roles were Mirígy in Csongor és Tünde (“Csongor and Tünde”), Coppelius in Coppélia, and Florestan in Karnevál (“Carnival”). However, his most renowned performance was in the role of the old cavalier in love in Béla Bartók’s A csodálatos mandarin (“The Miraculous Mandarin”), which Harangozó choreographed himself.
It was his many characteristically Hungarian dance works—including Pozsonyi majális (“May Dance in Pozsony”), A furfangos diákok (“The Crafty Students”), and A keszkenő (“The Handkerchief”)—and his three-act ballet Ludas Matyi (1960), written to music by Ferenc Szabó, that earned him an international reputation. From 1950 to 1960 he was artistic director of the Hungarian National Ballet. In 1956 he was awarded the Kossuth Prize.
