La Fontaine, also called Mlle de Lafontaine,  (born 1655—died  1738), French ballerina and the first woman professional ballet dancer.
Before La Fontaine’s debut in 1681 at the Paris Opéra as première danseuse in Jean-Baptiste Lully’s ballet Le Triomphe de l’amour, girls’ roles on the public stage had been taken by young men. Although hampered by the long, confining costumes and limited ballet technique of the time, La Fontaine’s grace and charm were such that she was called queen of the dance. After dancing at the Opéra for about a decade, in such works as Persée, Amadis, Didon, and Le Temple de la paix, she retired to a convent.
