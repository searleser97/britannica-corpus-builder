Maris-Rudolf Eduardovich Liepa,  (born July 27, 1936, Riga, Latvia—died  March 25, 1989, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.), Soviet ballet dancer who performed with the Bolshoi Ballet for more than 20 years.
Liepa studied in Riga and at the Bolshoi ballet school (in 1961 renamed the Moscow Academic Choreographic School). He performed with the Riga Ballet (1955–56) and the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchencko Music Theatre (1956–60) before becoming the principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet (1960–81). From 1963 he also taught in the Choreographic School. Liepa danced the romantic leading roles in such classical ballets as Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, Don Quixote, and Giselle, as well as in his own 1967 revival of Le Spectre de la rose. He was admired for his portrayal of the evil Crassus in a 1968 production of Aram Khachaturian’s Spartacus, which won him the Lenin Prize in 1970. Liepa appeared on television and film, wrote several books on dance, and directed the Bulgarian National Ballet.
