Dorothy Alexander, née Dorothea Sydney Moses,  (born April 22, 1904, Atlanta, Ga., U.S.—died Nov. 17, 1986, Atlanta), American ballet dancer and choreographer, founder of the Atlanta Ballet, and pioneer of the regional ballet movement.
Alexander began dancing after recovering from a childhood attack of osteomyelitis. She received degrees from Atlanta Normal Training School (1925) and Oglethorpe College (1930). She took dance classes in New York, London, and Atlanta, where she opened the studio La Petite École de Dance (1921), now the Atlanta School of Ballet, and established dance courses in the Atlanta public schools (1927). With these programs she trained dancers for the Dorothy Alexander Concert Group (1929) and the Dance Art Group (c. 1935), which were consolidated into the Atlanta Civic Ballet (1941), later renamed the Atlanta Ballet (c. 1968). She led the ballet company, the country’s oldest civic ballet, as artistic director and principal choreographer until her retirement in the mid-1960s. For Atlanta’s bicentennial celebration in 1933, she wrote and staged Heirs of All the Ages, using 3,000 performers.
To meet the problem that ballet was largely limited to the nation’s metropolitan centres, Alexander hosted the first regional ballet festival (1956) with Anatole Chujoy, the founder and editor-publisher of Dance News. The festival brought together several companies from the southeastern United States and served as a model for subsequent regional festivals. These nationwide events eventually led to the formation of the National Association for Regional Ballet (1963), of which Alexander was appointed first president.
