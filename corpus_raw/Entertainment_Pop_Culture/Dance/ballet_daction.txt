Ballet d’action,   ballet in which all the elements of production (e.g., choreography, set design, and costuming) are subordinate to the plot and theme. John Weaver, an English ballet master of the early 18th century, is considered the originator of pantomime ballet, a drama in dance form that became formalized as the classical ballet d’action later in the century. The choreographers Angiolini, Franz Hilverding, van Wewen, and especially Noverre became its advocates. Noverre’s Lettres sur la danse, et sur les ballets (1760) is the authoritative work on the ballet d’action.
