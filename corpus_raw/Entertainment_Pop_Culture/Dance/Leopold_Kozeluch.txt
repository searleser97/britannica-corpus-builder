Leopold Koželuch, in full Leopold Anton Koželuch, Koželuch also spelled Kotzeluch,  (born Dec. 9, 1752, Velvary, Bohemia [now in Czech Republic]—died  May 7, 1818, Vienna, Austria), Czech composer of ballets, operas, and symphonies.
Koželuch studied composition in Prague with his uncle Jan Koželuch and piano with F. Dussek and became known as a composer of ballets in the 1770s. In 1778 he went to Vienna, where he became a fashionable piano teacher. Koželuch refused the post of court organist at Salzburg vacated by Mozart in 1781 (it went to Michael Haydn instead), but he succeeded Mozart as court composer in Vienna in 1792. His compositions also include approximately 50 piano concerti, sonatas, and arrangements of Scottish songs for the Edinburgh collector George Thomson. His success as a pianist and teacher contributed substantially to the rapid displacement of the harpsichord by the piano in Vienna, even before Mozart settled there.
