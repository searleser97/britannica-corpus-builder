Willam Christensen, original name William Farr Christensen,  (born August 27, 1902, Brigham City, Utah, U.S.—died October 14, 2001, Salt Lake City, Utah), American dancer, choreographer, and teacher who, along with his brothers, Harold and Lew, established the San Francisco Ballet Company.
Christensen studied with the great ballet master and reformer Michel Fokine. He performed in vaudeville with his brothers before joining the San Francisco Opera Ballet as soloist (1937) and choreographer (1938–58). In 1937 he founded the San Francisco Ballet Company, which staged the first full-length versions of Coppélia (1939), Swan Lake (1940), and The Nutcracker (1944) in the United States.
Becoming a professor of theatre ballet at the University of Utah (1951), Christensen organized a department of ballet and choreography, established an annual campus Ballet Gala with guest artists (1955), and founded the Utah Ballet (1952). In 1963 the company turned professional, and in 1968 it changed its name to Ballet West. Christensen retired as director a decade later and was succeeded by Bruce Marks. As a choreographer, Christensen created works to music by J.S. Bach, Felix Mendelssohn, Igor Stravinsky, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Darius Milhaud.
