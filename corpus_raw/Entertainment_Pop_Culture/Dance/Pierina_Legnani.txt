Pierina Legnani,  (born 1863, Italy—died  1923, Italy), Italian ballerina whose virtuoso technique inspired Russian dancers to develop their now-characteristic technical brilliance.
After appearing in Milan, Paris, London, and Madrid, Legnani went in 1893 to the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, where she danced Cinderella and astonished audiences with 32 consecutive fouettés en tournant (“whipped turns” done in place and on one leg), a tour de force that she originated and first performed in London. Though initially engaged for one season only, Legnani performed in Russia until 1901 and received the title prima ballerina assoluta, an honour awarded by the Imperial Ballet to only one other dancer, Mathilde Kschessinska.
Legnani created the dual role of Odette-Odile in the Petipa-Ivanov version of Swan Lake (1895) and also danced Coppélia, Blue Beard, and Raymonda. After leaving Russia, Legnani performed until about 1910 in Italy, France, and London.
