Lucile Grahn, original name in full Lucina Alexia Grahn,  (born June 30, 1819, Copenhagen, Denmark—died April 4, 1907, Munich, Germany), ballerina, ballet mistress, and choreographer who was the first Danish ballerina to attain international renown.
Grahn received her training at the Royal Danish Theatre School in Copenhagen, where her principal teacher was the ballet master August Bournonville. She made her official debut in 1834, and the following year she created the leading role in his Valdemar (1835). Bournonville took her to Paris in 1834 specifically to see Marie Taglioni in La Sylphide, and upon their return to Copenhagen he produced his own version, in which Grahn appeared in 1836. In 1837 she danced as Quitteria in his Don Quixote. Differences then soured their relationship, and she went to Paris, where she made a successful debut at the Paris Opéra in 1838.
In 1839 Grahn broke free of her commitment to the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen and was engaged at the Opéra. This marked the beginning of her international career. Although an injury cut short her appearances in Paris, her success there enabled her to obtain an engagement in St. Petersburg, where she appeared in both La Sylphide and Giselle in 1843. Later that year she danced at La Scala in Milan, and in 1844 she made her first appearance in London at Drury Lane Theatre. In 1845 she performed at London’s Her Majesty’s Theatre, where the ballet master Jules Perrot, then at the peak of his creative powers, was engaged. For her London debut he staged Eoline (1845), in which Grahn created the title role of Eoline, a wood nymph. This production was followed by Kaya (1845), and Grahn made a significant, but anonymous, contribution to the choreography in addition to creating the principal role. London was at that time the favourite haunt of stars of the ballet, and the 1845 season culminated with Perrot’s extraordinary Pas de quatre in which Grahn shared the stage with Taglioni, Fanny Cerrito, and Carlotta Grisi. In 1846 Grahn opened the season in Perrot’s new dramatic ballet, Catarina, and she was later featured in Le Jugement de Pâris (1846), another of his divertissements that featured many well-known dancers.
After 1846 Grahn’s career took on a new dimension. She began to tour Europe as a celebrity in her own right, not only dancing but also frequently producing the ballets in which she appeared. In a tour of Italy in 1846–47 she staged versions of major ballets, including Catarina, as well as presenting Bacchus et Ariadne, an original work of her own; in 1849 she reproduced Perrot’s La Esmeralda in Berlin.
In 1856 Grahn retired from the stage and married the Austrian tenor Friedrich Young. From 1858 to 1861 she worked as ballet mistress in Leipzig, Germany, and from 1869 to 1875 she was ballet mistress and head of the ballet school at the Court Opera in Munich, Germany. There she reproduced a number of ballets and also worked with the German composer Richard Wagner on the production of several of his operas, including Tannhäuser (1873), for which she arranged the bacchanal. She died in Munich in 1907, leaving a very substantial legacy to the city, which honoured her memory by naming a street after her.
