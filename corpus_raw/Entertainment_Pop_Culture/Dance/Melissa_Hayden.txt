Melissa Hayden, original name Mildred Herman,  (born April 25, 1923, Toronto, Ont., Can.—died Aug. 9, 2006, Winston-Salem, N.C., U.S.), Canadian-born ballet dancer, whose technical and dramatic skills shone in the many and various roles she created.
Hayden began studying dance while a schoolgirl. In 1945 she went to New York City and found a position in the corps de ballet at Radio City Music Hall. Within a few months she had been accepted by the Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre) company, in which she rose rapidly to the rank of soloist. In 1949 she joined the New York City Ballet (NYCB) under George Balanchine and attracted high critical praise in her debut there in The Duel (1950). Among her other notable performances were those in Todd Bolender’s The Miraculous Mandarin (1951), Jerome Robbins’s The Pied Piper 1951, Balanchine’s Caracole (1952), and Robbins’s The Cage (1952). In 1952 she appeared in the Charlie Chaplin film Limelight.
Following a brief return to Ballet Theatre (1953–54), Hayden left the stage for nearly a year before rejoining NYCB, where she remained until her retirement. During that time she made acclaimed appearances in Balanchine’s Ivesiana (1955), in Bolender’s Still Point (1956), and in numerous premieres of Balanchine’s works, including Divertimento No. 15 (1956; a longer version of Caracole), Agon (1957), Stars and Stripes (1958), A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1962), and Cortège hongroise (1973), which was created for her as a farewell tribute. Hayden, who was noted for her stamina and professionalism, was a frequent guest star with the National Ballet of Canada, the Royal Ballet of London, and other companies. Her final performance was in 1973.
Upon her retirement Hayden became a teacher, and she later established a dance school in New York City, where she served as artistic director from 1977 to 1983.  In 1983 she began teaching at the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem and remained there until shortly before her death. Hayden published several books, including Dancer to Dancer (1981), which offered practical advice to dancers based on her own experiences, and The Nutcracker Ballet (1992), a retelling of the classic ballet for young readers. She also wrote an autobiography, Melissa Hayden—Off Stage and On (1963).
