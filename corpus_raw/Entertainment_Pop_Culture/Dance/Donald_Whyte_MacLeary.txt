Donald MacLeary, in full Donald Whyte MacLeary,  (born August 22, 1937, Glasgow, Scotland), Scottish premier danseur noted for his strong finesse and natural romanticism.
He was trained at the Royal Ballet School and joined the company in 1954. He was promoted in the next year to soloist, becoming, in 1959, the youngest premier danseur of the Royal Ballet. In partnership principally with Svetlana Beriosova, MacLeary danced classical leads, including those in Swan Lake, La Fille mal gardée, and Romeo and Juliet, and he created major roles in many modern ballets. After retiring in 1975, he became ballet master of the Royal Ballet. In 1979, however, he returned to the stage as a guest dancer, performing with the Scottish Ballet, among other companies. He later served as répétiteur (1981–85) and répétiteur to principal dancers (1985–2002) at the Royal Ballet. He subsequently held various informal posts with different troupes.
