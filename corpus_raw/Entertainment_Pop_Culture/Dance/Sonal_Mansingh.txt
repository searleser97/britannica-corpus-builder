Sonal Mansingh,  (born April 30, 1944, Bombay [now Mumbai], India), dancer of odissi, a classical Indian dance form that originated in Orissa, and other Indian classical forms. Apart from being a dancer, she was also a teacher, researcher, choreographer, and social activist.
Mansingh’s initial lessons in dance were in manipuri and bharata natyam styles as a child. She began her professional dance career in the early 1960s. In 1965 she started training under odissi guru Kelucharan Mohapatra in Cuttack. She did not limit her study, exploring various elements of Oriyan culture and dance forms such as chhau and kuchipudi. She also underwent extensive training in abhinaya (gesture expression). Mansingh was trained in Hindustani and Carnatic classical vocal music and was proficient in the Sanskrit and German languages.
In 1977 she founded the Centre for Indian Classical Dances in Delhi. Her choreography was often rooted in Indian mythology, though she also explored contemporary topics such as women’s issues and environmentalism. Mansingh was often invited to teach and perform internationally and traveled extensively both in India and abroad.
For her work, Mansingh was the recipient of many awards, including the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (1987) and the Padma Bhushan (1992) and Padma Vibhushan (2003), two of India’s highest civilian honours.
