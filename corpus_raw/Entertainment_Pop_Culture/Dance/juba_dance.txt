Juba,   dance of Afro-American slaves, found as late as the 19th century from Dutch Guiana to the Caribbean and the southern United States. It was danced by a circle of men around two men who performed various steps (e.g., the juba, the long dog scratch, the pigeon wing) in response to a rhythmic call and to the clapping (patting juba) of the other dancers. As a refrain, after each new step the circle danced counterclockwise using the juba step. The juba contained features that persist in Afro-American dances, notably improvisation, shuffle steps, supple body movements, and sharp rhythms and was probably related to the African giouba.
“Patting juba”—slapping the hands, legs, and body to produce complex, rapid rhythms—survived the dance and still appears occasionally in areas where the dance had flourished.
