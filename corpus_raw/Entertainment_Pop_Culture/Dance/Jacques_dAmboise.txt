Jacques d’Amboise, original name Joseph Jacques Ahearn,  (born July 28, 1934, Dedham, Massachusetts, U.S.—died May 2, 2021, New York, New York), American dancer and choreographer of the New York City Ballet (1949–84), admired for his energetic virile interpretations of both character and classical roles.
Trained principally by George Balanchine’s School of American Ballet, he made his professional debut at the age of 12 with the Ballet Society and at 15 joined the New York City Ballet. After his acrobatic performance in 1953 as Mac, the gas station attendant and all-American hero of Lew Christensen’s Filling Station, d’Amboise was promoted to soloist. He created important roles in Western Symphony (1954), Stars and Stripes (1958), Meditation (1964), and Who Cares? (1970), establishing himself as a technically skillful character dancer. His repertoire eventually included roles ranging from the princes of Swan Lake and The Nutcracker to the title role in Apollo and the creation (1958) of a leading role in the abstract Gounod Symphony.
D’Amboise also was featured in the films Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), The Best Things in Life Are Free (1956), Carousel (1956), and Off Beat (1986) and appeared on Broadway in the musical comedy Shinbone Alley (1957). As a choreographer, his works included The Chase (1963), Quatuor (1964), and Irish Fantasy (1964).
D’Amboise taught at the School of American Ballet, served as professor and dean of the school of dance at the State University of New York, and then became director of the nonprofit National Dance Institute (NDI), which he founded (1976) in order to take the teaching of dance into an ever-widening circle of public schools. The NDI, which was based in New York City, later became involved with a number of associate organizations across the country. D’Amboise’s work with the institute was the focus of He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin’ (1983), which won an Academy Award for best feature documentary.
D’Amboise was the recipient of numerous awards, including a Kennedy Center Honor (1995) and a National Medal of Arts (1998).
