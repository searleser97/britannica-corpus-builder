Courante, (French:  “running”) also spelled courant, Italian corrente,  court dance for couples, prominent in the late 16th century and fashionable in aristocratic European ballrooms, especially in France and England, for the next 200 years. It reputedly originated as an Italian folk dance with running steps. As a court dance it was performed with small, back-and-forth, springing steps, later subdued to stately glides. Each couple held hands to move forward and backward or dropped hands to face each other or turn. In its early courtly form the dance was preceded by a wooing pantomime for three couples.
As a musical form the dance appears as the French courante in modern 3/2 (𝅗𝅥𝅗𝅥𝅗𝅥) time with some contrasting measures in 6/4 (♩♩♩♩♩♩) and as the Italian corrente in rapid 3/4 or 3/8 time with running passages of eighth notes. Georg Philipp Telemann, George Frideric Handel, J.S. Bach, and other Baroque composers used both types in their orchestral and keyboard suites. In these suites the courante follows the allemande, as it did in the ballroom. The Italian masters Arcangelo Corelli and Antonio Vivaldi, among others, included corrente movements in their sonate da camera (chamber sonatas).
