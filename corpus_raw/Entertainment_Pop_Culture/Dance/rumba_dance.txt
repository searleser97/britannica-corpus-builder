Rumba, also spelled rhumba,  ballroom dance of Afro-Cuban folk-dance origin that became internationally popular in the early 20th century. Best known for the dancersâ€™ subtle side to side hip movements with the torso erect, the rumba is danced with a basic pattern of two quick side steps and a slow forward step. Three steps are executed to each bar. The music, in 4/4 time, has an insistent syncopation.
The ballroom version is based on the Cuban son, itself a less vigorous form of the uninhibited Cuban rumba danced in taverns and similar places. The word rumba occasionally refers generically to other Cuban dances with similar rhythms.
