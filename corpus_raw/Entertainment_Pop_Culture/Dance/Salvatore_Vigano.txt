Salvatore Viganò,  (born March 25, 1769, Naples, Kingdom of Naples [Italy]—died  Aug. 10, 1821, Milan, Austrian Habsburg domain [Italy]), Italian dancer and choreographer whose innovations included the synthesis of dance and pantomime, which he called “coreodramma,” in highly dramatic ballets based on historical and mythological themes and Shakespearean plays.
Viganò was born of a family of dancers and was the nephew of the composer Luigi Boccherini. He studied literature and music as well as dance. While performing in Madrid he married the Austrian dancer Maria Medina and met the choreographer Jean Dauberval (a pupil and protégé of Jean-Georges Noverre), whom he joined in France and England. Viganò then danced and choreographed in Italy and central Europe, principally Vienna (1793–95 and 1799–1803). In 1811 he went to Milan to become ballet master at La Scala, Italy’s principal opera and ballet theatre. Under his influence, ballet in Italy flourished.
In contrast to many earlier choreographers, Viganò tried to select music for his ballets that was appropriate to their themes and dance movements. In Gli strelizzi (1809) and subsequent ballets, he further developed Noverre’s dance-drama approach by combining conventional dance patterns with pantomime, whereas Noverre had stopped at the alternation of such sequences. Among Viganò’s more than 40 ballets were Die Geschöpfe des Prometheus (1801; The Creatures of Prometheus), composed especially for him by Beethoven; Gli strelizzi, based on an insurrection in the late 17th century among the guards (streltsy) of the Russian tsar Peter the Great; Otello (1818); and I titani (1819; “The Titans”), which explored man’s greed for gold.
