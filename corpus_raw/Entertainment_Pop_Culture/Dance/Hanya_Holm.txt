Hanya Holm, original name Johanna Eckert,  (born March 3, 1893, Worms am Rhein, Ger.—died  Nov. 3, 1992, New York, N.Y., U.S.), German-born American choreographer of modern dance and Broadway musicals.
After early study at the Dalcroze institutes in Frankfurt am Main and Hellerau, she joined Mary Wigman’s Central Institute in Dresden and for several years was chief instructor there. She also danced in and helped choreograph Wigman’s massive Das Totenmal (1930). In 1931 Wigman sent her to the United States to open the Mary Wigman School in New York City, which in 1936 became the Hanya Holm Studio (later the Hanya Holm School of Dance). As a teacher Holm emphasized the importance of both technical expertise and emotional expression. She took U.S. citizenship in 1939.
Holm’s Trend (1937), a large-scale dance of social protest, and another work of social commentary, Tragic Exodus (1939), are among her best-known concert works. In 1939 she became the first concert dancer to present her work on television with the broadcast of her Metropolitan Daily. Holm and her company made many tours in the United States and Europe, and in 1941 she established the Center of Dance in the West in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where she gave annual summer courses for more than 25 years.
Holm choreographed more than a dozen Broadway musicals, including Kiss Me, Kate (1948), Out of This World (1950), My Fair Lady (1956), and Camelot (1960). She was instrumental in promoting the use of dance notation and was also the first choreographer to copyright a dance, submitting a written Labanotation score of her choreography for Kiss Me, Kate, in 1952.
