Emil Waldteufel, in full Charles Emil Waldteufel,  (born Dec. 9, 1837, Strasbourg, France—died  Feb. 12, 1915, Paris), French (Alsatian) pianist and one of the best-known waltz composers of his time.
Born of a musical family, Waldteufel studied with his parents and later at the Paris Conservatory, after which time he worked for a piano manufacturer, gave piano lessons, and played at soirees.
In 1865 he became court pianist to Empress Eugénie and the following year conductor of court balls. With the success of his first waltzes, Waldteufel decided to devote himself entirely to composing dance music, producing some 270 dances, including waltzes, polkas, and galops. Among his famous waltzes are The Skaters, Estudiantina, and Dolores.
