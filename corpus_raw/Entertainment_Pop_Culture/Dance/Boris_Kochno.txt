Boris Kochno,  (born Jan. 3, 1904, Moscow, Russia—died  Dec. 8, 1990, Paris, France), Russian-born writer and ballet librettist who collaborated with ballet impresario Serge Diaghilev during the last years of the Ballets Russes, then became a major influence on post-World War II French ballet.
Kochno studied at the Imperial Lycée in Moscow until the 1917 Russian Revolution, when he and his mother left the country, eventually settling in Paris. Kochno met Diaghilev in 1921 and immediately became his secretary. His first libretto for Diaghilev was the text of Igor Stravinsky’s chamber opera Mavra (1922); he followed it with scenarios for such ballets as Les Fâcheux (1924), Les Matelots (1925), Ode (1928), and Le Fils prodigue (The Prodigal Son, 1929).
After Diaghilev’s death in 1929 Kochno continued advising on ballets. He collaborated on Cotillon and Jeux d’enfants (1932) for the new Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, then, with choreographer George Balanchine, founded the short-lived Les Ballets 1933. He returned to the Ballet Russe, advising the company’s management until 1937. With his longtime friend Christian Bérard, a painter, and choreographer Roland Petit, he collaborated on the ballet Les Forains (1945), which led to the founding of Les Ballets des Champs-Elysées and the renaissance of French ballet; he remained with that company until 1951. He was the author of the books Le Ballet (1954) and Diaghilev et les Ballets Russes (1970).
