Square dance,   dance for four couples (or groups of four couples) standing in square formation, the most popular and widely known type of folk dance in the United States. It was called the square dance to distinguish it from comparable dances called the contra, or longways dance, for a double file of couples, and from the round dance for a circle of couples. Historians trace the origin of the square dance to both the Kentucky running set of English derivation and to the cotillon, a stately French dance in square formation, popular at the court of Louis XV but supplanted later by the quadrille (also a “square” dance).
The Americanized quadrille, or square dance, begins and progresses rapidly in well-ordered patterns within the framework of a relatively compact square, sets of four couples forming its four sides. To the traditional accompaniment of accordion, banjo, fiddle, and guitar and to prompting, patter, and singing calls made by a “caller,” couples perform a variety of movements, all based on a smooth, “shuffling” walk. (Stepwork is less important than the cooperative movement.) Formerly danced in five main figures, the contemporary square dance is composed of three.
