International Ballet Competitions,   one of the world’s most prestigious dance competitions, open to both male and female dancers of all countries, and much like the Olympic Games in purpose. The first International Ballet Competitions were held in Varna, Bulg., in July 1964. The competitions were organized by the Bulgarian Ministry of Culture to sponsor a dance event of international interest, creating opportunities for dancers, choreographers, directors, and teachers to demonstrate and exchange skills. Following the original competitions the next were held in 1965, 1966, 1968, and every two years thereafter. Other sites for the competitions have been Moscow, Tokyo, and Jackson, Miss. There are three rounds to the competitions, all of which are judged by the impartial, designated members of the International Ballet Competitions Rules Committee. Given the political schisms between many of the countries that are represented, however, the decisions of the judges are often disputed. Competitors progress to each round through a process of elimination.
The opening night ceremony is climaxed by the lighting of the competitions’ torch, following which the competitors return to their provided housing and rest for the first round that begins the next day. Traditionally, round one includes performances of classical variations as well as contemporary compulsories, created after 1925. Dancers choose works to perform from among the group of choreographers designated by the Rules Committee. Round two consists of contemporary compulsories created after 1974. In round three there are performances of more classical variations and contemporary pieces. The winners are recognized with gold, silver, or bronze medals at both junior and senior levels. A multitude of great dancers have participated in the competitions, which offered many of them their first international acclaim.
