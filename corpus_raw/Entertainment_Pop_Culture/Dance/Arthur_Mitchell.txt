Arthur Mitchell,  (born March 27, 1934, Harlem, New York, New York, U.S.—died September 19, 2018, Manhattan, New York), American dancer, choreographer, and director who was the first African American to become a principal dancer with a major ballet troupe, New York City Ballet. He later cofounded (1969) Dance Theatre of Harlem.
Mitchell attended the High School for the Performing Arts in New York City and began performing in Broadway musicals and with the companies of Donald McKayle and John Butler. In 1956 Mitchell became the only Black dancer in New York City Ballet. He was promoted to principal dancer with the company in 1962, and George Balanchine created several roles for him, notably those in Agon (1957) and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1962).
Mitchell was sensitive to the prejudice against Blacks in the world of ballet and determined to form an all-Black ballet company. In 1969 he and Karel Shook founded Dance Theatre of Harlem, an integrated school, whose associated company made its debut in 1971 in New York City. Mitchell choreographed a number of ballets for the company before it disbanded in 2004; the troupe was revived in 2012. In 2009 Mitchell stepped down as the school’s artistic director.
