Carlos Surinach,  (born March 4, 1915, Barcelona, Spain—died Nov. 12, 1997, New Haven, Conn., U.S.), Spanish-born American composer, known chiefly for his vibrant ballet scores influenced by traditional flamenco rhythms and melodies.
Surinach was the son of a Spanish stockbroker and an Austrian-Polish pianist. He took piano lessons from his mother until he was 13, and at age 14 he entered the Caminals Academy of Music, where he studied piano and music theory. He studied composition (1936–39) privately with Enrique Morera, director of the Barcelona Municipal Conservatory, under whose direction he composed his earliest works. On Morera’s advice, Surinach went to Germany in 1940, studying in Düsseldorf, Cologne, and Berlin. After a few years he returned to Barcelona, where in 1944 he was made conductor of the Barcelona Philharmonic Orchestra and where he introduced his Passacaglia-Sinfonia in 1945.
In the years that followed, Surinach was guest conductor for a number of symphonies throughout Europe. He went to Paris in 1947 and lived there until 1950. In 1951 he settled in New York City, and he became an American citizen in 1959. Shortly after his arrival in the United States, he began to receive commissions for ballet scores, and he became best known for his works for choreographer Martha Graham, including Embattled Garden (1958), Acrobats of God (1960), and The Owl and the Pussycat (1978). Among his other outstanding ballet pieces are Ritmo jondo (1953; extended version for Deep Rhythm, choreography by Doris Humphrey) and Agathe’s Tale (1967; choreography by Paul Taylor). Characterized by rhythmic power and often based on the eight-tone flamenco scale, Surinach’s compositions—those for the concert stage as well as those for ballet—were much in demand. In addition to composing ballet music, he wrote chamber music, choral music, music for guitar and for piano, and a number of works for orchestra.
