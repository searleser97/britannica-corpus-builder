Albertina Rasch,  (born 1896, Vienna, Austria—died  Oct. 2, 1967, Hollywood, Calif., U.S.), Austrian-born American dancer, choreographer, and teacher whose troupes became well known during the 1920s and ’30s for their appearances in Broadway musicals and Hollywood films.
Rasch, a student of the Vienna Opera ballet school, became leading ballerina at the Hippodrome Theatre in New York City in 1911. In 1923 she opened a ballet school and in 1924 formed the first of several troupes known as the Albertina Rasch Girls. After staging the dances for several of Florenz Ziegfeld’s revues and for George White’s Scandals, she choreographed numerous Broadway musicals, including Three’s a Crowd (1930) and Moss Hart’s Lady in the Dark (1941), as well as a number of motion pictures.
Before Rasch’s influence, dancing in musical plays and films had provided primarily a background for the leading performers; routines were usually simple, with emphasis on spectacular costumes and uniform ensemble dancing. Rasch’s choreography was more closely allied to the dramatic narrative, and, although she continued to use precision dancing, she was among the first on Broadway to include variations for individual ensemble dancers. She incorporated classical ballet technique into precision dancing and helped raise technical standards of stage and film dancing by requiring a ballet background of her dancers.
