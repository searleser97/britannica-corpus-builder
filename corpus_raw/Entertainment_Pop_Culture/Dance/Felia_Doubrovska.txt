Felia Doubrovska, byname of Felizata Dluzhnevska,  (born 1896, St. Petersburg, Russia —died September 18, 1981, New York, New York, U.S.), Russian ballerina who gave critically acclaimed performances as the bride in Igor Stravinsky’s Les Noces (1923; “The Wedding”) and as the siren in Sergey Prokofiev’s The Prodigal Son (1929) while dancing with Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes.
After she graduated from the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, Doubrovska joined the Mariinsky Ballet. In 1920 she became part of Diaghilev’s company in France. Doubrovska earned the admiration of the Ballets Russes’ leading choreographer, George Balanchine, who cast her in a number of his ballets, including Pastorale (1927), The Gods Go a-Begging (1928), and Apollo (1928).
Doubrovska moved to the United States when her husband, the dancer Pierre Vladimiroff, accepted a teaching position at the School of American Ballet in New York City in 1934. Doubrovska taught advanced girls’ classes at the school from 1949 to 1980.
