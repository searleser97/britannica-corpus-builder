Peter Martins,  (born October 27, 1946, Copenhagen, Denmark), Danish dancer and choreographer, known principally for his work with the New York City Ballet.
Martins began his dance training at the Royal Danish Ballet School in 1953, became a corps de ballet member in 1965, and was made a soloist two years later. George Balanchine, artistic director of the New York City Ballet (NYCB), arranged several guest appearances for him with the NYCB, and in 1969 Martins left Denmark to become a principal dancer in Balanchine’s company.
Martins had several roles in dances created for him, among which are Jerome Robbins’s Goldberg Variations (1971) and In G Major (1975) and Balanchine’s Violin Concerto (1972) and Duo Concertante (1972). In 1977 Martins made his debut as a choreographer, creating Calcium Light Night for the NYCB. He subsequently created several other works, including L’Histoire du soldat (1981). In 1982 his autobiography, Far from Denmark, was published. In 1983, shortly before the death of Balanchine, Martins was named director of daily operations and, with Jerome Robbins, ballet master in chief of the NYCB. In January 1990, upon Robbins’s resignation, Martins became sole director of the New York City Ballet. In early 2018 he retired from the company amid allegations of various incidents of misconduct, including sexual harassment. An investigation did not corroborate the accusations.
