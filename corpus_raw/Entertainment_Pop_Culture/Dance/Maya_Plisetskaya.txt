Maya Plisetskaya, in full Maya Mikhaylovna Plisetskaya,  (born November 20, 1925, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.—died May 2, 2015, Munich, Germany), Russian prima ballerina of the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow, admired particularly for her technical virtuosity, expressive use of her arms, and ability to integrate acting with dancing.
Plisetskaya, a niece of the dancers Asaf and Sulamith Messerer, studied with Pavel (or Paul) Gerdt’s daughter Yelizaveta and with Agrippina Yakovlevna Vaganova and graduated from the Bolshoi school in 1943. Plisetskaya was noted for her unique, individualistic portrayals in both Soviet and classic ballets. Her repertory included Zarema in The Fountain of Bakhchisaray; the title role in Laurencia; Mistress of the Copper Mountain in The Stone Flower; Kitri in Don Quixote; Myrtha, Queen of the Wilis, in Giselle; Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty; and the dual character Odette-Odile in Swan Lake, frequently considered her greatest role.
Plisetskaya performed in a number of countries and was a guest artist with the Paris Opéra in 1961 and 1964. Her performances were recorded in the films Stars of the Russian Ballet (1953), Swan Lake (1957), Plisetskaya Dances (1964), Anna Karenina (1975), and Carmen Suite (1978)—in the latter two starring opposite her protégé Alexander Godunov. In 1964 she received a Lenin Prize for outstanding work in the arts. She appeared in ballets by such non-Soviet choreographers as Roland Petit, Maurice Béjart, and Alberto Alonso. From 1975 she also performed with the Ballet du XXe Siècle of Brussels, and she was artistic director of the Rome Opera Ballet (1983–84) and Spain’s National Dance Company (1987–90). Her first choreography was Anna Karenina (1972).
In her 1994 autobiography (Eng. trans. I, Maya Plisetskaya), Plisetskaya discussed her father’s execution under Joseph Stalin, her mother’s subsequent spell in exile, and her own struggle for artistic freedom. She and her husband, composer Rodion Shchedrin, eventually settled in Germany. In 2005 Plisetskaya received Spain’s Prince of Asturias Award for the arts, and the following year she was granted the Japan Art Association’s Praemium Imperiale prize for theatre or film.
