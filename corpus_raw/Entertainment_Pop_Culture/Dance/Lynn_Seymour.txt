Lynn Seymour, original name Berta Lynn Springbett,  (born March 8, 1939, Wainwright, Alberta, Canada), Canadian prima ballerina.
In 1954 Seymour went to England, where she enrolled at the Sadler’s Wells School. She danced with the Covent Garden Opera Ballet (1956) before joining the Royal Ballet in 1957. Two years later she became a principal dancer, subsequently performing as The Bride in Kenneth MacMillan’s Le Baiser de la fée (1960) and The Girl in Les Deux Pigeons (1961). Although the role of Juliet in MacMillan’s Romeo and Juliet was created for her, Dame Margot Fonteyn danced the premiere (1965).
In 1966–69 Seymour performed with the German Opera Ballet in West Berlin, where she collaborated with MacMillan. Returning to the Royal Ballet, she enjoyed one of the greatest successes of her career in the principal role in Sir Frederick Ashton’s A Month in the Country (1976). From 1978 to 1980 Seymour was ballet director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. Although she retired as a dancer in 1981, she occasionally appeared as a guest performer with various ballet companies, and she was cast in the films Dancers (1987) and Wittgenstein (1993). Seymour also worked as a ballet coach and choreographer, and from 2006 to 2007 she was artistic director of the Greek National Opera Ballet. Her autobiography, Lynn (cowritten with Paul Gardner), was published in 1984.
