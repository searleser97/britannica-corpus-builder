Paris Opéra Ballet,  ballet company established in France in 1661 by Louis XIV as the Royal Academy of Dance (Académie Royale de Danse) and amalgamated with the Royal Academy of Music in 1672. As part of the Théâtre National de l’Opéra, the company dominated European theatrical dance of the 18th and early 19th centuries. Its artists developed the basic techniques of classical ballet: Pierre Beauchamp, the company’s first director, codified the five basic ballet positions, and the virtuosos Jean Balon, Louis Duport, Marie Camargo, and Gaetano and Auguste Vestris extended the range of dance steps, especially the jumps and leaps.
In 1832 the company opened the era of Romantic ballet by presenting Filippo Taglioni’s La Sylphide. The company’s dancers of this period included Jules Perrot, Arthur Saint-Léon, Fanny Elssler, and Carlotta Grisi, who created the title role in Giselle at the Paris Opéra in 1841.
The company’s decline at the end of the 19th century was arrested by Jacques Rouché, director of the Paris Opéra and the Opéra-Comique from 1914 to 1944. After the successful avant-garde productions of Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes at the Opéra, Rouché engaged the Russian guest artists Michel Fokine, Anna Pavlova, and Bronisława Nijinska and in 1930 appointed Serge Lifar director of the company. Principal performers under Lifar included Yvette Chauviré, Solange Schwarz, Marjorie Tallchief, Michel Renault, and George Skibine.
