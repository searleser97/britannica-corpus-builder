Cabriole,   ballet jump, formerly performed only by men, in which the dancer beats the calves of the legs together in the air, with a scissors-like movement. When the beat occurs, the legs are extended at either a 45° or 90° angle to the body at the front, side, or back. The dancer may land on one foot, then bring the second foot down to fifth position—cabriole fermée (“closed cabriole”)—or may complete the step with the second foot in the air—cabriole ouverte (“open cabriole”).
