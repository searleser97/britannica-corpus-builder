Natalia Makarova, in full Natalia Romanovna Makarova,  (born October 21, 1940, Leningrad, Russia, U.S.S.R. [now St. Petersburg, Russia]), Russian-born ballerina considered to be one of the greatest classical dancers.
Makarova began her training at the Leningrad Choreographic School at age 12. Upon graduation in 1959 she joined the Kirov (now Mariinsky) Ballet and soon became one of their leading ballerinas. She won a gold medal at the Varna International Ballet Competition in 1965.
While performing with the Kirov in London (1970), Makarova decided to remain in the West and soon joined the American Ballet Theatre in New York City. She also became a guest artist with other companies, notably the Royal Ballet of Great Britain. Makarovaâ€™s magnificent technique and acting sensibilities allowed her to excel in many different roles, although she is perhaps best known for Giselle, the title role of which she danced originally with the Kirov. In 1980, disappointed that Mikhail Baryshnikov had become director of the American Ballet Theatre and not she, Makarova formed her own group, Makarova and Company, which lasted only a season. Though hampered by a knee injury, Makarova continued to dance with the American Ballet Theatre.
In 1983 Makarova made her Broadway debut in On Your Toes, where she earned a Tony Award for her acting. The following year she reprised her role for the British stage and won a Laurence Olivier Award (1985). After reuniting with the Kirov for several performances in the late 1980s, Makarova focused on her acting career. Her memoir, A Dance Autobiography, was published in 1979. She was named a Kennedy Center honoree in 2012.
