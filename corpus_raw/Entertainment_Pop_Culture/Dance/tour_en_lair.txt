Tour en l’air,   (French: “turn in the air”), in ballet, a complete single, double, or triple turn in the air, usually beginning from and ending in the fifth position (the feet are turned out and pressed closely together, the heel of the right foot against the toe of the left and vice versa). Performed almost exclusively by male dancers, it is usually a brilliant display linked by softer, less spectacular movements that require great style and control.
