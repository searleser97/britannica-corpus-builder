Martha Clarke,  (born June 3, 1944, Baltimore, Md., U.S.),  American choreographer and dancer whose emotionally evocative work draws extensively on theatrical elements.
Clarke studied at the exclusive Perry-Mansfield School of Theater and Dance in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. She attended summer sessions at the Connecticut College School of Dance, where she worked with José Límon and Alvin Ailey. At the Juilliard School in New York City she studied the Martha Graham technique and then joined the modern dance company of Anna Sokolow, under whose direction Clarke tapped what she later described as an emotional expressionism evident in all her subsequent work.
Clarke joined the Pilobolus Dance Theatre, a previously all-male acrobatic troupe, in 1973; intense competition and discord between members caused her to leave the group in 1979. With Robert Barnett and Félix Blaska, Clarke then formed Crowsnest, a chamber group. Her dramatic and imaginative solos—such as Fallen Angel, in which, clad in an evening gown and bird mask, she danced to a Gregorian chant—were highly praised. She worked with actress Linda Hunt on performance art pieces, including A Metamorphosis in Miniature (1982), a musical adaptation of Franz Kafka’s Metamorphosis. In 1984 Clarke created a phantasmagoric series of sketches called The Garden of Earthly Delights, based on the work of the 15th-century surrealist painter Hieronymus Bosch. Her other works include Vienna: Lusthaus, which evokes the decadence of fin de siècle Europe; The Hunger Artist, about the life of Kafka; and Miracolo d’amore, an exploration of erotic love.
Clarke was the subject of Martha Clarke, Light and Dark: A Dancer’s Journey, a 1981 Public Broadcasting Service documentary. She also was the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation fellowship.
