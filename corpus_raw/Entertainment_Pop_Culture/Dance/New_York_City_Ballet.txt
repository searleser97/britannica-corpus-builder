New York City Ballet, formerly (1946–48) Ballet Society,  resident ballet company of the New York State Theatre at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. The company, first named Ballet Society, was founded in 1946 by the choreographer George Balanchine (artistic director) and Lincoln Kirstein (general director) as a private subscription organization to promote lyric theatre. It is a descendant of the American Ballet company. In 1948 Ballet Society gave its first public performance at the Center Theater of the New York City Center of Music and Drama and changed the company’s name to the New York City Ballet. From 1950 its prestige grew with foreign tours. It was moved to its present home in 1964. The company performs during summer sessions at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga, New York.
In addition to ballets choreographed by Balanchine, the company performed works by the choreographers Jerome Robbins (ballet master 1969–90), William Dollar, Todd Bolender, Francisco Moncion, Lew Christensen, and Sir Frederick Ashton. Its principal dancers have included Maria Tallchief, Tanaquil LeClercq, Melissa Hayden, Patricia Wilde, Violette Verdy, Suzanne Farrell, Gelsey Kirkland, Patricia McBride, Helene Alexopoulos, André Eglevsky, Jacques d’Amboise, Edward Villella, and Peter Martins.
After the death of Balanchine in 1983, Robbins and Martins shared the responsibilities of ballet master. Robbins retired in 1990, and Martins continued in his charge until 2018, when he retired amid accusations of various incidents of misconduct, including sexual harassment. An investigation did not corroborate the allegations.
