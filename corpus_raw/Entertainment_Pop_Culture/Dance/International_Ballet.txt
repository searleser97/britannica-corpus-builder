International Ballet,   British dance company. Founded in 1941 by Mona Inglesby to bring classical ballet to new urban and provincial audiences, it performed in cinemas and arenas, as well as at more conventional sites. The repertory included revivals of full-length ballets, especially Fokineâ€™s, with Nicholas Sergeyev as ballet master. It successfully toured Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. Dancers Moira Shearer, Nina Tarakanova, and Ernest Hewitt belonged to the company, which disbanded in 1953.
