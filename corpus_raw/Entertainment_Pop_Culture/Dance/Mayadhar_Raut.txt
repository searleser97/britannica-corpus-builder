Mayadhar Raut,  (born July 6, 1930, Kantepenhara, near Cuttack, Orissa, India),  exponent of the Indian classical dance form odissi. As a child, Raut was a gotipua, a boy designated to learn a style of temple dance previously performed by female temple dancers. At age eight he became a dancer with the Orissa Theatre. He went to Puri’s Annapurna Theatre in 1945 and studied Radha-Krishna abhinaya (gesture language). At this time, he also began training in modern and creative dance. He eventually went to Jaipur to study the kathak (dance) style of Jaipur gharana (a community of performers who share a distinctive style) with Ramgopal Mishra.
In 1952 Raut joined the Kala Vikas Kendra (an organization engaged in professional training for several arts) in Cuttack as the first teacher of odissi. He won a scholarship in 1955 from the Orissa branch of Sangeet Natak Akademi (India’s national academy of music, dance, and drama) to pursue dance studies at the Kalakshetra Foundation in Madras (now Chennai). Along with odissi, Raut studied kathakali, bharata natyam, bhagvat mela natakam, and abhinaya. That training enabled him to choreograph dance-dramas such as Tapaswini, Meghdoot, Brij Leela, Singhala Kumari, Krishna Charitam, and Geeta Govindam.
In 1967 Raut was asked to join Nritya Niketan, a dance school in New Delhi, and in 1970 he became head of the odissi dance department at the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra, New Delhi. He continued in this position for 25 years.
Known for his grace, depth of expression, and technical perfection, Raut made many contributions to odissi. Among these were the introduction of sanchari bhava (physical commentary on the text being enacted), formalizing the use of hastas, or mudras (hand gestures), systematizing odissi techniques, and training students, both Indian and international, who would faithfully follow his approaches and techniques.
