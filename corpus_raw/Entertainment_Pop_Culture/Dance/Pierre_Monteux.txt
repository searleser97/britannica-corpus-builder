Pierre Monteux,  (born April 4, 1875, Paris, France—died July 1, 1964, Hancock, Maine, U.S.), one of the leading conductors of the 20th century, acclaimed for his interpretations ranging from Beethoven to contemporary composers such as Stravinsky and Arthur Honegger.
He studied at the Paris Conservatory and later was a professional viola player. As conductor (1911–14) for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in Paris, he led the world premieres of Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring (1913) and Ravel’s Daphnis et Chloé. After World War I (in which he served in the French Army), he conducted at the Metropolitan Opera (1917–19) and directed the Boston Symphony (1919–24). He founded and directed the Paris Symphony (1929–38) and then returned to the U.S. to take over the newly reorganized San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1943 he established an annual summer school for student conductors at Hancock, Maine. From 1960 he was permanent conductor of the London Symphony.
As a conductor, Monteux was equally admired in ballet, opera, and symphonic music. His interpretations were considered elegant and refined.
