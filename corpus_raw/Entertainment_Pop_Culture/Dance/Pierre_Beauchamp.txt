Pierre Beauchamp,  Beauchamp also spelled Beauchamps,  (born 1636, Versailles, Fr.—died  1705, Paris), French ballet dancer and teacher whose contributions to the development of ballet include the definition of the five basic positions of the feet.
In 1661 Beauchamp was appointed director of the Académie Royale de Danse, which in 1672 under the composer Jean-Baptiste Lully became a part of the Académie Royale de Musique, now called the Paris Opéra. As a dancer Beauchamp was noted for his dignified style and for his technique, particularly his pirouettes; in 1681 he appeared as Louis XIV’s female partner in Lully’s ballet Le Triomphe de l’amour. Considered the first choreographer of the Paris Opéra, Beauchamp arranged many court ballets and staged the dance sequences in several of Molière’s plays as well as Lully’s operas.
He also devised a system of dance notation that, though never published, was used by his pupils, one of whom was Raoul Feuillet, author of one of the earliest published systems of dance notation. With Lully and Louis XIV, Beauchamp was largely responsible for the increasing professionalization of ballet; through his teaching he helped raise technical standards so that specialized training became necessary and amateur dancers from the royal court were no longer the sole performers of ballet. He retired in 1687 following Lully’s death.
