Carmagnole,  originally, a Piedmontese peasant costume (from the Italian town of Carmagnola) that was well known in the south of France and brought to Paris by the revolutionaries of Marseille in 1792.
The costume, later the popular dress of the Jacobins, consisted of a short-skirted coat with rows of metal buttons, a tricoloured waistcoat, and red cap. The name carmagnole was also applied to a famous Revolutionary song and dance widely performed during the Reign of Terror.
