Hora,   folk dance of Romania and Israel, performed in a linked circle. The most popular Romanian hora, the Hora Mare, or Great Hora, is danced both on special occasions such as weddings and for relaxation. It is a metaphor for the community: the circle opens to admit nubile women, adolescent boys entering manhood, and those ending mourning; conversely, it shuts out anyone who has violated local moral standards. The dance steps are simple: the dancers face the centre, take one step forward, one back, three to the left, and five to the right, so that soon the circle moves counterclockwise.
The Israeli hora, imported from the Balkans, does not carry social import or festive significance; rather, it is an expression of happiness. Unlike the Romanian Great Hora, it is performed with grapevine steps. The hora, related to the Yugoslav kolo and the Bulgarian horo, is one of many European circular chain dances surviving from ancient times. See also carole.
