Bourrée,   French folk dance with many varieties, characteristically danced with quick, skipping steps. The dancers occasionally wear wooden clogs to emphasize the sounds made by their feet. Notably associated with Auvergne, bourrées are also danced elsewhere in France and in Vizcaya, Spain. Michael Praetorius mentions the bourrée in his musical compendium Syntagma musicum in 1615.
Stylized bourrées in 2/4 or 4/4 time (folk bourrées also occur in 3/8 time) have been composed as abstract musical pieces since the mid-16th century. In such 18th-century suites as those of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel, the bourrée often appears as one of the galanteries, or optional movements.
The bourrée was among the dances from which ballet derived its early steps. The pas de bourrée (“bourrée step”) has been variously elaborated; it is usually a small, quick step executed in preparation for a larger step. Pas de bourrée couru (“running bourrée”) is a smooth run on the toes, with the feet close together (first or fifth positions).
