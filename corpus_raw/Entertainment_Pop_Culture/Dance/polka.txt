Polka,   lively courtship dance of Bohemian folk origin. It is characterized by three quick steps and a hop and is danced to music in 2/4 time. The couples cover much space as they circle about the dance floor. Introduced in Paris in about 1843, it became extraordinarily popular in ballrooms and on the stage, sweeping across Europe and the Americas from Scandinavia to Latin America and developing many varieties. Still popular in the 20th century both as a folk dance and as a ballroom dance, polkas also appear in stage works—e.g., in Jaromir Weinberger’s opera Schwanda the Bagpiper and in Bedřich Smetana’s opera The Bartered Bride.
