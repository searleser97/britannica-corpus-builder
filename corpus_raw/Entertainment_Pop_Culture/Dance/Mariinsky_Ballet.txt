Mariinsky Ballet, also spelled Maryinsky, Russian Mariinsky Balet, formerly (1935–91) Kirov Ballet,  prominent Russian ballet company, part of the Mariinsky Theatre of Opera and Ballet in St. Petersburg. Its traditions, deriving from its predecessor, the Imperial Russian Ballet, are based on the work of such leading 19th-century choreographers as Jules Perrot, Arthur Saint-Léon, and Marius Petipa and such dancers as Marie Taglioni, Olga Preobrajenska, Mathilde Kschessinska, Anna Pavlova, Vaslav Nijinsky, Tamara Karsavina, Michel Fokine, George Balanchine, and Alexandra Danilova.
The company began as a dancing academy founded in St. Petersburg in 1738. Its early performances were before the royal court, and, after 1780, in the Petrovsky (now Bolshoi) Theatre. The Imperial Russian Ballet was established as a professional company and became the centre of Russian ballet. In the late 19th century the company moved to the Mariinsky Theatre, where it became the resident ballet company, acquiring the Mariinsky name. With the October Revolution of 1917, the company lost 40 percent of its personnel but was able to maintain its repertoire and its technical proficiency under the teacher Agrippina Vaganova and artistic director Konstantin Sergeyev. During the Soviet period the theatre was renamed the S.M. Kirov State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet, and the company became known as the Kirov Ballet. New works on heroic themes were produced, as well as such experimental works as Igor Belsky’s The Coast of Hope (1959). After 1961 the company toured western Europe, the United States, and Canada. With the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the theatre and company reclaimed their Mariinsky name.
