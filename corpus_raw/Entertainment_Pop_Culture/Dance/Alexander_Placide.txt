Alexander Placide,  (born 1750, France—died  July 26, 1812, New York City), French-born U.S. dancer, mime, acrobat, and impresario who produced in the U.S. such diverse and novel entertainment as ballets, pantomime dramas, patriotic pageants, fencing matches, and bird imitations.
The son of travelling acrobats, Placide studied dance in Paris, had his first theatrical success as a tightrope walker at the court of Louis XVI, and toured Europe with his acrobat troupe. In Santo Domingo he met the dancer and choreographer Suzanne Theodore Vaillande (later Douvillier), who, though not his wife, appeared with him as “Madame Placide” when he performed a “dancing ballot” [sic] called The Bird Catcher in New York (1792). In 1794 Placide established a dance and pantomime company at the French (later City) Theatre in Charleston, S.C. There, with the choreographer Jean-Baptiste Francisqui and the dancers Jean-Baptiste Val, “Madame Placide,” and the young Louis Duport, Placide produced such ballets as Jean-Georges Noverre’s Caprices de Galathée and Maximilien Gardel’s Chercheuse d’esprit (Searchers for Spirit). He also presented French actors in pantomime dramas and once used the local militia for a spectacle commemorating the Battle of Fort Moultrie. In 1798 he began producing in Savannah and Augusta, Ga. He married the actress and dancer Charlotte Sophia Wrighten in 1796; their son Henry (1799–1870) became one of the most popular U.S. actors of his generation.
