Coppélia,  comic ballet by French composer Léo Delibes that premiered in Paris on May 2, 1870. It was an immediate success and soon reappeared in the form of excerpts scored for piano and as an orchestral suite.
Coppélia was based on German writer E.T.A. Hoffmann’s story “Der Sandmann” (1816; “The Sandman”), a dark psychological fantasy concerning a man’s destructive infatuation for a lifelike mechanical doll. The same tale was later featured in Jacques Offenbach’s The Tales of Hoffmann, which preserved the tragic and surreal mood of the original. Delibes, however, presented French audiences with an amusing and sweet-tempered version of the story.
Of particular musical interest are a sequence of folk dances in Act 1, which features eastern European dances such as the mazurka and the czardas; and the mechanical doll’s dance in Act 2, a steady waltz with clockwork precision befitting a dancing automaton.
