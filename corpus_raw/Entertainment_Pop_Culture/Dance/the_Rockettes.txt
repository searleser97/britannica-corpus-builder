The Rockettes, in full Radio City Rockettes, formerly Missouri Rockets or Roxyettes,  world-famous American precision dance team.
The origins of the Rockettes, the world’s most famous precision dance team, can be traced to 1925, when impresario Russell Markert of St. Louis, Missouri, billed a group of women dancers as the Missouri Rockets. Following a positive reception locally, the dance team began a nationwide tour. Among their admiring audiences in New York City was Samuel (“Roxy”) Rothafel, owner of the new Roxy Theater. He acquired the troupe, doubled its size, and dubbed the dancers the Roxyettes. After opening the Radio City Music Hall—the world’s largest indoor theatre—he enlarged the troupe again in order to fill the hall’s Great Stage. The dance team became known as the Rockettes in 1934.
Over the years the Rockettes attained international renown for their intricate dance routines and, in particular, for their extremely high kicks. In the early 21st century more than 150 precision dancers performed as Rockettes, some at the Radio City Music Hall and others on tour or at special events. To become a Rockette, a dancer must be at least 18 years old, between 5 feet 6 inches (1.71 metres) and 5 feet 10.5 inches (1.82 metres) tall, and proficient in tap, jazz, ballet, and modern dance.
