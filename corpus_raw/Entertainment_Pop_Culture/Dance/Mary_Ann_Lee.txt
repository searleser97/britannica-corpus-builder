Mary Ann Lee,  (born 1823, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.—died  1899), one of the first American ballet dancers. Her 10-year career included the first American performance of the classic ballet Giselle (Boston, 1846).
Trained in Philadelphia by Paul Hazard of the Paris Opéra, Lee made her debut in 1837 with a fellow student, Augusta Maywood, in The Maid of Cashmere (an English version of Auber’s opera-ballet Le Dieu et la Bayadère). She also studied in New York City with James Sylvain, who taught her the fiery character dances performed by his partner, the much-acclaimed Austrian ballerina Fanny Elssler.
After several tours of the United States, Lee studied at the Paris Opéra with Jean Coralli, the principal choreographer of Giselle, and returned to tour the United States with the dancer George Washington Smith. Together they presented authentic productions of Giselle, La Fille du Danube, and other ballets. Lee’s health began to fail in 1846, and she retired the following year at the age of 24.
