Maria Tallchief, original name Elizabeth Marie Tall Chief,  (born January 24, 1925, Fairfax, Oklahoma, U.S.—died April 11, 2013, Chicago, Illinois), ballet dancer whose exquisite technique was enhanced by her energy, speed, and grace. Considered one of the greatest ballerinas of the United States, she was also the muse of choreographer George Balanchine.
Born in a town on an Osage Indian reservation in Oklahoma, Maria Tallchief and her sister, Marjorie, were of Osage and Scotch-Irish descent. Both sisters began dancing as children and later studied with Bronislava Nijinska and David Lichine, among others.
In 1942 Tallchief joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, a leading touring company based in New York City following the outbreak of World War II. Over the next five years she attracted much attention with her performances in such Balanchine-choreographed works as Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, Le Baiser de la fée, and two for which she created the roles—Danses concertantes (1944) and Night Shadow (1946). She and Balanchine married in 1946, but by 1952 the marriage had ended. Tallchief left the Ballet Russe early in 1947 and, after a few months as guest artist with the Paris Opéra Ballet, joined the new Ballet Society, which the next year became the New York City Ballet (NYCB).
In her 18 years with that company, Tallchief was the foremost exponent of Balanchine’s choreography, and she was the company’s prima ballerina in 1954–55. She earned acclaim for her performances in Orpheus (1948), Firebird and Bourrée fantasque (both in 1949), Caracole and Scotch Symphony (both in 1952), Pas de dix (1955), Allegro brillante (1956), and Gounod Symphony (1958). In addition, she originated the roles for Balanchine’s versions of Sylvia Pas de Deux (1950), Swan Lake (1951), and The Nutcracker (1954). She extended her repertoire with American Ballet Theatre, appearing (1960–62) primarily in dramatic roles.
After retiring from the stage in 1965, she became a noted teacher in Chicago, where she founded (1974) the ballet school of the Lyric Opera and served (1981–87) as artistic director of the Chicago City Ballet. In 1996 she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame, and that year she also received a Kennedy Center Honor. The autobiography Maria Tallchief: America’s Prima Ballerina (cowritten with Larry Kaplan) was published in 1997.
