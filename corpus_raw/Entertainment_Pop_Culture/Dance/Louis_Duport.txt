Louis Duport, in full Louis-Antoine Duport,  (born 1781/83, Paris, France—died October 19, 1853, Paris), French ballet dancer who refined classical technique, excelling particularly in multiple pirouettes and high, soaring leaps.
Duport was a child prodigy dancer and violinist. He danced in Paris from 1799 to 1806 and challenged Auguste Vestris’s supremacy as leading male dancer at the Paris Académie (now Opéra). Duport danced in St. Petersburg (1808–12), where he was highly acclaimed for his performances in Charles Didelot’s ballets, notably Zéphyre et Flore. He also danced in Vienna, Naples, and London, giving his last performance in 1830. Until 1836 he directed productions at the Kärntnerthor Theatre in Vienna, then retired to Paris with a great fortune.
