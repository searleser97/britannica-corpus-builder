Bergamasca, also spelled bergomask,  lusty 16th-century dance depicting the reputedly awkward manners of the inhabitants of Bergamo, in northern Italy, where the dance supposedly originated. It was performed as a circle courtship dance for couples: men circled forward and women backward until the melody changed; partners then embraced, turned a few steps, and began again. The rustics in Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream perform a bergomask.
The bergamasca never became a court dance, although it gained some popularity as an instrumental composition built on a ground bass. Claude Debussy’s Suite bergamasque (1890) and Gabriel Fauré’s Masques et bergamasques (1919) did not use the bergamasca as a specific musical form; both works were inspired by Verlaine’s poem “Clair de lune,” in which the name of the bygone dance bergamasque evokes a dreamy image.
