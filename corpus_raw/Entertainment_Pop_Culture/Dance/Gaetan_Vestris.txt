Gaétan Vestris, Italian in full Gaetano Apollino Baldassare Vestri,  (born April 18, 1729, Florence—died  Sept. 23, 1808, Paris), the finest French male ballet dancer of his time.
With his parents, brothers, and sisters—almost all of whom had careers in the theatre—he went to Paris in 1747 and about a year later, at age 19, entered the Paris Opéra ballet school, studying under Louis Dupré. Vestris danced briefly in the ensemble, was appointed soloist in 1751, and for the next 30 years enjoyed a succession of triumphs in the ballets of Jean-Barthélemy Lany, Pierre Gardel, and Jean-Georges Noverre. Because of his conceited ways, as well as his undisputed gifts, he was called, half ironically, “the god of the dance.”
