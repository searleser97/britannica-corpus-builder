Kelucharan Mohapatra,  (born January 8, 1926, Raghurajpur, Orissa, India—died April 7, 2004, Bhubaneshwar), Indian dancer who led a 20th-century revival of odissi, a centuries-old style of dance associated with temples of Orissa and one of the principal forms of Indian classical dance.
Mohapatra was born to a family of artists who painted patachitras (religious folk paintings on thinly woven cloth). He trained and performed as a traditional dancer and drummer, studying in his youth with masters of odissi. In 1953 he began teaching odissi at a conservatory in Cuttack. Excelling in both technique and pantomimic expression, Mohapatra sought to expand the style’s traditional repertoire, making innovative use of forms from ancient texts and sculptures in his choreography. Mohapatra soon came to be regarded as a master of Indian classical dance, and his performances popularized odissi both in India and around the world.
Mohapatra received a number of awards from the Indian government for his cultural and artistic achievements, including the prestigious Padma Vibhushan in 2000.
