Camargo Society,   group credited with keeping ballet alive in England during the early 1930s. Named after Marie Camargo, the noted 18th-century ballerina, the society was formed in 1930 by Philip J.S. Richardson, the editor of Dancing Times, the critic Arnold Haskell, and other patrons to stimulate interest in creating a national ballet. For the next three years the group annually commissioned three or four ballets on a subscription basis. The productions used mainly native talent, relying heavily on dancers from the small Rambert and de Valois groups and on young and unknown choreographers. In 1933 the Camargo Societyâ€™s repertoire was incorporated into the Vic-Wells (now the Royal) Ballet.
