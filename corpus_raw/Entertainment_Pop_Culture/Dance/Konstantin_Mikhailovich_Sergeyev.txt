Konstantin Mikhailovich Sergeyev,  (born Feb. 20 [March 5, New Style], 1910, St. Petersburg, Russia—died  April 1, 1992, St. Petersburg), Russian ballet dancer and director long associated with the Kirov (now Mariinsky) Ballet as a premier danseur (1930–61) and as both artistic director and chief choreographer (1951–55; 1960–70).
In 1930 Sergeyev completed his studies with the State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet (Kirov was added to the name in 1935; now called the Mariinsky Theatre) and joined the company. He quickly rose to leading roles in the standard repertory and in new ballets, notably Fountain of Bakhchisaray, Lost Illusions, and The Bronze Horseman. After his acclaimed partner Galina Ulanova transferred to the Bolshoi Ballet in 1944, he danced with Natalya Dudinskaya, whom he married. As a performer he was much admired for his lyrical interpretation of romantic leading roles. As director he focused mainly on classical ballet techniques in the standards but also staged such new productions as Hamlet (1970). He was dismissed from the Kirov in 1970 after company member Natalya Makarova defected while on tour in Britain, but he was reinstated as director of the choreographic school in 1973. Sergeyev was awarded numerous state honours, including the Lenin Prize (1970).
