Passepied, (French: “passing feet”) English  Paspy,  lively dance of Brittany adopted c. 1650 by French and English aristocrats, who, during the century of its popularity, frequently danced it dressed as shepherds and shepherdesses. As a court dance the passepied lost its original chain formations and became, like the minuet, a couple dance with figures. Its name probably refers to its characteristic step: the feet crossed and recrossed while gliding forward, one foot often striking the other.
The music, which begins with an upbeat in fairly rapid 3/4 or 3/8 time, appears occasionally among the optional movements, or galanteries, of the suite, notably in Bach’s Partita in G Major and English Suite No. 5.
