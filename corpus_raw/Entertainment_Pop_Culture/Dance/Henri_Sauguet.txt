Henri Sauguet, original name Henri-Pierre Poupard,  (born May 18, 1901, Bordeaux, France—died  June 22, 1989, Paris), French composer of orchestral, choral, and chamber music notable for its simple charm and melodic grace.
While organist at a church near Bordeaux, Sauguet studied composition and, at the encouragement of Darius Milhaud, moved to Paris. There he became one of the four young Erik Satie disciples who formed L’École d’Arcueil, a successor to Les Six. Sauguet’s first ballet, Les Roses, appeared in 1924. His second, La Chatte (1927; “The Cat”), about a young man and his kitten that is transformed into a beautiful young woman who chases mice, was choreographed by Serge Diaghilev. Sauguet’s ballet scores are among his foremost achievements; among them are La Dame aux camélias (1957; “The Lady of the Camellias”), based on the Alexandre Dumas novel, and Les Forains (1945; “The Aliens”), considered the most accomplished of his ballet works.
Almost from the beginning of his career, Sauguet also composed vocal music, including song cycles, cantatas, and works for male, female, and children’s choirs. The major opera of his six is La Chartreuse de Parma (1927–36; “The Charterhouse of Parma”), based on the Stendhal novel. But Symphonie expiatoire (1945; “Expiatory Symphony”), the first of his four symphonies, is a tragic composition in atonement for French apathy and helplessness under the Nazi occupation during World War II. Sauguet also composed concerti for piano, violin, and cello and much incidental music for plays, films, radio, and television. He was elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1976.
