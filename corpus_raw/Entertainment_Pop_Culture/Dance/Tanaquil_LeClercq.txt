Tanaquil LeClercq,  (born October 2, 1929, Paris, France—died December 31, 2000, New York City, New York, U.S.), versatile American ballet dancer, remembered largely for her work in association with George Balanchine, to whom she was married from 1952 to 1969.
LeClercq grew up in New York City and began taking ballet lessons at age four. In 1941 she entered the School of American Ballet, where she studied under Balanchine. Her first professional performance was at Ted Shawn’s Jacob’s Pillow Festival in Lee, Massachusetts, in August 1945, and in 1946 she became an original member of the Ballet Society formed by Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein. She danced in several premieres, including Balanchine’s Four Temperaments (1946), Divertimento (1947), and Orpheus (1948). She remained a principal dancer when the company became the New York City Ballet (NYCB) in 1948.
Over the next several years LeClercq emerged as one of the company’s most individual stylists and a particularly fine exponent of Balanchine’s choreography. Among the Balanchine works in which she appeared were Bourrée fantasque (premiered 1949), with Maria Tallchief; La Valse (premiered 1951); and Western Symphony (premiered 1954). She also created roles in premieres of Frederick Ashton’s Illuminations (1950), with Melissa Hayden; Jerome Robbins’s Age of Anxiety (1950); and several others. During a European tour with NYCB in 1956, she was stricken with polio, which abruptly ended her dancing career. She later wrote Mourka: The Autobiography of a Cat (1964) and The Ballet Cook Book (1967) and taught at the Dance Theater of Harlem.
