Niel Gow,  (born March 22, 1727, Inver, Perthshire, Scot.—died  March 1, 1807, Inver), violinist known for his publications of old Scottish melodies.
Gow taught himself the violin and became renowned as a player of Scottish dance music. Between 1784 and 1792 a number of his strathspey reels were published in three collections; some of the melodies were original, some traditional, some adaptations of traditional airs. His sons William, John, and Andrew contributed pieces to their father’s collections, and John and Andrew became music publishers in London. His fourth son, Nathaniel (1766–1831), was also known as a violinist and composer of Scottish dances. Nathaniel prepared his father’s collections for publication and published his own airs, reels, and strathspeys in three more collections (1808–22). He also published a four-volume Complete Repository of the Original Scotch Slow Tunes (1799–1817). Nathaniel’s son, Niel the younger (1795-1823), was also a composer; his song “Flora Macdonald’s Lament” became highly popular.
