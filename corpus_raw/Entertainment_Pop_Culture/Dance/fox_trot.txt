Fox-trot,   ballroom dance popular in Europe and America since its introduction around 1914. Allegedly named for the comedian Harry Fox, whose 1913 Ziegfeld Follies act included a trotting step, the fox-trot developed less strenuous walking steps for its ballroom version. The music, influenced by ragtime, is in 4/4 time with syncopated rhythm. The speed of the step varies with the music: half notes (minims) require slow steps; and quarter notes (crotchets), fast steps.
The fox-trot consists primarily of walking steps, chassés (step side, close step), and quarter turns. Couples usually hold each other in the traditional ballroom position, but numerous variations are done in other positions. Fox-trots for fast music include the one-step (one walking step to each musical beat) popularized by Irene and Vernon Castle shortly after the dance’s inception and the peabody (with a quick leg cross).
