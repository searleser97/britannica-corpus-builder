Big apple,   1930s square-dance version of the jitterbug that was named for the Columbia, S.C., club where it originated. Assembled in a large circle, dancers did a basic shuffling step or other jitterbug step like the lindy hop. Directions such as “right foot forward” or “get your girl and take a twirl” were given by a caller, but more enterprising dancers, singly or in couples, frequently improvised.
