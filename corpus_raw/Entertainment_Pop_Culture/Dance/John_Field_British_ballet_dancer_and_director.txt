John Field, byname of John Greenfield,  (born Oct. 22, 1921, Doncaster, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  Aug. 3, 1991, Esher, Surrey), British ballet dancer and director, long-time artistic director of the Royal Ballet’s touring company (1956–70).
Field studied dance in Liverpool and first appeared with the Liverpool Ballet Club at age 17. He became a soloist with the Sadler’s Wells Ballet in 1939, joined the Royal Air Force in 1942, and returned to the company after World War II, becoming a principal dancer. He danced many leading roles and partnered most of the company’s ballerinas, most notably Beryl Grey, Svetlana Beriosova, and Margot Fonteyn.
Field retired from dancing in 1956 to take charge of the second company of Sadler’s Wells, which became the Royal Ballet a few months later. He became assistant director in 1957, continuing to guide the second company when it concentrated on touring. When Sir Frederick Ashton retired (1970) as director of the Royal Ballet, Field and Kenneth MacMillan were appointed codirectors. This arrangement, however, proved unsuitable to Field, who left a few months later. He was director of ballet at La Scala in Milan (1971–74), artistic director (1975–79) and director (1976–79) of the Royal Academy of Dancing in London, and artistic director (1979–81) and director (1982–84) of the London Festival Ballet (now the English National Ballet). He was codirector (with his wife, former dancer Anne Heaton) of the British Ballet Organisation from 1984 until a month before his death in 1991.
