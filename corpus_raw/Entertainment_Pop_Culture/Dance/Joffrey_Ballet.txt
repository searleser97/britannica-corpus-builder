Joffrey Ballet,  American ballet company, founded in 1956 by Robert Joffrey as a traveling company of six dancers affiliated with his school, the American Ballet Center. Following six U.S. tours, the troupe took tours in the Middle East and Southeast Asia (1962–63) and in the Soviet Union and United States (1963–64), and it provided summer workshops for the dancers and the choreographers Gerald Arpino, Fernand Nault, Donald Saddler, Brian Macdonald, and Alvin Ailey. In 1964 Joffrey and Arpino, the resident choreographer, established a new financial footing for the company. In 1966 it moved to the New York City Center, and for a time the company was known as the City Center Joffrey Ballet. It became noted for its imaginative contemporary repertoire, athletic dancers, and the introduction of psychedelic effects to ballet. In 1995 the company moved to Chicago, where it became that city’s foremost ballet company.
