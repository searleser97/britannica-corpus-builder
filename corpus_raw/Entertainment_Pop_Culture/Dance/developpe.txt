Développé,  (French: “developed,” or “unfolded”), in ballet, a smooth, gradual unfolding of the leg. The dancer raises the thigh to the side with the knee bent while bringing the toe of the working leg along the calf to the back of the knee of the supporting leg. The working leg is then straightened to the front, side, or back (arabesque).
