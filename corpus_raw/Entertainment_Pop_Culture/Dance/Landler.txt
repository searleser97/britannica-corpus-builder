Ländler,  traditional couple dance of Bavaria and Alpine Austria. To lively music in 3/4 time, the dancers turn under each other’s arms using complicated arm and hand holds, dance back to back, and grasp each other firmly to turn around and around. These figures and the triple rhythm have appeared in turning dances characteristic of German peasant dances from the Middle Ages. Ländler melodies became fashionable in 18th- and 19th-century Vienna, and the dance greatly influenced the evolution of the waltz.
The Ländler has many variants, among them the Steyrischer, with improvised satiric verse and syncopated hand clapping, and the Schuhplattler, a courtship dance in which the men perform exuberant, acrobatic displays, stamp their feet, slap their hands and body, and end by lifting the women high off the ground. The Schuhplattler is one of several European courtship dances, such as the Basque aurresku, the Norwegian halling, and the Ukrainian hopak, in which the men show off for their partners.
