Rambert, formerly Ballet Rambert and Rambert Dance Company,  the oldest existing dance company in England. Initially established to perform ballets, it evolved into a contemporary dance company. It has been an important training ground for young talent; among the famous artists who gained early experience with the company were the dancers Alicia Markova and Margot Fonteyn and the choreographers Antony Tudor, Frederick Ashton, Agnes de Mille, Andrée Howard, Walter Gore, and Peggy van Praagh.
Inspired by Dame Marie Rambert, a former dancer with Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, the Rambert Dancers (first performed in 1926) and the Ballet Club (established in 1930) staged small-scale Sunday afternoon productions that were mainly new ballets by unknown choreographers. In 1935 the company became known as the Rambert Ballet. During World War II it toured factories, military camps, and outlying areas and later staged seasons in major London theatres. Its postwar tours included one of Australia and New Zealand (1947–48) that greatly stimulated interest there in ballet.
In the late 20th century the company began to expand its repertoire beyond ballet, especially under artistic director Richard Alston, who in 1987 oversaw the name change to Rambert Dance Company. Later, under Mark Baldwin, the Rambert (as it became known in 2013) notably performed works that combined various art forms.
