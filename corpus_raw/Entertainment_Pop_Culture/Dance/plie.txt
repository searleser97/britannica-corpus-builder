Plié,   (French: “bent”), knee bend in ballet. It is used in jumps and turns to provide spring, absorb shock, and as an exercise to loosen muscles and to develop balance. Performed in all of the five basic foot positions, pliés may be shallow, so that the dancer’s heels remain on the floor (demi-plié), or deep, so that in all foot positions except the second the heels rise (grand plié).
