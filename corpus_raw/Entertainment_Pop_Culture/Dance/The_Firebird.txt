The Firebird,  ballet by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky, first performed in Paris on June 25, 1910. It was the first international success of the composer’s career.
Although The Firebird was the work that elevated Stravinsky to international renown, he was offered the commission to compose the ballet for the newly formed Ballets Russes only after several prominent Russian composers had already rejected it. With the premiere at the Paris Opéra quickly approaching, Serge Diaghilev, the grand impresario of the Ballets Russes, selected the inexperienced Stravinsky, then only 27 years old, on the basis of his early orchestral works. Stravinsky received the commission in December 1909 and immediately set to work in St. Petersburg.
The ballet is based on the Russian legend of the Firebird, a powerful good spirit whose feathers supposedly convey beauty and protection upon the earth. Other characters from Russian lore are also included: the heroic Prince Ivan Tsarevich and the evil sorcerer Kashchei, from whom Ivan must rescue the princess he loves. It is only through the intervention of the Firebird, whose life he spares early in the ballet, that Ivan is able to destroy Kashchei and his followers and marry the princess. The folk origins of the story inspired Stravinsky to borrow a few folk melodies in his score. Yet most of the ballet, especially the fluttering dance of the Firebird and the memorable wedding march at the ballet’s conclusion, was his own creation.
The Firebird ballet was completed by May 1910 and was promptly sent to Paris, where the dancers were already preparing. A final obstacle arose when the principal ballerina refused to dance the role of the Firebird, declaring that she detested the music, and had to be replaced. The ballerina’s objections notwithstanding, Stravinsky achieved instant recognition as one of the most original and powerful composers of his generation.
