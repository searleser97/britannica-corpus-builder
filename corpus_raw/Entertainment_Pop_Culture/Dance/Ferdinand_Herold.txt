He was court pianist in Naples, where he produced his first opera, La gioventù di Enrico V (1815; The Youth of Henry V). On his return to Paris he collaborated with François Boieldieu in the opera Charles de France (1816) and produced 12 light operas at the Opéra-Comique between 1817 and 1830. Among his other operas are Vendôme en Espagne (with Auber, 1823), Zampa (1831), and Le Pré aux clercs (1832; The Field of Honour). His ballets include La Fille mal gardée (1828; The Unguarded Maiden) and La Belle au bois dormant (1829; The Sleeping Beauty).
