Dame Alicia Markova, original name Lilian Alicia Marks,  (born December 1, 1910, London, England—died December 2, 2004, Bath), English ballerina noted for the ethereal lightness and poetic delicacy of her dancing.
Markova studied with Serafima Astafieva and Enrico Cecchetti and, after her debut at age 14 with Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, was soon dancing leading roles. In 1931 she joined the Vic-Wells Ballet (now the Royal Ballet) and was both its first prima ballerina (1933–35) and the first English dancer to dance the lead in Giselle and the full-length Swan Lake. Markova appeared as a ballerina of the Ballet Rambert, Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo, and Ballet Theatre (now the American Ballet Theatre) and as a guest artist with the Metropolitan Opera. With Anton Dolin she founded the Markova-Dolin Ballet (1935) and Festival Ballet (1950; now the English National Ballet).
In addition to Giselle, her favourite role, and Swan Lake, Markova excelled in Les Sylphides, as Taglioni (to whom she has been compared) in the Dolin Pas de quatre, and as the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker. A versatile artist, she shone not only in the classics but also in early jazz ballets, in Léonide Massine’s symphonic Rouge et noir (1939), as a Gypsy in Aleko (1942), as Juliet in Antony Tudor’s Romeo and Juliet (1943), and in Ruth Page’s Vilea (1953).
In 1963 she retired from the stage, was appointed director of the Metropolitan Ballet in New York City (a post she held until 1969), and was created Dame of the British Empire. Markova, in retirement as a dancer, taught, coached, lectured, and occasionally staged traditional ballets for various companies.
