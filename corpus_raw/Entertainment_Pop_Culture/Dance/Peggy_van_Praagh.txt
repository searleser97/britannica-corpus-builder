Dame Peggy van Praagh, original name Margaret van Praagh,  (born Sept. 1, 1910, London, Eng.—died Jan. 15, 1990, Melbourne, Australia), British-born ballet dancer and director, and founder and tireless artistic director (1963–74) of the Australian Ballet.
Throughout the 1930s van Praagh worked as a dancer and teacher. She joined Ballet Rambert in London in 1933 and maintained a long, fruitful association with choreographer Antony Tudor, in whose Jardin aux Lilas (1936) and Dark Elegies (1937) she created especially notable leading roles. In 1938 she joined Tudor’s newly formed London Ballet, and upon his 1939 departure for America she became the company’s codirector. She then moved to the Sadler’s Wells Ballet as a teacher and dancer (1941–55) before becoming ballet mistress and director of the touring company.
Van Praagh then freelanced in Europe and America as a producer, director, and teacher from 1955 to 1960, when she was invited to Australia to direct the Borovansky Ballet. She urged the Australian government to form a national ballet company; the government agreed, provided that she assumed its direction. In Australia she cultivated a distinct national style, commissioned works by Australian composers, and worked to raise the level of ballet instruction throughout the country. She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966 and was elevated to Dame Commander in 1970.
