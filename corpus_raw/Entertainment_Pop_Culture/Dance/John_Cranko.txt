John Cranko,  (born Aug. 15, 1927, Rustenburg, S.Af.—died  June 26, 1973, Dublin), dancer, choreographer, and ballet director best known for his work with the Stuttgart Ballet.
His basic dance training was at the Cape Town University Ballet School, where he performed as well as choreographed his first ballet, The Soldier’s Tale (1942). In 1946 he joined the Sadler’s Wells Ballet (later called the Royal Ballet) and continued to choreograph. Pineapple Poll (1951) and The Prince of the Pagodas (1957) were two of his early successes. Cranko found his choreographic opportunities limited, however, and he left to become the director of the Stuttgart Ballet in 1961.
Though the company was little known at the time, Cranko developed the Stuttgart into one of the world’s leading companies. In addition to creating his own works, he re-choreographed a number of ballet classics. He was also the principal choreographer for the Bavarian State Opera Ballet from 1968 to 1971. His career ended suddenly when he died of a heart attack while returning with his company from a successful U.S. tour.
