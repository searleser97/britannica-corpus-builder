Royal Danish Ballet,   ballet troupe founded as the resident company of the Royal Theatre of Copenhagen in 1748. It was developed principally by the ballet masters Pierre Laurent, who established the company’s school in 1771; Vincenzo Galeotti (director, 1775–1816), who built its repertoire of dramatic ballets; and August Bournonville, who directed from 1829 to 1877 and for whose classic style the present company is acclaimed.
After a decline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Royal Danish Ballet was revived by Harald Lander, director from 1932 to 1951. The company developed internationally acclaimed soloists—including Erik Bruhn, Henning Kronstam, Peter Martins, and Peter Schaufuss. It performed many contemporary works choreographed by foreign artists including George Balanchine, Sir Frederick Ashton, and Birgit Cullberg. After 1953 the company toured and established an international reputation under Lander’s successors.
