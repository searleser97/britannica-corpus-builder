John Durang,  (born Jan. 6, 1768, York, Pa.—died  1822, Philadelphia), the first U.S.-born professional dancer of note, who was best known for his hornpipe dance. In 1784, when Durang was 17 years old, he made his debut as a performer in Lewis Hallam’s “lecture” and patriotic extravaganza. Plays and dances were banned by law at that time, and the euphemism lecture was used for such events. Thus began Durang’s dance career, and although he did study ballet with visiting European dancers, he was not a trained classical dancer.
The French acrobat and violinist Alexander Placide was influential in Durang’s career. Placide’s versatility was reflected in the many talents of Durang as acrobat, actor, juggler, writer, director, and stage manager. Another Frenchman, Jean-Baptiste Francisqui, who was the director of the Old American Company, also influenced Durang. Durang danced in his company, often with the ballerina Mme Anna Gardie from Santo Domingo. Francisqui’s productions were Durang’s inspiration for the ballets and pageants that he created in his later years.
