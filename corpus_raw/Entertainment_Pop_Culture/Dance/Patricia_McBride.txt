Patricia McBride,  (born August 23, 1942, Teaneck, New Jersey, U.S.), American ballerina best known for her performances with the New York City Ballet.
McBride began her dance training when she was seven years old. At age 13 she began classes in New York City with Sonia Doubrovinskaya and at the School of American Ballet, making her debut in 1957 with André Eglevsky’s Petit Ballet Company.
McBride performed with the New York City Ballet as an apprentice, entered the corps de ballet in 1959, became a soloist a year later, and was made principal dancer in 1961. Her radiant technique inspired roles in many ballets, perhaps most notably in George Balanchine’s Tarantella (1964) and Jewels (1967). Her performance in Who Cares? (1970) was widely acclaimed. Later dances included Dybbuk Variations (1974) and Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme (1978). After 30 years with the New York City Ballet, she retired in 1989.
In 1996 McBride became associate artistic director at the North Carolina Dance Theatre (later called Charlotte Ballet), with her husband, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, serving as artistic director; he retired in 2017. She also was a master teacher at the dance academy. In 2014 she received a Kennedy Center Honor.
