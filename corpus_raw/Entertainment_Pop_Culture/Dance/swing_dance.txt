Swing dance,  Social dance form dating from the 1940s. Danced in the U.S. to swing music, the dance steps have distinct regional variations, including forms such as the West Coast swing, the East’s jitterbug-lindy, the South’s shag, and in Texas the push (Dallas) and the whip (Houston). Performance versions include extreme athletic moves that distinguish them from everyday social swing dance. Though swing dance had largely disappeared by 1960, a revival began in the late 1980s and has since spread widely.
