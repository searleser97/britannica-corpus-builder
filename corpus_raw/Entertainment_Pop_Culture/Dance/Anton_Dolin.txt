Sir Anton Dolin, original name Sydney Francis Patrick Chippendall Healey-kay,  (born July 27, 1904, Slinfold, Sussex, Eng.—died  Nov. 25, 1983, Paris, France), British ballet dancer, choreographer, and director who, with his frequent partner Alicia Markova, founded the Markova-Dolin companies and London’s Festival Ballet.
Trained by the notable Russian teachers Serafima Astafieva and Bronislava Nijinska, Dolin began his ballet career in 1921 in the corps de ballet of Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. As a soloist with Diaghilev’s company, he created the leading role in Nijinska’s Train Bleu (1924) and an important role (one of two Servants) in George Balanchine’s Prodigal Son (1929). Dolin was considered to be one of the finest partners of his time. He eventually danced leading roles in numerous classical ballets but was also noted for such creations as Satan in Ninette de Valois’s Job (1931) and the title role in Michel Fokine’s Bluebeard (1941).
Active in the formation of many companies, Dolin helped establish the Camargo Society (1930–33), whose productions greatly influenced British ballet, and he danced leading roles in the first productions of the Vic-Wells Ballet (now Royal Ballet). He joined the Ballet Theatre, New York City (now American Ballet Theatre) at its inception in 1940, remaining until 1946 as a dancer and choreographer. He was also director and principal male dancer of the Markova-Dolin Ballet (1935–38; 1945–49). In 1949 he and Markova founded another company that in 1950 became London’s Festival Ballet; Dolin was premier danseur and artistic director until 1961. He then organized and toured with the troupe Stars of the Ballet, worked as choreographer and director of the Rome Opera Ballet, and served as artistic adviser to Les Grands Ballets Canadiens. He was knighted in 1981.
As a choreographer Dolin restaged Swan Lake, Giselle, and the last act of The Sleeping Beauty, which he presented alone as Princess Aurora (1941). His original ballets include Capriccioso (1940), The Romantic Age (1942), and Variations for Four (1957), a popular all-male divertissement. Dolin is particularly noted for his reconstruction (1941) of Jules Perrot’s classical divertissement, Pas de Quatre. His many books on the dance include Ballet Go Round (1938), Pas de Deux, the Art of Partnering (1949), Alicia Markova (1953), Autobiography (1960), and The Sleeping Ballerina: The Story of Olga Spessivtzeva (1966).
