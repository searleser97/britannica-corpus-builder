Royal Ballet,  English ballet company and school. It was formed in 1956 under a royal charter of incorporation granted by Queen Elizabeth II to the Sadler’s Wells Ballet and its sister organizations, the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet and the Sadler’s Wells School.
The founders of the Sadler’s Wells Ballet were Lilian Baylis and Ninette de Valois. De Valois established a ballet school in London in 1926, the same year that Baylis, the director of the Old Vic Theatre, engaged her to stage incidental dances for operas and plays. When Baylis took over as director of the Sadler’s Wells Theatre in London in 1931, she and de Valois organized the Vic-Wells Ballet there. While the company performed at the Old Vic and Sadler’s Wells theatres through the 1930s, it was called the Vic-Wells Ballet; later it was known as the Sadler’s Wells Ballet.
Alicia Markova became the company’s first prima ballerina in 1933. When she left the company in 1935, many of her roles were inherited by the 16-year-old Margot Fonteyn, who later matured into one of the great ballerinas of the century. Robert Helpmann, who had joined the company in 1933, became its principal male dancer. In the 1930s the company premiered several important new ballets choreographed by de Valois and by Frederick Ashton. The dancer and choreographer Léonide Massine was associated with the Sadler’s Wells Ballet in the 1940s and ’50s. In 1949 the company made its first triumphant American tour. It was by then a very large organization, with its own school and a sister company, the Sadler’s Wells Theatre Ballet, which had been founded in 1946 to undertake foreign and provincial tours.
In 1956 Sadler’s Wells received a royal charter and was renamed the Royal Ballet. Its two companies began a gradual amalgamation that was completed in 1959. The Royal Ballet, since its formation in 1956, has featured such choreographers as Ashton, Kenneth MacMillan, Bronislava Nijinska, and George Balanchine and has toured widely.
