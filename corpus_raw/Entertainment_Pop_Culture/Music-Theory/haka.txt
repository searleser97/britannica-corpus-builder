Haka, (Maori: “dance”)  Maori posture dance that involves the entire body in vigorous rhythmic movements, which may include swaying, slapping of the chest and thighs, stamping, and gestures of stylized violence. It is accompanied by a chant and, in some cases, by fierce facial expressions meant to intimidate, such as bulging eyes and the sticking out of the tongue. Though often associated with the traditional battle preparations of male warriors, haka may be performed by both men and women, and several varieties of the dance fulfill social functions within Maori culture.
Haka has its origins in Maori legend. The sun god Tama-nui-te-ra and one of his wives, Hine-raumati, who embodies the essence of summer, had a son named Tane-rore. The Maori consider the quivering appearance of the air on hot summer days to be a sign of Tane-rore dancing for his mother, and this light, rapid movement is the foundation of all haka, with the performers’ trembling hands in particular representing Tane-rore’s dance.
Traditionally, haka was performed as part of the rituals of encounter when two parties met or when a visitor was welcomed into the community. Modern examples of occasions for haka include birthdays, weddings, funerals, and other celebratory events. It is also sometimes used as a symbol of tribal identity. Since 1972 the performance of haka has been one of the hallmarks of the widely popular Te Matatini performing arts festival, held biennially in New Zealand.
The most famous haka is “Ka Mate,” composed about 1820 by the Maori chief Te Rauparaha. It became known to the world at large when, in the early 20th century, it was incorporated into the pregame ritual of New Zealand’s national rugby union team, the All Blacks.
