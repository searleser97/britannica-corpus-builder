Pentatonic scale, also called five-note scale or five-tone scale,  musical scale containing five different tones. It is thought that the pentatonic scale represents an early stage of musical development, because it is found, in different forms, in most of the world’s music. The most widely known form is anhemitonic (without semitones; e.g., c–d–f–g–a–c′), the hemitonic form (with semitones; e.g., c–e–f–g–b–c′) occurring less frequently.
Pentatonic scales may have been used in ancient times to tune the Greek kithara (lyre), and some early Gregorian chant incorporated pentatonic melodies. A variety of pentatonic scales occur in the musics of Native Americans, sub-Saharan Africans, and East and Southeast Asians (e.g., the five-tone slendro scale of the Javanese), as well as in many European folk melodies. Pentatonicism was used in an experimental capacity by many 20th-century Western composers, such as Claude Debussy, who employed it in his prelude for piano, “Voiles” (1910).
