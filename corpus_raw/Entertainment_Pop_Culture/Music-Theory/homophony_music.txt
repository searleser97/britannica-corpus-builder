Homophony,   musical texture based primarily on chords, in contrast to polyphony, which results from combinations of relatively independent melodies. In homophony, one part, usually the highest, tends to predominate and there is little rhythmic differentiation between the parts, whereas in polyphony, rhythmic distinctiveness reinforces melodic autonomy.
Homophony does not necessarily suppress counterpoint, however. The “Allegretto” in Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony offers an excellent example of essentially homorhythmic counterpoint, since it combines two distinct, yet rhythmically identical, melodies. An early genre featuring homophony of this sort is the 13th-century conductus.
In the 15th century, Italian secular compositions of popular derivation (e.g., the frottola) were often homophonically conceived, as were numerous 16th-century pieces by Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli and Carlo Gesualdo. Not until the 17th century, however, with such composers as the Italians Arcangelo Corelli, Claudio Monteverdi, and Giacomo Carissimi and the German Johann Hermann Schein, did homophony become dominant in Western music. See also polyphony.
