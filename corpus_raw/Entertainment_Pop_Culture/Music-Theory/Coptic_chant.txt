Coptic chant,   liturgical music of the descendants of ancient Egyptians who converted to Christianity prior to the Islāmic conquest of Egypt in the 7th century. The term Coptic derives from Arabic qibṭ, a corruption of Greek Aigyptios (“Egyptian”); when Muslim Egyptians no longer called themselves by that name, it was applied to the Christian minority. Coptic, an Afro-Asiatic (formerly Hamito-Semitic) language, was officially banned by the Arabs in 997 and survives today only in the Coptic liturgy. It is assumed that the Coptic religious services have their roots in the earliest layers of the Christian ritual of Jerusalem, with some strong admixtures of Syrian influence. It appears also that there was a certain amount of Arabic influence, and some scholars believe that the Coptic ritual may have exercised some influence on Muslim religious practices.
It is assumed but not verified that the Copts inherited a rich musical tradition. Only in most recent times have musical manuscripts or liturgical books with developed musical notation been used for this music. It has been transmitted only orally.
On the basis of present-day performances, much of the Coptic chant consists of melody types, or melodic formulas that serve as starting points for improvisation by singers. Because it would be difficult for a singer to memorize all the religious services, prompters whisper cues to the singers, who then begin the appropriate melodies for a given service.
The Coptic ritual uses a few percussion instruments that resemble ancient Egyptian instruments known from frescoes and reliefs. On this basis some scholars believe that the Coptic liturgy preserves some ancient traits uncorrupted. See also sistrum; stone chimes.
