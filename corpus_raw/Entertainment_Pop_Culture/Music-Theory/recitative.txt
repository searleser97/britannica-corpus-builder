Recitative,  style of monody (accompanied solo song) that emphasizes and indeed imitates the rhythms and accents of spoken language, rather than melody or musical motives. Modeled on oratory, recitative developed in the late 1500s in opposition to the polyphonic, or many-voiced, style of 16th-century choral music.
The earliest operas, such as Jacopo Peri’s Euridice (1600), consisted almost entirely of recitativo arioso, a lyric form of recitative intended to communicate the emotion of the text. In operas of the late 17th century the expression of emotion was left to the lyric outpouring of the aria, and the recitative was used to carry the dialogue and to advance the action of the plot. In oratorios and cantatas it often serves the similar function of advancing the narrative.
Two principal varieties developed. Recitativo secco (“dry recitative”) is sung with a free rhythm dictated by the accents of the words. Accompaniment, usually by continuo (cello and harpsichord), is simple and chordal. The melody approximates speech by using only a few pitches. The second variety, recitativo stromentato, or accompanied recitative, has stricter rhythm and more involved, often orchestral accompaniment. Used at dramatically important moments, it is more emotional in character. Its vocal line is more melodic, and typically it leads into a formal aria.
