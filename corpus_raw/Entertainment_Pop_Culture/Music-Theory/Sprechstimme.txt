Sprechstimme,   (German: “speech-voice”), in music, a cross between speaking and singing in which the tone quality of speech is heightened and lowered in pitch along melodic contours indicated in the musical notation. Sprechstimme is frequently used in 20th-century music.
Its introduction is especially associated with the composer Arnold Schoenberg, who first used it in his Pierrot Lunaire (1912). It had been used earlier, however, in the melodrama Königskinder (1897; Children of the King), by Engelbert Humperdinck.
