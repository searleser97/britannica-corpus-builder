Polyrhythm, also called Cross-rhythm,  the simultaneous combination of contrasting rhythms in a musical composition. Rhythmic conflicts, or cross-rhythms, may occur within a single metre (e.g., two eighth notes against triplet eighths) or may be reinforced by simultaneous combinations of conflicting metres. The latter effect is characteristic of numerous non-Western musical forms (e.g., Indonesian gamelan) and of certain Western, especially American, compositions.
Polyrhythmic and polymetric textures are in fact among the stylistic earmarks of such American composers as Charles Ives and his disciple Elliott Carter. Polyrhythm is also prevalent in American jazz and related Afro-American phenomena, including rock music.
