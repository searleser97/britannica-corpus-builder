Air de cour, (French: “court air”)  genre of French solo or part-song predominant from the late 16th century through the 17th century. It originated in arrangements, for voice and lute, of popular chansons (secular part-songs) written in a light chordal style. Such arrangements were originally known as vau- (or voix-) de-villes (“town voice”), the name air de cour becoming common after its use in 1571 in a collection by Adrian Le Roy and Robert Ballard. Other notable early collections were published by Pierre Attaingnant and Pierre Phalèse; Antoine Boesset, Jean de Cambefort, and Michel Lambert were among the composers included.
Early collections drew heavily on chanson arrangements, but new pieces were also composed explicitly as accompanied solo song. Typically, the air de cour was a strophic song (the same music for all stanzas) written for one or two voices and lute or harpsichord or for four or five unaccompanied voices. There were two repeated sections, and often a refrain; singers often embellished the melody on the repetitions. The texts were usually love poems in stylized language, sometimes in vers mesuré (quantitative verse written in imitation of the poetry of classical antiquity), but they also included drinking songs, religious feats, and other subject matter. Musique mesurée, a short-lived musical style that reflected the metre of vers mesuré in the duration of the musical notes, left its mark on the air de cour in a tendency to use irregular rhythmic patterns. Compare ayre.
