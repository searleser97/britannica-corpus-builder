Modinha,  light and sentimental Portuguese song popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Some of the earliest examples of modinhas are in the Óperas Portuguesas (1733–41) by António José da Silva, who interspersed the songs into the prose dialogue of his dramas. Originally simple melodies, modinhas often were embellished with intricate and elaborate musical effects when performed at court or for the nobility. Modinhas were introduced in Brazil in the late 19th century, where they remained simple expressions of urban life.
