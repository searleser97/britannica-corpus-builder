Canzonet, also called canzonetta, Italian canzonetta, Italian plural canzonette,  form of 16th-century (c. 1565 and later) Italian vocal music. It was the most popular of the lighter secular forms of the period in Italy and England and perhaps in Germany as well. The canzonet follows the canzonetta poetic form; it is strophic (stanzaic) and often in an AABCC pattern. It is considered a refinement of the villanella (a three-voice form imitating rustic music) but bears some resemblance to the more serious madrigal, one of the major forms of the century. It is light in mood, with a clear four- to six-voice texture, and is characterized by dancelike rhythms, some word painting (musical depiction of certain words like “flight” or “fire”), and much use of simple melodic imitation.
Claudio Monteverdi, Luca Marenzio, and other celebrated composers wrote excellent works in this form, but Orazio Vecchi is considered to be the most outstanding canzonet composer. The English composer Thomas Morley and the German Hans Leo Hassler were also important, as they both wrote canzonets in their native tongues.
Although the canzonet was primarily a secular genre, examples with religious texts were also composed. Instrumental accompaniment and even entirely instrumental writing were frequent in later canzonets. They were also sometimes performed as vocal solos with instrumental accompaniment.
