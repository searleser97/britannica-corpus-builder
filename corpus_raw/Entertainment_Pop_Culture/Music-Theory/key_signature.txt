Key signature,  in musical notation, the arrangement of sharp or flat signs on particular lines and spaces of a musical staff to indicate that the corresponding notes, in every octave, are to be consistently raised (by sharps) or lowered (by flats) from their natural pitches. (The keys of C major and A minor, having no sharps or flats, have no key signature.) The key signature is placed after the clef indication (treble or bass, for example) at the beginning of a staff or after a double bar line—the separation necessary for a change of signature—within a staff. In Western tonality, specific groupings represent the major and minor keys.
One flat appears as a key signature in some of the earliest sources that use staff notation, dating from the 11th or 12th century, a practice that survives in printed books of plainchant (see Gregorian chant). The concept was universally adopted with staff notation, but not until the late 18th century was the modern system of keys and associated fixed key signatures fully developed. Beginning in the late 19th century and continuing into the 21st, composers who challenged traditional tonality often used the notation in new ways. Some have marked notes with accidentals throughout, even when using a key signature, and others have mixed sharps and flats in the same signature.
In orchestral scores since the late 18th century (in the music of Joseph Haydn and later composers), different key signatures may appear simultaneously; some of the different instruments require transposition (e.g., fingering a C to sound a B-flat) because of differences in fingering systems (clarinets, for example) or changes in tube length (in horns and trumpets). In some orchestral scores published since the 1920s, however, this practice is not followed, and all instruments are indicated to sound as written.
