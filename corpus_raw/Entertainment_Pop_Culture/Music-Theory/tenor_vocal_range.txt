Tenor,   highest male vocal range, normally extending approximately from the second B below middle C to the G above; an extremely high voice, extending into the alto range, is usually termed a countertenor (q.v.). In instrument families, tenor refers to the instrument of more or less comparable range (e.g., tenor horn).
In the polyphonic (multipart) music of the 13th–16th century, tenor referred to the part “holding” the cantus firmus, the plainsong, or other melody on which a composition was usually built. The highest line above was termed superius (the modern soprano), and the third added voice was termed contratenor. In the mid-15th century, writing in four parts became common, and the contratenor part gave rise to the contratenor altus (the modern alto) and contratenor bassus (the modern bass). The term tenor gradually lost its association with a cantus firmus and began to refer to the part between the alto and bass and to the corresponding vocal range.
Tenor voices are often classified as dramatic, lyric, or heroic (heldentenor). In plainsong recitation of psalms, tenor refers to the reiterated note on which most of the syllables fall.
