time signature,  in musical notation, sign that indicates the metre of a composition. Most time signatures consist of two vertically aligned numbers, such as , , , and . In simple time, the top figure reflects the number of beats in each measure, or metrical unit; the bottom figure indicates the note value that receives one beat (here, respectively, half note, quarter note, eighth note, and sixteenth note). By comparison, compound metres (e.g., duple, as in 6/8 or 6/16, or triple, as in 9/8) have time signatures that indicate the number of beats to be a multiple of three. When measures contain an uneven number of beats falling regularly into two subgroups, the division may be indicated as, for instance,  instead of 
Two other time signatures are common: 𝄴 (common time, or ) and 𝄵 (cut time, or alla breve, ). Both derive from symbols of mensural notation (used from c. 1260 to 1600), the system preceding the modern one.
The mensural time signature 𝄴 indicated a basic unit (tempus) of two notes and the subdivision (prolatio) of these notes into two parts (modern 24 time,  and ). But 𝄴 was a proportion sign indicating that the breve (𝅆; modern double whole note) should take the time formerly occupied by the semibreve (𝆹; modern whole note), hence the name “alla breve.” Other time signatures of mensural notation (and their modern equivalents) were 𝇈 (), 𝇊 (), and 𝇇 ().
