Sinfonia, plural sinfonie,  in music, any of several instrumental forms, primarily of Italian origin. In the earlier Baroque period (mid-17th century), the term was used synonymously with canzona and sonata. For most of the 17th and 18th centuries, the name referred particularly to orchestral introductions to operas and cantatas.
The Italian opera overture, or sinfonia, evolved into the autonomous orchestral symphony by way of a three-part form (fast-slow-fast) that became standard in the late 17th century. Once these contrasting sections had been expanded into relatively self-sufficient movements, little stood in the way of the three-movement symphonies composed in the 1740s by Italians (e.g., Giovanni Battista Sammartini), Austrians (e.g., Matthias Georg Monn), and Germans (e.g., Johann Stamitz) alike. Occasionally the word sinfonia was transferred to nonorchestral media. Thus, Johann Sebastian Bach called his three-part keyboard inventions sinfonie. In the 20th century, the term was revived by Benjamin Britten (Opus 20, 1940) and Luciano Berio (1968) to designate a small orchestral work.
