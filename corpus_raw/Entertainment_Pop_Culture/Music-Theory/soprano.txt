Soprano,   the highest human vocal register, extending approximately from middle C to the second A above. A voice with a range approximately from the A below middle C to the second F or G above is termed a mezzo-soprano. Soprano generally refers to female voices, although it is also applied to boy sopranos (also called trebles) and to male castrati singers of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. In music written in four parts, the soprano part is the highest part. Soprano can also designate a high-pitched member of an instrument family (e.g., soprano saxophone). The term derives from Italian sopra (“above”) and corresponds to the earlier Latin term superius, which in the polyphonic (multipart) music of the 13th–16th century referred to the highest part.
Soprano voices are often classified according to their colour or agility: a dramatic soprano has a rich, powerful quality; a lyric soprano, a lighter, singing tone; and a coloratura soprano possesses a high range (to the second C above middle C and higher) and extreme agility.
