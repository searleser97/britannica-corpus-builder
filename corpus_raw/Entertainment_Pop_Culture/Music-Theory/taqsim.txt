Taqsīm , (Arabic: “division”) also spelled taqasīm or taksim,  one of the principal instrumental genres of Arabic and Turkish classical music. A taqsīm is ordinarily improvised and consists of several sections; it is usually (though not always) nonmetric. A taqsīm may be a movement of a suite, such as the North African nauba or the Turkish fasil, but taqsīms may also be performed alone or as introductory pieces to vocal performances. Performance of a taqsīm may take anywhere from 1 to 15 minutes. A taqsīm is cast in one principal maqām, or mode, but, usually in the course of its performance and once the main maqām has been thoroughly established and explored, the improvising musician modulates for brief periods to other maqāmāt and returns at the end to the original mode. Although any melodic instrument can be used to perform taqsīm, those most often used in Arabic music are the ʿūd (short-necked lute), buzuq (long-necked lute), and qānūn (plucked dulcimer) and in Turkish music, the ney (end-blown flute).
