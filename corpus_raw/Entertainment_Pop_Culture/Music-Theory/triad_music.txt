Triad,  in music, a chord made up of three tones, called chord factors, of the diatonic scale: root, third, and fifth. The system of diatonic triads is the basis of tonal harmony in music.
Triads are classified according to intervals formed above the root. If the factors of the triad are a major third and a perfect fifth above the root, the triad is a major triad; if a minor third and a perfect fifth, it is a minor triad. These are defined as consonant triads. If the third is major and the fifth is augmented, the triad is called an augmented triad; if the third is minor and the fifth is diminished, the triad is a diminished triad. Augmented and diminished triads are dissonant.
In actual music, any factor of a triad may be duplicated and reduplicated in any octave; this is called doubling and is found everywhere in polyphonic music, both vocal and instrumental. As long as the notes are exclusively triadic factors and their octave equivalents, the chord is still considered a triad. For further discussion of triads and their variants, see harmony: Classical Western harmony and chord.
