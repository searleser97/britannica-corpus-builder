Cadenza,   (Italian: “cadence”), unaccompanied bravura passage introduced at or near the close of a movement of a composition and serving as a brilliant climax, particularly in solo concerti of a virtuoso character. Until well into the 19th century such interpolated passages were often improvised by the performer at suitable openings left for that purpose by the composer. They were displays not only of performing skill but also of more or less spontaneous invention and imagination. Modern performers use written-out cadenzas even for classical concerti, and in modern concerti that include cadenzas they are usually written by the composer. See also improvisation.
