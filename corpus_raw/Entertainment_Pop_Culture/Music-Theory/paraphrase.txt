Paraphrase,  in music, the appropriation of a phrase, melody, section, or entire piece for use in another, favoured especially during the Renaissance for masses and motets as well as for keyboard works. The original melody is not generally used as it appeared in its original context but rather is altered by interpolating new notes, by changing the rhythm or the melodic contour, or by condensing or elaborating melodic passages. A paraphrased melody may appear in one voice part of the new composition, as in the motet Alma redemptoris mater (Beloved Mother of the Redeemer) by Guillaume Dufay, or in all voice parts through the technique of melodic imitation, as in the Missa pange lingua (mass on the plainsong hymn “Pange lingua” [“Sing, My Tongue”]) by Josquin des Prez.
In 19th-century music, the term acquired slightly different connotations, when piano and other virtuosos engaged in elaborate paraphrases of operas as well as of each other’s works.
