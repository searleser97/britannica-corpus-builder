Gamut,  in music, the full range of pitches in a musical system; also, the compass of a particular instrument or voice. The word originated with the medieval monk Guido of Arezzo (died 1050) to identify his system of solmization—i.e., of using syllables to denote musical tones in a scale. Thus, to render in syllables the six tones of the hexatonic scale that prevailed, Guido started with the lowest tone recognized in medieval music theory, the second G below middle C, or gamma. For this note he selected the syllable ut from the hymn “Ut queant laxis” and for the ascending tones used the syllables re, mi, fa, sol, and la. Since Guido and his successors conceived musical theory in terms of overlapping hexachords rather than the diatonic scale, the syllable ut could represent any of the three pitches capable of sustaining the overlapping hexachords that made up the system; these were C, F, and G. While ut might vary, there was only one gamma-ut.
Gradually, the word’s meaning was extended to include the whole range from gamma-ut to the high E and contracted to gamut. After diatonic scales displaced the system of overlapping hexachords, gamut came to designate any maximal scale within reach of a given instrument or voice, hence the literary phrase “ranging over the whole gamut of human emotions.” See also hexachord; solmization.
