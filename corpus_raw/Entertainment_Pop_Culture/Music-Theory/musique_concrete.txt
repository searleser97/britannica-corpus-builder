Musique concrète,   (French: “concrete music”), experimental technique of musical composition using recorded sounds as raw material. The technique was developed about 1948 by the French composer Pierre Schaeffer and his associates at the Studio d’Essai (“Experimental Studio”) of the French radio system. The fundamental principle of musique concrète lies in the assemblage of various natural sounds recorded on tape (or, originally, on disks) to produce a montage of sound. During the preparation of such a composition, the sounds selected and recorded may be modified in any way desired—played backward, cut short or extended, subjected to echo-chamber effects, varied in pitch and intensity, and so on. The finished composition thus represents the combination of varied auditory experiences into an artistic unity.
A precursor to the use of electronically generated sound, musique concrète was among the earliest uses of electronic means to extend the composer’s sound resources. The experimental use of machinery in musique concrète, the random use of ingredients, and the absence of the traditional composer-performer roles characterize the technique as a pioneering effort that led to further developments in electronic and computer-produced research in music. Compositions in musique concrète include Symphonie pour un homme seul (1950; Symphony for One Man Only) by Schaeffer and Pierre Henry and Déserts (1954; for tape and instruments) and Poème électronique (performed by 400 loudspeakers at the 1958 Brussels World’s Fair), both by the French-American composer Edgard Varèse.
