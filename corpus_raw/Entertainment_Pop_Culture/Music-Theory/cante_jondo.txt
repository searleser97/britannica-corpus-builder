Cante jondo, (Andalusian Spanish:  “deep song” or “profound song”)  the most serious and deeply moving variety of flamenco, or Spanish Roma, song. The cante jondo developed a distinctive melodic style, the foremost characteristics of which are a narrow range, a predilection for the reiteration of one note in the manner of a recitative (intoned speech), a dramatic use of ornate melodic embellishment, a preoccupation with microtones (intervals smaller than a semitone), and a subtle, intricate rhythm that defies notation. For the place of the cante jondo within the music and dance of the flamenco tradition, see flamenco.
