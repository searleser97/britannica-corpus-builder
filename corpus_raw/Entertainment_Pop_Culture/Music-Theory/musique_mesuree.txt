Musique mesurée,   (French: “measured music”), style of late 16th-century French vocal music in which the duration of the notes reflected the metre of the poetic text. Musique mesurée was one of several late 16th-century attempts to emulate the unity of verse and music supposedly achieved in classical antiquity. It was associated with vers mesurés à l’antique, poetry written to classical quantitative metres (based on long and short syllables).
Musique mesurée was in large part the product of a circle of poets and musicians, the Academy of Poetry and Music, founded in 1570 by Jean-Antoine de Baïf, one of the members of La Pléiade, a prominent group of French poets who drew inspiration from classical literature; also associated with the academy was the principal poet of the period and the most influential member of La Pléiade, Pierre de Ronsard. To forward the cause of musique mesurée, the academy sponsored concerts, a number of which were attended by its patron, King Charles IX.
Songs in musique mesurée were generally set for five voices and were at first sung unaccompanied; instruments were later permitted. Long syllables were set to notes twice as long as short syllables; all voice parts shared the same text, so that the music moved in chords and in flexible rhythms determined by the accentuation of the text. This rhythmic freedom influenced another important genre, the air de cour (“court air”), part-song or solo song with lute accompaniment.
Musique mesurée imposed considerable limitations on the composer, but the technique was utilized with unusual flexibility and effectiveness by Claude Le Jeune, one of the truly masterful musicians of the period. Jacques Mauduit and Eustache Du Caurroy were also prominent composers of musique mesurée.
