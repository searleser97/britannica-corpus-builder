Cello Concerto in B Minor, Op. 104,  concerto for cello and orchestra by Antonín Dvořák, premiered in London on March 19, 1896. It is one of the most frequently performed of all cello concerti, and it is admired for the richness of its orchestral music and for the lyrical writing for the solo instrument.
The concerto follows a typical structure of three movements of fast, slow, and fast tempi. It opens with a broad orchestral statement, bringing in the soloist after the initial themes are introduced. At this point, the soloist restates those themes in a new and more elaborate fashion.
The melancholy second movement quotes a theme from one of Dvořák’s own songs, “Lasst mich allein” (German: “Leave Me Alone”). The song had been a particular favourite of the composer’s sister-in-law Josefina, who had recently died. Having loved Josefina before he consented to marry her sister Anna, Dvořák here paid tribute to his first love. For the final movement, Dvořák builds a rondo structure upon a jaunty marchlike theme. In its final bars, brief recapitulations of melodies from the previous movements are heard.
