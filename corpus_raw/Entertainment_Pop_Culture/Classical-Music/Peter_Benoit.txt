Peter Benoit, in full Peter Léonard Léopold Benoit,  (born Aug. 17, 1834, Harelbeke, Belg.—died  March 8, 1901, Antwerp), Belgian composer and teacher who was responsible for the modern renaissance of Flemish music.
Benoit studied with François-Joseph Fétis at the Brussels Conservatory and in 1857 won the Prix de Rome. He traveled in Germany and in 1861 went to France, where he conducted at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Upon his return to Belgium in 1863, Benoit came under the influence of the novelist Hendrik Conscience. Thereafter he was an ardent proponent of a Flemish national movement in music, and he published numerous articles and pamphlets propagandizing Flemish music. In 1867 in Antwerp he founded the Flemish School of Music (later the Royal Flemish Conservatory), which he directed until his death.
His compositions include his Rubens-cantata (1877), which evoked historical events in Antwerp; the operas Het dorp in’t gebergte (1857; “The Mountain Village”) and Pompeja (1895); the oratorio Lucifer (1866), considered his masterpiece; the children’s oratorio De waereld in (1878; “In the World”); and the Quadrilogie religieuse (1864). In his late compositions he turned away from his previous models, composers Hector Berlioz and Giacomo Meyerbeer, and cultivated a style of studied simplicity. This is particularly notable in the choral writing in his late cantatas, such as the Ledeganckcantate (1897).
