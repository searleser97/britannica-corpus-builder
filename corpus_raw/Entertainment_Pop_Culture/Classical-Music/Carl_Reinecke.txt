Carl Reinecke, in full Carl Heinrich Carsten Reinecke,  (born June 23, 1824, Altona, near Hamburg [Germany]—died  March 10, 1910, Leipzig), German pianist, composer, conductor, and teacher who sought, in his works and teaching, to preserve the Classical tradition in the late 19th century.
After study with his father, Reinecke made several concert tours. He taught counterpoint and piano at the Cologne Conservatory (1851–54) and was music director first at Barmen (1854–59), then at Breslau University (1859–60). He held the important posts of conductor of Leipzig’s Gewandhaus Orchestra (1860–95) and teacher of piano and composition at the Leipzig Conservatory from 1860, while he continued to make annual concert tours. He became the Conservatory’s director in 1897. He was one of the most influential musicians of his time, counting among his students Edvard Grieg, Hugo Riemann, Arthur Sullivan, and Felix Weingartner. He wrote works for orchestra (symphonies, overtures, concertos), piano, and voice, as well as chamber music and works for the stage.
