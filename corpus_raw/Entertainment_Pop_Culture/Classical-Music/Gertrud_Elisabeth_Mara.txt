Gertrud Elisabeth Mara, née Schmeling,  (born Feb. 23, 1749, Kassel, Landgraviate Hesse-Kassel [Germany]—died  Jan. 20, 1833, Revel [now Tallinn], Estonia, Russian Empire), German soprano of great technical ability, who was one of the few non-Italians of the time to gain a great international reputation.
A child prodigy, Schmeling gave violin recitals accompanied by her father, a violin maker, in Vienna and London, where at the age of 10 she played for the queen. At the advice of an attendant at court, she began to study voice under Pietro Paradisi in London. She sang in Johann Hiller’s concerts in Leipzig in 1766, performed with the Dresden Opera, then moved to Berlin, where, overcoming Frederick II’s dislike for German singers, she was engaged in 1771 by the court opera. In 1774 she married a cellist, Johann Baptist Mara, and the couple, seeking twice to escape the despotic prince’s court, finally succeeded in doing so without retribution in 1779.
In 1780 Mara toured the continent, failing to impress Mozart and engaging in a fierce rivalry with Luiza Todi in Paris (1783) before moving to London in 1784. She was outstandingly successful there in 1787 as Cleopatra in George Frideric Handel’s Giulio Cesare. She sang in Venice and Turin in 1788, then returned to London. She was praised for her performances in the oratorios of Handel and Joseph Haydn. In 1803 she moved to Moscow, where she acquired considerable property, only to lose it during the burning of the city in 1812. Her last years were spent in Tallinn, where she gave music lessons.
