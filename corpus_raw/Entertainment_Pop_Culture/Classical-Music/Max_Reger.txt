Max Reger, byname of Johann Baptist Joseph Maximilian Reger,  (born March 19, 1873, Brand, Bavaria, Ger.—died  May 11, 1916, Leipzig), German composer and teacher noted for his organ works, which use Baroque forms; he was one of the last composers to infuse life into 19th-century musical traditions.
Reger studied at Weiden. In 1888 he heard Die Meistersinger and Parsifal at Bayreuth, but Wagnerian influence on his music was short-lived. From 1890 to 1893 he studied at Sondershausen and Wiesbaden and taught piano, organ, and theory. About this time he became friends with Busoni and with the organist Straube, who introduced Reger’s organ music. By 1901, despite opposition to his traditional methods, he had established himself in Munich as a composer, pianist, and teacher. In 1907 he became professor of composition at the Leipzig Conservatory and musical director at the University of Leipzig. He took on the post of conductor of the court orchestra at Meiningen in 1911.
In addition to organ works, Reger also composed choral and orchestral works, chamber music, and songs. Among his leading orchestral works are the Böcklin Suite, the Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart, the Suite in the Old Style, and variations on themes of Beethoven and Hiller. There are also a piano concerto, sonatas for unaccompanied violin, three suites for solo viola, and other works. His organ works include the fantasy on Ein feste Burg; Phantasie und Fuge über B-A-C-H; the fantasy on the chorale Wachet auf! ruft uns die Stimme; and the Sonata in F Sharp Minor.
Reger influenced such composers as Arthur Honegger and Paul Hindemith.
