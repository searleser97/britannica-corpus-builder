Rodolphe Kreutzer,  (born Nov. 16, 1766, Versailles, France—died  Jan. 6, 1831, Geneva, Switz.), composer and violinist, one of the founders of the French school of violin playing, and one of the foremost improvisers and conductors of his day.
Kreutzer was a pupil of the influential composer and conductor Anton Stamitz and in 1795 became professor of the violin at the Paris Conservatory. In 1798 in Vienna he met Beethoven, who admired his playing above that of any other virtuoso. Without Kreutzer’s knowledge, Beethoven dedicated to him his Sonata in A Major for Piano and Violin, Opus 47 (published 1805)—now known as the Kreutzer Sonata—but Kreutzer apparently never played the work in public. He held solo violin positions at the Théâtre-Italien and the Paris Opéra and later was chamber musician to Napoleon and to Louis XVIII, although his career as a soloist was cut short by a carriage accident in 1810. He wrote about 40 operas—of which Lodoïska (1791) was particularly popular—several ballets, 19 violin concerti, and many chamber works. His Méthode du violon, written with the violinists Pierre Baillot and Pierre Rode, and his 40 Études ou caprices remain standard exercises for the violin.
