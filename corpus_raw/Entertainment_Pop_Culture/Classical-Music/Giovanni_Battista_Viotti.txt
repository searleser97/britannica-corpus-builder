Giovanni Battista Viotti,  (born May 12, 1755, Fontanetto da Po, Piedmontâ€”died  March 3, 1824, London), Italian violinist and composer, principal founder of the 19th-century school of violin playing.
In 1766 Viotti went to Turin, where he studied with the virtuoso Gaetano Pugnani after 1770. He travelled with Pugnani in Germany, Poland, and Russia and made his debut in Paris as a violinist in 1782. He became court musician to Marie-Antoinette and established himself as a teacher and opera impresario. In 1792 he went to London, where he conducted Italian operas and appeared as soloist in his own violin concerti at the Salomon Concerts. Accused of Jacobin sympathies, he went to Germany in 1798 but had returned to London by 1801 to resume his wine business, continuing to perform and compose privately as well. Following the failure of the business, he worked in Paris as director of the Italian opera from 1819 to 1822, after which he returned to London.
Viotti greatly developed the violin concerto, using the sonata form and a skilled orchestration. He wrote 29 violin concerti, of which No. 22 in A Minor became especially well known after Joseph Joachim revived it in the 1870s; 10 piano concerti, some of them transcriptions of the violin concerti; and string quartets and other chamber works.
