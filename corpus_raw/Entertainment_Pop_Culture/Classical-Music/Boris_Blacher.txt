Boris Blacher,  (born Jan. 19 [Jan. 6, Old Style], 1903, Niu-ch’ang, China—died  Jan. 30, 1975, West Berlin, W.Ger.), German composer who was best known for his instrumental music but was noted also for operas and ballets.
Of German-Baltic descent, Blacher studied music in Irkutsk (Siberia) and Harbin, China, before going to Berlin in 1922. There he studied and taught before falling out of favour with the Nazis. After World War II he became professor (1948–70) at the Academy of Music in West Berlin and served as its director (1953–70). In 1955 he was appointed a regular member of the West Berlin Academy of Arts music section, where he served as director from 1961. He was president of the academy from 1968 to 1971.
Blacher was equally successful in the use of traditional forms and modernistic techniques. The first of his large-scale theatre works written in the 12-tone method was the ballet Lysistrata (1950). Other important stage works include the chamber opera Romeo und Julia (1943) and the surrealist Rosamunde Floris (1960). In the 1960s he began to use electronic resources in his compositions. It was, however, the more traditional Variations on a Theme of Paganini for orchestra (1947) that established his reputation.
