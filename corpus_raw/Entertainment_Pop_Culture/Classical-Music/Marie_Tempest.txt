Dame Marie Tempest, original name Marie Susan Etherington,  (born July 15, 1864, London—died  Oct. 15, 1942, London), English actress, known as “the queen of her profession,” who had a 55-year career as a star of light opera and legitimate comedy.
Tempest was educated on the European continent but returned to London to study voice with Manuel Garcia, the tutor of Jenny Lind. She debuted in 1885 as Fiametta in the operetta Boccaccio, but it was the title role in Dorothy (1887), which ran for 931 performances, that established her reputation. In 1890 she appeared in New York City as Kitty Carol in The Red Hussar and continued to tour the United States and Canada in such operettas as The Bohemian Girl, Pirates of Penzance, and The Fencing Master; during this period she was considered one of the few rivals of Lillian Russell. In 1895 George Edwardes bought out her American bookings so that she could return to London to star in An Artist’s Model, which ran for 400 performances.
In 1899 Tempest forsook operettas for straight comedy; in 1900 she created the role of Nell Gwynne in English Nell, followed by Peg Woffington, Becky Sharp, and Polly Eccles in Caste. These and other roles provided the opportunity to combine charm and “roguishness”—a unique quality in which she excelled. In 1908 Somerset Maugham’s Mrs. Dot provided her with her finest role. After World War I she toured throughout the empire until 1922. Nöel Coward wrote the role of Judith Bliss in Hay Fever (1925) especially for her, and her popularity in Passing Brompton Road, The Cat’s Cradle, and The First Mrs. Fraser continued unabated. She toured Great Britain in the latter role only one year prior to her death. In May 1935 she celebrated her stage jubilee with a benefit that was attended by the king and queen. The proceeds were donated to St. George’s Hospital for use by members of the theatrical profession. She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1937.
