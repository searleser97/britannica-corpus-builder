Sir Andrzej Panufnik,  (born Sept. 24, 1914, Warsaw, Pol.—died  Oct. 27, 1991, Twickenham, Greater London, Eng.), Polish-born British composer and conductor, who created compositions in a distinctive contemporary Polish style though he worked in a wide variety of genres.
Panufnik’s father was an instrument maker, and his mother a violinist and his first teacher. He began composing at age nine, studied composition at the Warsaw Conservatory (1932–36), and studied conducting with Felix Weingartner at the Vienna Academy (1937–38). He then completed his studies in Paris and London and returned to Warsaw, where, during World War II, he had to lie low, performing occasionally as a pianist in underground concerts. All his early works were destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising (1944), but he was able to reconstruct some of them.
Panufnik conducted the Kraków Philharmonic (1945–46) and the Warsaw Philharmonic (1946–47) and from 1947 was guest conductor with a number of European orchestras. His compositions were gaining attention also and won a number of awards; the Polish communist officials, however, began criticizing the style and content of his works, and he defected to Britain in 1954. (He became a naturalized British subject in 1961.) Panufnik was musical director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (1957–59) and then devoted himself to his own compositions, which included 10 symphonies, various other orchestral works, concerti, chamber works, and choral and vocal works. In September 1990, after the overthrow of communism, Panufnik returned to Poland for the first time in 36 years and conducted the European premiere of his last symphony.
Panufnik’s autobiography, Composing Myself, was published in 1987, and he was knighted in 1991.
