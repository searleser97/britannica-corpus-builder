Prelude,   musical composition, usually brief, that is generally played as an introduction to another, larger musical piece. The term is applied generically to any piece preceding a religious or secular ceremony, including in some instances an operatic performance. In the 17th century, organists in particular began to write loosely structured preludes to rigorously conceived fugues. The most notable composer of preludes, J.S. Bach, gave each prelude its own distinct character; some are akin to arias, others to dance forms, toccatas, or inventions.
The preludes of Frédéric Chopin and Claude Debussy are brief, self-contained pieces that vary widely in character but that often explore a particular mood. Chopin wrote études that differ little structurally from some of his preludes, while Debussy’s two books of preludes bear descriptive titles reflecting their evocative, sometimes rhapsodic moods, a quality captured perhaps more perfectly in Debussy’s brilliant orchestral Prélude à l’aprés-midi d’un faune (Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun). Preludes and fugues written in the 20th century include notably those of the Russian composer Dmitry Shostakovich. A variety of modern piano suites (e.g., Opus 25, Arnold Schoenberg’s dodecaphonic work) also open with preludes, generally monothematic pieces intended to evoke the spirit and practice of the early 18th century.
