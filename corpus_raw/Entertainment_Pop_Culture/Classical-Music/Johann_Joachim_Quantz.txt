Johann Joachim Quantz,  (born Jan. 30, 1697, Oberscheden, near Göttingen [Germany]—died  July 12, 1773, Potsdam, Brandenburg), German composer and flute virtuoso who left an important treatise on the flute and who made mechanical improvements in the instrument.
Quantz obtained posts at Radeberg and Dresden and in 1717 studied counterpoint in Vienna with Johann Zelenka and Johann Fux. In 1718 he became oboist in the Polish court chapel. About this time he began to play the flute. In 1728 he became flute instructor to the Crown Prince of Prussia, later Frederick the Great, who after becoming king in 1740 persuaded Quantz in 1741 to settle in Berlin as chamber musician and court composer.
Quantz composed about 300 concerti and 200 other flute pieces for Frederick the Great. His treatise on playing the transverse flute, Versuch einer Anweisung die Flöte traversiere zu spielen (1752), was reprinted many times. It contains valuable information on ornamentation and performance practices of the 18th century. He added a second key to the flute and invented the sliding end used to tune the instrument.
