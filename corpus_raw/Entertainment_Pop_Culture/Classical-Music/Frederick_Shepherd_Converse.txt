Frederick Shepherd Converse,  (born Jan. 5, 1871, Newton, Mass., U.S.—died  June 8, 1940, Westwood, Mass.), American composer whose essentially Romantic music is coloured with chromaticism and advanced harmonies.
Converse studied with John Knowles Paine and George Chadwick, two members of a conservative, German-influenced group of American composers, and his early works reveal their imprint. Later he studied in Munich at the Royal Academy of the Art of Music. He taught at Harvard University (1901–07) and at the New England Conservatory of Music (1899–1901, 1930–38). His opera, The Pipe of Desire (1906), in 1910 became the first opera by an American composer to be staged by the Metropolitan Opera Company, New York. Although his early works were conservative, he adopted a somewhat modern idiom in the symphonic fantasy Flivver Ten Million (1927), written to celebrate the production of the 10,000,000th Ford automobile. He also wrote six symphonies, chamber music, and many songs.
