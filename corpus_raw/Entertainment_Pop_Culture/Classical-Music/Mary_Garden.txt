Mary Garden,  (born Feb. 20, 1874, Aberdeen, Scot.—died  Jan. 3, 1967, Aberdeen), soprano famous for her vivid operatic portrayals. She was noted for her acting as well as her singing and was an important figure in American opera.
Garden went to the United States from Scotland with her parents when she was seven and began studying violin and piano and receiving voice lessons at an early age. In 1897 she traveled to Paris to continue her voice training. A soprano, she made her public debut there in April 1900 in Gustave Charpentier’s Louise at the Opéra-Comique when, as understudy, she filled in for the stricken regular soprano. She was an immediate success and subsequently sang in La traviata and other operas. In April 1902 she was chosen by Claude Debussy to sing the female lead in the premiere of his Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique, and her interpretation of that role became her most famous.
Among Garden’s other major roles were those in Le Jongleur de Notre-Dame (Jules Massenet rewrote the tenor part for her); Massenet’s Thaïs, in which she made her American debut at the Manhattan Opera House in November 1907; Richard Strauss’s Salomé, in which she created a sensation; Henri Février’s Monna Vanna; and Italo Montemezzi’s L’amore dei tre re. She was acclaimed not only for her brilliant and highly individual singing but also for her remarkable dramatic ability. She joined the Chicago Civic Opera in 1910 and starred with it until 1931, serving also as general director of the Chicago Opera Association in 1921–22. She retired from the operatic stage in 1931 but remained active for 20 years more in musical circles, making numerous national lecture and recital tours. Her autobiography, Mary Garden’s Story, written with Louis Biancolli, appeared in 1951.
