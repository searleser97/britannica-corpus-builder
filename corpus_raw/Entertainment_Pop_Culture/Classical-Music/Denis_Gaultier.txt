Denis Gaultier, also called Gaultier le Jeune (“the Younger”),  (born 1597 or 1603, Marseille?—died  January 1672, Paris, France), celebrated lute virtuoso whose style influenced the French school of harpsichord music.
Gaultier came from a renowned family of lutenists. Little is known of his life except that he resided for many years in Paris. He was the last great representative of the Parisian school of lutenists prominent in the early and middle years of the Baroque era. His music explores the full range of the French style—graceful and subtle ornamentation, broken chords, skillful exploitation of the lute’s resources to suggest polyphonic texture. These facets of the lute style were transferred to the keyboard in the compositions of Jacques Champion de Chambonnières and the later clavecinistes, as were also the characteristic arrangement of stylized dances into suites and the fanciful and descriptive titles given to the individual pieces. The suites also influenced the keyboard style of Johann Jakob Froberger. Gaultier’s compositions include the Pièces de luth and a collection of 56 compositions arranged in suites, in 11 of the 12 modes (the Lydian is missing), La Rhétorique des dieux (compiled between 1648 and 1652; “The Rhetoric of the Gods”). He was hugely popular in his own time, and much of his music was transcribed from lute tablature into staff notation so that it might reach the growing public of keyboard players. Gaultier also popularized the tombeau, a small piece written to the memory of a great personage.
