Artur Rodzinsky,  (born Jan. 1, 1892, Spalato, Dalmatia, Austria-Hungary [now Split, Croatia]—died Nov. 27, 1958, Boston, Mass., U.S.), American conductor of Polish descent who was known for his ability to rejuvenate orchestras.
Rodzinsky pursued advanced musical studies while taking a law degree at Vienna University, subsequently conducting in his home city of Lwów in Galicia. The year 1921 saw his Warsaw debut, and in 1925 he made his American debut with the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra. He returned to Philadelphia the following year to become Leopold Stokowski’s assistant. In 1929 Rodzinsky joined the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and in 1933, the year he became a U.S. citizen, he began a decade with the Cleveland Orchestra, which he developed into a first-rate ensemble. A much sought-after guest conductor through the 1930s, he was invited in 1937 to assemble and train the NBC orchestra. He took charge of the New York Philharmonic in 1942 with changes that were major, swift, and beneficial, though friction with the management brought about his resignation in 1947. A similar chain of events led to his dismissal from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra only a year later. Disenchanted and ailing, Rodzinsky made his way to Italy, where he found particular success conducting opera.
