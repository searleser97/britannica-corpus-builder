Johann Ludwig Krebs,  (born Oct. 10, 1713, Buttelstedt, Saxony [Germany]—died  Jan. 1, 1780, Altenburg), German organist and composer noted for his organ music.
Krebs studied under his father and was later a favourite pupil of the composer Johann Sebastian Bach at Leipzig. He was organist at Zwickau, Zeitz, and Altenburg. His organ music is composed in the forms used by Bach and leans heavily on Bach’s style. It is technically very accomplished. Krebs also wrote trio sonatas, sonatas for flute and harpsichord, and some sacred vocal music.
