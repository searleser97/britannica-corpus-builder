Sir Henry Rowley Bishop,  (born Nov. 18, 1786, London, Eng.—died  April 30, 1855, London), English composer and conductor remembered for his songs “Home, Sweet Home” and “Lo, Here the Gentle Lark.”
Bishop composed, arranged, and conducted dramatic musical productions at Covent Garden Theatre (1810–24), King’s Theatre, Haymarket (1816–17), Drury Lane (from 1825), and Vauxhall Gardens (1830). He became professor of music successively at the Universities of Edinburgh (1841) and Oxford (1848) and was knighted in 1842. Bishop composed light operas and incidental music for plays and arranged operas by well-known composers. He wrote one opera with sung dialogue, Aladdin (1826), as well as oratorios, part-songs, and glees. His “Home, Sweet Home,” with lyrics by John Howard Payne, was the theme song from his comic opera, a musical version of Payne’s play Clari, or The Maid of Milan.
