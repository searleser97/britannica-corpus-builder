Jean Barraqué,  (born Jan. 17, 1928, Puteaux, France—died Aug. 17, 1973, Paris), French composer. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Jean Langlais (1907–91) and Olivier Messiaen. His major work, employing a radically nonrepetitive style, was a planned five-part reflection on Hermann Broch’s novel The Death of Virgil, of which he completed three parts— . . . au-delà du hasard (1959), Chant après chant (1966), and Le Temps restitué (1968)—before his early death. He also composed a long piano sonata (1952) and a clarinet concerto (1968).
