Domenico Alberti,  (born c. 1710, Venice [Italy]—died  1740, Formia or Rome), Venetian composer whose harpsichord sonatas depend heavily on an accompaniment pattern of broken, or arpeggiated, chords known as the Alberti bass.
Alberti studied under the composer Antonio Lotti and was known in Rome as a singer and harpsichordist. Although he probably did not originate the Alberti bass, he consistently used it. This accompaniment pattern sets the melody against a gently moving harmonic background, satisfying the contemporary aesthetic taste for melodic predominance. It was frequently used by Joseph Haydn, Ludwig van Beethoven, and W.A. Mozart (an example is the first movement of Mozart’s Piano Sonata in C Major, K 279) and also appears in 19th-century compositions. Alberti’s sonatas were plagiarized by the singer and harpsichordist Giuseppe Jozzi, who had been Alberti’s pupil.
