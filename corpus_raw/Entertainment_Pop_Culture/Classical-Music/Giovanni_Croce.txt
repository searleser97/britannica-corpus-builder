Giovanni Croce, also called Chiozzotto,  (born c. 1557, Chioggia, near Venice [Italy]—died May 15, 1609, Venice), composer who, with Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, was one of the leading Venetian composers of his day.
Croce was a priest by 1585. About 1593 he became assistant choirmaster at St. Mark’s, and in 1603 choirmaster. His madrigals and canzonets (published in seven books, 1585–1607), though conservative in style, were widely admired for their light touch and alert rhythms. His sacred music (published 1591–1622) shows a development from the even-textured style of Palestrina to the more modern Venetian style of his day, using multiple choruses, solo voices, crisp instrumental rhythms, and basso continuo (reinforced bass line and improvised chords for harmonic support).
