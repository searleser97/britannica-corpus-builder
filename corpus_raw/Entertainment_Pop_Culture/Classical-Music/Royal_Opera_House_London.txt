Royal Opera House,  opera house that is the home of Britain’s oldest national opera and ballet companies. It is located in Covent Garden, City of Westminster, London.
The Covent Garden Theatre, the original theatre on the site, was opened (1732) by John Rich and served for plays, pantomimes, and opera. During the 1730s, when George Frideric Handel was associated with the theatre, opera was emphasized, but later the focus shifted to plays. Managers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries included the noted actors George Colman the Elder, John Philip Kemble, and Charles Kemble. The structure burned in 1808 and was rebuilt in 1809. In 1847 it became the Royal Italian Opera House under the noted conductor Michael Costa and, later, Frederick Gye. The building burned in 1856, and a new building was opened in 1858. The Royal Italian Opera failed in 1884 and was replaced in 1888 by what came to be called the Royal Opera Company under Augustus Harris and, later, Maurice Grau; the repertoire was largely Italian opera.
The house closed during World War I but reopened in 1919. In 1933–39 the resident company was directed by the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. Closed again during World War II, the house reopened in 1946. The Sadler’s Wells Ballet (founded 1931; later the Royal Ballet) moved to the theatre at that time. Postwar musical directors included the conductors Rafael Kubelík, Georg Solti, Colin Davis, and Bernard Haitink. The building itself, which continues to serve the Royal Ballet and the Royal Opera, was greatly augmented by a southward extension in the 1980s.
