William Jackson,  (born May 29, 1730, Exeter, Devon, Eng.—died  July 5, 1803, Exeter), English composer and writer on music, whose opera The Lord of the Manor (1780) held the stage for many years.
Jackson was organist and choirmaster at Exeter cathedral from 1777. His best-known other compositions are Twelve Songs (1755) and Twelve Canzonets for Two Voices (c. 1770). His name is also associated with an Anglican service of dubious authenticity, “Jackson in F,” written in simple style for provincial singers. His writings—which were often at odds with those of Charles Burney—include Observations on the Present State of Music in London (1791), in which he wrote against the craze for George Frideric Handel then in sway; Thirty Letters on Various Subjects (1782); and his autobiography, The Four Ages (1798; republished in The Leisure Hour, 1882). An amateur painter, he was a friend of Thomas Gainsborough.
