Rudolf Serkin,  (born March 28, 1903, Eger, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now Cheb, Czech Republic]—died May 8, 1991, Guilford, Vermont, U.S.), Austrian-born American pianist and teacher who concentrated on the music of J.S. Bach, W.A. Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, and Johannes Brahms.
A student of Richard Robert (piano) and of Joseph Marx and Arnold Schoenberg (composition), Serkin made his debut with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra at the age of 12. Following important performances in Berlin with the Busch Chamber Orchestra, he settled in Basel in 1926. In 1933 he gave his first American performance, and he moved to the United States permanently in 1939. He became known for his chamber music performances, which began during his association with Adolf Busch in the 1920s. His playing was characterized by faithfulness to the text and classical clarity. Serkin served on the piano faculty of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia from 1939 to 1975, and in 1949 he helped found the Marlboro Festival in Vermont. Serkin’s son Peter also became a successful concert pianist.
