Archduke Trio, byname of Piano Trio No. 7 in B-flat Major, Op. 97, German Erzherzog-Trio or Erzherzogtrio,  trio for piano, violin, and cello by Ludwig van Beethoven, which premiered on April 11, 1814, in Vienna. The premiere of the Archduke Trio was one of Beethoven’s final concert performances as a pianist, because of his increasing deafness. Dedicated to Archduke Rudolf of Austria—Beethoven’s benefactor, student, and friend—it was the last of Beethoven’s piano trios, and it remains one of his best-known chamber works.
The composer himself was the pianist at the premiere, which was given as part of a charity concert in Vienna. It was one of Beethoven’s final concert appearances as a performer, for his increasing deafness made it virtually impossible for him to play. Some observers at the premiere commented on a lack of clarity and precision in his technique, yet the composition itself was roundly praised, and the composer’s friends recounted later that the experience led him to discontinue public performances.
Structured in four movements, rather than three as was more customary for chamber works, the trio is in grand concept almost a symphony for three musicians, more than just a trio. Its first movement is a majestic sonata form in which the piano is often the most prominent of the players. Melodies often begin in the piano before moving to one or the other of the strings for further elaboration. The second movement is a carefree scherzo in which the strings begin with dancelike themes that only belatedly move to the piano. Its middle section is more darkly dramatic, before the return of the playful opening theme. A serene and songlike andante, with initial focus upon the piano, appears with the third movement. Nimbler lines occupy the central section of that movement, though sorrowful moods dominate the movement’s closing. Those sorrows are quickly dispelled by the playful, almost jolly aura of the final movement.
