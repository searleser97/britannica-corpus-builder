George Enesco, French Georges Enescu,  (born August 19, 1881, Liveni, near Dorohoi, Romania—died May 4, 1955, Paris, France), Romanian violinist and composer, known for his interpretations of Bach and his eclectic compositions.
At age seven Enesco went to the Vienna Conservatory, where he studied violin. In 1894 he became acquainted with Johannes Brahms, whose formal symphonic developments he later took as a model. In 1895 he went to Paris, where he studied composition and violin. In 1898 his Poème roumain was played in Paris, and in 1899 he won the first prize for violin at the Paris Conservatory. He then began his career as a virtuoso violinist and became widely known for his interpretations of Bach. He was also known as a conductor.
Enesco’s chamber works included three violin sonatas (the last in the popular Romanian style), three piano sonatas, and two string quartets. Among his orchestral works were three symphonies, two Romanian rhapsodies, and an overture on Romanian folk themes. National themes are also used in his opera Oedipe (1936). In his later years he became the leader of the Romanian school of composers. He was also greatly respected as a violin teacher.
