V.G. Jog, in full Vishnu Govind Jog,  (born February 22, 1922, Satara district, Maharashtra, British India [now Maharashtra, India]—died January 31, 2004, Kolkata, India), Indian violinist who is credited with introducing the violin into the Hindustani classical music tradition.
Jog’s music education began when he was 12 years old. He trained under several noted musicians, including musicologist S.N. Ratanjanker and the sarod player Allauddin Khan, father and teacher of Ali Akbar Khan. In addition to his private training, Jog attended the Marris College of Music (now Bhatkhande Music Institute; M.A., 1944) in Lucknow, one of the first institutions to formalize the study of traditional music. He received supplementary training in the Gwalior, Agra, and Bakhale gharanas (communities of performers who share a distinctive musical style) and developed his own characteristic style that combined elements of all three.
He taught for a time and joined All India Radio in 1953 as a music producer. He performed at concert halls worldwide, including three of New York City’s major venues—Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and Madison Square Garden. Among Jog’s many honours were a Sangeet Natak Akademi (India’s national academy of music, dance, and drama) award in 1980 and a Padma Bhushan, one of India’s highest civilian honours, in 1983.
