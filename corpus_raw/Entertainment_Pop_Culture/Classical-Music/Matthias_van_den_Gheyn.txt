Matthias van den Gheyn,  (born April 7, 1721, Tirlemont, Austrian Netherlands [now Tienen, Belg.]—died  June 22, 1785, Leuven [now in Belgium]), Flemish organist, composer, and an outstanding virtuoso of the carillon, particularly known for his brilliant improvisations.
He was born into a celebrated family of Flemish bell founders. He moved with his family to Leuven in 1726 and probably received his first musical education from Abbé Dieudonné Raick, then organist at the Church of St. Peter. He replaced his teacher in that post in 1741. After the death of the town carillonneur, a public competition was held, and van den Gheyn, who was the easy winner, assumed the post on July 1, 1745. He remained in Leuven in charge of the organ and carillon until his death.
Van den Gheyn’s compositions are in the tradition of George Frideric Handel. Several of his harpsichord and organ compositions were printed in his lifetime, along with a treatise on basso continuo. In addition, many compositions for harpsichord, organ, and carillon and a second treatise on harmony remain in manuscript.
