Francesco Cilea,  (born July 26, 1866, Palmi, Italy—died  Nov. 20, 1950, Varazze, near Genoa), Italian composer whose operas are distinguished by their melodic charm.
While studying at the Naples Conservatory, Cilea produced an opera, Gina, which secured for him a commission from a publisher. His first important work, L’Arlesiana (1897), after Alphonse Daudet, was the vehicle for the tenor Enrico Caruso’s first success. Cilea’s best-known work, Adriana Lecouvreur, followed in 1902. Cilea was director of the Naples Conservatory from 1916 to 1935. In addition to operas he composed some chamber music.
