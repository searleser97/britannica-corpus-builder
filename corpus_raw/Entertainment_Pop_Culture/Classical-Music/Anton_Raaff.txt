Anton Raaff, Raaff also spelled Raaf,  (baptized May 6, 1714, Gelsdorf, near Bonn—died May 28, 1797, Munich), German operatic tenor, one of the foremost of his day.
Raaff received some vocal experience while being trained for the priesthood as a young man, then in 1736 he began studying with Giovanni Battista Ferrandini in Munich and later with Antonio Bernacchi of Bologna. His career over the next several years took him to Florence, Venice, Bonn, Lisbon, and Madrid. In Madrid he worked under the direction of the renowned castrato Farinelli, at whose invitation he moved to Naples in 1759. He spent the next decade as the foremost tenor in the opera houses there and in Florence.
In 1770 Raaff returned to Germany to the court of the elector Karl Theodor in Mannheim, where he premiered the title roles in two operas of Johann Christian Bach—Temistocle in 1772 and Lucio Silla in 1774. While in Mannheim in 1777 he was introduced to a young composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who reset the aria “Se al labbro mio non credi” for him. (Although he was sharply critical of Raaff’s singing and acting, Mozart recognized the political importance of currying favour with the influential singer.) Raaff was so pleased with the aria that he arranged for Mozart to be given an opera commission by Karl Theodor. The result was Idomeneo, first performed in 1781 in Munich with Raaff in the title role.
