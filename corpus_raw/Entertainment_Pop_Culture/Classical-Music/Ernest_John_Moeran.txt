Ernest John Moeran,  (born Dec. 31, 1894, Heston and Isleworth, Middlesex, Eng.—died  Dec. 1, 1950, near Kenmare, County Kerry, Ire.), composer whose music reflects English and Irish roots.
Moeran studied at the Royal College of Music (1913–14) and with John Ireland (1920–23) and was influenced by Frederick Delius. Much influenced also by folk song, he made arrangements of tunes that he collected in Norfolk and Suffolk. His solo and choral songs include settings of poems by William Shakespeare, Robert Herrick, A.E. Housman, and James Joyce. Among his more ambitiously designed works are the Symphony in G Minor, concerti for violin and cello, and several chamber works, many of which show the influence of Jean Sibelius. Although limited in emotional range and thematic invention, his larger works are well-sustained and are meticulously polished in their form and the varied musical textures they display.
