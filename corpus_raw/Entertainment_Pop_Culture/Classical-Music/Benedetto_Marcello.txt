Benedetto Marcello,  (born June 24 or July 24, 1686, Venice—died  July 24, 1739, Brescia, Rep. of Venice), Italian composer and writer, especially remembered for two works: the satirical pamphlet Il teatro alla moda (1720); and Estro poeticoarmonico (1724–26), a setting for voices and instruments of the first 50 psalms in an Italian paraphrase by G. Giustiniani. Il teatro alla moda is an amusing pamphlet in which Marcello vented his opinions on the state of musical drama at the time. The work was frequently reprinted and is an important document in the early history of opera.
Marcello was intended by his father for the law but turned to music instead. In 1711 he was a member of the Venetian Council of Forty and in 1730 went to Pola (Istria) as governor. After eight years he retired to Brescia as papal chamberlain. His compositions include operas, oratorios, cantatas, concerti, and sonatas. He was also a poet and translated John Dryden’s Timotheus as a text for one of his own cantatas and wrote a libretto for G. Ruggeri’s opera Arato in Sparta (1709).
The celebrated Concerto in D Minor for oboe and strings, long attributed to Benedetto, is now known to have been composed by his brother Alessandro (c. 1684–1750).
