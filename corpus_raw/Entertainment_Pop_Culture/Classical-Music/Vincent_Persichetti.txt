Vincent Persichetti,  (born June 6, 1915, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.â€”died  Aug. 14, 1987, Philadelphia), American composer noted for his succinct polyphonic style (based on interwoven melodic lines), forceful rhythms, and generally diatonic melodies (moving stepwise; not atonal or highly chromatic).
Persichetti began piano lessons at the age of 5, studied theory at 8, and produced his first two works at 14. Among his later teachers were the composer Roy Harris and the conductor Fritz Reiner, the latter at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. In 1942 Persichetti began teaching at the Philadelphia Conservatory, and from 1947 he taught at the Juilliard School in New York City. He also was music editor for the Elkan-Vogel Company in Philadelphia.
Among his many published works are several for band and various chamber combinations and the highly regarded Piano Quintet (1955). He also wrote nine symphonies and many piano concerti, as well as songs, solo sonatas (including one for harpsichord), ballet music, and a large group of serenades. Skilled in the composition of simple, elegant pieces as well as more complex and virtuosic works, Persichetti was credited with having produced a distinctive blend of Classical, Romantic, and Modernist elements.
He wrote the book Twentieth-Century Harmony: Creative Aspects and Practice (1961).
