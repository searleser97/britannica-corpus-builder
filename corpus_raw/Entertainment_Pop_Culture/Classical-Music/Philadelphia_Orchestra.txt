Philadelphia Orchestra,  American symphony orchestra based in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1900 under the direction of Fritz Sheel, who served until 1907. Subsequent conductors were Carl Pohlig (1907–12), Leopold Stokowski (1912–36), Eugene Ormandy (1936–80; director laureate until 1985), Riccardo Muti (1980–92), Wolfgang Sawallisch (1993–2003), and Christoph Eschenbach (2003–08). The orchestra subsequently was led by a chief conductor for several years before the young Canadian Yannick Nézet-Séguin was selected as the director-designate in 2010; he assumed full directorial duties in 2012.
From Stokowski’s tenure, the orchestra was renowned for its interpretation of the symphonic repertoire and for its interest in new music and musical technologies, as well as for its recordings, concert tours, and children’s concert programming. Stokowski led the orchestra in world premieres of Sergey Rachmaninoff’s Symphony No. 3 in A Minor and Fourth Piano Concerto and Arnold Schoenberg’s Violin Concerto. In 1939 he and the orchestra performed on the soundtrack of Walt Disney’s film Fantasia.
Under Ormandy, the Philadelphia Orchestra was known for its sonorous tone and its interpretation of the repertoire of French, German, and Russian music of the post-Romantic and early modern eras. Ormandy conducted world premieres of Béla Bartók’s Third Piano Concerto and Anton Webern’s Three Pieces for Orchestra. Muti commissioned works by contemporary composers, including Shulamit Ran, and appointed the orchestra’s first composer-in-residence, Bernard Rands. Muti also led concert performances of operas.
Since the 1930s the orchestra has given summer concerts, first at the Robin Hood Dell and, since 1976, at the Mann Music Center.
