Sir Geraint Evans,  (born February 16, 1922, Cilfynydd, Glamorganshire [now in Caerphilly], Wales—died September 19, 1992, Aberystwyth, Dyfed [now in Ceredigion]), Welsh opera singer, one of Britain’s leading operatic baritones, who was known for his interpretations of such roles as the title characters in Falstaff and The Marriage of Figaro, as well as Leporello in Don Giovanni and Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger.
Evans, the son of a coal miner, won a gold medal in a singing competition at age four. As a teenager he won a solo role on the Welsh Rarebit radio program. After service in the Royal Air Force in World War II, he was stationed in Hamburg, West Germany, and worked for the British Forces Radio Network, occasionally performing.
In 1948 Evans joined the opera company at London’s Covent Garden, making his debut in Die Meistersinger. The next season he made his debut as Figaro, a role he sang internationally, notably in his debuts at La Scala, Milan (1960), and the Salzburg (Austria) Festival (1961). He first appeared as Falstaff, his signature role, at the Glyndebourne (England) Festival in 1957 and made his debut at New York City’s Metropolitan Opera in that role in 1964. Other major roles were Bottom in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Balstrode in Peter Grimes, Papageno in The Magic Flute, and Dulcamara in L’Elisir d’amore, which he sang at his farewell performance at Covent Garden (1984). He was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (1959) and was knighted (1969). His autobiography, A Knight at the Opera, was published in 1984.
