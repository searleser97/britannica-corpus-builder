Annie Louise Cary, original name Ann Louisa Cary,  (born Oct. 22, 1841, Wayne, Maine, U.S.—died April 3, 1921, Norwalk, Conn.), opera singer whose rich dramatic voice, three-octave range, and command of the grand style made her the foremost American contralto for a decade in the late 19th century.
Cary graduated from Gorham Seminary in 1860, studied music and singing in Boston, and then in 1866 went to Europe for further training. After a year of study in Milan, Cary overcame her moral misgivings about opera and accepted an operatic engagement in Copenhagen, where she made her debut in January 1868 in Giuseppe Verdi’s Un ballo in maschera. In 1870 Cary made her London debut at Covent Garden in Gaetano Donizetti’s Lucrezia Borgiae. That year she was engaged by a company organized by the German-American impresarios Max and Maurice Strakosch and featuring Christine Nilsson. With that company Cary made a stunning New York City concert debut in 1870. She made her New York operatic debut in 1871. She was thereafter established as the preeminent contralto in both concert and opera on the American stage and perhaps in the world.
In November 1873 Cary sang Amneris in the American premiere of Aïda, and in an 1874 New York production of Lohengrin she became the first American woman to sing a Wagnerian role in the United States. She took part in the American premieres of Verdi’s Requiem in 1874, Johann Sebastian Bach’s Magnificat in 1875 and Christmas Oratorio in 1877, and Arrigo Boito’s Mefistofele in 1880. Her final operatic performance was in Un ballo in maschera in Philadelphia in 1881. After an appearance in May 1882 she retired from singing, marrying shortly thereafter.
