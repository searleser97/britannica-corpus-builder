Giovanni Battista Vitali,  (born Feb. 18, 1632, Bologna [Italy]—died  Oct. 12, 1692, Bologna), principal Italian composer of chamber music for strings in the period before Arcangelo Corelli. From about 1658 he played the cello in the church of S. Petronio in Bologna. In 1674 he was second and, in 1684, first, music director for Duke Francesco II of Modena. His published works consist principally of trio sonatas, in both the church and the secular styles, and a considerable quantity of dance music. A number of works are in manuscript in the Biblioteca Estense in Modena.
His son Tommaso Antonio Vitali (1663–1745) was in the service of the Este family at Modena. Among his chamber works are numerous trio sonatas.
