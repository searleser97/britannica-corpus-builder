Orchestre de Paris, formerly Paris Conservatory Orchestra,  French symphony orchestra formed in 1828 to perform at the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire. Its 56 string and 25 wind instrument players were present and former students of the Paris Conservatory, and its early concerts strongly emphasized Ludwig van Beethoven’s music. As its concerts continued to be successful in the 19th century, soloists such as Frédéric Chopin, Clara Schumann, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Felix Mendelssohn appeared with it.
In the 19th century the Société’s concerts inspired several concert series, most notably the Concerts Lamoureux. Under André Messager’s baton the Paris Conservatory Orchestra played the premieres of several important French works, including Claude Debussy’s opera Pélleas et Mélisande, and toured in 50 American cities. Its notable conductors included François-Antoine Habeneck (1828–49), Narcisse Girard (1849–60), Phillipe Gaubert (1918–38), Charles Munch (1938–46), and André Cluytens (1946–67).
Social strife in France led to the dissolution of the Paris Conservatory Orchestra in 1967 and to the formation of the Orchestre de Paris under the Société’s aegis later that year. Apart from its concern with French composers, the Orchestre de Paris is noted for performing works by modern composers, and in 1986 it began collaborating with Pierre Boulez’s Ensemble InterContemporain. The orchestra’s music directors were Munch (1967–68), Herbert von Karajan (1968–72), Serge Baudo (1969–71), Sir Georg Solti (1972–75), Daniel Barenboim (1975–89), Semyon Bychkov (1989–98), Christoph von Dohnányi (1998–99), Christoph Eschenbach (2000–10), and Paavo Järvi (2010–16). Daniel Harding became music director in 2016.
