Cleveland Orchestra (CO),  American symphony orchestra based in Cleveland, Ohio. It was founded by Adella Prentiss Hughes in 1918 and was one of the last major American orchestras to be created. Nikolai Sokoloff (1918–33), the first music director, was succeeded by Artur Rodzinski (1933–43), Erich Leinsdorf (1943–46, mostly in absentia; he was serving concurrently in the U.S. armed forces), George Szell (1946–70), Pierre Boulez (1970–72), Lorin Maazel (1972–82), Christoph von Dohnányi (1984–2002), and Franz Welser-Möst (2002– ).
Since 1930 the CO has recorded, performed live concerts broadcast over radio, and toured extensively throughout the United States. Under Szell’s directorship the CO achieved international recognition. In 1952 Szell instituted the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus, led by Robert Shaw, the CO’s associate conductor (1956–67). Since 1968, with the opening of Blossom Music Center, its summer performing site, the CO has maintained a year-round performing schedule. Under Dohnányi the CO became the most recorded orchestra, and one of the most distinguished, in the United States. The CO is known for its technique, ensemble playing, and lustrous tone, particularly in the central European repertoire of Haydn, Beethoven, Brahms, and Dvořák and in Wagnerian operas. The orchestra has toured extensively, performing in Europe and Asia.
