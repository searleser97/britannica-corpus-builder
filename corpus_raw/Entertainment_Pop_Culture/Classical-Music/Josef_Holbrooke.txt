Josef Holbrooke,  (born July 5, 1878, Croydon, Surreyâ€”died  August 5, 1958, London), composer whose works were popular in England in the early 20th century. His operas, of Wagnerian proportions, include the trilogy The Cauldron of Annwyn, based on Welsh legends: The Children of Don, 1912; Dylan, 1914; and Bronwen, 1929. Holbrooke was a prolific composer, but his works did not maintain themselves in the repertory.
