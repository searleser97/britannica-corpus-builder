Piano Concerto in A Minor, Op. 54,  three-movement concerto for piano by German composer Robert Schumann that premiered in Dresden on December 4, 1845. The work was written for—and premiered by—Clara Wieck Schumann, his wife, who was considered to be one of the great pianists of the day.
An early version of this piece, a one-movement fantasy, premiered during a rehearsal of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra on August 13, 1841, with Clara as soloist and their friend Felix Mendelssohn conducting the ensemble. Four years later Robert expanded the piece to a full-fledged concerto.
In the expansive first movement, “Allegro affettuoso,” based closely on the initial piano fantasy, a fiercely powerful opening theme is contrasted with a lyrical piano and clarinet duet, providing elegant contrast between the two divergent moods. The second movement, a sweet and songlike “Intermezzo,” resembles a scene of quiet domestic bliss. Without pause, the piece moves into the final movement, “Allegro vivace,” restating earlier themes and concluding with a vibrant finale.
