Antal Dorati,  (born April 9, 1906, Budapest, Hungary, Austria-Hungary [now in Hungary]—died November 13, 1988, Gerzensee, near Bern, Switzerland), Hungarian-born American conductor notable for his promotion of 20th-century music, particularly that of Béla Bartók.
The son of musicians, he entered at age 14 the Liszt Academy in Budapest, where he studied with Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, and Leo Weiner. He read philosophy at Vienna University and upon graduation became a private coach at the Budapest Royal Opera. His conducting debut took place there in 1924. In 1928 he became assistant conductor of the Dresden Opera and in 1929 became musical director at Münster Opera. From 1933 to 1941 he conducted and toured extensively with the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo.
After his American debut in 1937 with the National Symphony of Washington, D.C., Dorati developed a marked ability to build and reorganize orchestras. From 1941 to 1945 he was music director of the newly formed American Ballet Theater. He went on to conduct the Dallas Symphony Orchestra (1945–49), the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (1949–60), the BBC Symphony Orchestra (1963–66), the Stockholm Philharmonic (1966–70), the Washington National Symphony (1970–77), the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (1975–78), and the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (1977–81). He became an American citizen in 1947. Dorati’s many recordings include the complete Joseph Haydn symphonies (with the Philharmonia Hungarica). Throughout his career he broadened his orchestra’s repertoires, promoting modern music and commissioning new works. Notes of Seven Decades, his autobiography, was published in 1979.
