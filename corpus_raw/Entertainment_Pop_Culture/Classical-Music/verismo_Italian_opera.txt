Verismo, (Italian: “realism”)  a style of Italian opera writing that flourished in the last decade of the 19th century.
Based on the slightly earlier Italian literary verismo, which was itself influenced by French naturalism, operatic verismo was marked by melodramatic, often violent plots with characters drawn from everyday life. Musical devices included passionate declamation by solo voices and emotionally charged harmonies and melodies. The leading exponents were Pietro Mascagni (Cavalleria rusticana, 1890; Rustic Chivalry) and Ruggero Leoncavallo (Pagliacci, 1892; The Clowns). Another example is Umberto Giordano’s Andrea Chénier (1896). Giacomo Puccini was influenced by verismo, particularly in Tosca (1900), and occasional veristic operas were written in the 20th century—e.g., Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari’s I gioielli della Madonna (1911; The Jewels of the Madonna).
