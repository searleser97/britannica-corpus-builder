Sir William Sterndale Bennett,  (born April 13, 1816, Sheffield, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  Feb. 1, 1875, London), British pianist, composer, and conductor, a notable figure in the musical life of his time.
In 1826 Bennett became a chorister at King’s College, Cambridge, and also entered the Royal Academy of Music to study violin, piano, and composition. In 1833 his first piano concerto greatly impressed Felix Mendelssohn, who became a close friend. Perhaps as a consequence of the encouragement of people he admired, the next six years were Bennett’s most productive period as a composer and performer.
In the 1840s Bennett turned his attention to administration, conducting, and teaching. In 1842 he was appointed one of the directors of the Philharmonic Society in London, and in 1849 he founded the London Bach Society, at which, in 1854, he conducted the first performance in England of Johann Sebastian Bach’s St. Matthew Passion. Bennett was appointed conductor of the Philharmonic Society in 1855, and in 1856 he became professor of music at Cambridge. In 1866 he became principal of the Royal Academy of Music. He was knighted in 1871.
As a composer Bennett was indebted to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Mendelssohn, and he was praised for his devotion to an ideal of restrained music (as distinct from the virtuosic music of composers such as Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt). Bennett’s work, which consisted largely of orchestral works, piano concertos, and solo music for the piano, enjoyed wide popularity in England and Germany. His concert overtures included charming Mendelssohnian works such as Parisina and The Naiades. Bennett’s cantata The May Queen was popular during his lifetime, but its dated text limited its appeal to later audiences. His piano music was still occasionally performed and recorded in the early 21st century.
