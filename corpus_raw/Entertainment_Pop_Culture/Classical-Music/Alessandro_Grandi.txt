Alessandro Grandi,  (died 1630, Bergamo, Republic of Venice [Italy]), Italian composer noted for his solo songs; he was the first to use the word cantata in the modern sense.
Grandi was musical director to a religious fraternity in Ferrara in 1597 and held other positions there until 1617, when he became a singer at St. Mark’s in Venice. In 1620 he became Claudio Monteverdi’s assistant there. During this period he produced several remarkably fine books of songs called Cantade et arie a voce sola (published 1620–29). He combined a gift for attractive melody with one for finding music to fit exactly the meaning of the words. His monodic “cantatas” are precursors of the ground-bass songs of Henry Purcell, the voice varying the melody over a repeated bass. He also wrote religious songs in the same style, and these had some influence on Heinrich Schütz. In 1627 he went to Bergamo to become music director at the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. He died with his family during a plague epidemic.
