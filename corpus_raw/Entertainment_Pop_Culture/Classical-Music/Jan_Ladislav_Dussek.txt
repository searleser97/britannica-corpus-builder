Jan Ladislav Dussek, Dussek also spelled Dušek or Dusik,  (born Feb. 12, 1760, Čáslav, Bohemia [now in Czech Republic]—died March 20, 1812, St. Germain-en-Laye, France), Bohemian pianist and composer, best known for his piano and chamber music.
The son of a cathedral organist, Dussek studied music with his father and showed great skill as a pianist and organist at an early age. He sang in the choir at Iglau (Jihlava) and later studied theology at Prague. After working as an organist, in about 1779 or 1780 he began to perform as a virtuoso pianist, most notably in the Netherlands, where he attained a great reputation and wrote a large number of “accompanied sonatas” for pianoforte and strings. In Hamburg in 1782 he studied under C.P.E. Bach. He subsequently toured as a pianist, performing in St. Petersburg, Berlin, Paris, and Italy. He made a successful debut in 1789 in London, where he established a music shop and gave many concerts, prompting the visiting Joseph Haydn to write about him in glowing terms. When his business failed in 1799 Dussek fled from England to escape his creditors (his wife and her family were not so fortunate). He subsequently stayed in Hamburg and Berlin (as kapellmeister), appeared in concerts in Čáslav and Prague, and lived in the household of Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand in Paris from about 1807 until his death.
As a pianist Dussek possessed great dexterity and could elicit a singing tone that was much praised by his contemporaries. He is said to have been the first pianist to place his piano sideways on the platform, so that the public could see a profile view of the performer (an innovation often credited to Franz Liszt). Dussek’s own musical compositions include a considerable number of pianoforte sonatas and concerti and numerous chamber works for piano and strings. His piano sonatas represent him at his best, and, though his works are largely forgotten, he influenced the growth of piano technique, both as pianist and as composer.
