Bernard Haitink,  (born March 4, 1929, Amsterdam, Netherlands), Dutch conductor best known for his interpretations of Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Franz Liszt. His conducting, which continued the tradition of Willem Mengelberg, was noted for its careful attention to detail combined with an uncommon strength of character and conviction.
After studying at the Amsterdam Conservatory, Haitink joined the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic as a violinist. He studied conducting with Ferdinand Leitner at the Netherlands Radio Union’s annual conductor’s courses, 1954–55, and became their second conductor in 1955. His association with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam began in 1956, and he was appointed its coconductor in 1961 and permanent conductor in 1964. He also served as artistic adviser (from 1967) and artistic director (1970–79) of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1972 Haitink turned his attention to opera, which led to his appointment in 1978 as music director of the Glyndebourne Festival in East Sussex, England. He became music director of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London in 1986, and he held that post until 2002. In 2002–04 he was principal guest conductor of the Staatskapelle Dresden, and in 2006–10 he led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra as principal conductor. Haitink’s many recordings included cycles of the symphonies of Mahler, Bruckner, and Beethoven and the tone poems of Liszt. He retired in 2019, after having conducted his final concert at the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland.
