Lilli Lehmann,  (born November 24, 1848, Würzburg, Bavaria [Germany]—died May 17, 1929, Berlin), German operatic soprano and lieder singer, known especially for her performances as Isolde in Richard Wagner’s opera Tristan und Isolde.
Lehmann made her debut in Prague in 1865 as the First Boy in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute). In 1870 she joined the Berlin Opera and was a coloratura singer in such roles as the Queen of the Night in Die Zauberflöte. She was coached by Wagner in the parts of one of the Rhinemaidens and the Forest Bird for the first Bayreuth performances of his cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. She later undertook dramatic soprano roles and became the greatest Isolde of her day. She was equally outstanding in Ludwig van Beethoven’s Fidelio. In 1885–89 and 1891–92 she sang at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.
Lehmann was admired for her dramatic presence and fine voice and for her versatility: her repertory encompassed 170 operatic roles, from Wagner to Vincenzo Bellini to Jacques Offenbach, and 600 lieder. She gave memorable lieder recitals and was active from 1905 in the organization of the Salzburg Festivals. She wrote an autobiography, Mein Weg (1913; My Path Through Life), and Meine Gesangskunst (1902; How to Sing).
