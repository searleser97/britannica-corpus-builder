Peter Philips,  (born 1560/61, London?, England—died 1628, Brussels, Spanish Netherlands [now in Belgium]), English composer of madrigals, motets, and keyboard music of considerable reputation in his lifetime.
Philips was a Roman Catholic, and in 1582 he left England for Italy, where he became organist of the English College in Rome. In 1585 he entered the service of Lord Thomas Paget, with whom he traveled extensively. After Paget’s death in 1590, Philips went to Antwerp, then part of the Spanish Netherlands. In 1593 he was accused by the Dutch authorities of planning the murder of Queen Elizabeth I of England, but after imprisonment and trial he was released. In 1597 he moved to Brussels, where he became organist of the royal chapel of Archduke Albert of Austria. Sometime during this period, Philips probably took holy orders, for in 1610 he was appointed to a canonry.
Volumes of Philips’s madrigals, to Italian texts, were published in 1596, 1598, and 1603. Eight volumes of his church music were issued between 1612 and 1633, but a posthumously published volume of masses has since been lost. Many of his compositions appeared in contemporary collections, including Thomas Morley’s First Book of Consort Lessons (1599) and the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, which contains 19 of his keyboard pieces. An examination of Philips’s style reveals Italian and Dutch as well as English influences.
