Alberto Ginastera, in full Alberto Evaristo Ginastera,  (born April 11, 1916, Buenos Aires, Arg.—died  June 25, 1983, Geneva, Switz.), a leading 20th-century Latin-American composer, known for his use of local and national musical idioms in his compositions.
Ginastera was musically talented as a child and studied in Buenos Aires at the Conservatorio Williams and the National Conservatory. He received a Guggenheim award and lived in the United States in 1946–47.
Ginastera’s music marks him as a traditionalist, despite his advanced musical vocabulary, which owes much to the great musical figures of the early 20th century. His synthesis of techniques is unique and eclectic, and he makes use of microtones (smaller than half tones), serial procedures (basing works on selected series of pitches, rhythms, etc.), and aleatory, or chance, music as well as older established forms. Ginastera’s Piano Concerto and Cantata para América mágica won great acclaim at the 1961 Interamerican Music Festival. His first opera, Don Rodrigo (1964), unsuccessful in its premiere in Buenos Aires, was hailed as a triumph in New York City in 1966.
Ginastera’s masterpiece is the chamber opera Bomarzo (1967), which established him as one of the leading opera composers of the 20th century. This highly dissonant score is a reworking of a cantata of the same name for narrator, male voice, and chamber orchestra, commissioned by the E.S. Coolidge Foundation at the Library of Congress (1964). In Bomarzo Ginastera made use of novel and complex compositional techniques but preserved the traditional opera format of arias and recitatives in its 15 scenes. He further developed this style in his final opera, Beatrix Cenci, which had its debut in 1971 in Washington, D.C.
