Sir Adrian Cedric Boult,  (born April 8, 1889, Chester, Cheshire, England—died February 23, 1983, Kent), English conductor who led the BBC Symphony and other major orchestras during a career that spanned six decades.
He received his first musical training at Christ Church, Oxford, and continued his studies at the Leipzig Conservatory, where he was influenced by the fluid technique and minimal rehearsal habits of the Hungarian conductor Arthur Nikisch. Boult returned home in 1913 to join the staff of the Covent Garden Opera. In 1919 he was given a season at the Royal Philharmonic. A year later he began a decade of service on the faculty of the Royal College of Music. In 1919 he conducted with Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes during its London sojourn. In 1923 he was engaged by the City of Birmingham Orchestra. He conducted there until 1930, at which time he was hired to train and conduct the BBC Orchestra and act as the corporation’s musical director. During his 20 years with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, he developed it into a major international orchestra. From 1950 to 1957 he was principal conductor of the London Philharmonic. A nominal retirement followed, marked by another season (1959–60) at Birmingham and numerous guest appearances until he retired in 1981.
Boult’s conducting style was economic, with little use of the left hand. Throughout his career he promoted works by modern English composers, including William Walton, Malcolm Arnold, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Boult was knighted in 1937. He was featured in a film about his conducting style, Point of the Stick (1971).
