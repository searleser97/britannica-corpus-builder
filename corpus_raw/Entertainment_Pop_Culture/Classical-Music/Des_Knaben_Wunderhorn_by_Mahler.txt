Des Knaben Wunderhorn, (German: “The Boy’s [or Youth’s] Magic Horn”)  song cycle by Austrian composer Gustav Mahler, composed mostly in the 1890s for solo vocalist with orchestra accompaniment. The words derive from folk roots, but the music is entirely Mahler’s.
Years before the Brothers Grimm began to publish the stories they collected, another equally ambitious effort, Des Knaben Wunderhorn (1805–08), had appeared. This three-volume compilation of folk songs, poems, and aphorisms was the work of two young writers, Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim, who viewed their collection as a tribute to German culture.
Brentano and Arnim were not alone in their high regard for the collection; no less a giant than Goethe believed that all intelligent people should possess a copy, and the poet Heinrich Heine wrote that “anyone who wishes to come to know the German people in its most lovable aspect should study these folk songs.” Although many German writers were moved to study the collection, composers were musically uninterested until late in the 19th century, when Mahler began to draw upon Wunderhorn for melodic inspiration.
More than half of the songs that Mahler composed in the course of his career are settings of lyrics from Wunderhorn. Of his two dozen settings of Wunderhorn texts, 12 were published together in that specific song cycle. In those songs, Mahler covered a vast range of subjects and emotions. Wistful romances are juxtaposed with tragic tales of starving children. St. Anthony preaches valiantly to impervious schools of fish, and in another song an avian vocal contest judged by a donkey conceals a satirical parable of musical tastes. Martial imagery abounds in this ambitious cycle. Several songs concern the harsh lives and harsher deaths of soldiers. Mahler later used melodies he had written for the collection in orchestral compositions, notably his second, third, and fourth symphonies.
