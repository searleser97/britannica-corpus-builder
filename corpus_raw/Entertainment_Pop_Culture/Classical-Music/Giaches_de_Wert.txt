Giaches de Wert, also spelled Jaches de Vuert,  (born 1535, Ghent?, Flanders [Belgium]—died May 6, 1596, Mantua [Italy]), Flemish composer best known to his contemporaries for his madrigals. He was highly praised by contemporary musicians, particularly Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Thomas Morley, and Claudio Monteverdi.
It is likely that de Wert was taken to Italy as a boy to be a singer in an aristocratic household based near Naples. About 1550 he is believed to have moved to Novellara (now in Emilia-Romagna, Italy), where he became attached to a court of the Gonzaga family. This connection may have led to his work for a few years in the early 1560s as maestro di cappella (choirmaster) at the governor’s court in Milan. In 1565 he was appointed maestro di cappella to Guglielmo Gonzaga, the duke of Mantua, at the ducal chapel of Santa Barbara. He held this position until 1592, by which time his health had begun to fail.
De Wert was a prolific composer, producing a large number of both sacred and secular works of various types. Because much of his sacred music was written for the exclusive use of Santa Barbara, all but one of his seven masses and his more than 125 hymns were published after his death. Of his sacred music, only his three collections of motets were published during his lifetime. As a result, de Wert is especially recognized for his madrigals, canzonets, motets, and other occasional vocal pieces. Modern scholars have noted his influence on other composers, notably on Claudio Monteverdi, whose years at Mantua overlapped with de Wert’s later tenure.
