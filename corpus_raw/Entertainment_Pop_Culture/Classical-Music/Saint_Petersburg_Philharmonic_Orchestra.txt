Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, formerly Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra,  symphony orchestra based in St. Petersburg. The Philharmonic Society was founded there in 1802, and its orchestra included musicians from eastern Europe as well as from Russia.
After the Russian Revolution of February 1917, the society’s orchestra became the State Orchestra and was merged with the new Petrograd Philharmonic; the resultant State Philharmonic Orchestra of Petrograd won wide acclaim in the 1920s and 1930s. In the early 1920s it was renamed the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. During World War II the orchestra relocated to Novosibirsk, where it gave 538 concerts in three years, despite losing musicians and much of its musical library. In postwar years it suffered a period of decline, and some of its musicians defected from the Soviet Union during its tours of Western countries. The orchestra changed its name to the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra in 1991.
St. Petersburg was the centre of 18th- and 19th-century Russian music, and it was the home of Michael Glinka, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, and Aleksandr Borodin, all of whose music became part of the orchestra’s repertoire. In the 20th century the orchestra played premieres of works by St. Petersburg native Dmitry Shostakovich. Among the most notable musical directors of the orchestra have been Serge Koussevitzky (1917–20) and Evgeny Mravinsky (1938–88). In 1988 Yuri Temirkanov became the orchestra’s artistic director and chief conductor.
