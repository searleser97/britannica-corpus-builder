Pauline Viardot, in full Michelle Ferdinande Pauline Viardot, née García,  (born July 18, 1821, Paris, France—died May 18, 1910, Paris), French mezzo-soprano, best known for highly dramatic operatic roles.
As a child Viardot studied piano with Franz Liszt, composition with Anton Reicha, and voice with her mother. She was the sister of Maria Malibran, the celebrated soprano, and of the great voice teacher Manuel García II. Viardot made her concert debut at the age of 15 in Brussels and her operatic debut two years later as Desdemona in Gioachino Rossini’s Otello in London. She was noted for her wide vocal range and could sing both soprano and contralto roles. Her greatest successes were in highly dramatic roles, such as Fidès in Giacomo Meyerbeer’s Le prophète (1849), which was written for her, and Rachel in Fromental Halévy’s La Juive. The climax of her career came in 1859 when she performed the title role in Hector Louis Berlioz’ re-creation of Christoph Gluck’s Orfeo ed Eurydice at the Théâtre Lyrique in Paris. She sang for several seasons in the opera in St. Petersburg, Russia, and was one of the first artists to promote Russian music in western Europe. Her thoughtful interpretations earned her a place in Parisian intellectual circles, and Johannes Brahms, Camille Saint-Saëns, Robert Schumann, and Gabriel Fauré all wrote pieces for her. In her later years she taught singing and composed. Her compositions include vocal transcriptions of Frédéric Chopin’s mazurkas, songs setting Russian texts, and several operettas, including Le dernier sorcier (1869; “The Last Sorcerer”), the libretto of which was written by the Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev, who had fallen in love with Viardot when she first performed in Russia in 1843.
