Razumovsky Quartets, byname of String Quartets, Op. 59, Nos. 7–9,  three string quartets by Ludwig van Beethoven composed in 1805–06 for the Russian ambassador to Vienna, Count Andreas Razumovsky. They premiered in Vienna in February 1807 and were published as a set the following year.
The Razumovsky Quartets reflect a sharp departure from Beethoven’s earlier chamber music, which had been written in a simple style with Vienna’s many amateur ensembles in mind. The Razumovsky Quartets are richer and more varied, with intricate layering of parts and ambitious development of themes, but they also place heavy technical demands on the players. There are jolting emotional shifts, often matched by radical stylistic juxtapositions such as the balancing of a cerebral fugue theme against the verve of a Russian country dance.
The quartets’ reception was largely negative. The violinist Ignaz Schuppanzigh, who had performed many of Beethoven’s chamber works, insisted that they were too unusual and challenging and predicted that few violinists would be able to play them.
