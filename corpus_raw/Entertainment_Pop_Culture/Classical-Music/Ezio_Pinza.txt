Ezio Pinza, in full Ezio Fortunato Pinza,  (born May 18, 1892, Rome, Italy—died  May 9, 1957, Stamford, Conn., U.S.), Italian-born operatic bass and actor.
Pinza studied civil engineering before turning, at his father’s urging, to singing. At 18 he sang Oroveso in Vincenzo Bellini’s Norma at Cremona. His vocal studies at the Conservatory of Bologna were interrupted by army service during World War I. He made his Rome debut in 1920 as King Mark in Richard Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde. He then sang for three years at La Scala in Milan, where in 1924 he sang Tigellino in the premiere of Arrigo Boito’s Nerone. In 1926 he made his New York City debut at the Metropolitan as Pontifex Maximus in Gaspare Spontini’s La vestale, and for the next 22 years he was that company’s leading bass. He was admired for his commanding presence and sonorous voice and appeared in such varied roles as Boris Godunov, Figaro, and Don Giovanni.
In 1949, at the peak of his operatic fame, Pinza left the Metropolitan to star in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway musical South Pacific; his success launched a new career for him in musical comedy, motion pictures, radio, and television. His recordings were also enormously popular.
