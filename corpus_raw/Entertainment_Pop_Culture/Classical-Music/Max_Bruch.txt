Max Bruch, in full Max Karl August Bruch,  (born January 6, 1838, Cologne, Prussia [Germany]—died  October 2, 1920, Friedenau [now in Berlin], Germany), German composer remembered chiefly for his virtuoso violin concerti.
Bruch wrote a symphony at age 14 and won a scholarship enabling him to study at Cologne. His first opera, Scherz, List und Rache (Jest, Deceit, and Revenge, text adapted from a work by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe), was performed in 1858. He conducted orchestral and choral societies at Koblenz (1865), Sondershausen (1867), Berlin (1878), Liverpool (1880–83), and Breslau (1883–90; now Wrocław, Poland). From 1890 to 1911 he was a professor at the Berlin Academy of Arts.
Bruch was an unusually ambitious and productive composer. His greatest successes in his own lifetime were his massive works for choir and orchestra—such as Schön Ellen (1867; Beautiful Ellen) and Odysseus (1872). These were favourites with German choral societies during the late 19th century. These works failed to remain in the concert repertoire, possibly because, despite his sound workmanship and effective choral writing, he lacked the depth of conception and originality needed to sustain large works. Bruch’s few works that remain on concert programs are the Scottish Fantasy for violin and orchestra (1880), the Kol Nidrei for cello and orchestra (1881), and virtuoso pieces for the violin and for the cello, notably his three violin concerti. His brilliant Violin Concerto No. 1 in G Minor (1868) has won a permanent place in the violin repertoire.
