Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, German Berliner Philharmonisches Orchester, also called Berliner Philharmoniker,  German symphony orchestra, based in Berlin and internationally acclaimed for its artistry. It is descended from Bilsesche Kapelle (“Bilse’s Band”), formed in 1862 and directed by Benjamin Bilse, the court music director. In 1882, 54 of its then 70 members left Bilse’s Band to form a new ensemble. The Berlin Philharmonic’s history as a major world orchestra began when noted pianist-conductor Hans von Bülow was its principal conductor (1887–92).
Subsequent music directors have included Arthur Nikisch (1895–1922), under whom the orchestra toured internationally, and Wilhelm Furtwängler (1922–45; 1952–54), who acquired a municipal subsidy for the orchestra. Its concert hall, the Philharmonie, was destroyed by bombing during World War II; the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra nonetheless continued to perform, under various conductors until Furtwängler became sole director in 1952–54. He was succeeded by Herbert von Karajan (1955–89), one of the preeminent conductors of the 20th century, Claudio Abbado (1989–2002), and Simon Rattle (2002–18). Kirill Petrenko replaced Rattle in 2019.
Since the 1920s the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has been renowned for its performances of Classical, Romantic, and early 20th-century music. The orchestra is a self-governing organization noted for its extensive repertoire, its many international tours, and its voluminous recordings. A number of chamber music groups have been formed from the orchestra’s membership, including string ensembles, wind ensembles, and mixed instrumental groups.
