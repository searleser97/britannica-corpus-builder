Francesco Landini,  Landini also spelled Landino,  (born c. 1335, Fiesole, near Florence—died  Sept. 2, 1397, Florence), leading composer of 14th-century Italy, famed during his lifetime for his musical memory, his skill in improvisation, and his virtuosity on the organetto, or portative organ, as well as for his compositions. He also played the flute and the rebec.
The son of Jacopo the Painter, Landini was blinded in childhood by smallpox. He attained in his youth a reputation for learning in philosophy, astrology, and music, and he was crowned with a laurel wreath as the winner of a poetical contest at Venice in 1364. In Il Paradiso degli Alberti del 1389, Giovanni da Prato described Landini as playing his songs so sweetly “that no one had ever heard such beautiful harmonies, and their hearts almost burst from their bosoms.”
Landini’s surviving works include numerous songs, of which his favourite form was the ballata, an Italian song form modeled on the French virelay or on the native Italian lauda spirituale. The melodies (top part predominating) are vocal in character and highly ornamental. As in other songs of the period, they are distinguished by elaborate patterning, syncopations, roulades, and an evident lack of emotional connection between the words and the music. The songs were performed by voices, instruments, or, typically, a mixture of both. Their stylized elegance, gay preciosity, and clear, limpid texture characterize all of Landini’s songs.
In addition to his 140 settings of ballate (91 for two voices, 49 for three), his surviving compositions include 12 madrigals, a virelay, and a caccia.
One distinctive cadence formula that was common in 14th-century music, particularly that of Landini, is known as the Landini cadence, in which the leading tone drops to the sixth of the scale before approaching the final tonic note.
