Alan Hovhaness, Hovhaness also spelled Hovaness, original name Alan Vaness Chakmakjian,  (born March 8, 1911, Somerville, Massachusetts, U.S.—died June 21, 2000, Seattle, Washington), American composer of Armenian and Scottish descent, notable for his eclectic choice of material from non-European traditions.
Hovhaness studied composition with Frederic Converse at the New England Conservatory from 1932 to 1934 and in 1942 at the Berkshire Music Center in Tanglewood, Massachusetts, with Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein, and Bohuslav Martinů. He taught at the Boston Conservatory (1948–51) and traveled and composed extensively. By age 30 he had grown interested in Armenian music, and he later broadened his focus to include music of the Middle East and Asia. In 1959, during a trip to India and Japan, he studied with local musicians and performed and conducted his own works. In 1965 Hovhaness started his own record label (Poseidon Records), which was meant primarily for recording his own works and which he maintained for more than 15 years. In 1966 he became composer in residence with the Seattle Symphony.
Hovhaness’s compositions drew on many exotic rhythmic, melodic, and instrumental resources, as his descriptive titles indicate. His style is often modal and rhythmically intricate, but it is lyrically expressive and de-emphasizes harmony. His Symphony No. 16 for strings and Korean percussion (first performed 1963) shows his use of unusual instrumental groupings, as does his Sextet for violin, timpani, drums, tam-tam, marimba, and glockenspiel (1966).
Hovhaness’s early work is mostly lost, because he supposedly destroyed about 1,000 pieces in 1940. His compositions after that period fall into several categories. His stage works include several chamber operas, including Blue Flame (1959) and Pilate (1963); the score to the Broadway production of The Flowering Peach (1954; lyrics by Clifford Odets); and music for modern dance. Large works for soloists, chorus, and orchestra include the Magnificat (1959), Lady of Light (1969), and The Way of Jesus (1974). His instrumental works range from keyboard and chamber music (Allegro on a Pakistan Lute Tune for piano, 1952; and Duet for violin and harpsichord, 1954) to more than two dozen symphonies and many other orchestral compositions.
