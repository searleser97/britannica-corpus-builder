Norman Dello Joio,  (born Jan. 24, 1913, New York, N.Y., U.S.â€”died July 24, 2008, East Hampton, N.Y.), American composer in the neoclassical style who is particularly noted for his choral music.
A member of a musical family, Dello Joio studied organ under his father. He attended the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard Graduate School and later studied composition with Paul Hindemith. As a neoclassical composer he frequently combined old forms (such as the ricercar, variation, sonata, and chaconne) with contemporary musical techniques. His music, harmonically conservative, has melodic appeal and rhythmic liveliness. He is particularly noted for his choral music.
In 1957 Dello Joio received the Pulitzer Prize in music for Meditation on Ecclesiastes, for string orchestra. His other compositions include the operas The Trial at Rouen (1955; rev. 1959 and retitled The Triumph of St. Joan) and Blood Moon (1961); A Psalm of David for mixed chorus (1950); Antiphonal Fantasy on a Theme by Vincenzo Albrici for organ, brass, and strings (1965); Evocations for chorus and orchestra (1970); Mass in Honor of Pope John XXIII for organ, brass, strings, and chorus (1975); As of a Dream for orchestra, soloists, chorus, narrator, and dancers (1978); Hymns Without Words for chorus and piano (1979); East Hampton Sketches for strings (1983); as well as chamber music and several ballets. From 1972 to 1978 he served on the faculty of Boston University.
