Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major, K 331,  three-movement sonata for solo piano by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, written 1781–83. It is best known for its third movement, written “in the Turkish style,” which is often heard in transcriptions for instruments other than the piano.
Mozart composed about 20 solo piano sonatas, from roughly 1775 through the summer of 1789. Midway through that sequence is the Sonata in A, K 331. (The “K” refers to Ludwig, Ritter [knight] von Köchel, a 19th-century Austrian musicologist who compiled the most complete chronological catalog of Mozart’s works.) This sonata was one of three collectively published in 1784 as Opus 6, though in fact Mozart had written more than 300 compositions by that time. Concerned about losing proceeds by making his works available to other performers, he had withheld most of his music from publication.
The sonata’s first movement, “Andante grazioso,” is a theme and six variations. The second, “Menuetto,” is a minuet and trio. The term trio refers to the contrasting melody that appears between two statements of the first “minuet” melody. In the final movement, “Alla turca: allegretto,” Mozart provided music in the Turkish style, a popular trend in Vienna. The sound imitated was that of the percussive Janissary music of the Turkish military bands.
