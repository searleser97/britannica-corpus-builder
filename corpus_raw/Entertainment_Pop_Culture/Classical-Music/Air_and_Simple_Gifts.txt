Air and Simple Gifts,  chamber work for violin, cello, piano, and clarinet by John Williams that premiered in Washington, D.C., on January 20, 2009, at the presidential inauguration of Barack Obama. It is one of relatively few works of chamber music by this composer, who is noted for his film music (Jaws [1975], Raiders of the Lost Ark [1981], E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial [1982], and many others).
No classical composition has likely been heard by a greater audience at its premiere performance than Williams’s Air and Simple Gifts. Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, Anthony McGill, and Gabriela Montero performed outdoors, on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, before hundreds of thousands of spectators, with many millions more following via television and other media. (Cold temperatures necessitated the use of a recording to which the performers synchronized their movements.)
Williams’s score made use of the traditional American hymn tune “Simple Gifts,” which appears prominently in Aaron Copland’s Appalachian Spring. After a brief lyrical introduction largely for the strings, the main theme is stated and each of the players is featured in a sequence of variations.
