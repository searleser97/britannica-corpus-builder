John Knowles Paine,  (born Jan. 9, 1839, Portland, Maine, U.S.—died  April 25, 1906, Cambridge, Mass.), composer and organist, the first American to win wide recognition as a composer and the first professor of music at an American university.
After a thorough musical grounding in Portland, Paine completed his studies in Berlin (1858–61). In 1861 he initiated a series of organ recitals and lectures in Boston that led to his appointment in 1862 as instructor (later professor) of music at Harvard University. The music department he organized there became a model for those of many other American universities.
Both as a teacher and as a composer he was a major influence on the development of music in the United States. His works, generally modeled on the German classics, include two symphonies, a Mass in D (1866–67), and the oratorio St. Peter (1872).
