Friedrich von Flotow,  (born April 26, 1812, Teutendorf, near Lübeck, French Empire [now in Germany]—died  Jan. 24, 1883, Darmstadt, Ger.), German composer, active mainly in France, who was best known for his opera Martha (1847).
Originally intended for a diplomatic career, from age 16 Flotow studied music in Paris with Anton Reicha. Forced to leave Paris during the July Revolution of 1830, he went home but returned to Paris in 1831. In 1837 he produced a first, brief version of the opera Alessandro Stradella, which later, in its complete form, enjoyed great success. In 1839 he collaborated with Albert Grisar and Auguste Pilati on Le Naufrage de la Méduse (“The Wreck of the Medusa”). Between 1840 and 1878 he produced 19 light operas. Martha, composed to a German libretto and first performed in Vienna, was subsequently heard in translation in many European cities. One of its numbers, in the English version, is “The Last Rose of Summer.” Appealing in its melodic charm, Martha won a lasting place in the operatic repertory. Flotow also wrote ballets for the court theatre at Schwerin, of which he was director from 1855 to 1862, and incidental music for William Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale.
