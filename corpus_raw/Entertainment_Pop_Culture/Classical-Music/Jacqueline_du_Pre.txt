Jacqueline du Pré,  (born January 26, 1945, Oxford, England—died October 19, 1987, London), British cellist whose romantic, emotive style propelled her to international stardom by age 20. Although du Pré’s playing career was cut short by illness, she is regarded as one of the 20th century’s greatest cellists.
Du Pré began studying cello at age five. Along with her sister Hilary, she received her early musical training from her mother, Iris, a professional pianist and music teacher. She subsequently studied with the cellist William Pleeth at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and, later, with such prominent cellists as Paul Tortelier, Pablo Casals, and Mstislav Rostropovich. Her debut solo recital was at Wigmore Hall in London in 1961.
In 1965 she recorded Elgar’s Cello Concerto in E Minor, Op. 85, with the London Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Sir John Barbirolli. Du Pré’s interpretation was hailed as definitive, and the mournful piece came to be her signature. In 1967 she married the Israeli pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim, another young virtuoso, and the couple toured the world, often performing with the Israeli violinist Pinchas Zukerman.
In 1970 du Pré began to experience episodes of weakness and loss of sensation in her limbs, accompanied by fatigue and depression. Believing that her symptoms were rooted in psychological stress, doctors recommended a sabbatical. Du Pré returned to performing in 1973, but her technique had become inconsistent, resulting in the first negative reviews of her career. The true cause of her symptoms remained unidentified until October 1973, when she was finally diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The diagnosis ended her playing career, although she continued to teach when her health permitted it.
