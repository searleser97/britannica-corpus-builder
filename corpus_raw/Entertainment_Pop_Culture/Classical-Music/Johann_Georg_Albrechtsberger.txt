Johann Georg Albrechtsberger,  (born February 3, 1736, Klosterneuburg, near Vienna, Austrian Habsburg domain [now in Austria]—died March 7, 1809, Vienna), Austrian composer, organist, and music theorist who was one of the most learned and skillful contrapuntists of his time. His fame attracted many pupils, including Ludwig van Beethoven.
Albrechtsberger studied organ and thorough bass with Leopold Pittner and from 1755 to 1766 held various posts as organist. In 1772 he was appointed deputy court organist in Vienna, succeeded Mozart as an assistant Kapellmeister at St. Stephen’s Cathedral after the latter’s death in 1791, and became full Kapellmeister in 1793. One of the finest organists of his day, he was also an influential teacher who trained a generation of Viennese musicians, including Beethoven, Carl Czerny, and Johann Nepomuk Hummel.
Of Albrechtsberger’s more than 750 compositions, most remain in manuscript. They include 35 masses, 240 fugues for various instruments, many string quartets and two-movement sonatas, and other religious and chamber music. His main theoretical work, Gründliche Anweisung zur Composition (1790; “Fundamentals of Composition”), was based mainly on earlier works by Johann Joseph Fux and Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg. His understanding of Baroque polyphony and counterpoint enriched the developing Viennese Classicism of his own day.
