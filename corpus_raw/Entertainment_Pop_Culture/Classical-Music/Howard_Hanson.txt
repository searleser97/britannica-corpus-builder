Howard Hanson,  (born Oct. 28, 1896, Wahoo, Neb., U.S.—died  Feb. 26, 1981, Rochester, N.Y.), composer, conductor, and teacher who promoted contemporary American music and was, in his own compositions, a principal representative of the Romantic tradition.
After studying in New York, Hanson taught in San Jose, Calif., and spent three years in Italy (1921–24) as winner of the American Prix de Rome. On his return to the United States he became director of the newly organized Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., a post he held until his retirement in 1964. He established annual festivals of American music and conducted more than 1,000 new works by young composers, many of them his own pupils. In 1958 he organized the Eastman Philharmonia, a student orchestra with which he toured Europe, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East in 1961–62.
Hanson refers to his Swedish ancestry in his Symphony No. 1 (1923; Nordic). His Symphony No. 2 (1930; Romantic), commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra on its 50th anniversary, proclaimed his faith in Romanticism. His Symphony No. 4 (1943; Requiem), dedicated to the memory of his father, won a Pulitzer Prize. Among his other works are the Symphony No. 5 (1955; Sinfonia Sacra); the Lux Aeterna for orchestra (1923); Songs from Drum Tap for voices and orchestra (1935; after Walt Whitman); an opera, Merry Mount (1934), commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera; and chamber music. He also published a textbook for advanced students, Harmonic Materials of Modern Music (1960). Hanson’s style belongs to the mid-20th century. His harmonies, although complex, are sonorous; his rhythms are strong and varied, and his orchestration is effective. Although he was influenced by Jean Sibelius and Modest Mussorgsky, his style is individual.
