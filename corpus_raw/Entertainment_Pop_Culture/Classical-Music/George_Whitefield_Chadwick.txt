George Whitefield Chadwick,   (born Nov. 13, 1854, Lowell, Mass., U.S.—died  April 4, 1931, Boston), composer of the so-called New England group, whose music is rooted in the traditions of European Romanticism.
Chadwick studied organ and music theory in Boston and in 1877 went to Germany to study with Karl Reinecke, Salomon Jadassohn, and Josef Rheinberger. Returning to the United States in 1880, he was engaged as instructor in music theory at the New England Conservatory in Boston; in 1897 he became its director and held this post until his death. As an educator he played an important role in American music; among his pupils were the composers Horatio Parker, Henry Hadley, and Frederick Converse. He also conducted orchestral and choral concerts.
Chadwick was a firm believer in the representational meaning of music; most of his orchestral works bear programmatic titles. In his harmonic writing he followed the procedures of his German teachers, with some distinctive additions of French and American popular elements.
The list of Chadwick’s works is considerable and includes three symphonies (1882, 1885, 1894), five concert overtures, three symphonic poems, two cantatas, a burlesque opera (Tabasco, 1894), a lyric drama (Judith, 1901), numerous choruses, five string quartets, a piano quintet (1888), and many songs and organ pieces. Chadwick also published a textbook, Harmony (1897).
