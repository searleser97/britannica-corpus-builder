Adolphe Nourrit,  (born March 3, 1802, Montpellier, France—died  March 8, 1839, Naples [Italy]), French dramatic tenor who created many new roles in French opera.
His father, Louis Nourrit, was both a leading tenor at the Paris Opéra and a diamond merchant. Adolphe studied voice with Manuel García, a famous tenor of the time, and at 19 years of age he made his successful debut at the Paris Opéra as Pylades in Christoph Willibald Gluck’s Iphigénie en Tauride. Within five years he succeeded his father as the leading tenor at the Paris Opéra. During the next decade, Nourrit created such new roles in leading French operas as Aménophis in Gioacchino Rossini’s French version of his Mosè in Egitto, Arnold in Rossini’s Guillaume Tell, Eléazar in Fromental Halévy’s La Juive, for which Nourrit wrote the lyrics of the aria “Rachel, quand du seigneur,” Robert in Giacomo Meyerbeer’s Robert le diable, and Raoul in his Les Huguenots. He also wrote scenarios for four ballets, among them La Sylphide, and translated some of Franz Schubert’s songs for French performance.
When his rival, Gilbert Duprez, was also hired by the Opéra in 1837, Nourrit decided to leave Paris. He traveled to Italy for his health and to study with Gaetano Donizetti. He performed in Naples, but his voice was affected by his poor health. His career faltered in Italy, he became depressed, and finally he jumped to his death from his hotel in Naples.
