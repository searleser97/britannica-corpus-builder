Emanuele d’ Astorga, in full Emanuele Gioacchino Cesare Rincón, Baron (barone) d’Astorga,  (born March 20, 1680, Augusta, Sicily, Kingdom of Naples [Italy]—died 1757?, Madrid, Spain?), composer known for his dignified and moving Stabat Mater (c. 1707) and for his chamber cantatas, of which about 170 survive.
Astorga belonged to a family of Spanish descent that won a barony in Sicily in the 17th century. The family eventually settled in Palermo. Astorga’s first opera, La moglie nemica (“The Hostile Wife”), was performed privately at Palermo in 1698. Later he quarreled with his father and left home. In Rome he met the poet Sebastiano Biancardi, whose Rime (1732) contains information on Astorga. At Genoa both men were robbed, and they wrote the opera Dafni to raise money. After adventures under an assumed name, Astorga was summoned to Barcelona by the Spanish king Charles III; later he lived in Vienna.
Astorga returned to Palermo in 1715 to reclaim his family estates after his father’s death (1712). He married and became a senator, but in 1721 he left after restoring his wife’s dowry. He was subsequently in Lisbon and apparently passed through London en route to Bohemia. In 1744 his estates were sold to pay his wife’s debts. Johann Joseph Abert’s opera Astorga (1866) was based on his life.
