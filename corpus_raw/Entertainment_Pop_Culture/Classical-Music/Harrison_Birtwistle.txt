Harrison Birtwistle, in full Sir Harrison Birtwistle,  (born July 15, 1934, Accrington, Lancashire, England), British composer who began as a clarinetist and shifted to composition in his 20s. He was part of a generation of performers and composers known as the “Manchester School,” who, being from northern England, were unconstrained by London tradition and thus fully adopted modernism.
Birtwistle was born in an industrial town north of Manchester, England. He began to play the clarinet at the age of seven and later joined the Accrington military band. In 1952 he received a scholarship to attend the Royal Manchester College of Music (later the Royal Northern College of Music), studying with clarinetist Frederick Thurston and composer Richard Hall. He and his fellow students, including composers Peter Maxwell Davies and Alexander Goehr, became known as the “Manchester School” and would collaborate throughout their careers. Indeed, Birtwistle cofounded the Pierrot Players with, among others, Davies in 1967. Birtwistle served as a clarinetist with the band of the Royal Artillery (1955–57) and afterward studied with Reginald Kell at the Royal Academy of Music (1957–58), London.
Few of Birtwistle’s early compositions survive, and Refrains and Choruses for wind quintet is one of his first acknowledged works. When the piece was accepted for the Cheltenham Festival in 1959, Birtwistle, by his own account, decided to devote himself to composing and sold his clarinets. He concentrated on exploring large-scale time structures; his music’s form is controlled by complex cyclical principles that he declined to discuss. His works included the theatre pieces Punch and Judy (1966–67), The Mask of Orpheus (1973–84), and Gawain (1990–91; revised 1994) and the orchestral works The Triumph of Time (1971–72), Silbury Air (1977), Secret Theatre (1984), and Panic (1995).
Birtwistle’s operas from the 21st century included The Last Supper (1998–99), The Minotaur (2005–07), The Corridor (2008), and The Cure (2014–15). Other notable works included Theseus Game (2002) for large ensemble with two conductors; Angel Fighter (2010); In Broken Images (2011) for ensemble (after the Italian Renaissance composer Giovanni Gabrieli); The Moth Requiem (2012) for 12 female voices, 3 harps, and a flute; Songs from the Same Earth(2012–13), a song cycle for tenor and piano; Responses (2013–14) for piano and orchestra; and Deep Time (2016) for orchestra. Birtwistle received a knighthood in 1988 and became a Companion of Honour in 2001.
