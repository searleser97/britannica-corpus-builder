Frauenliebe und -leben, (German: “Woman’s Love and Life”)  song cycle by Robert Schumann, written in 1840, with text by the French-born German poet Adelbert von Chamisso. The text of the songs is written from a woman’s perspective.
Schumann wrote more than 130 musical settings of poems in 1840, the year in which he married Clara Wieck. He set several of Chamisso’s poems to music, both original works (such as Frauenliebe und -leben) and translations of Hans Christian Andersen. Frauenliebe und -leben includes eight songs, all of them written for the female voice with piano accompaniment. They present an evolving perspective on love and life. The first song reveals a young woman in the first flush of love. As the songs progress, she gives her whole heart and revels in the feelings of mature love. The last song is one of grief and pain, reflecting on the death of the beloved.
