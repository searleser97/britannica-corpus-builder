Clarinet Concerto in A, K 622,  three-movement concerto for clarinet and chamber orchestra (two flutes, two bassoons, two horns, and strings, including violins, viola, cello, and double bass) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart that blends gently lyrical passages with those of demanding virtuosity to create a masterpiece of the clarinet’s repertoire. It is widely considered the first great piece written for that relatively young instrument, invented in the early 18th century. Mozart wrote this concerto for a friend, Anton Stadler, who was the most gifted clarinetist in Vienna.
The Clarinet Concerto in A was Mozart’s only concerto for that instrument, and he completed the work just two months before his death in 1791. Stadler, who was himself a composer and a teacher whose students included members of the aristocratic Esterházy family, served on the staff of the Russian ambassador to Vienna before taking positions with the imperial court wind band and the imperial orchestra. Stadler was quite familiar with Mozart’s music, and he had participated in many performances of his friend’s symphonies and operas. M
ozart adapted his melodies specifically to Stadler’s own instrument (now called a basset clarinet), which had a more extended low range than standard clarinets. Stadler was also the inspiration for Mozart’s Clarinet Quintet, another of his great late works. The autograph manuscripts of both the concerto and the quintet were in Stadler’s care after Mozart’s death but are now lost.
