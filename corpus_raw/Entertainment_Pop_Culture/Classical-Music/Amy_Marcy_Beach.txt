Amy Marcy Beach, née Amy Marcy Cheney, married name Mrs. H.H.A. Beach,  (born Sept. 5, 1867, Henniker, N.H., U.S.—died  Dec. 27, 1944, New York, N.Y.), American pianist and composer known for her Piano Concerto (1900) and her Gaelic Symphony (1894), the first symphony by an American woman composer.
Amy Cheney had already demonstrated precocious musical talent when the family moved to Boston in 1870. She began taking piano lessons at age six, although she had been composing simple melodies on the keyboard since age four. In October 1883, at the age of 16, she gave her first public recital at Boston Music Hall. Several more successful recitals followed, and in March 1885 she played the Chopin Piano Concerto in F Minor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
In December 1885 she married Henry H.A. Beach, an eminent surgeon, Harvard University professor, and devoted amateur musician. He encouraged his wife to concentrate on composition, and, curtailing her public performing, she undertook a rigorous course of self-instruction in musical theory and composition. Her first efforts were in smaller forms—musical settings of favourite poems and other pieces—but in February 1892 she heard the Boston Symphony and the Handel and Haydn Society perform her Mass in E-flat (written 1890), her first major work (numbered Opus 5) and the first by a woman to be performed by those organizations. Her subsequent important compositions include "Eilende Wolken" (1892), an aria based on text by Friedrich von Schiller; Festival Jubilate (1891) for the dedication of the Woman’s Building at the World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893; the Gaelic Symphony; Sonata in A Minor (1896); and Piano Concerto in C-sharp Minor (1899).
Mrs. H.H.A. Beach, as she was known, was by far the preeminent woman composer in the United States, and her more than 150 numbered works, nearly all of which were published, also included choral works, church music, chamber works, cantatas, and songs to words of Shakespeare, Robert Burns, and Robert Browning. After the death of her husband in 1910, she spent the years 1911–14 in Europe, where her performances and compositions were widely acclaimed.
