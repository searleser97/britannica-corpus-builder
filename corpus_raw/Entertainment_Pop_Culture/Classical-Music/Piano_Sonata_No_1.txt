Piano Sonata No. 1, Op. 22,  sonata in four movements for piano and orchestra by Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera that premiered November 29, 1952, in Pittsburgh.
Ginastera was commissioned by the Carnegie Institute and the Pennsylvania College for Women to write a piano sonata for the Pittsburgh International Contemporary Music Festival. The performance was given by pianist Johana Harris, wife of American composer Roy Harris, and the work was dedicated to both Harrises. Ginasteraâ€™s intention for the piece was to capture the spirit of Argentine folk music without relying on explicit quotations from existing folk songs.
The first movement poses two contrasting themes that grow and evolve as the music progresses. The second movement is energetic and scherzolike; the third is lyrical, with an initial theme that returns after a contrasting middle section. The final movement is a driving toccata filled with busy rhythms.
