Brad Mehldau, byname of Bradford Alexander Mehldau,  (born August 23, 1970, Jacksonville, Florida, U.S.), American jazz pianist whose incorporation of rock elements into his performances made him one of the most influential jazz artists of his generation.
Like many notable jazz pianists, Mehldau was originally classically trained. He began studying piano at age six, and he became interested in jazz in his early teens. He played in the noted Hall High School jazz band in Hartford, Connecticut, and then studied jazz in New York City at the New School, graduating in 1993; there his teachers included jazz pianists Junior Mance, Fred Hersch, and Kenny Werner. After taking high-profile sideman jobs in New York City, Mehldau played (1994–95) with the quartet led by tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman. Mehldau also accompanied top musicians in jazz, country, and rock music. He played on four film soundtracks before composing the score for another film, Ma femme est un actrice (2001).
Meanwhile, Mehldau made his recording debut as a bandleader with Introducing Brad Mehldau (1995) and thereafter devoted much of his creative energy to working with his trio, which included bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge Rossy. (Jeff Ballard replaced Rossy on drums in 2005.) The trio was noted for its sensitive interplay and for Mehldau’s arrangements, often in uncommon metres (e.g., five or seven beats to the measure); their reputation grew, especially with a series of annual CDs titled The Art of the Trio (1997–2001). Subsequent albums credited to the Brad Mehldau Trio include Anything Goes (2004), Day Is Done (2005), Live (2008), Ode (2012), Blues and Ballads (2016), and Seymour Reads the Constitution! (2018).
Like Keith Jarrett, whom he cited as an influence, Mehldau also excelled as an unaccompanied pianist in improvisations that ranged from delicately played brooding ballads to grand harmonically rich rhapsodies. His repertoire was eclectic: he played tunes by pop performers, including Radiohead and Paul Simon, as well as jazz standards and his own original songs. The albums Elegiac Cycle (1999), Live in Tokyo (2004), Live in Marciac (2011), and After Bach (2018) were testaments to his virtuosity and versatility as a soloist.
The jazz idiom could not contain Mehldau’s ambitions, however. Over the years classical composers such as Johannes Brahms and Robert Schumann often influenced his jazz stylings. Mehldau entered the classical realm himself when he composed settings of poems by Rainer Maria Rilke and Louise Bogan. Mehldau accompanied the soprano Renée Fleming’s performances of the songs, which they recorded on the 2006 album Love Sublime. Collaborations with pop producer Jon Brion, on the albums Largo (2002) and Highway Rider (2010), and jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, on Metheny Mehldau (2006) and Quartet (2007), took Mehldau in additional inventive directions. Further innovation was on display in his work with drummer Mark Guiliana on Mehliana: Taming the Dragon (2014) and on Chris Thile & Brad Mehldau (2017), recorded with bluegrass musician Thile. He reunited with Redman for Nearness (2016) and with Redman’s quartet for RoundAgain (2020). Long Ago and Far Away (2018) featured bassist Charlie Haden, and Finding Gabriel (2019) took its inspiration from the Old Testament
