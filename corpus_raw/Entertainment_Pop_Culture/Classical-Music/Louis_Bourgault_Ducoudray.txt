Louis Bourgault-Ducoudray, in full Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray,  (born February 2, 1840, Nantes, France—died July 4, 1910, Vernouillet), French composer and musicologist who influenced his contemporaries through his research on folk music.
Bourgault-Ducoudray studied at the Paris Conservatoire, where he was a pupil of composer Ambroise Thomas. He wrote his first opera, L’Atelier de Prague, at age 18 and in 1862 was awarded the Prix de Rome for his cantata Louise de Mézières. In 1878 he was appointed professor of music history at the Paris Conservatoire, a position he held through 1908.
Bourgault-Ducoudray wrote operas, orchestral works, and chamber music, but his fame as a composer and arranger rests on his Trente mélodies populaires de Grèce et d’Orient (1876; “Thirty Popular Melodies from Greece and the Orient”), Trente mélodies populaires de Basse Bretagne (1885; “Thirty Popular Melodies from Lower Brittany”), and Quatorze mélodies celtiques (1909; “Fourteen Celtic Melodies”), which fostered a new approach to folk music in France through their use of the original modal scales. He thus anticipated 20th-century music, being one of those who provided Claude Debussy with the evocative archaism that through him became an essential element in modern musical style. Bourgault-Ducoudray’s writings include books on the Greek modes and European folk music.
