Carl Ruggles, original name in full Charles Sprague Ruggles,  (born March 11, 1876, Marion, Mass., U.S.—died  Oct. 24, 1971, Bennington, Vt.), American composer and painter whose musical works, small in number, are characterized by highly dissonant, nonmetric melodies, wide dynamic range, and rich colouring.
Ruggles played the violin for President Grover Cleveland at age nine; though a close friend of such innovative and influential composers as Charles Ives and Edgard Varèse, he was largely self-taught, save for some music study at Harvard University. For five years following 1912, he conducted an orchestra that he founded at Winona, Minn., after which he was active in composers’ organizations in New York (1923–33) and taught composition in Florida (1937). A patron made it possible for Ruggles to devote most of his energy to composition and painting, particularly in the Abstract Expressionist idiom. Because Ruggles destroyed his early compositions, he is known only through a few remaining works. He was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1954.
Among the works released by Ruggles, The Sun-Treader for orchestra (1926–31) is the longest and most important. It is highly dissonant and complex, rhapsodic and imaginative, characteristics typical of other works by Ruggles. Fond of mystical poetry, he sought sublime, impressionistic effects; this practice led some critics to attack his compositions as being vague and unclear. Ruggles worked over his compositions so that some exist in several different versions. His works include Toys for voice and piano (1919), Men and Angels for orchestra (1920; revised for brass, 1939), Men and Mountains for chamber orchestra (first performed, 1924; revised for full orchestra, 1936), and the hymn Exaltation (1958).
