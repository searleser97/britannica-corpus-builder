Choral Fantasy in C Minor, Op. 80,  composition for orchestra, chorus, and solo piano by Ludwig van Beethoven that premiered in Vienna on December 22, 1808, together with his Symphony No. 5 and Symphony No. 6.
Choral Fantasy was composed as a grand finale to the mammoth concert of December 22 (which, in addition to the debuted works, included a concert aria, two movements from Mass in C Major, and Piano Concerto No. 4), and its unusual scoring arose from the requirements of the other pieces on the program.
The title might have puzzled audience members, who at that time were accustomed to a “fantasy” being a solo keyboard work. Indeed, the work begins with a lengthy solo piano passage that Beethoven himself improvised at the premiere. The orchestra then joins in, creating a concerto-like effect. The chorus enters for the grand finale.
Many scholars have pointed out a resemblance between this work and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9, known as the Choral Symphony, which premiered in 1824. Indeed, there are strong similarities between the two works’ principal melodies. Another parallel lies in the philosophies expounded by the two texts. The symphony, based on a poem by Friedrich Schiller, praises the brotherhood and goodwill that arise from shared joy. Similarly, the text of Choral Fantasy proclaims in its concluding measures, “When love and power unite, God’s grace descends on all mankind.”
The identity of the librettist is uncertain. Some sources cite Georg Friedrich Treitschke, who also provided the text for Beethoven’s only opera, Fidelio. Yet Beethoven’s student Carl Czerny insisted that another poet, Christoph Kuffner, should be credited.
