Jean-Marie Leclair, the Elder,  (born May 10, 1697, Lyon—died  Oct. 22, 1764, Paris), French violinist, composer, and dancing master who established the French school of violin playing.
In 1722 Leclair was principal dancer and ballet master at Turin. After finishing his violin studies with G.B. Somis, he went to Paris and began in 1728 a brilliant career as a violinist-composer. By 1732 he was the subject of an article in J.G. Walther’s Musicalisches Lexicon.
He later became a musician of the royal chamber and visited several princely courts. Leclair, whose last years were clouded by despair and distrust, was murdered, possibly by his estranged wife.
He published four books of sonatas for violin and continuo, two books of sonatas for two unaccompanied violins, five sets of Récréations for two violins and continuo, and two sets of string concerti. He also wrote an opera, Scylla et Glaucus.
His brothers Jean-Marie Leclair the Younger (1703–77), Pierre Leclair (1709–84), and Jean-Benoît Leclair (1714–after 1759) were also composers and violinists.
