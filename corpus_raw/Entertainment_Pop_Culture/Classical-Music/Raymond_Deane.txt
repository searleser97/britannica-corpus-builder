Raymond Deane,  (born January 27, 1953, Tuam, County Galway, Ireland), Irish composer and pianist known for being an outspoken advocate on behalf of contemporary Irish classical composers.
Deane was raised on Achill Island and at age 10 moved to Dublin with his family. He began taking piano lessons at the Dublin College of Music, and, according to Deane, already at that very young age he knew he wanted to be a composer. In 1969, at age 16, he had his debut performance as a composer in the first Dublin Festival of 20th-Century Music, with a piano piece titled Format I. He studied music at University College Dublin (1970–74) and in 1972 became a founding member of the Association of Young Irish Composers (now the Association of Irish Composers). In 1973 he composed Embers, a string quartet that remains one of his best-known and most-important works. Between 1974 and 1977 Deane studied with Gerald Bennett at the Music Academy in Basel, Switzerland, and with Karlheinz Stockhausen at the State Academy for Music in Cologne, Germany. He studied with Korean-born German composer Isang Yun in 1978 at what is now the Berlin University of the Arts. 
Throughout the late 1970s until 1988, Deane struggled with alcoholism, and his career stalled. He did compose a number of pieces during that time, many of which were for piano. Once sober he began receiving significant commissions as well as invitations to Irish music festivals, and his career began to flourish. He was the Irish delegate to the International Society for Contemporary Music World Music Days held in Mexico (1993), Sweden (1994), and Germany (1995). In the mid- to late 1990s he composed several major works, including Concerto for Oboe and Large Orchestra (1993–94); a full-length opera, The Wall of Cloud (1997); a string quartet, Brown Studies (1997–98); and the critically acclaimed Ripieno (1998–99), which premiered with the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland in 2000. During the 1990s Deane also became increasingly outspoken on behalf of the largely unrecognized contemporary Irish composers. (He had become a member of Aosdána, the state-sponsored association of Irish artists, in 1986.) His activism reached beyond the music community when he became particularly vocal regarding human rights issues in Palestine and began to write articles in leftist news outlets on a regular basis. In 2001 he founded the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, a group that organizes cultural boycotts of Israel.
Deane’s reputation as a leading Irish composer was confirmed in 2001 when his 1993 piece Seachanges (with Danse Macabre) was chosen as mandatory learning for the Leaving Certificate music curriculum, a graduation requirement for secondary-school students in Ireland. He was also chosen as the artistic director for the first two RTÉ (Radio Television Ireland) Living Music festivals in Dublin (2002 and 2004). Other notable works by Deane included Noctuary (2010–11), a cycle of 12 pieces for piano, commissioned by Irish pianist Hugh Tinney, and The Alma Fetish, an opera about the love affair between Alma Mahler, wife of Austrian composer Gustav Mahler, and Austrian artist Oskar Kokoschka (2006–12). His works from the second half of the 2010s comprised Raccordement (2017) for solo piano; Galar an ghrá (“The Disease of Love”; 2019), three songs for baritone and piano with words from the 16th-century Irish soldier Manus O’Donnell’s poems; and Vagabones (2019), an opera based on Irish writer Emma Donoghue’s 1996 radio play Trespasses. Deane also wrote two books: a novel, Death of a Medium (1991), and a memoir, In My Own Light (2014).
