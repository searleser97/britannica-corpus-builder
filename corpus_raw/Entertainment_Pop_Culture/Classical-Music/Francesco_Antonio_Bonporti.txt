Francesco Antonio Bonporti,  (baptized June 11, 1672, Trento [Italy]—died Dec. 19, 1749, Padua), Italian composer notable for his highly original Invenzioni, short instrumental suites from which Johann Sebastian Bach took the title for his keyboard Inventions.
Bonporti studied theology and composition in Rome, was ordained, and returned to Trento; in 1697 he was appointed to a minor position at the city’s cathedral that he held for more than 40 years. Constantly disappointed in his hope for ecclesiastical preferment, he retired to Padua in 1740. Although he worked in isolation from the contemporary musical world, his compositions became widely known. His numerous trio sonatas (1696–1705), violin sonatas and concerti, and the 10 Invenzioni (1712) show rich harmonies, unconventional handling of melody and rhythm, and a novel use of instrumental recitative style. Four of the Invenzioni were included by mistake in the Bachgesellschaft edition of Bach’s works, and the fourth was published by the English composer Henry Eccles as his own.
