François-Antoine Habeneck,  (born Jan. 22, 1781, Mézières, Fr.—died  Feb. 8, 1849, Paris), French violinist, conductor, and composer.
Habeneck studied violin first with his father, a military bandsman of German descent, and then with Pierre Baillot at the Paris Conservatory. In 1804 he won the institution’s first prize for violin and took a position with the Opéra. Through a series of promotions, he attained the title of premier chef, his 22-year tenure covering one of the organization’s finest periods. Generally conducting with a violin bow, he premiered works by Rossini, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Fromental Halévy, and Berlioz, drawing praise for the integrity of his interpretation and the uniform bowing of his string section. It was largely through his efforts that Beethoven’s works were introduced into France: toward this end he organized special performances of the Opéra orchestra called concerts spirituels and in 1829 founded the Société des Concerts du Conservatoire, which built its programming around Beethoven’s music until Habeneck’s death. He published a violin method and composed primarily for that instrument.
