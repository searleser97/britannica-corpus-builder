He published his First Set of English Madrigals in 1613; it was republished in volume 19 (1922) of The English Madrigal School. Works by Ward appeared in William Leighton’s Teares or Lamentacions of a Sorrowful Soule (1614), Thomas Ravenscroft’s Whole Booke of Psalmes (1621), and John Barnard’s Selected Church Musick (1641).
