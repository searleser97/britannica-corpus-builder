Lukas Foss, original name Lukas Fuchs,  (born Aug. 15, 1922, Berlin, Ger.—died Feb. 1, 2009, New York, N.Y., U.S.), German-born U.S. composer, pianist, and conductor, widely recognized for his experiments with improvisation and aleatory music.
He studied in Berlin and Paris and, after moving to the United States in 1937, with the composers Randall Thompson and Paul Hindemith and the conductors Serge Koussevitzky and Fritz Reiner. Foss published his first work at age 15, and in 1945 he became the youngest composer to win a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1957, while a professor of composition and the orchestra director at the University of California at Los Angeles, he founded the Improvisation Chamber Ensemble, which was the vehicle of many of his experiments in music generally described as aleatory (chance) and stochastic (based on a system of mathematical probability).
In 1963 Foss founded and became director of the Center for Creative and Performing Arts at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Among the orchestras with which he worked as music director and conductor are the Buffalo Philharmonic (1963–70), the Brooklyn Philharmonia (1971–90; later Brooklyn Philharmonic), and the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra (1981–86).
Foss’s early works are neoclassical—tonal and well-organized in harmony and counterpoint. These early works include symphonic music (Ode; first performed in 1945), cantatas, and chamber music, as well as a ballet score (Gift of the Magi, 1945). One of his early concerti, Piano Concerto No. 2 (1951, revised in 1953), won a Music Critics’ Award. An opera, Griffelkin (1955), was commissioned by the National Broadcasting Company and first performed on television.
His later chamber pieces, including Echoi (1963) and Elytres (1964), are avant-garde, ordering musical events by means of chance operations and leaving many decisions about the performance to the performers. Otherwise notable among his later compositions are his Divertissement for string quartet (1972); the orchestral work Folksong (1975); American Cantata for tenor, soprano, two speakers, chorus, and orchestra (1977); and Celebration, written for the 50th anniversary (July 6, 1990) of the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, Mass. Foss, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, was a guest conductor with the world’s major symphonies. In 1991 he became a professor at Boston University.
