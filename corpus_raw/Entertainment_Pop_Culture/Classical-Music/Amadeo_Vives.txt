Amadeo Vives,  (born Nov. 18, 1871, Collbató, Spain—died Dec. 1, 1932, Madrid), Spanish composer noted for his nearly 100 light operas.
After study in Barcelona, Vives founded (1891), with Luis Millet, the choral society Orfeó Catalá. His first opera, Artus, produced in Barcelona in 1895, made use of Catalan folk songs, and Euda d’Uriach (Barcelona, 1900) originally had a Catalan libretto. His most popular opera probably was Maruxa (Madrid, 1914). Other well-known operas include Balada de carnaval (Madrid, 1919) and Doña Francis-quita (Madrid, 1923), the latter inspired by Lope de Vega’s play La discreta enamorata. Vives also composed more serious music, including Canciones epigramáticas, a series of songs with texts from some of the great Spanish poets. He published a book of essays, Sofia, in 1923.
