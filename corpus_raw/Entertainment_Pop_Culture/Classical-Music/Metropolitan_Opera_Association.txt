Metropolitan Opera, byname the Met,  in New York City, leading U.S. opera company, distinguished for the outstanding singers it has attracted since its opening performance (Gounod’s Faust) on October 22, 1883. After its first season under Henry E. Abbey ended in a $600,000 deficit, its management passed to the conductor Leopold Damrosch and later to his son, conductor and composer Walter Damrosch. In 1892, under Abbey, Walter Schoeffel, and Maurice Grau, the programming was a balance of German, French, and Italian. Grau, as manager during the Met’s “Golden Age” (1898–1903), drew many excellent artists from all over the world.
Heinrich Conried, manager from 1903 to 1908, arranged performances of Richard Wagner’s Parsifal (first performance outside Bayreuth, Germany) and Richard Strauss’s Salome, which so shocked its audience that it was withdrawn. During Giulio Gatti-Casazza’s 25 years as general manager, weekly radio broadcasts were inaugurated.
Under Edward Johnson (general manager 1934–50), American composers and artists were encouraged. His successor, Rudolf Bing, made innovations in staging and brought the first African American singers to the Met’s stage. He also arranged the Met’s first televised performance and organized its touring company. In 1966 the Met moved to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York City.
James Levine made his conducting debut with the Met in 1971 and became music director in 1976, a position he held through 2016. The following year Yannick Nézet-Séguin became music director-designate. He assumed the role of director for the 2018–19 season, two years earlier than anticipated due to the suspension (and later firing) of director emeritus Levine, who was accused of sexual misconduct before and during his tenure at the Met.
