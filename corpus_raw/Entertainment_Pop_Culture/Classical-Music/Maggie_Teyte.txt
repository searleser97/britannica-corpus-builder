Dame Maggie Teyte, original name Margaret Tate,  (born April 17, 1888, Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, Eng.—died  May 26, 1976, London), English soprano, a well-known opera, concert, and recording artist who was considered one of the 20th century’s foremost interpreters of French song.
Teyte studied at the Royal College of Music in London as a child, and in 1903 she moved to Paris to study voice with Jean de Reszke. She made her concert debut in 1906 in a W.A. Mozart festival organized by Reynaldo Hahn and her operatic debut in 1907 in Monte-Carlo. Her first great opportunity came in 1908, when Claude Debussy chose her to succeed Mary Garden as Mélisande in the original production of his Pelléas et Mélisande in Paris. She was an immediate success and was considered by many to be superior to Garden in the role. Debussy later performed with Teyte in a number of concerts in Paris. Among the opera companies with which she performed were the Chicago Opera Company, the Boston Opera Company, the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, the Opéra-Comique in Paris, and several British organizations, including the Beecham Opera Company, the British National Opera Company, and Covent Garden in London.
The 1937 release of Teyte’s recording of a Debussy recital with Alfred Cortot at the piano brought her into international prominence as an interpreter of French song. In 1940 this was followed by an album of French song from Hector Berlioz to Debussy with both piano and orchestral accompaniment. Her last operatic appearance was as Belinda in Henry Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas at the Mermaid Theater, London, in 1951. Her last concert appearance was at the Festival Hall, London, in 1955. She was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1957 and a Dame of the British Empire in 1958.
