Gilbert Duprez, in full Gilbert-Louis Duprez,  (born December 6, 1806, Paris, France—died September 23, 1896, Paris), French tenor, teacher of voice, and composer.
Duprez studied at the Paris Conservatory. In 1825 he made his debut at the Odéon Theatre, Paris, as Almaviva in Gioachino Rossini’s Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville). After limited success at the Odéon, he went to Italy for further study and achieved considerable popularity, notably in Naples, where Gaetano Donizetti chose him for the role of Edgardo in the premiere of his Lucia di Lammermoor in 1835.
Duprez returned to France and established himself as the first Romantic tenor, known for his clarion high register and exaggerated acting. Between 1837 and 1847 he was a leading member of the Paris Opéra and created such roles as Benvenuto Cellini in Hector Berlioz’ opera of the same name and Fernando in Donizetti’s La favorite. He also sang in London and Germany and joined the Paris Conservatory, where he taught from 1842 to 1850. His success as a singing teacher led him in 1853 to found his own singing school. He composed six operas, which were produced between 1826 and 1865, and wrote several pedagogical and popular books, including L’Art du chant (1845; “The Art of Singing”), Souvenirs d’un chanteur (1880; “Memories of a Singer”), and Récréations de mon grand âge (1888).
