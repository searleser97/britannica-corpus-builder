Kurt Herbert Adler,  (born April 2, 1905, Vienna, Austria—died February 9, 1988, Ross, California, U.S.), Austrian-born American conductor and administrator who transformed the San Francisco Opera into one of the nation’s leading opera companies.
Adler was educated in Vienna at the Academy of Music, the Conservatory, and the University of Vienna. In the decade following his debut as a conductor at Vienna’s Max Reinhardt Theatre (1925–28), he conducted in various opera houses across Europe and assisted Arturo Toscanini at the 1936 Salzburg Festival. In 1938 he fled from the German annexation of Austria and emigrated to the United States, where he became guest conductor at the Chicago Opera (1938–43) and an American citizen (1941).
Adler left Chicago when Gaetano Merola, the founder of the San Francisco Opera, hired him to join his staff as a chorus director and conductor (1943–53). After Merola’s death, Adler assumed control of the company as artistic director (1953–57) and general director (1957–81). Under his leadership, the San Francisco Opera shed its modest regional status to become an international company with a bold, innovative repertory. He expanded the budget, doubled the length of the regular season, added spring and summer seasons, enlisted new artists, and fostered inventive programs such as the San Francisco Opera Auditions (1954), the Merola Opera Program (1957), and the Brown Bag Opera (1974). During his tenure, the San Francisco Opera gave two world and 18 American premieres and introduced many notable artists to the American opera stage, including singers Boris Christoff, Birgit Nilsson, Leontyne Price, and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and conductor Sir Georg Solti. Adler recorded albums with such opera greats as tenors Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo. After his retirement in 1981, the San Francisco Opera named him general director emeritus.
