Jeremiah Clarke,  (born c. 1674, London, Eng.—died  Dec. 1, 1707, London), English organist and composer, mainly of religious music. His Trumpet Voluntary was once attributed to Henry Purcell.
Clarke was master of choristers at St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1704, and in the same year with William Croft he became joint organist of the Chapel Royal. In addition to composing many anthems, he also set to music John Dryden’s poem “Alexander’s Feast.” His Trumpet Voluntary was originally either a harpsichord piece or a work for wind ensemble. He also composed solo songs and incidental music for plays.
