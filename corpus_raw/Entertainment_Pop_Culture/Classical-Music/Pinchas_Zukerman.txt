Pinchas Zukerman,  (born July 16, 1948, Tel Aviv, Israel), Israeli American violinist, violist, and conductor who earned widespread acclaim in a career that spanned more than five decades.
Zukerman began playing at about the age of seven; when he was eight he entered the Tel Aviv Academy of Music. In 1962, sponsored by violinist Isaac Stern, he went to New York City to study at the Juilliard School, remaining there until 1967. Thereafter he appeared as a soloist throughout North America, and after his New York debut in 1969 he toured frequently in Europe. Among his recordings are the complete Beethoven violin sonatas (with Daniel Barenboim) and piano trios (with Barenboim and Jacqueline du Pré). A close friend of violinist Itzhak Perlman, Zukerman (playing the viola) frequently performed with him. He began conducting chamber music in 1974.
Zukerman served as musical director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra (1980–87) in Minnesota and of the National Arts Centre Orchestra (1999–2015) in Canada. In 2009 he became principal guest conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London while continuing to perform with other orchestras around the world.
