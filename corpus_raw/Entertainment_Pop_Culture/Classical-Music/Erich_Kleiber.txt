Erich Kleiber,  (born Aug. 5, 1890, Vienna, Austria—died  Jan. 27, 1956, Zürich, Switz.), Austrian conductor who performed many 20th-century works but was especially known for his performances of works by W.A. Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Richard Wagner, and Richard Strauss and for his fidelity to composers’ intentions.
Kleiber studied in Prague and between 1912 and 1922 conducted at several German opera houses. In 1923 he became general music director of the Berlin State Opera, where he gave the first performance of Alban Berg’s Wozzeck in 1925. In 1935 he left Germany. He conducted German opera at Buenos Aires (1936–49) and became an Argentine citizen. In 1954 he became chief conductor of the Berlin State Opera (in East Berlin) but resigned in 1955 after difficulties with the East German government. He composed concerti for piano and for violin, orchestral and chamber works, and songs.
