Lillian Nordica, original name Lilian Norton,  (born May 12, 1857, Farmington, Maine, U.S.—died May 10, 1914, Batavia, Java, Dutch East Indies [now Jakarta, Indon.]), American soprano, acclaimed for her opulent voice and dramatic presence, especially in Wagnerian roles.
Nordica grew up from the age of six in Boston, studied at the New England Conservatory of Music, and then gave recitals in the United States and London before resuming study in Milan. In 1879 she made her debut in Milan as Donna Elvira in W.A. Mozart’s Don Giovanni and in Brescia, Italy, as Violetta in Giuseppe Verdi’s La traviata. After singing in many Italian, German, and Russian cities, she made her Paris Opéra debut in 1882 as Marguerite in Charles Gounod’s Faust.
In 1887 Nordica first appeared in London at Covent Garden and until 1893 performed there and at Drury Lane in such parts as Lucia, Donna Elvira, and Aida. In 1894 she was engaged at Bayreuth, Germany—the first American to be so honoured—as Elsa in Richard Wagner’s Lohengrin, and her tumultuous reception was such that she thereafter concentrated on Wagnerian parts. In 1895 she sang Isolde at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, where she remained until 1909, excelling especially as Brünnhilde and Kundry. After retiring from the Metropolitan, she launched a world farewell tour that ended in 1913 when her ship grounded in the Gulf of Papua in December. She contracted pneumonia and died of complications of the disease. Nordica’s Hints to Singers, which included many of her letters, was published in 1923.
