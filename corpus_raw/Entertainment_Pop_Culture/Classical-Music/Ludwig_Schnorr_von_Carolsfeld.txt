Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld,  (born July 2, 1836, Munich, Bavaria [Germany]—died  July 21, 1865, Dresden, Saxony), German tenor, known for his Wagnerian roles.
Schnorr made his first solo appearance in 1855 with the Karlsruhe Opera. He married the singer Malvina Garrigues and moved to Dresden in 1860, where he established himself as a singer in lieder and oratorio as well as opera. Among the roles in which he was especially admired were Tannhäuser and Lohengrin.
Richard Wagner heard Schnorr in 1862 and asked him and his wife to study the title roles in Tristan und Isolde. The physical demands of the opera caused them some concern, but Wagner persuaded them to undertake it. The first performance of Tristan und Isolde occurred on June 10, 1865, in Munich after a particularly demanding rehearsal period. Schnorr developed a chill but went on to perform three more times as Tristan, once as Erik in Die fliegende Holländer (his last public performance), and at a private concert before Ludwig II. He returned to Dresden and began rehearsals for Don Giovanni but developed a feverish condition that led to delirium, rampant gout, and finally to a stroke five days later. On his deathbed he burst into song and called on Wagner’s name.
