Empfindsamer Stil, (German: “sensitive style”) also called Empfindsamkeit (“sensitivity”),  important movement occurring in northern German instrumental music during the mid-18th century and characterized by an emphasis upon the expression of a variety of deeply felt emotions within a musical work. This aesthetic is typical of an age that was much given to the expression of moving sentiments not only in art but in everyday life.
Closely allied with “sensitivity” was the desire to give a composition an aura of simplicity and naturalness, qualities highly prized in the philosophical outlook of the Enlightenment. The composers wanted to increase the effect of their music by imbuing each theme with a well-defined, even exaggerated, expressive character. Because the effect seemed to be considerably intensified by rapid changes of mood, phrases and sections of highly contrasting moods were placed in juxtaposition.
The most significant representatives of the empfindsamer Stil were Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Johann Joachim Quantz, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Johann Abraham Peter Schulz, and Jiří Antonín Benda.
