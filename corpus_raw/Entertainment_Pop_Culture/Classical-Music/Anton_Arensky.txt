Anton Arensky, in full Anton Stepanovich Arensky,  (born June 30 [July 12, New Style], 1861, Novgorod, Russia—died February 12 [February 25], 1906, Terijoki, Finland, Russian Empire), Russian composer known especially for his chamber music and songs.
Although he was a composition student under Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, Arensky’s work was more akin to that of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky; the predominant moods of his music are lyrical and elegiac. Of his three operas only the first, A Dream on the Volga (performed 1891, Moscow), was successful. His Piano Trio in D Minor and String Quartet in A Minor show him at his best. His piano pieces, which exceed 100 in number, include four suites for two pianos. Besides conducting in Moscow, he held teaching posts at the Moscow Conservatory from 1882 to 1895 and the directorship of the imperial chapel at St. Petersburg from 1895 to 1901.
