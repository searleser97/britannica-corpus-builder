Woodwind Sonatas,  group of three sonatas for piano and a woodwind instrument composed by Camille Saint-Saëns and completed in 1921. The three complementary works are the Sonata for Oboe and Piano in D Major, Op. 166, the Sonata for Clarinet and Piano in E-flat Major, Op. 167, and the Sonata for Bassoon and Piano in G Major, Op. 168. Saint-Saëns used these works to showcase instruments until then rarely featured. The oboe and bassoon, for example, had been heard often in the Baroque era but had received little attention thereafter. The clarinet too had gained little notice, and, in the Romantic era, only Brahms had written for it. The Woodwind Sonatas were among Saint-Saëns’s last finished compositions.
