Róza Déryné Széppataki, Hungarian form Déryné Széppataki Róza, née Róza Schenbach,  (born Dec. 24, 1793, Jászberény [now Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok county], Hung.—died Sept. 29, 1872, Miskolc [now Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county]), the first female Hungarian opera singer and the most famous Hungarian actress of the first half of the 19th century.
Her parents sent her to Pest (now part of Budapest), then a predominantly German city, to learn the German language. In 1810 she joined the theatre company working in Hacker Salle (Hacker Hall), which served as a temporary space for the company until the German Theatre of Pest building opened in 1812. During this time she met the company’s dramaturge, József Katona, later the author of the classic national tragedy Bánk bán. Katona fell in love with her, but she married her colleague István Déry. Soon after, she changed her German surname to the Hungarian Széppataki. She played a large variety of roles, but her successes were usually as an ingenue or comedienne. In 1823 she joined the theatre company in Kolozsvár (now Cluj, Rom.), but the most fruitful period in her career was from 1828 to 1837, when she performed in Kassa (now Košice, Slvk). In 1837 she moved to the Pest National Theatre. By that time, however, the leading critics judged her performance style to be dated, and she was obliged to return to stages in provincial towns. In 1847 she retired completely. Her diaries, which are a major source for the history of Hungarian theatre, were published in two volumes in 1879.
