Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach,  (born June 21, 1732, Leipzig—died  Jan. 26, 1795, Bückeburg, Prussia), longest surviving son of J.S. and Anna Magdalena Bach.
Probably educated by his father’s cousin Johann Elias Bach, J.C.F. Bach became a chamber musician to Count Wilhelm at Bückeburg in 1750, and was appointed concertmaster 1759. His career was steady and his output of compositions extensive. He made a successful transition from the late Baroque style into the early Classical style. His compositions were well received, and although they did not lead their times, they kept successfully abreast of them. He is at his best in his later symphonies, similar in style to those of Haydn. He also composed motets, oratorios (some in collaboration with the poet Johann Gottfried von Herder), sonatas and other works for keyboard, chamber cantatas, and instrumental chamber works.
