Dimitri Mitropoulos,  (born March 1, 1896, Athens—died  Nov. 2, 1960, Milan), conductor known for his performances of 20th-century works.
Mitropoulos studied in Athens, where his opera Soeur Béatrice (after Maeterlinck) was performed in 1919. Later in Berlin he studied piano under the brilliant pianist, composer, and teacher Ferruccio Busoni. An excellent pianist, Mitropoulos sometimes conducted from the keyboard (e.g., in 1930 and 1932 with Sergey Prokofiev’s Third Piano Concerto). He did not use a baton, and even in rehearsal he conducted from memory. He was one of the earliest conductors to perform twelve-tone works of Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and others.
Mitropoulos conducted at the Berlin State Opera (1921–24) and directed the Athens Conservatory until 1930. From 1937 to 1949 he directed the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra. Although he rejected the traditional social obligations of the position, he won a devoted following. He was musical director of the New York Philharmonic (1951–58), where he introduced concert performances of contemporary operas. From 1954 he conducted at the Metropolitan Opera, becoming principal conductor in 1958. He died while rehearsing with the orchestra of La Scala in Milan.
