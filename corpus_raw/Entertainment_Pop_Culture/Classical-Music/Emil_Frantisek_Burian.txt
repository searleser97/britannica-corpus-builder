Emil František Burian,  (born June 11, 1904, Plzeň, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now in Czech Republic]—died  August 9, 1959, Prague, Czechoslovakia), Czech author, composer, playwright, and theatre and film director whose eclectic stage productions drew upon a wide variety of art forms and technologies for their effects.
At the age of 19, while still a student, Burian completed the music for the first of his six operas, Alladine and Pallomides, based on the play by Maurice Maeterlinck (1923). He continued his studies in musical composition under Josef Foerster at the Prague Conservatory, leaving in 1927 to work with various unconventional cabarets and music groups.
In 1929 Burian accepted a one-year appointment as literary adviser to the Modern Studio of Prague and, later on, positions as director at theatres in Brno and Olomouc. His theatrical apprenticeship completed, Burian returned to Prague in 1933 to open his own theatre, D34. That theatre (the name would change annually to reflect the current year) made Burian internationally famous. D34 and its successors saw Burian mount productions by contemporary Czechs and other Europeans, as well as reworkings of many older classics. The productions combined dance, film, song, live instrumental music, acting, projections, signboards, phonograph recordings, choral reading, and stage machinery in a manner similar to the multimedia work of Erwin Piscator and V.Y. Meyerhold. D34 established the traditions for Czech theatre practice later exemplified by the work of Josef Svoboda.
Though broken in health after being committed to a concentration camp by the Nazis (1941–45), Burian returned to Prague after the war to reopen D46 and extend his activities to journalism and politics. He was elected to Parliament in 1948. In 1951, D51 was renamed the Army Theatre of Art, and Burian was made a colonel. He was declared a national artist of Czechoslovakia in 1954. Burian wrote several books on the theory of drama and on music.
