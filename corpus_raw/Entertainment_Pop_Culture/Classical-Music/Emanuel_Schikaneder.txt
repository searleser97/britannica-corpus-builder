Emanuel Schikaneder, pseudonym of Johann Joseph Schikaneder,  (born September 1, 1751, Straubing, Bavaria [Germany]—died September 21, 1812, Vienna [Austria]), prominent German actor, singer, playwright, and theatre manager now chiefly remembered as the librettist of Mozart’s opera Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute).
Schikaneder began his career as an actor with a small traveling company performing the improvised farce and song then popular, but by age 22 he had written and starred in his first operetta. Five years later he was the manager of his own company. His repertoire included plays by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, J.W. von Goethe, and Pedro Calderón. His Shakespearean roles, especially, were widely admired, and he was particularly notable as Hamlet. The company also performed farces and Singspiele (operettas), and Schikaneder’s growing interest in the musical theatre led in 1780 to his acquaintance with the Mozart family.
By 1784 the Schikaneder company had received the favourable notice of the emperor, Joseph II, and had settled in Vienna. There Schikaneder turned his attention to opera, commissioning from contemporary composers the musical scores to fit his own libretti. His libretto for The Magic Flute, set to music by his friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and his superb performance in the role of Papageno at the premiere in 1791 raised him to the peak of his popularity. His productions grew increasingly sumptuous, and by the time he opened the Theater an der Wien (1801), built especially for him, the costs were becoming ruinous. Schikaneder retained management of the theatre for less than four years, a period marked by an abortive attempt at collaboration on an opera with Ludwig van Beethoven. Schikaneder left Vienna to manage theatres in Brno and Pest, but he eventually returned to the Austrian capital, where he died impoverished and insane.
