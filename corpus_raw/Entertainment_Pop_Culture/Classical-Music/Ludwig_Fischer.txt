Ludwig Fischer, in full Johann Ignaz Ludwig Fischer,  (born Aug. 18, 1745, Mainz, archbishopric of Mainz [Germany]—died  July 10, 1825, Berlin, Prussia [Germany]), German operatic bass, famed for his vocal range of two and a half octaves.
Although originally a student of the violin and cello, Fischer was discovered at the age of 18 in a church choir and in a student operetta and was given a position at court. With the help of a grant by Elector Karl Theodor he continued vocal studies with the tenor Anton Raaff in Mannheim. By 1775 he became a singing teacher himself and in 1778 moved with the court to Munich, where he was a great success. He married the singer Barbara Strasser, and in 1780 they moved to Vienna, where Fischer won the admiration of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who chose him to create the role of Osmin in Die Entführung aus dem Serail (1782). In 1783 Fischer appeared successfully in Paris at the Concert Spirituel; he then toured Italy and in 1785 performed in Dresden, Vienna, and Prague. In 1789 he became a permanent member of the court opera in Berlin, making guest appearances in London, Leipzig, and Hamburg. He retired from the stage in 1812.
Fischer was also a composer, and his drinking song “Im kühlen Keller sitz’ ich hier” in the Singspiel Der Kritikaster und der Trinker remains well known. His son and two daughters also became distinguished singers.
