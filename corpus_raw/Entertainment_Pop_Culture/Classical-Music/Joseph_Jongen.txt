Joseph Jongen, in full Joseph-Marie-Alphonse-Nicolas Jongen,  (born Dec. 14, 1873, Liège, Belg.—died  July 12, 1953, Sart-les-Spa, near Liège),  composer who is often considered second only to César Franck among Belgian composers.
Jongen studied at the Liège Conservatory and later in Italy, France, and Germany. In 1903 he became professor of harmony and counterpoint at Liège. As a refugee in England during World War I he formed a piano quartet with violinist Désiré Defauw, violist Lionel Tertis, and cellist Émile Doehaerd. In 1920 he taught at the Brussels Conservatory, and he was its director from 1925 to 1939. His works, moderately conservative in style, include the Concert à cinq, for flute, violin, viola, cello, and harp (1923); the Harp Concerto (1944); songs, string quartets, and piano trios.
