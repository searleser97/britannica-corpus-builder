Robert McFerrin, Sr.,  (born March 19, 1921, Marianna, Ark., U.S.—died Nov. 24, 2006, St. Louis, Mo.), American opera singer who became the first African American male to solo at the Metropolitan Opera (Met) when he made his 1955 debut as Amonasro in Giuseppe Verdi’s Aida. His performance came just three weeks after contralto Marian Anderson became the first African American to perform a principal role at the Met.
McFerrin, whose Baptist minister father did not allow him to sing anything but gospel music, was encouraged by a teacher in St. Louis to develop his baritone voice and pursue his talent. He performed in 10 operas in three seasons at the Met and provided the vocals for Sidney Poitier in the film Porgy and Bess (1959). He was also a notable influence on his son, the Grammy Award-winning conductor-vocalist Bobby McFerrin, Jr., with whom he sometimes performed. Although he suffered a severe stroke in 1989, McFerrin, Sr., continued to perform, appearing in concert with his son and the St. Louis Symphony in 1993.
