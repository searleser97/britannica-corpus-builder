Sibyl Swift Sanderson,  (born Dec. 7, 1865, Sacramento, Calif., U.S.—died May 15, 1903, Paris, France),  American-born opera singer whose native country failed to yield her the considerable appreciation she found in continental Europe.
Sanderson early showed remarkable vocal talent, and in 1881, at the age of 15, she was taken to Paris to study singing. After two years she returned home, but she returned to Paris in 1885 and early the next year entered the Paris Conservatory. She made her operatic debut in 1888 under the name Ada Palmer, singing the title role of Jules Massenet’s Manon at the Hague. She had by that time captivated Massenet with her beauty and voice, and he wrote Esclarmonde for her to exploit her remarkable three-octave range. She made her Paris debut in that opera in 1889. In 1891 she introduced Massenet’s Le Mage, which he had likewise written for her, at the Paris Opéra; in 1893 she created the title role in Phryné, which Camille Saint-Saëns had written for her; and in 1894 she sang in the premiere of Massenet’s highly successful Thaïs, also written for her.
Sanderson’s success on the European continent eluded her elsewhere. Her London debut in Manon at Covent Garden in 1891 earned a mixed reception. Her debut in Manon at the Metropolitan Opera of New York in 1895 was not successful. American audiences found her voice small and her acting cold. She repeated her earlier European triumphs in Milan, however, singing Manon and Phryné in 1896. In 1897 she married Antonio Terry and retired from the stage. After his death a year later and a lengthy legal wrangle over his will, she resumed singing, scoring another great success in the premiere of Reynaldo Hahn’s La Carmélite in 1902. Before her planned marriage to Count Paul Tolstoy could take place, she fell ill and died.
