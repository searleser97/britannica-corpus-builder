Sir Eugene Goossens,  (born May 26, 1893, London—died  June 13, 1962, Hillingdon, Middlesex, Eng.), prominent English conductor of the 20th century and a skilled composer.
His father, Eugène Goossens (1867–1958), and his grandfather, Eugène Goossens (1845–1906), were both noted conductors. He studied at the Bruges Conservatory in Belgium, at the Liverpool College of Music, and at the Royal College of Music in London.
In 1921, after several years of association with Sir Thomas Beecham, he formed an orchestra that gave a series of concerts and performed one of his compositions. He was director of the Rochester (N.Y.) Philharmonic Orchestra (1923–31), director of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (1931–46), and resident conductor of the Sydney (New South Wales, Australia) Symphony Orchestra and director of the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music (1947–56). He was knighted in 1955.
His early compositions were influenced by impressionism. Later he developed a polyphonic style at times utilizing impressionistic harmonies but at times becoming highly chromatic, almost atonal. His chamber music includes the Suite for Flute, Violin, and Harp (1914) and the Pastoral and Harlequinade for Flute, Oboe, and Piano (1924). He composed two operas, Judith (produced 1929) and Don Juan de Mañara (1937); a ballet, L’École en crinoline (1921); two symphonies; songs; and pieces for piano, cello, and violin. He also wrote a book, Overture and Beginners (1951).
