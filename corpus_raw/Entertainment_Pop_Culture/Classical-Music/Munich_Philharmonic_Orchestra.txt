Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, German Münchner Philharmoniker,  German symphony orchestra, based in Munich. Founded in 1893 by Franz Kaim, the Kaim Orchestra, as it initially was known, became the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra (MPO) during Siegmund von Hausegger’s tenure (1920–38) as music director. The municipal government of Munich administered and subsidized the orchestra, with additional funds coming from private and, later, corporate subscribers.
The orchestra’s music directors have included, among others, Felix Weingartner (1895–1905), Hans Pfitzner (1919–20), Fritz Rieger (1949–66), Sergiu Celibidache (1979–98), James Levine (1999–2004), Christian Thielemann (2004–11), and Lorin Maazel (2012–14). Valery Gergiev assumed the post of music director in 2015. Wilhelm Furtwängler and Bruno Walter have been among the orchestra’s notable guest conductors.
The MPO established an Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler tradition and premiered works by both composers. Mahler conducted the orchestra in the premieres of his fourth and eighth symphonies. The MPO also has been celebrated for its interpretations of Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, and Richard Wagner. Under Rudolf Kempe, the MPO recorded the complete cycles of Beethoven and Johannes Brahms symphonies. The orchestra has played numerous world tours, sometimes accompanying German governmental officials on their international visits.
