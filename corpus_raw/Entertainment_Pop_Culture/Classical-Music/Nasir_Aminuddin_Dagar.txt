Nasir Aminuddin Dagar,  (born October 20, 1923, Indore, British India [now in Madhya Pradesh, India]—died December 28, 2000, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), Indian singer, exponent of the dhrupad tradition, a spiritual and intensely demanding form of Hindustani vocal music, involving gesture as well as sound. He and his brothers, who were also dhrupad singers, were believed to be the 19th generation of singers—dating to the 18th century—in the Dagar family.
Nasir Aminuddin Dagar was the younger of the famed Senior Dagar Brothers. He and his elder brother, Nasir Moinuddin Dagar (1921–66), were trained in the dhrupad tradition by their father, Nasiruddin Khan, who was singer in the court of the 
Holkar maharaja of Indore. Both his older brother and singing partner and his two younger brothers, Nasir Zahiruddin Dagar (1933–94) and Nasir Faiyazuddin Dagar (1934–89), also singers, predeceased him. Together with his brothers and their descendants, Dagar was responsible for bringing this nonpopulist music to the attention of a wider audience. In later life Dagar lived in Calcutta (now Kolkata), where his ashram attracted many students and music lovers. He was the subject of a documentary film portrait called The Recluse, and he was honoured with the Sangeet Natak Akademi (India’s national academy of music, dance, and drama) award in 1985.
