In 1964 Caballé made a sensational debut in Mexico City in Jules Massenet’s Manon. In the following year she gave a highly successful concert performance of Gaetano Donizetti’s Lucrezia Borgia at Carnegie Hall in New York City, sang the parts of the Countess in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Le nozze di Figaro and the Marschallin in Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier at the Glyndebourne Festival in East Sussex, and made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City as Marguerite in Charles Gounod’s Faust. She performed in leading opera houses of the world and gave many recitals, most notably of Spanish songs.
