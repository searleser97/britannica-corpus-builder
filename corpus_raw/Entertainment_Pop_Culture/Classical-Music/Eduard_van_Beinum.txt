Eduard van Beinum, in full Eduard Alexander van Beinum,  (born Sept. 3, 1901, Arnhem, Neth.—died April 13, 1959, Amsterdam), Dutch conductor, pianist, and violist who led orchestras in Europe and the United States.
At 17 van Beinum entered the Amsterdam Conservatory after a year of playing in the string section of the Arnhem Philharmonic Orchestra. A series of minor appointments led to conductorships of the Haarlem Orchestra and Haarlem Roman Catholic Choir, posts that he held until 1931, the year he was made second conductor of the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra. In 1938 he was promoted to co-first conductor, sharing the position with Bruno Walter. When musical activity resumed after the Netherlands’ liberation in 1944, he took over as that organization’s conductor-in-chief, which he remained until his death. He also began touring extensively. He led the London Philharmonic from 1949 to 1951, encouraging and promoting the composer and first trumpet player Malcolm Arnold. Van Beinum’s American debut occurred in 1954 with the Philadelphia Orchestra, followed by a U.S. tour with the Concertgebouw Orchestra. In 1956 he was named musical director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
Van Beinum conducted with economy, without using a baton or much gesticulation. Though conventional in his programming, his reputation was based on intelligent, uneccentric interpretations that paid careful attention to the score.
