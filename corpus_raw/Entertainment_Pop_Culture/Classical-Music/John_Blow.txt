John Blow,  (baptized Feb. 23, 1649, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, Eng.—died Oct. 1, 1708, Westminster, London), organist and composer, remembered for his church music and for Venus and Adonis, which is regarded as the earliest surviving English opera.
He was probably educated at the Magnus Song School in Nottinghamshire and in 1660 became a chorister at the Chapel Royal. He was appointed organist of Westminster Abbey (1668), and in 1669 he became one of the king’s musicians for virginals. In March 1674 he was sworn in as a gentleman of the Chapel Royal and became master of the children, a position he held until his death. He had great influence on the choristers under him and also on his student, Henry Purcell. In 1676 or 1677 he became one of the Chapel Royal organists, and in 1677 the dean and chapter of Canterbury conferred on him a doctorate of music—the first instance of what became known as a Lambeth Degree in music.
In 1679 Blow was succeeded as organist at Westminster Abbey by Purcell; he was reappointed after Purcell’s death in 1695. The years 1680–1700 were the most productive and prosperous of his life. In 1687 he became master of the children of St. Paul’s, a position he held for 16 years; and in 1699 he received his last appointment, as first composer to the Chapel Royal.
Blow’s official positions entailed the writing of much religious and secular ceremonial music. At least 10 services and more than 100 anthems are extant, and many remain in regular use. He was at his best in the writing of full anthems in a simple chordal or contrapuntal style with melodies of great strength and sweetness developed over a ground bass. He excelled also in the writing of services; outstanding is his Service in G Major. His Venus and Adonis, written between 1680 and 1685 for performance at court and called by him A Masque for the Entertainment of the King, was important in the development of English opera. It is the first surviving dramatic work with English text in which the whole text is set to music without either spoken dialogue or extraneous musical entertainment. His songs for one, two, three, and four voices, which appear in many contemporary collections and in his own Amphion Anglicus (1700), are notable for their charm of melody.
