Joseph Rheinberger, in full Joseph Gabriel Rheinberger,  (born March 17, 1839, Vaduz, Liechtenstein—died  Nov. 25, 1901, Munich, Ger.), German composer and teacher whose organ sonatas are among the finest 19th-century works for that instrument.
Rheinberger studied organ at Vaduz and became organist at the parish church when he was only seven years old. He later studied at Feldkirch and Munich and in 1867 became professor of organ and composition at the Munich Conservatory. Among his pupils were Engelbert Humperdinck, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari, Wilhelm Furtwängler, and the American composers George W. Chadwick and Horatio Parker. Besides 20 organ sonatas, he wrote four operas and much church and chamber music. He received a title of nobility in 1894.
