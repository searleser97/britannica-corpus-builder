Jessye Norman,  (born September 15, 1945, Augusta, Georgia, U.S.—died September 30, 2019, New York, New York), American operaticsoprano, one of the finest of her day, who also enjoyed a successful concert career.
Norman was reared in a musical family. Both her mother and grandmother were pianists and her father sang in church, as did the young Jessye. She won a scholarship to Howard University in Washington, D.C., where she studied voice. She graduated in 1967 and received further training at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, Maryland, and at the University of Michigan.
After winning the Bavarian Radio Corp. International Music Competition in 1968, Norman made her operatic debut as Elisabeth in Richard Wagner’s Tannhäuser in 1969 in Berlin. The beauty, range, and flexibility of Norman’s vibrant soprano voice assured her further operatic engagements, the most notable being the title role in Aïda in productions in Berlin and at La Scala in Milan and the role of Cassandra in Hector Berlioz’s Les Troyens (The Trojans; Covent Garden, 1972). In 1989 she appeared at the Metropolitan Opera for a historic performance of that company’s first single-character production, Erwartung by Arnold Schoenberg.
Norman enjoyed success as a recitalist with her thorough scholarship and her ability to project drama through her voice. She toured throughout the 1970s, giving recitals of works by Franz Schubert, Gustav Mahler, Wagner, Johannes Brahms, Erik Satie, Olivier Messiaen, and several contemporary American composers. By the mid-1980s she was one of the most popular and highly regarded dramatic soprano singers in the world. She produced numerous award-winning recordings, and many of her performances were televised.
