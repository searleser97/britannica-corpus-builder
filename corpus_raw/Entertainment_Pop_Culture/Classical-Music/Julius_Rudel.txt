Julius Rudel,  (born March 6, 1921, Vienna, Austria—died June 26, 2014), Austrian-born American conductor and opera impresario who was conductor or director of the New York City Opera, 1944–79.
Rudel attended the Vienna Academy of Music and, after immigrating to the United States in 1938, studied at the Mannes School of Music in New York. In 1943 he joined the New York City Opera, working as a rehearsal pianist, coach, and (after 1944) conductor. He also directed the Third Street Music School (1945–52) and acted as music director of the New York City Light Opera. From 1957 to 1979, he served as director of the New York City Opera where his success as an administrator matched his distinction as a conductor. Rudel instilled the spirit of ensemble opera in the company, which, during those years, offered an adventurous repertory; noteworthy were its premieres of American operas by Carlisle Floyd, Robert Ward, Douglas Moore, and Hugo Weisgall. Rudel achieved a memorable success with Cole Porter’s Kiss Me, Kate at the Vienna Volksoper in 1956. He was the first music director of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. (1971–74). From 1979 to 1985 he was music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra.
