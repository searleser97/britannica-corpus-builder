Lucine Amara, original name Lucine Tockqui Armaganian,  (born March 1, 1927, Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.), American operatic soprano, prima donna of the Metropolitan Opera (Met) in New York. She was regarded as one of the finest lyric sopranos of her generation.
Amara studied singing in San Francisco, where she sang in the chorus of the San Francisco Opera (1945–46) and made her concert debut at the War Memorial Opera House (c. 1946). She continued her studies at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, California (1947), and won a contest leading to an appearance at the Hollywood Bowl (1948). She spent the next two years as a student at the University of Southern California and as a soloist for the San Francisco Symphony.
Following her Metropolitan Opera debut (1950) as the Celestial Voice in Don Carlos, Amara sang with the group in nearly 900 performances, more than 60 of which were broadcast on radio and television. Among her many leading lyric and dramatic roles, she regularly appeared as Micaëla (Carmen), Cio-Cio-San (Madame Butterfly), and Tatiana (Eugene Onegin). She also performed in Europe, Asia, and South America, and her clear, cool voice was recorded in productions including I Pagliacci and La Bohème.
Amara retired from the Met in 1991. In 1995 she became artistic director of the New Jersey Association of Verismo Opera; she held the post for some 25 years. In 1989 she was inducted into the Academy of Vocal Arts Hall of Fame.
