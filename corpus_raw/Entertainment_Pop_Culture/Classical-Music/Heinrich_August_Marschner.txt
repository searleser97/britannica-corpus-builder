Heinrich August Marschner,  (born Aug. 16, 1795, Zittau, Saxony—died  Dec. 14, 1861, Hannover, Hanover), composer who helped establish the style of German Romantic opera.
Marschner studied law at Leipzig, but, encouraged by Ludwig van Beethoven, whom he met in Vienna in 1817, and others, he turned to composing. In 1820 his close friend Carl Maria von Weber produced Marschner’s opera Heinrich IV und d’Aubigné at Dresden. Marschner was later appointed director of the Dresden opera. In 1827 he became Kapellmeister of the Leipzig City Theatre, where he produced his operas Der Vampyr (1828) and Templer und Jüdin (1829; libretto after Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe). In 1831 he became court Kapellmeister at Hannover. His most successful opera, Hans Heiling, was produced in Berlin in 1833; it remains in the operatic repertory in Germany. He produced five further operas, but none of them achieved the success of his earlier works. Stylistically, Marschner exhibits both the musical flavour and the interest in the supernatural of Weber and the early Romantics and the expanded 19th-century orchestration with its wider emotional range that was to characterize the works of Richard Wagner.
