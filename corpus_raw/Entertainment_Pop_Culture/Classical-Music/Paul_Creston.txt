Paul Creston, original name Giuseppe Guttoveggio,  (born Oct. 10, 1906, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Aug. 24, 1985, San Diego, Calif.), American composer noted for the rhythmic vitality and full harmonies of his music, which is marked by modern dissonances and polyrhythms.
Creston studied piano and organ and in 1934 became organist at St. Malachy’s Church, New York City. He had no formal training in music theory, teaching himself composition by studying musical scores and by reading. After leaving St. Malachy’s in 1967, he taught at Central Washington State College until his retirement in 1975. He was also active as a conductor and lecturer.
Creston gained prominence with his Threnody (1938) and Two Choric Dances (1938), both for orchestra. His symphonies, some with programmatic connotations, include the Third Symphony (1950) and the Lancaster Symphony (1970). His Corinthians XIII (1963), like the Third Symphony, uses themes from Gregorian chant. His belief that song and dance are the basis of music is reflected in the Invocation and Dance for orchestra (1953), in the two-part Janus for Strings, Piano, and Percussion (1959), and in the two-movement Second Symphony (1945). His other works include the symphonic poem Walt Whitman (1951); Pavane Variations (1966), comprising variations on four 12-tone rows; Rapsodie for saxophone and organ (1976); a concertino for marimba; concerti for saxophone, for piano, and for violin; solo piano pieces; and sacred vocal works.
