Burgundian school,   dominant musical style of Europe during most of the 15th century, when the prosperous and powerful dukes of Burgundy, particularly Philip the Good and Charles the Bold, maintained large chapels of musicians, including composers, singers, and instrumentalists. Among the chapel members in the 15th century were Nicolas Grenon, Jacques Vide, Gilles Binchois, Pierre Fontaine, Robert Morton, Hayne van Ghizeghem, and Antoine Busnois. Although Guillaume Dufay (q.v.), the most illustrious Burgundian composer, was probably never a regular member of the chapel, he was associated with the ducal court at Dijon as a musician and chaplain.
Despite Dufay’s developments in the mass as a musical genre, the polyphonic chanson, or secular song, is the most characteristic expression of the Burgundian school. Its clear musical structure is based on the stanza patterns of the ballade, rondeau, and virelai, written in the traditional fixed forms of French poetry. Early in the 15th century, composers shifted their attention from the intricate and lengthy ballade to the simpler and more concise rondeau. This shift reflects the general tendency toward greater simplicity, brevity, and naturalness in the Burgundian chanson. Typically, the chanson is dominated by the vocal top part, in which the melodic interest is greatest. Of the two lower parts, the instrumental tenor is the most important, for it provides the main harmonic support for the soprano. Gilles Binchois (c. 1400–60) was the consummate master of the chanson; he composed more than 50 examples, most of them rondeaux.
