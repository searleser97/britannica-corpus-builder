Victor Maurel,  (born June 17, 1848, Marseille, France—died  Oct. 22, 1923, New York, N.Y., U.S.), French operatic baritone and outstanding singing actor, admired for his breath control and dramatic artistry.
Maurel studied voice at the School of Music in Marseille then continued at the Paris Conservatoire, where in 1867 he won first prize. In the following year he made his debut at the Paris Opéra as the Count de Nevers in Giacomo Meyerbeer’s Les Huguenots, and thereafter he appeared at La Scala, Milan, in the premiere of Antonio Carlos Gomes’ Il Guarany and at Covent Garden, London, in English premieres of Richard Wagner’s Lohengrin, Tannhäuser, and The Flying Dutchman.
In 1873 Maurel made his U.S. debut in the American premiere of Giuseppe Verdi’s Aida in New York City. He then withdrew from the stage before rejoining the Paris Opéra in 1879, where he remained one of its reigning baritones for 15 years. Maurel’s most memorable achievements were as Iago and Falstaff in the respective world premieres of Verdi’s Otello (1887) and Falstaff (1893). He sang at the Metropolitan Opera in 1894 and again in 1899. After an attempt at legitimate acting he returned to the operatic stage in 1904, but five years later retired to New York City to become a singing teacher.
Maurel was the author of several books on singing and staging operas as well as an autobiography, Dix Ans de carrière (1897).
