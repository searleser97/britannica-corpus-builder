Vladimir Ashkenazy, in full Vladimir Davidovich Ashkenazy,  (born July 6, 1937, Gorky, Russia, U.S.S.R. [now Nizhny Novgorod, Russia]), Russian-born Icelandic pianist and conductor whose extensive piano repertoire included works by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, and Sergey Rachmaninoff.
Both of Ashkenazy’s parents were professional pianists. Beginning piano lessons at age six, Ashkenazy studied for 10 years at the Moscow Central School of Music and entered the Moscow Conservatory in 1955. He attained international prominence when he won the gold medal at the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium International Competition in Brussels in 1956; he also shared first prize at the second Tchaikovsky Competition in 1962. In 1963 he emigrated to the West, assuming Icelandic citizenship in 1972.
In the mid-1970s Ashkenazy became active as a conductor. He was noted for his ability to communicate with both orchestra and audience. From 1987 to 1994 he was music director of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (in London), and in 1989 he was named music director of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (renamed as German Symphony Orchestra in 1994). Ashkenazy later served as chief conductor of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra (1998–2003) and of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra (2009–13). In 2020 it was announced that he would no longer perform in public.
