Shobha Gurtu, original name Bhanumati Shirodkar,  (born February 8, 1925, Belgaum, India—died September 27, 2004, Mumbai), renowned singer of Indian classical music. Known for her rich earthy voice, distinctive vocal style, and mastery of various song genres, she was considered the “queen of thumri,” a light classical Hindustani style.
Her mother, Menakabai Shirodkar, who was a professional dancer and a traditionally trained singer, gave Gurtu her initial instruction. She took the name Shoba Gurtu after her marriage to Vishwanath Gurtu, the son of sitar player and scholar Narayan Nath Gurtu (who also came to influence her style). Although trained in the classical khayal form, she became more interested in light classical genres; besides thumri, she also excelled in dadras, ghazals, and other forms.
Gurtu recorded extensively and performed throughout India. She was also a popular broadcaster and television entertainer, and she created the musical scores for several Marathi- and Hindi-language movies and sang on a number of film sound tracks. Gurtu performed as a guest on three albums recorded by her youngest son, percussionist Trilok Gurtu. She received several honours, including the 1987 Sangeet Natak Akademi (National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama) award for vocal music and in 2002 the Padma Bhushan—one of the Indian government’s highest civilian awards—for her contributions to the arts.
