Rudolph Ganz,  (born February 24, 1877, Zürich, Switzerland—died August 2, 1972, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.), Swiss-born pianist, conductor, and composer who introduced works by contemporary composers such as Bartók, Ravel, and Vincent d’Indy and who revived little-played older works in the keyboard repertory.
Ganz performed as a cellist at age 10 and as a pianist at 12. After study at the conservatories in Zürich, Lausanne, and Strasbourg, he studied piano in Berlin under the composer and piano virtuoso Ferruccio Busoni. He made his official debut in 1899 with the Berlin Philharmonic. He directed the piano department of Chicago Musical College (now part of Roosevelt University) from 1900 to 1905 and became vice president in 1927, president in 1933, and president emeritus in 1954. He conducted the St. Louis Symphony (1921–27) and the New York Philharmonic Young People’s concerts (1938–49). His compositions include a symphony, works for piano and voice, and more than 200 songs.
