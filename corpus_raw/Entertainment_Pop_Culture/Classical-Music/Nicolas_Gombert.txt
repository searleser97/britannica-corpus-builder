Nicolas Gombert,  (born c. 1490, southern Flanders [now in Belgium]â€”died c. 1556, Tournai, Flanders), one of the leading Flemish composers of the Renaissance, whose work forms a link between that of the two masters Josquin des Prez and Palestrina.
Gombert traveled widely as a singer and master of the choirboys in the Chapel Royal of Charles V and later held positions at the cathedrals of Courtrai and Tournai. Gombert, like Josquin, developed techniques of melodic imitation, but Gombert used a freer, less symmetrical style. His compositions are smooth and even in texture, with less dramatic feeling than those of Josquin. His musical textures and his unobtrusive handling of dissonance point to the later style of Palestrina. His chansons are admired for their fresh, straightforward quality.
Gombert was viewed by his colleagues as an innovator. In his travels he was influential in spreading the Franco-Netherlandish style that became the international musical style of the Renaissance. His works include about 160 motets, about 60 chansons, 10 masses, and 8 Magnificats.
