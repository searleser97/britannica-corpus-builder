Orchestre de la Suisse Romande,  symphony orchestra based in Geneva and founded in 1918 by Ernest Ansermet to provide the French-speaking section of Switzerland (the Suisse Romande) with a permanent symphony orchestra. Ansermet was music director and chief conductor of the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande (OSR) for 50 years. Other music directors included Paul Kletzki (1967–70), Wolfgang Sawallisch (1970–80), Horst Stein (1980–85), Armin Jordan (1985–97), Fabio Luisi (1997–2002), Pinchas Steinberg (2002–05), Marek Janowski (2005–12), and Neeme Järvi (2012–15). Jonathan Nott came to the podium as music and artistic director in 2017.
From its early years, the OSR has offered symphony concerts in Geneva and Lausanne as well as in the smaller cities of the Suisse Romande, has broadcast its performances on national media networks, and has served as the orchestra for Geneva’s opera company, the Grand Théâtre de Genève, while keeping a busy schedule of international performance engagements. The orchestra has recorded most of the important symphonic works of French composers Maurice Ravel, César Franck, and Claude Debussy and has won numerous prestigious honours for these and other recordings. The OSR also regularly commissions and performs new works by contemporary composers.
