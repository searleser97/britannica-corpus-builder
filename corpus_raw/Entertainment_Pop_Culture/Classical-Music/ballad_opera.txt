Ballad opera,  characteristic English type of comic opera, originating in the 18th century and featuring farcical or extravaganza plots. The music was mainly confined to songs interspersed in spoken dialogue. Such operas at first used ballads or folk songs to which new words were adapted; later, tunes were borrowed from popular operas, or music was occasionally newly composed.
One of the earliest and the most famous of ballad operas is The Beggar’s Opera (1728), which is at once a spoof on Italian serious opera and a satire on the morality of contemporary politicians. Its text is by John Gay, with music adapted by John Pepusch. It had many imitators. Other composers adapting or writing music for ballad operas included Thomas Arne, Charles Dibdin, Stephen Storace, and, in the 19th century, Sir Henry Bishop.
The ballad opera can be seen as a precursor to the light opera of W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan and, indirectly through musical comedy, into the modern musical. It also influenced the evolution of the similar German Singspiel in the 18th century. Several early ballad operas were successfully revived in the 20th century. Modern works directly influenced by the ballad opera include Ralph Vaughan Williams’s opera Hugh the Drover.
