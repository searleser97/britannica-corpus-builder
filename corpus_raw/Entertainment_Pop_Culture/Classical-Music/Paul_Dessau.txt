Paul Dessau,  (born Dec. 19, 1894, Hamburg, Ger.—died  June 28, 1979, East Berlin, E.Ger. [now Berlin, Ger.]), German composer and conductor best known for his operas and other vocal works written in collaboration with Bertolt Brecht. Dessau’s conducting career included posts in Cologne (1919–23) and Berlin (1925–33). His long collaboration with Brecht began in 1942 in the United States, where he wrote the music (1946) for Brecht’s play Mutter Courage und ihre Kinder (Mother Courage and Her Children), the most popular of the Brecht-Dessau works. From 1948, they continued their partnership in East Germany, where Dessau composed his most successful opera, Die Verurteilung des Lukullus (1949; “The Sentencing of Lucullus”; also called Das Verhör des Lukullus [“The Trial of Lucullus”]), with libretto by Brecht. Dessau’s other works include the opera Einstein (1971–73).
