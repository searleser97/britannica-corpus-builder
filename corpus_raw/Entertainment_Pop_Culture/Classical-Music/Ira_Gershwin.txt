Ira Gershwin, original name Israel Gershvin,  (born Dec. 6, 1896, Manhattan, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died  Aug. 17, 1983, Beverly Hills, Calif.), American lyricist who collaborated with his younger brother, George Gershwin, on more than 20 Broadway musicals and motion pictures until George’s death (1937) and who later collaborated on films and plays with others—Moss Hart, Kurt Weill, Jerome Kern, Harry Warren, and Harold Arlen—and contributed to Gershwin revivals.
Gershwin was born on New York’s Lower East Side of Russian-Jewish immigrant parents. He early showed literary talent and attended City College of New York for two years (1914–16). Thereafter, he did odd jobs until his brother, already becoming known as a composer and musician, asked him to write lyrics; their first song of collaboration was “The Real American Folk Song,” which appeared in Ladies First (1918). During the early years, Ira Gershwin used a pseudonym, Arthur Francis, in order not to capitalize on his brother’s reputation.
Over the years he wrote many brilliant lyrics for such Gershwin songs as “The Man I Love,” “’S Wonderful,” “I Got Rhythm,” “Embraceable You,” “A Foggy Day,” and “Fascinating Rhythm” and prepared the lyrics for Porgy and Bess (1935), with such songs as “Summertime,” “I Got Plenty o’ Nuttin’,” and “It Ain’t Necessarily So.” His later credits include “My Ship” with Kurt Weill (1940), “Long Ago and Far Away” with Jerome Kern (1944), and “The Man That Got Away” with Harold Arlen (1954), written for Judy Garland. He collected all the lyrics of his best-known songs and wrote commentaries on each in Lyrics on Several Occasions (1959). Ira Gershwin continued writing until the last year of his life, rewriting lyrics for Gershwin tunes used in the musical My One and Only (1983).
