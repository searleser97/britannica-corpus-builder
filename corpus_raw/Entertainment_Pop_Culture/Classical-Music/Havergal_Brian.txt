Havergal Brian, in full William Havergal Brian,  (born Jan. 29, 1876, Dresden, Staffordshire, Eng.—died  Nov. 28, 1972, Shoreham, Sussex), English musician and self-taught composer.
In his youth Brian played the violin, organ, piano, and cello. His chief love, however, came to be composition. Between the ages of 20 and 45, he wrote more than 100 songs and some dozen orchestral works, in addition to two cantatas and an opera, The Tigers (begun in 1916), considered a remarkably pointed satire on war.
Between World Wars I and II, Brian was a music journalist. Performances of his music were infrequent from 1922 until the 1960s, when a growing audience for his work developed. By then he had completed the vast lyric drama Prometheus Unbound, two concerti, four more operas, and 13 symphonies. His most famous work, Gothic Symphony (1919–27; first performance 1961), requires an orchestra of 200 performers and choirs of 400 to 600. Between 1959 and 1968—i.e., between the ages of 83 and 92—Brian wrote 20 more symphonies, bringing the total to 33.
