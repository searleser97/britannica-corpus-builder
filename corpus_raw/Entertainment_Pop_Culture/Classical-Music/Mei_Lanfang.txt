Mei Lanfang, Wade-Giles romanization Mei Lan-fang,  (born October 22, 1894, Beijing, China—died August 8, 1961, Beijing), Chinese theatrical performer, one of the greatest singer-actor-dancers in Chinese history.
The son and grandson of noted opera singers, Mei began studying jingxi at the Peking Opera at age 8 and made his stage debut at 11, playing a weaving girl. Thereafter he played mostly female roles, becoming especially known for his portrayal of the “Flower-Shattering Diva”; his style of dance won such acclaim over the years that it came to be known as the “Mei Lanfang school.” At age 13 he joined the Xiliancheng Theatrical Company and, through performances in Shanghai and elsewhere, acquired a national reputation. He toured Japan in 1919 and 1924, the United States in 1930, and the Soviet Union in 1932 and 1935.
After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he settled in Hong Kong (1937), but he returned to Shanghai following the Japanese seizure of the territory and withdrew from the theatre for five years, resuming his career only in 1946. Thereafter he did both stage and film work and served as director or member of several cultural organizations. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1959.
Some of his most famous roles are Bai Niangzi in Duanqiao (“Broken Bridge”), Lin Daiyu in Daiyu zanghua (“Daiyu Buries Flowers”), Yuji in Bawang bieji (“Farewell My Concubine”), and Yang Yuhuan in Guifei zuijiu (“Concubine Gets Drunk”).
