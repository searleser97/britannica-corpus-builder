Robert Kajanus,  (born Dec. 2, 1856, Helsingfors, Finland, Russian Empire [now Helsinki, Fin.]—died  July 6, 1933, Helsinki), Finnish conductor and composer who championed Finnish national music.
Kajanus studied music in Helsinki, Leipzig, and Paris. In 1882 he founded the Helsinki Orchestral Society, the first complete symphony orchestra in Finland; in 1914 it united with the state’s symphony orchestra. He remained its conductor until 1932 and became known as the authoritative interpreter of the works of his friend Jean Sibelius. Kajanus also founded choral and orchestral schools. His compositions, influenced by the German Romantic composers and by Finnish folk music, include two symphonic works—Kullervo (1881) and Aino (1885), based on the Kalevala—and two Finnish rhapsodies for orchestra, in addition to a number of cantatas, piano works, and songs.
