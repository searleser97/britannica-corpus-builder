Allan Pettersson, in full Gustaf Allan Pettersson,  (born September 19, 1911, Uppsala, Sweden—died June 20, 1980, Stockholm), Swedish composer known as the creator of Barfotasånger (“Barefoot Songs”), a collection of 24 songs for voice and piano set to his own lyrics. He also wrote 16 symphonies, choral and chamber music, and a number of orchestral pieces.
Himself the son of a poor blacksmith, Pettersson early learned to play the violin and the viola. He was accepted into the Swedish Royal Academy of Music at age 19. He studied under Karl-Birger Blomdahl during World War II and later in Paris with Arthur Honegger and René Leibowitz. During the two decades following his return (1953) to Sweden, he produced 15 symphonies; his first symphony was composed in 1950–51. Pettersson’s first composition, a sonata for piano and violin, was completed in 1943, and his last, a concerto written for violinist Ida Haendel, was premiered in Stockholm in 1980. Pettersson was appointed to the board of the Royal Academy of Music in 1970 and in 1979 received the title of professor.
