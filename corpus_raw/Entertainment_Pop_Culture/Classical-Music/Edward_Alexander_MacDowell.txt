Edward MacDowell,  (born Dec. 18, 1860, New York City—died  Jan. 23, 1908, New York City), U.S. composer known especially for his piano pieces in smaller forms. As one of the first to incorporate native materials into his works, he helped establish an independent American musical idiom.
MacDowell first studied in New York with Teresa Carreño and then at the Conservatoire (1876–78) in Paris. In 1878 he went to Germany to study composition with Joachim Raff at the Frankfurt Conservatory and later taught piano at Darmstadt. In 1882 Raff introduced MacDowell to Liszt, who arranged for him to play his Modern Suite No. 1 at Zürich. In 1884 he went to the U.S., where he married his former pupil, Marian Nevins (1857–1956). He returned with her to Wiesbaden and remained there until 1887. The following year he settled in the U.S. In 1889 he played in New York City the first performance of his Second Piano Concerto in D Minor, his most successful larger work, one that retains popularity throughout the world.
In 1896 he was invited to establish a department of music at Columbia University, New York City. As a result of disagreement with the university, he resigned in 1904, becoming the subject of much unpleasant publicity, which may have contributed to his mental collapse. He eventually receded to infantilism from which he never recovered. A public appeal for funds was made on his behalf in 1906. Shortly before his death, his wife organized the MacDowell Colony at their residence in Peterborough, N.H., as a permanent institution in the form of a summer residence for American composers and writers.
MacDowell’s music is said to derive from the contemporary Romantic movements in Europe, his lyrical style suggesting Grieg, his harmony, Schumann and sometimes Liszt. Almost all his works have literary or pictorial associations. His early symphonic poems include Hamlet and Ophelia (1885), Lancelot and Elaine (1888), Lamia (1889), and The Saracens (1891). More distinctive is his orchestral Indian Suite (1892), based on Indian tunes. His songs, though derivative, are lyrical; but he is considered at his best in his piano music, particularly in small pieces, when he shows the gifts of a sensitive miniaturist. The best of his piano works are thought to be the suites Sea Pieces (1898) and Fireside Tales (1902) and the imaginative evocations of the American scene in the albums Woodland Sketches (1896) and New England Idylls (1902). His four piano sonatas, Tragica (1893), Eroica (1895), Norse (1900), and Keltic (1901), are cited as ambitious attempts at programmatic music in classical forms.
