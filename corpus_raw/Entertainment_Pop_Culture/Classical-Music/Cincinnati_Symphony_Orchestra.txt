Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra,  American symphony orchestra based in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was founded in 1895 by the all-female board of trustees of the Cincinnati Orchestra Association, headed by Helen Herron Taft, wife of future U.S. president William Howard Taft. The fifth oldest symphony orchestra in the United States, the Cincinnati Symphony maintains a year-round performing schedule, including subscription concerts, Pops Concerts, Young People’s Concerts, and Lollipop Family Concerts.
Music directors have been Frank van der Stucken (1895–1907), Leopold Stokowski (1909–12), Ernst Kunwald (1912–18), Eugène Ysaÿe (1918–22), Fritz Reiner (1922–31), Eugene Goossens (1931–47), Thor Johnson (1947–58), Max Rudolf (1958–70), Thomas Schippers (1970–77), Michael Gielen (1980–86), Jesús López-Cobos (1986–2001), Paavo Järvi (2001–11), and Louis Langrée (2013– ). Resident conductors have included Erich Kunzel (1969–70) and Carmon DeLeone (1977–78). Walter Susskind was music adviser from 1978 to 1980. Under Reiner’s tenure, with its emphasis on the central European repertoire, the orchestra achieved an international reputation for excellence.
The Cincinnati Symphony has toured widely in the United States and Europe. In 1966, under the sponsorship of the U.S. Department of State and the direction of Max Rudolf, it was the first American orchestra to make a world tour. The orchestra’s primary home is the Music Hall; it also performs at the Riverbend Music Center, an outdoor venue. The Cincinnati Symphony is the official orchestra of the annual Cincinnati May Festival, the second oldest music festival in the United States, and of the Cincinnati Opera and the Cincinnati Ballet. The Cincinnati Pops Orchestra was established in 1977 by Erich Kunzel.
