Albert Lortzing, in full Gustav Albert Lortzing,  (born Oct. 23, 1801, Berlin, Prussia [Germany]—died  Jan. 21, 1851, Berlin), composer who established the 19th-century style of light German opera that remained in favour until the mid-20th century.
Lortzing’s parents were actors, and he was largely self-taught as a musician. He produced a one-act vaudeville, Ali Pascha von Janina, in 1828; a play with music, Der Pole und sein Kind (1832; “The Pole and His Child”); and in 1832 wrote (but did not produce) Szenen aus Mozarts Leben (“Scenes of Mozart’s Life”), with music selected from the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From 1833 to 1844 he sang as a tenor in Leipzig. His most successful opera was Zar (originally Czaar) und Zimmermann (1837; “Tsar and Carpenter”), based on an episode from the life of Peter the Great. Other operas include Undine (1845), a romantic opera in the style of Carl Maria von Weber and Heinrich August Marschner, Der Waffenschmied (1846; “The Military Blacksmith”), and Rolands Knappen (1849). His style derives from that of the German Singspiel and from the early 19th-century French opéra comique, which enjoyed a great vogue in Germany.
