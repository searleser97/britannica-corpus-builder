Luisa Tetrazzini,  (born June 29, 1871, Florence, Italy—died April 28, 1940, Milan), Italian coloratura soprano, one of the finest of her time.
In Florence, Tetrazzini studied with her sister Eva, a successful dramatic soprano, and at the conservatory, making her debut in 1895 as Inez in Giacomo Meyerbeer’s opera L’Africaine. After her well-received debut, Tetrazzini sang in Rome and other Italian cities with a success that led to tours as far away as Russia, Mexico, and South America. She first sang at Covent Garden in London in 1907, as Violetta in Giuseppe Verdi’s La traviata. Her New York City debut was at the Manhattan Opera House in 1908, and she sang with the Chicago Opera in 1913–14. The greatest period of her career was before World War I, although she appeared in recitals after the war and taught singing in Milan.
Tetrazzini’s voice was light in quality. Critics held that she was a poor actress, a characteristic shared by most Italian singers of her time. Her vocal technique, however, was stunning and remained so very nearly until her death. She described her career in My Life of Song (1921) and published another book, How to Sing, in 1923. The dish chicken tetrazzini was named in her honour.
