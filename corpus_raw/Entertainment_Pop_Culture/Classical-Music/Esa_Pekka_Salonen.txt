Esa-Pekka Salonen,  (born June 30, 1958, Helsinki, Finland), Finnish composer and conductor who was the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic (1992–2009) and later of the San Francisco Symphony (2020– ). He also served as principal conductor and artistic advisor of the Philharmonia Orchestra (2008– ) in London.
Salonen studied French horn, conducting, and composition at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki (1973–77) and composition with private teachers in Italy (1979–81). In 1979 he made his conducting debut with the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra. He burst onto the international scene in 1983 with his performance of Gustav Mahler’s Third Symphony with the Philharmonia in London. In 1986 an American Grammy Award and a British Gramophone magazine award went to Salonen and the Los Angeles Philharmonic for their recording of Witold Lutosławski’s Symphony No. 3.
Salonen’s dynamic and theatrical approach proved a perfect match for the Los Angeles musicians, and he led the orchestra through 17 years. Particularly rejuvenating was the move in 2003 to the spectacular new Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall. During his time as director, Salonen and the orchestra premiered John Adams’s Naïve and Sentimental Music (1999) as well as several of Salonen’s own compositions, including LA Variations (1997), 1001 Nights (1998), and Wing on Wing (2004).
Like other international star conductors, Salonen worked with many of the world’s most highly regarded orchestras. He was also active in the international music festival circuit and made numerous recordings for the German label Deutsche Grammophon. Salonen’s programming emphasized contemporary music, though he did not ignore the classical repertoire; in 2006 he completed a cycle of Beethoven symphonies. Among the composers he featured were those from the Baltic region, including Estonian Arvo Pärt and Finns Jean Sibelius, Kaija Saariaho, and Magnus Lindberg. Salonen recorded much of Austrian composer György Ligeti’s work, collaborating with the composer until Ligeti’s death in 2006. Of particular interest were Salonen’s collaborations with American stage director Peter Sellars on such productions as The Tristan Project (2004), a multimedia concert presentation of Richard Wagner’s opera Tristan und Isolde; one act was played on each of three successive evenings, and all were accompanied by a video by Bill Viola.
In 2020 Salonen succeeded Michael Tilson Thomas as music director of the San Francisco Symphony.
