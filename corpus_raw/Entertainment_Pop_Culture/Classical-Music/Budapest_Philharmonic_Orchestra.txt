Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra, in Hungarian Budapesti Filharmóniai Társaság Zenekara,  Hungarian symphony orchestra based in Budapest. Members of the National Theatre orchestra began giving Philharmonic Concerts in 1853, in the midst of a period of political repression in Hungary. Ferenc Erkel was the concerts’ initial conductor. He continued as music director until 1871, four years after the Philharmonic Society was established. By then composer Franz Liszt was traveling regularly to Budapest and, among other activities, appearing as guest conductor with the orchestra, and his influence was important in establishing Budapest as an important musical centre.
Later conductors of the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra included Hans Richter (1871–75), Sándor Erkel (1875–1900), and István Kerner (1900–18). Composer-teacher Ernst von Dohnányi became its conductor in 1918 and continued, while fighting Nazi power, until 1943, when he disbanded the orchestra amid the chaos of World War II. The orchestra was rebuilt and grew under János Ferencsik (1960–67), who was succeeded by András Kórodi (1967–86). Subsequent conductors were Erich Bergel (1989–94), Rico Saccani (1997–2005), György Győriványi-Ráth (2011–14), and Pinchas Steinberg (2014– ). The orchestra recorded for the Supraphon, Qualiton, and Hungaroton labels, on occasion under Zoltán Kodály’s direction.
