Two performing arms of the orchestra are the Philharmonic Chamber Music Society and the Philharmonic New Music Group; the orchestra vigorously champions contemporary music. During the winter season, the Philharmonic performs at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center, and, during summers, it performs at the Hollywood Bowl. Since 1997, winter concerts have been held at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, a theatre of the Music Center complex.
In 1992 the Philharmonic was the first American orchestra in residence at the Salzburg (Austria) Festival, presenting operas and symphonic concerts. In 1994 the orchestra toured Europe and Asia.
