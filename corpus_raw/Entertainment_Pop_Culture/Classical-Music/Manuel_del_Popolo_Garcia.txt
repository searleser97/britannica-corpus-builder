Manuel del Popolo García, in full Manuel del Popolo Vicente García,  (born January 22, 1775, Sevilla, Spain—died June 2, 1832, Paris, France), Spanish tenor and composer, one of the finest singers of his time.
At age 17 García made his stage debut at Cádiz, Spain, in an operetta that included songs he had composed. In 1800 the first of his more than 90 operas, El preso, was produced in Madrid. García was active as a singer and composer in Paris (1808–11) and Italy (1811–16), where Rossini wrote for him the role of Almaviva in The Barber of Seville. Thereafter he worked principally in London and Paris, singing and composing. In 1825 he formed an opera company, which included his son Manuel and his celebrated daughters Maria Malibran and Pauline Viardot-García, and took it to New York City and Mexico. His singing was praised for its vivacity and intelligence, and he was skilled at the art of embellishment. His son, Manuel García, incorporated García’s principles and methods in his Traité complet de l’art du chant (1847; “Complete Treatise on the Art of Singing”).
