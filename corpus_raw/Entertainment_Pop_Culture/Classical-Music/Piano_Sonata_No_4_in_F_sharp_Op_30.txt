Piano Sonata No. 4 in F-sharp, Op. 30,  sonata for solo piano by Russian pianist and composer Aleksandr Scriabin, the fourth in a cycle of 10 sonatas considered to be heir to those of Beethoven in terms of their quality. This sonata dates from 1903, when the composer was in his early 30s.
As a pianist with an active performing career, Scriabin had a repertoire that leaned toward the early Romantics: Frédéric Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, and Franz Liszt. Before long, his own works began to gain an audience and came to dominate his recital programs. He wrote his Piano Sonata No. 4 in a rush of activity during the summer of 1903. It was one of some three dozen piano pieces he produced that heady summer, after having abandoned his wife and left his teaching position at the Moscow Conservatory.
The sonata is structured in two brief movements. It begins introspectively with an “Andante” rich with intricate rhythms and three melodic ideas moving parallel to each other. By contrast, the second movement, “Prestissimo volando,” is lively and buoyant, almost danceable, and builds to strong forthright chords.
