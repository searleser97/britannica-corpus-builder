Ranieri Calzabigi,  (born Dec. 23, 1714, Livorno, Tuscany [Italy]—died  July 1795, Naples), Italian poet, librettist, and music theorist who exerted an important influence on Christoph Willibald Gluck’s reforms in opera.
During the 1750s, Calzabigi formed an association with Pietro Metastasio, the most important librettist for serious opera and oratorio in the 18th century, undertaking to publish an edition of his works. Before long, however, Calzabigi became critical of Metastasio and the operatic tradition he represented; in his preface to the first volume, he began to express his ideas concerning operatic reform. While in Vienna during February 1761, Calzabigi was introduced to Gluck; on the following October 17 a performance was given of their first work of collaboration, the dramatic ballet Le Festin de pierre (Don Juan). Gluck later composed the music for the dance drama Semiramide (1765) to Calzabigi’s scenario. Together they wrote the three Italian reform operas: Orfeo ed Euridice (1762), Alceste (1767), and Paride ed Elena (1770); in each, they aimed for simplicity, truth, and naturalness (demands that primarily affected the libretto) in the tradition of the classical drama, emphasizing the purely human element. Calzabigi, whom Gluck credited as being the chief stimulus to opera reform, returned to Italy in 1780; always given to intrigue, Calzabigi had by then fallen out with Gluck, whose role in operatic reforms he now publicly played down. Curiously, his later librettos tended to revert to the older conventions he had done so much to overturn.
