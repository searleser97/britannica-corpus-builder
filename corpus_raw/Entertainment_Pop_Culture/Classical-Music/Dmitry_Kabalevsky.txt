Dmitry Kabalevsky, in full Dmitry Borisovich Kabalevsky,  (born Dec. 17 [Dec. 30, New Style], 1904, St. Petersburg, Russia—died Feb. 14, 1987, Moscow), Soviet composer of music in a nationalistic Russian idiom, whose music also found an international audience.
In 1918 Kabalevsky moved with his family to Moscow, where he studied at the Scriabin Music School from 1919 to 1925, and in 1925 he entered the Moscow Conservatory. Appointed to the conservatory’s faculty in 1932, he began to develop an excellent reputation as a music teacher. Kabalevsky began writing music at age 18, at first mostly works for the piano. He made several European tours after World War II, playing his own music, and he won numerous awards in the Soviet Union, for his music and teaching as well as his loyal service to the government.
Kabalevsky’s early music shows the influence of his teacher, the Russian composer Nikolay Myaskovsky; his own personal style, characterized by clear tonality and energetic rhythm, emerged later. Kabalevsky’s early works include the Piano Sonata No. 1 (1928) and the Piano Concerto No. 2 (1935), one of his finest compositions. He is perhaps best known for the overture to his opera Colas Breugnon (1936, after the novel by Romain Rolland; rev. 1953, 1969) and for his suite The Comedians (1940). His later compositions include the operetta The Sisters (1967) and the oratorio Letter to the 30th Century (1972). In addition to operas and piano music, Kabalevsky wrote concerti, chamber music, symphonies, and dramatic pieces.
