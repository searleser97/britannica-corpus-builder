James McCracken,  (born Dec. 16, 1926, Gary, Ind., U.S.—died  April 29, 1988, New York, N.Y.), American operatic tenor who performed with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City for three decades, first in secondary roles but later as a principal.
After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, McCracken studied with Wellington Ezekiel, who coached him for his professional debut at the Central City Opera, Colo., in the role of Rodolfo in La Bohème (1952). He made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the same work in the small role of Parpignol (1953) and made his European debut at the Vienna State Opera in Austria (1957).
The turning point in his career was his performance in the title role of Otello with the Washington (D.C.) Opera Society (1960), a role that he performed in Zurich (1960), Vienna (1960), and London (1964). In 1963 he returned to the Metropolitan as a star and took leading roles in Turandot, Pagliacci, Aïda, Il Trovatore, La Forza del destino, and Samson et Dalila, in which he performed with his wife, mezzo-soprano Sandra Warfield. He left the company in 1978 but returned to sing at the Metropolitan for its centennial in 1983 and thereafter until illness forced him to cease performing during the 1987–88 season.
