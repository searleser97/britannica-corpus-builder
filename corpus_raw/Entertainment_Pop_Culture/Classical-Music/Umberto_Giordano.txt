Umberto Giordano,  (born Aug. 28, 1867, Foggia, Italy—died Nov. 12, 1948,  Milan),  Italian opera composer in the verismo, or “realist,” style, known for his opera Andrea Chénier.
Giordano, the son of an artisan, studied music at Foggia and Naples. His early operas, among them Mala vita (1892; Evil Life), were written in the forceful, melodramatic style introduced by Pietro Mascagni in his verismo opera Cavalleria rusticana (1890). In Andrea Chénier (1896), based on the life of the French revolutionary poet, he tempered violence with gentler characteristics and scored a lasting success. Neither Fedora (1898), after Victorien Sardou, nor its successors Siberia (1903) and Madame Sans-Gêne (1915) achieved a similar popularity. In La cena delle beffe (1924; “The Feast of Jests”) he reverted to a sensational manner with a story set in medieval Florence.
