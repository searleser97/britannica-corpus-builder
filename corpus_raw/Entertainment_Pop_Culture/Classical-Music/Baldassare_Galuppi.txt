Baldassare Galuppi, byname Il Buranello,  (born Oct. 18, 1706, island of Burano, near Venice [Italy]—died  Jan. 3, 1784, Venice), Italian composer whose comic operas won him the title “father of the opera buffa.” His nickname derives from his birthplace, Burano.
Galuppi was taught by his father, a barber and violinist, and studied under A. Lotti in Venice. After producing two operas in collaboration with G.B. Pescetti (1728–29), he began composing operas for Venetian theatres. In 1741 he visited London and arranged a pasticcio, titled Alexander in Persia. Several of his own operas were produced in England, including Enrico (1743), and the contemporary music historian Charles Burney wrote of his considerable influence on English composers. In 1748 he became assistant concertmaster at San Marco Basilica in Venice and in 1762 concertmaster there. From 1766 to 1768 he was chapelmaster to Catherine II in Russia, where he composed Ifigenia in Tauride (“Iphigeneia in Tauris”), an opera seria. In 1768 he returned to Venice and resumed his duties at San Marco.
Galuppi was one of the most prolific and widely performed opera composers of the period, and his oeuvre includes at least 100 operas composed between 1722 and 1773, comic as well as serious. Many of them (after 1749) were collaborations with the famous Venetian dramatist Carlo Goldoni. Of Galuppi’s comic operas, Il filosofo di campagna (1754; “The Country Philosopher”) was the most popular. He was one of the earliest composers of opera to use the ensemble finale, in which all the characters appear in a musical ensemble that carries the action forward to the end of the act. Besides operas, Galuppi wrote religious and instrumental works.
