Václav Kašlík,  (born Sept. 28, 1917, Poličná, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic]—died  June 4, 1989, Prague), Czech composer and conductor who produced operas for theatre and television.
In Prague Kašlík studied at Charles University (1936–39) and the Prague Conservatory (1936–40), completing his studies there in the Conductors’ Master School (1940–42). He made his conducting debut in Prague (1940) and his operatic debut in Brno as producer and conductor of Orfeo ed Euridice (1941). He served as assistant director of the National Theatre of Prague (1941–43), before creating and leading the opera ensemble of the Opera of May 5th (1945–48), which was later renamed the Smetana Theatre, where he was a conductor throughout the 1950s. He then joined the National Theatre as chief opera director (1961), and he later became opera director (1966). His collaborators were the designers Josef Svoboda and Alfred Radok.
Kašlík’s best-known opera was Krakatit (1960), which had an electronic score that combined orchestral, jazz, and popular music with a text exploring the merits of atomic energy. He was known for using unorthodox sets, still projections, moving screens, and other theatrical techniques; his keen instincts for innovative touches were noted in a Kašlík-Svoboda production of Don Giovanni at the Prague Spring Festival in 1988.
