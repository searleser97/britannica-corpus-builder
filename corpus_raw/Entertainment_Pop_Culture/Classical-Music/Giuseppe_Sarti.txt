Giuseppe Sarti, byname Il Domenichino,  (baptized Dec. 1, 1729, Faenza, Papal States—died July 28, 1802, Berlin), Italian conductor and composer of liturgical music and more than 50 operas.
After studying organ and composition at an early age with Giovanni Battista Martini in Bologna, Sarti became organist of the Faenza cathedral (1748) and director of the theatre there. His first opera, Pompeo in Armenia (1752), established his musical capabilities. After the success of Il re pastore in Venice (1753; “The Shepherd King”), Sarti traveled to Copenhagen. He spent the next 20 years in various positions, including that of music director, at the courts of King Frederick V and his successor, and Sarti produced 30 operas in Italian and Danish at the Italian Opera.
Upon returning to Italy he became director of the Conservatorio dell’Ospedaletto in Venice (1775–79) and then choirmaster of the Milan cathedral (1779–84); during this time his works were increasingly popular, and he attracted many students, among them Luigi Cherubini. In 1784 he accepted an invitation to become Giovanni Paisiello’s successor as court conductor for Catherine II in St. Petersburg. While in Russia (1784–1802), Sarti established a music conservatory, investigated the laws of acoustics, and invented a device for calculating sound vibrations to determine pitch standards. The Academy of Science in St. Petersburg voted him an honorary member for his discoveries. Among his more popular operas were Ciro riconosciuto (1754; “Cyrus Recognized”), Didone abbandonata (1762), Le gelosie villane (1776; “Rustic Jealousies”), Achille in Sciro (1779), Giulio Sabino (1781), Fra i due litigánti il terzo gode (1782; “Between Two Quarrelers, a Third Profits”), and Armida e Rinaldo (1786).
