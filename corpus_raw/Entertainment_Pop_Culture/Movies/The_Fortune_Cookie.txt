The Fortune Cookie,  American screwball comedy film, released in 1966, that featured the first teaming of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau.
Sports cameraman Harry Hinkle (played by Lemmon) is accidentally injured on the field during a football game. Although not seriously hurt, he is browbeaten by his shyster lawyer and brother-in-law, Willie Gingrich (Matthau), into feigning serious injury in order to collect an insurance payment. The plan goes awry when investigators suspect a fraud, and Hinkle has to pretend that he is a virtual invalid.
Although The Fortune Cookie was long for a comedy at 125 minutes, director Billy Wilder kept the pace fast and even managed to build a considerable level of suspense. Lemmon and Matthau worked together in nine more films over more than 30 years, with their most famous work in The Odd Couple (1968). Matthau suffered a heart attack during production of The Fortune Cookie, delaying shooting for weeks, but he ultimately won the Academy Award for best supporting actor for his portrayal of one of the great con men in film history.
