The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,  British film drama, released in 1962, that was directed by Tony Richardson and featured the impressive screen debut of Tom Courtenay.
Courtenay played Colin Smith, a troubled young man sent to a reform school after he robs a bakery. A gifted runner, he is chosen to represent the institution in a key long-distance race against a prestigious school. Much of the story is told in flashback and inner monologue, revealing the thoughts of the young man as he struggles with his identity while incessantly practicing in preparation for the big race. The finale finds him enacting a startling gesture of defiance: he stops near the finish line and lets the other runners pass.
The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner was based on a short story by Alan Sillitoe, who also wrote the screenplay. It is a notable example of the “Angry Young Men” films that were popular in British cinema after World War II.
