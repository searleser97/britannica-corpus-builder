The Seven Year Itch,  American comedy film, released in 1955, that was an adaptation of a hit Broadway show of the same name and featured a memorable performance by Marilyn Monroe.
Reprising his Broadway role, Tom Ewell played Richard Sherman, a middle-aged book editor whose wife and son are leaving their Manhattan home for the summer. On the evening after their departure, Richard encounters an attractive young woman (Monroe) who has moved into the apartment upstairs. Over the next two days, he begins to spend time with her, even escorting her to dinner and a movie, but he is constantly wracked with nerves as he desperately tries to control his libido. Finally, beset by guilt and fear, he decides to escape the situation and join his family in Maine.
Much of the film’s humour derives from the contrast between Richard’s extreme self-consciousness, manifested in extended soliloquies that reveal his overactive imagination, and his neighbour’s seeming obliviousness to her sensuous charms. Offscreen, Monroe’s personal problems—including her divorce from Joe DiMaggio—wreaked havoc on the production, and her distractions caused The Seven Year Itch to exceed its budget, though it was quite profitable in the long run. Censors forced a good deal of the suggestiveness to be removed from the script, and several scenes were trimmed to tone down sexual innuendos. Still, the movie is perhaps best remembered for the iconic image of Monroe standing above a subway vent with her dress billowing up from the air blast. The term seven-year itch—referring to the supposed urge to stray from one’s marriage after seven years—entered the popular lexicon as a result of the film’s success.
