The Battle of Algiers, Italian La battaglia di Algeri,  Italian-Algerian war film, released in 1966, that is the signature achievement of director Gillo Pontecorvo and an acclaimed experiment in cinéma vérité.
The visually striking film documents the Algerian revolt against the French in 1954–62, with a focus on the events of 1956–57. After Ali La Pointe (played by first-time actor Brahim Hadjadj) is recruited to join the National Liberation Front (FLN), a guerrilla group led by Saari Kader (played by real-life FLN commander Saadi Yacef), he becomes actively involved in its armed insurgency against the French colonial powers in Algiers. Both sides are drawn into a prolonged conflict, as violent attacks and ensuing acts of retaliation continue for months. Eventually, French Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) succeeds at methodically dismantling the FLN, as Kader and other leaders are captured and La Pointe is killed. Three years later, however, a renewed uprising breaks out, and Algeria finally wins its independence in 1962.
The movie’s outstanding presentation of documentary-style filmmaking led many viewers to believe that Pontecorvo had used newsreel footage from the actual insurgency. In fact, every frame was shot by Pontecorvo using a 16-mm camera. In part because of Pontecorvo’s well-known Marxist leanings, some critics denounced The Battle of Algiers as anti-French propaganda, and it was not shown in France until 1971. Many others, however, found Pontecorvo’s depiction of the battle’s brutality to be perceptive and evenhanded. For decades after its release, the film was studied by both national militaries and revolutionary factions throughout the world.
