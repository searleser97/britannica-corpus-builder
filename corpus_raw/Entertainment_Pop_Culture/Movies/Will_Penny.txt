Will Penny,  American western film, released in 1968, that was an intelligent and low-key study of a cowboy faced with the dilemma of middle age. Charlton Heston gave one of his finest performances in the title role.
Will Penny is an aging cowboy who realizes that his way of life as a cowhand is coming to an end, as he is being eclipsed by younger men. While searching for work, he and two friends encounter crazed Preacher Quint (Donald Pleasence) and his three sons. A fight ensues, and Will kills one son. The preacher and his surviving boys leave but not before vowing revenge. Will subsequently takes a job working for a rancher in a remote mountain area but finds that the shack he has to use for shelter is already inhabited by Catherine Allen (Joan Hackett) and her young son, Horace (Jon Francis). Catherine explains that she is en route to California to join her husband but has found herself stranded. Will takes pity on the woman, and a friendship grows. Their happiness, however, is interrupted when the Quints attack the cabin and take Will captive, along with Catherine and Horace. Their prospects look bleak until Will’s friends make an unexpected appearance. Although Catherine hopes for a future with Will, he realizes that he is unable to settle down, and he leaves with his friends.
Will Penny was an effective character study, and Tom Gries earned praise for his impressive direction and screenplay. In addition to Heston’s fine performance, Pleasence was particularly memorable as the demented preacher. Perhaps owing to the unsatisfying ending, the film failed to find an audience, although Heston found box-office success that same year with a different film, the hugely popular Planet of the Apes.
