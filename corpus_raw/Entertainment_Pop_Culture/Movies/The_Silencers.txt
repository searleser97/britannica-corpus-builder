The Silencers,  American spy film, released in 1966, that was the first and arguably best of the Matt Helm movies, which were based on the spy novels of Donald Hamilton and starred Dean Martin.
Former secret agent Matt Helm (played by Martin) is working as a world-famous glamour photographer when he is lured back to temporary service in the intelligence agency I.C.E. He is dispatched to investigate Tung-Tze (Victor Buono), the mastermind of an international criminal organization known as Big O. Along the way, Helm meets a number of beautiful women, including Gail Hendricks (Stella Stevens), a bumbling agent whose “help” in the case often leads to unintended disasters. Helm infiltrates Tung-Tze’s enormous complex located in the desert and finds that Tung-Tze intends to initiate World War III by exploding an atomic bomb in New Mexico. Helm employs various gadgets to escape a number of death traps, and despite Gail’s incompetence, he manages to destroy the Big O facility and kill Tung-Tze.
The Matt Helm film series sought to capitalize on the popularity of James Bond, although it failed to achieve similar success. Today, the charm that might be exerted by The Silencers’s low-quality production values and vivid depiction of 1960s pop culture is offset by the film’s boorish sexism—most of the female characters are unintelligent and often clad only in lingerie. Martin starred in three Helm sequels: Murderers’ Row (1966), The Ambushers (1967), and The Wrecking Crew (1968). Tony Franciosa appeared in the TV series (1975–76) that followed, but the character bore little resemblance to Martin’s interpretation.
