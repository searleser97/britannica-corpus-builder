The Haunting,  British horror film, released in 1963, that was an adaptation of Shirley Jackson’s acclaimed The Haunting of Hill House (1959). The psychological thriller became a cult classic and is considered among the best haunted-house films.
Dr. Markway (played by Richard Johnson) leads a small group of ghost hunters to a supposedly haunted mansion to conduct experiments to prove the existence of the paranormal. The group consists of Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris), a psychologically tortured spinster who yearns for attention, especially from Dr. Markway, and who is guilt-ridden over her mother’s death; Theodora (Claire Bloom), a lesbian clairvoyant who befriends Eleanor; and a hip young cynic, Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn), whose father owns the house. Dr. Markway’s skeptical wife, Grace (Lois Maxwell), later joins the group, destroying Eleanor’s hope for a relationship with the doctor and pushing her to the edge of insanity. The paranormal activity that ensues affects the group differently, leading each to explore his or her own insecurities and leaving viewers wondering whether the real terrors are not contained in the house but exist within the psyches of the characters.
The Haunting was directed by the versatile Robert Wise, who had earlier made the science-fiction classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and the musical West Side Story (1961). He refused to resort to special effects to depict the paranormal or to spell out easy answers to the predicaments encountered during the group’s stay in the house. Instead, he knew that the audience’s imagination would concoct horrors far worse than any he could manufacture. The house deserved equal billing as a main character in the film. A sinister-looking place, it is a masterpiece of production design.
