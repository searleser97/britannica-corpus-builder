The Miracle Worker,  American dramatic biopic, released in 1962, that presented the life of Helen Keller and her teacher Annie (or Anne) Sullivan; it earned Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke Academy Awards for best actress and supporting actress, respectively.
The Miracle Worker—which was based on a Tony Award-winning play by William Gibson, who also wrote the screenplay—recounts the early years of Keller (played by Duke). It highlights her remarkable achievements despite her blindness and deafness and shows the indefatigable efforts of her teacher (Bancroft) to connect with the frustrated and recalcitrant young girl.
The battle of wills (and actual physical fights) between the strong-headed Helen and her equally stubborn teacher is captured memorably by the lead actresses in grueling scenes (for which they wore special padding for protection beneath their costumes). Both Bancroft and Duke had starred in the Broadway production of The Miracle Worker, and Arthur Penn directed both the play and the film. The story was remade as television movies in 1979 and 2000, the former starring Duke in the role of Annie Sullivan.
