The Bridge at Remagen,  American war film, released in 1969, that earned acclaim for its gripping battle sequences and fine cast.
Based on actual events, the film is set in the waning days of World War II as U.S. forces race to capture a strategic bridge at Remagen, Germany. Although German Maj. Paul Kreuger (Robert Vaughn) is ordered to destroy the bridge, he delays so that stranded columns of retreating German troops can cross back over the Rhine River. When U.S. forces reach Remagen, the bridge is still intact, and Lieut. Phil Hartman (George Segal) is ordered to seize it. Kreuger has had the bridge mined, but the resulting explosion fails to destroy it. He is later arrested by his superiors and shot for disobeying orders. Although U.S. troops seize the bridge, it collapses shortly thereafter.
The epic is loosely based on Ken Hechler’s book The Bridge at Remagen (1957). Although not as well known as other war dramas, the film was widely praised. The action sequences were marked by realism and tension—in large part because of cinematographer Stanley Cortez—and the cast gave strong performances in roles inspired by real people. Of particular note was Vaughn, as the German commander torn between duty and moral conscience, and Ben Gazzara, who portrayed a soldier who loots the bodies of dead Germans. Elmer Bernstein’s score lends substantially to the epic feel of the movie. Filming began in Czechoslovakia in 1968, but when Soviet forces invaded during the Prague Spring, the production was forced to move to Austria and Italy.
