Von Ryan’s Express,  American war film, released in 1965, that featured Frank Sinatra in an exciting tale of an Allied POW escape from occupied Italy during World War II.
The film opens in a POW camp in Italy in 1943. Italy’s defeat may be imminent, but that causes only confusion for the British and American inmates. Abused by a corrupt commandant (Adolfo Celi), the men protest and resist as best they can under the leadership of British Major Eric Fincham (Trevor Howard). The balance of power in the camp is upended by the arrival of U.S. Colonel Joseph L. Ryan (Sinatra), who becomes senior officer. He proves to be highly unpopular, earning the nickname “von Ryan” because of his perceived willingness to obey the German captors. At one point, he reveals the existence of an escape plan in order to obtain necessary medical supplies for the men. When Ryan is double-crossed by the commandant, the men’s resentment of him turns to hatred. With the collapse of Italian forces, however, Ryan concocts an audacious scheme to hijack a German train and take the prisoners to safety in Switzerland. The elaborate and dangerous plan results in the POWs being relentlessly pursued by German forces. The prisoners ultimately reach Switzerland, though not before Ryan is fatally shot.
The action-packed film, which was based on a novel by David Westheimer, features Sinatra in one of the most commanding performances of his career. He is ably supported by Howard and veteran director Mark Robson, who builds the suspense leading to the climactic scene in the Alps.
