RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.,,   American motion-picture studio that made some notable films in the 1930s and ’40s. Radio-Keith-Orpheum originated in 1928 from the merger of the Radio Corporation of America, the Keith-Albee-Orpheum theatre chain, and the American Pathé production firm. Though it was one of the major studios in Hollywood, RKO spent much of its 25 years’ existence struggling for financial stability.
During the 1930s RKO produced the well-known Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers series of musicals and the early films of Katharine Hepburn, including Bringing Up Baby (1938). Among RKO’s other better-known films were Cimarron (1931), from the novel by Edna Ferber; King Kong (1933), one of the first monster films; John Ford’s The Informer (1935); and Orson Welles’s Citizen Kane (1941), now considered a masterpiece in cinema techniques. Jacques Tourneur and Alfred Hitchcock directed several well-known psychological thrillers for the studio in the 1940s.
In 1948 the businessman and producer Howard Hughes bought RKO, but his inattention and growing reclusiveness doomed the company; it ceased production in 1953, and was sold to Desilu Productions in 1957. After numerous corporate reorganizations, the firm continued under the name RKO General, Inc., owning and operating radio and television stations, theatres, and related enterprises.
