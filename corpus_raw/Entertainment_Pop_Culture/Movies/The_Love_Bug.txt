The Love Bug,  American live-action comedy film, coproduced by Disney and released in 1968, that centred on “Herbie,” a Volkswagen Beetle that has human qualities. The film spawned a loyal fan movement and numerous sequels.
Disney regular Dean Jones played Jim Douglas, a down-and-out race car driver who discovers that the old Volkswagen Beetle he purchased has not only a mind of its own but also impressive survival instincts. The car, nicknamed Herbie, rewards Douglas for his kindness by helping him thwart his rival, a race car driver who mistreated Herbie in the past.
What might have been a routine family film quickly morphed into a virtual cottage industry as international enthusiasm for Herbie, the magical VW, spawned fan clubs, collectibles, and a loyal following that would span generations. Though the special effects did not age well, the film remained a beloved classic. Its success spawned numerous sequels, including Herbie Rides Again (1974), Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo (1977), and Herbie Goes Bananas (1980). Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005) starred Lindsay Lohan, Michael Keaton, and Matt Dillon. Original star Dean Jones also appeared in the Love Bug television series in 1982.
