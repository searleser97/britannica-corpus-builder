The Scarlet Claw,  American mystery-detective film, released in 1944, that starred Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. Though not based on any story by Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the characters, it is widely considered the best in Universal Pictures’ series of 12 Sherlock Holmes films.
Holmes and Watson attempt to solve a series of grotesque killings that are terrifying the residents of a quaint country village in Canada. Each victim is found with his or her throat torn out, and the residents are convinced that the killings are the work of a legendary monster that supposedly haunts the marshes at night. Holmes eventually deduces that the culprit is a deranged actor (played by Gerald Hamer), a master of disguise, who is seeking vengeance on those who had wronged him. However, the problem then becomes capturing the criminal before he changes identities again. In order to catch him, Holmes disguises himself as one of the intended victims, Journet (Arthur Hohl), an innkeeper who had served as a prison guard. A scuffle ensues and the murderer flees, but the actual Journet ends up killing him.
The acting by Rathbone and Bruce in The Scarlet Claw was widely praised, as it was for their other Sherlock Holmes pictures, and those actors are considered by many fans the definitive portrayers of Holmes and Watson. The film’s nightmarish atmosphere was well rendered by director and producer Roy William Neill, and the screenplay, written by Neill and Edmund L. Hartmann, boasts clever dialogue and assorted plot twists.
