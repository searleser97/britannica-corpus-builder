The Pride of the Yankees,  American biographical film, released in 1942, about New York Yankees All-Star and baseball legend Lou Gehrig. With notable performances—especially by Gary Cooper in the title role—and an inspiring story, it is considered one of the best American sports films.
Columbia University student Lou Gehrig (played by Cooper) is discovered by sportswriter Sam Blake (Walter Brennan), who tries to recruit Gehrig for the New York Yankees. Not wishing to disappoint his mother (Elsa Janssen), Gehrig decides to remain in college, but after she falls ill, he signs with the Yankees to raise money for her medical care. Gehrig becomes a star player and earns the nickname “Iron Horse,” because of his streak of playing in 2,130 consecutive games between 1925 and 1939. However, in 1938 Gehrig experiences loss of coordination, and his playing worsens. After he is benched for the first time in 1939, Gehrig finds that he suffers from a neurological disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, which later came to be known as Lou Gehrig’s disease and from which he died two years later). On July 4, 1939, at Yankee Stadium, he gives an emotional farewell speech (“Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth”) that ranks among the most famous speeches in American history.
The Pride of the Yankees blends facts with fiction in telling Gehrig’s life story. Cooper and Teresa Wright—who portrayed Gehrig’s wife, Eleanor—won praise for their moving performances, and both received Academy Award nominations. Babe Ruth, Bill Dickey, and other famed players and teammates of Gehrig portrayed themselves in the film.
