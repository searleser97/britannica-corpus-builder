Zulu,  British war film, released in 1964, that is a fact-based account of the British stand against overwhelming odds in the Battle of Rorke’s Drift (1879), one of the first significant battles of the Anglo-Zulu War in Southern Africa.
After destroying a British garrison at Isandlwana, a massive Zulu force attempts to overrun the small British depot at Rorke’s Drift. Commanding officer Lieut. John Chard (played by Stanley Baker), who has never seen combat, must rally some 120 soldiers against 4,000 Zulu warriors. His elitist second-in-command, Lieut. Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine), initially suggests abandoning the post, but Chard refuses, instead preparing defensive measures that seem woefully inadequate. Against all odds, however, the British troops hold on, despite suffering heavy casualties, and even earn the respect of their adversaries.
Zulu’s battle sequences are striking but do not overwhelm the human elements of the story. Strong performances were given by the entire cast, especially Caine in his first major role. John Barry based his score on African tribal music. The film was narrated by Richard Burton.
