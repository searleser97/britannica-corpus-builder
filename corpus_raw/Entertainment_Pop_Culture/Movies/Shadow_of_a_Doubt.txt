Shadow of a Doubt,  American thriller film, released in 1943, that Alfred Hitchcock reportedly ranked as his personal favourite of the movies he directed.
“Young Charlie” (played by Teresa Wright) is bored with her small town. Her charismatic Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotten), for whom she is named, seems to be the answer to her wishes when he comes to visit. However, Young Charlie discovers the unthinkable—the endearing Uncle Charlie who has charmed her small town is actually the “Merry Widow murderer,” a serial killer who preys on rich widows.
Hitchcock hired Our Town writer Thornton Wilder to develop the story. Unlike many of his thrillers, Hitchcock is in no hurry to present dramatic or frightening set pieces. The story unfolds in a leisurely manner, encouraging a reluctance on the part of the audience to conclude that Uncle Charlie is anything but the charming man of the world that the town and his naive family thinks he is, leading to a tension-filled climax. Cotten gives what many critics called his finest performance in his portrayal of one of the screen’s most notorious villains.
