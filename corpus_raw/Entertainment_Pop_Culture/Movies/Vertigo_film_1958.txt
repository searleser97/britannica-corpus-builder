Vertigo,  American psychological thriller film, released in 1958, that is considered one of director Alfred Hitchcock’s most complex movies. Although it received a lukewarm reception upon its release, Vertigo is now commonly ranked among the greatest movies ever made.
Detective John (“Scottie”) Ferguson (played by James Stewart) has retired from the police force because he developed a paralyzing fear of heights after a rooftop chase that resulted in a colleague’s death. He comes out of retirement, however, at the behest of Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), a college friend who wants Stewart to follow his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak), and ascertain the purpose of her peculiar behaviour. Stewart unexpectedly falls in love with her, only to witness her suicide. Devastated by Madeleine’s death, Scottie later encounters Judy Barton (Novak) and obsessively remakes her in the image of the dead Madeleine. However, Scottie does not realize that Judy already knows him because she had pretended to be Madeleine as a ruse concocted by Elster to cover up his wife’s murder.
Stewart played the most complicated role of his career, abandoning his all-American persona to portray a man driven to the edge of insanity by his obsession with a woman he fears he can never have. Novak is the epitome of the Hitchcockian icy blonde in a role Vera Miles had to turn down when she became pregnant. Vertigo is considered Hitchcock’s most personal film, with Scottie’s obsessive remaking of Judy into the character of Madeleine being a metaphor for Hitchcock’s direction of the lead actresses in his films. Vertigo is also noted for its groundbreaking camera techniques to simulate the sensation of vertigo.
