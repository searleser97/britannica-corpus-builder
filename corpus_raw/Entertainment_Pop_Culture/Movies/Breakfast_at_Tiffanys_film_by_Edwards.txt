Breakfast at Tiffany’s,  American romantic comedy film, released in 1961, that was based on the novella by Truman Capote and featured the critically acclaimed performance of Audrey Hepburn as the free-spirited Holly Golightly.
George Peppard plays Paul (“Fred”) Varjak, a straitlaced writer who falls for his neighbour Holly, a New York socialite with a “go-lightly” attitude. Their relationship, however, is complicated by her unpredictable behaviour and his involvement with a wealthy woman (played by Patricia Neal).
Outfitted by Hubert de Givenchy, Hepburn’s Holly became synonymous with Hollywood glamour. The film may seem sentimental by modern standards, but many continue to cite the charm of its cast. The sequence between Hepburn and Buddy Ebsen—as Doc Golightly, who reveals Holly’s past—is especially moving. Mickey Rooney’s caricature of a Japanese neighbour, however, later drew much criticism. Henry Mancini’s score, which won an Academy Award, is widely regarded as one of the all-time greats. Ironically, when Paramount executives first saw Breakfast at Tiffany’s, they argued that “Moon River” had to be cut because it slowed the film’s pace. Hepburn objected and prevailed. The song became a hit, and it won an Oscar in 1962.
