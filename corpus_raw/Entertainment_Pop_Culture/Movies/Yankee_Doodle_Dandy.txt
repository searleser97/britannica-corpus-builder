Yankee Doodle Dandy,  American biopic film, released in 1942, that focused on the life of vaudevillian, composer, and Broadway luminary George M. Cohan and featured an Academy Award-winning performance by James Cagney.
This remarkable life story, though somewhat distorted and sanitized in this glossy production, is winningly told in episodic flashbacks by an aging Cohan (played by Cagney). From a boyhood spent performing with his family’s vaudeville troupe, Cohan works his way up to stage stardom, and the film dramatizes several of his momentous achievements, including his composing of World War I’s de facto anthem, “Over There,” and his victorious Broadway comeback after a brief retirement.
Despite taking factual liberties, Yankee Doodle Dandy met with great acclaim. Cagney succeeded in bringing humanity and fallibility to the role of Cohan, who had approved the casting of Cagney because of the actor’s background as a vaudeville performer. Cohan’s sister, Josie, was played by Cagney’s real-life sister, Jeanne Cagney. Walter Huston earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Cohan’s father. The film featured performances of classic songs such as “Over There” and “You’re a Grand Old Flag,” both penned by Cohan, who died only months after the movie premiered.
