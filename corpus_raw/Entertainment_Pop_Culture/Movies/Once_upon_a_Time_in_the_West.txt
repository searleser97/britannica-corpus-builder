Once upon a Time in the West, Italian C’era una volta il West,  Italian western film, released in 1968, that was considered by many to be Sergio Leone’s operatic masterpiece. The epic is also notable for Henry Fonda’s playing against type as a villainous killer.
Jill (played by Claudia Cardinale) is a mail-order bride who arrives in the fictional town of Flagstone, Arizona, to find her new husband and his children murdered by a gunman named Frank (Fonda). Frank is in the employ of a railroad baron named Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti), who wants the land Jill has now inherited. Into this mix comes a man called Harmonica (Charles Bronson), who says little but proves himself adept against gunmen sent by Frank to kill him. Harmonica is on a personal mission of revenge against Frank, who forced him to kill his own brother when he was a child. Another character involved in these power struggles is Cheyenne (Jason Robards), an outlaw framed by Frank for various crimes. The complex relationships between these disparate individuals all become tied together in an intricate tale of lust, greed, and revenge.
For the film’s American release, Paramount cut roughly 25 minutes and in the process eliminated the distinctive touches—such as deliberate pacing and meticulous details—that helped define Leone’s style. The shortened version was a critical and commercial disappointment. However, the deleted scenes of this revisionist western were later restored, and the film developed an appreciative following. Fonda turned in one of his greatest performances as the ruthless Frank, and Ennio Morricone’s moving score is masterful. Once upon a Time in the West was shot in Utah and Arizona’s Monument Valley, which also figures prominently in a number of John Ford films, and the cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli is noteworthy.
