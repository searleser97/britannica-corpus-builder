Roman Holiday,  American romantic comedy film, released in 1953, that starred Audrey Hepburn in her first Hollywood feature. She won an Academy Award for best actress for her performance.
In Roman Holiday, Hepburn plays a princess who is tired of being the centre of social events and a target for the paparazzi. During a visit to Rome, she escapes her guardians in order to explore the city. While a massive search takes place, Joe Bradley (played by Gregory Peck), an American reporter, makes her acquaintance and pretends not to know her identity as he guides her on an unforgettable day around Rome.
Widely regarded as one of the most charming romances in screen history, Roman Holiday was a rare comedic outing for director William Wyler. Eddie Albert won high praise as Bradley’s photographer, who secretly trails the couple. Frank Capra was supposed to direct the film but backed out when he discovered that blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo was using Ian McLellan Hunter as his “front.” Ironically, Hunter was awarded an Oscar for his script. In 1993 the Academy issued an Oscar posthumously to Trumbo, and his name was added to the restored version of the film.
