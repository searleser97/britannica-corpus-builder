The Phantom of the Opera,  American silent horror film, released in 1925, that starred Lon Chaney in his most famous role.
The macabre story is based on French author Gaston Leroux’s novel Le Fantôme de l’opéra (1910). A disfigured eccentric genius (played by Chaney) secretly coaches an aspiring opera singer (Mary Philbin) and forces her to learn to sing majestically. The relationship turns tragic when he falls in love with her and kidnaps her to prevent her from being with her fiancé.
A troubled production, The Phantom of the Opera was actually completed in 1923 but was reworked over the next two years as nervous Universal executives pandered to critics who suggested the film needed more humour. Universal shot sequences with comedian Chester Conklin, but these were dropped. Virtually everyone agreed that the raison d’être for Phantom was to allow Chaney to demonstrate his remarkable achievement in makeup. “The Man of a Thousand Faces,” as Chaney was known, caused a sensation when the mask of the Phantom was stripped away to reveal what would become one of the most-enduring images in the history of cinema. Leroux’s novel had received only moderate sales and somewhat poor reviews. It was only with the release of the film that the story and the character of the Phantom achieved international celebrity.
