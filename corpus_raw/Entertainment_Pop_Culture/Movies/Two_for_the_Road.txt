Two for the Road,  American dramatic film, released in 1967, that employed an innovative disjointed timeline to reveal the history of a marriage. It pivoted on the considerable onscreen chemistry between leads Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney.
The story is told in a series of vignettes, which combine to create a moving portrait of a troubled  12-year-old marriage. A husband and wife (played by Finney and Hepburn) at a crossroads in their lives look back on the adventures they had while traveling around the south of France, including their first meeting and the later infidelities that threaten their bond. The nonsequential ordering of the scenes invites the audience to draw their own conclusions as to what happened between the various vignettes and what forces transformed the young lovers into the distant husband and jangled wife that they appear to be.
What could have been a maudlin story is tempered by humour and the very engaging performances of Hepburn and Finney, he in a role originally envisioned for Paul Newman. Director Stanley Donen’s decision to reveal the plot in a disjointed fashion was inspired by the storytelling techniques and jump cuts popularized by the French New Wave film movement. Interestingly, François Truffaut, one of the directors most closely identified with the New Wave, would later use one of Two for the Road’s vignettes as inspiration for his 1973 film Day for Night.
