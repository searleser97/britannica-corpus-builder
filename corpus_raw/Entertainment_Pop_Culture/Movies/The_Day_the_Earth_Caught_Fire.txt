The Day the Earth Caught Fire,  British apocalyptic science-fiction film, released in 1961, that was made during the height of the Cold War and reflected common fears about the nuclear arms race and possible harmful effects of nuclear weapons testing.
Newspaper reporter Peter Stenning (played by Edward Judd) is investigating recent events of unusual weather. He finds that the nearly simultaneous testing of nuclear weapons by the Soviet Union and the United States have apparently knocked Earth from its orbit and hurtled it toward the Sun. The planet begins to heat; water dries up; and people realize that the human race may be incinerated. Martial law is declared as scientists prepare to detonate more nuclear bombs in the hope that the explosions may correct Earth’s orbit and save it from destruction. Stenning’s newspaper prepares two headlines: “World Saved” and “World Doomed.”
Director Val Guest had to work with a limited budget, using creative matte paintings to illustrate major British landmarks devastated by the crisis. The film is often cited as one of the most underrated films of the catastrophe genre. The Day the Earth Caught Fire also fit in with a then-current vogue in British science fiction for stories of global cataclysm such as those by authors John Wyndham and J.G. Ballard.
