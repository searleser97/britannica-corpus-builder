Brute Force,  American film noir, released in 1947, that presents a grim portrayal of prison life, highlighted by a memorable war of wills between a convict and a sadistic guard.
The setting of Brute Force is Westgate Penitentiary, where the brutal Capt. Munsey (played by Hume Cronyn) uses torture as a method of discipline. Some of the inmates on his cell block—whose lives and crimes are revealed through a series of flashbacks—eventually decide to escape. The group is lead by Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster), who is in prison after having robbed a bank to pay for an operation for his sick wife. The breakout, however, goes awry. During the ensuing fighting, Joe kills Munsey before being fatally shot.
Brute Force, which was written by Richard Brooks, featured an eclectic cast of supporting actors, including Charles Bickford, Whit Bissell, and Howard Duff, in his screen debut. Jules Dassin earned acclaim for his direction, and cinematographer William Daniels was praised for his inventive use of lighting, which adds to the film’s sense of dread.
