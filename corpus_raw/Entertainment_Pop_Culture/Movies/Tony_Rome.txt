Tony Rome,  American crime film, released in 1967, that featured a memorable performance by Frank Sinatra in the title role. It was among the “neo-noir” movies of the late 1960s that sought to revive and modernize the hard-boiled detective film noirs of the 1940s.
Tony Rome (played by Sinatra) is a hard-drinking ex-cop turned private detective who lives on a boat in Miami. His former partner, who operates a local seedy motel, hires Rome to remove a drunken unconscious young woman, Diana Pines (Sue Lyon), from his establishment and to return her to her family’s mansion. Her wealthy father, construction magnate Rudolph Kosterman (Simon Oakland), in turn hires Rome to investigate the cause of the erratic behaviour of the recently married Pines. Rudolph’s wife, Rita (Gena Rowlands), then secretly hires Rome to inform her first of anything he uncovers. The investigation leads Rome into a morass of crimes, deceptions, and counter-deceptions involving thieves, blackmailers, murderers, strippers, lesbians, drunkards, drug addicts, and even a doctor stripped of his license for performing illegal abortions.
Tony Rome boasts an impressive supporting cast and clever dialogue. Director Gordon Douglas wrapped production in only 28 days, due in large part to Sinatra’s aversion to second takes. The movie made notable use of Miami locales, especially the Fontainebleau hotel, where Sinatra performed as a singer at night after filming during the day. Sinatra’s daughter Nancy sang the film’s eponymous title song. An entertaining sequel, Lady in Cement (1968), again featured Sinatra in the lead role and costarred Raquel Welch.
