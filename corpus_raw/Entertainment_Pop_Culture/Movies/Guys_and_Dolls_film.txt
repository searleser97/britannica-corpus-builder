Guys and Dolls,  American musical film, released in 1955, that was adapted from the triumphant stage hit of the same name, which was based on writings by Damon Runyon.
The story follows the antic efforts of compulsive New York gambler Nathan Detroit (played by Frank Sinatra) to stage a high-profile but illegal craps game before the police can stop him—or his long-suffering girlfriend can catch him. In the meantime, his fellow criminal, the charismatic Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), attempts to forge an unlikely romance with straight-laced mission worker Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons).
In his first and only musical, Brando sang his own songs and acquitted himself well. Two new songs were written for the film, “Adelaide” and “A Woman in Love,” and several others from the stage production were dropped. The rousing production numbers (staged by Michael Kidd) are the best-remembered aspects of the film. Gene Kelly was the first choice for the Sky Masterson role, but MGM would not lend him out. Ironically, the studio ended up distributing the film, though it did not produce it. Similarly, Betty Grable desperately wanted to play Adelaide, but Fox boss Darryl F. Zanuck refused to allow it. At one point, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were considered for the roles of Nathan and Sky.
