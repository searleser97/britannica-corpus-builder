On the Town,  American musical film, released in 1949, that was a major hit in the post-World War II era, especially noted for its lively numbers. The movie marked the first memorable pairing of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly.
On the Town, which was based on a Broadway play, tells the adventures of three sailors—Gabey (played by Kelly), Chip (Sinatra), and Ozzie (Jules Munshin)—during a hectic 24-hour shore leave in New York City. Over the course of the day, they meet and romance a dancer (Vera-Ellen), a cab driver (Betty Garrett), and an anthropologist (Ann Miller).
New York City has rarely been portrayed with such joy and exuberance. Collaborating directors Kelly and Stanley Donen insisted on filming much of the movie on location, a first for a major musical. On the Town features several enduring songs, with “New York, New York” standing out as an all-time favourite.
