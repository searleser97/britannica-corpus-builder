The Entertainer,  British dramatic film, released in 1960, that is a notable example of the British “kitchen sink” dramas produced in the post-World War II era by writers known as the Angry Young Men.
Laurence Olivier portrayed Archie Rice, a third-rate vaudeville entertainer who refuses to accept the fact that his era and career are over. A monstrous man—whose decaying career symbolically parallels the moribund state of the British Empire in the postwar era—he uses and abuses everyone in his life, including his long-suffering family, and delivers pointed commentary on the state of society as he sees it.
The Entertainer was based on a play by John Osborne, one of the leading figures in the Angry Young Men movement, which sought to cast light on pressing social issues of the day. Olivier, who also starred in the stage version, received an Academy Award nomination for his performance, which some critics said reflected the less-than-admirable aspects of his own personality. The acclaimed supporting cast includes Alan Bates, Albert Finney, and Joan Plowright, whom Olivier married the next year. The film was produced by Harry Saltzman, famous for his work on the early James Bond films.
