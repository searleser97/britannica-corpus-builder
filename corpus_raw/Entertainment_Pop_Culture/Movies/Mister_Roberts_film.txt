Mister Roberts,  American comedy film, released in 1955, featuring acclaimed performances by Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, William Powell, and James Cagney.
Mister Roberts traces the misadventures of the frustrated crew of the USS Reluctant, a cargo ship operating in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. Fonda, who won a Tony Award for his performance in the Broadway production, reprised the role of Doug Roberts, an officer who wants to transfer to a fighting ship. The tyrannical captain (played by Cagney), however, keeps the capable and respected Roberts aboard in hopes of securing a promotion.
The film got off to a rocky start when Fonda clashed with his mentor, director John Ford, over key plot elements. Because of the conflict as well as medical issues, Ford quit the film in mid-production, and the direction was taken over by Mervyn LeRoy. Despite such difficulties, the film was a success, in large part owing to its talented cast. Lemmon won an Academy Award as the bumbling, would-be tough guy Ensign Pulver. Powell, appearing in his last film role, garnered praise for his portrayal of the shipâ€™s doctor, and Cagney received rave reviews for playing one of the least sympathetic characters in his career.
