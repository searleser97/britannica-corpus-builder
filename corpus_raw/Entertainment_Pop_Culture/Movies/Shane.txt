Shane,  American western film, released in 1953, that is a classic of the genre, noted for exploiting the elegiac myths of the Old West via a unique juxtaposition of gritty realism and painstakingly composed visual symmetry.
Joe Starrett (played by Van Heflin) is a hardworking farmer who lives with his wife, Marian (Jean Arthur), and their young son, Joey (Brandon deWilde), on a homestead in Wyoming. Starrett and his fellow homesteaders are being terrorized by Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer), a cattle baron who resents the farmers’ use of precious grazing land. Ryker uses increasingly ruthless methods to drive the farmers off their land, but Starrett, as their unofficial leader, urges his friends to resist. Into the situation rides Shane (Alan Ladd), a quiet man with a mysterious past. He befriends the Starretts, all the while hiding his reputation as a legendary gunfighter. When peaceful methods fail to stop Ryker and his murderous hired gun Jack Wilson (Jack Palance), Shane abandons his vow to renounce violence. In the final showdown, he kills Ryker and Wilson but is seriously wounded. Joey, who idolizes Shane, begs the gunfighter to stay, but he refuses.
Shane was adapted from Jack Schaefer’s popular novel (1949) of the same name and was a critical and commercial success. It was directed by George Stevens and featured fine acting, an intelligent and moving script, and stunning cinematography. The notable cast was led by Ladd, who, as the doomed hero, gave what is widely considered the best performance of his career, though he failed to receive an Academy Award nomination. Also of note was Palance’s star-making turn as the ruthless assassin and deWilde’s convincing portrayal of a young boy coming of age. The finale, in which Joey tries to induce Shane to come back, is arguably the film’s most memorable scene.
