Top Hat,  American musical film, released in 1935, that was the first of the 10 films pairing Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers to boast a screenplay written specifically for them.
The film was based on the play The Girl Who Dared. A characteristic vehicle for Astaire and Rogers, it featured a slight story of initially unrequited love, mistaken identities, and a requisite happy ending and allowed for frequent and breathtaking dance numbers starring the leading pair. Astaire played an American dancer appearing in a London stage show, and Rogers was cast as the dress model he falls for at first sight. Their romance is complicated when Rogers’s character mistakenly believes the smitten dancer to be a married man.
Though Top Hat’s romantic plot is far from original, its screwball comedic touches combined with a score by Irving Berlin (who would contribute to many other Astaire films) give it an appeal beyond its dance performances. Top Hat was released at the height of the Great Depression, but its showcasing of high-society types and opulent living seemed only to entice the public. It earned more than $3 million, an enormous sum for a movie of its era.
