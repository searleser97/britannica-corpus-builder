Take the Money and Run,  American screwball comedy film, released in 1969, that was cowritten and directed by Woody Allen and marked his first leading role onscreen.
The film, presented in a “mockumentary” format, recounts the misadventures of would-be master criminal Virgil Starkwell (played by Allen) as he blunders from one petty caper to another. Virgil’s bungled attempts at robbery repeatedly land him in jail. He finds some purpose in his life, however, when, on parole, he falls in love with a woman (Janet Margolin) whose purse he had been planning to steal. In one of the movie’s most popular scenes, Virgil tries to escape prison by using a bar of soap blackened with shoe polish and whittled into the shape of a gun, a ploy that goes awry when it begins to rain.
After working as a supporting actor on the James Bond spoof Casino Royale (1967), Allen decided he could make funnier movies on his own, in a more efficient and economic manner. Though he initially wanted Jerry Lewis to direct him in his first starring role, Allen ended up taking on the task himself. Essentially a vehicle for an assortment of gags and crime-movie parodies, Take the Money and Run inspired a number of equally allusive slapstick comedies, such as those of filmmaking team David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker, who wrote and produced Airplane! (1980) and the Naked Gun series (1988–94).
