Two Women, Italian La ciociara (“The Peasant”),  Italian film drama, released in 1961, that earned Sophia Loren an Academy Award for best actress—the first Oscar ever given for a performance in a foreign-language movie.
Two Women—which was based on the novel by Alberto Moravia—is a tale of survival in war-torn Italy in the early 1940s. Cesira (played by Loren) and her teenage daughter, Rosetta (Eleonora Brown), are on the run, fleeing the Allied bombing raids on Rome. They seek sanctuary in a rural area of central Italy, where Cesira becomes involved with a gentle intellectual (Jean-Paul Belmondo). Cesira and Rosetta eventually head back to Rome but are captured and raped by Moroccan soldiers of the French army, a trauma that forever alters their lives and their relationship to each other.
Director Vittorio De Sica originally wanted actress Anna Magnani to star in the film with Loren as her daughter. Magnani, however, did not want to be seen as old enough to play the sex siren’s mother, so the movie was reenvisioned with Loren in the role of the mother. Two Women proved that Loren had far more depth as an actress than many critics had believed.
