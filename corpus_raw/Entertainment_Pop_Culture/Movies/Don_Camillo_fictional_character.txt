Don Camillo,  fictional character, a pugnacious Italian village priest whose confrontations with his equally belligerent adversary, the local communist mayor Peppone, formed the basis for a series of popular, humorous short stories by Italian author Giovanni Guareschi. The character also figured in a series of successful French-language films (1950s and ’60s) starring the French comic actor Fernandel.
Don Camillo’s exploits were first published in the Italian magazine Candido in the late 1940s. Collections of these stories include The Little World of Don Camillo (1948), Don Camillo and His Flock (1953), Don Camillo Takes the Devil by the Tail (1956; also published as Don Camillo and the Devil), Comrade Don Camillo (1963), and Don Camillo Meets the Flower Children (1969).
