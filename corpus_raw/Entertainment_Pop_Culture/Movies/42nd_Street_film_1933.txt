42nd Street,  American musical film, released in 1933, that featured innovative production numbers choreographed by Busby Berkeley. It was named for the Manhattan street that hosts many Broadway theatres. An instant and enduring classic, 42nd Street transformed the musical genre.
The story follows the lives and careers of numerous individuals involved with a big-budget Broadway musical. The director, Julian Marsh (played by Warner Baxter), is desperate for success, having lost his fortune when the stock market crashed. When the star (played by Dorothy Brock) suffers an injured ankle, ingenue Peggy Sawyer (played by Ruby Keeler) is chosen to take the musical’s lead role and becomes a breakout success. Ginger Rogers appeared in a supporting role as a wisecracking performer.
Although many of the plot elements in 42nd Street now seem clichéd, they were fresh in the early days of the sound era of motion pictures. Berkeley’s ambitious production numbers used a then-new technique of filming the dancers from unconventional angles, such as from overhead. The film was praised for successfully combining both comic and dramatic elements. It inspired a long-running Broadway hit of the same name in 1980.
