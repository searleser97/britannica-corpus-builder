Intolerance, in full Intolerance: Love’s Struggle Throughout the Ages or Intolerance: A Sun-Play of the Ages,  epic American silent film, released in 1916, that is notable for its vast sets and for its intricate plot structure. A plea for tolerance, it was director D.W. Griffith’s response to the censorship and controversy that arose over the overt racism found in his previous film, The Birth of a Nation (1915).
One of cinema’s most impressive epics, Intolerance spans the course of 2,500 years and examines human failings and prejudices through various dramatic set pieces. Crosscutting between four separate stories—the fall of ancient Babylon to the hordes of the Persian king Cyrus in 539 bce, the Crucifixion of Jesus, the Saint Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of the Huguenots in France in 1572, and a contemporary story dealing with a wrongfully condemned man—Intolerance shows the human race’s propensity for intolerance through the ages.
Although some found Intolerance to have major inconsistencies, it was lauded by other filmmakers, particularly in the Soviet Union, as a profound influence on their works. Its visual splendour, especially in the Babylon segment, is still impressive, even in the era of computer-generated imagery. American film critic Pauline Kael called Intolerance “perhaps the greatest movie ever made and the greatest folly in movie history.” The film’s weak reception from the public and critics alike left Griffith disillusioned, but from a technical standpoint it has become a landmark in film history. Griffith’s obsession with re-editing his movies resulted in surviving prints’ having different scenes and running times. (To reduce his losses, Griffith withdrew the film from distribution after 22 weeks; he subsequently cut into the negative and released the modern and the Babylonian stories as two separate features, The Mother and the Law and The Fall of Babylon, in 1919.) There is no complete version of the original presentation.
