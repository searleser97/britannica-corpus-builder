Little Caesar,  American gangster film, released in 1931, considered a classic of the genre.
In a critically acclaimed performance, Edward G. Robinson plays Rico Bandello, a petty crook who ultimately schemes his way to the top of a Chicago mob. His newfound status, however, puts him at odds with his boyhood friend Joe (played by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), and the resulting conflict leads to his downfall. With a face curled into a perennial scowl and his “School of Hard Knocks” charisma, Robinson’s Rico (known to intimates as Little Caesar) epitomized the contemporary urban gangster stereotype.
Although it was speculated that the Rico character was based on Al Capone, no hard evidence exists to support the claim. Undisputed, however, is that director Mervyn LeRoy broke new ground with his tale of crime and betrayal. Particularly notable was the film’s violence, which was unprecedented for the time. The box office success of Little Caesar led to a number of popular gangster films, many of which were produced by Warner Brothers. It also brought stardom to Robinson, who became known for his portrayals of gangsters and criminals.
