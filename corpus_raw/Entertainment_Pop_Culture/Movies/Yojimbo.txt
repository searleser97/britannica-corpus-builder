Yojimbo, (Japanese: “The Bodyguard”)  Japanese action film, released in 1961, that was cowritten and directed by Kurosawa Akira. It was inspired by Dashiell Hammett’s detective novels, including Red Harvest (1929) and The Glass Key (1931), and was patterned after American westerns, especially the lone-hero films of John Ford, and in turn Yojimbo inspired Italian “spaghetti westerns,” notably Sergio Leone’s “Dollars trilogy” starring Clint Eastwood.
Samurai Sanjūrō (played by Mifune Toshirō) is an aimless adventurer wandering through rural Japan in 1860. He comes upon a small village caught in the middle of a power struggle between two feuding, ruthless crime families. Seeking to exploit the situation, Sanjūrō allies himself with both clans and gets hired as the bodyguard for both crime lords, whereupon he pits each side against the other in a series of violent confrontations. The ploy backfires, however, and Sanjūrō finds himself tortured and barely escapes death.
Yojimbo has been emulated many times, especially by Leone, who based his 1964 western Per un pugno di dollari (A Fistful of Dollars), the first in the “Dollars trilogy,” on the Kurosawa film. Leone’s film so closely mirrors Kurosawa’s that the Japanese director and his producers successfully sued Leone and received both royalties from and international distribution rights to Leone’s film. Kurosawa followed Yojimbo with the sequel Tsubaki Sanjūrō (1962; Sanjuro), in which Mifune’s character helps a group of naive samurai fight corrupt officials in their clan.
