The Uninvited,  American horror film, released in 1944, that is considered a classic of the genre, noted for its serious and understated take on the traditional ghost story.
While on vacation, siblings Roderick (played by Ray Milland) and Pamela Fitzgerald (Ruth Hussey) impulsively purchase a house on the English coast. Their infatuation with the home diminishes, however, after they begin to encounter numerous oddities, including strange noises and smells and unexplained chills. Stella Meredith (Gail Russell), a young woman who lived there as child, becomes convinced that the house is inhabited by the spirit of her mother, Mary Meredith, who died after falling off a cliff when Stella was three. The house, however, proves unsafe for Stella, who is nearly killed one night. Soon afterward, a second presence is revealed, that of Carmel, the mistress of Stella’s father. It is eventually discovered that Carmel is actually Stella’s mother and that her ghost has been protecting Stella from Mary. After Roderick confronts Mary’s ghost, it leaves, and the spirit of Carmel, no longer needed to safeguard Stella, also disappears.
The Uninvited is effective because of its leisurely pace, which allows the tension to build gradually in tandem with the level of supernatural activity experienced in the haunted house. The camerawork of noted cinematographer Charles Lang also added to the suspense. The film’s score produced the oft-recorded single “Stella by Starlight.”
