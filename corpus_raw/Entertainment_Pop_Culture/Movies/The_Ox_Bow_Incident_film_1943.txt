The Ox-Bow Incident,  American western film, released in 1943, that was a thought-provoking and disturbing look at the dangers of mob justice. The movie, which was based on the novel of the same name by Walter van Tilburg Clark, epitomized a new maturity in the western movie genre, having progressed far beyond the simplistic horse operas that audiences initially craved.
Gil Carter (played by Henry Fonda) and his friend Art Croft (Harry Morgan) drift into a small town on the plains of Nevada in 1885. They find the place in turmoil as a result of numerous incidents of cattle rustling. Soon after their arrival, it is announced that a local rancher has been murdered and his herd has been stolen. With the sheriff out of town, his deputy takes charge and forms a posse to track down the murderers. Gil and Art join the group, primarily to avoid being suspected of the crime. The posse eventually finds three men who are in possession of the cattle. Although they claim to have bought the herd legally, the men are unable to prove it. A prolonged debate takes place within the posse, with a minority of men voting to return the suspects alive for trial. However, the overwhelming majority votes to lynch the three men. After the deed has been carried out, the posse returns to town only to find a murder had not been committed, as the victim had only been wounded. Additionally, it is revealed that the real culprits were arrested. The haunting realization that innocent men were hanged results in deadly consequences.
The Ox-Bow Incident was a rare western that made acute sociological observations. Although a box-office failure due to its grim story line and claustrophobic atmosphere, the film became a classic.
