El Cid,  American-Italian epic film, released in 1961, that told the story of the 11th-century Spanish hero.
Although known for his fierce tactics on the battlefield, El Cid (“The Lord”; played by Charlton Heston) is depicted as a man who values peace and pragmatism over violence during a time when Spain is torn between warring factions of Christians and Muslims. An act of mercy granted on behalf of captured Muslim soldiers results in his being branded a traitor by Count Gormaz (Andrew Cruickshank), who is the father of El Cid’s fiancée, Jimena (Sophia Loren). El Cid is forced to duel with Gormaz, who is slain in the encounter. Although Jimena is obligated to marry her father’s slayer, she vows revenge and refuses to consummate the marriage. Years of palace intrigue follow the death of King Ferdinand I (Ralph Truman) as his heirs battle for control of the throne. During this time, El Cid finally wins the respect and love of Jimena. When an invading Muslim army from North Africa threaten to overrun Spain, he is again called into service of the throne. El Cid leads his men into battle but is mortally wounded. His dying wish is to be strapped onto his horse so that his men do not realize he has died. The ploy works, and the dead El Cid “leads” his army to overwhelming victory, becoming a Spanish legend in the process.
Director Anthony Mann crafted a fine spectacle without losing the human element. Although El Cid boasts epic battle sequences, it stresses characterizations over action. Despite the fact that they reportedly disliked each other off-screen, Heston and Loren had notable chemistry.
