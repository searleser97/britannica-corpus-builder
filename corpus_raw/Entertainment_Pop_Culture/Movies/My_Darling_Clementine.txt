My Darling Clementine,  American western film, released in 1946, that is considered a classic of the genre. It was one of the first movies to elevate Wyatt Earp to mythical status and helped establish the legend of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1881).
Wyatt Earp (played by Henry Fonda) and his brothers Virgil (Tim Holt), Morgan (Ward Bond), and James (Don Garner) are on a cattle drive from Arizona to California when they encounter Old Man Clanton (Walter Brennan) and his son Ike (Grant Withers). After refusing to sell the Clantons the cattle, Wyatt, Morgan, and Virgil ride into the town of Tombstone, Arizona. When they return, they find James dead and the herd rustled. Wyatt becomes marshal of Tombstone, and he and his brothers set out to avenge James. They befriend Doc Holliday (Victor Mature), a troubled doctor with a weakness for alcohol. However, the friendship between Wyatt and Holliday is threatened by the arrival of Doc’s former fiancée Clementine Carter (Cathy Downs), whose presence causes a rivalry between the two men. When the Clantons kill Virgil, Doc joins Wyatt and Morgan in a violent showdown against the Clantons at the O.K. Corral. The Clantons are defeated, though Doc is also killed. Wyatt and Morgan opt to leave Tombstone, and Wyatt bids farewell to Clementine.
My Darling Clementine is a rousing and engrossing western done in the usual grand style of director John Ford. Fonda gave one of his most memorable portrayals as Wyatt, and Mature and Brennan also earned praise for their performances. The screenplay is largely fictionalized, with major distortions or inaccuracies concerning the main characters; notably, in real life Doc did not die during the shoot-out. However, the staging of the gunfight itself was based on the firsthand account related to Ford by Wyatt.
