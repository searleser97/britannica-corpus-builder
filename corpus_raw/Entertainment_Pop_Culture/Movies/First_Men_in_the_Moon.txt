First Men in the Moon,  British science-fiction film, released in 1964, that was based on H.G. Wells’s novel of the same name. It blends the contemporary space race of the 1960s with a story about a Victorian-era expedition to the Moon.
The film opens with a multinational lunar expedition sponsored by the United Nations landing on the Moon in 1964. The astronauts quickly make a startling discovery—that a British expedition actually preceded them by 65 years. Through flashbacks, the viewer learns that a group of Victorian adventurers managed to successfully land a flight to the Moon, which they found inhabited by menacing creatures that resemble insects. The UN astronauts, however, find only ruins of the civilization, with no trace of the inhabitants. An explorer from the earlier mission speculates that the creatures died after contracting a common cold from one of his colleagues.
First Men in the Moon was especially noted for the acclaimed special effects of Ray Harryhausen. Peter Finch had a small uncredited role in the film.
