The Italian Job,  British comedy caper film, released in 1969, that was a cult favourite in the United Kingdom.
Michael Caine starred as a recently released convict who assembles a group of eccentric thieves to enact an ingenious gold robbery in Italy. After an extended car chase—featuring a fleet of innocuous Mini Cooper vehicles—the gang escapes. In the mountains of Switzerland, however, their bus skids and hangs precariously on the edge of a cliff, leaving the robbers’ fate uncertain.
The Italian Job was noted for its witty script and ingratiating performances, particularly by Caine and Noël Coward, whose hangdog expression and ever-present sophistication make for one of the most memorable crime bosses in screen history. The car stunts rank among the most legendary ever filmed, and the ending—a literal cliff hanger—was envisioned to set up a sequel that never materialized. An American remake was released in 2003, starring Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron.
