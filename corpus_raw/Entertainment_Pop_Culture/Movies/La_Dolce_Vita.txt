La Dolce Vita, (Italian: “The Sweet Life”)  Italian film, released in 1960, that was widely hailed as one of the most important ever made and the first of several acclaimed collaborations between director Federico Fellini and actor Marcello Mastroianni, who came to represent the director’s alter ego.
In La Dolce Vita, Mastroianni portrayed a disillusioned journalist and gossip writer, ashamed of the shallowness of his profession but too weak to remove himself from the nightly temptations it offers: booze, easy women, and exotic fun. Rife with irony and surreal imagery whose meaning may only have been known to the director himself, the film is a compelling indictment of the decadence of modern life, mass consumerism, and what passes for high culture.
The film’s opening scene—a helicopter flying a statue of Christ to Rome is juxtaposed with a shot of a bevy of bikini-clad women—is but one of many that mix the sacred with the shallow. Such sequences caused controversy and led some countries—and the Vatican—to condemn or outright ban the film. The sets are strange and exotic, the costumes are elaborate, and many of the movie’s scenes now rank among the most famous in film history, such as one showing the blonde, zaftig Anita Ekberg frolicking in the Trevi Fountain. La Dolce Vita is credited with contributing the word paparazzi to the English language (it derives from the name of the photographer in the film, Paparazzo) and adding the adjective “Felliniesque,” referring in part to the director’s embrace of the surreal, to the movie critic’s lexicon.
