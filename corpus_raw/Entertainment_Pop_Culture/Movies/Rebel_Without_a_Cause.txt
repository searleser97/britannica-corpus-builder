Rebel Without a Cause,  American film drama, released in 1955, that is a classic tale of teenage rebellion and angst. The movie featured James Dean in one of his final roles; he died one month before the release.
Dean played Jim, a troubled but sensitive teenager who, although rejecting his elders’ values, desperately wants to belong and have purpose in his life. Soon after his family moves to a new town, he takes on violent gang members while finding comfort with fellow troubled teens Judy (played by Natalie Wood) and Plato (Sal Mineo).
Marlon Brando’s The Wild One (1953) popularized juvenile delinquency in films, and Rebel Without a Cause was one of the better movies that dealt with the topic. The film was partially shot in black and white, but the studio then stopped production and reshot in colour. A strong supporting cast included Dennis Hopper, Edward Platt, and Jim Backus, who received praise for his memorable role as Dean’s henpecked father. All three lead actors met untimely deaths. Dean died in a car crash at age 24; Mineo was stabbed to death at 37; and Wood drowned amid mysterious circumstances at 43. Their deaths only added to the cultish appeal surrounding the film.
