Goodbye, Mr. Chips,  British film drama, released in 1939, that was based on James Hilton’s highly successful novel of the same name.
Goodbye, Mr. Chips is a touching, sentimental tale of a beloved British schoolmaster (played by Robert Donat). The film traces his life and career from his days as a nervous young teacher to his status as the school’s elder statesman. Despite the many challenges he faces throughout his long tenure, his devotion to the students remains steadfast.
Donat’s performance earned him the Academy Award for best actor over the presumed favourite—Clark Gable for his role in Gone with the Wind. Greer Garson also earned accolades for her portrayal of the schoolmaster’s wife. The film was remade in 1969 as a big-budget musical starring Peter O’Toole, who received an Oscar nomination for his work.
