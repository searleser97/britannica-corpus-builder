This Sporting Life,  British film drama, released in 1963, that is considered a classic of the 1960s social realist cinema in Britain. It featured Richard Harris in his first starring role.
Harris played Frank Machin, a bitter young coal miner determined to break free of his lower-class status by becoming a champion rugby player. Along the way, his aggressiveness and his grit prove assets on the field but fatal flaws in his personal life.
This Sporting Life was based on the book of the same name by David Storey, who also wrote the screenplay and who was a former professional rugby player. The rugby scenes, as a consequence, are realistic and engaging, reflecting the sportâ€™s frequent brutality. Harris won the best acting award at the 1963 Cannes film festival. Also earning critical acclaim was Rachel Roberts, who played the woman that Machin loves. Both Harris and Roberts earned Academy Award nominations for their performances. Glenda Jackson was an uncredited extra in the film.
