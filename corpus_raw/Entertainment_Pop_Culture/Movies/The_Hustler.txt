The Hustler,  American film drama, released in 1961, that won both popular and critical acclaim and earned each of its four major actors (Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, George C. Scott, and Piper Laurie) Academy Award nominations. The film sparked a resurgence of popularity in the game of pool.
Newman played “Fast” Eddie Felson, a brash pool hustler who makes a name for himself as he travels the country with an equally unscrupulous manager (played by Myron McCormick). Along the way, he encounters and uses the vulnerable Sarah (played by Laurie), with tragic results. Gleason portrayed the rotund, dapper pool champ “Minnesota Fats,” who is challenged by Fast Eddie. Scott appeared as the sinister gambling promoter Bert Gordon.
The sets and black-and-white cinematography offer a gritty realism, evoking the stench of stale cigarettes and alcohol that fills the pool halls during the film’s marathon  matches. Newman’s pool shots were mostly made by pool champion Willie Mosconi, but Gleason required no such assistance. Scott, citing his contempt for the Academy Awards, refused his supporting actor nomination for the film, becoming the first actor to do so. Newman won an Oscar for playing Felson in The Hustler’s 1986 sequel, The Color of Money, which was directed by Martin Scorsese.
