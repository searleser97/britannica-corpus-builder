The Bank Dick,  American screwball comedy film, released in 1940, that is widely regarded as one of W.C. Fields’s best movies. The comedian also wrote the film’s script.
Fields played Egbert Sousè, a henpecked drunkard who lands a job as a bank guard after unwittingly capturing a robber. After hearing a con man’s sales pitch, he convinces his future son-in-law (played by Grady Sutton), who is also a bank employee, to embezzle money in order to invest in the scheme. However, bank auditor J. Pinkerton Snoopington (Franklin Pangborn) soon arrives, and Sousè becomes embroiled in a madcap scheme to prevent Snoopington from uncovering the missing money.
Much of the film’s humour derives from Sousè’s elaborate attempts to distract the auditor, while other scenes feature the standard characters in Fields’s films, from the shrewish wife to the intractable kids. Future Three Stooges member Shemp Howard portrayed Sousè’s favourite bartender. The Bank Dick was the last film to feature Fields in a starring role. Poor health aggravated by excessive drinking relegated him to cameo appearances in subsequent films until his death in 1946. The film’s title uses a slang word for detective (“dick”).
