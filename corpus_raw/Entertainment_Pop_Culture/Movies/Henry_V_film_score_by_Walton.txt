Henry V,  film score by English composer William Walton for the 1944 Laurence Olivier film of the same name.
Walton composed music for about a dozen films, including three adaptations of  Shakespeare plays for film by Olivier (Hamlet [1948] and Richard III [1955] were the other two).
For Henry V, Walton drew upon some existing material from Shakespeare’s time, using melodies from the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, a compilation of pieces for the virginal, a small keyboard instrument related to the harpsichord. For the French scenes, Walton borrowed a pair of old French battle songs and a few themes from Joseph Canteloube’s Chants d’Auvergne, which are themselves settings of French folk songs.
