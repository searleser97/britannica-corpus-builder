The Graduate,  American dark comedy film, released in 1967, that made Dustin Hoffman a star and featured a hit sound track by the singing duo Simon and Garfunkel. The film’s groundbreaking portrayal of postgraduate malaise and the alienation of the generation then coming of age made it an unexpected hit.
Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate unsure of his future. Torn between taking the path of his father’s generation and a desire to follow his instincts, he ends up courting a beautiful young rich girl (played by Katharine Ross) on the heels of his affair with her mother, the sexy siren Mrs. Robinson (played by Anne Bancroft), who seduces him.
The Graduate, directed by Mike Nichols, arrived without much fanfare but quickly became a cultural phenomenon. The relatively unknown Hoffman rose to stardom as a result of his portrayal of Braddock, a role that originally had been considered for more established actors, including Robert Redford and Warren Beatty. Hoffman was 30 at the time of filming, and Bancroft, cast as the dangerously seductive “older woman,” was 36. Buck Henry, who cowrote the screenplay, made a cameo appearance as a hotel clerk.
