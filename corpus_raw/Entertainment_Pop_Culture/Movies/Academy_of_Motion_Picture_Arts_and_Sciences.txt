Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,  professional organization for those engaged in the production of motion pictures in the United States. Membership, which is by invitation only, is based on distinctive achievements in one of the branches of film production recognized by the academy and includes actors, writers, directors, producers, art directors, cinematographers, film editors, sound technicians, visual-effects artists, musicians, makers of short films and animated features, executives, and public relations experts.
The academy was created in 1927 by 36 film industry leaders after Louis B. Mayer, the head of the powerful Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio, actor Conrad Nagel, director Fred Niblo, and producer Fred Beetson had the idea for a new industry organization for handling labour disputes, promoting harmony among the different branches of film production (the academy’s original branches represented actors, writers, directors, producers, and technicians), improving the public image of the film industry, and providing a common ground for the discussion of new production procedures and technologies. Never an effective arbiter, the academy abandoned labour negotiations by 1937, and its focus became cultural and educational.
One of the early committees formed within the academy was assigned the task of considering awards presentations. From this committee evolved the function for which the organization is best known: the annual presentation of the Academy Awards, gold-plated statuettes (traditionally called Oscars) symbolizing recognition for excellence in acting, directing, and other areas of motion-picture production. The academy’s other activities include supporting research and education for the improvement of film technology, preserving and documenting the history of motion pictures, publishing such reference materials as the Annual Index to Motion Picture Credits, encouraging film-study programs, sponsoring vocational scholarships, fostering cooperation among the creative members of the industry, and propagating prestige for the Hollywood film industry.
