Buck Rogers,  spaceman protagonist of the first American newspaper comic strip based on serious science fiction. The strip, which first appeared in 1929, was created by writer Philip Nowlan and cartoonist Dick Calkins. Nowlan debuted the character of Anthony (“Buck”) Rogers in Armageddon: 2419 A.D. (1928–29), serialized in Amazing Stories. The comic strip was first titled Buck Rogers in the Year 2429 A.D. Later it was named Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, and it was finally titled Buck Rogers. To a lay audience, the strip introduced and popularized such science-fiction paraphernalia and concepts as ray guns, robots, and rocket ships that previously had been written about only in pulp magazines.
In the original story, Buck Rogers was a U.S. Air Force pilot who awoke from a 500-year sleep to discover that America had been overrun by Mongol invaders and was almost in ruins. Aided by his space companion Wilma Deering and his mentor, the brilliant scientist Dr. Huer, Buck Rogers defeated the invaders and freed America. A Martian and former space pirate, Black Barney, reformed and became Buck and Wilma’s stalwart sidekick. Subsequent foes included pirates from outer space, the Tiger Men of Mars, and the recurring villains Killer Kane and Ardala Valmar.
Buck Rogers appeared in comic books and was featured on a radio series (1932–47), and Buster Crabbe portrayed the character in a film serial (1939). The widespread popularity of the strip and the radio series triggered a marketing flood, and Buck Rogers ray guns, rockets, and costumes were ubiquitous in toy stores. After an initial foray into television (1950–51) fizzled, actor Gil Gerard returned Buck Rogers to the small screen nearly three decades later (1978–81). His popularity continued with the release of the second television series, which followed the success of the Star Wars franchise with a popular action-figure line.
