The Desperate Hours,  American crime film, released in 1955, that is noted for the war-of-wills tension between a ruthless killer and a terrorized family held captive.
Three escaped convicts led by Glenn Griffin (played by Humphrey Bogart) hide out in a suburban middle-class home owned by Dan Hilliard (Fredric March). The resulting confrontation becomes an engrossing cat-and-mouse game as Hilliard cooperates with the criminals, giving the impression that he is a coward, but ultimately uses his wits to overcome his adversaries and save his family.
The Desperate Hours was a return to the crime genre for director William Wyler, who had built a reputation for making so-called “women’s pictures,” notably The Little Foxes (1941) and Mrs. Miniver (1942). The role of Hilliard was originally intended for Spencer Tracy, but it ultimately went to March, who gave a powerful performance. Bogart also earned praise for his portrayal of the menacing Griffin. The film was based on a novel by Joseph Hayes and a Broadway play starring Paul Newman and Karl Malden. The Desperate Hours was remade in 1990 by director Michael Cimino with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins as the antagonists.
