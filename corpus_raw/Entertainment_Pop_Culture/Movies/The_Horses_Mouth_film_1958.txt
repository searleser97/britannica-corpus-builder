The Horse’s Mouth,  British screwball comedy film, released in 1958, that starred Alec Guinness as the eccentric fictional artist Gulley Jimson. It was adapted by Guinness from the third part of a trilogy by English novelist Joyce Cary.
Jimson is a talented but disreputable artist who has just been released from jail. Despite his fame, he lacks money. As he is unable to afford canvases, he is always in search of the perfect surface upon which to create his next masterpiece. Jimson attempts to scrape together cash from various avenues but is unsuccessful. When he visits the home of a wealthy couple, he becomes enamoured with their large plain walls, which he decides to use as the canvas for a mural without the couple’s knowledge while they are on vacation. Through a series of high jinks, he and his friends destroy the couple’s home. From there the unconventional artist moves on to another unsolicited work—painting a mural on the outside wall of a building scheduled for demolition. A group forms to finish the painting, which is completed by demolition day. However, Jimson himself drives the bulldozer that destroys the wall. Jimson then returns to his houseboat and sets sail.
Guinness, who was highly praised for his performance, also wrote the screenplay, which earned him an Academy Award nomination. His film’s ending differs from the book’s in that it features a great escape by Jimson, rather than the artist’s death.
