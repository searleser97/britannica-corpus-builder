Robin and the Seven Hoods,  American comedy musical film, released in 1964, that featured the 1960s “Rat Pack”—notably Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr.—in a parody of the legend of Robin Hood.
The film takes the topic of warring gangs in Prohibition-era Chicago and makes it into fodder for lighthearted musical comedy. After the city’s top mobster (played by Edward G. Robinson) is shot dead at his birthday party, rival leader Guy Gisborne (Peter Falk) tries to step into his position. This leads to fighting between Gisborne’s crew and that of Robbo (Frank Sinatra), who becomes a local hero after a charitable donation of misappropriated funds is traced back to him.
Previous Rat Pack films were often criticized for being halfhearted affairs, but critics considered Robin and the Seven Hoods to be far more inspired. Especially noteworthy is Davis’s superb barroom dance sequence, as well as a finale that features Sinatra crooning one of his signature songs, “My Kind of Town.” Bing Crosby makes brief but memorable appearances, especially in the “Mister Booze” song sequence. Robinson’s comedic cameo was uncredited.
