The Wages of Fear, French title Le Salaire de la peur,  French thriller film, released in 1953, that was directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot. It was based on a 1950 novel by Georges Arnaud and is considered one of the seminal films of French cinema.
A fire is raging in a South American oil well that is owned by an American company, and the only way to extinguish the petroleum-based conflagration is to use nitroglycerin. Transporting the volatile substance to the well is considered too dangerous for the company’s union workers, so four desperate locals (all of them transplanted Europeans) are lured by the promise of $2,000 per man to make the near-suicidal delivery across the hazardous South American terrain. The first part of the movie builds slowly as the four main characters are introduced, led by Yves Montand as Mario, a Corsican playboy. The characters’ dead-end lives are sketched clearly, showing why even a perilous mission is deemed a golden opportunity. Once their ominous journey begins, however, the suspense is unrelenting, as each bump in the road and jostle of the trucks tests the characters’ mettle, friendship, and nerves. Mario is the only survivor of the ordeal, receiving his pay and a hero’s welcome, but he recklessly plunges to his death from a mountain road in the very truck in which he had so carefully delivered the deadly cargo.
In its original U.S. release (1955), The Wages of Fear was cut by about 50 minutes—according to some, to eliminate the unfavourable portrayal of American oil companies—but it is now widely available in its full uncut version. Despite such difficulties, the film was well received and brought Clouzot attention both internationally and at home in France, where it won the Grand Prix at the Cannes film festival. With The Wages of Fear and his other suspense films, Clouzot became known as the “French Alfred Hitchcock.” The movie was remade by William Friedkin in 1977 as Sorcerer, starring Roy Scheider.
