The Americanization of Emily,  American comedy-drama film, released in 1964, that was noted for Paddy Chayefsky’s biting script about the absurdities of war.
James Garner portrayed Charles Madison, a cowardly aide to an unstable admiral (played by Melvyn Douglas). Hoping to gain publicity for the U.S. Navy during the Normandy Invasion in World War II, the admiral concocts a plan in which the first fatality on Omaha Beach is a sailor. The self-centred Madison reluctantly becomes involved in the scheme, thus interrupting his love affair with Emily Barham (Julie Andrews), a British war widow. Madison manages to survive the D-Day landing and becomes a reluctant hero. Although tempted to reveal the truth, he stays silent at Emily’s urging.
The Americanization of Emily was based on William Bradford Huie’s novel of the same name. The film drew acclaim for its witty dialogue and the supporting performances by Douglas and James Coburn, who portrayed Madison’s friend. Garner and Andrews, both of whom played against type, also earned praise.
