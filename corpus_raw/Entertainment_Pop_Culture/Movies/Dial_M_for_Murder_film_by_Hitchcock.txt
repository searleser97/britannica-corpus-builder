Dial M for Murder,  American thriller film, released in 1954, that was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and shot in 3-D.
Dial M for Murder, which was based on a play of the same name by Frederick Knott, centres on a murder plan gone wrong. Ray Milland portrayed the retired professional tennis player Tony Wendice, who discovers that his wealthy wife (played by Grace Kelly) had an affair. Believing that she will leave him, Wendice blackmails an old classmate into agreeing to murder her. When the plan goes awry and his wife kills her would-be killer, he devises a method of framing her for murder. The scene in which Kelly wields a pair of scissors is one of Hitchcock’s most famous.
Though shot in 3-D, Dial M for Murder was mainly shown to audiences in a standard “flat” format. It was rereleased in 3-D in the 1980s. The film was the first of three Hitchcock movies that starred Kelly; she later appeared in Rear Window (1954) and To Catch a Thief (1955). A remake of Dial M for Murder starring Michael Douglas, Viggo Mortensen, and Gwyneth Paltrow was released in 1998 as A Perfect Murder.
