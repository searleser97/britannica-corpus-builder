Ocean’s Eleven,  American heist film, released in 1960, that featured the legendary 1960s “Rat Pack” of Las Vegas entertainers, including Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin.
In the film, Danny Ocean (played by Sinatra) recruits a gang of his old army buddies to simultaneously rob five Las Vegas casinos. Overcoming various obstacles—including the arrival of Ocean’s wife (Angie Dickinson)—the men pull off the outlandish scheme but run into trouble when they try to leave Las Vegas with the money.
Perhaps no other film symbolizes the “cool” of the early 1960s more than Ocean’s Eleven. Although a major box-office success, it was dismissed at the time as a virtual home movie for the Rat Pack, who squeezed in a shooting schedule amid their nightly performances at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The film featured a number of inside jokes, and much of the script was improvised by the Rat Pack, who considered two takes to be an excessive waste of time. Memorable moments include Sammy Davis, Jr.’s rendition of the title song and amusing cameos from Red Skelton, George Raft, and Shirley MacLaine. The final scene of the gang walking past the casino marquee that bears the names of the real Rat Pack members remains an iconic cinematic image. Ocean’s Eleven inspired a later popular trilogy (2001, 2004, and 2007) that starred George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon.
