The League of Gentlemen,  British crime film, released in 1960, that defined the genre in its day, despite its grounding in humour. It was based on the novel of the same name by John Boland.
Jack Hawkins played a disgruntled ex-army colonel who recruits a group of disheartened, money-hungry former servicemen to carry out an audacious bank heist. Each of the seven men left the army under unfortunate circumstances and has since fallen on hard times. The skills and discipline that they learned in the line of duty are now needed to pull off the highly complicated, rigidly choreographed robbery.
The film highlights what was then the distinguishing difference between American and British crime movies: while American crime films generally dwelled on violent, vulgar gangsters, their British counterparts, as exemplified by The League of Gentlemen, usually presented criminals as well-mannered dapper types who prefer logic over guns as their weapon of choice. Interestingly enough, however, Hawkinsâ€™s character has each member of his team read the American crime novel The Golden Fleece (1961; also by Boland) in preparation for putting together the heist. A young Richard Attenborough appears as a former communications officer who was discharged for treason, and future director Bryan Forbes both wrote the script and had a part in the film.
