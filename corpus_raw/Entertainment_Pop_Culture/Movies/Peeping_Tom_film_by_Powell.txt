Peeping Tom,  British psychological thriller film, released in 1960, that initially caused outrage for its depiction of voyeurism, pornography, serial killing, and child abuse. However, it later came to be considered a classic.
Assistant cameraman Mark Lewis (played by Carl Boehm) is a disturbed young man who kills women and films their dying moments. As a boy he had been psychologically abused by his father (Michael Powell), who experimented on him to monitor his reaction to fear. Mark’s attempts to have a relationship with one of the tenants in his house further complicates matters, and he ultimately commits suicide.
When Peeping Tom was released, the outcry over the film’s subject matter was substantial enough to derail the career of director Michael Powell, who also portrayed the father in an uncredited performance. However, the movie is now widely considered important for its exploration of the voyeurism inherent in filmmaking and film watching.
