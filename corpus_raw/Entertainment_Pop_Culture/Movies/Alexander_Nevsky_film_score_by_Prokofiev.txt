Alexander Nevsky,  film score by Sergey Prokofiev for a patriotic epic of the same name directed by Sergey Eisenstein. The film opened in 1938 and won immediate acclaim. In 1939 Prokofiev reworked the music into a cantata for orchestra and chorus in seven movements.
The film tells the story of Alexander Nevsky, a historical figure who in 1242 led the Russian forces against the Teutonic Knights, a religious order founded during the Third Crusade. The longest and most dramatic movement of Prokofiev’s score, “The Battle on the Ice,” accompanies the film’s pivotal scene in which the mounted forces of both armies meet on a frozen lake. The movement opens with quiet tension, then bursts into frenetic action when the battle begins. Harsh tones and clashing rhythmic patterns evoke contending armies. Unexpectedly, the movement ends quietly, as if even Nevsky’s victorious forces are overcome with weariness.
Other notable sections include patriotic choruses, prayerful scenes, and a triumphant finale in which Nevsky and his forces retake the captured city of Pskov.
