Sorry, Wrong Number,  American film noir, released in 1948, that was based on Lucille Fletcher’s hit 1943 radio play of the same name.
Barbara Stanwyck played Leona Stevenson, a spoiled, wealthy invalid and hypochondriac who is confined to her bed. While trying to reach her husband (played by Burt Lancaster) on the telephone, she overhears a conversation of two men planning a murder. Her desperate attempts to identify the potential victim in time to prevent the crime lead to a complex story told in flashback involving her henpecked “boy-toy” husband and his business dealings with organized crime figures. The suspense and frustration build to a frenzied climax as Leona discovers that she herself is the intended target of the murder and that her husband is the mastermind of the plot.
Sorry, Wrong Number first gained attention as a 22-minute radio play that starred Agnes Moorehead. Her role was given to Stanwyck in the film adaptation, which was also written by Fletcher. The movie exhibits all of the elements of classic film noir, including dark scenes and looming shadows. The film was especially noted for the acclaimed performances by both Stanwyck and Lancaster.
