Witchfinder General, U.S. title The Conqueror Worm,  British horror film, released in 1968, that is noted for Vincent Price’s sinister portrayal of its main character.
Witchfinder General tells the story of Matthew Hopkins (played by Price), the real-life 17th-century Puritan lawyer and witch-finder. During the witch-hunting craze of the English Civil Wars, he and his followers terrorized English villages, identifying supposed witches for a fee. Hopkins and his assistants would torture suspected witches and force their confessions while extorting money and sex from other potential victims. He and his henchmen were responsible for some 230 deaths between 1644 and 1647. In the film, one of Hopkins’s victims is priest John Lowes (Rupert Davies). Lowes’s niece, Sara, offers herself to Hopkins in an attempt to save him. Instead, Hopkins’s assistant rapes Sara, her uncle is executed, and Hopkins and the assistant leave the village. When Sara’s lover, Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy), discovers what has happened to her, he vows revenge and begins searching for the two men who are responsible. Though Marshall and Sara are eventually caught by Hopkins and Sara is tortured, Marshall is able to exact his revenge in the end by dismembering Hopkins with an ax.
In the United States the title of the film was changed to The Conqueror Worm, after a poem of the same name by Edgar Allan Poe that Price reads in the American version. In this way, the film was loosely associated with Price’s popular collaborations with American director Roger Corman on film adaptations of several of Poe’s works.
