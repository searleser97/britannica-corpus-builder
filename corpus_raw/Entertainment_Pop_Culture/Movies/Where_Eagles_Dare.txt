Where Eagles Dare,  American-British war film, released in 1968, that was an international blockbuster, noted for its thrilling action sequences and fine performances, especially by Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood.
A top U.S. general (played by Robert Beatty) is captured by the Germans during World War II and held in a medieval castle high atop the Alps in Bavaria. Col. Turner (Patrick Wymark) of British military intelligence summons Maj. John Smith (Burton) and U.S. Army Ranger Lieut. Morris Schaffer (Eastwood) and assigns them the difficult mission of making their way into the castle and rescuing the general before the Germans can obtain details from him about the impending D-Day invasion. Once inside German territory, Smith, Schaffer, and their team of commandos pose as Nazis. They are aided by Mary (Mary Ure), an undercover agent. In the course of the mission, Smith unveils several surprising details of the raid’s actual purpose. The “general” they are rescuing is, in fact, an actor, and his rescue is intended as a catalyst for exposing the top German agents who have infiltrated British intelligence. Smith and Schaffer wreak havoc on the castle and German forces before narrowly escaping aboard a plane bound for England. During the flight, the ringleader of the double agents is exposed.
Written by Alistair MacLean, Where Eagles Dare is a complicated but entertaining tale enlivened by superbly staged action scenes; Eastwood reportedly dubbed the production “Where Doubles Dare” in reference to the dangerous stunt work. Brian G. Hutton was praised for his expert direction, and the strong supporting cast included Derren Nesbitt and Ingrid Pitt.
