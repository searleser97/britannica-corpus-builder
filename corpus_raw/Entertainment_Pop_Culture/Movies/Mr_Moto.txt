Mr. Moto, original name in full Kentaro Moto,  fictional Japanese detective and secret agent created by American novelist J.P. Marquand in No Hero (1935). Mr. Moto also was the leading character in five later Marquand mysteries.
An aristocratic, well-educated secret agent, Mr. Moto speaks English and many other languages fluently and is an excellent marksman. He is short, thin, well dressed, and well groomed, with a gold tooth. He is also an astute judge of character and recognizes and respects in an enemy agent the qualities that he values and possesses himself (such as courage, patriotism, and dedication to duty). The books in the series are Thank You, Mr. Moto (1936), Think Fast, Mr. Moto (1937), Mr. Moto Is So Sorry (1938), Last Laugh, Mr. Moto (1942), and Stopover: Tokyo (1957).
Eight films featuring Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto were made between 1937 and 1939.
