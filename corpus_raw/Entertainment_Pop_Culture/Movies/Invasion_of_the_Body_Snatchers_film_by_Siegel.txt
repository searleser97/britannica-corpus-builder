Invasion of the Body Snatchers,  American science-fiction film, released in 1956, that was directed by Don Siegel and has been hailed as one of the most intelligent films of the genre.
In the small California town of Santa Mira, several patients of Dr. Miles Bennell (played by Kevin McCarthy) claim that their loved ones have been replaced by impostors. Bennell initially diagnoses those patients as suffering from a mass delusion. Soon, however, he discovers that Santa Mira is really being quietly invaded by aliens who grow in seedpods and take over peopleâ€™s bodies while they sleep. The extraterrestrial intruders look and sound just like their victims except that they are devoid of any human emotion or feeling.
McCarthy won praise for his role as the everyman hero who tries to alert the disbelieving populace even as his few allies inevitably succumb to sleep and alien transformation. The film, which was made at the height of the Cold War, has been theorized as an indictment of or an allegory for many things, from Cold War paranoia and the fear of McCarthyism to the alienation felt in mass society to the tyrannical egalitarianism and loss of personal autonomy common in communist societies. However, Siegel dismissed such speculation and said there was nothing political in his intentions. The film was based on the novel by American writer Jack Finney and endures as one of the most popular science-fiction films ever made. It was remade several times, most notably by Philip Kaufman in 1978.
