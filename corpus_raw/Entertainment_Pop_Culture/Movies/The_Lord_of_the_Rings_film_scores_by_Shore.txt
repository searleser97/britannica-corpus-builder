The Lord of the Rings,  three film scores by Canadian composer Howard Shore for the films The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003), based on the three-part fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings (1954–56) by J.R.R. Tolkien. Shore won three Oscars and four Grammys for his work on the series. Once the Lord of the Rings films were completed, Shore crafted a symphony for orchestra, chorus, and vocal soloists based on the film music.
Shore’s score borrows techniques often associated with Richard Wagner, such as the use of recurring motifs to differentiate characters, peoples (and mythical beings), locations, and plot elements. For example, the hobbits, a race of mild-tempered, country-dwelling creatures, are given an earthy, wistful melody featuring the fiddle and tin whistle, whereas the more mysterious elves are matched with ethereal a capella voices. Shore conveys the brutality of the evil orcs with pounding percussion and blaring horns.
