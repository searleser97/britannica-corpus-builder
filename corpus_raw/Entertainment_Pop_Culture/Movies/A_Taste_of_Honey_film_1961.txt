A Taste of Honey,  British film, released in 1961, that is often cited as a classic example of the socially conscious and realistic Angry Young Man dramas that appeared in Britain in the post-World War II era.
The story centres on Jo (played by Rita Tushingham), a demure and awkward teenager driven out of her home by her promiscuous and alcoholic mother (played by Dora Bryan). After a one-night stand with a black sailor, Jo finds herself pregnant. She befriends a gay man who becomes her roommate, whereupon her mother reenters the scene and dashes the brief moment of happiness and calm in her daughter’s life.
A Taste of Honey—which was based on a play by Shelagh Delaney—raised issues of race, class, and sexual orientation. Director and producer Tony Richardson passed up an offer of American financing for the film by choosing Tushingham, not Audrey Hepburn, for the lead role. In her screen debut, Tushingham gave a compelling performance as a sympathetic lost soul.
