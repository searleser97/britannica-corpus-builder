Anatomy of a Murder,  American courtroom film drama, released in 1959, that was controversial for its explicit handling of sexual passions and the crime of rape.
The film was based on a novel by Robert Traver (pen name of Michigan Supreme Court Justice John D. Voelker). It centres on Paul Biegler (played by James Stewart), an attorney who reluctantly agrees to defend a short-tempered army lieutenant (Ben Gazzara) accused of murdering a man who allegedly raped his wife (Lee Remick).
Anatomy of a Murder is best remembered for breaking the studio’s ban on treating adult subject matters in a realistic way. Terms such as “rape,” “sperm,” “slut,” and “semen” were heard for the first time on screen. The film was also noted for the extraordinary performances of its cast, especially Remick as the wife of easy virtue with a seemingly insatiable sexual appetite. Stewart, who typically played characters that epitomized old-fashioned American values, earned praise for his gritty portrayal. Duke Ellington’s innovative jazz score was also a major asset.
