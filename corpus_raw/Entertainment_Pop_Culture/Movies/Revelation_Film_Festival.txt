Revelation Film Festival, in full Revelation Perth International Film Festival,  independent-film festival held annually during July in Perth, Austl.
Revelation Film Festival, which had its origins in 16-mm film showings in pubs and clubs in Melbourne and Perth, was formally launched in 1997 and is held for 10 days each July. The festival presents more than 100 films, with about one-third being debut screenings of Australian films. Genres represented at the festival include documentaries, animation, and both short and feature-length films. In keeping with the festival’s origins in the arts underground, its organizers have stated that they are particularly interested in “edgy and different” films. The festival is attended by more than 10,000 people, ranging from local artists and film buffs to industry personnel.
Revelation’s special programming highlights the festival’s predisposition toward unconventional offerings. In 2007, for example, to recognize the 40-year anniversary of Australian Aborigines’ being counted in the national census, Revelation featured a series of seven films celebrating Aboriginal culture. In the same year, the festival introduced a Super-8 film competition with prizes such as best film, best cinematography, and an Audience Choice Award.
In addition to showcasing films, Revelation has featured a series of talks and discussion panels under the name RevCon, introduced in 2005. Subjects have ranged from the history of Australian film since the 1970s to the state of independent cinema. RevCon has also hosted workshops on marketing and distributing independent films as well as chats with directors.
