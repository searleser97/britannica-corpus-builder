The Stalking Moon,  American western film, released in 1968, that was an inventive and highly unusual entry in the genre, noted for its avoidance of shoot-outs in favour of suspense.
Sam Varner (played by Gregory Peck) is a freelance scout in the employ of the U.S. Cavalry. His last mission prior to retiring finds him leading a detachment of troops tasked with moving Native Americans to reservations. At one camp they encounter a white woman, Sarah Carver (Eva Marie Saint), who has been held captive for many years, and her son (Noland Clay). Sam agrees to escort the pair to a train station, but along the way he discovers that the boy’s father is Salvaje (Nathaniel Narcisco), a feared and murderous Apache chief, who is now en route to reclaim his son. Against his better judgment, Sam invites the emotionally traumatized Sarah and her boy to live with him at his remote cabin near the Mexican border. Following them is Salvaje, who leaves a path of death and destruction in his wake. Forewarned of the situation by his protégé, Nick Tana (Robert Forster), Sam and his companions have the advantage of numbers. However, the arrival of the unseen Salvaje makes them aware of their mortality as he cunningly outwits them at every turn and subjects them to unspeakable terrors. The two men finally battle, with Sam killing Salvaje.
The Stalking Moon avoids showing Sam’s almost ghostly antagonist until the very end, thus making the viewer fear the unknown as much as Sam does. Despite the suspense, however, some criticized the movie for its relative lack of action. The film reunited Peck with producer Alan J. Pakula, who had directed him in his Oscar-winning performance in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962).
