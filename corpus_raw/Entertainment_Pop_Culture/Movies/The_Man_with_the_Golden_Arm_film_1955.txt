The Man with the Golden Arm,  American film drama, released in 1955, that broke new ground with its realistic look at the life of a heroin addict.
The film was based on the novel of the same name by Nelson Algren and starred Frank Sinatra as Frankie Machine, a struggling addict who gets clean while in prison. After his release, he hopes to become a drummer but is instead pressured to return to his career as a card dealer.
Because the film dealt with the then taboo subject of illicit drug use, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) refused to grant it their seal of approval. The film’s acclaim, however, contributed to the loosening of the MPAA’s restrictions on subject matter the following year. Sinatra received an Academy Award nomination for his performance, and Darren McGavin also earned praise for his portrayal of a drug dealer. The movie’s riveting jazz score by Elmer Bernstein and striking graphics by Saul Bass—especially the latter’s animated paper cutout of a heroin addict’s arm in the opening sequence—were highly innovative and were influential in the movie industry.
