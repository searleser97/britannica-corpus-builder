Champion,  American film noir, released in 1949, that was one of the first movies to expose the brutality and corruption in the sport of boxing. It garnered six Academy Award nominations and is often cited as one of the best boxing movies ever made.
Champion was based on a short story by Ring Lardner. It starred Kirk Douglas as “Midge” Kelly, a young man who rises to the top of the boxing world only to find himself isolated and mentally destroyed by the moral compromises he had to make to secure his success.
Champion was a breakthrough for Douglas, who earned an Oscar for his gritty performance. In addition, Arthur Kennedy was praised for his portrayal of Kelly’s brother. The fight scenes are brutal and intense, and the film’s tagline reflects a sentiment often associated with boxing: “This is the only sport in the world where two guys get paid for doing something they’d be arrested for if they got drunk and did it for nothing.”
