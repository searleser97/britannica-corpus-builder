Charly,  American film drama, released in 1968, that was an adaptation of Daniel Keyes’s short story “Flowers for Algernon.” Cliff Robertson, in the title role, won an Academy Award for best actor.
Charly Gordon (played by Robertson) is an intellectually disabled baker who is asked to undergo an experimental surgery. The surgery—which had dramatically increased the intelligence of a mouse named Algernon—turns Charly into a genius. His new life proves to be a mixed blessing, however. Charly experiences fame and falls in love with his teacher (played by Claire Bloom), but he also sees how many of his “friends” were mocking and exploiting him. Charly eventually learns that his intellectual prowess is only temporary, and he reverts back to his original self.
Though the practice of actors portraying intellectually disabled characters is now common, it was considered a highly risky career move in 1968. Robertson had starred in the original television productions of Days of Wine and Roses (1962) and The Hustler (1961) only to see Jack Lemmon and Paul Newman, respectively, cast in the big-screen versions. After starring in the television adaptation of Keyes’s story, Robertson bought the film rights to ensure that he would play the lead role in the movie.
