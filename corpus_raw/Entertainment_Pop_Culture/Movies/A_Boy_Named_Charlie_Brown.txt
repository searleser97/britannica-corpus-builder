A Boy Named Charlie Brown,  American animated musical film, released in 1969, that was the first of several features based on Charles M. Schulz’s popular comic strip Peanuts.
The story follows the ups and downs in the life of schoolchild and hapless everyman Charlie Brown; his irascible pet beagle, Snoopy; and his eccentric group of neighbourhood friends, including the bullying Lucy and her younger brother, Linus, who is never seen without his security blanket. Nominally about Charlie’s preparation for a high-stakes national spelling bee, the film is less concerned with plot than with message: that when life throws a curveball, one should brush off disappointment and try again.
Containing many of the classic Peanuts sight gags—such as Snoopy’s dancing and Lucy’s pulling a football away right before Charlie Brown tries to kick it—the film captures an era in time in which entertainment’s main message for children was one of wholesomeness. The film marked the final time that Peter Robbins, the original voice of Charlie Brown, voiced the character. The continuing popularity of Charlie Brown and his friends and of their annual holiday TV special, A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965), in particular, proves the enduring nature of Schulz’s characters.
