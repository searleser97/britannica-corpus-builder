The Hound of the Baskervilles,  American mystery-detective film, released in 1959, that was adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic novel of the same name. It served as Hammer Studios’ attempt to revive the Sherlock Holmes character and to begin a new movie franchise with Peter Cushing as Holmes and Andre Morell as Dr. Watson. It was notable as the first Holmes film to be shot in colour.
The Hound of the Baskervilles opens with a flashback to a brutal murder committed by Sir Hugo Baskerville (David Oxley), who is promptly killed by a mysterious and beastly attacker. The story then shifts to the film’s present, in the Victorian era, as Dr. Mortimer (Francis De Wolff) relates the scene to detective Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson, explaining it as the legend of the “Baskerville curse.” A giant demonic hound is said to stalk the eerie moors in the vicinity of Baskerville Hall and kill the estate’s heirs out of vengeance for Sir Hugo’s misdeeds. Holmes leaves Watson to protect Sir Henry Baskerville (Christopher Lee), the latest heir to the estate, as he conducts his own sleuthing in secret. Holmes eventually discovers that the real killers are lovely neighbour Cecile (Marla Landi) and her father (Ewen Solon), who are distant relatives of the Baskervilles and have their eye on the estate. As Cecile sets her huge dog—a Great Dane, not a hellhound as feared—on Sir Henry, Holmes and Watson arrive to save him. Cecile attempts to flee, but she is caught in the moor’s quicksand and dies.
Twenty years after Basil Rathbone made his debut as Sherlock Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939), Britain’s famed Hammer Studios thus revived the story for the big screen. Although the film was envisioned as a new franchise, its failure at the box office derailed any sequels, though Cushing portrayed the detective years later in a British TV series.
