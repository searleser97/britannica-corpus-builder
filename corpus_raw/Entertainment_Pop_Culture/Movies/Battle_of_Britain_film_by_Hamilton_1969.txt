Battle of Britain,  British war film, released in 1969, that recounts Great Britain’s successful defense against German air raids during World War II.
The film centres on various British military figures, a number of whom are based on real-life people, as the German air force (Luftwaffe) begins bombing England in July 1940 in preparation for an invasion. When Germany, apparently by accident, bombs civilian areas in London, the British retaliate by unexpectedly launching an air raid on Berlin. An infuriated Adolf Hitler orders the Luftwaffe to concentrate their attacks on London and other cities rather than military targets—a misjudgment that allows the British to rebuild their destroyed airfields. The resolve of Royal Air Force (RAF) pilots and the resilience of the British public ultimately force Germany to abandon its plan to invade.
Often overlooked in discussions of great war movies, Battle of Britain is an imperfect but visually stunning depiction of the Nazi bombing of London. The film was conceived by producer Harry Saltzman and director Guy Hamilton, both of whom had worked on the James Bond series of movies. They amassed a huge array of vintage aircraft and replicated battle sequences over England. Although critics complained that the movie’s love story was irrelevant and out of place, the cast—highlighted by Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Christopher Plummer, and Robert Shaw—drew acclaim.
