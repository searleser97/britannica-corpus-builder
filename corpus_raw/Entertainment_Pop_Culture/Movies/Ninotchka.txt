Ninotchka,  American romantic comedy film, released in 1939, that featured Greta Garbo in a rare nondramatic role and was marketed with the tagline “Garbo Laughs!”
The comedy stars Garbo as Ninotchka, a stern, committed communist functionary sent to Paris to rein in diplomats sent there to sell imperial jewels confiscated during the Russian Revolution of 1917. The most amusing scenes find Ninotchka reluctant to admit her blossoming feelings for a dashing count (played by Melvyn Douglas) and the latter’s increasingly successful attempts to get Ninotchka to laugh (Garbo herself was infamous for her serious demeanour). Ninotchka eventually grows to like the West and its capitalist ways.
Garbo fought with MGM for her role in Ninotchka, as studio executives were unsure that audiences would buy her in a lighthearted romp. The film earned the actress her final Academy Award nomination, but she lost to Vivien Leigh (Gone with the Wind). Garbo made one more movie and then quietly retired to a reclusive life.
In addition to Garbo’s performance, Ninotchka was noted for Ernst Lubitsch’s direction and for a witty script, which was cowritten by Billy Wilder. Bela Lugosi, who was best known for his horror films, appeared as a commissar. Ninotchka was remade into the 1957 musical Silk Stockings, starring Fred Astaire and, in the Garbo role, Cyd Charisse.
