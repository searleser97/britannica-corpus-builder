Swiss Family Robinson,  American family-adventure film, released in 1960, that is considered a Disney classic. It was adapted from the 1812 novel by Johann Rudolf Wyss and his father, Johann David Wyss.
The Robinson family—Father and Mother (played by John Mills and Dorothy McGuire, respectively) and their sons Fritz (James MacArthur), Ernst (Tommy Kirk), and Francis (Kevin Corcoran)—has left Switzerland and is en route to New Guinea when their ship is attacked by pirates. The captain and crew abandon the vessel as it begins to sink, and the Robinsons end up marooned on an uninhabited island, leading to a series of adventures. The family builds an elaborate tree house complete with ingenious contraptions resembling modern amenities, such as running water. They later discover that pirates are on the other side of the island and have hostages from a different ship, Captain Moreland (Cecil Parker) and his grandson. The two oldest Robinson boys manage to free the grandson, whom they soon discover is actually a girl (Janet Munro). The family is later attacked by the pirates and about to be overrun when Captain Moreland, who had been able to escape, brings reinforcements, and the pirates make a desperate retreat. The family is saved, but the Robinson parents decide to remain on the island, with Father becoming governor of the territory dubbed “New Switzerland.”
Swiss Family Robinson was shot on the West Indies island of Tobago, and the lush locale adds immeasurably to the timeless tale. Despite some criticisms (members of the “Swiss” family have American and British accents, and the heroes possess inexplicable skills to overcome almost any obstacle), the film’s rousing and heartwarming story proved popular with moviegoers. Swiss Family Robinson was the highest-grossing film of 1960, beating out such classics of that year as Psycho, Spartacus, Butterfield 8, The Apartment, and Ocean’s Eleven.
