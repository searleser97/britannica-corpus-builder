Exodus,  American epic film, released in 1960, that was Otto Preminger’s big-budget adaptation of Leon Uris’s best seller about the founding of the modern state of Israel in 1948.
The film opens in post-World War II Cyprus, where Jewish refugees have gathered after British forces prevented them from entering Palestine. Ari Ben Canaan (played by Paul Newman) is a member of the Haganah, a Zionist military organization. Although he served with the British during the war, he is now fighting against them in the hopes of establishing a homeland for his people. He secures access to a cargo ship and fills it with Jewish refugees, who subsequently go on a hunger strike. Facing international pressure, Britain relents and allows the ship, which is called Exodus, safe passage to Palestine. Once there, the political turmoil engulfs Ari as well as an American nurse, Kitty Fremont (Eva Marie Saint), with whom he has fallen in love. Ari becomes involved in the fighting between Jews and Palestinian Arabs, who oppose the division of their land. In addition, there is tension between the Haganah and Irgun Zvai Leumi, a militant Jewish underground movement. Through triumph and tragedy, the young couple ultimately witnesses the founding of Israel.
Exodus offers a reverent, if one-sided, look at the struggle for Israel’s independence. Strong performances—notably by Lee J. Cobb as Ari’s father and Sal Mineo as a teenaged Holocaust survivor—compensate for Dalton Trumbo’s screenplay and the film’s lengthy running time. In addition, Ernest Gold’s Academy Award-winning score is generally regarded as a classic.
