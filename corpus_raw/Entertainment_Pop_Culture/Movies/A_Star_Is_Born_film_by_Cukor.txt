A Star Is Born,  American musical film, released in 1954, that was the third—and widely considered the most enduring—version of the classic tale of passion and jealousy between a Hollywood power couple.
The film charts the rise of Esther Blodgett (played by Judy Garland) from band singer to Hollywood star. When drunken actor Norman Maine (James Mason) staggers onto the stage during her performance for a crowd of Hollywood elite, she incorporates the intrusion into her act and saves him from further embarrassment. A grateful Maine introduces her to the head of a film studio. Blodgett changes her name to Vicki Lester at the behest of the studio, and, after appearing in a hit musical, her career skyrockets. The two performers fall in love and marry, but their union is tested by Maine’s declining career and chronic alcoholism. Maine, despondent over his career and the pain he has caused Blodgett, eventually drowns himself.
Director George Cukor had filmed this tragedy once before, as What Price Hollywood? (1932), and in 1937 it was shot again as A Star Is Born. When Garland—who had appeared in an earlier radio version of the story—was refused financing for an updated film version by MGM, she and husband Sidney Luft formed their own production company and obtained the funding from Warner Brothers. Garland’s performance in the 1954 film is widely cited as her greatest. Her renditions of the film’s songs, including “Gotta Have Me Go with You” and “Born in a Trunk,” showcased the technical perfection of her voice, and the sprightly charm of her screen presence provided a stark counterpoint to Mason’s embodiment of Maine’s physical and emotional collapse. A 1976 remake of the film starred Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson.
