Now, Voyager,  American dramatic film, released in 1942, that was based on Olive Higgins Prouty’s 1941 novel of the same name. The title was derived from Walt Whitman’s poem “The Untold Want”:
The story centres on Charlotte Vale (played by Bette Davis), a dowdy spinster driven to near insanity by her domineering mother (played by Gladys Cooper). At the urging of Dr. Jaquith (Claude Rains), Charlotte enters a sanatorium, where—with the help of the doctor—she breaks her mother’s psychological hold over her. After her recovery, Charlotte is inspired to take an ocean cruise on her own. On the cruise she meets and falls in love with a dashing married man, Jerry Durrance (played by Paul Henreid). Although he is unable to leave his wife, Charlotte in a strange twist ends up taking over the care of his daughter, who is suffering from severe psychiatric problems of her own.
The film came to represent the kind of crowd-pleasing “woman’s picture” that Warner Brothers excelled at making. Jerry’s simultaneous lighting of two cigarettes and then giving one to Charlotte is a classic romantic cinematic moment, and Max Steiner’s score won an Academy Award, although Davis complained that the score overwhelmed her performance.
