Lust for Life,  American film drama, released in 1956, that chronicles the life of artist Vincent van Gogh and was notable for the acclaimed performances by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn.
Lust for Life details the passions and frustrations of van Gogh (played by Douglas), who eventually took his own life. Although relatively unknown at the time of his death, he would later be considered one of the greatest Post-Impressionists.
It took producer John Houseman almost a decade to bring Irving Stone’s best-selling fictionalized biography of van Gogh to the screen. The film, directed by Vincente Minnelli, includes numerous scenes that were shot in the actual European locales featured in van Gogh’s paintings. Douglas earned an Academy Award nomination for his fiery performance, and Quinn won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his brief appearance as painter Paul Gauguin.
