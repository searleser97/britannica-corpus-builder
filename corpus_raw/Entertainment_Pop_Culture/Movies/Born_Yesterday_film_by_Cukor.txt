Born Yesterday,  American romantic comedy film, released in 1950, in which Judy Holliday gave an Academy Award-winning performance in a role she had first made famous on Broadway.
Born Yesterday, which was based on a play by Garson Kanin, featured Holliday as Billie Dawn, the dumb mistress of low-class tycoon Harry Brock (played by Broderick Crawford), who comes to Washington to lobby congressmen. He enlists the aid of newspaperman Paul Verrall (William Holden) in polishing the manners and common sense of former showgirl Billie. As she improves her education, she realizes how she has been used by the corrupt Brock, and she begins to exact revenge in amusing ways. Ultimately, her best revenge is falling in love with Verrall.
Although Holliday triumphed in the stage version of Born Yesterday, Hollywood was not initially impressed. It was only after studio officials failed to sign other actresses for the lead role, including first-choice Rita Hayworth, that they relented and gave the part to Holliday, who went on to win an Oscar for her performance. The part relegated her to “dumb blonde” roles in future films, though she reportedly had an IQ of 172.
