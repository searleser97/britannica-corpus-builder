Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,  British musical film, released in 1968, that was based on the only children’s book written by James Bond creator Ian Fleming.
After buying a car that he names Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, eccentric inventor Caractacus Potts (played by Dick Van Dyke) invents a story in order to entertain his children. In it the car acquires magical powers and becomes embroiled in a fiendish plot to eliminate all the children of the world, masterminded by an evil baron (played by Gert Fröbe) from the land of Vulgaria.
The screenplay for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was cowritten by acclaimed children’s book author Roald Dahl. Producer Albert R. Broccoli, who worked on the original James Bond movies, cast much of the stock company from the Bond films in this big-screen take on Fleming’s story. A box-office disappointment in 1968, the film became a cult classic over time, especially in Great Britain, where the car itself achieved iconic status. Although criticized by some as overlong and sluggishly paced, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang provides some notable melodies, including its Academy Award-nominated title theme. The movie eventually inspired a play, which ran for years in London’s West End before moving to Broadway.
