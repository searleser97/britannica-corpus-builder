Limelight,  British sentimental drama film, released in 1952, that was written, directed, and produced by Charlie Chaplin, who was inspired by his experiences as a child and young man performing in music halls.
The once-famous clown Calvero (played by Chaplin) is sunk in alcoholic despair. After he rescues Terry (Claire Bloom), a young ballerina, from suicide, he finds renewed meaning in life and is inspired to return to the stage. Terry, in turn, is cured of her depression by Calvero. She becomes a famous dancer, but Calvero dies backstage after his comeback performance.
Limelight features a historic but brief comedy scene starring both Chaplin and Buster Keaton, the only time the two masters of silent comedy appeared together in film. It was during a promotional tour of England on behalf of the film, which was produced at the height of McCarthyism, that Chaplin was barred from reentering the United States owing to his alleged communist sympathies. The irony of the ban did not escape Chaplin, who was exiled while promoting one of his most apolitical films. Chaplin also wrote the score for the film, which earned him an Academy Award in 1972. The 20-year delay was due to Chaplinâ€™s exile, during which the film was not widely seen in the United States. Some U.S. theatres had even banned its showing in the 1950s.
