Shintōhō Motion Picture Company,  Japanese motion-picture studio that was known for its production of war films and action pictures appealing to mass audiences.
Formed in 1947, it was originally financed by the Tōhō Motion Picture Company. Within two years, after the motion picture Sambyaku-rokujugo-ya (1948; “Three Hundred and Sixty-five Nights”) was a financial success, Shintōhō began to open its own distribution outlets and to move toward independence from Tōhō.
In 1951, financial difficulties, resulting from lack of adequate distribution facilities and from rivalry with Tōhō, forced the studio to close for a month. Mitsugi Ōkura, the owner of a small theatre chain, became the head of the studio in 1955. He risked its future on the epic film Meiji Tennō to Nichi-Ro dai sensō (1957; “Emperor Meiji and the Great Russo-Japanese War”). Its tremendous success saved the company. Shintōhō later produced war films that appealed to ultraconservative viewers, as well as films of sex and violence directed toward urban mass audiences. The studio went bankrupt in 1961, and its assets became Tōhō’s.
