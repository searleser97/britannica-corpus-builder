Alice in Wonderland,  American animated musical film, released in 1951, that was a madcap family classic based on Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland (1865) and included elements of his later sequel, Through the Looking-Glass (1871). It was produced by Walt Disney.
The film centres on the adventures of young Alice, a dreamy, distractable girl who nevertheless proves very practical when necessary. One day, finding herself bored by her older sister’s history lesson, she notices a rabbit running by in a waistcoat and carrying a pocket watch. Curious, she follows him down a rabbit hole and into Wonderland, a bizarre, nonsensical world filled with strange characters, from a disappearing Cheshire Cat to a tea-loving Mad Hatter to the cruel Queen of Hearts, who orders Alice’s execution. Realizing that her trip to Wonderland is a dream, Alice escapes the queen by waking herself up.
The project had a very personal appeal to Disney. His early work included a number of silent short films based on the Alice stories, and he long dreamed of being able to fulfill his goal of producing a feature-length motion picture based on Carroll’s tales. The film spent years in development and production. By the time it was ready for release, Disney had enough clout to utilize the new medium of television to promote the premiere, with a special titled One Hour in Wonderland that was telecast on Dec. 25, 1950. The innovative marketing plan had little effect, however, as the film was deemed a box-office failure. It was not until the 1960s and ’70s that Alice in Wonderland became extremely popular on the film-rental market. The movie never gained the cachet or reputation of other Disney animated titles, but critics still cite it as a major achievement.
