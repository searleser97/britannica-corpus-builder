20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,  American dramatic film, released in 1954, that was the acclaimed adaptation of Jules Verne’s classic nautical adventure of the same name.
Kirk Douglas, Peter Lorre, and Paul Lukas played the hapless trio of seamen who, while attempting to investigate a string of mysterious whaling ship disappearances, are both shipwrecked and saved by Captain Nemo (played by James Mason), an ingenious pacifist who, ironically, plans to use violence to bring an end to war. They realize that Nemo is behind the sinkings, with the help of his futuristic submarine the Nautilus, which goes undetected by masquerading as a sea serpent. Pursued by warships, Nemo destroys his island home in order to prevent his secrets about nuclear power from being discovered. The three seamen escape to safety as the fatally injured Nemo takes the Nautilus for a final dive.
The film was the first live-action feature produced by Walt Disney for his own studio. An ambitious project costing more than $5 million, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was especially notable for its Academy Award-winning special effects, and the battle scene with the giant squid still stands as one of cinema’s great action sequences. Mason won special praise for his portrayal of the mad but charismatic Nemo. The film was directed by Richard Fleischer, son of legendary animator Max Fleischer, who was, ironically, Walt Disney’s most formidable competitor.
