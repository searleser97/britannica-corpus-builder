The Informer,  British film drama, released in 1935, that explores issues of personal values and conscience. It won four Academy Awards.
The film centres on Gypo Nolan (played by Victor McLaglen), an Irish drunkard who informs on the whereabouts of his best friend, a member of the Irish Republican Army wanted by the British authorities. Nolan receives a cash reward for his information, money that he and his girlfriend need to buy passage to the United States, but he realizes all too soon that the “reward” came at the cost of his self-respect and maybe even his life.
The Informer was the second film adaptation of Liam O’Flaherty’s novel of the same name; the first version was released in 1929. For the 1935 film, Dudley Nichols wrote the script in six days, and John Ford shot it in less than three weeks. McLaglen, who frequently worked with Ford, won an Oscar for his performance.
