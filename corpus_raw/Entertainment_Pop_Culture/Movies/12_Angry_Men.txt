12 Angry Men,  American courtroom film drama, released in 1957, considered a classic of the genre. It marked the feature-film directorial debut of Sidney Lumet.
The film was adapted from a 1954 television play that aired on the series Studio One. It centres on the deliberations of 12 jurors serving on a murder case. Eleven jurors vote for a quick conviction, but one holdout (played by Henry Fonda) painstakingly tries to convince the others that the accused may be innocent, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
Lumet, already an experienced theatre and television director, rehearsed his cast for two weeks and then confined them in an actual jury room where virtually the entire film was shot. The claustrophobic setting combined with the combustible personalities of a dynamic cast, including Lee J. Cobb and E.G. Marshall, to create a riveting drama. Although a critical success, the film performed poorly at the box office. In 1997 12 Angry Men was remade as an acclaimed television movie, starring Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott.
