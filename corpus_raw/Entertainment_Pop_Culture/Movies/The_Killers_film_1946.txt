The Killers,  American film noir, released in 1946, that is considered a classic of the genre. It features Burt Lancaster in his breakthrough role.
The film opens with two hit men fatally shooting Pete (“Swede”) Lund (played by Lancaster). After an insurance investigator is assigned the case, Lund’s life is revealed, partly through extended flashbacks. His real name is Ole Andersen, a former boxer who was naively led on the path to ruin by Kitty Collins (Ava Gardner), an irresistible bad girl with ties to the mob.
The Killers is an adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway short story of the same name. The film established Lancaster as a major talent, and it helped launch Gardner as one of the screen’s legendary sex symbols. Ironically, Lancaster was second choice for the role and was cast only when the original lead, Wayne Morris, became unavailable. The film is regarded as one of the top crime sagas of 1940s cinema. A 1964 remake starred Lee Marvin and Angie Dickinson.
