The Ladykillers,  British dark comedy film, released in 1955, that is considered one of the best comedies produced by the historic Ealing Studios.
Alec Guinness played Professor Marcus, the head of a motley band of criminals who use the rented rooms of an old woman’s boarding house as the base for a bank robbery. Although their scheme succeeds, they are endangered by the bothersome habits of their eccentric landlady (played by Katie Johnson), who frequently goes to the police station to report her trumped-up suspicions about various happenings in her neighbourhood. When she catches wind of the robbery and threatens to report it, the crooks reluctantly decide they have to kill her. However, when no one will commit the crime, the men turn on each other, with hilariously disastrous results.
Guinness’s acclaimed role is complemented by the noted comedic performances of Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom, both of whom later appeared in the Pink Panther series. A 2004 remake of The Ladykillers starred Tom Hanks in the Guinness role.
