Billy Budd,  British adventure film, released in 1962, that was an adaptation of a play based on Herman Melville’s unfinished novel Billy Budd, Foretopman.
Billy Budd (played by Terence Stamp) is a young seaman impressed into service on the HMS Avenger of the British navy in 1797 during the war between England and France. The captain of the Avenger, Edward Vere (Peter Ustinov), relies on his cruel and sadistic master-at-arms, John Claggart (Robert Ryan). Budd is a  naive, harmless soul whose eternal optimism remains steadfast in the face of the hardened, cynical crew. His happy-go-lucky demeanor endears him to his shipmates and officers alike—everyone except Claggart, who despises Budd’s humility and innate goodness. When Claggart learns of a conspiracy by the crew to kill him, he implicates Budd as the leader of the mutiny. Budd is confronted with the charges and, shocked, finds himself unable to speak in his own defense. He strikes Claggart instead, killing him. The punishment for attacking an officer is death, and though the other officers vote to acquit Budd, Vere pushes for the punishment to be upheld out of obligation to navy law. Budd is sentence to be hanged. At the hanging Budd publicly forgives the captain, shouting as his final words, “God bless Captain Vere!” The crew is moved to the verge of mutiny when a French ship attacks the Avenger. The crew man their stations, and, during the battle that ensues, part of the ship’s rigging falls and kills Captain Vere.
Ustinov directed, produced, and starred in the film and also cowrote the gripping screenplay. Stamp, a big-screen newcomer in 1962, garnered an Academy Award nomination (for best supporting actor) for his role as Budd. Fine performances were also rendered by Melvyn Douglas, as an old salt who befriends Budd, and by David McCallum, as an officer racked by conscience versus duty.
