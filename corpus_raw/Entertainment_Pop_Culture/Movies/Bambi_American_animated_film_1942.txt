Bambi,  American animated film, released in 1942, that is considered a classic in the Disney canon for its lush hand-drawn animation and its sensitive affective narrative.
The story chronicles the adventures of Bambi, a fawn whose father is revered as the Great Prince of the Forest. From birth Bambi is guided through life by his mother and a diverse group of woodland friends, including a rabbit named Thumper. While playing in a meadow one day, Bambi meets a female fawn, Faline. Months later Bambi’s beloved mother is killed by a hunter, forcing Bambi to grow up on his own while his father roams the forest. He playfully flirts with Faline and emerges victorious in a battle with another adolescent buck, but danger looms when hunters return. After saving Faline from a pack of hunting dogs, Bambi is wounded by gunshot. Meanwhile, a nearby campfire begins to spread. However, the two deer manage to escape to safety, and Bambi later assumes his father’s role as the Great Prince of the Forest.
The movie was adapted from the book Bambi: Eine Lebensgeschichte aus dem Walde (1923; Bambi: A Life in the Woods) by Austrian author Felix Salten. Walt Disney doted for years on his animators’ work in an effort to depict the animals’ anatomy and movement as realistically as possible. Their labours were rewarded when Bambi was released in 1942 to immediate acclaim, though the film did not start earning a profit until it was rereleased five years later. The shocking death of Bambi’s mother at the hands of an anonymous hunter—an unusually tragic moment for a children’s film—remains emotionally devastating for many viewers.
