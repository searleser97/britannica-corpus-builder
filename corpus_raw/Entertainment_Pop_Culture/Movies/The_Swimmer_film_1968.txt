The Swimmer,  American film drama, released in 1968, that was an adaptation of John Cheever’s allegorical short story of loss and disillusionment in suburban America.
Burt Lancaster, wearing only a swimsuit throughout the movie, plays a middle-aged businessman who one day inexplicably decides to “swim home” via a trail of his neighbours’ pools. The people he interacts with on this bizarre odyssey include former lovers and pretentious nouveaux riches, leading to hints about his life, shocking revelations about his character, and reflections of the superficiality of upper-middle-class suburbia.
The Swimmer was largely misunderstood by both critics and audiences and faded quickly at the box office. Lancaster’s performance, however, has been widely praised, especially for the poignant final scene, which shows his character in the rain, pounding on the door of his vacant, run-down home. The movie is also notable for featuring Marvin Hamlisch’s first film score. The Swimmer was shot in 1966 but not released until 1968, due to creative differences with director Frank Perry, who left the film before its completion. Sydney Pollack finished production.
