The Thing from Another World,  American science-fiction film, released in 1951, that was produced by film director Howard Hawks and was noted for its intelligent script.
A group of U.S. Air Force investigators uncovers the remains of a spaceship in the Arctic and in the process discover a frozen alien (played by James Arness). Upon thawing out, the alien becomes a murderous menace, stalking the group and killing them one by one. While Dr. Arthur Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite) hopes to talk to the creature and study it, the others devise a plan to kill “The Thing.” Carrington’s efforts to intervene are ultimately unsuccessful, and the alien is electrocuted.
The Thing from Another World features few special effects; “The Thing” itself is generally only glimpsed in the shadows, adding to the sense of menace. The direction of the movie is credited to Christian Nyby, but some have claimed that producer Hawks actually directed many of the scenes, though he allowed Nyby to take screen credit. The film was loosely based on the short story “Who Goes There?” by the influential science-fiction author and editor John W. Campbell, Jr. Arness later became famous as marshal Matt Dillon in the long-running Western TV show Gunsmoke. The film inspired a well-received 1982 remake directed by John Carpenter.
