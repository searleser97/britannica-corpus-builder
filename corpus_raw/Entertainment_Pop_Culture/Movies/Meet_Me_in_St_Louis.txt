Meet Me in St. Louis,  American musical film, released in 1944, that provided Judy Garland with one of the best roles of her career, as well as several of her signature songs.
The film, set in St. Louis, Mo., follows the Smith family in the days leading up to the 1904 World’s Fair. The two eldest daughters grapple with life, love, and their dread of the family’s impending move to New York City. Meet Me in St. Louis contains a number of hit songs, from the upbeat “Trolley Song” to the beautiful but sombre “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.”
Garland, under contract at MGM, was initially opposed to starring in this sentimental family tale. The part required her to portray a teenager, and, at age 21, she longed to be rid of the juvenile roles in which she had traditionally been cast. She finally relented when director Vincente Minnelli convinced her the film would be a highlight in her career. Not only was Garland pleased with the finished production, but she also fell in love with and married Minnelli. Largely for her impressive performance as the youngest Smith child, Margaret O’Brien received a special Academy Award for outstanding child actress of 1944.
