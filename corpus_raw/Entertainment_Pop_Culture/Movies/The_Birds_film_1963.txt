The Birds,  American thriller film, released in 1963, that was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and centres on a small northern California coastal town that is inexplicably attacked and rendered helpless by massive flocks of aggressive birds.
A chance encounter in a San Francisco bird shop between socialite Melanie Daniels (played by Tippi Hedren) and lawyer Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) leads Daniels to impulsively follow Brenner to his hometown of Bodega Bay. As they are about to meet, a seagull swoops down and wounds her forehead. This is the first in a series of escalating attacks by birds on the town. The final scene of thousands of birds watching Brenner’s family and Daniels driving away is chilling, though it is unfulfilling to some viewers, as Hitchcock provides no rationale for the strange and violent events that have occurred.
Hitchcock takes his time with The Birds, introducing the main characters of Daniels and Brenner and establishing their relationships long before any action ensues, thus heightening the suspense. There are memorable minor roles played by Jessica Tandy as Brenner’s mother, Lydia, and by Suzanne Pleshette as his former girlfriend Annie. The screenplay was adapted by popular writer Evan Hunter, better known by his pseudonym Ed McBain, from a novella by Daphne Du Maurier. Hitchcock used electronic sounds instead of a musical score to great effect. A strange real-life attack by sooty shearwaters on Capitola, Calif., in 1961, believed to have occurred because of diatom poisoning of anchovies digested by the birds, causing extreme aggressiveness, was researched by Hitchcock in preparation for the film.
