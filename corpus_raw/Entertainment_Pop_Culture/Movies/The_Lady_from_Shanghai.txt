The Lady from Shanghai,  American film noir, released in 1947, that was adapted from the Sherwood King novel If I Die Before I Wake. Director, writer, and star Orson Welles cast his estranged wife, Rita Hayworth, opposite himself in a film that became famous for its confounding plot and for the studio interference that marred Welles’s vision for the project.
Welles appeared in the offbeat role of Michael O’Hara, a naive man who is snared into taking a bizarre sea journey with an aging millionaire (played by Everett Sloane) and his young, sexually frustrated wife (Hayworth). This leads to O’Hara’s implication in a murder and to the bizarre trial sequence that follows. The film culminates in a legendary shootout amid a fun-house hall of mirrors.
Welles had the misfortune to come of age creatively during the era when studios tampered with films against the wishes of their directors, which resulted in Welles’s alienation from the Hollywood establishment. This trend continued with The Lady from Shanghai’s complex murder story. Columbia studio head Harry Cohn supervised the final cut, inserting a musical number for Hayworth—whose famous red hair, to the chagrin of her fans, was cut short and dyed blonde for the role—and cutting other sequences that had added to the flavour of the film. In all, more than an hour of footage was removed from Welles’s original, contributing to its cryptic story line. The film is still regarded as a worthy effort, but one that did not live up to its creator’s ambition.
