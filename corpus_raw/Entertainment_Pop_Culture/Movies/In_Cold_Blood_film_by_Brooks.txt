In Cold Blood,  American dramatic film, released in 1967, that recounts the 1959 real-life murder of an entire family at the hands of two petty criminals. The film was based on the best seller of the same name by Truman Capote.
Perry Edward Smith (played by Robert Blake) and Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson), who had met in prison, break into a Kansas farmhouse that they have been led to believe contains a safe with $10,000 inside. After killing the parents and children, the two ex-cons discover that there is no safe and flee to Mexico, where Perry dreams of prospecting for gold. When this plan fails to come to fruition, they return to the United States, supporting themselves by cashing bad checks. Meanwhile, the police, led by Kansas Bureau of Investigation agent Alvin Dewey (John Forsythe), attempt to track down the killers and finally apprehend them in Las Vegas. They are quickly put on trial and, after being convicted, are sentenced to be executed. Five years later, they are hanged.
To ensure accuracy, director Richard Brooks shot on location in Kansas, even using the house in Holcomb in which the crime occurred. The striking black-and-white cinematography, by then a rarity among American studio pictures, lends the film an air of gravity, especially in its depiction of the Clutter familyâ€™s step-by-step march to death. That one of the killers is played by Robert Blake added an unintended eeriness to the production for an early 21st-century audience, given that in 2002 Blake was charged with (though later acquitted of) the murder of his wife.
