Oliver Twist,  British dramatic film, released in 1948, that was an adaptation of Charles Dickens’s classic tale of the same name. It features a memorable performance by Alec Guinness in one of his first film roles.
The story follows the adventures of Oliver Twist (played by John Howard Davies), an orphan in 19th-century England, who encounters a number of setbacks in his quest to find security and happiness. He lives in a harshly run orphanage until being sold as an apprentice to a cruel undertaker. Oliver soon runs away and falls in with a gang of young pickpockets that is headed by slippery thief Fagin (played by Guinness), with the help of the brutal Bill Sikes (Robert Newton). Oliver is eventually able to escape from this life but not without difficulties.
Oliver Twist was director David Lean’s second adaptation of a Dickens novel. The first, Great Expectations, was released to critical acclaim in 1946; it featured Guinness in his screen debut. Oliver Twist was also widely praised, but it was not without controversy. American censors complained that Guinness’s portrayal of Fagin was anti-Semitic, and the film was not shown in the United States until three years after its release, and then only after cuts were made. Both Israel and Egypt banned the film, with the former condemning Guinness’s performance as anti-Semitic and the latter condemning it as too sympathetic. Davies would later become a major producer and director of classic British TV shows, including Benny Hill and Monty Python’s Flying Circus.
