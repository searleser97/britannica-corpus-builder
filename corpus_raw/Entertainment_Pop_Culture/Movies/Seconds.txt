Seconds,  American psychological thriller film, released in 1966, that was directed by John Frankenheimer. The film was underrated in its day but gained respect years later and attracted a cult following.
Burned-out middle-aged businessman Arthur Hamilton (played by John Randolph) is approached by a mysterious organization that can feign people’s deaths and “rebirth” them into completely new bodies and careers. He makes the momentous decision to leave behind his friends and family and embark on a new life with a new identity as artist Antiochus (“Tony”) Wilson (Rock Hudson). As happens with all Mephistophelian deals, his newfound happiness comes at a terrible price. He soon grows weary of his new life, refuses to cooperate with the mysterious company that created him, and learns to his horror that recalcitrant “reborns” become the cadavers for future reborns.
Seconds was a critical and box-office bomb upon its release and was ignored by audiences who were not used to seeing Hudson in anything but lightweight comedies. However, the stature of the film grew over time, and Seconds is now considered one of Frankenheimer’s most intriguing efforts. In addition, some critics consider Hudson’s performance to be the best of his career. James Wong Howe’s stunning cinematography earned an Academy Award nomination.
