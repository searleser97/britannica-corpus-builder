The Naked Prey,  American adventure film, released in 1966, that Cornel Wilde starred in, directed, and produced. The film was inspired by the experiences of explorer John Colter, who was pursued by Blackfoot warriors through the American frontier in the early 1800s.
The film is set in colonial South Africa in the late 19th century and features Wilde as a safari guide for hunters in search of elephants. When his clients ignore his advice and insult local tribesmen, the tribesmen capture the group and then kill the men in horrendous ways. One is roasted alive on a spit, and another is trapped in a ring of fire with a deadly snake. Wilde’s character (who is never named) is made the object of a gruesome game akin to that featured in Richard Connell’s classic short story “The Most Dangerous Game”: he is released naked and given a short head start before the warriors begin to hunt him down. Wilde’s cunning ability turns the tables on several of the natives, but he must also survive the dangers of the jungle. Once Wilde has reached the safety of a colonial fort, he turns and salutes the warrior leader (played by Ken Gampu) who has doggedly but unsuccessfully pursued him.
The film’s pace is riveting, and the atmosphere is enhanced by both the shooting of the film on location in Africa and the eerie periods of silence periodically punctuated by native African chants and drums. Wilde presents the warriors in a dignified and courageous manner, though the torture sequences are harrowing.
