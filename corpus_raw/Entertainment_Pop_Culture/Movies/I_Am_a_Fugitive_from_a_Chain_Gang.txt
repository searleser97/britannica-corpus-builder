I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang,  American dramatic film, released in 1932, that was an exposé on the life of inmates on chain gangs. It awoke social interest in and helped bring an end to the widespread use of chain gangs in the American South.
James Allen (played by Paul Muni) is an impoverished World War I veteran who is forced at gunpoint to participate in a crime. He is caught and sentenced to a chain gang in Georgia. After enduring much brutality, he escapes and becomes a successful engineer and builder. When his landlady, Marie Woods (Glenda Farrell), discovers his secret, she threatens to reveal his true identity unless he marries her. Allen later falls in love with Helen (Helen Vinson) and tells Marie he wants a divorce. She responds by turning him over to the authorities. After staging another escape, Allen goes to Helen to say goodbye. When she questions how he lives, he responds, “I steal.”
Warner Brothers considered the project to be a major risk because of the tragic plight of its protagonist. The screenplay was based on the autobiography of Robert E. Burns, who served as a consultant on the film despite being wanted for crimes in Georgia at the time. Unlike the hero of the movie, however, Burns found sanctuary in New Jersey until a reformist governor in Georgia convinced him to return, and in 1945 his sentence was commuted. Considered an early American film masterpiece, I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is a story that continues to resonate with audiences. The movie benefits from an acclaimed performance by Muni as a Jean Valjean-like hero (the protagonist of Victor Hugo’s novel Les Misérables, Valjean was imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread). The realistic and haunting ending of I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang made it unique among other films of its day. Despite the studio’s fears that Depression-era audiences would reject a downbeat drama, it became one of the top box-office hits of its time.
