Sweet Smell of Success,  American film noir, released in 1957, that was praised for its intensity, intelligent dialogue, and searing look at corruption in big-city journalism.
Burt Lancaster played J.J. Hunsecker, a ruthless Broadway columnist (based on Walter Winchell) who delights in destroying his enemies’ careers. Desperate to curry his favour, the publicist Sidney Falco (played by Tony Curtis) agrees to help Hunsecker break up the relationship between the columnist’s sister and a jazz musician.
Sweet Smell of Success was based on the short story “Tell Me About It Tomorrow” by Ernest Lehman, who cowrote the screenplay with Clifford Odets. Lancaster hides a volcano of rage beneath a quiet exterior, while Curtis gives what some have called his finest performance. The film features a classic jazz score by Elmer Bernstein, and James Wong Howe’s stark black-and-white cinematography won high acclaim. Although a critical success, the movie was a box-office disappointment.
