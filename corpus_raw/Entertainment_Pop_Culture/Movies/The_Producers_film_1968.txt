The Producers,  American screwball comedy–musical film, released in 1968, that is Mel Brooks’s first feature and his most acclaimed work.
Zero Mostel played a failed theatrical producer, and Gene Wilder was cast as his timid accountant. Together they hatch a bizarre plot to make a fortune from investors by opening a Broadway play “guaranteed” to flop—a shockingly upbeat production about Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun titled Springtime for Hitler. The play, however, fails to fail, which leads to a slew of unpredictable consequences. Along the way, Brooks skewers and satirizes various social, religious, and ethnic groups.
Mostel’s intentionally hammy performance won critical raves, and Wilder received an Academy Award nomination for his role. John Morris’s score became a classic and helped inspire the hit Broadway musical version of the movie, which debuted in 2001 starring Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick, both of whom starred in the film version of the stage musical in 2005.
