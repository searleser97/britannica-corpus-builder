The Killing,  American film noir, released in 1956, that was the first major film of director Stanley Kubrick.
Johnny Clay (played by Sterling Hayden) is a newly released convict who masterminds a complex and seemingly foolproof caper to rob a racetrack of $2 million during a race. However, the plan ultimately goes awry when one of Clay’s team, racetrack cashier George Peatty (Elisha Cook, Jr.), tells his wife, Sherry (Marie Windsor), about the heist. She in turn tells her boyfriend, Val Cannon (Vince Edwards), who decides to rob Clay’s team.
The clever script is aided by a talented but nonglamorous cast of veteran character actors. The low-budget film (it was shot in under a month) had an inglorious second-bill release, but critics and the film industry took note of Kubrick’s unique style. The Killing was developed by Kubrick and his partner James B. Harris under their newly formed production company.
