The Abominable Snowman, also called The Abominable Snowman of the Himalayas,  British horror film, released in 1957, that was one of the first in a long series of movies produced by Hammer Films and starring Peter Cushing.
English botanist John Rollason (played by Cushing) is conducting research in the Himalayas when he encounters an expedition led by a crass American, Tom Friend (Forrest Tucker). The expedition’s purpose is to find the legendary Abominable Snowman. Against the advice of his wife and the high lama, Rollason joins Friend’s team of trackers. Tragedy strikes the group at every turn, and a fight breaks out between Rollason and Friend when the former learns that the latter’s sole interest is a commercial one. They eventually find and kill the creature, but when Friend tries to remove the corpse, he attracts other Abominable Snowmen who are determined to retrieve the body of their comrade. While battling the beasts, Friend causes an avalanche that kills him, and the Abominable Snowmen are able to retrieve their compatriot’s body. Rollason, who has come to believe that the creatures are more civilized than humans, returns to the monastery, telling the lama that they found nothing.
The Abominable Snowman  was based on Nigel Kneale’s BBC television play The Creature (1957). He also adapted it for the big screen and cast many of the same actors in the film adaptation, including Cushing. It was the second Hammer film to feature Cushing, who became one of the studio’s most recognizable and frequent performers. His notable performances established Hammer as a leading producer of horror films.
