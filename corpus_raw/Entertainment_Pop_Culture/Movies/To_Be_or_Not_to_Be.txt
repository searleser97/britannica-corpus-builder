To Be or Not to Be,  American screwball comedy film, released in 1942, that was Carole Lombard’s last film. Directed by Ernst Lubitsch, it is set in German-occupied Warsaw during World War II. The film’s comedic skewering of Nazis was particularly controversial at a time when the war was ongoing.
Lombard and Jack Benny portrayed a married couple who are the leading players in a Warsaw-based company of hammy Shakespearean actors, out of work following the Nazi invasion of Poland.  They find a patriotic use for their costumes and acting abilities, however, when they become embroiled in a complicated plot to prevent a double agent from delivering vital information to the Nazis.
Lubitsch was heavily criticized for a producing a lighthearted film featuring Nazis and such irreverent lines as, “Oh, yes, I saw him in Hamlet once. What he did to Shakespeare we are now doing to Poland.” But Lubitsch, a German refugee, argued that spoofing the Nazis was an act of patriotism. Lombard (who was married to Clark Gable) died two months before the film’s release: she was on a war bond junket when her plane crashed. Mel Brooks produced a 1983 remake of the film, in which he starred with wife Anne Bancroft.
