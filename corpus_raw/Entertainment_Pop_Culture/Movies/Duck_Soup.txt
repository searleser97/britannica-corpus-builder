Duck Soup,  American screwball comedy, released in 1933, that is considered to be among the Marx Brothers’ best films. It is especially noted for its anarchic style and effective satirization of war.
Groucho Marx played Rufus T. Firefly, the cynical, sarcastic, and money-hungry leader of a fictional country called Freedonia. Margaret Dumont, a standard in the Marx Brothers’ films, was once again the butt of Groucho’s barbs, playing a rich dowager easily wooed by his questionable charms. When the ambassador of neighbouring country Sylvania attempts to overthrow Firefly—and win Dumont’s affections—Firefly declares war on Sylvania. Chico Marx portrayed a peanut seller elevated to secretary of war on the whim of Firefly, and Harpo played his characteristically silent sidekick.
The dialogue and gags are lightning fast, and the brilliantly timed mirror pantomime scene (in which Harpo mimics Groucho’s every move, pretending to be a mirror) is widely cited as the quintessential performance of the classic vaudeville routine. Though the film was a box-office disappointment, the Marx Brothers relished the fact that their ridicule of dictators so offended Italy’s Benito Mussolini that he banned the film in his country. Duck Soup was the last film that Zeppo appeared in with his brothers, as well as the last that the Marx Brothers made with Paramount.
