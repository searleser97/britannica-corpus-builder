Giant,  American film saga, released in 1956, that tracks the lives of the family members of a ranching empire in Texas. It was James Dean’s last movie; he died in a car accident shortly after filming was completed.
Based on the novel by Edna Ferber, Giant follows “Bick” Benedict (played by Rock Hudson), a Texas cattle baron. After he marries the socialite Leslie (Elizabeth Taylor), tensions mount with the young ranch hand Jett (Dean), who is envious of both Benedict’s money and his beautiful wife. After Jett receives an unexpected windfall, his wealth surpasses the Benedicts’, further fueling the rivalry.
George Stevens won an Academy Award for his direction of the big-budget production, which was also a box-office success, and the cinematography is stunning. Giant, however, is perhaps best remembered for Dean’s final performance; he received a posthumous Oscar nomination as the brooding Jett. Though the film is long, running more than three hours, the larger-than-life cast and sweeping nature of the plot have secured Giant’s perennial appeal.
