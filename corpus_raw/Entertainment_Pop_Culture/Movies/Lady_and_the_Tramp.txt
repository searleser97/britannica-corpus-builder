Lady and the Tramp,  American animated musical film, released in 1955, that, with its affecting love story featuring dogs, became one of Walt Disney’s most endearing movies.
A sweet-natured celebration of love—even by Disney standards—the story concerns the romance between Lady, an upper-class cocker spaniel, and Tramp, a stray dog from the wrong side of the tracks. When Lady’s formerly loving owners have a baby, they stop paying as much attention to their pet, and, following a run-in with two cruel Siamese cats also staying in her owners’ house, Lady runs away. She meets up with Tramp, and they share a night of adventures together  as he helps her to see the high points of life without owners. Though their spree culminates in a trip to the pound, she manages to find her way back home—and to take Tramp with her.
Lady and the Tramp was the first animated feature to be released in a widescreen version. Though critical response was initially tepid, over time it gained stature as a classic. Singer Peggy Lee cowrote the songs and voiced a number of characters in the film, including the Siamese cats that bait Lady. As performed by Lee, their number “The Siamese Cat Song” became one of the more recognizable tunes in Disney’s long history of animated musicals. A scene featuring Lady and Tramp sharing a spaghetti dinner is often ranked among the great romantic sequences in cinema history. The movie was loosely based on the little-known short story “Happy Dan, the Whistling Dog” by Ward Greene.
