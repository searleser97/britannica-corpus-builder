Days of Wine and Roses,  American film drama, released in 1962, about the ravaging effect of alcoholism on a young, codependent couple played by Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick.
Joe Clay (Lemmon) is a successful advertising executive with a beautiful wife (Remick). As their social status improves and the pressures of work mount, the couple’s reliance on alcohol grows until their addiction threatens not only their marriage but their lives.
The story, told in flashback as Lemmon’s character attends an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting, was first shown as an episode of the television series Playhouse 90 with Cliff Robertson in the starring role. The film was an important one for Lemmon, theretofore known mainly for his skill in comedies. Both he and Remick earned critical praise for their powerful performances. An acclaimed supporting cast includes Charles Bickford as Remick’s heartbroken father and Jack Klugman as an AA member trying to save Lemmon’s life. Henry Mancini composed the film’s famous title song, which won an Academy Award.
