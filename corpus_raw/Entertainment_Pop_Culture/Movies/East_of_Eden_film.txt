East of Eden,  American film drama, released in 1955, that was an adaptation of John Steinbeck’s novel of the same name. It featured James Dean in his first major role.
In this modern retelling of the story of Cain and Abel, Dean portrayed Cal Trask, a troubled youth in competition with his brother, Aron (played by Richard Davalos), for the love of his stern father (Raymond Massey), a California farmer. After the family fortunes suffer, Cal develops a plan to regain the lost wealth, but his success only increases tensions.
Dean’s breakout film made him an unexpected teen idol, and his death after East of Eden’s release not only earned him the first posthumous Oscar nomination but also ensured his status as a film legend. Director Elia Kazan received praise for his use of CinemaScope and colour to capture the verdant farmlands and fields of California, against which the troubled lives of the main characters are juxtaposed. Jo Van Fleet, in her film debut, won an Academy Award for her performance as Cal and Aron’s mother.
