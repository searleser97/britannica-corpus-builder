The Petrified Forest,  American crime film, released in 1936, that established Humphrey Bogart as a major talent. Although cast in a supporting role, he earned much of the film’s acclaim for his portrayal of the gangster Duke Mantee.
Leslie Howard played Alan Squier, a disillusioned intellectual and once-great writer who wanders into a café near Arizona’s Petrified Forest. There he meets Gabby (played by Bette Davis), a young women who longs to move to France and become an artist. The quiet is interrupted by the arrival of Duke Mantee and his thugs, who are on the run from the police. As they hold the café patrons captive, Squier realizes a way to fund Gabby’s dream. Unbeknowst to Gabby, he signs over his health insurance policy to her and asks Duke Mantee to kill him. Squier is fatally shot as Duke Mantee attempts to escape.
An abbreviated adaptation of Robert Sherwood’s hit Broadway play of the same name, The Petrified Forest was praised for keeping the emotional core of the story despite the brief 83-minute running time. Bogart’s reprisal of the role of Duke Mantee, which he played opposite Howard on Broadway, elevated him to leading-man status. Although claustrophobic in atmosphere, the film was praised for its witty dialogue and suspenseful dramatic sequences. Bogart re-created the role in a 1955 television production. A B-film remake, Escape in the Desert, was released in 1945.
