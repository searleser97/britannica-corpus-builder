The King and I,  American musical film, released in 1956, that was scored by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein and features a signature performance by Yul Brynner, who had earlier starred in the hit Broadway adaptation.
Brynner portrayed the king of Siam, an imperious monarch who is seen as immortal by his people. However, he becomes all too human and prone to self-doubt when he meets Anna (played by Deborah Kerr), a “proper” English widow who has traveled to Siam to serve as his children’s governess, teaching them the ways of the Western world. Despite their vastly different backgrounds, Anna and the king learn to respect and even admire each other.
The play and film were based on Margaret Landon’s Anna and the King of Siam (1944), which was inspired by the real-life adventures of Anna Harriette Leonowens, a British governess who worked for King Mongkut (Rama IV) of Siam. The Broadway production of The King and I was a huge success, and the film version was received with equal enthusiasm. Brynner gave the performance of his career as the exasperating, often tyrannical, but ultimately compassionate king, and he shared great on-screen chemistry with Kerr. The government of Thailand (previously known as Siam) has never officially allowed the film to be shown there because of historical inaccuracies in the depiction of the king.
