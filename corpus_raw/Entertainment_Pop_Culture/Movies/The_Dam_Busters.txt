The Dam Busters,  British World War II film, released in 1955, that chronicles the preparations for and the execution of Operation Chastise (May 16–17, 1943), in which a British air squadron used bouncing bombs to destroy hydroelectric dams that were vital to Germany’s production of war matériel.
Barnes Wallis (played by Michael Redgrave) had an unorthodox idea for attacking Germany’s heavy industrial capacity: destroy German dams in the Ruhr valley with his innovative bouncing bombs, or “dambusters.” Dangerously low-flying aircraft would be needed to deliver the bombs, which would skip across the water to their targets, sink to the base of the dams, and explode, wreaking havoc on the surrounding area. The preponderance of the film depicts the two years spent developing the explosives and training the pilots of the Royal Air Force’s 617 Squadron, which was assigned the mission. The actual operation was one of the most harrowing of the war. Of the 133 men who took part, 53 were killed, and 3 were captured after bailing out of their aircraft. Though the Germans quickly repaired the dams, the impact of the raid was significant.
The Dam Busters had a cast of British actors who conveyed the tension and high stakes surrounding the mission; Robert Shaw appeared in an early role. The film was also noted for R.C. Sherriff’s script. Some American versions of the movie were cut by as much as 15 minutes.
