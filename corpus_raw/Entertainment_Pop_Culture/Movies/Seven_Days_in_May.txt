Seven Days in May,  American political thriller film, released in 1964, that addresses the paranoia and fear of the Cold War; the movie centres on the attempted overthrow of a U.S. president.
Filmed in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis and amid worries of Armageddon, Seven Days in May involves an unpopular decision by the fictional U.S. president (Fredric March) to sign a nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. The treaty is opposed by both the military and a vast majority of the public, who do not believe the Soviets can be trusted to keep their end of the deal. Burt Lancaster portrayed a charismatic general who devises a complex plan for a military takeover, and Kirk Douglas played his aide, who sympathizes with him but feels duty bound to prevent the coup d’état.
The film focuses on conspiracies and political power, which were common themes in the work of John Frankenheimer, who had previously directed The Manchurian Candidate (1962). Seven Days in May was based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W. Bailey II and was adapted for the screen by Rod Serling. The highlight of the film is the verbal showdown between Lancaster and March. The screenplay presents both viewpoints intelligently and raises poignant questions about the limits of constitutional power in the United States. The movie features John Houseman in his feature-film debut; he played an admiral embroiled in the coup.
