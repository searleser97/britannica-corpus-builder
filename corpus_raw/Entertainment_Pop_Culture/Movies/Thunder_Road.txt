Thunder Road,  American crime-drama film, released in 1958, that is a cult classic notable for its numerous car chases and Robert Mitchum’s performance.
Mitchum played a Korean War veteran who returns to the Tennessee hills to run his family’s moonshine business. Soon, however, he becomes embroiled in a battle with gangsters and federal agents.
Despite its crude production values, Thunder Road was effectively made. It was based on a story by Mitchum, who also served as the executive producer. In addition, he cowrote and recorded a song for the soundtrack, entitled “Whippoorwill,” that was a surprise hit. In an interesting casting decision, Mitchum’s 16-year-old son, James, played his brother. The popularity of the movie was especially noted at drive-in theatres, where the movie continued to be played for years after its release.
