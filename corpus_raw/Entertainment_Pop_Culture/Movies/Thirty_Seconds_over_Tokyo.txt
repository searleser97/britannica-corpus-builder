Thirty Seconds over Tokyo,  American war film, released in 1944, that depicted the U.S. air raid on Tokyo and other Japanese cities following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor (1941). Written by Dalton Trumbo, the movie was based on the 1943 memoir by Capt. Ted W. Lawson, a pilot involved in the mission.
The World War II film centres on Lieut. Col. James H. Doolittle (played by Spencer Tracy) and the 80 volunteer airmen (5 men to a plane) he leads in the “Doolittle Raid.” The crew undergoes meticulous training, most notably learning how to take off in B-25s from runways no more than 500 feet (152 metres) in length to simulate the takeoffs that would be necessary from the USS Hornet on the day of the mission—the first time medium bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier. After striking Tokyo, Yokohama, and other cities on April 18, 1942, the airmen fly to recovery fields in China, a journey filled with peril. All but one plane runs out of fuel, leading most of the pilots to bail out or to crash-land in China or along its coast. The majority of the airmen are aided by local residents and returned to safety. However, one crew lands in Russia and is interned for a year, three airmen die attempting to reach China, and eight are captured by the Japanese, who later execute three of the men. All of the aircraft are destroyed. The crewmen depicted in the film include Corp. David Thatcher (Robert Walker), Lieut. Bob Gray (Robert Mitchum), and in particular Captain Lawson (Van Johnson), who survives the mission but loses a leg to amputation as a result of the injuries sustained in his crash landing.
Thirty Seconds over Tokyo is noted for its historical accuracy. Its use of actual war footage of the bombing (recorded during the mission) helped earn the film an Academy Award for special effects. Although the actual raid did little damage, it bolstered U.S. morale and caused the Japanese to shift precious resources to air defense.
