The Son of the Sheik,  American silent film, released in 1926, that was a sequel to the hit film The Sheik (1921), which gave actor Rudolph Valentino perhaps his most memorable role and ensured his status as a legendary heartthrob of Hollywood.
In the deserts of Algeria, Ahmed (played by Valentino) is captured and held for ransom by the evil father of the beautiful Yasmin (Vilma Banky). In retaliation, he kidnaps the girl, and an unexpected romance develops between them.
The symbolic images found in The Son of the Sheik are so important to film lore that the movie takes on a resonance that it may not otherwise deserve. The first film had cemented Valentino’s image as the exotic lover, and the second movie—one of the first high-profile film sequels—was designed to give audiences another opportunity to swoon over Valentino.  The follow-up was a more polished production than its predecessor and possessed tongue-in-cheek humour not found in the original.
The film took on a legendary status in a tragic and unexpected way: it was Valentino’s last screen appearance. He died from peritonitis at age 31 shortly after the film opened. More than 80,000 fans mobbed his funeral, proving that Valentino was larger than life even in death.
