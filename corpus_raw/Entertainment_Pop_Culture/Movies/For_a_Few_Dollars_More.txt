For a Few Dollars More, Italian Per qualche dollaro in più,  Italian western film, released in 1965, that was the second film in the popular Dollars series, director Sergio Leone’s “spaghetti western” trilogy that starred Clint Eastwood.
The Man with No Name (played by Eastwood) teams with another bounty hunter, Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), to infiltrate a gang of cutthroat thieves in order to steal their ill-gained fortune. Mortimer is motivated by personal reasons: he wants to avenge the rape and murder of his sister at the hands of the notorious bandit leader Indio (Gian Maria Volonté). In the climactic and prolonged showdown, Mortimer kills Indio, and he and the Man with No Name are the only survivors of the bloody battle.
After the surprising box-office success of A Fistful of Dollars (1964), Leone immediately made For a Few Dollars More, which many consider superior to the first. The sequel benefited from a stronger screenplay and an increased budget, which enabled Leone to cast Van Cleef opposite Eastwood; Van Cleef was a familiar character actor, but his role as a bounty hunter launched him to stardom. Eastwood’s character is referred to fleetingly as Monco, which is Spanish for “one-armed”—a reference to his always keeping his right hand on his gun. The last film in the Dollars series was The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), which is generally regarded as a masterpiece.
