The Invisible Man,  American horror film, released in 1933, that is considered one of the classics of that genre, especially noted for its groundbreaking visual effects and for featuring Claude Rains in his first American screen role.
Based on H.G. Wells’s science-fiction novel of the same name, The Invisible Man features Rains as Dr. Jack Griffin, a British scientist who has discovered the secret of invisibility and has taken the drug responsible for the incredible feat. The drug, however, also drives the doctor mad. He ends up terrorizing a quaint British village and eventually commits murder.
Rains’s impressive performance—in which he relied mainly on his vocal skills to emote, as he was invisible or covered with bandages throughout a good part of the film—made him a star. James Whale also drew praise for his deft direction. Although a horror film, The Invisible Man was noted for its humour.
