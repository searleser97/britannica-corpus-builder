Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,  American western film, released in 1969, that was a classic of the genre, especially noted for the pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the titular outlaws.
Butch Cassidy (played by Newman) and his companion in crime, the Sundance Kid (Redford), find that the ease they once enjoyed robbing banks and trains is rapidly coming to an end. Increasing security measures and bounties on their heads lead them—along with Sundance’s love interest, Etta Place (Katharine Ross)—to flee to Bolivia. Life there initially proves to be lucrative, even though neither outlaw knows Spanish. However, they soon face the same obstacles and persistent pressure from law enforcement that they had to endure in the United States. Their brief stint as payroll guards ends in violence, and the two men return to their lives of crime—with inevitably tragic results.
This revisionist western is loosely based on the real-life adventures of Butch and Sundance as they struggled to survive in a changing West. The film is noted for its exuberance and humour, with William Goldman’s Academy Award-winning script featuring numerous one-liners. Conrad Hall’s cinematography and Burt Bacharach’s classic score, both of which also earned Oscars, add to the timeless appeal of the film. In addition, the supporting cast was notable, and director George Roy Hill drew praise for skillfully blending standard action sequences with comedy. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was extremely popular at the box office, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1969. It made the teaming of Newman and Redford legendary, even though the two made only one more movie together, The Sting (1973), which was also directed by Hill.
