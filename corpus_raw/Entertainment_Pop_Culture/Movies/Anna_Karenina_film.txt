Anna Karenina,  American dramatic film, released in 1935, that was an adaptation of Leo Tolstoy’s classic novel of the same name. It featured Greta Garbo in one of her most acclaimed roles.
Set during the reign of Nicholas I, the film tells the story of Anna Karenina (played by Garbo), the frustrated and ignored wife of a straitlaced diplomat (played by Basil Rathbone). When a dashing nobleman, Vronsky (played by Fredric March), engages in an obsessive quest for her affection, Anna capitulates. Their affair unfolds in the rigid social atmosphere of titled 19th-century Russia, and, when Anna gives up her husband and son to be with her lover, she finds that there can be disastrous consequences for flouting societal mores.
Garbo had previously played Anna Karenina in the 1927 silent film Love. Featuring a happy ending that was a disastrous departure from the book’s actual conclusion, it was a rare box-office failure for Garbo. This MGM version, with high production values and a notable cast, was far more successful. Despite the numerous remakes of Tolstoy’s story that followed, the 1935 version continues to resonate because of its impressive performances.
