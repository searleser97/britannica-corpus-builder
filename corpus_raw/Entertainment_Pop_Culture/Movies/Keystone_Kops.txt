Keystone Kops,  an incredibly incompetent police force, dressed in ill-fitting, unkempt uniforms, that appeared regularly in Mack Sennett’s silent-film slapstick farces from about 1912 to the early 1920s. They became enshrined in American film history as genuine folk-art creations whose comic appeal was based on a native irreverence for authority.
What the Kops lacked in sense they made up for in zeal, as they dashed off to the chase on foot or drove off in a Tin Lizzie (one accommodated the entire force), in jerky, speeded-up tempo. Whether they collided with one another around corners or became entangled in clotheslines, ladders, or folding tents, their facial expressions of dour dignity never changed. Many of the great silent-film comedians, such as Roscoe (“Fatty”) Arbuckle, rose from the ranks of the Kops.
Named for Sennett’s Keystone Studios, the Kops were a basic corps of seven actors, with others moving in and out of the group. The first Keystone comedy with a cop force was At It Again (1912), in which they follow and arrest the wrong person. The Kops also appeared in The Man Next Door (1913) and had a central role in Bangville Police (1913), which is often cited as the first Keystone Kops film. All the movies were one- or two-reel short films. The Kops were typically comic bits added to movies rather than being integral to the plots.
Though the original Keystone Kops disappeared from movies with the arrival of the sound era, there were later revivals, including the short film Keystone Hotel (1935); Hollywood Cavalcade (1939), about the silent era; and Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops (1955).
