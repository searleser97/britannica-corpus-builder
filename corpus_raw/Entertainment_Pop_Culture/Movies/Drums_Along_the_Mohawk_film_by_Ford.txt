Drums Along the Mohawk,  American adventure film, released in 1939, that was based on the historical novel of the same name by Walter D. Edmonds.
The film, set during the American Revolution, follows a young couple, Gilbert and Lana Martin (played by Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert, respectively), as they begin married life together in a frontier community in the Mohawk Valley of central New York. Lana, a refined woman from Albany, initially struggles to adapt to the rustic conditions, but she soon helps her husband in working on their farm. When a band of Indians torches the farm, however, Mrs. McKlennar (Edna May Oliver), a wealthy widow, allows the Martins to move into a cabin she owns and to work on her land. Gilbert joins a militia of local men seeking to protect their property from the threat of Indian attacks and later becomes wounded in a skirmish. A period of peace follows, during which Lana gives birth to a son, though the area is eventually besieged by Indians once again. Under the command of the dastardly Caldwell (John Carradine), a Tory, the Indians attempt to take a local fort, but  Gilbert suddenly arrives with Continental Army troops who defeat the marauders.
Though masterly directed by John Ford and featuring stellar performances from its leads, Drums Along the Mohawk is often overlooked and underappreciated—in part because of the competition from other acclaimed films at the time of its release. (Many critics consider 1939 the greatest year in cinema history.) Although the film presents a simplified view of historical events, it benefits from the usual Fordian touches, with lively action, picturesque scenery, and stunning Technicolor production. Oliver is hilarious in her Academy Award-nominated role as the feisty pioneer widow who comes to the Martins’ rescue and who proves more dangerous than the Indian warriors who attack her.
