Hombre,  American western film, released in 1967, that was widely considered a classic of the genre. The revisionist western was the sixth and final movie that paired director Martin Ritt and star Paul Newman.
John Russell (played by Newman) is a young man raised by Apaches. He reluctantly leaves that world when he learns that he has inherited a boardinghouse. Russell has no interest in owning the home and sells it, thus displacing several boarders, including Jessie (Diane Cilento), the vivacious landlady. After completing the sale, Russell takes a stagecoach to Bisbee, Arizona. Other passengers include Jessie, Alexander Favor (Fredric March) and his wife (Barbara Rush), the station agent Henry Mendez (Martin Balsam), and a teenage married couple, Billy Lee (Peter Lazar) and Doris (Margaret Blye). A last-minute addition to the stage is Grimes (Richard Boone), a harsh man with a violent temper. En route, they are stopped by a gang of bandits who are in league with Grimes. The outlaws have targeted the stagecoach because they know that Favor, a federal official, has stolen government funds intended for the Apaches. After robbing the travelers, Grimes and his men leave, but Russell manages to kill several bandits, one of whom has the money. The passengers recover the cash but are stranded in the desert. The self-reliant Russell, although resentful toward white people, reluctantly agrees to help them. They find shelter but are soon tracked down by Grimes and his men, who want the money. The result is a final shoot-out with tragic consequences.
Hombre, based on an Elmore Leonard novel (1961), is a compelling and tense western, highlighted by strong performances. Newmanâ€™s portrayal of the antihero is particularly noteworthy, but the supporting cast is also impressive. Boone made Grimes a classic villain, and March was strong in a late-career performance. Newman and Ritt had earlier worked on such notable films as The Long, Hot Summer (1958) and Hud (1963).
