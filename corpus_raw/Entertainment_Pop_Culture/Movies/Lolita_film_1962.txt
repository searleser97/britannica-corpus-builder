Lolita,  American dark comedy film, released in 1962, that was Stanley Kubrick’s film adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov’s controversial novel of the same name.
In the film, eccentric middle-aged Humbert Humbert (played by James Mason) is driven to ruin because of his obsession with a sultry teenage girl, Lolita (Sue Lyon). His passion for her leads him to marry her lonely, sex-starved mother (Shelley Winters). Peter Sellers portrayed a pedophile whose competition with Humbert leads to disaster.
Kubrick hired Nabokov to author the screenplay but ended up rewriting most of it himself, though he allowed Nabokov to keep the screen credit (which earned him an Academy Award nomination). Moreover, censorship restrictions mandated that Kubrick raise the age of the title character from 12 to about 15 years old and feature nothing more overtly sexual than a pedicure in this “forbidden” relationship. Mason was highly praised for his performance as the uptight professor, and Winters also received great acclaim. The film was remade in 1997 with Jeremy Irons and Dominique Swain.
