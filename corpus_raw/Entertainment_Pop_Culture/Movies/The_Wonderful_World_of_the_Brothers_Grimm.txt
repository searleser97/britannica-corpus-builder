The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm,  American drama and fantasy film, released in 1962, that fictionalized the lives of famed German storytellers the Brothers Grimm. The film combined live action with segments of animation and was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning for best costume design.
The film traces the lives and careers of the Brothers Grimm (played by Laurence Harvey and Karlheinz Böhm) as their interest in fairy tales grows, interspersing their story with animated versions of several of their tales, including “Rumpelstiltskin,” “The Cobbler and the Elves,” and “The Singing Bone” (featuring Buddy Hackett).
Largely overlooked by today’s audiences, the movie was a high-profile production in its day, as it was the first of only two narrative films to be screened using Cinerama, a three-camera process that required a special projection system and a massive curved screen (an early forerunner of IMAX technology). The special effects are crude by modern standards, giving the movie a dated feel that nevertheless underscores its appealing sense of innocence. An acclaimed musical score, impressive European locations, and a star-studded cast, including Barbara Eden and Claire Bloom, add to the overall quality of the production.
