Khartoum,  British epic film, released in 1966, that was a big-budget, fact-based account of the Siege of Khartoum (1884–85), in which Gen. Charles Gordon led an unsuccessful defense of the Sudanese city against an army headed by the religious leader al-Mahdī.
The film opens as a British expeditionary force in the Sudan is slaughtered by the forces of al-Mahdī (played by Laurence Olivier), who is seeking to establish an Islamic state. British Prime Minister William Gladstone (Ralph Richardson) orders General Gordon (Charlton Heston) to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum to broker a deal with al-Mahdī that will allow civilians to be evacuated from the city. After al-Mahdī refuses, Gordon, a stubborn egotist looking for martyrdom, ignores Gladstone’s orders to return to London and instead stays on to fortify the city. Al-Mahdī launches a siege against Khartoum, and Gordon’s defenses initially prove to be impressive but are eventually overwhelmed. The general bravely confronts his attackers and is killed. Gordon’s death brings inevitable retaliation from England. British forces arrive shortly thereafter and ensure the fall of al-Mahdī’s reign.
Although a failure at the box office, Khartoum earned critical praise for its intelligent and entertaining retelling of the historical event. Heston gave one of his best performances as Gordon, and Olivier was mesmerizing as al-Mahdī. The production was also noted for its cinematography and Frank Cordell’s sweeping score.
