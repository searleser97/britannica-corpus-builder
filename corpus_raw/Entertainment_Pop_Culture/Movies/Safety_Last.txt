Safety Last!,  American silent film comedy, released in 1923, that was best known for its iconic image of comedian Harold Lloyd hanging from a clock atop a skyscraper.
Lloyd played an unnamed young man who poses as a department-store manager to impress his girlfriend. The plan soon goes awry, and he concocts an elaborate scheme to make his ruse appear true. The scheme mandates that Lloyd scale the side of a skyscraper as a “human fly” in the most precarious and hilarious death-defying situations imaginable. Lloyd performed many of the most dangerous stunts himself, despite having lost two fingers previously during a photography shoot in which he lit a bomb that he erroneously believed was a prop.
Long underrated in the pantheon of great screen comic actors, Lloyd has achieved new prominence in recent years with the influence of his films on such performers as the Hong Kong actor-director Jackie Chan. Lloyd’s influence on the silent film era was inestimable—owing in part to his ability to create comedy from physical danger—and no movie illustrates this talent more than Safety Last!
