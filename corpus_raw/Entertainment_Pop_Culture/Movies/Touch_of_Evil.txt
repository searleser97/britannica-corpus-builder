Touch of Evil,  American film noir, released in 1958, that was written and directed by Orson Welles, who also costarred in the crime drama. The film was a box-office disappointment, but in later years it was recognized as one of the final gems of the classic film noir period of the 1940s and ’50s.
Set in a sleazy town along the U.S.-Mexico border, Touch of Evil features a Mexican narcotics officer (played by Charlton Heston) whose honeymoon is interrupted by his sudden involvement in a murder case. In attempting to run his own investigations, he establishes a confrontational relationship with a crooked police captain (played by Welles) whose methods of enforcing the law often include breaking it. Heston’s new wife (played by Janet Leigh) finds herself a liability to her husband when she is kidnapped and framed by hoodlums working for Welles’s cop.
Welles had long been considered persona non grata by Hollywood studios when Universal agreed to hire him to direct as well as act in Touch of Evil, a decision reportedly made in an effort to coax Heston to join the project. The film turned out to be one of Welles’s greatest achievements, though originally it was edited against his wishes, reshot by the studio, and released as a B movie. In 1998, more than a decade after Welles’s death, a new version of the film was released, based on his notes Heston discovered on how the film should be cut. The movie is noted for its extended opening scene, considered one of the greatest long takes in film history, and for its strong supporting cast, with cameos by Marlene Dietrich, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Joseph Cotten, and Mercedes McCambridge. A memorable performance by Dennis Weaver as a mentally disturbed motel clerk was rumoured to have been the inspiration for the character of Norman Bates in Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho.
