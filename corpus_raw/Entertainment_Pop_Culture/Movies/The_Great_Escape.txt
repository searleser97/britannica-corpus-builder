The Great Escape,  American war film, released in 1963, that was loosely based on the true story of an ambitious escape by Allied prisoners of war during World War II. Widely considered a classic, the movie was especially known for the direction by John Sturges and for a  cast that included Steve McQueen in one of his defining roles.
The film’s central protagonists are American, British, and Australian POWs who are confined to a prison camp deep inside Nazi Germany. The Germans’ strategy is to keep their most problematic prisoners in one camp under close supervision, but their plan goes awry once the POWs begin plotting the most ambitious escape ever attempted. The mission is led by an officer known as “Big X” (played by Richard Attenborough), and key coconspirators include “The Cooler King” (McQueen), “The Manufacturer” (James Coburn), “The Scrounger” (James Garner), and “Tunnel King” (Charles Bronson). Under the supervision of Big X, several tunnels are dug; although one is discovered, the men continue with their plan. The escape itself is interrupted before all the prisoners can get outside the camp, and those who manage to break out are hunted by enemy forces, some 50 recaptured escapees being killed by the Gestapo.
The film was based on a book by the Australian writer Paul Brickhill but was altered significantly to accommodate the personalities of a cast that included several major stars and stars-to-be. Sturges made use of  German locations after having dissuaded studio executives from shooting the movie in California, and Elmer Bernstein provided one of the great film scores in cinema history. McQueen did most of his own motorcycling, though the famous stunt in which his character jumps a barbed-wire fence was performed by his friend Bud Ekins. The movie, despite its enduring legacy, was not without controversy, as British war veterans resented the inclusion of Americans in the Hollywood version of the escape, which was a solely British undertaking.
