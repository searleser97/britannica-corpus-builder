The Wild One,  American dramatic film, released in 1953, that was deemed scandalous for its day. Marlon Brando’s portrayal of a brooding biker in a black leather jacket helped launch both the film and an international interest in motorcycle gangs such as the Hell’s Angels.
The plot is loosely based on a 1947 incident in which the town of Hollister, California, was inundated by biker gangs. In the film, Brando and Lee Marvin played rival gang leaders Johnny and Chino, respectively. After Chino is arrested by a small-town sheriff (played by Robert Keith), his gang goes on a rampage. When Johnny is seen attempting to escort the sheriff’s daughter out of harm’s way, his actions are misconstrued by the enraged townspeople. Though he is eventually exonerated of any wrongdoing, the film does not offer a true happy ending.
The line of dialogue most cited from the film belongs to Brando. When his character is asked what he is rebelling against, he responds, “Whaddya got?”—thus expressing the angst of many young people eager to break free of the social conventions of the 1950s. This film marked the first time that movie audiences were exposed in any significant way to the existence of organized motorcycle gangs, and it spawned an entire genre based on the theme of the outlaw biker. By the time Roger Corman’s biker film The Wild Angels was released in 1966, three years before the legendary Easy Rider appeared, the amount of violence and sex depicted onscreen made The Wild One look tame. Yet it was deemed so dangerous in its day that England banned its showing until 1968, and it was cited by sociologists as a factor in the era’s spread of juvenile delinquency.
