Dumbo,  American animated musical film, released in 1941, that was produced by Walt Disney and was based on a children’s book of the same name written by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Pearl.
The film centres on Dumbo, a baby circus elephant who is constantly taunted by other animals because of his abnormally large ears. When a boy at the circus pulls on his ears, Dumbo’s protective mother spanks the child and, as a result, is separated from the rest of the animals. Still an outcast, Dumbo becomes friends with a mouse named Timothy, who persuades the ringmaster to showcase the young elephant in a circus act. Dumbo’s clumsiness causes the big top to collapse, however, and he is thereafter forced to perform with the clowns. One night, he and Timothy inadvertently become intoxicated on champagne, and the next morning Dumbo wakes up in a tree. Timothy realizes that Dumbo’s ears must have allowed him to fly. This newfound ability, coupled with a boost of self-confidence, allows Dumbo to become a hero in the circus and to reunite with his mother.
The story packs myriad emotions, from tragic sadness to triumphant joy, into 64 minutes, the shortest running time of any Disney feature film. The studio, RKO, was not happy with the abbreviated length and urged Disney either to insert additional scenes or to make trims and release Dumbo as a short. Disney held his ground, and the film (which cost under $1 million) went on to become a major critical and box-office success.
