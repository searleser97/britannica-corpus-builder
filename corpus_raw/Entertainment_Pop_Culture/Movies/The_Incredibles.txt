The Incredibles,  computer-animated motion picture, released in 2004, about a family of superheroes. It was a great critical and commercial success for Pixar Animation Studios.
The film was directed and written by Brad Bird, whose previous credits included the television show The Simpsons and the film The Iron Giant (1999). Craig T. Nelson provided the voice of Bob Parr, also known as the superhumanly strong Mr. Incredible, and Holly Hunter played his wife, Helen, who used her fantastic stretching powers to fight crime as Elastigirl. Samuel L. Jackson voiced Frozone, Mr. Incredible’s ice-powered friend and crime-fighting partner. Forced into retirement after a series of lawsuits made it too expensive to engage in superheroic behaviour, Bob and Helen live a mundane life in the suburbs with their children—Violet (who can turn invisible and generate protective force fields), Dash (who can move at superspeed), and Jack-Jack (an infant whose various powers are revealed during the film).
Having secretly reclaimed the mantle of Mr. Incredible, Bob is lured into a trap by Syndrome, a spurned would-be sidekick whose jealousy of heroes has turned him to a life of villainy. With assistance from her former allies in the superhero community, Helen—unaware that Violet and Dash have accompanied her—embarks on a mission to rescue Bob. Once reunited, the family defeats Syndrome, and a grateful public welcomes the return of costumed heroes. In 2005 The Incredibles won Academy Awards for best animated film and best sound editing. Most of the original cast returned for the film’s sequel Incredibles 2 (2018). Hunter’s Elastigirl took centre stage as a media-friendly hero tasked with making the world fall in love with superheroes again, while Nelson’s Mr. Incredible navigated the hazards of life as a stay-at-home father.
