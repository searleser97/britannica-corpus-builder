Ealing Studios, also called Associated Talking Pictures, Ltd.,  English motion-picture studio, internationally remembered for a series of witty comedies that reflected the social conditions of post-World War II Britain. Founded in 1929 by two of Englandâ€™s best known producers, Basil Dean and Reginald Baker, with the financial support of the Courtauld family, manufacturers of textiles, the company opened its own distribution outlet within two years and built the studios at Ealing near London. It produced several vaudeville-style musical comedies as well as serious feature films during the 1930s. It added information and propaganda films and short subjects for the British Ministry of Information during World War II and often infused a documentary-like realism into its films.
In the decade after the war, the studio became well known for its highly successful comedies, which dealt with the exploits of unconventional, antibureaucratic individuals in realistic settings. The first of these films was Passport to Pimlico (1949). Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) made Alec Guinness an international star and linked his name with the Ealing comedies. Whisky Galore (1949; U.S. title Tight Little Island) and The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) are other well-known productions in the Ealing style.
In 1944 the major portion of stock in the company had been sold to the Rank Organisation, Ltd., which controlled a large portion of the British film industry. The studio ceased production in 1955, and it was sold to the British Broadcasting Corporation.
