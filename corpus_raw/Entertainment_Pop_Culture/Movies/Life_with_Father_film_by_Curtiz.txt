Life with Father,  American comedy film, released in 1947, that was based on Clarence Day, Jr.’s best-selling autobiography (1935) of the same name.
The film chronicles Day’s childhood growing up in Victorian-era New York under the ironclad rule of his stern but loving father (played by William Powell). Although Clarence Day, Sr., sees himself as master of the household, a number of episodes prove otherwise, notably when his wife, Vinnie (Irene Dunne), persuades him to be baptized.
Day’s memoirs had earlier been adapted into a hugely successful Broadway play. Although the film version featured many predictable gags, it drew acclaim for its warmhearted story and fine performances, notably that by Powell, who earned an Academy Award nomination. The strong supporting cast included Elizabeth Taylor as a teenage houseguest. The book and film inspired a television series of the same name in the 1950s.
