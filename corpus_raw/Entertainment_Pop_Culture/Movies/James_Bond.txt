James Bond,  British literary and film character, a peerless spy, notorious womanizer, and masculine icon.
James Bond, designated Agent 007 (always articulated as “double-oh-seven”) in the British Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, was the creation of British novelist Ian Fleming, who introduced the character in his 1953 thriller Casino Royale. Bond was first conceived as a Cold War-era operative. Trained in intelligence and special forces, the superspy always used the latest gadgets, thwarted Soviet agents, brought international gangsters to justice, and inevitably bedded a beautiful woman. An enthusiastic gambler, he was nearly as loyal to his signature vodka martini as he was to the British crown and his Scottish roots. Although Bond radiated charisma and style, he was also intensely solitary and virtually friendless, despite his many trysts.
Fleming featured Bond in another 12 novels and additional short-story collections over the next 10 years. In 1962 the 007 novel Dr. No (1958) was adapted for film. Produced by Albert (“Cubby”) Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, it initiated one of the most successful movie franchises in history. After Fleming’s death, other writers continued producing new novels and original film stories in the series.
Bond was portrayed by several screen actors, including Sean Connery in the 1960s, Roger Moore in the ’70s and ’80s, and Pierce Brosnan in the ’90s, and Bond remained effectively ageless throughout those decades. However, as Daniel Craig took up the role with a new adaptation of Casino Royale (2006), the character’s history was formally restarted, establishing him definitively as a post-Cold War hero born in 1968. Beginning in the 1990s films, in response to changing social attitudes, Bond’s chauvinism was softened. The Broccoli family continues to hold the production rights on all Bond movie adaptations.
