Tarzan of the Apes,  American silent film, released in 1918, that was the first of many screen adaptations of Edgar Rice Burroughs’s legendary adventure novel Tarzan of the Apes (1912), about a young orphan raised to maturity by apes.
Burroughs’s novel was greatly condensed for this version, leaving the latter part of the book for a sequel (The Romance of Tarzan [1918]). In the film, Lord and Lady Greystoke are stranded on the coast of Africa after their ship has been hijacked by mutineers. Upon their deaths, their young son is raised by apes, allowing him to become the legendary “Lord of the Apes.”
Although critics rarely rate this film as a bona fide classic, the relevance of Tarzan of the Apes to motion picture history is substantial. Elmo Lincoln, who played the titular role, was already a veteran of many silent films, and although his physical appearance is unlike that of the musclemen actors, such as Johnny Weissmuller, who would later play the role, Lincoln helped establish the character of Tarzan as a timeless cinematic hero. This crudely made film was ironically the most faithful screen version of Burroughs’s novel until Hugh Hudson’s ambitious Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984).
