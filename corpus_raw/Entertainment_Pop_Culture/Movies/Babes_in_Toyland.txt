Babes in Toyland, also called March of the Wooden Soldiers,  American fantasy film, released in 1934, that starred the comedy team of Laurel and Hardy in an enduring holiday classic.
The film—which was based on a 1903 operetta by composer Victor Herbert and librettist Glen MacDonough—is set in Toyland, where Mother Goose, Little Bo Peep, and other well-known fairy-tale characters reside. In order to save Little Bo-Peep from an unwanted marriage, Stannie Dum (played by Stan Laurel) and Ollie Dee (Oliver Hardy) trick her unwanted suitor, the evil Silas Barnaby (Henry Kleinbach), into marrying Dum. Barnaby and his henchmen retaliate by setting bogeymen on the land, and an army of full-sized wooden soldiers comes to the rescue. Ample screen time is given to a romance between Tom-Tom Piper and Little Bo Peep, portrayed by Felix Knight and Charlotte Henry, respectively.
Babes in Toyland was a nontraditional Laurel and Hardy vehicle in that it featured the duo as supporting players rather than leads. It was rereleased in 1952 under the title March of the Wooden Soldiers. Considered to be among Laurel and Hardy’s best films, it became a holiday staple with frequent television airings.
