The Ghost and Mr. Chicken,  American screwball comedy, released in 1966, that was Don Knotts’s first feature film after he left the hit television program The Andy Griffith Show.
Knotts played nervous Luther Heggs, a newspaper typesetter who, in the hope of being promoted to reporter, agrees to spend a night in an allegedly haunted house, where 20 years earlier a husband had killed his wife and then himself. Though  a relative of the couple sues Heggs for libel for confirming the ghost stories, Heggs inadvertently solves the mystery surrounding the  “haunting” and uncovers the truth about the deaths, becoming a hero in the process.
Knotts had only recently left his Emmy Award-winning role as Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show when Universal mogul Lew Wasserman signed him to a multipicture deal. Knotts enlisted the writers and many cast members from the TV show to work on the film, and the script was actually cowritten by Andy Griffith, who declined to take screen credit. The script plays on Knotts’s popular image as a lovable bumbler, and Vic Mizzy’s distinctive music led to a release of the sound track almost 40 years later. The movie was a box-office hit.
