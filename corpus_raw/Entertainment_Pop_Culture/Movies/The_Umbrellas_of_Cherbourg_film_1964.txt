The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, French Les Parapluies de Cherbourg,  French musical film, released in 1964, that is unusual in that literally all of the dialogue in the movie—from mundane conversations to emotional confrontations—is sung.
Director-writer Jacques Demy dared to present a rather poignant and melancholy story in musical format, relating the tale of a torrid love affair between a teenage girl (played by Catherine Deneuve) and a young auto mechanic (Nino Castelnuovo) in Cherbourg, France, whose lives are dramatically torn apart when he is drafted to serve in the Algerian War.
The cast is as charming as Michel Legrand’s lush, jazzy score, with 20-year-old Deneuve radiating an almost surrealistic beauty. The songs include the grandly romantic “I Will Wait for You,” which has since become a classic, and the music is complemented by an eye-poppingly vibrant colour palette in the film’s costumes and decor. Though the film was celebrated upon its release, winning the grand prize at the 1964 Cannes film festival, the master prints had been in a state of deterioration until Demy’s widow, Agnès Varda, completed a major restoration of the film in 1992. In 1967 Demy reunited with Deneuve and Legrand for a similarly themed musical, The Young Girls of Rochefort, which featured an appearance by Gene Kelly.
