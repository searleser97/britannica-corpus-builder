The Grapes of Wrath,  American film, released in 1940, that is John Ford’s acclaimed adaptation of John Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the Great Depression.
The Grapes of Wrath centres on the Joad family, hardworking farmers who have lost everything in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in the 1930s. Seeking better opportunities, they decide to make the arduous trek to California. Their situation, however, fails to improve as the Joads struggle to find work.
