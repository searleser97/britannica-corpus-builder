A Face in the Crowd,  American film drama, released in 1957, that was especially noted for the performance by Andy Griffith in his movie debut.
Griffith portrayed the charismatic, but manipulative, country singer Larry (“Lonesome”) Rhodes, who is idolized by the very masses he disdains in private. Patricia Neal and Lee Remick (also in her film debut) are among the women he uses and discards. The film builds to a shattering conclusion when Rhodes’s true feelings are revealed to his fans.
A Face in the Crowd reteamed screenwriter Budd Schulberg and director Elia Kazan, who both worked on the award-winning On the Waterfront (1954). Although the film was not a box-office success, its critical acclaim grew in the ensuing years. Griffith later became known for his work in light comedies, but A Face in the Crowd proved that he was also adept at drama.
