On the Beach,  American dramatic film, released in 1959, that was set in the aftermath of an imagined World War III. It was based on the apocalyptic novel of the same name by Nevil Shute.
The fatal fallout of nuclear war in the year 1964 serves as the fictional backdrop for romance between a navy captain (played by Gregory Peck) and a cynical Australian party girl (Ava Gardner). Peck’s character is head of a U.S. submarine crew who have retreated to Australia, the only part of the world that has not yet been decimated by slow-moving radioactive winds. The captain’s affair with Gardner’s character is desperate and bittersweet, as they await inevitable death alongside a group of other doomed survivors.
The release of the film at the height of the Cold War spurred heated political debates. Liberals embraced its pacifist message, while conservatives dismissed its plea for nuclear disarmament as hopelessly naïve. On the Beach features haunting scenes, including the submarine’s eerie return to California to trace unexplained telegraph signals and the dispersal of suicide pills to survivors who choose not to wait for death by radiation sickness. The performances were widely praised and include Fred Astaire in his first dramatic role. Ernest Gold’s score, which offered frequent nods to the Australian ballad “Waltzing Matilda,” earned an Academy Award nomination and is integral to the emotional impact of the film’s final scenes.
