Kind Hearts and Coronets,  British comedy, released in 1949, that came to be recognized as one of the best British films of all time. It was noted for its dark humour and for the performance of Alec Guinness, who played eight characters.
Ruthlessly ambitious aristocrat Louis Mazzini (played by Dennis Price) seeks to avenge his mother, disowned by her family for marrying below her station, by gaining the dukedom of her distant dead relative. In order to do so, he systematically murders each of the individuals standing in his way in the line of succession—excepting those who conveniently die without his help. These relatives, seven men and one woman, are all played by Guinness, and each dies in an unusual, darkly comic way. Mazzini finds his mission compromised, however, when his romantic dalliance with the widow of one of his victims causes his former lover to launch a plot of her own.
The macabre black comedy was praised in particular for the multicast Guinness, whose virtuosic performance helped to elevate him from supporting player to full-fledged leading man. The version released in the United States was edited for adherence to the Production Code then in effect; most notably, the ending of the American version differed from the ambiguous original in that it assured audiences that Mazzini would pay for his crimes. The film’s title is taken from a line from Alfred Tennyson’s poem “Lady Clara Vere de Vere”: “Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood.”
