The Set-Up,  American film noir, released in 1949, that was noted for its indictment of crime’s influence in boxing and for playing out in real time.
The Set-Up is a gritty drama centring on washed-up boxer Bill (“Stoker”) Thompson (played by Robert Ryan). Thompson’s attempt at a comeback is undermined by his own manager and trainer, who secretly accept a gambler’s bribe for him to throw his next fight. During the bout, Stoker is told about the deal, but he refuses to lose.
Director Robert Wise captured the unsavoury underbelly of the boxing world and its inextricable link with the criminal element. The film provided an early lead role for Ryan, who called upon his experience as a boxing champ at Dartmouth College to add realism to the fight sequences. The film was shot on an expedited schedule of only 20 days.
