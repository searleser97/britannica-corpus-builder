The Hound of the Baskervilles,  American mystery-detective film, released in 1939, that was adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic novel of the same name. It is noted for Basil Rathbone’s debut as Sherlock Holmes, a role that would define his career.
Victorian-era detective Holmes and his assistant, Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce), are called to Baskerville Hall in the mist-covered moors of Dartmoor in southern England. A giant spectral hound reportedly stalks the premises and kills the estate’s heirs out of vengeance for the death of a local peasant girl. The sleuths hope to protect Sir Henry Baskerville (Richard Greene), the estate’s latest heir and last in the line of Baskervilles, from falling prey to the same curse that has killed his predecessors. Pretending to leave Baskerville Hall, Holmes springs a trap and catches the real culprit: not a murderous beast but a beastly neighbour, John Stapleton, a distant cousin of Baskerville who hoped to inherit the estate and the estate’s fortune.
Rathbone received second billing to Richard Greene, an indication that Twentieth Century-Fox did not immediately recognize the potential for a lucrative series of Sherlock Holmes tales starring Rathbone and Bruce. However, the two actors went on to make more than a dozen Holmes films together. Their performances were widely hailed by critics and they became known to many as the definitive Holmes and Watson duo.
