Sunset Boulevard,  American film noir, released in 1950, that is often cited as one of Hollywood’s greatest films, especially noted for Gloria Swanson’s portrayal of a fading movie star. The movie is named after the iconic street that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, Calif.
A sharp critique of the film industry, Sunset Boulevard centres on the delusional aging silent-film queen Norma Desmond (played by Swanson), who lives in a ramshackle mansion with her butler and former husband (Erich von Stroheim) while planning a doomed comeback. When Desmond takes on frustrated young screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) as her lover, his attraction to a younger woman and his disgust with his own inability to leave the pampered life Desmond offers him culminates in murder.
With Sunset Boulevard, Swanson, a real-life silent-screen star, actually made a comeback, something her character is unable to achieve. Although Swanson was only 50 years old at the time, she was made to appear much older in the film. Her striking appearance and dramatic delivery, Holden’s much-acclaimed performance as her ambivalent gigolo, and the performance of famed German silent-film director Stroheim all contribute to the film’s status as a masterpiece of cinema. Also noteworthy is the direction by Billy Wilder, who cowrote the script. Director Cecil B. DeMille, who frequently worked with Swanson in her heyday, appears as himself in the film.
