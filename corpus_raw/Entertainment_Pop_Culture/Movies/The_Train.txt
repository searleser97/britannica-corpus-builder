The Train,  American war film, released in 1964, that is an exciting and intelligent thriller set during World War II. It is noted for John Frankenheimer’s direction and for strong performances by a cast that included Paul Scofield and Burt Lancaster.
The film opens in the closing days of the war, as German Colonel von Waldheim (played by Scofield) is ordered to collect artwork from a French museum and take it by train to Germany. The museum curator (Suzanne Flon) notifies the Resistance, and Labiche (Lancaster), a railroad inspector, is approached to help thwart the plan. More intent on protecting lives, he initially refuses but is finally persuaded to join the effort, thanks in large part to his conversations with a widowed hotel owner (Jeanne Moreau). Through an elaborate scheme, the artwork is ultimately saved, and von Waldheim is killed by Labiche.
The Train features thrilling action sequences, capped by a colossal train wreck; remarkably, none of the scenes were filmed using miniatures. The on-screen drama was nearly matched by the turmoil behind the scenes. Arthur Penn was originally hired to direct, but his vision of the film—which was more esoteric and pertained to how the French love of art influenced the protagonists in the story—led to disagreements with Lancaster, who was keenly aware of his audience’s expectations for an action film. Shortly after shooting began, Penn was replaced by Frankenheimer, who had just worked with Lancaster on Seven Days in May (1964). The troubles on the set and Frankenheimer’s insistence upon shooting expensive action sequences almost doubled the budget. Despite such difficulties, the film is widely regarded as one of the most innovative and intelligent war movies of its era.
