Cape Fear,  American thriller film, released in 1962, that was a suspenseful tale of revenge, especially noted for Robert Mitchum’s chilling performance.
Gregory Peck portrayed Sam Bowden, a defense attorney who, along with his family, is terrorized by a man he once prosecuted and sent to jail, the sadistic ex-convict Max Cady (played by Mitchum). Bowden and Cady match wits throughout the film before their final showdown on an isolated houseboat in Cape Fear, North Carolina.
Cape Fear, which was directed by J. Lee Thompson, features a number of elements associated with Alfred Hitchcock’s movies: unusual lighting angles and close-ups, eerie music, and scenes in which violence is hinted at instead of graphically portrayed. The sexual menace at the heart of Mitchum’s character, especially the threat of raping a minor—at one point Cady says, “I got somethin’ planned for your wife and kid they ain’t never gonna forget”—was daring to depict in its day, leading to problems with censors and the removal of the word rape from the script. The film was remade in 1991 by Martin Scorsese with Robert De Niro and Nick Nolte as Cady and Bowden, respectively. The remake also featured cameos by original cast members Peck, Mitchum, and Martin Balsam. Scorsese retained the chilling original score by Academy Award-winning composer Bernard Herrmann, whose many credits include scores for Citizen Kane (1941), Vertigo (1958), Psycho (1960), and Taxi Driver (1976).
