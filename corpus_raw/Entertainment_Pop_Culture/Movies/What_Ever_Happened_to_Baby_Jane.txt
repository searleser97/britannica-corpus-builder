What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,  American psychological thriller film, released in 1962, that was a late-career triumph for both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.
Baby Jane Hudson (played by Davis) is a former child star of the vaudeville era whose fame was so widespread that there was even a “Baby Jane” doll made in her likeness. Her older sister, Blanche (Crawford), watched with envy as their father doted on Jane and spoiled her with toys and attention. Years later, in the 1930s, both sisters are actresses—but the roles have switched. Blanche is now the more successful of the two sisters, which has left Jane bitter and jealous. After a suspicious automobile accident leaves Blanche confined to a wheelchair, Jane spends her subsequent years giving reluctant care to her disabled sister. As Jane descends into madness, Blanche becomes her prisoner and is subject to various psychological tortures.
When the pairing of fading superstars Davis and Crawford was suggested to studio mogul Jack Warner, he allegedly replied, “I wouldn’t give a plugged nickel for either of those two old broads.” However, under Robert Aldrich’s direction, the aging actresses revitalized their careers with this gothic suspense tale. They gave remarkable performances, though their real-life feud often interfered with production and even led to excessively violent scenes that at one point left Crawford with stitches in her head after being kicked by Davis. Crawford was furious when Davis, and not she, was subsequently nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in the film. Victor Buono was also nominated, for his portrayal of an accompanist taking advantage of Jane’s delusions of renewed stardom.
