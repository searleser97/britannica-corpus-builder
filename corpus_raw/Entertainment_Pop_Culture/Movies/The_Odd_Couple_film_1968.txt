The Odd Couple,  American comedy film, released in 1968, that was an adaptation of Neil Simon’s hit Broadway play, which popularized the comedic conceit of badly matched housemates.
After neurotic neat freak Felix Ungar (played by Jack Lemmon) is kicked out of his house by his frustrated wife, he moves in with his old friend, sportswriter Oscar Madison (played by Walter Matthau). Oscar’s slovenly habits go head-to-head with Felix’s obsessive-compulsive cleanliness, making for instant comedic conflict.
The play starred Matthau opposite Art Carney, who portrayed Felix. Carney, however, was passed over for the film version in favour of Lemmon and his more impressive box-office appeal. Lemmon and Matthau’s real-life friendship contributed to their onscreen chemistry, which won praise from critics and audiences alike. Simon added several scenes to the film that would have been difficult to depict onstage, including one in which Oscar attends a Mets baseball game at Shea Stadium. The Odd Couple also benefited from a solid cast of supporting actors and from Neal Hefti’s catchy theme song, which became a classic in its own right. A highly successful TV series based on the film aired in the 1970s, starring Tony Randall as Felix and Jack Klugman as Oscar.
