Attack!,  American war film, released in 1956, that was considered groundbreaking for its exploration of cowardice and nepotism in the U.S. military.
The film, set in the European theatre during World War II, follows an American platoon that must contend with both a superior German force and the incompetence of its own leader, the cowardly Capt. Erskine Cooney (played by Eddie Albert). Although Cooney’s weaknesses as an officer are widely known—especially by his second-in-command, Lieut. Joe Costa (Jack Palance)—he is kept in charge by Lieut. Col. Clyde Bartlett (Lee Marvin), who hopes to curry favour with Cooney’s influential father after the war. When Cooney refuses to reinforce Costa’s squad in a seemingly hopeless situation, the lieutenant becomes obsessed with exacting his own revenge against his superior officer.
The gritty and realistic drama was based on Norman Brook’s play The Fragile Fox. Stellar performances were given by Palance and Albert, who was, ironically, a decorated war hero in real life. The U.S. Army was so disturbed by the nature of the film that it refused to provide equipment or support, forcing director Robert Aldrich to be innovative with his scarce resources.
