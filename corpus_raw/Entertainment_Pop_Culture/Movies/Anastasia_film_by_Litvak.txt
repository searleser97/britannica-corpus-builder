Anastasia,  American film drama, released in 1956, that is especially noted for Ingrid Bergman’s Academy Award-winning performance.
The film involves a con man (played by Yul Brynner) who concocts an outlandish plot to pass off a beautiful amnesiac (Bergman) as Anastasia, the daughter of Nicholas II who was long rumoured to have survived the execution squad that murdered the other members of the Russian emperor’s family in 1917. The woman becomes so convincing that Brynner begins to suspect that she may really be Anastasia, even as he begins to fall in love with her.
Anastasia marked the Hollywood comeback of Bergman, who had been forced to return to Europe when her extramarital affair with director Roberto Rossellini sparked a scandal. In addition to Bergman’s poignant performance, the film was noted for Helen Hayes’s portrayal of Anastasia’s skeptical grandmother. Anastasia was based on Marcelle Maurette’s popular Broadway play.
