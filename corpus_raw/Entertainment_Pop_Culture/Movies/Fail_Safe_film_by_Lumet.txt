Fail Safe,  American thriller film, released in 1964, that centres on an accidental nuclear attack during the Cold War. Director Sidney Lumet shot the black-and-white movie in a minimalist, claustrophobic, documentary style and without a musical score to heighten the tension.
Fail Safe revolves around the inability of the United States to recall a squadron of nuclear-armed bombers inadvertently ordered to attack Moscow. The U.S. president (played by Henry Fonda) desperately tries to convince the Soviets that the attack is a mistake. In order to prevent an all-out nuclear war, the president states that he will order bombs to be dropped on New York City if Moscow is indeed attacked. Although the Soviets shoot down a number of the U.S. planes, one manages to drop its nuclear bombs. In response, the president follows through on his promise.
Stanley Kubrick was so concerned that the similar plot line of Fail Safe would undermine his satire Dr. Strangelove that he had Columbia buy the distribution rights to the Lumet film and delay the film until after the release of his movie. The result was that Fail Safe was a critical success but a box-office failure. The novel Fail-Safe (by Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler), in fact, so closely paralleled the novel Red Alert, on which Kubrickâ€™s Dr. Strangelove was based, that its author, Peter George, filed a plagiarism suit, which was settled out of court. In 2000 George Clooney starred in a television adaptation of Fail-Safe, which aired live.
