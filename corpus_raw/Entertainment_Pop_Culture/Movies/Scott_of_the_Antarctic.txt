Scott of the Antarctic,  British adventure film, released in 1948, that chronicles the legendary ill-fated South Pole expedition (1910–12) of British explorer Robert Falcon Scott.
Scott (played by John Mills) organizes an expedition to Antarctica for the purpose of being the first to reach the South Pole. After enduring a series of setbacks from the harsh elements, he and his team of five finally reach their destination only to find the Norwegian flag—explorer Roald Amundsen had beat them to their goal. Dejected, Scott and his team begin the long return journey to their camp. Battling treacherous weather and exhaustion, Scott and his men perish on the ice, the last of them dying just 11 miles (18 km) from a supply depot.
The movie is faithful to the actual events of Scott’s expedition; the screenwriters consulted Scott’s diary in writing the script. Ralph Vaughan Williams, who composed the film’s score, used the music as inspiration for his Sinfonia Antartica.
