To Kill a Mockingbird,  American dramatic film, released in 1962, that was adapted from Harper Lee’s coming-of-age novel that addressed racism and injustice. The movie is widely regarded as an American classic.
To Kill a Mockingbird recounts the childhood experiences of six-year-old “Scout” Finch (played by Mary Badham) during the Great Depression in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. When her widowed father (Gregory Peck), a principled and respected attorney, defends a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, Scout and her brother witness the horrors of racism. They also learn valuable lessons about courage, compassion, tolerance, and prejudice.
Peck’s Academy Award-winning performance as Atticus Finch became an enduring part of cinema history; in 2003 his character was voted the top film hero in a poll conducted by the American Film Institute. Badham, as the tomboyish Scout, earned praise in her first screen role. Scout’s friend, the imaginative, storytelling “Dill,” was patterned after Lee’s childhood friend, the writer Truman Capote. Robert Duvall made his film debut as “Boo” Radley, a reclusive neighbour.
