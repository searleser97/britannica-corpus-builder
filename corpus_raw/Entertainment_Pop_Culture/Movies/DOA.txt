D.O.A.,  American film noir, released in 1950, that was noted for its ingenious plot.
Tax accountant Frank Bigelow (played by Edmond O’Brien) walks into a police station to report his own murder. A few days earlier, he had left his girlfriend for a weekend of relaxation in San Francisco. While in a jazz club, someone switches his drink. The next day Bigelow discovers that he has been inexplicably poisoned with a slow-working toxin certain to kill him within two days. He then goes on a relentless manhunt to try to solve the mystery of who might want him dead. Although Bigelow eventually tracks down the culprit, he is unable to prevent his own murder.
D.O.A. is an emblematic film noir with much of the film told in flashback and a protagonist who cannot escape his doom. The jazz club where Bigelow is poisoned is one of the earliest screen depictions of the budding Beat movement of the 1950s. Prior to directing D.O.A., Rudolph Maté had a long career as a cinematographer, working on such films as La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc (1928).
