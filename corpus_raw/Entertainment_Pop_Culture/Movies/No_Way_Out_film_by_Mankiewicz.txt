No Way Out,  American film noir, released in 1950, that was among the first movies to deal directly with racism. It features the memorable film debut of Sidney Poitier.
The taut narrative focuses on Ray Biddle (played by Richard Widmark), a bigoted white small-time crook who accuses an African American doctor, Luther Brooks (Poitier), of intentionally killing his brother Johnny while both brothers were being treated for gunshot wounds following an attempted robbery. Brooks claims that Johnny’s death was the inadvertent result of a spinal tap he had administered to treat what he believed was an undiagnosed brain tumour, and he requests an autopsy to quell both Biddle’s rage and his own self-doubt. The hospital administration, however, denies the request, not wanting to draw undue attention to the case. As word spreads among both the black and white communities in town, a race riot erupts. Eventually, Brooks decides to turn himself in to the police in order to force an autopsy to be performed, and the coroner’s findings exonerate him hours later. Meanwhile, however, Biddle escapes police custody and concocts a scheme to lure Brooks to his death. Arriving at the house of his mentor, who he believes wants to see him, Brooks instead finds an armed Biddle, but Johnny’s ex-wife (Linda Darnell) shows up soon after and prevents the murder.
No Way Out provided early career highlights for Widmark, whose visceral portrayal of a spiteful criminal built upon his acclaimed performance in Kiss of Death, and for Poitier, who at age 22 brought dignity and passion to the groundbreaking role. Real-life husband and wife Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee appear in early uncredited roles as relatives of Brooks. Owing to the film’s controversial nature and its candid use of racist language, some U.S. theatres aired only edited prints of the movie, while others in the Deep South refused to show the film at all.
