The Gunfighter,  American western film, released in 1950, that is credited with introducing the “psychological western,” a subgenre that favoured character studies over action.
Jimmy Ringo (played by Gregory Peck) is haunted by his unwanted reputation as the fastest gunslinger in the West. A peace-loving man, he tries to avoid conflict at all costs but constantly has to defend himself against young upstarts. With every gunfight he wins, Jimmy’s reputation grows, and he must lead a nomadic life in order to minimize confrontations. He arrives in a small town hoping to reconcile with his estranged wife and young son. However, word leaks out about his presence, and more violence and challenges to his status as the top gunman result. Eventually, Jimmy is ambushed by a young man and fatally shot. With his dying words, Jimmy warns his killer that he will now face the same kind of miserable existence Jimmy had to endure, with an endless number of other young guns looking to be known as the killer of the man who killed Jimmy Ringo.
The Gunfighter was written for John Wayne. However, the script was originally purchased by Columbia Pictures, and Wayne refused to work for the studio because of his dislike of its president, Harry Cohn. (Wayne would masterfully play a similar role in his last film, The Shootist [1976].) The script was later sold to Twentieth Century-Fox, and Peck was cast in the lead. He earned great acclaim as the haunted gunslinger who is resigned to his fate. The Gunfighter was also noted for its intelligent script and fine direction by Henry King. Although the film was a box-office disappointment, it helped launch a wave of psychological westerns, which would include such other classics as High Noon (1952).
