Riot in Cell Block 11,  American low-budget crime film, released in 1954, that offers a critical look at the prison system in the United States. It was inspired by a real-life Hollywood incident.
A group of convicts—led by James Dunn (played by Neville Brand) and Crazy Mike Carnie (Leo Gordon)—stage a riot and take hostages, demanding various prison reforms. Although the sympathetic warden (Emile Meyer) agrees with their complaints, politicians refuse to support the changes. As riots are threatened elsewhere in the prison, the unstable Carnie encourages further violence, which both Dunn and the warden struggle to prevent.
The plot stemmed from a shooting involving producers Walter Wanger and Jennings Lang. In 1951 Wanger suspected Lang of having an affair with his wife, Joan Bennett, and shot him. Lang survived and went on to produce a number of hit films, and Wanger served four months in prison, where he was appalled by the horrendous conditions. Upon his release, he teamed with director Don Siegel to make the first realistic look at the inhumanity found in modern prisons. The crew received permission to shoot at California’s Folsom Prison and utilized both prisoners and guards as extras and technical advisers. The film was an enormous box-office success and received strong reviews from critics who cited it as one of the top films of the genre. Future director Sam Peckinpah was an uncredited production assistant on the film.
