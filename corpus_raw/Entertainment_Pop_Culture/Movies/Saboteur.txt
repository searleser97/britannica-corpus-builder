Saboteur,  American spy film, released in 1942, that was one of director Alfred Hitchcock’s notable thrillers, especially known for its climactic sequence atop the Statue of Liberty.
Barry Kane (played by Robert Cummings), a worker at an aircraft factory in California, is framed for an act of sabotage that killed his friend. When authorities refuse to believe his story that the real culprit is a German spy going by the name of Frank Fry (Norman Lloyd), Kane escapes from police custody. He undertakes a cross-country chase to catch Fry, and along the way he is joined by a young woman named Pat Martin (Priscilla Lane). As they pursue the saboteur, the couple are shocked to find that respected citizens and police officers are part of the conspiracy. Kane learns that Fry intends to destroy U.S. naval vessels at a shipyard in Brooklyn, New York, and he arrives in time to prevent Fry from detonating a bomb. However, the culprit escapes when Kane is taken into custody. Martin valiantly tails Fry to Liberty Island and calls the FBI. After arriving on the island with an FBI agent, Kane manages to break free, and he confronts Fry in a dizzying battle atop the Statue of Liberty. Fry falls over a railing but manages to grab hold of the statue, but his hand slips, and Kane grabs him by the sleeve of his jacket. Fry ultimately falls to his death when the sleeve rips.
Saboteur was considered especially timely, given its release shortly after the United States entered World War II. The film’s central plot—about German infiltration of sensitive American industries—hit a nerve with audiences, who were paranoid about spies. In addition to numerous suspenseful sequences, the film was noted for an entertaining script cowritten by Dorothy Parker. Although Hitchcock had wanted to cast Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck in the lead roles, Universal instead selected Cummings and Lane.
