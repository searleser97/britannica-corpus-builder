The Night of the Hunter,  American crime thriller, released in 1955, that is regarded as a masterpiece of tone and suspense. Its screenplay was cowritten by Charles Laughton and James Agee, and it was the only directorial effort by Laughton.
Surrealistic in style, the story concerns two young children trying to flee their murderous stepfather, a crazed self-appointed preacher, conman, and former prisoner played by Robert Mitchum in one of the finest performances of his career. His character, one of film’s great villains, marries the children’s mother (played by Shelley Winters) in the belief that she or her children know the whereabouts of a large stash of money, and he stops at nothing in his attempts to pry this knowledge out of them. Famously, the violent preacher has the word Love tattooed on the knuckles of one hand, and Hate tattooed on the other.
The Night of the Hunter, which was based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Davis Grubb, is best remembered for its powerful performances and for the eerie, atmospheric cinematography of Stanley Cortez. At its centre is an anomalously peaceful scene in which the children travel by boat down a nighttime river. It is filmed with a piercingly lovely fairy-tale quality that heightens the film’s already larger-than-life battle of innocence versus evil. Former silent-screen star Lillian Gish plays the elderly woman who serves as the children’s protector by the movie’s end. Though it was a box-office flop in its day, The Night of the Hunter is now widely considered a classic in the crime-thriller genre.
