Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,  American romantic comedy film, released in 1948, that offered a humorous look at the frustrations of owning a home.
Cary Grant and Myrna Loy played a Manhattan couple who, tired of city life, decide to build a house in the country. The process, however, is marred by numerous problems, including cost overruns and shoddy workmanship. Grant’s character, a harried ad executive, discovers his dream home is more like a nightmare, all while having to deal with a hellish commute. The situation is further complicated by troubles at work and his suspicion that his wife is having an affair with his best friend (played by Melvyn Douglas).
Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, which was adapted from Eric Hodgins’s popular novel of the same name, was timely, given the post-World War II housing-construction boom. To promote the film, the studio built 73 exact replicas of Mr. Blandings’s “Dream House” across the country, which they sold or gave away in raffles. Mr. Blandings inspired numerous films, including the 1986 comedy The Money Pit, which starred Tom Hanks.
