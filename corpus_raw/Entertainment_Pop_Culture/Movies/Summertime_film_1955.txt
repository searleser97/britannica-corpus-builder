Summertime,  American film drama, released in 1955, featuring Katharine Hepburn in a timeless love story set in Venice.
Director David Lean’s simple film—adapted from the play The Time of the Cuckoo by Arthur Laurents—centres on a spinster (played by Hepburn) who is taking her dream trip to Venice, accompanied only by her omnipresent movie camera. A chance encounter with a suave local man (played by Rossano Brazzi) leads to a budding romance and some unexpected complications when she discovers he is married.
Lean filmed the entire movie on location, foregoing studio shots for the actual grandeur of Venice. The location adds immeasurably to the atmosphere of what is actually a very modest story. Hepburn won outstanding reviews as the vulnerable, lonely woman who at first resists her romantic impulses only to succumb to them and enjoy life for the first time. The film is also noted for the cinematography of Jack Hildyard. Summertime was released in the United Kingdom under the title Summer Madness.
