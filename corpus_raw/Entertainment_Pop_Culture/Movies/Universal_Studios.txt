Universal Studios,  American motion-picture studio that was one of the leading producers of film serials in the 1920s and of popular horror films in the ’30s. Carl Laemmle, a film exhibitor turned producer, formed the company in 1912. In its early days it was a top producer of popular low-budget serials and also presented many of the films of Erich von Stroheim (1885–1957), who was a pioneer in realistic film direction.
For many years after the award-winning film All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), the studio presented its characteristic low-budget films, which included the well-known horror films Frankenstein (1931) and Dracula (1931). In the 1960s it regained much box-office success through the comedies of Doris Day and Rock Hudson. It was known as Universal-International for a time and in the early 1970s it was purchased by the Music Corporation of America, which turned it into the largest and most profitable packager of films for television in the world. Universal was subsequently involved in a series of acquisitions, and in 2004 the company (as part of Vivendi Universal Entertainment) merged with the National Broadcasting Co., Inc., to form NBC Universal.
Universal Studios opened a number of theme parks that highlight its movie and television productions. In addition to being a working studio, Universal Studios Hollywood includes rides and attractions and offers tours of various television and film sets. It was damaged by fires in 1990 and 2008; the latter destroyed two square blocks of the studio lot as well as its popular King Kong attraction. Universal Orlando Resort in Florida features the Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure theme parks. The latter includes the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, an attraction based on J.K. Rowling’s popular book series. Other Universal Studios theme parks are located in Ōsaka, Japan, and in Singapore.
