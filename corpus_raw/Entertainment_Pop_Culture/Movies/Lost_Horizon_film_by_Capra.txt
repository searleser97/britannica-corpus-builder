Lost Horizon,  American fantasy film, released in 1937, that was directed by Frank Capra and based on James Hilton’s 1933 novel of the same name. The fictional land of Shangri-La, where the film is set, became a common reference for an earthly paradise.
Ronald Colman played Robert Conway, a British diplomat who, along with a group of eclectic fellow passengers, is on an airplane that is highjacked. After crashing in a remote Tibetan area near a lamasery called Shangri-La, the travelers discover that they have landed in an actual paradise, where there is no war or crime and where people live for hundreds of years. While most of the passengers have no desire to leave, Robert’s brother, George, is desperate to return to England with Maria, one of Shangri-La’s residents. George eventually persuades Robert to depart, and the three head back to civilization. Tragedy results, however, as Maria returns to her actual age and dies, which causes George to jump off a cliff. Robert ultimately returns to Shangri-La.
Until Lost Horizon, Columbia Pictures was regarded as a “Poverty Row” studio, best known for its B-films. With the success of the film, however, Columbia gained parity with the other studios in terms of industry respect. Lost Horizon’s stunning sets and cinematography produced some of the most haunting images in film history. The movie was severely cut after its first preview. The painstaking restoration of the original version began in 1973 and was completed for the 1998 DVD, though some sequences had to be re-created with still photos. The version of the film released during World War II was called The Lost Horizon of Shangri-La and was amended to include anti-Japanese propaganda.
