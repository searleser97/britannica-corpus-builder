The Defiant Ones,  American dramatic film, released in 1958, that was considered provocative at the time because of its focus on racism and its call for racial harmony.
In the racially segregated South, convicts John (“Joker”) Jackson (played by Tony Curtis) and Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier) are chained together. After their prison truck crashes, the two men escape. As they desperately try to elude the police, they are forced to overcome their racial prejudices.
The concept of two chained-together escaped convicts who hate each other was not unique, but the added twist in The Defiant Ones was that the convicts were of different races in a setting where segregation was still prevalent. The film’s message was obvious: all people in American society must learn to cooperate if they want to survive. The Defiant Ones was the first of producer and director Stanley Kramer’s “message pictures,” which touched on, without exploiting or exploring deeply, unconventional or controversial topics and which included such acclaimed films as Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967). Interestingly, no music is heard in The Defiant Ones except in the natural context of songs heard on a radio in various scenes. The script was cowritten by blacklisted writer Nedrick Young under the pseudonym Nathan E. Douglas.
