Planet of the Apes,  American science-fiction film, released in 1968, that blended action and social commentary to become a classic of that genre, inspiring four sequels and two television series.
Based on the novel of the same name by Pierre Boulle, the film centres on a group of astronauts—led by George Taylor (played by Charlton Heston)—who crash-land on a strange, seemingly distant planet ruled by civilized apes. Captured and caged, Taylor eventually persuades the chimpanzee scientists Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) to help him escape. The shocking ending—in which the remains of the Statue of Liberty are found, revealing that the supposedly unknown planet is really Earth—ranks among the most famous in film history.
The movie is consistently thrilling and thought-provoking, dealing with issues such as evolution and humans’ place in the universe. John Chambers’s pioneering special effects and prosthetics makeup techniques earned him a special Academy Award. The movie benefited from a notable cast that included Shakespearean actor Maurice Evans, who was particularly impressive as the ape leader, Dr. Zaius. (Edward G. Robinson was originally cast for this role, but the grueling daily makeup ritual was too tiring for him.) Also earning praise was the innovative score by Jerry Goldsmith. Planet of the Apes, which was written by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson, features numerous memorable lines, including “Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!” The immense popularity of the film resulted in four sequels: Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972), and Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973). Director Tim Burton remade the first film in 2001.
