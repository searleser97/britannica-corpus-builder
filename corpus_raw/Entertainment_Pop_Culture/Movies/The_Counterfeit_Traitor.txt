The Counterfeit Traitor,  American spy film, released in 1962, that was based on the real-life exploits of a double agent during World War II.
Eric Erickson (played by William Holden) is an American-born oil executive who is a naturalized citizen of Sweden, a neutral country during World War II. When his dealings with Germany earn him a place on the Allied Powers’ blacklist, he reluctantly agrees to serve as a double agent in exchange for his name being cleared after the war. The plan involves him convincing top German officials that he intends to build an oil plant in Sweden that will provide fuel for the Third Reich. As such, he is given access to refineries in Germany, and he passes the information he gleans to British Intelligence. He is aided by fellow spy Marianne Möllendorf (Lilli Palmer), with whom he develops an intense romantic relationship. After the Gestapo uncovers the truth about Möllendorf, the couple is arrested. Erickson witnesses her execution but is able to convince his captors of his innocence. His reprieve is brief, however, as a member of the Hitler Youth—and the son of a man who has been helping Erickson—soon reveals that he is a double agent. Aided by the German resistance, Erickson flees to Sweden, and after the war, his heroics are revealed.
A tense and intelligently scripted thriller, The Counterfeit Traitor was adapted from Alexander Klein’s 1958 book, which recounts Erickson’s experiences. Holden excelled in the lead role, and the film boasts fine direction by George Seaton.
