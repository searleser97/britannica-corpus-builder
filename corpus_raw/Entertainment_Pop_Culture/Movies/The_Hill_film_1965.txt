The Hill,  American film drama, released in 1965, that was an acclaimed work of Neorealism from director Sidney Lumet.
Set in a British military prison in the Libyan desert during World War II, The Hill centres on a group of soldiers jailed for such offenses as insubordination, drunkenness, and profiteering. They are guarded by a cruel sergeant (played by Ian Hendry) who delights in torturing them both physically and psychologically, as when he forces the prisoners to make repeated climbs up an artificial hill. After a soldier dies, attempts to expose the inhumane conditions are thwarted when revenge-seeking prisoners kill the guard.
The Hill was important to Sean Connery as he tried to gain credibility as an actor in roles more demanding than those offered by his James Bond films, and, to most critics, he succeeded brilliantly as a tough nonconformist prisoner. Harry Andrews is also riveting, as the commandant who fails to realize his power is being undermined by his sadistic sergeant. The black-and-white photography is well suited to conveying the struggle of the prisoners as they trudge “the hill” in the blistering heat.
