City Lights,  American silent romantic-comedy film, released in 1931, that was considered by many to be Charlie Chaplin’s crowning achievement in the cinema.
In this simple story the Tramp (played by Chaplin) befriends a poor blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) and convinces her that he is a wealthy man. Through his generosity, she finally receives the operation that restores her sight, but by then the tragedy-prone Tramp is doing a stretch in prison. In the famous final sequence, the Tramp pays a visit to her flower shop. Her gradual realization that this pathetic man is her true benefactor has been called one of the most touching moments in film history.
By the time City Lights premiered in 1931, Hollywood had converted exclusively to talking pictures. Since Chaplin was both an independent producer and an owner of United Artists, he was able to use his considerable clout to make a silent film. His instincts were proved right when the film both was acclaimed as a masterpiece and became a box-office success. City Lights’s legacy has stood the test of time, and critics rank it among the seminal works of the American cinema.
