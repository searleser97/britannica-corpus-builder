Here Comes Mr. Jordan,  American romantic comedy film, released in 1941, that involves a boxer who is taken to heaven before his time but is given a second chance at life.
Robert Montgomery played prize-fighter and amateur pilot Joe Pendleton, who, on the verge of winning the championship, is involved in a plane accident and mistakenly taken to heaven by an officious angel. To rectify the error and to give him a chance to win the boxing title although his body has been cremated, he is returned to life in another man’s body, that of a crooked wealthy banker named Farnsworth, whose scheming wife has killed him. The audience continues to see Montgomery as Pendleton, though everyone else in the film sees and hears him as Farnsworth. However, after Farnsworth is murdered for a second time, Pendleton assumes the body of Ralph Murdoch, a boxer who had been shot for refusing to throw a match. Pendleton ultimately wins the championship and names Farnsworth’s killers. Shortly thereafter, memories of his previous life are erased, and Pendleton fully becomes Murdoch.
Acclaimed performances were turned in by Montgomery, James Gleason as Pendleton’s trainer, and Claude Rains as the angel’s supervisor who delightfully orchestrates the convoluted goings-on. The film spurred many remakes, including Heaven Can Wait (1978), which starred Warren Beatty, and it inspired the television series Quantum Leap (1989–93).
