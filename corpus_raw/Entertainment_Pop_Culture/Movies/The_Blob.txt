The Blob,  American horror film, released in 1958, that is one of the genre’s most popular low-budget movies of the 1950s, especially well liked by teenagers and drive-in audiences.
A meteorite containing a tiny gelatinous creature crashes near a small town. As the slow-moving blob eats every human it encounters, it grows into a gigantic, seemingly unstoppable creature. Only a stalwart group of teenagers can stop it and save the populace.
The Blob was an independent production, shot on location in rural Pennsylvania by a crew that had made hundreds of educational and religious short films. The film afforded the young Steve McQueen (billed here as Steven McQueen) his first starring role. When McQueen then secured the lead role in the TV western Wanted: Dead or Alive, the popularity of The Blob skyrocketed. Although often outlandish and contrived, the film has long been considered well-made fun and has proved to have a more enduring legacy than many of the large-budget films of its type. Burt Bacharach and Mark David wrote the campy title song for the film, “Beware the Blob,” which became a nationwide hit.
