Rear Window,  American thriller film, released in 1954, that is considered one of Alfred Hitchcock’s most suspenseful movies. It starred Hitchcock favourites James Stewart and Grace Kelly.
Stewart played L.B. Jeffries, a photographer who is confined to a wheelchair while recuperating from a broken leg. He spends his days obsessively spying out his back window into the apartments of the buildings behind him, getting to know his neighbours without ever meeting them. Gradually he becomes convinced that one neighbour (played by Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. Jeffries is aided in his sleuthing by his girlfriend (Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter).
As with Hitchcock’s 1944 film Lifeboat, which takes place entirely at sea, Rear Window presented the director with an opportunity to craft a suspense picture within a very confined space. The apartment complex where the action takes place was the largest set ever built indoors on the Paramount lot. Hitchcock made one of his classic cameo appearances in Rear Window, where he is seen winding a clock in the apartment of a composer.
