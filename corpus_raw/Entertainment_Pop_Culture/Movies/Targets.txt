Targets,  American thriller film, released in 1968, that marked the directorial debut of Peter Bogdanovich. It is loosely based on a real-life incident in 1966 in which Charles Whitman, an ex-Marine and a student at the University of Texas, killed his wife and mother and then began randomly shooting people from atop a tower on the campus—though it also acquired an unexpected resonance from the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy, which occurred mere months before the film’s release.
Bogdanovich, who also cowrote the script and produced, interweaves two stories. In one, a young, handsome insurance salesman and Vietnam War veteran, Bobby Thompson (played by Tim O’Kelly), embarks on a killing spree around Los Angeles. In the other, an aging and once-revered star of horror movies, Byron Orlok (Boris Karloff, in a semiautobiographical role), wearily contemplates his future. The narratives converge at a drive-in movie theatre where Orlok is making a personal appearance and Bobby has hidden behind the screen with plans to fire into the crowd. The tension-filled climax, in which the actor confronts the sniper, strikingly juxtaposes the old face of terror with a new, modern one.
Horror-movie director Roger Corman allowed Bogdanovich the opportunity to make the film on the condition that he cast Karloff and incorporate footage from one of Corman’s films. Bogdanovich, who had great reverence for older Hollywood stars, provided Karloff with the last significant role of his career at a time when the industry had largely ignored him. The clips presented at the beginning and end of the film as Orlok’s latest picture are from Corman’s The Terror (1963), which starred Karloff. Bogdanovich also has a supporting role as a put-upon movie director.
