Kiss of Death,  American film noir, released in 1947, that is especially noted for the chilling performance by Richard Widmark in his screen debut.
Nick Bianco (played by Victor Mature) decides to testify against his former mob cronies in order to win release from prison and be reunited with his family. The caveat is that he must reintegrate himself into the mob and risk his life to bring the top criminals to justice. He provides evidence against sadistic killer Tommy Udo (Widmark), but Udo is ultimately acquitted, which sets up a showdown between the two men.
Widmark earned high praise for his portrayal of a vicious thug incapable of distinguishing rival gangsters from helpless victims. His Academy Award-nominated performance is defined by the famous scene in which he laughs hysterically after throwing an elderly wheelchair-bound woman down a staircase to her death. A scene originally filmed depicted Biancoâ€™s wife committing suicide after being raped by a gangster assigned to guard her, but the studio later removed it owing to its controversial nature. A 1995 remake of Kiss of Death featured David Caruso and Nicolas Cage.
