Moulin Rouge,  British dramatic film, released in 1952, that chronicles the life of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. José Ferrer’s performance as the legendary French artist was widely acclaimed.
The John Huston-directed biopic traces the life and work of Toulouse-Lautrec as he worked in the bohemian subculture of Paris in the late 19th century, especially around the burlesque hall known as the Moulin Rouge. There he sketched the dancers as they performed, painted promotional posters for the establishment, and became a pawn of cruel women whose love he craved.
To play the part of the artist, whose growth had been stunted by childhood accidents and for whom even walking was a painful challenge, Ferrer worked with Huston to design clever camera angles, costumes, and set devices. The actor even underwent a painful procedure that bound his legs behind him so he could walk on his knees. The role earned Ferrer an Academy Award nomination, and the set designs were highly praised for their replication of late 19th-century Paris.
