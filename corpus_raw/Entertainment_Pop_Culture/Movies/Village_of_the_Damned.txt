Village of the Damned,  British science-fiction film, released in 1960, that is noted for its unsettling story line about demonic children.
Every resident of a small British village inexplicably—and simultaneously—falls asleep for hours. Months later it is discovered that all women of childbearing age are pregnant. They give birth to children with identical blonde hair and penetrating eyes. The children possess incredible intelligence, and they can read minds and bend others to their will. They are also completely emotionless. As the children grow, it becomes clear that they are not of this world and that their intentions are anything but benign.
The film—which was based on John Wyndham’s The Midwich Cuckoos (1957)—was controversial for its dealing with the subject of demonic virgin births. It was reportedly for this reason that actor Ronald Colman’s studio refused to allow him to play the lead role, which ultimately went to George Sanders. The young Martin Stephens, who portrayed the eeriest of the children, was highly praised for his performance, as were Sanders and Barbara Shelley. A sequel, Children of the Damned, was released in 1963. A 1995 remake of the original starred Christopher Reeve.
