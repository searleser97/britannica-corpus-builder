In Harm’s Way,  American war film, released in 1965, that centres on the Pearl Harbor attack and its aftermath. The cast of this World War II epic included John Wayne and Kirk Douglas.
The film opens with the Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in 1941 and then traces its effect on the lives of numerous U.S. military personnel. Captain Rockwell Torrey (played by Wayne) is the tough-as-nails navy veteran who romances nurse Maggie Haynes (Patricia Neal) while plotting a top-secret attack on the Japanese fleet. He must also deal with his estranged son Jere (Brandon deWilde), who is serving as an ensign on a patrol torpedo (PT) boat. Torrey’s friend Commander Paul Eddington (Kirk Douglas) is a capable but troubled man whose hot temper and sexual desires lead to tragic consequences. As the war encroaches on the lives of these characters, they are each forced to examine their own values and personal definitions of courage.
In Harm’s Way, which was based on a novel by James Bassett, was one of the last major studio productions shot in black and white. Under Otto Preminger’s direction, the film interweaves action sequences with compelling story lines. The cast included such Hollywood veterans as Burgess Meredith, Dana Andrews, Henry Fonda, Stanley Holloway, and Bruce Cabot. The film also benefited from the strong chemistry between Wayne and Douglas. Loyal Griggs earned an Academy Award nomination for his cinematography. Although the model work in the battle scenes has long been criticized as clumsy, In Harm’s Way is widely considered one of the best war movies of its era.
