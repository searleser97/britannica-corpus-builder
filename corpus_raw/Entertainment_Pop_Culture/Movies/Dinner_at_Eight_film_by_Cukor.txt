Dinner at Eight,  American  comedy film, released in 1933, that was directed by George Cukor and featured an all-star cast. The witty and fast-paced film was based on the play by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber.
A dizzy socialite (played by Billie Burke) is so determined to keep her social status in high gear by inviting influential people to a dinner party that she all but ignores the deteriorating health and disastrous business concerns of her husband (Lionel Barrymore). The film also follows the party’s invitees, allowing each to present his or her own story or dilemma. Plotlines include the betrayal of a brash crooked businessman (Wallace Beery) by his social-climbing wife (Jean Harlow) and the melancholy tale of an aging actor (John Barrymore) who is unable to admit that his days of greatness are gone.
Despite the film’s largely comedic tone, it addresses issues such as adultery, suicide, and the tenuous nature of social standing. Though brothers John and Lionel Barrymore both appear in the film, they have no scenes together. Screen couple Harlow and Beery grew to despise each other during production, which reportedly contributed to the realism of their onscreen squabbling.
