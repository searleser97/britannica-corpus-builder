Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,  film score by Chinese composer Tan Dun for the 2000 Ang Lee film of the same name. The music for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon blends Chinese harmonies and instruments with Western orchestra music, creating moods ranging from wistful romance to heroic triumph.
The film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is set in the 18th century, during China’s Qing dynasty. Combining a love story and an adventure, the tale revolves around a struggle to possess a powerful sword named the Green Destiny. Tan Dun’s score features many prominent solo lines for cello, for which the composer recruited the esteemed French-born American cellist Yo-Yo Ma.
After Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was released, Tan Dun reworked themes from the score into a concerto for Ma. The Crouching Tiger Concerto premiered in London with Ma as soloist on September 28, 2000. The performance was accompanied by a video presentation derived from footage produced during the filming. A second version of the concerto, composed for the cellolike Chinese instrument called the erhu, was produced a year later.
