Father of the Bride,  American comedy film, released in 1950, that is considered a classic of the genre, especially noted for Spencer Tracy’s performance.
Tracy portrayed Stanley T. Banks, the exasperated father of a bride-to-be (played by Elizabeth Taylor). Told in flashback, the film chronicles Banks’s slow but steady descent into virtual madness by the day-to-day problems and expenses associated with the wedding.
Tracy earned an Academy Award nomination for his subtle portrayal, and the supporting cast—including Joan Bennett, who played Banks’s wife, and Billie Burke as the mother of the groom—was also praised. The film, which was adeptly directed by Vincente Minnelli, inspired a sequel, Father’s Little Dividend (1951), and a 1960s television series. A well-received 1991 remake starred Steve Martin and Diane Keaton.
