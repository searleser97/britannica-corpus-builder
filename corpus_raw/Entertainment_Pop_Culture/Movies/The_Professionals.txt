The Professionals,  American western film, released in 1966, that was an action-packed, testosterone-driven adventure featuring an all-star cast.
Four fortune hunters are hired by rich land baron Joe Grant (played by Ralph Bellamy) to ride into Mexico and rescue his young wife, Maria (Claudia Cardinale), who has been kidnapped by the notorious bandit Jesus Raza (Jack Palance). The mercenaries are Bill Dolworth (Burt Lancaster), Henry (“Rico”) Fardan (Lee Marvin), Jake Sharp (Woody Strode), and Hans Ehrengard (Robert Ryan). Each man has a particular talent that they hope can be utilized to enter Raza’s heavily guarded compound, rescue Maria, and make it back across the blazing desert, all the while being pursued by an overwhelming number of adversaries. In the midst of the seemingly suicidal mission, the men learn that they have been deceived by Grant. Maria was not kidnapped but ran away willingly with Raza. Nevertheless, they deliver her and a wounded Raza to Grant, who orders his rival killed. The four men intervene, however, allowing Maria and Raza to escape.
The Professionals was widely viewed as a highly entertaining picture that placed no demands on moviegoers and made no pretense of being anything other than an action film. While some criticized the gratuitous violence, the film was nonetheless well crafted and gripping. Richard Brooks—who served as director, producer, and writer—earned particular praise, and Maurice Jarre’s thrilling score enhanced the on-screen action.
