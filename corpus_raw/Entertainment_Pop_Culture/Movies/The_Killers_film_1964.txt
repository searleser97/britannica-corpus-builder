The Killers,  American crime film, released in 1964, that was adapted from an Ernest Hemingway short story that was originally brought to the screen in 1946.
The film opens with Johnny North (played by John Cassavetes), a race-car driver turned teacher, being fatally shot by hit men. The killers, Charlie (played by Lee Marvin) and Lee (Clu Gulager), later connect North to a robbery in which the proceeds were never recovered. Intent on finding the money, the men retrace North’s life and discover that he was double-crossed by a gangster (Ronald Reagan) and his mistress (Angie Dickinson).
The Killers is seen through the eyes of the hit men, played with icy perfection by Marvin and Gulager. The characters later served as role models for Quentin Tarantino’s assassins in Pulp Fiction (1994). Dickinson earned praise as the two-faced femme fatale who manipulates all the men around her. The Killers was originally shot as a television movie, but its violent content precluded it from being broadcast, and it was released theatrically. Director Don Siegel turned this loose remake into a suspenseful film that has withstood the test of time. Although Reagan said he always regretted playing the heavy in his final screen role, some critics believe it is one of the most effective performances of his career.
