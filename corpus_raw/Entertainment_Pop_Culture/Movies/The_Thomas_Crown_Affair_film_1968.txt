The Thomas Crown Affair,  American caper film, released in 1968, featuring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in a cat-and-mouse game with erotic overtones.
Playing against type, McQueen portrays a rich businessman who relieves his boredom by hiring a gang to stage an audacious string of ingenious heists. Dunaway plays the insurance investigator sent to solve the crimes. The two become lovers even as they try to thwart one another.
The Thomas Crown Affair was especially noted for the chemistry between McQueen and Dunaway. There are several memorable sexually charged moments, including a chess game with phallic overtones. The film was also known for its stylish production. Director Norman Jewison made creative use of split-screen images, which was an innovation at that time. The Oscar-winning song “The Windmills of Your Mind” was subsequently recorded by numerous musicians, but the original version heard over the main titles is sung by Noel Harrison. A popular remake of the film starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo was released in 1999.
