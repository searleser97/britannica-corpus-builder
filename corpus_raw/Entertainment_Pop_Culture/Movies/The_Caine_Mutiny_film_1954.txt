The Caine Mutiny,  American film drama, released in 1954, that was based on the best-selling novel by Herman Wouk. Humphrey Bogart’s portrayal of Captain Queeg, considered by many to be his last great performance, earned him a final Academy Award nomination.
Soon after he takes command of the destroyer-minesweeper U.S.S. Caine, Queeg’s erratic behaviour becomes a cause of concern for the crewmen. When the Caine encounters a typhoon, he appears to have a mental breakdown, and a mutiny takes place. The mutineers subsequently face a court-martial, but when Queeg undergoes cross-examination, his instability becomes apparent, and the sailors are acquitted.
Producer Stanley Kramer could get U.S. Navy cooperation with the filming only after he agreed to add a disclaimer assuring moviegoers that no such mutiny had ever occurred. Critics have praised both Fred MacMurray’s performance as the officer who incites the mutiny and the finale of the film, in which the defense attorney (played by José Ferrer) gives a passionate soliloquy.
