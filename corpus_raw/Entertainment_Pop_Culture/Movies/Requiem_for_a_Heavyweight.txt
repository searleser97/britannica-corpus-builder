Requiem for a Heavyweight,  American film drama, released in 1962, that takes a grim look at the underbelly of the boxing world.
Requiem for a Heavyweight was adapted for the screen by Rod Serling, who originally wrote the script as a teleplay for the television show Playhouse 90. Anthony Quinn portrayed “Mountain” Rivera, a slow-witted but kindhearted boxer who is well beyond his prime but is still used and manipulated by his manager (played by Jackie Gleason). Julie Harris played a social worker who becomes smitten by Quinn’s character and urges him to find a different career.
Serling was an experienced boxer, which helped bring realism to the drama. The cast earned critical praise for their performances, including Mickey Rooney as Quinn’s one true friend. Muhammad Ali (then known as Cassius Clay) appeared in the opening boxing bout. The 1956 broadcast of Requiem for a Heavyweight—which starred Jack Palance, who was also a former boxer—has been cited as one of the best examples of live drama ever performed on television. In 1957 Sean Connery played the lead role in the BBC production of the story.
