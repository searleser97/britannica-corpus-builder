The Departed,  American crime film, released in 2006, that was directed by Martin Scorsese and won four Academy Awards, including best picture. A tense action thriller with an all-star cast, it was one of Scorsese’s biggest hits at the box office.
The Departed is set in Boston. Colin Sullivan (played by Matt Damon) is a protégé of Irish American crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson), and he joins the state police force as a mole for Costello. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a police recruit who is chosen by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sgt. Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) as an undercover officer, known only to them, assigned to infiltrate Costello’s organization. Both Sullivan and Costigan have a relationship with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). As each organization becomes aware that it has been infiltrated, Sullivan and Costigan work to determine the identity of the mole while trying to keep their own duplicity from being found out. They engage in a game of cat-and-mouse in which each is often within a hair’s breadth of discovering the other. In an extra twist, it emerges that Costello is also an FBI informant. Upon learning of this, Sullivan kills Costello. Costigan then attempts to give up his undercover role, thus revealing himself to Sullivan, but he discovers that Sullivan was Costello’s mole. In a violent climax, Costigan is killed by a second dirty cop, and Sullivan kills that cop and walks away free. He returns to his home, only to be ambushed and killed by Dignam.
The Departed was a remake of the popular Hong Kong film Mou gaan dou (2002; Infernal Affairs). It was the first movie for which Scorsese, one of the industry’s most respected directors, won a best director Oscar. Nicholson’s portrayal of Costello was loosely based on real-life crime boss Whitey Bulger and was often improvised.
