The Knack…and How to Get It,  British romantic comedy film, released in 1965, that was directed by Richard Lester, who was best known for the Beatles’ hit feature films A Hard Day’s Night (1964) and Help! (1965). The movie is a fine example of New Wave influence in British cinema.
In the film, Colin (played by Michael Crawford), a shy teacher, begs his housemate Tolen (Ray Brooks), who has the knack of bedding any woman he wants, to give him advice on how to do the same. Conflict arises when Colin finally meets his dream girl, Nancy (Rita Tushingham), whom his pal attempts to seduce. Although initially perceived as innocent, Nancy proves to be surprisingly savvy in repelling the young Lothario’s charms.
Dreamlike sequences—such as that in which scores of beautiful women line the halls of the men’s house, waiting for their turn with Tolen—are reminiscent of the madcap surreality at play in Lester’s Beatles’ films. Although tame by modern standards, the story—which climaxes with a glib accusation of rape—was considered edgy in 1965. The film offers a snapshot of London at the peak of the “mod” movement of the 1960s, and John Barry’s musical score well reflects the era.
