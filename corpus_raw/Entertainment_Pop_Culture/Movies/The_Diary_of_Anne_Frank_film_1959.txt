The Diary of Anne Frank,  American dramatic film, released in 1959, that depicts the story of Anne Frank, a German Jewish teenager who died in a World War II concentration camp and whose diary is arguably the most famous work about the Holocaust. The screenplay was written by Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett, who adapted their Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name.
The narrative focuses on Anne Frank (played by Millie Perkins) and her family, residents of Amsterdam who go into hiding in 1942, during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. Their hiding space, a secret annex within an office building, is shared by another Jewish family, the Van Daans, and Anne soon becomes close to their son, Peter (Richard Beymer). The confined space of the secret annex causes strain for both families, though, and their morale becomes lower  when they receive news of the Nazi concentration camps. Although the families manage to avoid notice during a Gestapo search of the building, tensions remain high over the subsequent months. Meanwhile, Anne finds solace in writing in a diary and is a source of optimism amid the adultsâ€™ growing despair. In July 1944, however, the Gestapo finally discover the annex, and Anne and Peter passionately embrace before they meet their fate.
Director George Stevens knew well the horrors of the Holocaust, having been among the first to film the atrocities in the death camps at the time of their liberation. Though The Diary of Anne Frank was not a commercial success and the performances were met with mixed reviews, the film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three. Among these was a best supporting actress statuette for Shelley Winters as the strident Mrs. Van Daan.
