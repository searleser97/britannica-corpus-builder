Torn Curtain,  American spy film, released in 1966, that was notable for being one of Alfred Hitchcock’s least-successful productions.
Michael Armstrong (played by Paul Newman) is a famous American physicist who travels to Copenhagen with his fiancée, Sarah Sherman (Julie Andrews), to attend a scientific conference. Once there, however, he informs Sherman that he is flying to East Berlin. Thinking he has defected, Sherman follows him but soon learns that he is really on a secret mission to infiltrate the East German scientific community and learn the extent of their knowledge of U.S. nuclear defense systems. The ploy works, and Armstrong induces a top East German scientist to reveal crucial secret information. However, the secret police learn of his mission, and a tense series of near arrests occur, one of which ends with Armstrong and a farmer’s wife killing an enemy operative. Armstrong and Sherman later take refuge in a crowded theatre, and when the police arrive, Armstrong shouts, “Fire,” so that he and Sherman can escape in the ensuing panic. The couple ultimately hides in travel trunks that are loaded onto a steamer bound for Sweden. After another near capture, Armstrong and Sherman reach safety.
When Torn Curtain was released, it was uniformly derided by critics as an ill-fated attempt by Hitchcock to exploit the spy-movie trend. The director himself later criticized the casting of the movie, saying there was no chemistry between Newman and Andrews, who were signed at Universal’s request. However, the thriller does feature a number of effective action scenes, notably a graphic murder sequence set in a kitchen. One of Hitchcock’s more memorable scenes, it was his attempt to show the difficulty in killing someone. Hitchcock’s longtime collaborator Bernard Hermann wrote the film’s original score, but when the director yielded to studio pressure to replace him with John Addison, the two men never worked together again.
