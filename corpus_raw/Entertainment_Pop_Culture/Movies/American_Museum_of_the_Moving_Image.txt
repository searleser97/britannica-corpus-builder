American Museum of the Moving Image,  museum dedicated to educating the public about the history of film and television arts and about the impact those media have on popular culture. Established in 1988 in Astoria, New York, the museum is a rebuilt portion of what was once Paramount Pictures’ Astoria film studio.
The museum’s collection contains more than 80,000 artifacts related to the history and art of motion pictures, including the chariot driven by Charlton Heston in Ben-Hur (1959), the dental device used to create the jowled cheeks of Marlon Brando in The Godfather (1972), and the doll with the rotating head that was used as a double for the possessed Linda Blair in The Exorcist (1973). Among the other notable items in the musuem are costumes from various movies and television shows, hundreds of vintage film magazines, and a large collection of film and TV-related merchandise, ranging from antique cigarette cards to toys based on Star Trek and The Simpsons. The William Fox Gallery presents exhibitions that document the history of digital media such as video and computer games. In addition, live enactments re-create every step of the filmmaking process, from production to exhibition.
One of the museum’s three floors houses dozens of historic movie cameras, projectors, television sets, and video players. The other two floors offer interactive exhibits that allow visitors to dub their own voices to famous film clips, see themselves dressed in famous movie costumes, and produce their own animated flipbooks. Several films and TV shows are regularly presented in either the 200-seat Riklis Theater or the ornately decorated Tut’s Fever Movie Palace; there are also smaller screening rooms for educational films and documentaries. The museum offers educational workshops designed to teach history and the English language through the use of movies and television programs.
