The Devil and Daniel Webster,  American fantasy film, released in 1941, that was based on Stephen Vincent Benét’s 1937 short story of the same name. The movie is noted for its innovative camera work and Academy Award-winning score.
Jabez Stone (played by James Craig), a down-on-his-luck 19th-century farmer in New Hampshire, sells his soul to the Devil, Mr. Scratch (Walter Huston), in exchange for seven years of wealth and good luck. As his fortunes improve, Stone becomes heartless and cruel, alienating all around him and falling under the spell of a beautiful siren (Simone Simon) sent by Mr. Scratch to lead him astray. When the seven years are nearly up, Stone asks noted orator and hero of the common man Daniel Webster (Edward Arnold) to come to his defense. A trial for Stone’s soul ensues before a “jury of the damned,” which includes such notorious men as Benedict Arnold. In the end, however, Webster is victorious.
Craig excelled as the frantic, self-pitying Stone, and Arnold—who took the role on a day’s notice when Thomas Mitchell was injured and could not perform—gave a noteworthy performance as the blustery and larger-than-life Webster. Perhaps most memorable, however, was Huston, who portrayed the Devil not as a man of sinister menace but as a charismatic and avuncular old salt who hides his evil intentions while seducing his victims. A critical success but a box-office failure, the film was released under various names, including All That Money Can Buy. Significant footage was cut for subsequent theatrical releases but was later restored for home video.
