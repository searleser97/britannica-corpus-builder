In Which We Serve,  British war film, released in 1942, that marked the directorial debuts of Noël Coward and David Lean; Coward also produced, wrote, scored, and starred in the film.
“This is a story of ship” begins the narration that opens this World War II film. The ship is a British destroyer, the HMS Torrin, which sinks during the Battle of Crete (1941). Forced to abandon ship, the sailors and officers cling to a life raft, whereupon the film proceeds in flashback. The history of the Torrin (such as its role during the Dunkirk evacuation) is told, as are the stories of the various men, including Captain Kinross (played by Coward), “Shorty” Blake (John Mills), and Chief Petty Officer Hardy (Bernard Miles). Cutting back to the film’s present, German planes periodically strafe the raft, killing more of the men and wounding others. Eventually 90 sailors are rescued and transported to safety in Egypt, whereupon Captain Kinross encourages the surviving sailors and the families of the dead (and by extension the Allied wartime audience) to find inspiration in the sacrifice of his valiant men and to persevere in the many battles to come. A patriotic epilogue then describes the many ships being built and launched to avenge the Torrin and other sunk vessels and to ensure victory for England and the Allies.
The film was widely popular with British audiences, who saw it as a reflection of their national fortitude. It was nominated for two Academy Awards (best picture and best original screenplay), and Coward received a special Oscar for his production achievement. Celia Johnson, who later starred in Coward’s classic Brief Encounter (1945), played Captain Kinross’s wife. In Which We Serve also marks the film debut of Richard Attenborough, who appeared in an uncredited role. A sanitized American version of the film, absent the script’s occasional “hell” and “damn,” was later released and shown frequently on television.
