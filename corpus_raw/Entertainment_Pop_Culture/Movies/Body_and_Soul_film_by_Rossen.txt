Body and Soul,  American dramatic film, released in 1947, that highlighted the seedy underbelly of the boxing industry. Many consider it one of the best films about the sport, especially noted for its realistic fight scenes.
Although Body and Soul is not ostensibly a crime film, gangsters figure prominently in the rise and fall of the hero, Charlie Davis (played by John Garfield). Davis enters the boxing arena in an attempt to move up from poverty. He succeeds only to fall victim to the temptations of fame and fortune.
The acclaimed boxing sequences were filmed by cinematographer James Wong Howe, who roller-skated around the ring with a handheld camera. Tragedy seemed to encompass many of the primary participants of Body and Soul. Garfield, along with screenwriter Abraham Polonsky and costar Canada Lee, were all targeted by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. In 1952 Garfield died prematurely at age 39. His close friends attributed his death from coronary thrombosis to the stress caused by the committeeâ€™s investigation.
