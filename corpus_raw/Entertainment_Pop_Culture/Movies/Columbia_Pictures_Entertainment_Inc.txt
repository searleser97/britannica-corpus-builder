Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc.,,   American motion-picture studio that became a major Hollywood studio under its longtime president, Harry Cohn.
Columbia originated in 1920 when Cohn, Joe Brandt, and Harry’s brother Jack Cohn founded the C.B.C. Sales Film Corporation to produce shorts and low-budget westerns and comedies. In an attempt to refurbish the studio’s reputation, its name was changed to Columbia Pictures in 1924. Brandt was company president from 1924 to 1932, but Cohn was the driving force behind Columbia’s rise to a position of equality with the other major Hollywood studios. Cohn served as president from 1932 until his death in 1958.
Columbia’s breakthrough came after Harry Cohn hired Frank Capra in the late 1920s to direct the studio’s comedies. In 1934 Capra made the hit It Happened One Night, starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert; it won the Academy Award for best picture of 1934. Capra’s other comedies for Columbia include Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). During this same period, Howard Hawks and others made some of the finest screwball comedies of the 1930s for Columbia: The Awful Truth (1937), Holiday (1938), and His Girl Friday (1940), all starring Cary Grant.
After Capra’s departure in 1939, Columbia languished because leading directors were reluctant to work for the notoriously hard-driving and vulgar Cohn. But in the 1950s Columbia regained its stature through its backing of various independent producers and directors, among them Elia Kazan, Fred Zinnemann, David Lean, Robert Rossen, Otto Preminger, and Joseph Losey. The result was such films as All the King’s Men (1949), Born Yesterday (1950), From Here to Eternity (1953), On the Waterfront (1954), The Caine Mutiny (1954), The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), A Man for All Seasons (1966), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Tootsie (1982), Gandhi (1982), and The Last Emperor (1987). Columbia also financed some of the better youth-oriented films from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, such as Easy Rider (1969), Five Easy Pieces (1970), The Last Picture Show (1971), and The Big Chill (1983).
Columbia was purchased by The Coca-Cola Company in 1982. That same year, Columbia helped launch a new motion-picture studio, Tri-Star Pictures, which was merged with Columbia in 1987 to form Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc. In 1989 Columbia was acquired by the Sony Corporation of Japan.
