The Incredible Mr. Limpet,  American comedic fantasy film, released in 1964, that featured Don Knotts in his first box-office hit as a leading man. This family movie combined live action with animation.
Meek bookkeeper Henry Limpet (played by Knotts) has a passion for studying fish. When the United States is attacked at Pearl Harbor during World War II, Henry tries to enlist in the navy but is rejected. Suffering from depression, he falls off a pier into the sea and is presumed drowned. Instead, he is magically transformed into a fish, portrayed in animated underwater segments, and becomes the U.S. Navyâ€™s most unlikely hero.
Knotts was one of the most popular character actors on television owing to his Emmy-winning role as Deputy Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show, and his appeal translated to the big screen. Although critics virtually ignored the film, it proved to have an enduring legacy. The animation is among the best from the 1960s, outside of the films produced by Disney; in fact, John Rose, who worked as a production associate for Disney, served as producer on this film.
