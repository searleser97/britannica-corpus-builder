Blackboard Jungle,  American social-commentary film, released in 1955, that highlighted violence in urban schools and also helped spark the rock-and-roll revolution by featuring the hit song “Rock Around the Clock” (1954) by Bill Haley and His Comets. It was the first major film to feature rock music on its sound track.
Richard Dadier (played by Glenn Ford) is a well-meaning New York City teacher assigned to a high school where teenage delinquents led by Artie West (Vic Morrow) terrorize students and teachers alike. On Dadier’s first day, fellow teacher Lois Hammond (Margaret Hayes) is nearly raped by a student. Dadier beats her assailant, but he and math teacher Joshua Edwards (Richard Kiley) are attacked by Artie and his gang in retaliation. Despite being badly beaten, Dadier is determined to reach his students. He eventually breaks Artie’s hold over his classmates and persuades one of them, Gregory Miller (Sidney Poitier), to stay in school.
Blackboard Jungle was based on a popular 1954 novel by Evan Hunter. The film hit a nerve with its unusually brutal depiction of the social conditions of urban schools, and the music and the theme made the movie hugely popular with teenage audiences. Fights and riots broke out in many towns in England where the movie was shown. Morrow and Poitier received special praise for their roles as the chief delinquents. Poitier, ironically, later played a teacher in a similar British film, To Sir, with Love (1967).
