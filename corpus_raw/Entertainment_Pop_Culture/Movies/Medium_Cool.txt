Medium Cool,  American film drama, released in 1969, that captured the fractious spirit of its day and highlighted the many social and ethical issues of the late 1960s.
Medium Cool follows television news cameraman John Cassellis (played by Robert Forster) as he shoots hard-to-get footage of disasters, accidents, and other unseemly incidents that his network demands. Cassellis faces a moral dilemma when he learns his bosses are providing footage to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to track down dissidents. Initially detached from the material he films, he experiences an emotional awakening by the movie’s conclusion.
Made at the height of the Vietnam War protest movement, Medium Cool became controversial because of director and cinematographer Haskell Wexler’s mixing of fact and fiction and his inclusion of actual footage he shot at the disastrous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The film originally received an X rating, ostensibly because of its explicit language and nudity, but most critics felt the harsh rating stemmed from its counterculture subject matter. The film’s title comes from Canadian communications scholar Marshall McLuhan’s description of television as a “cool” medium.
