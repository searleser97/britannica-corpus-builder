The Fall of the Roman Empire,  American epic film, released in 1964, that was a box-office failure but remains one of the more intelligent spectacles of the genre.
As the film opens, Marcus Aurelius (played by Alec Guinness) is the wise and revered emperor of the Roman Empire. When he decides that his heir apparent should be his adopted son Livius (Stephen Boyd), his biological son Commodus (Christopher Plummer) and a conspirator poison him. Knowing that Livius is not nearly as politically ambitious as he is, Commodus convinces him to step aside. It is a move that Livius soon regrets: Commodus rules Rome with an iron hand, completely disregarding the well-being of the people and single-handedly reducing the grandeur of the Roman Empire. He sentences his own sister Lucilla (Sophia Loren) to death and sets up a final confrontation with Livius that determines the fate of Rome.
Producer Samuel Bronston’s penchant for making epic films reached its zenith with The Fall of the Roman Empire, which came close to rivaling the production costs of the ill-fated Cleopatra (1963). The later movie, however, does a credible job of condensing some of the main historical facts while simultaneously presenting an engrossing love story between Livius and Lucilla. However, slow pacing and a running time of more than three hours contributed to its inability to find an audience. A financial failure, the film effectively ended Bronston’s career, as he made only five subsequent movies—two of which were uncredited and none of which were made on the grand scale of his earlier productions.
