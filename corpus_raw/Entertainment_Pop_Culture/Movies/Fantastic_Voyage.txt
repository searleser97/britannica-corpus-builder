Fantastic Voyage,  American science-fiction film, released in 1966, that is especially noted for its special effects, which were used to simulate a journey through the human body.
A Czech scientist who possesses invaluable information involving the process for miniaturizing human beings and objects escapes to the United States, where he is shot in an assassination attempt. Desperate to save his life, a team of scientists are placed in a submarine, which is shrunk and inserted into his body. They have one hour to repair a blood clot before returning to their real size. The mission is further complicated by the presence of a saboteur.
The screenplay for Fantastic Voyage was novelized by Isaac Asimov and released before the film was completed, giving the impression that the movie was based on Asimovâ€™s book. Its (then) state-of-the-art special effects have continued to hold up well. As the scientist Cora, Raquel Welch appeared in one of her first leading roles.
