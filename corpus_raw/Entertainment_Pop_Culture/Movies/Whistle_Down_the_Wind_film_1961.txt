Whistle Down the Wind,  British film drama, released in 1961, that marked Bryan Forbes’s directorial debut and is a cult favourite in England.
The plot centres on a murder suspect and escaped convict (played by Alan Bates) who hides in a family’s barn and is discovered by a group of children who mistake him for Jesus Christ. They subsequently try to hide him from the authorities.
Whistle Down the Wind is heavily allegorical, contrasting the innocence of the children with the suspicious attitudes of the adults, but in the hands of Forbes the film avoids being heavy-handed or absurd. Fine performances were delivered by the child actors, including 14-year-old Hayley Mills—whose mother, Mary Hayley Bell, wrote the novel on which the film was based. Also earning critical praise were Bates, in one of his early film roles, and Bernard Lee, best known for his role as “M” in many James Bond films. The film inspired an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical of the same name.
