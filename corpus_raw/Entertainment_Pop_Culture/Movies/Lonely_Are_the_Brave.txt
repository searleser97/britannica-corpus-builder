Lonely Are the Brave,  American western film, released in 1962, that was a downbeat but moving tale of a cowboy out of place in the modern American West. Kirk Douglas earned acclaim in the lead role.
Jack Burns (played by Douglas) is a middle-aged cowboy who is comfortable on the plains of New Mexico but woefully unable to fit into urban society. He disdains modern comforts, travels by horseback, and commits minor acts of civil disobedience to tweak authorities. When his friend Paul Bondi (Michael Kane) is arrested for smuggling illegal immigrants across the border, Burns breaks the law and is himself arrested as part of his plan to help Bondi escape jail. When Bondi decides that he would rather serve his sentence, Burns breaks out by himself and becomes a fugitive. He ignores pleas from the sympathetic local sheriff (Walter Matthau) to surrender, and a manhunt ensues. Against all odds, Burns manages to outwit his pursuers, using his familiarity with the rugged landscape to his advantage. However, his quest for freedom ends tragically after he and his horse are fatally hit by a truck while crossing a highway.
The film was adapted from Edward Abbey’s novel The Brave Cowboy (1958). The script was written by Dalton Trumbo, who had earlier penned the screenplay for Spartacus (1960), which also starred Douglas. Lonely Are the Brave was especially notable for the performances by Douglas, Matthau, and Gena Rowlands, who played Bondi’s wife. Although a critical success, the film was a box-office disappointment, perhaps owing to its bleak storyline.
