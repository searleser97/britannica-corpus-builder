Northwest Passage, in full Northwest Passage: Book I—Rogers’ Rangers,  American adventure film, released in 1940, that deals with events of the French and Indian War, a theme rarely explored in film. It was based on the first part of Kenneth Roberts’s 1937 novel of the same name.
The story follows Langdon Towne (played by Robert Young), a young man recently expelled from college who aspires to become an artist. Towne and his friend Hunk Marriner (Walter Brennan) get drunk in a pub and are nearly arrested. They escape and encounter frontier soldier Robert Rogers (Spencer Tracy) and subsequently join Rogers’ Rangers, an elite group of frontiersmen who fought for the British during the Seven Years’ War. The group embarks on an often-disastrous mission against French troops and Indian tribes around Quebec, facing both fierce enemies and natural obstacles, including horrendous weather and starvation. Only at the end of the film do Rogers’ Rangers set out to find the famed Northwest Passage, the sea route of the North American continent connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, making the film’s title somewhat misleading. Towne, however, stays behind with his fiancée, Elizabeth (Ruth Hussey), to pursue his art.
King Vidor directed Northwest Passage, replacing W.S. Van Dyke, who had done initial work on the project. The film was noted for its stunning cinematography—for which it earned an Academy Award nomination—as well as riveting action sequences, including a human-formed chain across a raging river. The film was given the subtitle “Book I—Rogers’ Rangers” because it  follows only the first half of Roberts’s novel, which is split into two parts. A planned sequel never materialized because of the hardships encountered in making the film.
