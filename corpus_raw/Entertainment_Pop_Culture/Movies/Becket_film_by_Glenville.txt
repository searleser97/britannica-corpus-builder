Becket,  American-British dramatic film, released in 1964, that was an adaptation of French playwright Jean Anouilh’s play Becket ou l’honneur de Dieu (1959; Becket; or, The Honour of God) about the quarrel between Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, and King Henry II of England. The film features three of Britain’s most acclaimed actors of the 20th century: Richard Burton, Peter O’Toole, and John Gielgud.
In order to gain more control over the church, King Henry II (played by O’Toole) slyly appoints his close friend and confidant, Thomas Becket (Burton), archbishop of Canterbury. The move outrages the church, but instead of being Henry’s loyal puppet, Becket gains respect by taking his new profession as an archbishop seriously—a move that puts him in direct conflict with the king and leads to his murder in Canterbury Cathedral on Dec. 29, 1170.
The Academy Award-winning screenplay by Edward Anhalt centres on the friendship of the two men and how its dramatic destruction leads Henry to order Becket’s death. The film is verbose but has long held audiences because of the passionate performances of Burton and O’Toole, which rank among the finest of their careers. O’Toole would famously play the same king four years later in The Lion in Winter.
