Our Man Flint,  American spy film, released in 1966, that is considered one of the best James Bond parodies.
Former spy Derek Flint (played by James Coburn) is called back into action after ZOWIE (Zonal Organization World Intelligence Espionage) discovers that a secret group called GALAXY plans to rule the world by controlling the weather. In his quest to stop the evil organization, the unflappable Flint communicates with dolphins, gives dance lessons to Bolshoi ballerinas, and utilizes a number of gadgets—notably a cigarette lighter that has 83 functions. Eventually, he finds GALAXY’s island base and blows it up, killing the group’s leaders—though not before saving the women who were programmed to be “pleasure units.”
With its overt humour and nonstop action, Our Man Flint was one of the most popular Bond spoofs, and it became a critical and commercial success. The film elevated Coburn to leading-man status, and he received excellent support from Lee J. Cobb as the intelligence chief who is perpetually exasperated by Flint’s refusal to be a “team player.” Adding to the entertainment is Jerry Goldsmith’s lively score. A sequel, In Like Flint, appeared in 1967.
