Repulsion,  British psychological thriller film, released in 1965, directed by Roman Polanski and noted for the stellar lead performance of Catherine Deneuve.
Carol Ledoux (played by Deneuve) is a beautiful but fragile and mentally disturbed young woman from Belgium who lives with her sister Helen (Yvonne Furneaux) in London. When Helen and her married lover leave on holiday, she is left alone in the apartment, whereupon her mental condition deteriorates. Her attraction and repulsion toward sex and men drive her to madness and murder.
Repulsion was only Polanski’s second feature film. It was also his first film in English and the first in his so-called “apartment trilogy” (the others being Rosemary’s Baby [1968] and The Tenant [1976]), in which the antagonists are not external threats but internal demons in the minds of the protagonists. The movie pushed the envelope in terms of violence and the depiction of sexuality.
