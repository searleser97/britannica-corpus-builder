National Film Board of Canada (NFB),  Canadian department of film production. It was established in 1939 and directed by John Grierson (1898–1972), who developed the studio into a leading producer of documentaries, including the World War II propaganda series Canada Carries On and The World in Action, as well as Churchill’s Island (1941), which received the first Academy Award for a documentary and was the first Canadian film to win an Oscar. The studio also made high-quality animated movies by Norman McLaren (1914–87) and others, and it later expanded to produce feature films, including The Luck of Ginger Coffey (1964), The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974), The Company of Strangers (1990), and Atanarjuat (2001). Films produced by the NFB received numerous awards, and in 1989 the studio received an honorary Academy Award.
