Sons of the Desert,  American comedy film, released in 1933, that was widely considered to be one of the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy’s best movies. The film’s title inspired the long-standing international Laurel and Hardy fan society of the same name.
Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy play their typical disaster-magnet characters, in this case two men (also named Stanley and Oliver) who want to attend a convention at their fraternal lodge, the Sons of the Desert. When their wives object to the trip, Oliver feigns an illness that requires that he and Stanley go on a rejuvenating Hawaiian cruise, a ruse that allows the duo to attend their convention in Chicago. They soon discover that the boat they were supposed to be on has sunk, leading their families to believe that they are dead. After their wives discover the truth, more trouble ensues for Stan and Ollie.
Like other great comedy teams (such as the Three Stooges and Abbott and Costello), Laurel and Hardy’s contributions to cinema are not generally recognized through traditional feature films. Indeed, this legendary duo did much of their most memorable work in shorts, notably the Academy Award-winning The Music Box (1932). Nevertheless, Sons of the Desert remains one of their most enduring and acclaimed works.
