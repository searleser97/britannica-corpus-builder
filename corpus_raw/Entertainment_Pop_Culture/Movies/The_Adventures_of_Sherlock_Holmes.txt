The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,  American mystery-detective film, released in 1939, that was the second to feature the popular pairing of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as the classic Arthur Conan Doyle characters Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, respectively. It was ostensibly based on a play by William Gillette, though the two works had little in common.
The film opens as Professor Moriarty (played by George Zucco), Sherlock Holmes’s archrival, is acquitted of murder. Later Ann Brandon (Ida Lupino) visits the sleuth and his partner, Dr. Watson, at their famed residence on Baker Street and asks them to help solve a mystery: her brother has received the same bizarre note, showing a man with an albatross hanging from his neck, that her father had received before his brutal murder years earlier. After the brother is found murdered, Holmes correctly surmises that Ann’s life is in danger as well. He eventually determines that the murders and death threats are distractions orchestrated by Moriarty as a smoke screen for a larger crime, the “crime of the century”: the theft of the crown jewels from Britain’s Tower of London. Holmes rushes to the tower, and during his struggle with Moriarty the villain falls, presumably to his death.
The astounding success of the first pairing of Rathbone and Bruce as Holmes and Watson—The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939)—led Twentieth Century-Fox to expedite production of this film, in which the chemistry between the pair is clearly refined. However, it was the last movie in the series to be produced by Twentieth Century-Fox (Universal Studios did the others). It was also the last one set in Victorian England; all later Rathbone and Bruce Sherlock Holmes films were set in contemporary times.
