La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc, (French: “The Passion of Joan of Arc”)  French silent film, released in 1928, that was an acclaimed and historically accurate account of the trial and execution of Saint Joan of Arc in 1431.
The inventive film is a sober, intelligent drama detailing the last weeks in the life of Saint Joan of Arc (played by Maria Falconetti), who sought to save France from English conquest. After her capture by the Burgundians, she was sold to the English and tried for witchcraft and heresy. Her courageous stand led to her torture, and she was later burned at the stake.
Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer’s version of Joan’s life and tribulations, based on records of her actual trial, is regarded by many movie historians as one of the great works of the international cinema. His inventive use of close-ups, which constitute much of the film, was considered to be a major breakthrough in the way films were shot. Additionally, Falconetti’s performance in the lead role has been acclaimed by many film critics, including Pauline Kael, as the greatest in screen history. Ironically, she never acted on screen again.
