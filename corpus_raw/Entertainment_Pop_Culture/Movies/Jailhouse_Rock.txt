Jailhouse Rock,  American rock-and-roll film, released in 1957, that starred Elvis Presley in his third screen role. Widely considered his best film, it is primarily distinguished by a memorable title song and creative production numbers.
Vince Everett (played by Presley) is imprisoned for manslaughter following his participation in a bar brawl. While serving his sentence, and with the help of a fellow inmate, Everett discovers he has a knack for writing and performing music. Upon his release, he becomes a singing sensation but must navigate the pitfalls of both fame and new love. Peggy Van Alden (played by Judy Tyler) is the talent agent who helps him on his way up.
Jailhouse Rock is highly popular with Presley fans because it depicts “the King” at a time in his career when his talent was still raw and untamed. In most of his later cinematic endeavours, his business manager, Col. Tom Parker, forbade Presley to stray too far from a “safe” image, but the film’s engrossing plot allows its star to play a character with a degree of emotional depth. Presley, however, refused to watch the completed film after his costar Tyler was killed in a car accident just weeks after shooting for the movie had ended.
