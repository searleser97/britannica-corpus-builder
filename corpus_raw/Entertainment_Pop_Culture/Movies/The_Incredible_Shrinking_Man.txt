The Incredible Shrinking Man,  American science-fiction film, released in 1957, that features an inventive story, an intelligent script, and impressive special effects.
After being exposed to a radioactive cloud, Scott Carey (played by Grant Williams) discovers that his body is shrinking. As he grows smaller, his understanding of the world—and his role in it—also changes. At one point, he is forced to reside in a dollhouse and battle “giant” spiders and cats just to stay alive. Eventually he is reduced to the size of an atom.
Despite the outlandish premise, The Incredible Shrinking Man was one of the top science-fiction films of the 1950s because of the thought-provoking script by Richard Matheson and strong direction by Jack Arnold. The camera work and special effects were ingenious for their day and have continued to hold up well. The film inspired The Incredible Shrinking Woman (1981), which starred Lily Tomlin.
