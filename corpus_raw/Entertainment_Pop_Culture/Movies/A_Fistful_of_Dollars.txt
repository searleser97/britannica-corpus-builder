A Fistful of Dollars, Italian Per un pugno di dollari,  Italian western film, released in 1964, that popularized the “spaghetti western” subgenre and was a breakthrough movie for director Sergio Leone and star Clint Eastwood.
A mysterious stranger (played by Eastwood) drifts into a small Mexican town only to find a virtual war taking place between two powerful families: the Baxters and the Rojos. The opportunistic stranger concocts a plan to make money by working as a hired gun for both families. At one point he frees Marisol (Marianne Koch), a local woman who is being held as the unwilling mistress of Ramón Rojo (Gian Maria Volonté), and helps her flee the town with her husband and young son. This enrages Ramón, and the Rojos brutally beat and torture the stranger. However, he manages to escape, and Ramón, believing that the Baxters are protecting him, kills the family. The stranger subsequently returns and fatally shoots Ramón in a tense showdown before vanishing as mysteriously as he arrived.
A Fistful of Dollars was among the first spaghetti westerns to achieve major success. The landmark film, based on Akira Kurosawa’s Yojimbo (1961), was Leone’s second movie, and it made Eastwood an international star. His role as a ruthless and emotionless antihero was a defining one for the actor, who went on to play similar characters. Crude, underbudgeted, but engrossing, A Fistful of Dollars became a box-office hit when released in the United States in 1967. It spawned two sequels: For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), the latter of which is widely considered the best of the trilogy.
