The Philadelphia Story,  American romantic comedy film, released in 1940, focusing on manners and marriage and especially noted for its cast—Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, and Cary Grant.
The Philadelphia Story was based on a popular Broadway play that was written for Hepburn. In director George Cukor’s film adaptation, she reprised the role of Tracy Lord, an arrogant socialite whose ex-husband, C.K. Dexter Haven (played by Grant), appears as she is about to remarry. In hopes of winning her back, Haven tries to prevent a magazine from publishing a story about her womanizing father.
A critical and commercial success, The Philadelphia Story was vindication for Hepburn, who had been labeled “box office poison” several years earlier. For his performance as a tabloid reporter, Stewart won the Academy Award for best actor, though many believed this was consolation for his not receiving the award for his more acclaimed performance in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). The Philadelphia Story was remade in 1956 as the musical High Society, starring Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Grace Kelly.
