It Happened Here,  British war film, released in 1965, that was an outstanding achievement in independent filmmaking; the pseudodocumentary imagines what would have happened if Germany had defeated England during World War II.
The movie is set in 1944–45, with Britain under Nazi control. Pauline (Pauline Murray) is a nurse who tries to stay apolitical. However, when partisan activities lead to the evacuation of her small village, she is sent to London, where she is coerced into joining a German intelligence agency. Over time, however, she begins to question the morality of the Nazi movement as she sees British citizens being routinely targeted for arrest and harassment. Her determination to collaborate with guerrilla forces is reinforced when she realizes that the occupation government is initiating programs of genocide against sickly slave labourers.
It Happened Here was filmed over a period of some seven years by Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo, who were the movie’s directors, producers, and writers. Both were teenagers when they began working on the movie. Operating on a shoestring budget—the film reportedly cost approximately $20,000—Brownlow and Mollo used mostly amateur actors and were forced to forgo shooting for extended periods when funds ran out. Their perseverance paid off, however, as It Happened Here is one of the most compelling amateur films ever made—though it remains little seen. The stark black-and-white production earned particular praise for its authenticity.
