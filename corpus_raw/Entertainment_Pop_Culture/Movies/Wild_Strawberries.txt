Wild Strawberries, Swedish Smultronstället,  Swedish film drama, released in 1957, that was acclaimed for the lead performance of Victor Sjöström. It was director Ingmar Bergman’s first commercial success in the United States.
Revered medical doctor and professor Isak Borg (played by Sjöström) undertakes an extended car trip from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary university degree. He is joined by his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), with whom he has a prickly relationship. Their encounters with various people along the way spark a series of surrealistic flashbacks for the professor. He reevaluates key moments in his life and their significance to him while also pondering his impending death.
Sjöström had been one of the great actors and directors of the Swedish silent cinema. His film Körkarlen (The Phantom Carriage, 1921) was one of Bergman’s favourites and a major influence on Wild Strawberries, which was Sjöström’s final performance. Sjöström won much praise for bringing empathy to a character who has spent his life as a cold and insulated person. Bergman later said, “Wild Strawberries was no longer my film; it was Victor Sjöström’s!”
