Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,  American dramatic film, released in 1939, by director Frank Capra that angered the political establishment but won wide acclaim from the public and film industry.
The story concerns Jefferson Smith (played by James Stewart), a hokey, idealistic youth leader who is appointed to the U.S. Senate by his state’s political authorities on the assumption that he will be a pliable stooge. However, when he proposes a national youth camp on the site of a crooked land deal he was expected to approve, his benefactors—as well as the state’s senior senator (Claude Rains)—turn against him. Disillusioned by the corruption of Washington, Smith nearly leaves town but is persuaded by his secretary (Jean Arthur) to mount an impassioned challenge to the system in the form of a marathon filibuster. In the popular climactic scene, one of the few in film history that hinges on a legislative tactic, Smith successfully exposes the attempted graft and wins the day.
The unflattering depiction of government officials so infuriated real-life legislators that there were calls for the film to be banned. For its portrayal of American political corruption, it was called anti-American and communist; some deemed it propaganda that aided the efforts of the Axis countries at the start of World War II. Notably, Joseph P. Kennedy, then U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, sought to suppress its release abroad.
Critics and audiences responded far differently, and the inspiring, heartwarming film became a box-office hit in the United States and garnered 11 Academy Award nominations. Stewart would win the best actor Oscar the following year for his work in The Philadelphia Story, but many consider his role in Mr. Smith the best performance of his career. The film’s essential belief in the power of democracy was highlighted when, in 1942, several cinemas in France chose it as the final English-language motion picture to be shown before a Nazi-ordered ban was imposed.
