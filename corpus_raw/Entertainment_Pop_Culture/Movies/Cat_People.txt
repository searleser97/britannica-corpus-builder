Cat People,  American low-budget horror film, released in 1942, that was noted for its masterful use of shadows and low lighting to create suspense. The movie was a major box-office hit and later garnered a cult following.
Cat People opens with Serbian-born fashion designer Irena Dubrovna (played by Simone Simon) sketching a panther at a zoo. There she meets and befriends engineer Oliver Reed (Kent Smith). She later confesses to him that the cries of lions strangely calm her, though her presence has the opposite effect on animals: they retreat in terror. After her marriage to Reed, Irena is reluctant to consummate their relationship out of fear that she suffers from an ancient Serbian curse that causes her to turn into a vicious panther when aroused by passion. After several attacks and even a killing, Irena ventures to a zoo and opens the panther’s cage, ensuring her death and an end to the curse that plagues her.
Simon won high praise for her chilling yet sympathetic role as the cat woman. The movie was produced by Val Lewton, who made a number of influential horror films for RKO Radio Pictures. Cat People avoided standard horror film devices—Irena is never shown in cat form—and instead relied on suggestion and the moviegoer’s imagination.
