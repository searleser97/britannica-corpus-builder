Spartacus,  American epic adventure film, released in 1960, that recounts the story of a historical slave uprising (73–71 bce) against Rome. The movie, which starred Kirk Douglas and was directed by Stanley Kubrick, won widespread critical acclaim.
The film traces the story of the slave Spartacus (played by Douglas), who earns a reputation for courage as a gladiator while a possession of the wealthy Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov). The fiercely independent slave seeks freedom for himself and his downtrodden companions. He manages to escape and frees other slaves, forming a formidable army of rebels. With the citizens of Rome frightened by the rebellion, Gen. Marcus Licinius Crassus (Laurence Olivier) is assigned to crush the insurgents, but Spartacus and his army defeat the Romans in numerous battles. However, they are ultimately caught in an inescapable trap and are slaughtered. Spartacus is crucified, but as he is dying, he has the satisfaction of discovering that his wife Varinia (Jean Simmons) and their baby son have been granted freedom as citizens of Rome.
Determined to avoid the reputation of many Roman Empire epics as dumbed-down, Douglas (who was also one of the film’s producers) hired blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo to pen the screenplay for Spartacus. Trumbo’s own name, rather than a pseudonym, was credited, which helped break the McCarthy-era stigma that had victimized Trumbo and others. After the film’s premiere, the studio bowed to pressure and removed a suggestive bath sequence with homosexual overtones between Olivier and Tony Curtis. When the film received a high-profile restoration in 1991, the scene was restored; because the soundtrack was missing, Curtis redubbed his part, and Anthony Hopkins provided the voice of Olivier, who had died in 1989.
