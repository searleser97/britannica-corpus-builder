Masque of the Red Death, The,  American horror film, released in 1964, that was loosely based on two short stories by Edgar Allan Poe. The film afforded Vincent Price one of his most memorable film roles.
Satanist Prince Prospero (played by Price) resides comfortably in an opulent medieval European castle while the abused populace around him is devastated by a plague called the Red Death. He offers his castle to nobles as a refuge from the plague and kills anyone he suspects of carrying the disease. Prospero’s depraved nature is established through a series of sadistic games he forces his guests to play, many of which end in death. He orders his guests to attend a masked ball, instructing them not to wear red. When one of the attendees appears dressed in red nonetheless, Prospero mistakes that figure as an emissary from his master, Satan. He comes to suspect that this assumption is false, however, and upon tearing the mask from the stranger’s face, he finds his own blood-soaked image. The red-cloaked figure is the Red Death itself, who has come for the prince.
The Masque of the Red Death is one of the many film adaptations of Poe’s work undertaken by director Roger Corman. Price also starred in Corman’s adaptations of The House of Usher (1960), The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), and The Raven (1963), among others. The Masque of the Red Death is noted for the cinematography of Nicolas Roeg, who later became a successful director.
