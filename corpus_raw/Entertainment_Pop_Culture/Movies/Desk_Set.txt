Desk Set,  American romantic comedy film, released in 1957, that was the first colour movie featuring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. It was one of the earliest movies to deal with the issue of labour anxiety amid the advent of the computer age.
Tracy portrayed Richard Sumner, an efficiency expert sent to a television network to see if Bunny Watson (played by Hepburn) and her research department can be aided by technology, specifically by two room-size “electronic brains” (i.e., computers). Fearful for their jobs, the workers set out to show that a computer cannot replace them. In the process, Sumner and Watson fall in love. The researchers are ultimately proved correct when the computer sends pink slips to everyone in the company, including Sumner.
Desk Set, which was based on a 1955 play by William Marchant, represents the eighth screen pairing of Tracy and Hepburn. It follows the well-established formula of featuring them in a battle of wits that ends in romance. The computer featured in the movie was based on the UNIVAC, an early commercial computer that debuted in 1951.
