His Girl Friday,  American screwball comedy film, released in 1940, that was director Howard Hawks’s innovative remake of The Front Page (1931). The lightning-fast repartee and prickly courtship of the film’s two leads made it a classic in the genre.
Cary Grant played a self-centred newsman determined to keep his ex-wife and former star reporter (played by Rosalind Russell) on staff to help get the scoop on an escaped murderer. At the same time, he tries to prevent her marriage to the handsome but boring Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy).
The nonstop action and brisk pace of the film were groundbreaking, as the characters shouted out overlapping dialogue so fast that it became almost indiscernible. The first big-screen adaptation of The Front Page—which was originally a play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur—starred Pat O’Brien as hard-nosed journalist Hildebrand Johnson. For His Girl Friday, Hawks renamed the character Hildegaard Johnson and gave the part to Russell, introducing an element of antic romance to the classic newspaper film. Russell was widely praised for her role as the wisecracking, fast-talking, streetwise reporter.
