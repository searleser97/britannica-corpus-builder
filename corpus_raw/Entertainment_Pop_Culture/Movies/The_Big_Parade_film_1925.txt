The Big Parade,  American silent film, released in 1925, that was the first movie to depict the experiences of the ordinary enlisted man during World War I and that was one of the first major antiwar films.
The Big Parade, directed by King Vidor, centres on James Apperson (played by John Gilbert), a spoiled rich young man who is humbled by his experiences in World War I. The film traces his adventures, friendships, and a love affair with a charming French girl (Renée Adorée).
Routinely touted as one of the first and greatest antiwar films, Vidor’s film is a genuine epic and was one of the most sweeping productions of the silent era. Though the film was shot in Texas, Vidor captured well the gruesome nature of the trench warfare in France. (Some of the battle scenes were shot by George Hill after Vidor left the project.) Vidor not only humanized the German adversaries but also gave Gilbert the role that cemented him as one of the first genuine superstars. What makes The Big Parade of historical, as well as cinematic, importance is the fact that it was shot within a few years of the end of World War I, thus providing a fascinating look at how the war affected the American people. The film was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s highest-grossing movie to date, with revenues topping $5 million. At the Astor Theater in New York City, it played for an astounding 96 weeks.
