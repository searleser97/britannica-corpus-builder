Joseph Keppler,  (born February 1, 1838, Vienna, Austria—died February 19, 1894, New York, New York, U.S.), Austria-born American caricaturist and founder of Puck, the first successful humorous weekly in the United States.
Keppler studied art in Vienna. Following the Revolution of 1848, his father emigrated to the United States and settled in Missouri, where Joseph joined him in 1867. Two years later he established his first humorous weekly newspaper in St. Louis. It failed, and in 1870 he founded Puck, a German-language weekly that was also short-lived.
Keppler then moved to New York City, and by 1875 he was drawing cover cartoons for Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper. He broke with Leslie in 1876 and founded a second German-language Puck, which was so successful that in 1877 an English-language version was begun. The English version lasted until 1918, 22 years longer than the German. Initially Keppler drew all the cartoons for Puck, and, although later many other artists contributed, his influence remained strong. His cartoon “Forbidding the Banns,” published on behalf of anti-Garfield forces in the Garfield-Hancock presidential campaign of 1880, attracted widespread attention.
