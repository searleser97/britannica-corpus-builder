Saul Steinberg,  (born June 15 [June 28, New Style], 1914, Râmnicu Sărat, Romania—died May 12, 1999, New York, New York, U.S.), Romanian-born American cartoonist and illustrator, best known for his line drawings that suggest elaborate, eclectic doodlings.
Steinberg studied sociology and psychology at the University of Bucharest and architecture in Milan. From 1936 to 1939 he published his cartoons in Italian magazines. Settling in New York City in 1942, Steinberg worked as a freelance artist, cartoonist, and illustrator, mainly for The New Yorker magazine, and exhibited his drawings in Paris, New York City, and other cities. Steinberg’s subject matter ranged from the whimsical (e.g., a wicker chair overtaken by its curlicues) to the satirical (sinister, overgrown gadgets) to the philosophical (a tiny figure perched on a giant question mark balanced at the edge of an abyss).
