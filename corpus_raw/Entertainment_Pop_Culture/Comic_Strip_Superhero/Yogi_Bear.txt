Yogi Bear,  American cartoon character, a walking, talking bear in a necktie and porkpie hat who roamed fictional Jellystone National Park. His accoutrements and personality were based on the character of Ed Norton in Jackie Gleason’s television series The Honeymooners, and his byword was “Smarter than the average bear!”
Seemingly, though not officially, named in reference to baseball player Yogi Berra, Yogi Bear spent his days in search of food, which he usually obtained by gleefully snatching picnic baskets from park visitors. His cub sidekick, Boo Boo, typically more cautious and conscience-driven, usually reluctantly went along with Yogi’s capers. The two evaded justice at the hands of the stern Ranger Smith.
The character Yogi Bear, voiced by Daws Butler, was created by legendary animation team William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and first appeared as a supporting feature on The Huckleberry Hound Show in 1958. The character was so popular that in 1961 he received his own show, which was aired until 1988. He starred in a feature film, Hey There, It’s Yogi Bear, in 1964. In later decades, new television series transported him out of Jellystone to locales including the high seas and even outer space.
The Yogi Bear shows of the 1960s and ’70s were notable examples of Hanna-Barbera’s much-derided technique of “limited,” or reused, animation, which drastically reduced the number of original drawings required to film an episode. For example, the clean line created by Yogi’s signature shirt collar and tie enabled the studio to animate only his head in conversation scenes, leaving his body static. Nevertheless, the stories and characters won over several generations of viewers and could be viewed on cable television into the 21st century. A feature-film adaptation of the cartoon, starring Dan Aykroyd (as the voice of Yogi) and Justin Timberlake (Boo Boo), was released in 2010.
