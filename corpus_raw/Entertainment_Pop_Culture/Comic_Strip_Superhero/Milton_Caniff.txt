Milton Caniff, in full Milton Arthur Caniff,  (born Feb. 28, 1907, Hillsboro, Ohio, U.S.—died  April 3, 1988, New York, N.Y.), American comic-strip artist, originator of “Terry and the Pirates” and “Steve Canyon,” which were noted for their fine draftsmanship, suspense, and humour.
After graduating from Ohio State University, Columbus, in 1930, Caniff worked on a fantasy-adventure strip for the Associated Press in New York City. In 1934 he began drawing “Terry,” and for 12 years he continued to produce the highly popular strip, which was notable for the authentic details of its Oriental settings. During World War II he also produced “Male Call” for armed-services newspapers. At the end of the war Caniff left the syndicate that owned the copyright for “Terry” and in 1947 introduced “Steve Canyon,” about an adventurous pilot engaged in international intrigues who later became a U.S. Air Force officer in Korea and Vietnam.
