Conan the Barbarian,  fictional hero of pulp novels, comic books, and films whose fantasy adventures take place in a prehistoric past. Conan is an adventurer-warrior from Cimmeria who lives in the Hyborian age, an era that supposedly follows the disappearance of the mythical continent of Atlantis. Conan was created by American writer Robert E. Howard and first appeared in short stories published in Weird Tales magazine in the early 1930s. Howard’s single extended-length Conan tale, which was serialized (1935–36) as “The Hour of the Wolf,” was published after his death as the first Conan novel, Conan the Conqueror (1950). Other previously serialized stories and unpublished story fragments were edited by various people and published as The Sword of Conan (1952), The Coming of Conan (1953), King Conan (1953), Conan the Barbarian (1954), and Tales of Conan (1955).
From 1970 Conan appeared in his own Marvel comic book, with Barry Windsor Smith and Roy Thomas as the first designer-illustrator and writer, respectively.
The films Conan the Barbarian (1982) and Conan the Destroyer (1984), both starring the former bodybuilder and governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, contributed to the continuing popularity of the character. Another cinematic interpretation, also titled Conan the Barbarian, was released in 2011.
