Punch, in full Punch, orthe London Charivari,  English illustrated periodical published from 1841 to 1992 and 1996 to 2002, famous for its satiric humour and caricatures and cartoons. The first editors, of what was then a weekly radical paper, were Henry Mayhew, Mark Lemon, and Joseph Stirling Coyne. Among the most famous early members of the staff were the authors William Makepeace Thackeray and Thomas Hood and the illustrator-cartoonists John Leech and Sir John Tenniel.
The cover drawing by Richard Doyle was used from 1849 until 1956, when each issueâ€™s cover was made different and printed in colour, although the traditional figures of Punch and his dog Toby usually appeared somewhere. By the 1990s the magazine had lost its satiric bite and most of its readership, and it ceased publication in April 1992. It was revived in September 1996 but financial difficulties continued, and the magazine closed in May 2002.
