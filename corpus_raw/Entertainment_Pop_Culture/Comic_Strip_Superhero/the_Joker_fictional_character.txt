the Joker,  comic-book character and archnemesis of DC Comics’ superhero Batman. The Joker is noted for his clownlike appearance and sick humour.
The Joker, initially portrayed as a small-time crook, was disfigured and driven insane by an accident with toxic chemicals. He was depicted with chalk-white skin, ruby-red lips permanently fixed in a demonic grin, and bright green hair. He was created in 1940 by illustrator Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger; their collaborator Jerry Robinson also claimed credit for the character’s inspiration. Early stories portrayed him (post-accident) as a homicidal psychopath, but by the mid-1950s he had been softened into a thief whose crimes were also gags. In the 1960s the character devolved into outright camp in a farcical Batman television series.
In the 1970s, writer Denny O’Neil and artist Neal Adams revitalized the Joker’s image, making him once again a wickedly menacing killer. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s 1988 story The Killing Joke revised and complicated his origin, ultimately suggesting that he might be not only lying about his past but unsure of it himself. Stories from this era focused on the Joker’s insanity and explored his relationship with Batman, suggesting that the two were equally insane but channeled their energies in opposite directions.
The Joker has appeared in many media incarnations of Batman. Among the notable actors to portray him were Cesar Romero in the 1960s television series, Jack Nicholson in the film Batman (1989), Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight (2008), and Joaquin Phoenix in Joker (2019). Both Ledger and Phoenix won Academy Awards for their portrayals of the character.
