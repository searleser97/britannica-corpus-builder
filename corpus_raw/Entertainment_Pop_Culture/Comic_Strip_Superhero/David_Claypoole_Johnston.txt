David Claypoole Johnston,  (born March 1799, Philadelphiaâ€”died  Nov. 8, 1865, Dorchester, Mass., U.S.), American cartoonist who, strongly influenced by the English caricaturist George Cruikshank, produced imaginative and original drawings.
As a schoolboy, Johnston showed an interest in drawing, and in 1815 he was apprenticed to a successful Philadelphia engraver. Shortly afterward he began making caricatures, which he published himself. They were popular, but the subjects he ridiculed were influential, and so he switched to an acting career. He first appeared on the stage in 1821, and for several years he played with a Philadelphia company. In 1825 he joined a Boston company, and along with his acting he made caricatures, particularly of actors and actresses. After a year he decided to devote himself to drawing and to book illustration. He quickly became popular, particularly as a lithographer.
Beginning in 1830 and until 1849, Johnston annually issued a series of humorous etchings under the title Scraps, and it was because of these that he came to be called the American Cruikshank.
