Robert L. Ripley, in full Robert LeRoy Ripley, original name LeRoy Robert Ripley,  (born February 22?, 1890, Santa Rosa, California, U.S.—died May 27, 1949, New York, New York), American cartoonist who was the founder of “Believe It or Not!,” a widely popular newspaper cartoon presenting bizarre facts and oddities of all kinds.
Sources differ on Ripley’s birthdate, which he reported inconsistently. After his father’s early death, he dropped out of high school to help support his family. A potential career as a baseball player ended because of an arm injury he sustained while trying out for the major leagues, and so he turned to his other main talent, drawing cartoons. Beginning at age 16, he held jobs as a sports cartoonist with several San Francisco newspapers, and he moved to New York City in 1913. There he drew cartoons for the New York Globe, and he originated his first “Believe It or Not!” cartoon for that paper’s issue of December 19, 1918; this cartoon portrayed nine oddities from the world of athletics. Reader response to this format was overwhelming, and “Believe It or Not!” began appearing in a weekly and then a daily format.
Ripley moved his cartoon to the New York Evening Post in 1923 and reached national prominence in 1929, when William Randolph Hearst’s King Features Syndicate picked up his cartoon for syndication in almost 300 American newspapers. Ripley’s first book-length collection of his sketches, Believe It or Not! (1929), was followed in the 1930s by several others. He also made a series of “Believe It or Not!” film shorts, as well as several series of radio programs, and he sponsored exhibits called “Odditoriums” where curiosities were displayed in a carnival-like atmosphere. His original cartoon was continued by others after his death in 1949.
