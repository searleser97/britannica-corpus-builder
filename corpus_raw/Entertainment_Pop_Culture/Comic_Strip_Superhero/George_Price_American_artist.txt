George Price,  (born June 9, 1901, Coytesville, N.J., U.S.—died  Jan. 12, 1995, Englewood, N.J.), American cartoonist whose work, characterized by witty, imaginative drawing and brief, often one-line captions, helped to modernize the magazine cartoon.
As a young man Price did odd jobs in printing offices and did freelance illustrations. During the 1920s he was active in advertising art. Much of the humour in his cartoons lay in having a character respond rationally to a wildly improbable situation. His first success, for example, was a series involving the droll responses of a man floating in air.
In 1926 Price became a contributor to The New Yorker. Many of his cartoons also appeared in Collier’s and The Saturday Evening Post. Popular collections of his cartoons were published, beginning with Good Humor Man (1940) and including Who’s in Charge Here? (1943), My Dear 500 Friends (1963), The People Zoo (1971), Browse At Your Own Risk (1977), and The World of George Price (1987).
