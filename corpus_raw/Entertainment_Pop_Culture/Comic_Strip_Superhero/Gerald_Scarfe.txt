Gerald Scarfe,  (born June 1, 1936, London, England), English caricaturist best known for his savagely grotesque portraits of politicians and other public figures.
For most of his first 19 years Scarfe was bedridden with chronic asthma, and he began to draw during these long periods of confinement. After a brief, uncongenial period with an advertising agency, he became a freelance artist, and his early work was accepted by the Evening Standard, Punch, and, particularly, Private Eye in the 1960s.
In 1966 the publication of a collection of his drawings, Gerald Scarfe’s People, revealed a wide range of subject matter and technique. Of the portraits, some were quite realistic while others, such as those of the novelist Somerset Maugham and of the duke and duchess of Windsor, were wildly distorted. Some had full shading while others were in line drawings. Commenting on his use of distortion, he said, “I like to see how far I can stretch a face and still leave it recognizable.” In 1969 he began to do animation and film directing for the British Broadcasting Corporation.
