Boardman Robinson,  (born Sept. 6, 1876, Somerset, Nova Scotia, Can.—died  Sept. 5, 1952, Stamford, Conn, U.S.), Canadian-American illustrator and painter noted for his political cartoons.
As a student in Paris in 1898, first at the Académie Colarossi, then the École des Beaux Arts, Robinson was influenced by the great tradition of French political cartooning that was begun by Honoré Daumier. Returning to the United States, he published trenchant cartoons in a number of newspapers and periodicals, including the Socialist Masses, as well as The Liberator and Harper’s Weekly. During World War I his reputation was established by his powerful and searching cartoons that focused on the human suffering caused by the war and on the war guilt of the German government.
As a teacher at the Art Students League, New York City (1919–30), and as a founder and head of the Colorado Springs (Colo.) Fine Arts Center (1936–47), he taught many outstanding artists. Robinson illustrated editions of Edgar Lee Masters’ Spoon River Anthology (1941), Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov (1933), and Herman Melville’s Moby Dick (1942). He also created the murals in the Department of Justice Building in Washington, D.C.
