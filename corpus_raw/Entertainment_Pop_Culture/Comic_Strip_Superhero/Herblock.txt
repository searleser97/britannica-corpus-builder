Herblock, byname of Herbert Lawrence Block,  (born October 13, 1909, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.—died October 7, 2001, Washington, D.C.), American editorial cartoonist who won Pulitzer Prizes in 1942, 1954, and 1979.
Herblock’s first cartoons appeared in the Chicago Daily News in 1929. He worked for the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) from 1933 to 1943 and joined The Washington Post in 1946. A leading cartoon spokesman of liberalism, Herblock attacked injustices in politics, big business, industry, labour, and economics. He is probably best known for his cartoons of the early 1950s attacking the threat of native fascism as personified by Senator Joseph McCarthy. As a recurring menace, McCarthy rivaled another favourite Herblock character, a personified “clean” atom bomb. Other notable cartoons are his depictions of Russian premier Joseph Stalin and U.S. President Richard Nixon. His works include The Herblock Book (1952), Herblock’s Here and Now (1955), The Herblock Gallery (1968), Herblock on All Fronts (1980), and other collections of cartoons. His autobiography, Herblock: A Cartoonist’s Life, appeared in 1993. In 1994 he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
