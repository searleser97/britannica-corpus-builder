Sir John Tenniel,   (born February 28, 1820, London, England—died February 25, 1914, London), English illustrator and satirical artist, especially known for his work in Punch and his illustrations for Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1872).
Tenniel attended the Royal Academy schools and in 1836 sent his first picture to the exhibition of the Society of British Artists. In 1845 he contributed a 16-foot cartoon to the competition of designs for mural decoration of the new Palace of Westminster and received £100 and a commission for a fresco in the Upper Waiting Hall (or “Hall of Poets”) in the House of Lords. In 1850 he was invited to succeed Richard Doyle as joint cartoonist with John Leech for Punch, a periodical Tenniel worked on for most of his life. Gradually he took over altogether the weekly drawing of the political “big cut.” In his drawings for Punch Tenniel lent new dignity to the political cartoon. His most famous cartoon was probably “Dropping the Pilot” (1890), on the subject of Bismarck’s resignation. Tenniel was knighted in 1893 and retired from Punch in 1901. He illustrated many books; his drawings for Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass are remarkably subtle and clever and are extremely well-suited to Lewis Carroll’s text. These illustrations won him an international reputation and a continuing audience.
