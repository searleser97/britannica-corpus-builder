Zhu, Wade-Giles romanization chu,  ancient Chinese struck half-tube zither, now obsolete. Early forms had five strings that appear to have been struck with a bamboo stick. The instrument was narrow and slightly convex on top, and the strings were passed over bridges (possibly movable) at both ends. Surviving examples range in length from about 93 cm to about 118 cm (36 to 46 inches). It was one of several zithers used in ancient China; others included the qin, se, and zheng, all of which have remained in use.
The zhu first appeared no later than the Warring States period (475–221 bc). It seems to have been used for entertainment, both as a solo instrument and in ensembles. Later variations had a wider body and more strings (at least 13), but there is no evidence that the instrument was in use after the Tang dynasty (ad 618–907). Twentieth-century excavations have brought to light several zhu, among many other musical instruments. Burial objects (small or unplayable models) were found in the well-known tomb of Zenghouyi (Marquis Yi of Zeng; dated 433 bc) in Hubei province; in the Yuyang tomb, in Changsha, Hunan province (dated from the 3rd century bc; actual instruments were also found); and in a tomb at Mawang Dui, Hunan province (dated 168 bc).
The word zhu, sounding the same but written differently in Chinese, appears in connection with an idiophone. This instrument was shaped like a box with outward-sloping sides and an open top. It was struck on the inside with a bamboo beater. Examples survive from the Qing dynasty (ad 1644–1911/12).
