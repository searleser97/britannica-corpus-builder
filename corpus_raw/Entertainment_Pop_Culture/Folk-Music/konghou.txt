Konghou, Wade-Giles romanization k’ung-hou,  Chinese multistringed, plucked instrument of the harp family. The sound box of a konghou resembles that of a pipa. On each side of the sound box is a row of bridges over which 36 to 44 strings are stretched. A device that is fixed to the bridges coordinates the two groups of strings in movements of pressing, kneading, trilling, and sliding. Its range usually includes five and one-half octaves centred approximately at middle C. Its music is characterized by tension-altering embellishments, glissandos, arpeggiated chords, and register contrast. In its heyday it existed in three main types, the vertical, the horizontal, and the phoenix-headed.
The konghou was initially believed to have first appeared in the Han period (206 bc–ad 220), but several examples of early konghous—some dating to about 1000 bc—have since been excavated. It was a popular orchestral and solo instrument until about the 14th century, when its popularity declined, and it virtually disappeared. It began to be reproduced in the mid-20th century and was used by several traditional orchestras.
