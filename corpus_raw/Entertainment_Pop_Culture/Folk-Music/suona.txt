Suona, Wade-Giles romanization so-na, also called laba,  Chinese double-reed woodwind instrument, the most commonly used double-reed instrument. Similar to the shawm, the suona originated in Arabia; it has been widely used in China since the 16th century. The reed is affixed to a conical wooden body covered by a copper tube with eight finger holes (seven in front and one in back), to which is fitted a brass bell. Its range is generally about two octaves, and it comes in many sizes. The suona is characterized by its shrill and penetrating sound and the frequent use of tonguing in performance. It is much used in military music ensembles and religious processions and as a stage instrument in Chinese operas.
