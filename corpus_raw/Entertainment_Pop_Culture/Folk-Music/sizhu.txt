Sizhu, (Chinese: “silk and bamboo”)  Wade-Giles romanization szu-chu,  any of the traditional Chinese chamber music ensembles made up of stringed and wind instruments. Silk (strings) and bamboo (winds) were two of the materials of the bayin (“eight sounds”) classification system established during the Xi (Western) Zhou dynasty (1046–771 bc); the others were metal, stone, earth, skin, wood, and gourd.
The term sizhu is a 20th-century term that refers to the folk ensembles that first appeared in the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911/12) dynasties and have continued to the present day. Many regional variants exist, but the most influential has been the Jiangnan sizhu, which in the 19th century became established south of the Yangtze River, especially in the cities of southeast Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang provinces. By the early part of the 20th century, Shanghai had become the centre of sizhu activities; the city’s elite organized numerous amateur clubs that played for social functions and for their own entertainment. The Shanghai sizhu became the basis of the modern Chinese orchestra in the mid-20th century.
Normally a Jiangnan sizhu ensemble consists of three to seven or eight players. The dominant silk instruments are the erhu (spike fiddle), small sanxian (long-necked fretless lute), pipa (short-necked fretted lute), and yangqin (struck zither); the dominant bamboo instruments are di (transverse flute), xiao (vertical flute), and sheng (mouth organ), all very common Chinese instruments. Additional instruments, such as zhonghu (a larger relative of the erhu), may be used. Small percussion instruments, such as a small drum, clappers, or handbells, may be played by the person who beats time. The repertoire and style of the ensembles follow tradition, although new music is also composed.
