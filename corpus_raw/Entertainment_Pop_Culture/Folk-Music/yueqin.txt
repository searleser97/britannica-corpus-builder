Yueqin, Wade-Giles romanization yüeh-ch’in also called moon guitar,  Chinese lute, one of a family of flat, round-bodied lutes found in Central and East Asia. The yueqin, which evolved from the ruan, has a length of some 18 inches (about 45 cm), with a short neck and a round resonator that is some 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter. It has two pairs of silk strings, tuned (in relative pitch) to c–g, which run from a fastener on the wooden belly to tuning pegs set in the sides of the pegbox. The strings are plucked by either the fingers or a small plectrum. The instrument’s characteristic sound is produced when a metal plate that is hung inside the body vibrates against it when the instrument is played. The modern yueqin is generally larger than the traditional instrument, extending to about 26 inches (67 cm), and its 3 or 4 strings—not in pairs—are made of nylon-wrapped steel. The yueqin was invented, according to tradition, during the Jin dynasty, between about ad 265 and 420. The instrument is often included in jingxi (folk opera) orchestras. It is also used as a solo instrument.
