Gu, Wade-Giles romanization ku,  any of several sizes and shapes of Chinese drum, with a body that is usually made of wood and a head that is usually made of animal skin. Two-headed gu may be barrel-shaped, cylindrical, or hourglass-shaped. Single-headed gu, such as the bangu, may be in the shape of a deep or shallow basin. Sizes vary from folk instruments that fit easily in one hand to ceremonial instruments more than 2 metres (61/2 feet) in diameter. Some are played with bare hands, others with sticks wielded by one or two performers. Specialized gu have developed for different occasions and types of ensembles. Luogu, the combination of drums with gongs (luo), is very common and has its own specialized notation.
