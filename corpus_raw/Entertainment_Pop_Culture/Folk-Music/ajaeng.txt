Ajaeng,  large Korean bowed zither having seven strings. Its body is about 160 cm (62 inches) long and 25 cm (10 inches) wide and is made of paulownia wood. The ajaeng’s strings, made of twisted silk, are supported by separate movable bridges. The bow with which it is played, some 65 cm (25 inches) long, is fashioned from a peeled forsythia branch that has been hardened with pine resin.
The instrument, which is placed in a transverse position on the floor, is supported on its bowed end by a stand. The player sits on the floor behind it and moves the bow over the strings to the right of the bridges while the left hand varies pitch and vibrato by pressing the strings on the other side of the bridges. Characteristically the tone of the ajaeng is raspy, and its melodies are highly inflected and expressive.
Derived from the Chinese yazheng, the ajaeng arrived in Korea from China during the Koryŏ dynasty (918–1392). Usually paired with the haegŭm, it plays the traditional Korean court music of both the Chinese-derived (tang-ak) and the Korean (hyang-ak) styles, each of which has a characteristic pentatonic tuning. The modern ajaeng sanjo is basically a smaller version of the ajaeng, about 120 cm (47 inches) long, and it has eight strings. The ajaeng sanjo is used for a variety of genres, including sanjo (virtuosic solo music), folk songs, and shaman ensembles.
