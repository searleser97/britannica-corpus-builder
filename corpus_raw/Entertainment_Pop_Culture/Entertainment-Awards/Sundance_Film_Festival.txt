Sundance Film Festival,  independent-film festival held in Park City, Utah, each January. It is one of the most respected and celebrated film festivals in the United States.
The Sundance Film Festival began in September 1978 in Salt Lake City, Utah, under the name Utah/United States Film Festival. The idea was launched by the Utah Film Commission as a means to promote independent film and to bring the state of Utah to the attention of filmmakers. Actor and director Robert Redford, who lived in Utah, was appointed the first chairman of the festival board, and his involvement helped raise awareness and funds for the new festival.
Although well received by attendees, the festival struggled financially in its first two years. In 1980, hoping to attract more people by hosting the festival at a ski resort in winter, the committee changed the venue to nearby Park City and the date to the following January. The changes proved popular, but money problems persisted, and in 1985 the festival came under the auspices of Redfordâ€™s Sundance Institute, which he had started with the mission of nurturing and developing independent filmmakers. After several name changes, the festival became known as the Sundance Film Festival in 1991. By the early 1990s, the festival had developed a reputation for jump-starting the careers of American independent filmmakers, including the Coen brothers, Steven Soderbergh, and Quentin Tarantino.
The festival shows approximately 200 films during its 10-day run and offers prizes in several categories of competition. Among these honours are the Grand Jury Prize, which is awarded for documentaries and dramatic films originating in the United States, and the World Cinema Jury Prize, given for documentaries and dramatic films originating elsewhere. Audience Awards are also bestowed in the same four categories. In addition to screening films, the Sundance Film Festival hosts panel discussions, workshops, musical events, and parties for the approximately 50,000 attendees, who include both industry insiders and the filmgoing public.
