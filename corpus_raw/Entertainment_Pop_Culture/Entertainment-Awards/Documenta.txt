Documenta,  German art festival held every five years in Kassel, Ger. It showcases contemporary art, using a variety of venues throughout the city.
Documenta began as a postwar attempt at revitalization. Heavily bombed by the Allies during World War II, the city lay largely in ruins; more than 70 percent of the residences and 65 percent of the industrial areas had been destroyed. After a failed bid for Kassel to become the provisional federal capital, its citizens saw a fresh opportunity to rebuild. In 1955, when the Bundesgartenschau (“Federal Garden Show”) was held in their city, they launched the first Documenta exhibition, in which they showcased paintings (the so-called degenerate art) that had been suppressed under the Nazi regime. The festival’s first artistic director, Arnold Bode, staged the exhibit at the ruins of the Museum Fridericianum in order to present a symbolic rising from the ashes of World War II.
The first Documenta was a success, attracting people from around the world, so a second was arranged for 1959. Documenta 2 featured art that had been created after 1945, and it benefited from a partnership with New York’s Museum of Modern Art, which sent nearly 100 artworks to the exhibition. The second festival included sculpture and prints, and many outdoor exhibit areas were set up. Documenta was convened irregularly every four or five years until 1972, when a regular schedule was established. Now held every five years, the exhibit is open for 100 days, earning it the nickname “The Museum of 100 Days.”
Bode was artistic director for the first three Documentas, but since then a different director has been named for each subsequent exhibition. Documenta 12, held in 2007, was attended by more than 750,000 people, about a third of whom traveled from other countries. In addition to presenting the work of more than 100 artists, Documenta 12 offered daily lectures, films, workshops, and presentations.
