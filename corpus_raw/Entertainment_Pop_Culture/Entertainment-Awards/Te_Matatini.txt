Te Matatini, in full Te Matatini National Kapa Haka Festival, originally called Polynesian Festival,  biennial New Zealand festival highlighting traditional Maori culture, especially the performing arts.
The festival was called by a variety of names after its inception in 1972 and has been known since 2004 as Te Matatini, which in the Maori language means “The Many Faces.” It is also the name of the festival’s sponsoring organization, and it reflects the diversity of both the kapa haka (literally “row dance”; see also haka) competitors and their audience. Te Matatini is hosted by a different region of New Zealand each time it is held and lasts three to four days. Over that period, regional winners of kapa haka competitions in New Zealand and Australia compete to gain the national title.
Kapa haka competition consists of 10 disciplines combining a variety of singing and posture dances, all of which are judged according to set criteria, including clothing and skill and clarity of language use. The event culminates with the tallying of points, the awarding of prizes in many categories, and the announcement of an overall winning team. In addition to observing the competition, visitors can buy Maori arts and crafts, sample Maori cuisine, and learn about Maori history and culture. In the early 21st century, visitors to Te Matatini numbered in the tens of thousands.
