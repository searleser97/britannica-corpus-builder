The Fringe, official name Edinburgh Festival Fringe,  Edinburgh arts festival that presents a variety of plays, performances, and exhibitions for three weeks every August. It is one of several annual festivals held in Edinburgh.
The Fringe began in 1947, concurrently with the Edinburgh International Festival, an invitation-only festival. In that first year eight theatre troupes who had not been invited to perform arrived on the scene, arranged a performance space, and put on their shows during the run of the official festival. Their efforts were fruitful, and the following year even more unofficial participants were present. Because they operated within venues on the margins of the official festival, the alternative scene became known as the Fringe (later Edinburgh Festival Fringe).
Since its origins the Fringe has become somewhat more structured, though it still eschews the invitation-only model. A Fringe Society was formed in 1959 to organize the growing event. Performers and theatre groups that register with the Fringe Society are listed in an official program and are able to sell tickets through the central box office. Unregistered participants are still welcome, however, and anyone with a venue can put on a show. As a result of this policy, a wide variety of shows are available, including children’s shows, comedy, dance, opera, musicals, plays, acrobatics displays, workshops, and buskers.
The Fringe—which has continued to grow—runs for three weeks each August (overlapping with the Edinburgh International Festival for two of those weeks), and it averages more than 2,000 shows and more than 32,000 performances.
