Monterey Jazz Festival,  annual jazz festival held at the Monterey County Fairgrounds, in the coastal town of Monterey, west-central California, U.S.
The Monterey Jazz Festival was founded by James L. Lyons, a jazz disc jockey in San Francisco, and jazz critic Ralph J. Gleason. Inspired by Rhode Island’s Newport Jazz Festival, the two jazz enthusiasts garnered enough support to launch a comparable event in 1958. That event—the first Monterey Jazz Festival—featured such performers as vocalist Billie Holiday, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Armstrong, pianist Dave Brubeck, percussionist Max Roach, and saxophonist Gerry Mulligan. The festival was well received, and it subsequently became an annual event, held on the last full weekend of September. Lyons continued to manage the festival until his retirement in 1992.
From its inception the Monterey Jazz Festival presented a broad spectrum of jazz styles—from big-band to avant-garde—and over the years its scope expanded to embrace blues, gospel, and related genres, as well as various types of world music. By the early 21st century the festival featured hundreds of acts, with concurrent performances occurring on multiple stages. The program was further enriched by workshops, exhibits, music clinics, and other activities. Attendance often exceeded 40,000.
Promotion of jazz education has remained a primary concern of the festival. Proceeds from the event have funded high school jazz competitions, artist-in-residence programs, summer music camps for youth, the Next Generation Jazz Orchestra for young musicians, and an instrument and sheet-music library for use by schools. The festival also provides scholarships for promising musicians to study jazz at the university level, and it commissions new jazz compositions annually. The archive of recordings that chronicles the history of the Monterey Jazz Festival is housed at Stanford University.
