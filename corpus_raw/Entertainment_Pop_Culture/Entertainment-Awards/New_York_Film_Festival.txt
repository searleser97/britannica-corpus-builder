New York Film Festival,  noncompetitive film festival held annually at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. It is considered to be one of the most prestigious film festivals in the United States.
The New York Film Festival was first held in 1963 and featured films from the United States and from countries around the world. Its organizer, Richard Roud, had been inspired by the success of the London Film Festival, for which he served as program director. Among the inaugural festival’s selections were films by Robert Bresson, Ozu Yasujirō, and Roman Polanski.
The festival is limited to films never before shown in New York City; additionally, movies selected for the opening and closing nights are required to be North American debuts. The New York Film Festival shows fewer films than many contemporary festivals, with an average of about 28 feature films and a dozen short films screened over 17 days. Film at Lincoln Center (formerly the Film Society of Lincoln Center) hosts the festival, and a selection committee of five people chooses the films from more than 1,500 entrants. The committee often privileges films that it thinks will challenge the audience. Because the process itself is so selective, the organization offers no prizes during the festival.
In addition to showcasing new films, the festival hosts discussions, lectures, and special screenings. In 2009, for example, the festival showed a remastered print of The Wizard of Oz (1939), which was followed by a discussion panel that featured film historians and restorers. In 1997 a “sidebar” program called Views from the Avant-Garde (renamed Projections in 2014), devoted to experimental film, was introduced. Other recurring subcategories, including Spotlight on Documentary and Convergence, were introduced throughout the 2010s.
