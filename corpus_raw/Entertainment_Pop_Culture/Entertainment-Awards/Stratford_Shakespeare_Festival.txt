Stratford Shakespeare Festival,  Canadian summer theatrical festival in Stratford, Ontario. It was founded by the journalist Tom Patterson in 1953; among its first artistic directors was Tyrone Guthrie. It includes four permanent theatres: the open-stage Festival Theatre, the Avon Theatre, the Tom Patterson Theatre, and the Studio Theatre. Its name has varied since its founding to reflect the festival’s shifting priorities, but it has consistently featured productions of William Shakespeare’s plays (Stratford was chosen as its locale because the town’s name matched that of Shakespeare’s birthplace). Other classic as well as modern dramatic works are also performed.
