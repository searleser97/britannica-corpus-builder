Gregorio Martínez Sierra,  (born May 6, 1881, Madrid—died  Oct. 1, 1947, Madrid), poet and playwright whose dramatic works contributed significantly to the revival of the Spanish theatre.
Martínez Sierra’s first volume of poetry, El poema del trabajo (1898; “The Poem of Work”), appeared when he was 17. Short stories reflecting the Modernist concern with individuality and subjectivity and freedom from archaic forms followed. He turned to drama in 1905 with his Teatro de ensueño (“Theatre of Dreams”). His masterpiece, Canción de cuna (1911; “Song of the Cradle”), was popular in both Spain and Spanish America. The most marked feature of his drama, his insight into his female characters, has been attributed to his wife, María de la O Lejárraga, who collaborated with him and wrote a book on their collaboration, Gregorio y yo (1953; “Gregory and I”).
A man of enormous energy, Martínez Sierra also edited several important Modernist periodicals in Madrid and operated Renacimiento, a publishing house that introduced a host of foreign playwrights into Spain, including George Bernard Shaw, James Barrie, and Luigi Pirandello. Martínez Sierra himself translated the works of Shakespeare and the Belgian playwright Maurice Maeterlinck. His most important contribution to the Spanish theatre was his introduction of the art theatre while he was director of the Eslava Theatre in Madrid (1917–28). His work there is described in his book Un teatro de arte en España (1926; “An Art Theatre in Spain”). His popularity waned after his death.
