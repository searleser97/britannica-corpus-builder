Sven Nykvist,  (born December 3, 1922, Moheda, Sweden—died September 20, 2006, Stockholm), Swedish cinematographer best known for his subtle, luminous camera work in the films of Ingmar Bergman.
Nykvist studied photography, worked as an assistant cameraman, and spent a year at the Italian Cinecittà studios before joining the Swedish production company Sandrews in 1941. He shot his first film in 1945 and his first for Bergman, Gycklarnas afton (The Naked Night, or Sawdust and Tinsel), in 1953. In 1960 he worked on Bergman’s Jungfrukällan (The Virgin Spring), after which he became Bergman’s regular director of photography at Svensk Filmindustri. He worked on more than a dozen Bergman films, including Viskningar och rop (1972; Cries and Whispers) and Fanny och Alexander (1982; Fanny and Alexander), for both of which he won Oscars in cinematography.
In working with Bergman, Nykvist typically operated the camera himself in order to be in close touch with the director’s instructions. He shared Bergman’s passion for light, eschewing technical gloss in favour of an expressive simplicity that directly conveys the austere beauty of the Swedish landscape. Nykvist also worked with most of the other important Swedish directors and with Woody Allen, Louis Malle, and Roman Polanski. His many international productions include Black Moon (1975), Pretty Baby (1978), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), and What’s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). His last film, Curtain Call (also known as It All Came True), was released in 1998. Nykvist also directed movies and wrote several screenplays.
