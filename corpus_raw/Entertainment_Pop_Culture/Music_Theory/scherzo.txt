Scherzo, plural scherzos or scherzi,  in music, frequently the third movement of a symphony, sonata, or string quartet; also, in the Baroque era (c. 1600–c. 1750), a light vocal or instrumental piece (e.g., the Scherzi musicali of Claudio Monteverdi, 1607), and, in the 19th century, an independent orchestral composition. In symphonies, sonatas, and string quartets of the 19th century, the scherzo replaced the 18th-century minuet. Unlike the rather stately minuet, originally a dance of the aristocracy, the scherzo in rapid 3/4 time was replete with elements of surprise in dynamics and orchestration.
Both the minuet and scherzo contain a contrasting section, the trio, following which the minuet or scherzo returns according to the format ABA. The reiterated or abrupt rhythms in some of Joseph Haydn’s minuets clearly anticipate the scherzo as developed by Beethoven; in his six quartets, Opus 33 (Russian Quartets, or Gli scherzi), Haydn actually used the term. Beethoven wrote scherzos for nearly all of his nine symphonies, although he used the label only in the second and the third.
In the 19th century the scherzo was not necessarily bound to larger works, but it was still a characteristically swift-moving piece of music. Brilliant effects of orchestration and exhilarating rhythms in a swift tempo characterize Felix Mendelssohn’s scherzo from his Midsummer Night’s Dream, while in the four piano scherzos of Frédéric Chopin dramatic, somewhat dark moods alternate with more lyrical trios. A later Romantic example is Paul Dukas’s The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, a “scherzo based on a ballad of Goethe,” and in the early 20th century Igor Stravinsky wrote his Scherzo à la Russe, set first for jazz band and later for full orchestra.
