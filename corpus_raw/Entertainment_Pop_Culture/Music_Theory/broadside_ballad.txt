Broadside ballad,   a descriptive or narrative verse or song, commonly in a simple ballad form, on a popular theme, and sung or recited in public places or printed on broadsides for sale in the streets.
Broadside ballads appeared shortly after the invention of printing in the 15th century and were hawked in streets, fairs, and marketplaces of Europe into the 19th century. Typical broadsides included hack-written topical ballads on recent crimes, executions, or disasters. Many ballads passed into the oral tradition from broadside origins. Although older texts were often “beautified” by the addition of flowery, sentimental, or moralizing language, broadsides also preserved versions of traditional ballads that might otherwise have disappeared from popular tradition. See also good-night.
