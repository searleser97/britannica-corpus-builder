Villota, plural villote,  type of 16th-century Italian secular song similar to the villanella but having its origins in folk music. The villota has no structural uniformity and usually weaves a popular or street song into its textual and musical fabric. Three features characterize the villota and reveal its utility as an entertainment medium: the presence of nonsense syllables, the often bawdy text, and the dancelike rhythm of the music. Longer and more complex villote frequently will conclude with a nio, a separate section that acts as a refrain and is set off from the main part (or verse) by its faster tempo, and occasionally, contrasting metre. Villote often reveal their local origin, either by means of a dialect employed or by regional identifications, as in villote alla paduana (Padua), alla veneziana (Venice), or alla mantovana (Mantua).
