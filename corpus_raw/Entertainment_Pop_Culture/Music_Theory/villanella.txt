Villanella, plural villanelle,  16th-century Italian rustic part-song, usually for three unaccompanied voices, having no set form other than the presence of a refrain. The villanella was most often written in chordal style with clear, simple rhythm. Traditional rules of composition were sometimes broken; for instance, the normally forbidden movement of voices in parallel fifths was common in the villanella. The villanella was not a folk form but a reaction against the more refined madrigal, often parodying well-known madrigal texts and music.
The villanella originated in Naples and hence was also called villanella alla napoletana. Although some villanelle appeared earlier, the form was most important during the second half of the 16th century, and it maintained its popularity until about 1700. The earliest master of the genre was Giovan Tommaso di Maio (died c. 1550); its most important composer was Gian Domenico da Nola (died 1592). Although the villanella was a reaction against the madrigal, some of the best examples were written by such composers of madrigals as Adriaan Willaert, Orlando di Lasso, and Luca Marenzio. It was closely related to several other Italian light vocal forms, including the mascherata, moresca greghesca, villota, and giustiniana.
