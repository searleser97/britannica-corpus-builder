In nomine,  style of 16th- and 17th-century English instrumental ensemble music based on the plainsong melody of the antiphon (a verse originally sung before and after a psalm in the Roman Catholic liturgy) “Gloria tibi Trinitas” (“Glory to Thee, O Trinity”) from the Vesper service for Trinity Sunday. The In nomine was named after John Taverner’s setting of the In nomine Domini (“In the name of the Lord”) section from the Benedictus (a hymn of praise or thanksgiving) of his mass Gloria tibi Trinitas. He created an independent composition from this section of the Benedictus, with arrangements for vocalists, vocalists and instrumentalists, and keyboard or consort. Taverner’s In nomine Domini served as a model for similar works by such composers as Christopher Tye, Thomas Tallis, and John Bull. Although instrumental styles changed, the title and plainsong melody remained in use through the time of Henry Purcell (1659–95).
