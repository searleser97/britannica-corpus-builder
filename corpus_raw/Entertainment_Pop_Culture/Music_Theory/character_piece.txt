Character piece,  relatively brief musical composition, usually for piano, expressive of a specific mood or nonmusical idea. Closely associated with the Romantic movement, especially in Germany, 19th-century character pieces often bore titles citing their inspiration from literature (such as Robert Schumann’s collection Kreisleriana, 1838) or from personal experience (e.g., Schumann’s Kinderszenen, 1838; Scenes from Childhood). Others refer to specific personages directly or in disguise (such as Schumann’s Carnaval, composed 1833–35) or evoke geographic or national images (e.g., Frédéric Chopin’s polonaises, mazurkas, and Barcarolle, 1845–46). Felix Mendelssohn’s Lieder ohne Worte (1830; Songs Without Words) covered a particularly wide range of styles and moods, while Chopin tended to favour musico-literary genres, such as ballades, and more-generalized idyllic or melancholy associations, such as nocturnes. Many, though by no means all, character pieces are relatively simple in design, emphasizing expressive melody and harmony, not unlike the contemporaneous German lied. Although they may feature elaborate keyboard figurations, especially in Chopin’s case, the 19th-century character piece may be identified as an instrumental song intended, like its German vocal counterpart, primarily for home rather than concert performance.
Antecedents of the 19th-century character piece abound especially in French keyboard music, in which the perennial tendency to link music with extramusical subject matter accounted for a host of titled harpsichord pieces as early as the 17th century. The clavecin (harpsichord) works of François Couperin and Jean-Philippe Rameau represent the first culmination of a French tradition pursued by Emmanuel Chabrier, Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, and Maurice Ravel, among many others, well into the 20th century.
