Gigue, (French: “jig”) Italian giga,  popular Baroque dance that originated in the British Isles and became widespread in aristocratic circles of Europe; also a medieval name for a bowed string instrument, from which the modern German word Geige (“violin”) derives. Whereas true jigs were quick and wild solo dances of indefinite form, gigues were danced by couples in formal ballet style. The French gigue was a lively dance often in 6/4 or 6/8 time, while the Italian giga was faster and set in 12/8 time. As a musical form the gigue was often used in the stylized dance suite as the last movement. Invariably written in fugal style, the gigues of suites retain the characteristic triple groups of eighth notes. Examples occur in the keyboard suites of J.S. Bach.
