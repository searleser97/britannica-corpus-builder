Divertimento, (Italian: “diversion,” or “amusement”, ) plural Divertimenti,  18th-century musical genre of a light and entertaining nature usually consisting of several movements for strings, winds, or both. The movements included sonata forms, variation forms, dances, and rondos. One of Joseph Haydn’s numerous divertimenti is a sextet written for a double string trio, to be played by two groups simultaneously in different rooms. The divertimenti of W.A. Mozart generally resemble his works entitled cassation and serenade; an exception is the String Divertimento K 563, which ranks among the greatest chamber works of all time.
The divertimento was one of the sources from which the string quartet developed. Its style was to some extent maintained by Beethoven in the Septet, Opus 20, and Schubert in the Octet, Opus 166, both for winds and strings.
