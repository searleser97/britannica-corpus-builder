Polytonality,   in music, the simultaneous occurrence of two or more different tonalities or keys (the interrelated sets of notes and chords used in a composition). If only two keys are employed, the term bitonality is sometimes used.
Polytonality first appeared in music of the early 20th century. Stravinsky’s Petrushka (1911) employs “black keys against white” (in terms of the piano keyboard), combining C major and F♯ major. Sergey Prokofiev’s Sarcasms for piano juxtaposes the keys of F♯ minor in the right hand and B♭ minor in the left, while Darius Milhaud’s Saudades do Brasil combines a melody in C with an accompaniment in A♭ major. Such combinations of tonalities may be reviewed as 20th-century extensions of diatonic harmonic practices, following logically from post-Wagnerian chromaticism.
