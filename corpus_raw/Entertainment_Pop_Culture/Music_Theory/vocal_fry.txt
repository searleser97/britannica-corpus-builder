Vocal fry, also called Murmur, orBreathy Voice,  in phonetics, a speech sound or quality used in some languages, produced by vibrating vocal cords that are less tense than in normal speech, which produces local turbulence in the airstream resulting in a compromise between full voice and whisper. English speakers produce a vocal fry when suggesting ghost wails with an oo-sound. See also voice; whisper.
