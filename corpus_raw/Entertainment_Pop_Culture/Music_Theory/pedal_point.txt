Pedal point,  in music, a tone sustained through several changes of harmony that may be consonant or dissonant with it; in instrumental music it is typically in the bass. The name originates from the technique of prolonging a tone on the pedal keyboard of the organ; hence the occasional use, chiefly in England, of the synonym organ point. The pedal point is to a certain extent a harmonic focus, but only pedal points on the tonic and dominant notes (i.e., on the first and fifth notes of the scale) actually have harmonic value.
The final measures of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Fugue No. 2 in C Minor from The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1 (1722), are an example of a tonic pedal point (on C) with triads on C (tonic), on F (subdominant), and on G (dominant) harmony moving above it. Dominant pedal points are typically used to prepare a sectional cadence (a progression marking the ending of a section); in the sonata form, for instance, the dominant pedal often appears in the passage preceding the return to tonic harmony at the beginning of the recapitulation section. A good example occurs in the first movement of Mozart’s Symphony No. 41 in C Major (1788; Jupiter).
A pedal point may be of long duration, even through an entire piece. Examples include the English composer Henry Purcell’s Fantasia upon One Note for strings (c. 1680), in which middle C is repeated throughout; Franz Schubert’s song “Die liebe Farbe” (1823; from the song cycle Die schöne Müllerin [The Maid of the Mill]), which uses a dominant pedal point; and the 36-measure-long fugal chorus “Der gerechten Seelen,” in Johannes Brahms’s Ein deutsches Requiem (1857–68; German Requiem), which has a tonic pedal point. A 20th-century instance is Maurice Ravel’s “Le Gibet,” from the suite Gaspard de la nuit (1909) for piano.
The term pedal tone, which properly refers to the fundamental note in brass instruments, is sometimes incorrectly used for pedal point.
