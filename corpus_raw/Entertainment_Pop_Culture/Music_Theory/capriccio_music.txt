Capriccio, (Italian: “caprice”)  lively, loosely structured musical composition that is often humorous in character. As early as the 16th century the term was occasionally applied to canzonas, fantasias, and ricercari (often modelled on vocal imitative polyphony). Baroque composers from Girolamo Frescobaldi to J.S. Bach wrote keyboard capriccios displaying strictly fugal as well as whimsical characteristics. Bach’s earliest dated keyboard work is his Capriccio “on the Departure of His Beloved Brother,” which cites among other musical references a coachman’s horn calls.
Pietro Locatelli’s 24 violin capriccios served as models for those of Niccolò Paganini in the 19th century, when the genre enjoyed a certain vogue. Carl Maria von Weber, Felix Mendelssohn, and Johannes Brahms so entitled a number of pieces for piano, whereas Beethoven limited himself to the occasional addition of the adjective capriccioso to such standard tempo modifiers as andante and allegro. Later in the century Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote his Capriccio italien for orchestra and Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov his Capriccio espagnol. More recently, Igor Stravinsky conceived his Piano Concerto (1929) as a capriccio. Capriccio is also the title of Richard Strauss’s last opera (1942), as well as of several late 20th-century works by the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki.
