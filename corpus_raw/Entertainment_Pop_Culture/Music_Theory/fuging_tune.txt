Fuging tune,  a form of hymnody developed by American composers of the so-called First New England school during the period of the American Revolution (1775–83).
A typical fuging tune places the tune in the tenor voice and harmonizes it with block chords. In the next-to-last phrase, called the fuging section or fuge, each of the four voices enters in turn singing the tune or a slightly varied version of it. The last phrase is again chordal. The fuge, although all four parts follow each other in melodic imitation, is not a classical fugue but merely a passage that uses imitative writing.
The term fuging tune is a shortened form of the English phrase “fuging psalm tune,” a type of hymn setting popular in England in the 17th and early 18th centuries. Minor features of style—angular melodic writing, rhythmic simplicity and precision, and diatonic harmony (i.e., little use of notes foreign to the composition’s key)—and the placement of the fuging section in the next-to-last, not the last, line distinguish the American fuging tune from its British parent.
James Lyon’s collection Urania (1762) contains the first fuging psalm tune published in America. The first fuging tunes appeared in William Billings’ Singing Master’s Assistant of 1778. Other American composers such as Daniel Read, Timothy Swan, Jacob French, and Justin Morgan preferred writing this type of piece until around 1800; assertions that the style was crude relative to the works of European composers led to its decline in New England.
But the fuging tune, carried to the west and south in various shape-note hymnals (which use a characteristic musical notation), remained popular outside of New England for at least another 50 years.
