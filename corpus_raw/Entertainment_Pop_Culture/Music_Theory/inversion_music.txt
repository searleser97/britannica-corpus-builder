inversion,  in music, rearrangement of the top-to-bottom elements in an interval, a chord, a melody, or a group of contrapuntal lines of music. The inversion of chords and intervals is utilized for various purposes, e.g., to create a melodic bass line or (with certain chords) to modulate to a new key. To invert a chord or an interval is to rearrange its notes so that the original bottom note becomes an upper note; for example,An interval (such as c′–f′) and its inversion (f′–c″) are complementary: together they form an octave. A three-note chord (triad) can be inverted twice from its original, or root, position.
Inversions of melody and counterpoint enable a composer to elaborate on basic musical material; they are common in fugues. To invert a melody means to change its ascending intervals to descending ones and vice versa; for example:becomes
In inverted counterpoint, the original order of the contrapuntal lines is rearranged. In this way a line sounds above the line that it originally sounded beneath; for example,becomes
