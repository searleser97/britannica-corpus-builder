Just intonation,  in music, system of tuning in which the correct size of all the intervals of the scale is calculated by different additions and subtractions of pure natural thirds and fifths (the intervals that occur between the fourth and fifth, and second and third tones, respectively, of the natural harmonic series; see overtone). Supposedly used in medieval monophonic music (melody only, without harmony) and considerably discussed by theorists, just intonation proved impractical for polyphonic (multipart) music and was replaced at least by the year 1500 by meantone temperament.
