Cantilena,   in late medieval and early Renaissance music, term for certain vocal forms as they were known in the 15th century; also a musical texture used widely in both secular and sacred compositions of that century. Cantilena style is characterized by a predominant vocal top line supported by less complex and usually instrumental tenor and countertenor lines; it occurred both in homophonic, or chordal, music and in polyphonic music having a contrapuntal (interwoven melody) texture.
Cantilena was defined by the Flemish music theorist Johannes Tinctoris (1436–1511) as one of the smaller forms that usually treated love, although any subject was suitable. In England, homophonic carols of the period were called cantilenae if the texts were entirely Latin. Rondeaux and virelais (medieval French poetic forms) as well as ballades were set to music with this texture, as were some masses and motets.
The French composer Guillaume de Machaut (c. 1300–77) and the Burgundian Guillaume Dufay (c. 1400–74) were the most important composers who wrote in this style. It was thus primarily a French idiom in the early 1400s, though it soon surfaced in Italy in works by such composers as Corrado da Pistoia and Ludovico da Rimini.
