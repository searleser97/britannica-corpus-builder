shape-note hymnal, also called patent-note hymnal, or buckwheat-note hymnal,  American hymnal incorporating many folk hymns and utilizing a special musical notation. The seven-note scale was sung not to the syllables do–re–mi–fa–sol–la–ti but to a four-syllable system carried with them by early English colonists: fa–sol–la–fa–sol–la–mi. Differently shaped note heads were used for each of the four syllables: mi (), la, or law (), fa, or faw (), and sol (). The notation of the music was normal except that the note heads of the shape-note system replaced the regular ones. The singer read the music by following the shapes of the note heads, although someone unfamiliar with the system could read the notes according to their placement on the staff.
The hymns normally appear in three-part or, less often, four-part harmonizations. Traditional rules of European harmony are consistently disregarded, giving rise to a spare, vigorous style in which the movement of the individual melodic lines is of primary importance. The melody is normally in the tenor part. Melodies are drawn from folk hymns, religious ballads, revival spirituals (see spiritual), hymns of 18th- and early 19th-century Americans, and, to a lesser extent, popular hymns and anthems of European composers.
The shape-note tradition waned in New England around 1815, pressured by urban trends toward Europeanized music, but it thrived in the Midwest and South. Important hymnals from this period were John Wyeth’s Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second (1813) and Ananias Davisson’s Kentucky Harmony (1816).
Only in the 1880s did the shape-note system decline. Still in use among shape-note singers, who often meet in annual singing conventions, are William Walker’s Southern Harmony (1835; 7th ed. 1854) and Benjamin Franklin White and E.J. King’s Sacred Harp (1844; rev. ed., The Sacred Harp, 1991), both of which use four shapes. Walker’s Christian Harmony (1866) used his own seven-shape system.
