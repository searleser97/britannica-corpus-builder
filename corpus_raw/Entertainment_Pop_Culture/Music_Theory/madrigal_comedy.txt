Madrigal comedy,  Italian musical genre of the late 16th century, a cycle of vocal pieces in the style of the madrigal and lighter Italian secular forms that are connected by a vague plot or common theme. Madrigal comedies were sung in concerts and social gatherings, not staged; in his L’Amfiparnaso (The Slopes of Parnassus, first performed 1594), Orazio Vecchi states that the scenes should reach the mind through the ear rather than the eye. The cycles were light, humorous works, often depicting animated, commonplace scenes, as in Alessandro Striggio’s Il cicalamento delle donne al bucato (The Chattering of the Women at the Laundry, printed 1567).
Madrigal comedies contained caricatures of various national and occupational types, and momentary parodies of well-known madrigals were sometimes performed. L’Amfiparnaso includes some stock characters of the commedia dell’arte. Other composers of madrigal comedies included Giovanni Croce (Triaca musicale, 1595) and Adriano Banchieri (La pazzia senile, 1598, and Il festino nella sera del giovedì grasso avanti cena, 1608; modern English edition, The Animals Improvise Counterpoint, 1937).
