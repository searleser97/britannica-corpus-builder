Drinking song,  song on a convivial theme composed usually for singing in accompaniment to drinking. The form became a standard element in certain types of 19th-century opera and operetta, frequently involving not only a soloist but also a chorus joining in with choral repeats or refrains. In Italy the drinking song is known as brindisi (Italian: “toast”). In Giuseppe Verdi’s operas drinking songs range from the cheerful “Libiamo” (“Let Us Drink”) in La traviata (1853), to Iago’s foreboding toast in Otello (1887).
As a result of the European example of Johann Strauss, Jr., and other composers of light opera and operetta, the drinking song became a staple item in American musical plays to the point where in the 1920s John Philip Sousa testified before the United States Congress against prohibition on the grounds that it adversely affected the American musical theatre because it deprived the drinking song of its traditional social motivation.
