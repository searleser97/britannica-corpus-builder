Tagelied,  (from Middle High German Tageliet, “day song”),  a medieval German dawn song, or song of lament by lovers parting at dawn. The Tagelied is similar to the Provençal alba and may have been derived from it. The most notable composer of Tagelieder was the 13th-century poet Wolfram von Eschenbach.
