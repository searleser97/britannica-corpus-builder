G,  seventh note of the musical alphabet or otherwise the fifth note of the scale of C. It gives its name also to the treble (or violin) clef, the distinguishing sign of which denotes the G line. The sign was originally nothing but a capital G, which in the course of time has come to assume, as the result of various changes of shape, its current conventionalized form.
