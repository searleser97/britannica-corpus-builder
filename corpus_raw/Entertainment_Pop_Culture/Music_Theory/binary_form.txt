Binary form,   in music, the structural pattern of many songs and instrumental pieces, primarily from the 17th to the 19th century, characterized by two complementary, related sections of more or less equal duration that may be represented schematically as ab. In 18th-century compositions, including dance-inspired movements by J.S. Bach and keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, the two sections are separated by double bars with repeat signs, so that a proper performance actually yields an aabb structure.
The first section of a binary composition in a major key typically modulates to the dominant, thus displacing the centre of harmonic gravity to the fifth degree above the tonic: compositions in minor keys similarly modulate to the relative major (i.e., the major key centred on the third degree above the tonic). The second section begins in the new key and, after thriving for a period on the harmonic thus generated, returns to the home key. Binary structures, though not necessarily monothematic, tend to rely on closely linked melodic-rhythmic materials.
In the “rounded” binary form, as exemplified by many of Scarlatti’s sonatas, the second section returns rather quickly to both the original key and the melodic-rhythmic features of substantial portions of the first section. By the same token, binary organization of this sort begins to approximate the ternary outline of a number of later 18th- and 19th-century pieces.
