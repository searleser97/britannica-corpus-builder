Clausula, (Latin: “clause”, ) plural Clausulae,  in music, a 13th-century polyphonic genre featuring two strictly measured parts: notable examples are the descant sections based on the Gregorian chant melisma (several notes to a syllable), which in the organa of the Notre-Dame school alternated with sections featuring coloratura-like passages in relatively free rhythm above a slower-moving cantus firmus.
Clausulae early gained independent status as untexted “substitute” compositions. The first noted composer of such “substitute” clausulae was Pérotin, the successor of Léonin, whose name is forever associated with the two-part organa of the Parisian School. The motet, of only slightly later origin, was in essence a texted clausula. In the clausula the late-medieval, dance-influenced system of rhythmic modes found its first systematic application.
