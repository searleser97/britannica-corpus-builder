Alba, (Provençal:  “dawn”) French aube, or aubade,  in the music of the troubadours, the 11th- and 12th-century poet-musicians of southern France, a song of lament for lovers parting at dawn or of a watchman’s warning to lovers at dawn. A song of the latter type sometimes takes the form of a dialogue between a watchman and a lover. Some sources consider the alba an early form of an aubade, though unlike the alba an aubade is usually a celebration of the dawn. Examples of albas for which music also survives include “Reis glorios” by Giraut de Bornelh (c. 1140–c. 1200) and the anonymous “Gaite de la tor.” The minnesingers, the German counterparts of the troubadours, also used the form, calling it Tagelied (“day song”).
