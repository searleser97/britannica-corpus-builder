Franco Zeffirelli, original name Gianfranco Corsi,  (born February 12, 1923, Florence, Italy—died June 15, 2019, Rome), Italian director, designer, and producer of opera, theatre, motion pictures, and television, particularly noted for the authentic details and grand scale of his opera productions and for his film adaptations of William Shakespeare.
Zeffirelli attended the University of Florence to study architecture, but while there he became involved with the university’s theatre company. His studies were interrupted by Germany’s occupation of Italy; he became a Partisan and served as an interpreter for the Scots Guard. When the war was over, he went to Rome to pursue a career in theatre.
In 1946 he joined Luchino Visconti’s Morelli-Stoppa Company as an actor and stage director. After working with Visconti on La terra trema (1948; The Earth Trembles) and other films, Zeffirelli began to concentrate on stage design. His first major design for opera was a production (1952–53) of Gioachino Rossini’s L’Italiana in Algeri for La Scala, Milan. He worked on a number of other opera and theatre productions—including the operas La traviata, Lucia di Lammermoor, La Bohème, Tosca, Falstaff, and Carmen—from the 1950s through the beginning of the 21st century.
He directed films. Among his major films were three Shakespeare adaptations: a richly produced The Taming of the Shrew (1967), with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor; Romeo and Juliet (1968), in which he for the first time featured teenage actors in the title roles; and Hamlet (1990), with Mel Gibson. His later films included Jane Eyre (1996), Tea with Mussolini (1999), and Callas Forever (2002). He continued to film operas such as I Pagliacci (1981), Cavalleria rusticana (1982), Otello (1986), and La Bohème (2008), often working in myriad roles, including opera director and production and costume designer.
