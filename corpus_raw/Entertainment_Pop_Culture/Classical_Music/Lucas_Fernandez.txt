Lucas Fernández,  (born 1474?, Salamanca, Castile [now in Spain]—died  1542), Spanish dramatist and musician, whose plays are notable for their effective dialogue, simple humour, and skillful use of interpolated songs and music.
Fernández was educated at Salamanca and was professor of music there from 1522 until his death. His six plays show clearly the influence of his rival Juan del Encina. His best work is the Auto de la Pasión, an Easter play. His Diálogo para cantar (1514; “Dialogue for Singing”) is the first example of a rudimentary zarzuela, the distinctively Spanish musical play.
