Giovanni Maria Nanino, Nanino also spelled Nanini,  (born 1543/44, Tivoli, Papal Statesâ€”died  March 11, 1607, Rome [Italy]), Italian singer, teacher, and composer who was one of the better-known figures in late 16th-century European music.
Nanino studied singing and composition and subsequently served as maestro di cappella (choirmaster) at several important Roman churches before becoming a permanent singer in the papal choir in 1577; he served as choirmaster of that body during several years. Nanino was a notable teacher and is thought to have established, along with his brother Giovanni Bernardino Nanino, the first Italian-run public music school in Rome. He taught most of the eminent Roman composers of the first half of the 17th century, including Gregorio Allegri, Felice Anerio, and Antonio Brunelli. Nanino wrote both secular and sacred music, composing several madrigals, a mass, about 20 motets, 5 sets of lamentations, and a number of canzonets, among other works. His madrigals are among the finest of the period, but his sacred music was later eclipsed by that of his eminent contemporary Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina.
