Lauritz Melchior, in full Lauritz Lebrecht Hommel Melchior,  (born March 20, 1890, Copenhagen, Den.—died March 18, 1973, Santa Monica, Calif., U.S.), Danish-U.S. tenor. He debuted as a baritone in 1913 but further study extended his range upward, and he made his tenor debut as Tannhäuser in 1918. Additional training readied him for Bayreuth, where he sang (1924–31), and he remained the preeminent Wagnerian tenor of his time, regularly singing (often opposite Kirsten Flagstad) at Covent Garden (until 1939) and the Metropolitan Opera (1926–50) and making many recordings.
