Carl Friedrich Abel,  (born Dec. 22, 1723, Köthen, duchy of Anhalt-Köthen [Germany]—died  June 20, 1787, London, Eng.), symphonist of the pre-Classical school and one of the last virtuosos of the viola da gamba.
After playing in the Dresden court orchestra (1743–58), Abel went to London in 1759, where he was appointed chamber musician to Queen Charlotte in 1764. When J.C. Bach arrived in London in 1762, they became friends and in 1765 established the “Bach and Abel” concerts that included the first public performances in England of Joseph Haydn’s symphonies. Abel and Bach also befriended the young Mozart when he visited London. Abel composed mainly instrumental music. One of his roughly 45 symphonies and overtures was long attributed (as K 18) to the youthful Mozart, who had copied it out for his own instruction.
