Robert Planquette, in full Jean-Robert Planquette,  (born July 31, 1848, Paris—died  Jan. 28, 1903, Paris), French composer of operettas and other light music. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire, Planquette played and wrote songs for cafés concerts (cafés offering light music). He became famous with the operetta Les Cloches de Corneville (1887; “The Bells of Corneville”; Eng. trans., The Chimes of Normandy), in which he showed his talent for melody. His music contains a touch of pathos and romantic feeling, which, had he cultivated it, would have placed him far above his contemporaries who wrote opéra bouffe; but he had a tendency to repeat the formula on which his reputation was built. Rip Van Winkle (1882), his second most popular work, was first performed in London and subsequently given in Paris as Rip-Rip. The libretto is an adaptation by H.B. Farne of Washington Irving’s tale. Les Voltiguers de la 32e (1880) had a long run in London in 1887 as The Old Guard, and Nell Gwynne (1884) appeared in Paris as La Princesse Colombine. Planquette’s other works include Surcouf (1887; Paul Jones) and Mam’zelle Quat’sous (1897).
