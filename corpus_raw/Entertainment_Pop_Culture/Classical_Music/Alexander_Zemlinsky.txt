Alexander Zemlinsky,  (born Oct. 14, 1871, Vienna, Austria—died  March 15, 1942, Larchmont, N.Y., U.S.), Austrian composer and conductor whose craftsmanship in both areas was and is highly regarded.
Zemlinsky was a student at the Vienna Conservatory from 1887 to 1892. He wrote several chamber pieces in 1893 that attracted the notice of Johannes Brahms, among others. In 1895, while playing in an amateur orchestra, he met Arnold Schoenberg, who became his lifelong friend (and, later, brother-in-law). A number of Zemlinsky’s works were introduced in the late 1890s. He conducted operas at the Vienna Volksoper from 1904 and (except for the 1907–08 season, when he conducted the Hofoper) served as Kapellmeister there from 1906 to 1911. With Schoenberg he founded (1904) an organization to introduce and encourage the appreciation of new music in Vienna. From 1911 to 1927 he was opera conductor for the Deutsches Landestheater in Prague, Czech., and from 1927 to 1930 he was Kapellmeister at the Kroll Opera in Berlin. Until 1933 he taught at the Berlin Musikhochschule. During this time he was a guest conductor with many European orchestras. In 1933 events in Germany compelled him to move to Vienna, and in 1938, after the Anschluss, he left Vienna and immigrated to the United States.
Among his 10 operas, Eine florentinische Tragödie (1915–16) and Der Zwerg (1920–21; also called Der Geburtstag de Infantin), both adapted from works by Oscar Wilde, are probably best known. Lyrische Symphonie (1923) for soprano, baritone, and orchestra is chief among his six symphonies, and Gesänge (“Songs”) to poems by Maurice Maeterlinck (1910–13) the best known of his songs. He also wrote five choral works and several popular instrumental and chamber pieces.
