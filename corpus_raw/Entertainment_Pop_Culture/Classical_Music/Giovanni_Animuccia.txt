Giovanni Animuccia,  (born c. 1500, Florence [Italy]—died  March 20, 1571, Rome, Papal States), Italian composer who contributed to the development of the oratorio.
Little is known of Animuccia’s life until 1555, when he became choirmaster at St. Peter’s Basilica, Rome. His laudi spirituali, religious part-songs sung in Italian, were composed to be performed during St. Philip Neri’s popular services at the Oratory of San Girolamo in Rome. Soloists were sometimes added to the choral performances of the laudi, and the laudi were often presented in dialogue form. This quasi-dramatic structure was the framework within which the oratorio developed.
Animuccia was one of the first composers to simplify the structure of 16th-century church music. Although he was a prolific master of the complex counterpoint of the Netherlandish style that dominated Renaissance music, he experimented with short, clear-cut musical forms, melody set syllabically, and declamation sung in chords. His work possibly influenced Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Animuccia’s works include several books of madrigals, masses, Magnificats, spiritual madrigals, and laudi spirituali.
