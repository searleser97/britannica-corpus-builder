Giuditta Pasta, née Negri,  (born October 28, 1797, Saronno, near Milan—died April 1, 1865, Blevio, Como, Italy), reigning Italian soprano of her time, acclaimed for her vocal range and expressiveness.
She studied with Bonifazio Asioli and Giuseppe Scappa at Milan and made her debut there in 1815 in Scappa’s Le tre Eleonore. She gave a brilliant performance in 1821 at the Théâtre-Italien in Paris as Desdemona in Gioacchino Rossini’s Otello, and in 1824 she conquered London in a series of Rossini roles, including Semiramis in Semiramide.
Pasta’s vocal range and dramatic power were so remarkable that several leading composers wrote operas for her, including Giovanni Pacini, Niobe (1826); Vincenzo Bellini, Ernani, Beatrice di Tenda, Norma, and La sonnambula; and Gaetano Donizetti, Anna Bolena. Even after her voice gave way in the late 1830s, she performed in London and St. Petersburg, until in 1850 she retired to teach at her villa on Lake Como.
