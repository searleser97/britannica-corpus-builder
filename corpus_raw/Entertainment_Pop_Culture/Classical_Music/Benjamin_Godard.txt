Benjamin Godard, in full Benjamin-Louis-Paul Godard,  (born Aug. 18, 1849, Paris, France—died  Jan. 10, 1895, Cannes), French composer of operas, light piano pieces, and songs.
Godard was a child prodigy on the violin, studied composition, and in his youth composed symphonies, chamber works, concerti, and piano music. His best-known opera, Jocelyn (1881), is remembered for its famous “Berceuse.” Other works included the operas Pédro de Zalaméa (1884) and La Vivandière (1895) and his Symphonie Légendaire, Opus 100 (1886). Godard’s music, charming and sentimental, at its best shows an affinity with that of Frédéric Chopin and Robert Schumann.
