Lotte Lehmann,  (born Feb. 27, 1888, Perleberg, Ger.—died  Aug. 26, 1976, Santa Barbara, Calif., U.S.), German-born American lyric-dramatic soprano, particularly renowned for her performances of the songs of Robert Schumann and in the roles of Leonore in Ludwig van Beethoven’s opera Fidelio and of the Marschallin in Richard Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier (The Knight of the Rose).
Lehmann received her early training in Berlin and made her first major operatic appearance in Hamburg as Freia in Richard Wagner’s Das Rheingold in 1910. She went to the Vienna State Opera in 1914 and became closely associated with pre-World War II Viennese culture; there Richard Strauss, who later composed for her the title role in Arabella (1933), chose her for roles in several of his operas. Lehmann also appeared successfully on English stages from 1913 and in the United States from 1930. At the Metropolitan Opera in New York City she sang chiefly Wagnerian roles. From 1938 she lived in the United States, becoming a citizen and continuing an active career as both a leading performer (until her retirement in 1961) and a teacher.
Lehmann was the author of a novel, Orplid, mein Land (1937; Eternal Flight), and three volumes of memoirs. She was not related to the celebrated earlier German soprano Lilli Lehmann.
