André Cardinal Destouches, original name André Cardinal,  (baptized April 6, 1672, Paris, France—died Feb. 7, 1749, Paris), French opera and ballet composer of the period between Jean-Baptiste Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau.
André Cardinal was the son of a wealthy Parisian merchant, Etienne Cardinal, Seigneur des Touches et de Guilleville, but he did not take any form of the patronym until 1694, after which he was known as Destouches. He was educated by the Jesuits and traveled with a priest to Siam (Thailand) in 1687–88. Four years later he participated in the siege of Namur as a musketeer, but he left military service in 1694 to pursue a career in music. Destouches’ first opera, Issé, was produced in 1697. He wrote 10 other major stage works (including some ballets), and in 1713 he was appointed inspector general of the Royal Academy of Music (i.e., the Paris Opéra). In 1728 he became director of that institution, though he abandoned the post two years later. Destouches also wrote two cantatas and several motets.
