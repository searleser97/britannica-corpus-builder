Thurston Dart,  (born Sept. 3, 1921, London, Eng.—died  March 6, 1971, London), English musicologist, harpsichordist, and conductor.
A specialist in early music, Dart studied at the Royal College of Music and University College, Exeter, and later went to Belgium where he worked with Charles van den Borren. He taught at the University of Cambridge from 1947 to 1964, after which he moved to King’s College of the University of London. He also served as editor of the Galpin Society Journal, secretary of the series Musica Britannica, and artistic director of the Philomusica in London.
As a scholar and as a performer, Dart concentrated on the music of J.S. Bach and John Bull and the keyboard and consort music of the 16th to 18th century. He made more than 80 recordings, both as a soloist and in ensembles; they are of particular interest because his research in primary sources produced controversial interpretations of Bach’s orchestral works.
