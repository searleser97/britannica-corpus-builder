Vienna State Opera, German Staatsoper,  theatre in Vienna, Austria, that is one of the world’s leading opera houses, known especially for performances of works by Richard Wagner, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Richard Strauss. The original theatre, located on the Ringstrasse, was built in 1869 to house the expanded operations of the Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper), by which name it was originally known. Particularly famed during the conductorship of Hans Richter (artistic director 1880–96) were productions of Wagner’s cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. The directorship of the composer Gustav Mahler (1897–1907) was one of the artistic high points of the opera’s history. Among directors from 1908 until the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938 were Richard Strauss and the conductors Clemens Krauss and Felix Weingartner.
Wartime bombing destroyed the building in 1945. Its reconstruction, completed in 1955, was financed by taxes, contributions, and U.S. Marshall Plan aid. In the interim, performances of the State Opera were held at the Vienna Volksoper (Folk Opera) and the Theater an der Wien. The outstanding musical director of the period after World War II was the conductor Herbert von Karajan. Performances are financed in part by a state subsidy.
