Andrea Gabrieli, also called Andrea di Cannaregio, Cannareggio, or Canareggio,  (born  1532/33, Venice—died Aug. 30, 1585, Venice), Italian Renaissance composer and organist, known for his madrigals and his large-scale choral and instrumental music for public ceremonies. His finest work was composed for the acoustic resources of the Cathedral of St. Mark in Venice. He was the uncle of Giovanni Gabrieli.
In the late 1550s Gabrieli left Italy for an extended period of foreign travel. He served in the Bavarian court chapel at Munich under another great Franco-Fleming, Orlando di Lasso, then visited the court of Graz in Austria, and finally was patronized by the noble Fugger family in Augsburg. In 1564 he returned to Venice to become second organist at St. Mark’s, where he remained until 1584, when he succeeded the virtuoso performer Claudio Merulo as first organist—a position he held until his death in 1586. Despite his profession, not much of his output in these years was organ music; there were several volumes of madrigals, socially enjoyable settings of Italian poetry to be sung at private houses or cultural academies, where musical life flourished. And there was the large-scale choral and instrumental music for ceremonies of church and state, for which Andrea is best-known today. His motets and masses exploit the tonal variety possible when instruments are added to a choir. Some of these works were published posthumously in 1587: one of the finest is the Magnificat for three choirs and orchestra, doubtless intended to be performed in St. Mark’s.
