Sir Frederic Hymen Cowen,  (born Jan. 29, 1852, Kingston, Jam.—died  Oct. 6, 1935, London, Eng.), conductor, pianist, and composer who was widely regarded as one of the most versatile British musicians of his time.
Cowen exhibited his musical talent at an early age, and as a result his parents took him to England at age four to begin a musical apprenticeship. In 1860 he began studying with Julius Benedict and John Goss, and he later studied with leading musicians at the Leipzig Conservatory and in Berlin. On his return to England in 1868 he established himself as a composer, conductor, and accompanist and was active in British music festivals. His compositions include operas, oratorios, cantatas, orchestral suites, songs, and six symphonies. Cowen’s Symphony No. 3 (1880; Scandinavian), the most successful of his symphonic works, was performed throughout Europe and the United States.
Cowen was active as a conductor in London, Glasgow, and Manchester and as an adjudicator at music festivals throughout the British Isles. He was knighted by King George V in 1911.
