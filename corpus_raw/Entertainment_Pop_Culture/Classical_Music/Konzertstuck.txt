Konzertstück, (German: “concert piece”) also spelled Concertstück, also called concertino,  musical composition for solo instrument and orchestra, usually in one movement, less frequently in several movements played without pause. The genre arose in the early Romantic era (c. 1800) as an offshoot of the concerto. Frequently written in free musical form, it typically includes subsections varied in character and tempo. Examples of the form include the Konzertstück for Piano and Orchestra (1821) and the Concertino for Clarinet and Orchestra, Opus 26, both by Carl Maria von Weber, and Robert Schumann’s Introduction and Allegro Appassionato (Concertstück) for Piano and Orchestra (Opus 92).
