Johann Caspar von Kerll,  (born April 9, 1627, Adorf, Saxony—died  Feb. 13, 1693, Munich), organist and leading master of the middle-Baroque generation of south-German Catholic composers.
In 1645 Kerll was sent by Ferdinand III to study in Rome with the prominent composers Giacomo Carissimi and Girolamo Frescobaldi; earlier he had studied in Vienna. His study in Italy had great influence on his composition, much of which is Italianate in style. From 1656 to 1673 Kerll was the court opera conductor in Munich, where several of his operas were produced. By 1675 he was in Vienna, and in 1677 he became organist of the imperial court. In 1684 he returned to Munich.
Kerll introduced operatic dramatic devices into his church music. He wrote masses, requiems and Magnificats, often in polychoral style (e.g., for two or three choruses), and made use of instrumental accompaniments in which instruments were pitted against voices for deliberate dramatic contrast—the so-called concertato style, which Kerll played an important role in establishing in Germany. His sacred play Pia et Fortis Mulier (1677; “Pious and Strong Woman”) was likewise composed throughout in operatic fashion.
Kerll was influential as a teacher, and his music was copied and studied by later composers, including Bach and Handel.
