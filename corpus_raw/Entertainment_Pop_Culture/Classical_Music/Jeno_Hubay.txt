Jenö Hubay,  (born Sept. 15, 1858, Budapest—died  March 12, 1937, Budapest), Hungarian violinist, teacher, and composer, noted especially for his teaching.
He studied as a child with his father, a professor of violin at the Budapest Conservatory, and gave his first concert at the age of 11. After studying with Joseph Joachim in Berlin from 1871 to 1876 he went to Paris, where he impressed Henry Vieuxtemps, who later became a close friend. He succeeded Vieuxtemps as professor at the Brussels Conservatory in 1882, but returned to Budapest to take up his father’s old position in 1886. He was director of the Conservatory from 1919 to 1934. Among his students were Franz von Vecsey, Joseph Szigeti, Emil Telmányi, and Eddy Brown. He performed in most European countries; his playing had a rich, romantic quality. His numerous works include operas (some in Hungarian) and orchestral works as well as concertos and other works for the violin.
