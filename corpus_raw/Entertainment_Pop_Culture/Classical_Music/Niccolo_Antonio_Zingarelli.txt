Niccolò Antonio Zingarelli, Niccolò also spelled Nicola,  (born April 4, 1752, Naples [Italy]—died  May 5, 1837, Torre del Greco, near Naples), one of the principal Italian composers of operas and religious music of his time.
Zingarelli studied at the conservatory at Loreto and earned his living in his youth as a violinist. His first opera, Montezuma, was successfully produced at the San Carlo Theatre in Naples in 1781. Alsinda, given at La Scala, Milan, in 1785, was the first of a series of his operas produced there until 1803.
In 1789 Zingarelli was invited to Paris to compose Antigone to a libretto by Jean-François Marmontel for the Opéra. The French Revolution drove him to Switzerland, and from there he returned to Milan, where in 1793 he was appointed music director of the cathedral. His later works for La Scala included the comic opera Il mercato di Monfregoso (1792), based on a play by Carlo Goldoni, which became popular in the German states, and Giulietta e Romeo (1796), after William Shakespeare, held to be his finest work. From 1794 to 1804 he was music director at Loreto, where he composed a large number of sacred works (still in manuscript) and continued to write operas for production in Milan and other Italian cities. In 1804 he was music director at the Sistine Chapel in Rome, where he composed cantatas on poems by Torquato Tasso and Dante. He also wrote two operas for production in Rome; the second of these, Berenice (1811), achieved great popularity. This was the last of his 37 operas.
In 1811, for patriotic reasons, Zingarelli refused to conduct a Te Deum in honor of Napoleon’s son, the “King of Rome.” He was arrested and taken to Paris, where the emperor, an admirer of his music, released him with a pension. In 1813 he was appointed director of the Naples Conservatory and in 1816 succeeded Giovanni Paisiello as music director of the cathedral in that city. Among his pupils were Michele (later Sir Michael) Costa, Vincenzo Bellini, and Saverio Mercadante.
