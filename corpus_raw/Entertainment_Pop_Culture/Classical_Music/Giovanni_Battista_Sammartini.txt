Giovanni Battista Sammartini,  Sammartini also spelled San Martini, byname Il Milanese,  (born 1700/01, Milan [Italy]—died  Jan. 15, 1775, Milan), Italian composer who was an important formative influence on the pre-Classical symphony and thus on the Classical style later developed by Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
The son of Alexis Saint-Martin, a French oboist, he spent most of his life in Milan, was organist at several churches there, and was said by Charles Burney to have been organist at the convent of Santa Maria Maddalena from 1730 to 1770. He became known first as a composer of sacred music. He was one of the first to compose symphonies for concert performance; their ancestry was in the Italian opera overtures. As his orchestral and chamber music became known outside Italy, it attracted pupils to Milan, among them Christoph Gluck, who probably studied with him in 1737–41.
Sammartini was a prolific composer; by some estimates, he produced 2,000 works. It is impossible, however, to decide whether certain works were composed by him or by his brother Giuseppe, or even by Giovanni Battista Martini (1706–84) or one of the numerous forgers who profited from the popularity of his genuine works. Sammartini’s brother, Giuseppe Sammartini (1695–1750), was renowned as the finest oboist of his time and was also a prominent composer in England, where he spent his later years.
