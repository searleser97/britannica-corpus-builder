Joseph Bodin de Boismortier,  (born Dec. 23, 1689, Thionville, Franceâ€”died  Oct. 28, 1755, Roissy-en-Brie), prolific French composer of instrumental and vocal music. He spent his late childhood and early adult years in Metz and Perpignan, France, then moved to Paris about 1723. In 1724 he secured a royal privilege as engraver and began publishing his music; by 1747 he had published more than 100 works in a variety of vocal and instrumental combinations.
His music was extremely popular, and he became rich without the aid of patrons. He wrote for amateur musicians and the instruments they played, as well as for voice. Boismortier wrote the first French solo concerto for any instrument, a concerto for cello, viol, or bassoon (1729). His many works for the transverse flute greatly expanded the repertoire of the instrument; he also wrote a flute instruction method (now lost).
