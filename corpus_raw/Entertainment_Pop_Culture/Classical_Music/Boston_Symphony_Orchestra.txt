Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO),  American symphony orchestra based in Boston, founded in 1881 by Henry Lee Higginson. The orchestra achieved renown for its interpretations of the French repertoire under such conductors as Pierre Monteux and Charles Munch and for its championing of contemporary music. The BSO has made recordings since 1917, performs frequently over radio, gives up to 250 concerts annually, and makes national and world tours.
Its music directors have been George Henschel (1881–84), Wilhelm Gericke (1884–89; 1898–1906), Arthur Nikisch (1889–93), Emil Paur (1893–98), Karl Muck (1906–08; 1912–18), Max Fiedler (1908–12), Henri Rabaud (1918–19), Pierre Monteux (1919–24), Serge Koussevitzky (1924–49), Charles Munch (1949–62), Erich Leinsdorf (1962–69), William Steinberg (1969–72), Seiji Ozawa (music advisor 1972–73; director 1973–2002), James Levine (2004–11), and Andris Nelsons (2014–). Principal guest conductors included Michael Tilson Thomas (1972–74) and Colin Davis (1972–84). In 1964 Leinsdorf founded the Boston Symphony Chamber Players.
In 1936, under Koussevitzky, the BSO played its first summer concerts at Tanglewood, in the Berkshire mountains of Massachusetts. Founded in 1940 as the Berkshire Music Center, the Tanglewood Music Center became the summer home of the BSO and an institute for advanced training for musicians.
In 1885, under Adolf Neuendorff, musicians of the BSO gave their first “Promenade” concert of lighter classical and popular music in a café setting. From 1900 the ensemble was called the Boston Pops Orchestra. Arthur Fiedler (1930–79) was its longtime conductor. Its 19th conductor, John Williams (1980–93; from 1994, conductor laureate), became artist-in-residence at the Tanglewood Music Center. In 1995 Keith Lockhart became conductor.
