Faustina Bordoni,  married name Hasse,  (born c. 1700, Venice [Italy]—died Nov. 4, 1781, Venice), Italian mezzo-soprano, one of the first great prima donnas, known for her beauty and acting as well as her vocal range and breath control.
Of a noble family, she studied with Michelangelo Gasparini under the patronage of Alessandro and Benedetto Marcello. In 1716 she made a sensational debut in Venice in Carlo Francesco Pollarolo’s Ariodante. By 1722 her fame in Italy was such that a medal was created in Naples to honour her. In 1723 she made her first appearance in Munich in Pietro Torri’s Griselda. After hearing her in the Vienna Court Opera in 1724, George Frideric Handel engaged her, and in 1726 she appeared in his Alessandro, performed by his opera company in London. There she and Francesca Cuzzoni, a leading soprano, became rivals, and devotees of both singers exacerbated their bitter relationship, which erupted in 1727 in a scandalous hair-pulling battle during a performance of Giovanni Bononcini’s Astianatte. The two divas were subsequently satirized as Polly and Lucy in John Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera and its sequel, Polly. Bordoni created other Handel roles: Alcestis in Admeto and Pulcheria in Riccardo Primo in 1727 and Emira in Siroe and Elisa in Tolemeo in 1728. Bordoni married the composer Johann Adolf Hasse, and they moved to Dresden, where she performed in at least 15 of his operas. During long visits to Italy she performed in more than 30 operas in Venice. In 1750 she sang at court in Paris. She was still active in her 70s, when she retired to Venice.
