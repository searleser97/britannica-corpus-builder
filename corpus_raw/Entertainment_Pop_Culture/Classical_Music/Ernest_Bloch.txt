Ernest Bloch,  (born July 24, 1880, Geneva, Switzerland—died July 15, 1959, Portland, Oregon, U.S.), composer whose music reflects Jewish cultural and liturgical themes as well as European post-Romantic traditions. His students included Roger Sessions and Randall Thompson.
Bloch studied with noted Swiss composer Émile Jaques-Dalcroze and in Belgium with violinist Eugène Ysaÿe. From 1911 to 1915 he taught at the Geneva Conservatory. He toured the United States in 1916 with the English dancer Maud Allen, and after the tour company went bankrupt he settled in New York. In 1920 he became the first director of the Cleveland Institute of Music, a position he held until 1925. Bloch became a U.S. citizen in 1924. He directed the San Francisco Conservatory of Music from 1925 to 1930. In 1930 he went to Switzerland, but he returned to the United States in December 1938. In June 1939 he received an offer to teach at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1941 he bought a house in Agate Beach, Oregon, near that of his married son, where he produced one-third of his compositional output when he was not teaching or traveling. His association with Berkeley lasted until his retirement in 1952.
Bloch’s music reflects many post-Romantic influences, among them the styles of Claude Debussy, Gustav Mahler, and Richard Strauss. His interest in the chromatic sonorities of Debussy and Maurice Ravel is evident in the tone poem Hiver-Printemps (1905; Winter-Spring). Bloch composed a significant group of works on Jewish themes, among them the Israel Symphony (1916), Trois poèmes juifs for orchestra (1913; Three Jewish Poems), the tone poem Schelomo for cello and orchestra (1916; Solomon), and the suite Baal Shem for violin and piano (1923). His sacred service Avodath Hakodesh for baritone, chorus, and orchestra (1930–33) represents the full maturity of his use of music appropriate to Jewish themes and liturgy. Many of Bloch’s works show a strong neoclassical trend, combining musical forms of the past with 20th-century techniques. Examples include his Concerto Grosso No. 1 (1925) and his Quintet for piano and strings (1923), which utilizes quarter tones to colour and heighten the emotional intensity of the music. His other notable works include an “epic rhapsody” for orchestra (America, 1926), the Suite for viola and piano (1919), and five string quartets (1916, 1945, 1952, 1953, 1956).
