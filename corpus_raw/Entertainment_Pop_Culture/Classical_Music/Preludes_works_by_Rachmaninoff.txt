Preludes,  a group of 24 preludes for piano by Russian composer and pianist Sergey Rachmaninoff. They were intended as virtuoso piano showpieces and were published over the course of nearly 20 years, mostly during the first decade of the 20th century. The most familiar of the preludes—and the best-known of all Rachmaninoff’s works for solo piano—is the first in the sequence, the Prelude in C-sharp Minor, Op. 3, No. 2.
By the mid-1800s the prelude—once understood to be an introductory piece to a longer work—had evolved into a short freestanding piece, one still intended for solo keyboard. Johann Sebastian Bach had established a practice of writing a quantity of pieces each in a different key so as to explore the aural potentials of the different keys. Frédéric Chopin had continued it after Bach’s death, and thereafter Rachmaninoff took the challenge.
Unlike the others, however, Rachmaninoff did not publish his preludes in a single ordered set. He wrote the first prelude in 1892 at age 19 as part of his Opus 3, Morceaux de fantaisie (“Fantasy Pieces”). The other works in that set were of a different character and bore other titles. By 1903 Rachmaninoff had completed another 10 preludes, published as Opus 23, and in 1910 another 13, published as Opus 32. In the years between the composition of the first and last preludes, Rachmaninoff had become an international star as composer, pianist, and conductor. To his dismay, the piece that audiences demanded most often was the earliest of his preludes. He began to refuse to play the piece, having tired of it.
