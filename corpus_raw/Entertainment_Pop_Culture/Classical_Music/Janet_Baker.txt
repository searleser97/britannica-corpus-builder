Janet Baker, in full Dame Janet Abbott Baker,  (born August 21, 1933, Hatfield, Yorkshire, England), English operatic mezzo-soprano who was known for her vocal expression, stage presence, and effective diction. As a recitalist she was noted for her interpretations of the works of Gustav Mahler, Edward Elgar, and Johann Sebastian Bach.
Baker studied voice in London until 1956, when she won second prize in the Kathleen Ferrier Award, which paid for her studies at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria. She made her operatic debut in 1956 at the Oxford University Opera Club as Roza in Bedřich Smetana’s The Secret and also sang Eduige in Rodelinda, the first of many memorable performances of the operatic roles of George Frideric Handel and other Baroque composers at the Barber Institute in Birmingham.
In 1962 Baker sang the female lead in Henry Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas and was Polly in Benjamin Britten’s The Beggar’s Opera the following year. In 1971 she created the role of Kate Julian, written especially for her, in Britten’s Owen Wingrave, first for television and then for the stage. She also won the Hamburg Shakespeare Prize that year. She performed successfully in the Raymond Leppard revivals of early Italian operas, notably as Penelope in Claudio Monteverdi’s Il Ritorno d’Ulisse in patria in 1972. She sang the 1975 premiere performance of Dominick Argento’s song cycle From the Diary of Virginia Woolf, which won the Pulitzer Prize. Baker retired in 1982. That year Full Circle: An Autobiographical Journal, an account of her last year onstage, was published.
Baker later served as chancellor of the University of York (1991–2004). She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1976 and a Companion of Honour in 1994.
