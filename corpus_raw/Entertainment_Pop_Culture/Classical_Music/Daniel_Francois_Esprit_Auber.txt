Daniel-François-Esprit Auber,  (born January 29, 1782, Caen, France—died May 12, 1871, Paris), French composer who was prominent in the 19th-century cultivation of opera containing spoken as well as sung passages (comic opera). The great contemporary success of his works was due in part to the expertly tailored librettos of Eugène Scribe and in part to Auber’s spirited musical settings, which were influenced by Gioachino Rossini and well suited to French taste. One of the most successful and still familiar works in this popular, romantic vein is Fra Diavolo (1830; Brother Devil).
The collaboration between Auber and Scribe produced 38 stage works between 1823 and 1864. The spectacular Muette de Portici (1828; Mute Girl of Portici, also known as Masaniello) has been regarded as an archetype of French grand opera. It greatly impressed Richard Wagner, who modeled his Rienzi (1840) after it. In addition to anticipating the works of Giacomo Meyerbeer, Auber’s Le Philtre (1831) provided the dramatic basis for Gaetano Donizetti’s Elisir d’amore (1832; The Elixir of Love), and Auber’s Gustave III (1833) gave Giuseppe Verdi his story for Un ballo in maschera (1859; A Masked Ball).
Having composed music since childhood, Auber became a pupil of Luigi Cherubini in 1805. His life, almost entirely devoted to opera, was uneventful. His religious cantatas and motets, written between 1852 and 1855, are little known. Auber was elected to the Académie Française in 1829, was appointed director of the Paris Conservatory in 1842, and became chapelmaster to Napoleon III in 1857. His music is also thought to have influenced Charles Gounod, Jules Massenet, and Richard Strauss.
