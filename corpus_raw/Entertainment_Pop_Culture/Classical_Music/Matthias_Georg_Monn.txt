Matthias Georg Monn, also called Georg Matthias Monn, original name Johann Georg Monn, Monn also spelled Mann,  (born April 9, 1717, Vienna, Austria—died  Oct. 3, 1750, Vienna), Austrian composer and organist whose compositions mark a transition from the Baroque to the Classical period in music. Monn changed his original name to avoid confusion with his younger brother Johann Christoph Monn (1726–82), who was a pianist and composer.
Little is known about Matthias Monn’s early life, but he was a choirboy at the monastery of Klostenburg at the age of 14 or 15, and by 1738 he was organist of Vienna’s new St. Charles Church. Although highly respected in Vienna, Monn never became widely known in the rest of Europe, and none of his compositions, which included 21 symphonies and a missa solemnis, was performed during his lifetime. One of his symphonies, completed in 1740, is the first known to be composed in four movements using a minuet as the third movement. All the others were in the then-conventional three movements. Monn’s clear development sections and complete recapitulations brought to symphonic composition a form previously used only in the sonata.
