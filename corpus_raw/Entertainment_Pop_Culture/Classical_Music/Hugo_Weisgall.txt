Hugo Weisgall, in full Hugo David Weisgall,  (born Oct. 13, 1912, Eibenschutz, Moravia [now Ivančice, Czech Republic]—died March 11, 1997, Manhasset, N.Y., U.S.), Czech-born American composer and educator, whose operas have been praised for their literary quality, their psychological drama, and their unique vocal style.
Born into a musical family that had produced several generations of composers and cantors, Weisgall immigrated with his parents to Baltimore, Md., U.S., in 1920. He studied at the Peabody Conservatory (1927–32) in Baltimore and later attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he earned diplomas in conducting (1938), under Fritz Reiner, and in composition (1939), under the violinist and composer Rosario Scalero. From the early 1930s to the early 1940s, Weisgall also studied composition periodically with Roger Sessions. Meanwhile, he earned a doctorate in German literature from Johns Hopkins University (1940) in Baltimore.
Following service in the U.S. Army (1941–48), Weisgall embarked on a career in teaching, holding positions at Johns Hopkins and at the Juilliard School in New York City, among others. Although he had begun to write operas in the 1930s, it was the 1952 premiere of his two one-act works, The Tenor (1950) and The Stronger (1952), that solidified his reputation as a master of the genre. In 1956 Weisgall completed his first full-length opera, Six Characters in Search of an Author, an adaptation of Luigi Pirandello’s play by that name. His next opera, Purgatory (1958), based on a poem by William Butler Yeats, marked his first attempt at 12-tone composition, an atonal musical style that characterized much of his later work. Altogether, Weisgall wrote 10 operas, as well as song cycles, ballets, and various pieces of chamber music; his last completed opera, Esther (1993), was widely acclaimed. By the time of his sudden death following a fall in 1997, Weisgall had won numerous prestigious awards—including three Guggenheim fellowships—for his musical activities and accomplishments.
