Neville Marriner, in full Sir Neville Marriner,  (born April 15, 1924, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England—died October 2, 2016, London), British violinist, teacher, and conductor who had one of the most prolific recording relationships in classical music history with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, a London chamber ensemble that he founded (1958) and for which he served as the music director (1958–2011; life president from 2011 until his death).
Marriner graduated from the Royal College of Music in London in 1946 and went on to study with René Benedetti at the Paris Conservatory. He then taught violin at the Royal College of Music from 1949 to 1959. During his early career as a violinist, he played with a number of small ensembles, including the Jacobean Ensemble, where he performed with the early-music specialist Thurston Dart. Marriner also played in the London Philharmonia (1952–56) and the London Symphony Orchestra (1956–68).
Encouraged by Pierre Monteux, Marriner began to conduct, specializing in Baroque music. In addition to organizing, building, and recording extensively with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, he also directed and conducted major symphony orchestras throughout the world, including the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra (1969–78), the Minnesota Symphony (1979–86), and the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra in Germany (1986–89). He also served as guest conductor for a number of ensembles, including the Dresden Staatskapelle and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra. In the late 1970s Marriner expanded his repertoire to include opera, in particular the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Gioachino Rossini. Into his 80s he continued to travel with the Academy and to conduct major orchestras around the world. In 2011 he was appointed honorary conductor of the I, Culture Orchestra, an ensemble that brought together young musicians from across the eastern European region both to promote cross-cultural understanding and to celebrate the first time Poland would preside over the Council of the European Union.
Marriner won three Grammy Awards (1981, 1984, and 2002), including one for the sound track to Amadeus (1984), a film for which he was music supervisor. In 1979 he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), in 1985 he was made a knight bachelor, and in 2015 he was named a Companion of Honour.
