Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO),  American symphony orchestra based in Chicago, Ill., renowned for its distinctive tone and its recordings under such conductors as Fritz Reiner and Sir Georg Solti. It was founded by Theodore Thomas in 1891 as the Chicago Orchestra and operated as the Theodore Thomas Orchestra from 1905 to 1913, when it was named the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
Its music directors have been Fredrick Stock (1905–42), Désiré Defauw (1943–47), Artur Rodzinski (1947–48), Rafael Kubelík (1950–53), Fritz Reiner (1953–62; musical adviser, 1961–63), Jean Martinon (1963–68), Irwin Hoffman (acting music director; 1968–69), Sir Georg Solti (1969–91; music director laureate, 1991–97), and Daniel Barenboim (1991–2006). From 2006 Bernard Haitink served as principal conductor until Riccardo Muti took the podium as musical director in 2010. Principal guest conductors have included Carlo Maria Giulini (1969–72), Claudio Abbado (1982–85), and Pierre Boulez (1995–2006; conductor emeritus from 2006).
The CSO is known for its emphasis on the central European repertoire. Reiner was credited with building the orchestra into a precise, world-class ensemble. Under Solti and Giulini, the CSO made a triumphant European tour in 1971. The orchestra made frequent subsequent European tours and tours of Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. During summers, the CSO is the principal orchestra at the Ravinia Festival in suburban Highland Park, Ill.
In 1957, at Reiner’s request, Margaret Hillis created and became director of the Chicago Symphony Chorus, the first such ensemble in the United States to be permanently affiliated with a major symphony orchestra. Duain Wolfe succeeded Hillis as director in 1994. CSO composers in residence have included John Corigliano (1987–91) and Shulamit Ran (1990–97), among others. In 2010 cellist Yo-Yo Ma became the orchestra’s first creative consultant.
The CSO has premiered works by Franz Liszt, Aleksandr Glazunov, Ernest Bloch, Zoltán Kodály, Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud, Roy Harris, Samuel Barber, Ned Rorem, Gunther Schuller, Hans Werner Henze, Witold Lutosławski, and Easley Blackwood.
