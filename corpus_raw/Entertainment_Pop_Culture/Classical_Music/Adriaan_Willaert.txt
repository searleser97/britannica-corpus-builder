Adriaan Willaert,  (born c. 1490, Bruges, Flanders?—died  Dec. 8, 1562, Venice), Flemish composer who contributed significantly to the development of the Italian madrigal, and who established Venice as one of the most influential musical centres of the 16th century.
Willaert studied law at the University of Paris but abandoned this in favour of music, studying with the composer Jean Mouton. In 1527 he became music director of St. Mark’s, Venice, where he created a school that attracted musicians from all over Europe. His students included de Rore, Zarlino, and Andrea Gabrieli.
Willaert’s madrigals show a gradual synthesis of the contrapuntal style of the Franco-Netherlandish school and the growing Italian emphasis on harmonic colour and expressiveness. His chansons reflect a similar development. As a composer of sacred music he is known primarily for his motets. Probably inspired by the two opposing choir lofts at St. Mark’s, he developed a style of polyphony in which two four-part choirs sing alternately, but occasionally combine in an eight-part section. This led directly to the polychoral writing that characterized Venetian music in the second half of the 16th century. Willaert was also one of the earliest composers to write purely instrumental works: canzoni, ricercari, and fantasies for organ and for instrumental ensembles.
