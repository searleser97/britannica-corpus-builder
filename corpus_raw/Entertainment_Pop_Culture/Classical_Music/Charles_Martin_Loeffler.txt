Charles Martin Loeffler, in full Charles Martin Tornow Loeffler,  (born Jan. 30, 1861, Mulhouse, France—died  May 19, 1935, Medfield, Mass., U.S.), American composer whose works are distinguished by a poetic lyricism in an Impressionist style.
As a youth, Loeffler studied violin and music theory in Berlin and Paris. He went to the United States in 1881 and joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra as a violinist the following year. Although he resigned in 1903 to devote himself to composition, he maintained his relationship with the Boston Symphony, and almost all of his symphonic works were first performed by that orchestra. His most enduring work, A Pagan Poem for piano and orchestra (1906; after an eclogue of Virgil), uses extended harmonies to evoke pagan antiquity. Among other works are the Fantastic Concerto for cello and orchestra (1893), La Mort de Tintagiles (1897; after Maurice Maeterlinck), Music for Four Stringed Instruments (1917), the symphonic poem Memories of My Childhood (1924; subtitled Life in a Russian Village), Canticum Fratris Solis for voice and chamber orchestra (1925), and Evocation for women’s voices and orchestra (1930), as well as a number of songs, piano pieces, and other chamber music.
