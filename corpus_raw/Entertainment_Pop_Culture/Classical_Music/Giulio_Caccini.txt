Giulio Caccini, also called Giulio Romano,  (born c. 1550, Rome, Papal States [now in Italy]—buried December 10, 1618, Florence), singer and composer whose songs greatly helped to establish and disseminate the new monodic music introduced in Italy about 1600. This is music in which an expressive melody is accompanied by evocative chords, as opposed to the traditional polyphonic style with its complex interweaving of several melodic lines.
Caccini apparently studied with Giovanni Animuccia in Rome before going to Florence with his patron Cosimo I de’ Medici sometime before 1574. During the last 20 years of the 16th century, he was closely associated with the Camerata of Count Giovanni Bardi, the Florentine group that produced the earliest operas. While playing and singing in court masques (for some of which he composed music), he perfected the new conception of song that he revealed in Le nuove musiche (1602; “The New Music”). This work consists mainly of solo madrigals and arias and contains an important explanatory preface. The madrigals show his new manner most clearly: an elegant and pliable vocal line, scrupulously following the inflections of the words and heightened by affective embellishments, stands out against a subdued chordal accompaniment in diatonic harmony improvised from the newly invented basso continuo. During the next 30 years many other Italian composers took up the fashion for monodies, and Caccini himself produced two more collections. He also wrote an opera in 1600 (performed Florence, 1602) based on the same libretto as Jacopo Peri’s Euridice.
