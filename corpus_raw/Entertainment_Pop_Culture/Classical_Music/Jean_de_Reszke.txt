Jean de Reszke, also spelled Jan Retzské, original name Jan Mieczyslaw,  (born Jan. 14, 1850, Warsaw, Pol., Russian Empire [now in Poland]—died  April 3, 1925, Nice, Fr.), Polish operatic tenor, celebrated for his beautiful voice, phrasing, and enunciation as well as his charm and striking presence.
Of a musical family, de Reszke was first taught by his mother, then by vocal coaches in Warsaw and Paris. After an undistinguished early career as a baritone under the name Giovanni di Reschi in Italy, London, and Paris, he retrained as a tenor with Giovanni Sbriglia and in 1879 made an inauspicious debut in Madrid in Giacomo Meyerbeer’s Robert le diable.
For the next few years de Reszke concentrated on concert performances, until persuaded to create John the Baptist in the Paris premiere of Jules Massenet’s Hérodiade at the Paris Opéra in 1884. De Reszke’s performance was a triumph, and for the next five years he was the leading tenor of the Paris Opéra, where in 1885 he created Rodrique in Le Cid, written for him by Massenet. He first sang Wagnerian roles in London, as Lohengrin in 1887 and as Walther in Die Meistersinger in 1888. In 1891 he made his American debut in Chicago and was engaged by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, where he remained until 1901, winning great acclaim in Wagnerian roles, above all as Tristan. In 1902 he withdrew to Paris and teaching, and in 1919 he settled in Nice. He often performed with his brother Edouard and his sister Josephine, both eminent singers.
