Manuel Mujica Láinez,  (born September 11, 1910, Buenos Aires, Argentina—died April 21, 1984, Córdoba province), popular Argentine writer whose novels and short stories are best known for their masterful and fascinating blend of myth and fantasy with historical figures and events.
Mujica Láinez was descended from an Argentine family that included the writers Juan Cruz Varela and Miguel Cané. He was educated in Buenos Aires, France, and England. At age 22 he returned to Buenos Aires and became a correspondent for La Nación, a newspaper with which he was associated as an art critic and correspondent for the remainder of his life.
Mujica Láinez’s first novel, Don Galaz de Buenos Aires (1938), was a re-creation of city life in the 17th century. Canto a Buenos Aires (1943), his first literary success, is a poetic chronicle of the foundation and development of the Argentine capital. He solidified his reputation in Argentina with a series of novels known as his Buenos Aires cycle; Los idolos (1953; “The Idols”), La casa (1954; “The House”), Los viajeros (1955; “The Travelers”), and Invitados en El Paraíso (1957; “Guests at The Paradise”) are an account of the decadence and dissolution of the wealthy class in Buenos Aires. Aquí vivieron (1949; “They Lived Here”) and Misteriosa Buenos Aires (1950) are collections of short stories that develop some of the themes of his previous works.
Mujica Láinez’s masterpiece is the novel Bomarzo (1962; Eng. trans. Bomarzo), a painstaking re-creation of the life and times of Pier Francesco Orsini, one of the most powerful men of the Italian Renaissance. Mujica Láinez also wrote the libretto and program notes for the opera Bomarzo by Alberto Ginastera, which had its premiere in Washington, D.C., in 1967.
Rooted in Latin American literary tradition, Mujica Láinez’s novels are characterized by social satire and an ironic perspective on history. In addition to fiction, Mujica Láinez wrote biographies and critical studies of many Latin American artists and poets. His later works include Cecil (1972), El viaje de los siete demonios (1974; “The Journey of the Seven Demons”), El laberinto (1974; “The Labyrinth”), Sergio (1976), and El gran teatro (1979; “The Great Theatre”).
