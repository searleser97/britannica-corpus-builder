Rafael Kubelík, in full Jeronym Rafael Kubelík,  (born June 29, 1914, Býchory, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now in Czech Republic]—died  Aug. 11, 1996, Lucerne, Switz.), Bohemian-born Swiss conductor, musical director, and composer, who was noted for his frequent guest appearances with major orchestras throughout the world.
He was a son of the violinist Jan Kubelík and studied composition and conducting at the Prague Conservatory. He conducted the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra from 1936 to 1939 and from 1942 to 1948. He left Czechoslovakia in 1948 after the Communist takeover, settling first in England and later in Switzerland, where he became a citizen in 1973. He became principal conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1950 but was forced to resign in 1953 amid controversy over his plans for staff changes and a concert program emphasizing modern compositions. As music director of the Covent Garden Opera from 1955 to 1958, he championed opera in English. From 1961 to 1979 he was principal conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. From 1973 to 1974 he was also musical director of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Kubelík’s own compositions include two operas, three symphonies, choral works, and concertos.
