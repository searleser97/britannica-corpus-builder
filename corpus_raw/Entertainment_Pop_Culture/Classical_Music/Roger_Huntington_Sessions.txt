Roger Sessions,   (born Dec. 28, 1896, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.—died  March 16, 1985, Princeton, N.J.), American composer of symphonic and instrumental music who played a leading part in educating his contemporaries to an appreciation of modern music.
He studied at Harvard University and at the Yale School of Music and later took composition lessons from Ernest Bloch. After several years in Europe he returned to the United States in 1933. Between 1928 and 1931, however, in association with Aaron Copland, he had presented an important series of concerts of modern music, the Copland–Sessions Concerts in New York City. He taught composition at Princeton University (1935–45), at the University of California, Berkeley (1945–52), and again at Princeton from 1953. In 1965 he was appointed to the staff of the Juilliard School of Music, New York City.
His first important work, an orchestral suite from the incidental music for Leonid Andreyev’s play The Black Maskers (1923), is marked by rhapsodic eloquence and even flamboyance and has remained his most popular score. His eight symphonies (1927, 1946, 1957, 1958, 1964, 1966, 1967, and 1968) are severe in idiom, using a polyphonic technique and asymmetrical rhythms. Similar qualities mark his two string quartets (1936 and 1951), string quintet (1958), three piano sonatas (1930, 1946, and 1965), and chorale preludes for organ (1925). Sessions considers his Violin Concerto (1935) to be one of the earliest of his mature works. His one-act opera The Trial of Lucullus (1947) and his Idyll of Theocritus (1954) for soprano and orchestra have affinities with the central European Expressionist style. His opera Montezuma (1947) was produced in West Berlin in 1964. Later works are the cantata When Lilacs Last in the Door-yard Bloom’d (1970) and Rhapsody (1970) for orchestra. He also composed the Concertino for Chamber Orchestra (1972) and Three Biblical Choruses (1971; premiered 1975), which includes text from the book of Psalms and Isaiah. A retrospective of Sessions’ work was given in the Continuum Concerts in New York City in 1981. His critical works deal with the artistic and sociocultural concerns of musical life and include The Intent of the Artist (1941), The Musical Experience of Composer, Performer, Listener (1950), Harmonic Practice (1951), Questions About Music (1970), and Roger Sessions on Music (1979). Sessions was named to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1938 and to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1953. In 1974 he received a Pulitzer Special Citation for Music; in 1982 he received a second Pulitzer Prize for the final work of his career, Concerto for Orchestra (1981).
