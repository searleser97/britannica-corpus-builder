Eve Queler, née Eve Rabin,  (born January 11, 1931, New York, New York, U.S.), American conductor who was one of the first women to establish herself in the traditionally male-dominated field of orchestral conducting.
Queler early displayed remarkable musical ability. She began formal piano lessons at five and in 1954 graduated from the High School of Music and Art in New York City. In 1956 she entered Mannes College, where she began the study of conducting with Carl Bamberger. She continued her work with Joseph Rosenstock of the Metropolitan Opera, whose original strong misgivings about her prospects in the virtually all-male field of conducting were partially allayed by her manifest talent. Her work with the New York City Opera, with which she was associated from 1958 as rehearsal and audition pianist and later as performing pianist and finally assistant conductor, gave her practical experience, albeit slowly. An outdoor performance in Fairlawn, New Jersey, of a truncated version of Pietro Mascagni’s Cavalleria rusticana in 1966 was her first public appearance as a conductor.
In order to gain the opportunity to conduct professionally, Queler founded in 1971 the Opera Orchestra of New York, which also provided experience to instrumentalists and young singers. Their performances of  Claudio Monteverdi’s L’incoronazione di Poppea and Ottorino Respighi’s Belfagor in 1971, Gioacchino Rossini’s William Tell and Giacomo Meyerbeer’s L’Africana in 1972, and other works established the orchestra and Queler as fixtures of the New York musical scene. She went on to conduct more than 100 operas at Carnegie Hall. In 2011 Queler stepped down as music director.
A frequent guest conductor, Queler was the first American woman to conduct the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Montreal symphony orchestras. She published her memoir, A View from the Podium, in 2019. Queler received numerous honours, and in 2002 she was made a Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.
