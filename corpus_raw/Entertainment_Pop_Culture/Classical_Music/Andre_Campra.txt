André Campra,  (baptized  Dec. 4, 1660, Aix-en-Provence, France—died  June 29, 1744, Versailles), one of the most important French composers of operas and sacred music of the early 18th century.
Educated at Aix, Campra apparently became, at age 19, music master at Toulon Cathedral. He held similar posts at Arles in 1681 and Toulouse in 1683. In 1694 he became director of music at Notre-Dame in Paris, where he was the first to use strings in addition to the organ accompaniment to the services. Already well known for his motets, he turned to secular works, and his first opéra-ballet, L’Europe galante, was performed in 1697 under the name of his brother, Joseph Campra. In 1700 he gave up his church appointment and for 40 years enjoyed a wide reputation for his stage works.
The opéra-ballet, a genre that he initiated, became in his hands a charming vehicle for chain upon chain of danced and sung divertissements uncomplicated by any great dramatic unity. His religious music, which includes psalm settings, motets, and a mass, is admired for its power and beauty.
