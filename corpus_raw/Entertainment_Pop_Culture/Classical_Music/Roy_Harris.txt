Roy Harris, byname of Leroy Ellsworth Harris,  (born Feb. 12, 1898, Lincoln county, Okla., U.S.—died  Oct. 1, 1979, Santa Monica, Calif.), composer, teacher, and a prominent representative of nationalism in American music who came to be regarded as the musical spokesman for the American landscape.
Harris’s family moved to California during his childhood. He studied music at the University of California, Berkeley, and in Los Angeles, composing his first work at age 24. In 1926 he traveled to Paris to study composition with Nadia Boulanger, under whose tutelage he wrote his first significant work, Concerto for clarinet, piano, and string quartet (1927). After returning to the United States he taught music at the Juilliard School (1934–38) and the Westminster Choir School in Princeton, N.J. (1934–38). In 1936 he married pianist Beula Duffey (known after their marriage as Johana Harris), who advised him and worked with him on piano parts. He later held teaching positions at a number of American universities. From 1961 until his death he was professor and composer in residence at the University of California, Los Angeles (1961–70), and at California State University, Los Angeles (1971–76).
Harris’s works are marked by broad tonal melodies and asymmetrical rhythms. Many reflect American scenes and music, including the symphonic overture When Johnny Comes Marching Home (1934); the Symphony No. 4 (1940, Folksong Symphony); Kentucky Spring (1949); Symphony No. 6 (1944, Gettysburg Address); and Symphony No. 10 (1965, Abraham Lincoln Symphony).
Of his 16 symphonies, the best known and most often performed is the Symphony No. 3 (1939), written in a single movement with contrasting sections of lyrical and dramatic nature. The Symphony No. 5 (1942) has a vigorous proclamatory quality, and Symphony No. 7 (1952) shows his characteristic harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic features further strengthened and developed. In chamber music he followed classical models. He wrote three string quartets, a piano trio, a piano quintet, and a string quintet. Particularly interesting is the String Quartet No. 3 (1937), in the form of four preludes and fugues in modal harmony.
