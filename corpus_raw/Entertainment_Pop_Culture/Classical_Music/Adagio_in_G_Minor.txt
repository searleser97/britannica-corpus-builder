Adagio in G Minor,  composition attributed to Tomaso Albinoni. Widely familiar through its frequent use in film scores, the work is slow of pace, solemn of mood, and frequently transcribed for various combinations of instruments. It often appears on recordings of various short Baroque classics.
Actually, this famed work is not by Albinoni at all. It is a mid-20th century creation by Italian musicologist Remo Giazotto, who claimed to have found a fragment of an Albinoni composition in the archives of a German library. According to Giazotto, the fragment contained only the low-pitched supporting continuo part and a few phrases of the melody itself. From that meager beginning, Giazotto fleshed out a complete composition according to established Baroque principles of composition, creating something generally in the style of a chaconne, in which a set of repeated pitches underlies an evolving melody.
The new Adagio—supposedly only edited by Giazotto, though, in fact, nearly entirely his own work—was published by the Italian publishing house Ricordi in 1958, nearly three hundred years after Albinoni’s birth. Although it is not, strictly speaking, an Albinoni composition, it does bear characteristics of the Italian Baroque style, particularly in its overall structure.
It is a gentle and ethereal work, one that has helped to bring Albinoni back to the musical mainstream; it also served to preserve the name of Giazotto for future generations. Some scholars point out that even Giazotto’s origin story for the Adagio may be a fiction, as no one other than he ever saw this supposed Albinoni fragment whence the few phrases originated.
