National Symphony Orchestra (NSO),  American symphony orchestra based in Washington, D.C. It was founded in 1931 by Hans Kindler, who served as its first music director (1931–49). Subsequent directors have been Howard Mitchell (1949–69), Hungarian-born American Antal Dorati (1970–77), distinguished Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich (1977–94), Leonard Slatkin (music director-designate, 1994–96; music director, 1996–2008), and Christoph Eschenbach (2010–17). Gianandrea Noseda assumed the music directorship in 2017.
As the orchestra of the capital of the United States, the NSO performs for events of national and international significance. Originally based at Constitution Hall, the NSO has been housed, since 1986, in the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where it had performed regularly since the Center’s inaugural in 1971.
During his directorship, Dorati rebuilt the orchestra and extended its repertoire. In this period the NSO first achieved artistic recognition, made critically acclaimed recordings, and instituted the commissioning of new works.
Under Rostropovich, the NSO’s level of artistic achievement rose even higher. Commissions included works by Alfred Schnittke. Among the tours in which Rostropovich led the NSO were four to Europe and four to Asia, a 1990 trip to the Soviet Union, and a 1993 trip to Russia. Notable Rostropovich recordings include the complete opera Boris Godunov (by Modest Mussorgsky) and symphonies by Dmitry Shostakovich.
Since 1992 the NSO has participated in the Kennedy Center’s American Residencies outreach program. Through this initiative, the orchestra offers an array of performances, workshops, school presentations, and other events during one or more periods of “residency” in a selected state. By the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the orchestra had visited 20 states, with the eventual goal of visiting all 50.
