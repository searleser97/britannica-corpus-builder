Gypsy Melodies, Op. 55, Czech Cigánské melodie, German Zigeunermelodien,  song cycle by Bohemian composer Antonín Dvořák, with text by Czech poet Adolf Heyduk (1835–1923), celebrating the freedom of Roma (Gypsy) life. The song cycle was written for Gustav Walter, a tenor at Vienna’s Hofoper (Court Opera; precursor to the Staatsoper).
Each of the seven songs contains a romantic evocation of some aspect of the idealized nomadic life. Perhaps the best known of them is “Songs My Mother Taught Me,” the vocal part (or melody) of which has been transcribed for various instruments (e.g., cello, violin, piano) to create a purely instrumental piece.
