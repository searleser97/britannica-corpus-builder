Wilhelm Furtwängler, in full Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler,  (born Jan. 25, 1886, Berlin, Ger.—died  Nov. 30, 1954, near Baden-Baden, W.Ger.), German conductor, one of the great exponents of Romantic music. Known for his passionate, romantic style, he excelled as a conductor of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven and Richard Wagner.
The son of archaeologist Adolf Furtwängler, he studied in Munich, where he was assistant to the conductor Felix Mottl (1907–09). He became director of the Mannheim Opera in 1915 and in 1920 succeeded Richard Strauss as conductor of the Berlin Opera concerts. In 1922 he followed Arthur Nikisch as conductor of the Gewandhaus concerts in Leipzig. His other appointments included the directorships of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (1922), the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra (1930), the Bayreuth Festivals (1931–32), and the Berlin State Opera (1933). He subsequently toured Europe and England with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
Furtwängler conducted in Germany during most of the Nazi regime. Controversy arose when he led an orchestral version of Paul Hindemith’s opera Mathis der Maler with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1934—Hindemith had been denounced by the Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels and the work banned. Furtwängler resigned his position, but he returned to the orchestra in 1935. Although he was offered and accepted the post as conductor of the New York Philharmonic in 1936, the hostility of American musicians to his alleged Nazi associations caused him to resign. Public sentiment again caused the cancellation of a 1949 appointment as conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, although he had been formally exonerated of accusations of Nazi complicity.
