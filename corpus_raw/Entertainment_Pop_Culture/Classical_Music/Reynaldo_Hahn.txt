Reynaldo Hahn,  (born Aug. 9, 1874, Caracas, Venezuela—died  Jan. 28, 1947, Paris, France), Venezuelan-born French composer, remembered chiefly for his art songs.
Hahn went to Paris as a child and later studied at the Conservatoire under Jules Massenet. He was music critic of Le Figaro from 1934 and in 1945 became director of the Paris Opéra. His operettas, which were developments of the style established by Jacques Offenbach, include L’Île du rêve (1898) and Ciboulette (1923). He also wrote incidental music for plays by Edmond Rostand, Sacha Guitry, and others, as well as ballets, notably La Fête chez Thérèse (1910) and Le Dieu bleu (1912). His piano suite Portraits de peintres was inspired by poems of Marcel Proust, who portrayed Hahn in his novel Jean Santeuil. Several of his exquisite art songs, such as “Si mes vers avaient des ailes” (“If my verse had wings”), remain in the concert repertory. Hahn’s music is melodious and graceful. His memoirs are valuable sources for the musical and literary life of the time.
