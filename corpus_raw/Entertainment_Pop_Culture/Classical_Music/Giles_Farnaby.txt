Giles Farnaby,  (born c. 1560, Truro, Cornwall, Eng.—died  1640, London), English composer of virginal music and madrigals who ranks with the greatest keyboard composers of his day.
Farnaby was said to have come from the family of the schoolmaster and scholar Thomas Farnaby of Truro. He graduated as a bachelor of music from the University of Oxford in 1592. A cousin, Nicholas, was a maker of the small spinet of the day, the virginal, and Giles may have begun his musical activity in that way. His marked disregard for the prevailing conventions of written counterpoint seems to suggest the approach of a virginal player rather than that of a church-trained organist. Of the 52 pieces by him in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book, an early 17th-century collection, the most individual are such short and intimate ones as “His Dream” and “His Rest.” His larger sets of variations exploit a vein of virtuosity scarcely inferior to that of his eminent contemporary John Bull. Farnaby also composed a set of fresh canzonets (1598) and a number of psalm settings.
His son Richard is represented by four pieces in the same collection.
