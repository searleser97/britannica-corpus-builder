Postromantic music,   musical style typical of the last decades of the 19th century and first decades of the 20th century and characterized by exaggeration of certain elements of the musical Romanticism of the 19th century. Postromanticism exhibits extreme largeness of scope and design, a mixture of various musical forms (e.g., opera and symphony), and heightened contrapuntal complexity (i.e., a long or vast array, or both, of simultaneous but independent musical lines or events). Often Postromanticism also embraces vivid religious or mystical fervour, a sense of longing, and a sense of the grim and the grotesque.
Some composers often considered Postromantic include Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner, Ferruccio Busoni, Max Reger, Arnold Schoenberg, and Kaikhosru Sorabji. Postromanticism overlaps Neoromanticism, although the former term is more often applied to compositions showing important links in style and approach between Romanticism and early 20th-century modernism.
