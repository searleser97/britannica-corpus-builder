BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC SO),  British symphony orchestra, based in London and founded in 1930 by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The BBC SO has long been renowned for its championing of 20th-century and contemporary music. Through concerts, recordings, and radio broadcasts, the orchestra has introduced contemporary works, presented programs of all-British music, and performed seldom-heard compositions. It also has offered a range of works by Romantic and post-Romantic composers.
Notable music directors (and chief conductors) have included Sir Adrian Boult (1930–50), Sir Malcolm Sargent (1950–57; also chief conductor of the annual Promenade Concerts summer music festival [called “the Proms”]), Antal Dorati (1963–66), Sir Colin Davis (1967–71), Pierre Boulez (1971–75), Sir John Pritchard (1982–89), Andrew Davis (1989–2000), and Jirí Belohlávek (2006–12). In 2013 Sakari Oramo assumed the post of chief conductor.
Boult began the tradition of inviting contemporary composers to conduct and perform their own works in concerts. Arnold Schoenberg, Richard Strauss, Olivier Messiaen, Sergey Prokofiev, Béla Bartók, Zoltán Kodály, and Karlheinz Stockhausen have been among the most prominent of these composers. Some of the works were commissioned by the BBC SO; others were British premieres.
