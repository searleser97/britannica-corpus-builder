Philippe de Vitry, also called Philippus De Vitriaco,  (born Oct. 31, 1291, Paris, Fr.—died  June 9, 1361, Meaux), French prelate, music theorist, poet, and composer.
Vitry studied at the Sorbonne and was ordained a deacon at an early age. His earliest-known employment was as secretary to Charles IV. Later he became adviser to Charles and to his successors at the royal court at Paris, Philip VI and John II. Vitry served in many diplomatic and political missions in this capacity, several of them to the papal court in Avignon. During one such visit in 1351, Pope Clement VI appointed him bishop of Meaux.
Vitry was known as a poet and composer and was considered one of the leading intellectuals of his time. His scholarship and dedication were warmly praised by Petrarch, who regarded him as “the unparalleled poet of France.” Vitry’s historical eminence, however, is mainly derived from his contributions as a musician. He was the author of the famous and authoritative treatise of music Ars nova (c. 1320; “New Art”), which dealt with the theoretical aspects of French music in the first half of the 14th century. It included an explanation of new theories of mensural notation, a detailed account of the various uses and meanings of the coloured notes, and the introduction of additional durational symbols in the new notational system. (Modern scholars believe that, of the 24 chapters of the Ars nova, only the last 10 [dealing with mensural rhythm and notation] are original.)
Most of Vitry’s musical output was lost, judging from the many references to his motets that appear in the treatise. The extant pieces were published by Leo Schrade in Polyphonic Music of the 14th Century, vol. 1 (1956).
