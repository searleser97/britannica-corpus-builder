Robert Faesi,  (born April 10, 1883, Zürich, Switz.—died  Sept. 18, 1972, Zollikon), Swiss poet, dramatist, short-story writer, and literary critic, noted for his trilogy of novels on Zürich life and for important critical studies of literary figures.
Faesi combined his literary activity with a professorship of German literature at the University of Zürich from 1922 to 1953. His poems in the collections Aus der Brandung (1917; “From the Surge”) and Der brennende Busch (1928; “The Burning Bush”) are socially significant products of World War I and postwar Expressionism. His Füsilier Wipf (1917; rev. ed. 1938), the story of a soldier of World War I, became popular as a film. Zürcher Idylle (1908; rev. ed. 1950; “The Zürich Idyll”) and one of his most important works, the epic saga Die Stadt der Väter, Die Stadt der Freiheit, Die Stadt des Friedens, 3 vol. (1941–52; “The City of the Fathers,” “The City of Freedom,” “The City of Peace”), deal with Zürich life during the 18th century, including the period of the French Revolution. In 1949 Faesi wrote the libretto for Willy Burkhard’s opera Die schwarze Spinne (“The Black Spider”). Faesi also wrote important critical studies of Rainer Maria Rilke, Gottfried Keller, Thomas Mann, and other writers. His correspondence with Mann was published in 1962.
