Felix Weingartner, edler von Munzberg, in full Paul Felix Weingartner, edler (lord) von Munzberg,  (born June 2, 1863, Zara, Dalmatia, Austrian Empire [now Zadar, Croatia]—died May 7, 1942, Winterthur, Switzerland), Austrian symphonic and operatic conductor and composer, best-known for his interpretations of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven and Richard Wagner.
Weingartner first studied composition at Graz. Beginning as a student of philosophy at the University of Leipzig, he turned to the conservatory, on the recommendation of Johannes Brahms. In 1883 he became a student of Franz Liszt’s at Weimar, and in 1884 his opera Sakuntala was produced there. He was appointed court conductor of the Berlin Royal Opera in 1891 and led its symphony concerts until 1897. Moving to Munich in 1898, he conducted the Kaim concerts until 1905. In 1907 he succeeded Gustav Mahler as conductor of the Court Opera in Vienna and was conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic from 1908 to 1927. He directed the Vienna State Opera from late 1934 to 1936. In 1937 he became a Swiss citizen. He conducted in London beginning in 1898 with the Royal Philharmonic Society, the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Scottish Orchestra. He toured with the New York Philharmonic Society Orchestra in 1906 and conducted opera in Boston (1912–13). His conducting style, exemplified in his performances of Beethoven and Wagner, represented a reaction against the eccentric aspects of Romantic conducting and a move toward an ideal of craftsmanship.
Weingartner composed operas, incidental music, choral works, symphonies, concerti, chamber music, and songs. His pamphlet on conducting, “Über das Dirigieren” (1895; “On Conducting”), is famous. He did much editing of the works of Hector Berlioz. His memoirs, Lebenserinnerungen (1923; “Reminiscences”), were translated into English as Buffets and Rewards (1937).
