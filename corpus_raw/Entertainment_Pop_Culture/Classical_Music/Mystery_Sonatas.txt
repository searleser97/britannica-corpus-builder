Mystery Sonatas, also called Rosary Sonatas or Copper-Plate Engraving Sonatas,  group of 15 short sonatas and a passacaglia for violin and basso continuo written by Bohemian composer Heinrich Biber about 1674. Rooted in Biber’s longtime employment with the Roman Catholic Church and in the life of the Salzburg court in Austria, they are rare examples of strictly instrumental sacred music.
The Mystery Sonatas are not to be confused with Edward Elgar’s Enigma Variations. Biber used the word mystery in the religious sense of the word—as in the 15 mysteries of the rosary. The alternate name Copper-Plate Engraving Sonatas refers to pictures of each of the mysteries that were found in the manuscript of Biber’s work. They appear to be related to those images that occur in Rosary Psalters. Those books were published by rosary confraternities, groups of devout Catholics who assembled to reflect on the rosary and used such aids as prayers, quotations, and images to facilitate meditation.
One of the most noteworthy features of the Mystery Sonatas is Biber’s use of scordatura, or retuning. Nearly all of the sonatas require atypical tuning of the violin so as to make available different so-called double-stops, in which the player draws the bow across two adjacent strings simultaneously so that two notes combine and create unusual blends of tones. In the 11th sonata, “The Resurrection,” Biber requires the soloist to cross strings below the bridge and in the pegbox, creating a cross on the instrument itself.
The 15 sonatas are as follows (though translations vary):
Following the last of the sonatas is an elaborate passacaglia for solo violin built upon about five dozen repetitions of a single set of chords, with increasingly complicated melodic material overlying those chords.
