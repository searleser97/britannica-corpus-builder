Jonathan Miller, in full Sir Jonathan Wolfe Miller,  (born July 21, 1934, London, England—died November 27, 2019, London), English actor, director, producer, medical doctor, and man of letters noted for his wide-ranging abilities.
Miller was the son of a psychiatrist and a novelist. He graduated from St. John’s College, Cambridge, in 1956 and studied medicine at the University College School of Medicine of London University, from which he took a degree in medicine in 1959. Miller made his professional stage debut at the Edinburgh Festival in 1961 as actor and coauthor in the satirical review Beyond the Fringe. He left the show in 1963 to write television scripts and to direct live theatre. His sometimes controversial interpretations of classic works from William Shakespeare and Richard Sheridan to Alice in Wonderland gained him notoriety, and his appointment (1973) as associate director of the National Theatre—not noted for its innovative spirit—served only to frustrate him; he resigned in 1975.
Miller then became involved with the world of opera and directed, most notably, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin. In 1978 Miller wrote The Body in Question, a 13-part series on the history of medicine and of attitudes toward the human body, for the British Broadcasting Company; it also became a best-selling book. He continued his association with opera and theatre, not neglecting his interest in medicine. In 1980 he directed The Taming of the Shrew, the first in a series of TV movies based on stage productions. Other such credits included Antony & Cleopatra (1981), King Lear (1982), and Long Day’s Journey into Night (1987).
In 1988 Miller became artistic director of the Old Vic in London, but he resigned two years later, having overseen 16 productions. In 1991 he created the TV documentary series Madness, which was inspired, in part, by his years as a neuropsychology research fellow at the University of Sussex in the 1980s. His other television credits included Atheism: A Rough History of Disbelief (2004; also called Brief History of Disbelief), which explored the history of religious skepticism, including Miller’s own doubt. After a 10-year absence from the British stage, he directed The Cherry Orchard in 2007, drawing praise for the intimate yet expansive production. He subsequently oversaw several operatic productions, including La Bohème (2009) and Così fan tutte (2012), the latter of which he had filmed as a TV movie in 1986.
In 1983 Miller was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He was knighted in 2002.
