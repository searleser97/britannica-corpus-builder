Carlo Caproli, also called Carlo Del Violino, Caproli also spelled Caprioli,  (born c. 1615/20, Rome—died c. 1692/95, Rome?), Italian composer, violinist, and organist, considered by Angelo Berardi and others to be one of the best composers of cantatas of his time.
Caproli wrote his earliest datable cantata about the time that he was working as an organist at the German College in Rome (1643–45). He was a violinist at San Luigi dei Francesi from 1649 to 1670, in addition to performing a number of other music-related functions for various organizations in Rome. At the behest of Abbé Francesco Buti, who was literary agent of Jules Cardinal Mazarin (the first minister of France), Caproli composed, to Buti’s libretto, Le nozze di Peleo e di Theti (1654; music now lost), one of the first Italian operas heard in France. About 70 of his cantatas and canzoni are still extant.
