Philipp Jarnach,  (born July 26, 1892, Noisy, Fr.—died  Dec. 17, 1982, Börnsen, W.Ger.), German composer who was a follower of the pianist-composer Ferruccio Busoni.
The son of a noted Spanish sculptor, Jarnach studied piano under Edouard Risler and harmony under Albert Lavignac in Paris. In 1915 at Zürich he met Busoni, whose operas Arlecchino and Turandot he arranged for piano and under whose influence he wrote his String Quintet, Opus 10. In 1927 he was appointed professor of composition at the Cologne conservatory. He took German citizenship in 1931, and in 1949 he became director of the Hamburg conservatory. Among his chamber works, which show an affinity with the music of Paul Hindemith, are two sonatas for unaccompanied violin and the String Quartet, Opus 16 (1924), which established his reputation in Germany as a composer. His orchestral works include Musik mit Mozart and Morgenklangspiel. He completed Busoni’s opera Doktor Faust after the composer’s death.
