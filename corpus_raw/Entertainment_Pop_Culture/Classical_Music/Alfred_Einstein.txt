Alfred Einstein,  (born Dec. 30, 1880, Munich—died  Feb. 13, 1952, El Cerrito, Calif., U.S.), eminent German-American musicologist and critic.
Einstein was born into a family of scholars (Albert Einstein was his cousin), and, as a young man, studied law for a year before completing his doctorate (1903) in musicology and composition at the University of Munich. As the first editor (1918–33) of the Zeitschrift für Musikwissenschaft (“Journal of Musicology”), he held a position of considerable authority in his field. Einstein lived in Munich until 1927, where he was also the music critic of the Münchner Post. From 1927 to 1933 he was music critic for the Berliner Tageblatt. After the advent of the Nazi regime, he settled first in London and then near Florence. In 1939 he came to the United States, which became his permanent home, and taught music at Smith College until his retirement in 1950. He also taught at Columbia University, Princeton, the University of Michigan, and Yale. His writings include Geschichte der Musik (1917; A Short History of Music, 1936) and many valuable papers for the publications of the International Music Society and other learned editions; his articles for the Musical Quarterly are especially notable. A skilled editor, Einstein revised Riemann’s Musik Lexicon (1919–29) and Köchel’s catalogue of Mozart’s works (1937) and produced new editions of Mozart’s last 10 string quartets and a biography, Mozart, His Character, His Work (1945). His most significant work, however, is considered to be The Italian Madrigal, 3 vol. (1949), which was the first comprehensive study of this subject in any language.
