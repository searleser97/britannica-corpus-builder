George Antheil, in full Georg Johann Carl Antheil,  (born July 8, 1900, Trenton, N.J., U.S.—died  Feb. 12, 1959, New York City), American composer known for his ultramodern music in the 1920s.
Antheil studied with Ernest Bloch in New York. In 1922 he went to Europe, gave piano recitals, and became prominent in the literary and artistic circles of the Parisian avant-garde. Antheil’s most celebrated work, Le Ballet mécanique, scored for player pianos, automobile horns, electric bells, and airplane propellers, produced a hostile outcry in Paris (1926) and New York (1927); on its revival in 1954 it was considered fairly tame. In 1936 Antheil moved to Hollywood and subsequently produced many film scores, among them Tokyo Joe (1949), Angels over Broadway (1940), and Fighting Kentuckians (1950). After about 1939 he abandoned the avant-garde style for a mixture of Classicism, Romanticism, and Impressionism. His other works include eight symphonies; the ballet Capital of the World (1953); chamber music; and the operas Transatlantic (1930), Helen Retires (1934), Volpone (1953), and The Wish (1955). He wrote an autobiography, Bad Boy of Music (1945).
