Michel-Richard Delalande,  Delalande also spelled De Lalande,  (born Dec. 15, 1657, Paris—died  June 18, 1726, Versailles, Fr.), leading composer of sacred music in France in the early 18th century, one of the few composers who asserted any influence while Jean-Baptiste Lully lived.
He became a chorister at Saint-Germain l’Auxerrois and learned to play several instruments. An organist at four Paris churches, he was asked to direct the musical education of the daughters of Louis XIV. In 1683 he became a superintendent of the Chapel Royal, and he was in sole control of all sacred music at court by 1704. He was also in charge of the royal chamber music.
Delalande’s fame rests upon his 42 motets for chorus and orchestra written for the chapel at Versailles. His counterpoint is firm, his handling of the texts masterly, and his admixture of French and Italian styles well contrived; what Lully did for opera in France, Delalande did for sacred music. Of his instrumental music the Symphonies pour les soupers du roi was so appreciated by Louis XIV that he ordered André Philidor to copy the complete set in 1703. Delalande also wrote secular cantatas and pastorals and music for dramatic presentations of the sacred tragedies produced by the Jesuit College in Paris.
