Nicolas de Grigny,  (baptized Sept. 8, 1672, Reims, France—died Nov. 30, 1703, Reims), French organist and composer, member of a family of musicians in Reims.
Grigny was organist (1693–95) at the abbey church of Saint-Denis in Paris. By 1696 he had returned to Reims and shortly thereafter was appointed organist at the cathedral there, a post he held until his death. His organ music is distinguished for its rich texture, complex counterpoint, and expressive melody and for its free exploitation of the contrasting colours of the instrument. His volume Premier livre d’orgue (1699; “First Book of the Organ”) sums up the work of his predecessors and stands with that of François Couperin at the apex of the French classical organ tradition. J.S. Bach so admired it that he transcribed the entire volume for his own use.
