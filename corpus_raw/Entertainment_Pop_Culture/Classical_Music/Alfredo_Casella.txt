Alfredo Casella,  (born July 25, 1883, Turin, Italy—died  March 5, 1947, Rome), composer, pianist, conductor, and teacher whose cosmopolitan outlook permeated 20th-century Italian music.
Casella studied in Paris, where he remained until 1914. After touring as a pianist he returned to Italy in 1915. In 1917 he founded the National Society of Music, soon renamed the Italian Society of Modern Music, and he also helped to revive interest in early Italian music. He also published valuable editions of the keyboard works of J.S. Bach, W.A. Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Frédéric Chopin.
His early symphonies (1905–09) show some influence of Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler and his later chamber and orchestral works that of Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky. He established a more personal style in the ballet La Giara (1924; The Jar) and in the orchestral works Scarlattiana (1926) and Paganiniana (1942). Other notable works were Italia for orchestra (1910), the Partita for piano and orchestra (1925), and the Missa solemnis (1944).
