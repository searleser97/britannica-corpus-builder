John Dexter,  (born Aug. 2, 1925, Derby, Derbyshire, Eng.—died  March 23, 1990, London), British director of stage plays and operas.
Dexter, who left school at the age of 14, served in the British army during World War II and began acting while in the army. In 1957 he joined the Royal Court Theatre in London as an associate director; he then became associate director of the National Theatre (1963–66, 1971–75), director of production (1974–81) and production adviser (1981–84) at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, and director of productions on Broadway and London’s West End.
Although admired for his productions of classical works, Dexter was especially successful directing new plays such as Arnold Wesker’s Roots (1959) and The Kitchen (1959) and Peter Shaffer’s Royal Hunt of the Sun (1964; U.S. staging, 1965) and Equus (1973; U.S., 1974); he won American Theatre Wing “Tony” awards for his New York productions of Equus and David Henry Hwang’s M. Butterfly (1988). Dexter had particular success with his Metropolitan productions of contemporary operas, including Francis Poulenc’s Dialogues des Carmèlites (1977), Alban Berg’s Lulu (in two acts, 1977; expanded to three acts, 1980), and Kurt Weill’s The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (1979).
