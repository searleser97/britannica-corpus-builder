Matthew Locke,  (born c. 1621–23, Exeter, Devon, Eng.—died  August 1677, London), leading English composer for the stage in the period before Henry Purcell.
By 1661 Locke had been appointed composer in ordinary to the king. After his conversion to Roman Catholicism he was appointed organist to the queen. With Christopher Gibbons he wrote the music for James Shirley’s masque Cupid and Death (1653), possibly the most elaborate masque of the period. He also wrote part of the music for Sir William Davenant’s The Siege of Rhodes (1656), which is usually considered the first English opera. Other stage works were music for Thomas Shadwell’s Psyche (1675), for Davenant’s version of Macbeth (revised 1673), and for Shadwell’s version of The Tempest (1674). In The Tempest Locke used for the first time in English music directions such as “soft” and “louder by degrees” and included tremolos for stringed instruments.
Locke’s instrumental music, which is harmonically less daring than his vocal music, is considered among the finest of the 17th century; an example is the Little Consort of Three Parts (1656) for viols. He also wrote music for the coronation festivities of Charles II and anthems for the Chapel Royal. His treatise Melothesia (1673) was one of the earliest English works to deal with “Certain General Rules for playing upon a Continued Bass.”
