Peter Sellars,  (born September 27, 1957, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American stage director. He is best known for staging plays and operas for numerous international theatres in settings far different than those suggested by the text.
Sellars attended Harvard University, where he began developing his innovative style of directing. His controversial production of Ajax (1986) took the form of a post-Vietnam military trial. Among his many striking opera productions, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Don Giovanni was staged in an urban ghetto, his Così fan tutte in a diner, and his Marriage of Figaro in a corporate high-rise. He collaborated with John Adams on the operas Nixon in China (1987), Doctor Atomic (2005), and A Flowering Tree (2006).
