Lotte Lenya, original name Karoline Blamauer,  (born October 18, 1898, Vienna, Austria—died November 27, 1981, New York, New York, U.S.), Austrian actress-singer who popularized much of the music of her first husband, the composer Kurt Weill, and appeared frequently in the musical dramas of Weill and his longtime collaborator Bertolt Brecht.
Lenya studied ballet and drama in Zurich from 1914 to 1920, was a member of the corps de ballet at the Zürich Stadttheater, and played in Shakespeare in Berlin in the 1920s. She married Weill in 1926 and appeared in the controversial Brecht–Weill work Mahagonny (“Little Mahagonny”) at the Baden-Baden Festival in 1927. She alternated in the roles of Jenny and Lucy in Die Dreigroschenoper (1928; “The Threepenny Opera”) and starred in other Weill vehicles, among them a full-length operatic version of Mahagonny, entitled Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny (1930; “The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny”).
Fleeing Nazi Germany, Lenya and Weill went to Paris in 1933, where she appeared in Die sieben Todsünden (1933; “The Seven Deadly Sins”), a ballet-drama written for her by Brecht and Weill. From Paris the Weills moved to New York City; Lenya made her U.S. debut as Miriam in The Eternal Road (1937). She appeared as Cissy in Candle in the Wind (1944) and Duchess in The Firebrand of Florence (1945), after which she retired for a few years to assist Weill with composing. After his death in 1950, she returned to the stage as Xantippe in Barefoot in Athens (1951) and, throughout the 1950s, played in revivals of previous plays, most notably the long-running, off-Broadway production of The Threepenny Opera, as well as in several Kurt Weill Memorial Concerts. Lenya also played in the revue Brecht on Brecht (New York City and London, 1962), Mother Courage and Her Children (at the Ruhr Festival, Recklinghausen, West Germany, 1965), and Cabaret (1966).
Lenya also appeared in several films, including Die Dreigroschenoper (1930), The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1960), From Russia with Love (1963), and The Appointment (1969); for her portrayal in Roman Spring Lenya was nominated for an Academy Award in 1961. She also did extensive recording, made television appearances, and performed in concert in West Germany and the United States.
