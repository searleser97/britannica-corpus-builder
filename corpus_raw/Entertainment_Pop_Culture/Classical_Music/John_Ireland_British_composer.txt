John Ireland,  (born August 13, 1879, Bowdon, Cheshire, Eng.—died  June 12, 1962, Washington, Sussex), English composer known for his songs and his programmatic orchestral works.
Ireland studied at the Royal College of Music in London, where he later taught composition. He was much drawn to the mysticism and fantasy in the writings of Arthur Machen; some of his compositions, such as The Forgotten Rite (1913; for orchestra), were inspired by Machen. His songs, which include settings of poems of Shakespeare, A.E. Housman, and Rupert Brooke, are noted for their subtle evocation of mood. His works include A London Overture, the piano suite Sarnia (1940–41), a piano concerto, and the London Pieces (1917–20), for piano.
