Arthur Fiedler,  (born December 17, 1894, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died  July 10, 1979, Brookline, Massachusetts), American conductor who was maestro of the Boston Pops Orchestra for 50 seasons and the best-selling classical conductor of all time; his recordings with the Pops sold some 50,000,000 discs. (The Boston Pops Orchestra is the Boston Symphony minus its principal players.) Fiedler, whose principal aim was “to give audiences a good time,” led the Pops in performances of popular tunes, show music, and classics.
From 1911 to 1915 Fiedler studied violin, piano, and conducting at the Royal Academy of Music in Berlin before joining the Boston Symphony as a member of the second violin section. He played in the viola section from 1918 to 1930. He also was proficient on the celesta, piano, and organ. Fiedler organized the Arthur Fiedler Sinfonietta (1924), a chamber symphony, when he was refused the conductorship of the Pops. In 1929 he organized the Esplanade concerts, in which symphonic music was played outdoors in Boston for the first time. In 1930 he became conductor of the Pops, a post he held until his death in 1979.
As conductor of the Boston Pops, Fiedler developed a varied and light-hearted repertoire that struck a responsive chord with the public. He excelled at adapting popular dance music and other songs to performance by a symphonic orchestra. Fiedler was viewed by many critics as a highly able technician and a superb showman rather than as a first-rate interpreter of classical music, however.
