Sir Tyrone Guthrie, in full Sir William Tyrone Guthrie,  (born July 2, 1900, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, Eng.—died May 15, 1971, Newbliss, County Monaghan, Ire.), British theatrical director whose original approach to Shakespearean and modern drama greatly influenced the 20th-century revival of interest in traditional theatre. He was knighted in 1961.
Guthrie graduated from the University of Oxford and in 1923 made his professional debut as an actor and assistant manager of the Oxford Repertory Company. He was briefly an announcer and director for the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) and directed the 1926–27 season of the Scottish National Theatre troupe. He then returned to the BBC to become one of the first writers to create plays designed for radio performance.
As director of productions at the Festival Theatre, Cambridge (1929–30), he experimented with new approaches to traditional theatre. James Bridie’s Anatomist, Guthrie’s first independent production, was staged at the Westminster Theatre, London, in 1931. His next production, Luigi Pirandello’s Six Characters in Search of an Author, in 1932, established his reputation as a creative director.
Guthrie’s work at the Old Vic and Sadler’s Wells theatres, London, brought him recognition as a major director. During 1933–34 and 1936–45 he was the director of the Shakespeare Repertory Company, which performed at the two theatres.
During the 1940s Guthrie was critically acclaimed for his direction of operas such as Benjamin Britten’s Peter Grimes (1946) and Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac (1946). One of Guthrie’s best-known operas, the strikingly realistic English-language version of Bizet’s Carmen, was performed at Sadler’s Wells Theatre (1949) and at the Metropolitan Opera House (1952) in New York City.
Guthrie produced his own play, Top of the Ladder, at the St. James Theatre, London, in 1950. His 1953 productions of Shakespeare’s Richard III and All’s Well That Ends Well at the first Shakespeare Festival at Stratford, Ont., were considered outstanding achievements. He continued at Stratford for the next four seasons, strongly influencing the development of Canadian theatre.
The Tyrone Guthrie Theater (1963) in Minneapolis, Minn., modeled after the Stratford Theatre, adopted a thrust stage and followed Guthrie’s tenets for creating effective drama as outlined in his two major publications, Theatre Prospect (1932) and A Life in the Theatre (1959).
