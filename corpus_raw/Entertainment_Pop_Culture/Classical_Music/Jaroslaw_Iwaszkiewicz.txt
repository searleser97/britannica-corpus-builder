Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz,  (born February 20, 1894, Kalnik, Russian Empire [now in Ukraine]—died  March 2, 1980, Stawisko, near Warsaw, Poland), Polish poet, novelist, playwright, and essayist whose reputation rests largely on his achievements in new poetic forms.
Iwaszkiewicz studied law at the University of Kiev from 1912 to 1918. During the same period he attended the music conservatory, where he was closely associated with composer Karol Szymanowski, for whose opera Król Roger (“King Roger”) he wrote a libretto in 1926. After moving to Warsaw in 1918, Iwaszkiewicz published his first collection of poems, Oktostychy (1919; “Octoverses”), and was a cofounder with several other poets of the Skamander group. Between 1923 and 1935 Iwaszkiewicz was active in political life and diplomatic service, but he continued to write poetry, novels, and drama that made him one of the leading writers of the period.
During World War II, Iwaszkiewicz provided a much-needed shelter for intellectual life on his small estate, Stawisko, near Warsaw. After the war he associated himself with the Defenders of Peace movement, a pro-Soviet organization of leftist intellectuals, and continued his political activities. He also edited the literary monthly Twórczość (“Creation”) from 1955 until 1980. He was president of the Union of Polish Writers twice during the 1940s and from 1959 to 1980.
Iwaszkiewicz’s poems, which appeared in Oktostychy, Księga dnia i księga nocy (1929; “The Book of Day and the Book of Night”), and Wiersze zebrane (1968; “Collected Poems”), among other publications, are in many cases lyrical evocations of the Polish landscape. His prose production, which takes such varied forms as essays, plays, biographies, short stories, novels, and translations, includes the short-story collection Opowiadania (1954; “Stories”) and the novel Sława i chwała, 3 vol. (1956–62; “Fame and Glory”). The latter is an examination of the turbulent Polish society from 1914 to 1947.
