Aleksandr Grechaninov, in full Aleksandr Tikhonovich Grechaninov, Grechaninov also spelled Gretchaninov,  (born Oct. 13 [Oct. 25, New Style], 1864, Moscow, Russia—died Jan. 4, 1956, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Russian composer notable for his religious works and children’s music.
Grechaninov studied piano and composition at the Moscow Conservatory, and from 1890 to 1893 he worked at composition and orchestration with Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. He soon became known for his songs and for two pieces, String Quartet in G Major and the first of his five symphonies, both composed in 1894. An opera, Dobrynya Nikitich, was produced by the Bolshoi Theatre in 1903, with the famed basso profundo Feodor Chaliapin in the title role. Nine years later the opera Soeur Beatrice (“Sister Beatrice”) was mounted but immediately withdrawn as an affront to religion. Grechaninov composed in all media and produced a great quantity of piano music, songs, and choruses, all without a real personal stamp. His later religious music was written for instrumental accompaniment and thus could not be used in Eastern Orthodox liturgy.
Grechaninov received a pension for his religious music until the Revolution of 1917. He then moved to western Europe, settling in Paris in 1925. In 1939 he immigrated to the United States (which he had visited frequently since 1929), and he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1946.
