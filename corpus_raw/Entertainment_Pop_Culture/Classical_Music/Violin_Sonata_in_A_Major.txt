Violin Sonata in A Major,  sonata for violin and piano by Belgian composer César Franck, known for its deftly balanced violin and piano parts and for its cyclic form (possessing a theme or motif that recurs across multiple movements of the work). The piece was written for the Belgian violinist Eugène Ysaÿe on the occasion of his marriage in 1886. Ysaÿe first performed the work at his own wedding celebration and later played it for its public premiere in Brussels at the end of that year. The piece is among Franck’s most frequently performed compositions.
Although Franck produced very little chamber music, his Violin Sonata has earned a place as a concert favourite largely because of the broad appeal of its songlike melodies. Unlike most of his instrumental works, which contain three movements, the Violin Sonata contains four. The soulful character of the first movement, “Allegretto ben moderato,” gives way to swirling turbulence in the sonata-form second movement, “Allegro.” The third movement, “Recitativo-fantasia,” offers mournful, seemingly spontaneous (fantasia-like) minor-mode melodies, and in the final movement, “Allegretto poco mosso,” the piano and the violin soar to their upper registers in passionate dialogue, with phrases of one part often recurring in the other. The undulating contours of the opening melodies of the first movement echo throughout the piece.
