Riccardo Muti,  (born July 28, 1941, Naples, Italy), Italian conductor of both opera and the symphonic repertory. He became one of the most respected and charismatic conductors of his generation.
As a child, Muti studied piano at the conservatory of Naples. Later he spent five years at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory of Milan, studying composition and conducting. Following a successful debut with the Italian Radio Symphony Orchestra in 1968, he appeared as a conductor with leading orchestras in Europe and the United States. He served as principal conductor of the Florence Maggio Musicale from 1969 to 1980, and he succeeded Otto Klemperer as principal conductor of the New Philharmonia (after 1977, Philharmonia Orchestra) of London in 1973. He remained principal conductor until 1979 and was music director from 1979 to 1982. In 1977 he became the principal guest conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and he served as its music director from 1980 to 1992.
Muti became music director of La Scala in Milan in 1986; he left the position in April 2005 following widely reported disputes between the administration he had led and the theatre’s artistic unions. After leaving La Scala, Muti maintained a steady guest-conducting schedule with several of the world’s leading orchestras, and in 2010 he took the baton as permanent music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO). His first season with the CSO was a distressing one, however. Not only was he forced to cancel several appearances because of severe stomach pain, but early in 2011 he fainted during a rehearsal, fracturing several bones in his face when he fell from the podium. During his recovery he became the second recipient (2011) of the million-dollar prize established by Swedish soprano Birgit Nilsson; the deciding body cited his exceptional contributions to opera and the concert tradition. His recording of Giuseppe Verdi’s Requiem with the CSO (2010) also received two Grammy Awards (best classical album and best choral performance). Muti returned to the podium at the CSO later in 2011, conducting performances of Verdi’s operaOtello.
Muti led the first modern uncut performance of Gioachino Rossini’s William Tell in Florence in 1972, and he championed lesser-known works by Verdi as well as operas by Giacomo Meyerbeer and Gaspare Spontini. He was respected as a conductor of a wide range of orchestral and choral works, including large-scale symphonic works from the 20th century. Muti also conducted the Vienna Philharmonic in its annual New Year’s concert on a number of occasions (1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2018, and 2021).
Muti published several books, including An Autobiography: First the Music, Then the Words (2011). In 2018 he was the recipient of the Japan Art Association’s prestigious Praemium Imperiale for music.
