Dame Nellie Melba, original name Helen Armstrong, née Helen Mitchell,  (born May 19, 1861, Richmond, near Melbourne, Austl.—died Feb. 23, 1931, Sydney), Australian coloratura soprano, a singer of great popularity.
She sang at Richmond (Australia) Public Hall at the age of six and was a skilled pianist and organist, but she did not study singing until after her marriage to Charles Nesbitt Armstrong in 1882. She appeared in Sydney in 1885 and in London in 1886 and then studied in Paris. She made her operatic debut as Gilda in Verdi’s Rigoletto in 1887 at Brussels under the name Melba, derived from that of the city of Melbourne. Until 1926 she sang in the principal opera houses of Europe and the United States, particularly Covent Garden and the Metropolitan Opera, excelling in Delibes’s Lakmé, as Marguerite in Gounod’s Faust, and as Violetta in Verdi’s La traviata. Her marriage was dissolved in 1900.
She was created a Dame of the British Empire in 1918. In 1925 she published Melodies and Memories. She returned in 1926 to Australia, where she became president of the Melbourne Conservatorium. Melba toast and peach Melba were named for her.
