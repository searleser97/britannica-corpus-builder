Henry Hadley,   (born Dec. 20, 1871, Somerville, Mass., U.S.—died  Sept. 6, 1937, New York, N.Y.), one of the most prominent American composers of his day.
Hadley studied in Boston and Vienna and in 1904 went to Germany, where in 1909 he conducted his one-act opera Safié. He conducted the Seattle Symphony Orchestra (1909–11), the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (1911–15), and the Manhattan Symphony Orchestra (1929–32) and was associate conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra (1920–27).
His music, which was heavily influenced by that of Richard Wagner, is Romantic in style, with some Impressionistic touches. After the mid-20th century it was seldom performed. His works include the operas Azora, the Daughter of Montezuma (1917), Bianca (1918), and Cleopatra’s Night (1920); five symphonies; symphonic poems and suites; chamber music; choral works; and songs.
