John Bury,  (born January 27, 1925, Aberystwyth, Cardiganshire [now Ceredigion], Wales—died November 12, 2000, Burleigh, Gloucestershire, England), British set designer whose bold, stylized sets—which often incorporated such materials as metal, glass, and brick and featured dramatic architectural structures—were a radical departure from the painted, decorative sets that had characterized traditional British theatre.
After serving in the British navy during World War II, Bury pursued a variety of jobs before joining the Theatre Workshop in London. Collaborating with the director Joan Littlewood, who founded and oversaw the company, Bury developed his transformative approach to set design during the 1950s and early ’60s. He became the head of design for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1964, and he held the same position for the Royal National Theatre from 1973 to 1985; in both roles he worked closely with the director Peter Hall. Bury also created sets for the Royal Opera House and the Glyndebourne Festival Opera.
In 1981 he won Tony Awards for best set design and best lighting for the Broadway production of Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus. Bury was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1979.
