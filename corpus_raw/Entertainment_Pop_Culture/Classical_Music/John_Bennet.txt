John Bennet,  (born c. 1575), English composer known chiefly for his madrigals, which ranged from light and festive in character to serious and even solemn.
Almost nothing is known about Bennet’s life, but the dedication in his 1599 book of madrigals suggests that he came from northwest England. In his madrigals Bennet was known to have occasionally borrowed texts from existing collections and reset them to original tunes; he did not, however, borrow tunes. One of Bennet’s sources for such texts was Thomas Morley, to whose Triumphs of Oriana Bennet contributed the well-known madrigal “All creatures now are merry-minded.” In addition to two volumes of madrigals, he composed a serious piece, for viol accompaniment, to celebrate Queen Elizabeth I and a verse anthem “for the King’s inauguration,” O God of Gods.
