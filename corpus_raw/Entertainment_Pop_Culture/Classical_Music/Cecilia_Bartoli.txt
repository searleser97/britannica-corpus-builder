Cecilia Bartoli,  (born June 4, 1966, Rome, Italy), Italian operatic mezzo-soprano who achieved global stardom with her outstanding vocal skills and captivating stage presence.
Both of Bartoli’s parents were members of the Rome Opera chorus, and she joked that when she was a child, her babysitters were the likes of Rossini and Verdi. She started singing when she was a teenager, and her mother, who coached her, remained her only voice teacher. At age 19, she embarked on a professional career when she sang on a television show with baritone Leo Nucci. Soon after, she attracted the attention of conductors Herbert von Karajan and Daniel Barenboim, both of whom recognized her as an abundantly talented singer with a voice perfectly suited to the difficult coloratura repertoire of Mozart and Rossini.
Bartoli’s roles included Rosina in Rossini’s Barber of Seville and the title role in his Cenerentola, as well as Cherubino in Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro and Dorabella in his Così fan tutte. She also took on roles (Zerlina in Mozart’s Don Giovanni and Despina in Così fan tutte) usually sung by sopranos. A number of her recordings, including If You Love Me (1992), a collection of 18th-century Italian love songs, and collections of Rossini and Mozart arias and songs, were very popular and appeared on the classical best-seller charts. Bartoli continued to conduct her career in a thoughtful and measured way, however, taking on new roles only when she felt ready and limiting her appearances each season. In 1993 she made her U.S. stage debut in Houston, and three years later she made her debut (as Despina) at the Metropolitan Opera. By the early 21st century, Bartoli had become one of classical music’s most popular performers, selling millions of albums and routinely selling out concert halls wherever she appeared.
