Alexander Agricola,  (born 1446, Flanders—died  1506, Valladolid, Spain), composer of the late Burgundian polyphonic school.
Agricola was educated in the Netherlands and entered the service of Charles VII of France. He later went to Milan and in 1474 was at the court of Lorenzo de’ Medici. The same year he returned to the Netherlands. In 1500 he became chaplain and chanter to Philip the Fair of Burgundy, whom he accompanied to Spain. His works appear widely in contemporary printed music books and are noted for their rhythmic ingenuity. They include masses, motets, French chansons, and Italian carnival songs.
