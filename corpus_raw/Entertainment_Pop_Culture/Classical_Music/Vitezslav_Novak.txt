Vítězslav Novák,  (born December 5, 1870, Kamenice nad Lipou, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary [now in Czech Republic]—died July 18, 1949, Skutec, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic]), Czech composer who was one of the principal proponents of nationalism in Czech music and the teacher of many Czech composers of the 20th century.
Novák studied under Antonín Dvořák at the Prague Conservatory and in 1909 began teaching there. His early works were influenced by German Romantic music, but, after a visit to Moravia, he began to write music that reflected the spirit of his homeland and made use of its folk music. He was also influenced by Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss. His works include four operas, two ballets, and the orchestral works V Tatrach (“In the Tatra”) and the Slovakian Suite. The De Profundis for orchestra and the May Symphony were written during World War II. He also composed chamber works, songs, and choral works.
