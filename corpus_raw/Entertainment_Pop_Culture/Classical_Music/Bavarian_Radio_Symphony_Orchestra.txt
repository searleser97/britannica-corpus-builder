Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, German Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks,  German symphony orchestra based in Munich and supported by the state of Bavaria. Under the aegis of the Bavarian state radio station, conductor Eugen Jochum organized the performing group in 1949, trained it to become a major orchestra, and took it to perform at the prestigious Edinburgh International Festival in 1957. Jochum continued to conduct the orchestra until 1960. In 1961 Raphael Kubelik became the orchestra’s second chief conductor; he held the position until 1979. Unlike Jochum, who had favoured music from the Romantic and Classical periods, Kubelik selected music from more-recent eras as well. Under Kubelik, some of the orchestra’s concerts of contemporary music included guest conductors such as Paul Hindemith and Igor Stravinsky. Sir Colin Davis conducted the orchestra in the1980s, followed by Lorin Maazel in the 1990s. In 2003 the post was assumed by Mariss Jansons.
