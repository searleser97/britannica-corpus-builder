Werner Egk, original name Werner Mayer,  (born May 17, 1901, Auchsesheim, near Donauwörth, Ger.—died  July 10, 1983, Inning, W.Ger.), German composer primarily of music for the theatre.
Egk studied composition with Carl Orff in Munich, where he settled and composed music for puppet plays and radio plays. He conducted his own first opera for the stage, Die Zaubergeige (1935), in Frankfurt am Main.
His operas and ballets, often satirical, usually portray historical or legendary figures, and he wrote his own librettos. The immediate appeal of Egk’s music was due largely to its neo-romantic spirit. His primary influence was Igor Stravinsky. In 1938, while in Berlin, he conducted his highly successful opera, Peer Gynt (after Henrik Ibsen), one of his most popular stage works. His ballets, such as Abraxas (1948) and Casanova in London (1969), also attracted wide attention. Abraxas was banned, after five sold-out performances, on grounds of obscenity. Egk also wrote instrumental music.
