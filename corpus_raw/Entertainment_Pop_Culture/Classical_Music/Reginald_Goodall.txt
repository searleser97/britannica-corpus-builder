Sir Reginald Goodall,  (born July 13, 1901, Lincoln, Lincolnshire, Eng.—died  May 5, 1990, near Canterbury, Kent), British conductor noted for his interpretations of operas, especially those of Richard Wagner.
Goodall studied at the Royal College of Music in London and in Munich, Salzburg, and Vienna before joining the Sadler’s Wells company in 1944. The next year he conducted the first performance of Benjamin Britten’s opera Peter Grimes, and in 1946 he shared the podium at the Glyndebourne premiere of Britten’s The Rape of Lucretia. He remained primarily a staff conductor and vocal coach at the Royal Opera House until 1968, when he conducted Richard Wagner’s Die Meistersinger at Sadler’s Wells; critics praised the richness and fluidity of his interpretation.
Sadler’s Wells then commissioned Goodall to prepare new productions in English of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung), a project that resulted in two performances of the four-opera cycle in 1973. He achieved equal success with Parsifal (1971, 1986) and Tristan und Isolde (1979) and with best-selling recordings. He was knighted in 1985.
