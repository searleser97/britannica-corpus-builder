Giovanni Battista Rubini,  (born April 7, 1794, Romano, republic of Venice [Italy]—died  March 3, 1854, Romano), Italian tenor remembered as the major early exponent of the Romantic style of Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti.
Rubini showed early musical promise and was engaged as violinist and chorister at the Riccardi Theatre in Bergamo at the age of 12. He made his professional debut in Pietro Generali’s Le lagrime d’una vedova at Pavia in 1814, then sang for 10 years in Naples in the smaller, comic opera houses. In 1825 he sang the leading roles in Gioacchino Rossini’s La Cenerentola, Otello, and La donna del lago in Paris, establishing himself as the leading tenor of his day. His first Bellini role came the next year, when he premiered Bianca e Gernando in Naples. Bellini worked closely with Rubini when he wrote his operas; Rubini sang the tenor leads in Il pirata (1827), La sonnambula (1831), and I Puritani (1835). Performing with him in the premiere of the latter were the soprano Giulia Grisi and the baritone Antonio Tamburini. Along with Luigi Lablache, this stellar group, which continued to perform together, was popularly referred to as the “Puritani quartet.”
Rubini’s Donizetti premieres included La lettera anonima (1822), Elvida (1826), Il giovedì grasso (1827), Gianni di Calais (1828), Il paria (1829), Anna Bolena (1830), and Marino Faliero (1835). From 1831 to 1843 he divided the year between the Théâtre-Italien in Paris and His Majesty’s Theatre in the Haymarket, London. He toured Germany and Holland with Franz Liszt in 1843 and later that year performed in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Czar Nicholas I appointed him Director of Singing and Colonel of the Imperial Music. Two years later he retired to his birthplace, where he bought a palazzo, which after his death became the Rubini museum.
