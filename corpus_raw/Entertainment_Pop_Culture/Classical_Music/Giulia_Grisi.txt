Giulia Grisi,  (born July 28, 1811, Milan, Italy—died  Nov. 29, 1869, Berlin, Prussia [Germany]), Italian soprano whose brilliant dramatic voice established her as an operatic prima donna for more than 30 years.
Grisi made her debut at the age of 17 in Gioacchino Rossini’s Zelmira, and in 1830 Vincenzo Bellini wrote for her the part of Giulietta in I Capuleti ed i Montecchi. At 20 in Milan she created the part of Adalgisa in Bellini’s Norma, then broke her Milan contract and went to Paris, where she appeared in the title role in Rossini’s opera Semiramide (1832). She continued successful appearances in Paris until 1849. She also began a long career in London, first appearing as Ninetta in Rossini’s La gazza ladra in 1834. In 1835 Bellini wrote I puritani for the great quartet of Grisi, the bass Luigi Lablache, the tenor Giovanni-Battista Rubini, and the baritone Antonio Tamburini. In 1839 the tenor Giovanni Mario (later Grisi’s permanent companion) replaced Rubini, and for them Gaetano Donizetti wrote Don Pasquale. This quartet reigned supreme for about 25 years.
