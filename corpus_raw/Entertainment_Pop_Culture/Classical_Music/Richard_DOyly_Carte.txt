Richard D’Oyly Carte,  (born May 3, 1844, London, Eng.—died  April 3, 1901, London), English impresario remembered for having managed the first productions of operas by Sir W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, for elevating his era’s musical taste, and for contributing to the development of theatre technology.
Originally an aspiring composer, Carte became a music manager, representing the French composer Charles Gounod. After commissioning Gilbert and Sullivan to write Trial by Jury (1875), he formed the Comedy Opera Company Ltd. (1876) for the production of operettas, introducing to England works by Charles Lecocq and Jacques Offenbach. In 1881 Carte founded the Savoy Theatre, home of the immensely popular Gilbert and Sullivan productions and London’s first theatre to use electric lighting. In an attempt to establish serious opera, Carte built the Royal English Opera House (1887; now the Palace Theatre), for which Sullivan wrote Ivanhoe (1891). Despite subsequent commissions to other English composers (including Sir Frederic Hymen Cowen), that enterprise collapsed. After Carte’s death, the touring companies he established, known as the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company, continued to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works into the 21st century.
