Charles Avison,  (baptized Feb. 16, 1709, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, England—died May 9, 1770, Newcastle upon Tyne), English composer, organist, and writer on musical aesthetics.
Little is known of Avison’s life until he took positions as organist at St. John’s and St. Nicholas’ churches in Newcastle in 1736. He also taught harpsichord, violin, and flute and conducted some of the first subscription concerts in England. His “Essay on Musical Expression” (1752) evoked a pamphlet from William Hayes, professor of music at the University of Oxford (1753), to which Avison replied in an enlarged edition of the “Essay.” Avison lived all his life in Newcastle, refusing appointments at York, Dublin, Edinburgh, and London. In 1757 he assisted the composer John Garth in an English edition of Benedetto Marcello’s Psalms. The violinist Francesco Geminiani, who may have been his teacher, visited him in 1760. As a composer, Avison was a representative of the last phase of the late Baroque style. Among his works are compositions for harpsichord and string quartet, and sonatas for harpsichord and two violins. His “Essay” and other writings throw considerable light on 18th-century methods of performance.
