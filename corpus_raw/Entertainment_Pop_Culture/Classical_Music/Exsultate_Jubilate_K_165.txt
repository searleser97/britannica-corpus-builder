Exsultate, Jubilate, K 165, (Latin: “Rejoice, Be Glad”)  three-movement motet (short sacred composition for voice sung with or without an orchestra) written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1773, when the composer was still in his teens. (A revision of the instrumentation and text followed in 1779 or 1780.)
Employed from his earliest years by Count Sigismund von Schrattenbach, the prince-archbishop of Salzburg, young Mozart wrote much sacred music. This particular motet was written on the last of three concert tours to Italy undertaken by Mozart and his father, Leopold. Late in 1772, Mozart was in Milan for the premiere of his new opera Lucio Silla. This work’s leading role was filled by the gifted Italian castrato Venanzio Rauzzini, whose powerful high voice was greatly admired. After hearing Rauzzini’s voice, Mozart wrote Exsultate, Jubilate expressly for him. In modern times the piece has been adopted by female sopranos.
The text, of unknown authorship, is rife with gladness, and Mozart ably captured this joyful mood in his music. The third movement ends with a brilliant and exuberant setting of “Alleluia.”
