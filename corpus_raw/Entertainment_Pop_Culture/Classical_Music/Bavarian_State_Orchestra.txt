Bavarian State Orchestra, German Bayerische Staatsorchester,  German symphony orchestra based in Munich. It originated as the Münchner Kantorei (“Choir of Munich”), an ensemble of singers and instrumentalists gathered by Duke Wilhelm IV’s court composer Ludwig Senfl, beginning in 1523. Under the energetic Orlando di Lasso (1563–94) the group was reorganized, using a variety of western European music and musicians, and its performances made Munich a major musical centre. The operas mounted at court beginning in 1653 renewed Munich’s musical reputation. Another revival of court music resulted from the patronage of elector Maximilian III Joseph (1745–77), himself a musician and composer with cosmopolitan tastes.
Important directors of the court orchestra included Franz Lachner (1836–67) and Hans von Bülow (1866–69), who presented operas of Richard Wagner, including premieres of Tristan and Isolde and Die Meistersinger. Hermann Levi, who directed it in 1872–90, was a highly regarded conductor of the music of Wagner, Johannes Brahms, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Richard Strauss served as its director in 1894–96. After World War I it became the Bavarian State Orchestra. Notable 20th-century conductors included Bruno Walter (1913–18, 1922), Hans Knappertsbusch (1922–33, 1945), Georg Solti (1946–52), and Wolfgang Sawallisch (1971–93). Zubin Mehta led the orchestra through the turn of the 21st century (1998–2006), passing the directorship to Kent Nagano in 2006. Kirill Petrenko succeeded Nagano in 2013.
