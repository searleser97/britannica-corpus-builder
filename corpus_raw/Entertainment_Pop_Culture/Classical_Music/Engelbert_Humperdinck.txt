Engelbert Humperdinck,  (born Sept. 1, 1854, Sieberg, Hanover—died  Sept. 27, 1921, Neustrelitz, Ger.), German composer known for his opera Hänsel und Gretel.
Humperdinck studied at Cologne and at Munich. In 1879 a Mendelssohn scholarship enabled him to go to Italy, where he met Wagner, who invited him to assist in the production of Parsifal at Bayreuth. He taught at the Barcelona Conservatory (1885–87) and at Frankfurt (1890–96), where he was also music critic of the Frankfurter Zeitung. Early works were the choral ballads Die Wallfahrt nach Kevelaar (1878), Das Glück von Edenhall (1884), and the Humoreske (1880) for orchestra. Hänsel und Gretel, conducted by Richard Strauss, was produced at Weimar on Dec. 23, 1893. The libretto, by the composer’s sister Adelheid Wette, was based on the folktale made familiar by the brothers Grimm. In this work Humperdinck showed an understanding of a child’s mind and a sense of poetry, notably in the atmosphere of the woodland scene at twilight and in the realistic effects in the episode of the broken milk jug; the Wagnerian harmonies, the simple tunes, and the resourceful orchestration maintain the musical interest on a high level.
Between 1895 and 1919 Humperdinck produced six more operas, including Dornröschen (Frankfurt, 1902) and Königskinder (New York City, 1910), but neither they nor the spectacle The Miracle (London, 1911) enhanced his prestige. He also wrote incidental music for plays by Aristophanes, Shakespeare, and Maeterlinck; a Moorish Rhapsody for orchestra (1898); a string quartet; works for piano; and songs.
