Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,  Britain’s national symphony orchestra, based in London and founded in 1946 by Sir Thomas Beecham, who was music director until his death in 1961. Toward the end of Beecham’s tenure, Artur Rodzinski, Georges Prêtre, and Rudolf Kempe were actively involved as conductors. Kempe succeeded Beecham as music director (1961–75), and under his leadership Leopold Stokowski, Erich Leinsdorf, and Sir Malcolm Sargent were among the conductors active with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO).
Subsequent music directors of the RPO have included Antal Dorati (1975–78), André Previn (1985–86), Vladimir Ashkenazy (1987–94), and Daniele Gatti  (1996–2009). Charles Dutoit was appointed artistic director and principal conductor in 2009.
From 1946 to 1959, under Beecham, the RPO made more than 250 recordings. Since becoming a self-governing body in 1963, the orchestra has continued to make international tours and to record extensively. In 1986 it became the first symphony orchestra to own a recording company, Royal Philharmonic Records (RPO Records). The Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra (formerly the Royal Philharmonic Pops Orchestra), which performs light classical music, was founded in 1987.
