Robert Jones,  (flourished 1597–1615), songwriter of the school of English lutenists that flourished at the turn of the 17th century.
Little is known about his life except that he received a bachelor of music degree at the University of Oxford in 1597 and that in 1610 he and Philip Rosseter and two others were granted a London patent to train a group of children to be called Children of the Queen’s Revels (see Children of the Chapel). However, the privy council ordered the demolition of the building in which they were to perform. Jones’s works include The First Set of Madrigals (1607), now incomplete, three anthems, and five books of songs for voice and lute (1600–10).
