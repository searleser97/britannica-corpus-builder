Renata Tebaldi,  (born February 1, 1922, Pesaro, Italy—died December 19, 2004, San Marino), Italian operatic soprano, a star at both Milan’s La Scala and New York City’s Metropolitan Opera.
Tebaldi received her early musical training from her mother, a singer, and studied at the Parma Conservatory. At age 18 she sang for Carmen Melis, of the Arrigo Boito Conservatory in Pesaro, who accepted her as a student. She made her debut in Rovigo, Italy, in 1944 as Elena in Arrigo Boito’s Mefistofele. In 1946 Tebaldi auditioned for Arturo Toscanini, who hired her for the reopening concert of La Scala, which had been closed during World War II. She joined the La Scala company in 1949 and sang with them through 1954. She also appeared in Naples at the Teatro San Carlo, in London at Covent Garden, in San Francisco and Chicago, and in New York City at the Metropolitan Opera, of which she was a member after 1954. Tebaldi sang almost exclusively in Italian, and her great roles included Giacomo Puccini’s Mimi (in La Bohème) and Tosca, Giuseppe Verdi’s Desdemona (in Otello) and Aida, and Umberto Giordano’s Madeleine (in Andrea Chénier). Noted for her expressive and alluring voice and commanding stage presence, she was one of the most celebrated opera singers of her era. Tebaldi retired from the stage in 1976.
