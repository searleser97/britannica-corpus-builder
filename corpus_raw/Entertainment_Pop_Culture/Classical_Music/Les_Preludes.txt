Les Préludes,  symphonic, or tone, poem by Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt that premiered in 1854 in Weimar, in the grand duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (now in Germany). It is the best known of Liszt’s 13 symphonic poems and is by turns reflective, martial, and majestic.
Not only was Liszt the greatest piano virtuoso of his time, but his striking looks and charismatic personality made him a popular figure, especially among women. In middle age, however, he was persuaded by his unhappily married mistress, the Polish-born princess Carolyne Sayn-Wittgenstein, to give up his performance career and to devote his attention to composition. He had been appointed director of music at the Weimar court in 1843, and in 1848 he and the princess took up residence in Weimar. There he conducted the court orchestra and wrote orchestral music of his own, including Les Préludes, which he dedicated to Princess Carolyne when he published it in 1856.
Liszt drew the piece’s title from a line by French poet and statesman Alphonse de Lamartine: “What is life but a series of preludes to that unknown hymn whose first solemn note is intoned by death?” The philosophy inherent in those words led generations of critics to draw somewhat misguided parallels between the poem and particular melodies in Liszt’s work. Although Liszt made a conscious decision to cite Lamartine, that text was not his direct inspiration. Liszt’s piece had been written years before it was associated with Lamartine’s words, and it was premiered as an overture to Les Quatres Eléments, a choral setting based on a different source. Liszt reworked the overture and selected Lamartine’s words as more suitable for its program (in the sense of extramusical meaning). Although Liszt undertook some revisions of the score, the piece remained substantially unchanged from its original form.
