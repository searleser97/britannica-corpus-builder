Jacobus Clemens, Clemens also spelled Clement, also called Clemens Non Papa,  (born c. 1510, Ieper, Burgundian Flanders—died c. 1556, Diksmuide, Spanish Netherlands), composer famous for his sacred music, who was a leader in the Flemish, or Netherlands, style that dominated Renaissance music. He called himself Clemens non Papa to avoid confusion with a contemporary priest and poet.
In 1544 he was probationary choirmaster of Saint-Donatien in Brugge (Bruges) and in 1550 was singer and composer at ’s Hertogenbosch. An elegy of 1558 suggests that he died violently. His outstanding Souter Liedekens (1556) was an almost complete series of metrical psalms in Flemish. His other works include 16 masses, more than 200 motets, and 90 chansons. He used simple, impressive themes, melodious lines, and skillful melodic imitation.
