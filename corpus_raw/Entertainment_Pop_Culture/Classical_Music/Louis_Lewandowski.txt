Louis Lewandowski,  (born April 3, 1821, Września, Pol.—died  Feb. 4, 1894, Berlin), Jewish cantor, chorus conductor, and composer of synagogue music.
By the age of 12 Lewandowski was singing with a Berlin choir; he studied violin and piano and was admitted to Berlin University and the Academy of Fine Arts (the first Jew to be admitted). From 1840 he directed music at the Old Synagogue in Berlin, going to the New Synagogue in 1866. He also taught at the Jewish Free School and Jewish Teachers’ Seminary. He was a founder and manager of the Institute for Aged and Indigent Musicians.
Lewandowski’s style amalgamated the traditional liturgical melodies of the Ashkenazim (Yiddish-vernacular Jews) with modern harmonies, often calling for instrumental accompaniment. The solos for cantor remained more or less in the traditional idiom, while the choruses reflected the influence of Felix Mendelssohn and other contemporary composers. The style was less romantic than that of Salomon Sulzer, another major synagogue composer, and became widely popular in Germany and eventually elsewhere. Among his publications are Kol rinha u-tefilla (The Voice of Song and Prayer, 1871), for one and two parts; Toda we-zimra (Thanks and Song, 2 vol., 1876–82), for soloist, choir, and organ; a large number of psalm settings arranged for soloists, choir, and organ; and a number of secular works, including songs, overtures, and symphonies.
