Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 61,  concerto for solo violin and orchestra by Ludwig van Beethoven that is one of the earliest and most frequently performed of violin concerti on such a grand scale. It premiered in Vienna on December 23, 1806. It was Beethoven’s only concerto for violin, and it is considered to be his most lyrical work.
Beethoven wrote his concerto during a three-year period of intense creativity that produced nine large-scale masterworks, including his Triple Concerto and the Razumovsky Quartets. The Violin Concerto was commissioned by violinist Franz Clement, who wanted a dramatic showpiece for an upcoming concert. Beethoven completed the work within a few weeks but only shortly before the concert.
The piece’s first movement, “Allegro ma non troppo,” is written in classic sonata form, including exposition, development, and recapitulation (with coda). The second movement, “Larghetto,” is a group of variations on two themes. The third movement “Rondo: allegro,” is a hybrid form sometimes known as a rondo sonata, which includes elements of both musical forms. It incorporates a cadenza composed later by Austrian-born violinist Fritz Kreisler.
