Giovanni Battista Martini, byname Padre Martini,  (born April 24, 1706, Bologna, Papal States—died  Aug. 3, 1784, Bologna), Italian composer, music theorist, and music historian who was internationally renowned as a teacher.
Martini was educated by his father, a violinist; by Luc’Antonio Predieri (harpsichord, singing, organ); and by Antonio Riccieri (counterpoint). He was ordained in 1729, after becoming chapelmaster of San Francesco in Bologna in 1725. He opened a school of music, and his fame as a teacher made Bologna a place of pilgrimage. Among his pupils were J.C. Bach, Mozart, Christoph Gluck, Niccolò Jommelli, and André Grétry; among his correspondents were the leading men of letters of his time, including Martin Agricola, Pietro Metastasio, Johann Quantz, and Jean-Philippe Rameau.
Martini was a zealous collector of musical literature; his library, estimated at 17,000 volumes by the 18th-century music historian Charles Burney, became the basis for the Civic Museum and Music Library in Bologna. He was a prolific composer of sacred and secular music. His works include the Litaniae (1734), 12 Sonate d’intavolatura (1742), 6 Sonate per l’organo ed il cembalo (1747), Duetti da camera (1763), and masses and oratorios. His most important literary works are the Storia della musica (1757–81; incomplete) and the two-volume Saggio di contrappunto (1774–75).
