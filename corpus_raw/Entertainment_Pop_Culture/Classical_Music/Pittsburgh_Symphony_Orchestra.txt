Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO ),  American symphony orchestra based in Pittsburgh. It was founded as the Pittsburgh Orchestra in 1896; its first conductor was Frederick Archer (1896–98). Music director Victor Herbert (1898–1904) was followed by permanent conductor Emil Paur (1904–10), after which the orchestra was disbanded until 1926, when the newly formed autonomous Pittsburgh Symphony Society presented a concert conducted by Richard Hageman. From 1927 through 1930, the PSO was led by Elias Breeskin, concertmaster and later conductor, and by such guest conductors as Eugene Goossens and Walter Damrosch. Permanent conductor Antonio Modarelli (1930–37) was succeeded by Otto Klemperer (1937–38), who reorganized the membership and revitalized the orchestra. Music directors have been Fritz Reiner (1938–48), William Steinberg (1952–76; emeritus 1976–78), André Previn (1976–84), Lorin Maazel (1988–96; music consultant 1984–88), Mariss Jansons (1995–2004), and Manfred Honeck (2008– ).
From 1936, PSO concerts were broadcast nationwide over radio. During Reiner’s tenure the PSO made its first foreign tour and its first commercial recording. Steinberg continued Reiner’s work of building the PSO into one of the finest orchestras in the United States, expanding its repertoire to include music from the Baroque period through such central European modernists as Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, Anton Webern, and Gustav Mahler. Under Previn and Maazel the PSO made international tours and championed English, Russian, and late 20th-century music. From the 1960s the orchestra made successful tours of Europe, Asia, and South America. The PSO offered community outreach programs, children’s concerts, and great-performers series. From 1995 to 2012 Marvin Hamlisch served as the first principal conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Pops.
