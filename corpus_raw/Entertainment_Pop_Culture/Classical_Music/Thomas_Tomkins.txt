Thomas Tomkins,  (born 1572, St. Davids, Pembrokeshire, Wales—buried June 9, 1656, Martin Hussingtree, Worcester, Eng.), English composer and organist, the most important member of a family of musicians that flourished in England in the 16th and 17th centuries.
A pupil of William Byrd, he served as organist of Worcester cathedral (1596–1646), and in 1621 he became one of the organists of the Chapel Royal. Tomkins was an extremely prolific composer of anthems and services for the church, and his best madrigals rank among the finest produced by the English madrigal school. His keyboard music includes pieces in free fugal forms, variation sets, and dances. He also wrote fine consort music for viols.
