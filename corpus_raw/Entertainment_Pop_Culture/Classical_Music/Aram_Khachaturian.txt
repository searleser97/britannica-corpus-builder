Aram Khachaturian, in full Aram Ilich Khachaturian,  (born May 24 [June 6, New Style], 1903, Tiflis, Georgia, Russian Empire [now Tbilisi, Georgia]—died May 1, 1978, Moscow), Soviet composer best known for his Piano Concerto (1936) and his ballet Gayane (1942), which includes the popular, rhythmically stirring Sabre Dance.
Khachaturian was trained at the Gnesin State Musical and Pedagogical Institute in Moscow and at the Moscow Conservatory and was a professor at both schools from 1951. As a young composer, he was influenced by contemporary Western music, particularly that of Maurice Ravel. In his Symphony No. 1 (1935) and later works, this influence was supplanted by a growing appreciation of folk traditions, not only those of his Armenian forebears but also those of Georgia, Russia, Turkey, and Azerbaijan. His  Symphony No. 2 (1943) was written for the 25th anniversary of the Russian Revolution. His other works include a symphonic suite, Masquerade (1944; from incidental music to a play by Mikhail Lermontov); the ballets Happiness (1939) and Spartak (1953; “Spartacus”); a Third Symphony; a violin concerto (1940); a cello concerto (1946); and numerous shorter works. He also composed the music for the Armenian national anthem, as well as film scores and incidental music.
In 1948, along with Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergey Prokofiev, Khachaturian was accused by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of bourgeois tendencies in his music. He admitted his guilt and was restored to prominence. After Stalin’s death in 1953, however, he publicly condemned the Central Committee’s accusation, which was formally rescinded in 1958. He was named People’s Artist of the Soviet Union in 1954 and was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1959.
Khachaturian’s family was prominent in Soviet cultural affairs; his wife, Nina Makarova, and his nephew, Karen Khachaturian, were also composers.
