Orlando Gibbons,  (born 1583, Oxford, Oxfordshire, Eng.—died  June 5, 1625, Canterbury, Kent), organist and composer, one of the last great figures of the English polyphonic school.
Gibbons was the most illustrious of a large family of musicians that included his father, William Gibbons (c. 1540–95), and two of his brothers, Edward and Ellis. From 1596 to 1599 Orlando Gibbons sang in the King’s College Choir; he entered the University of Cambridge in 1598. In 1603 he became a member of the Chapel Royal and later became the chapel’s organist, a post that he retained for the remainder of his life. In 1619 he was appointed one of the “musicians for the virginalles to attend in his highnes privie chamber,” and in 1622 he was made honorary doctor of music of the University of Oxford. The following year he became organist at Westminster Abbey, where he later officiated at the funeral service of King James I. Gibbons was part of the retinue attending Charles I when the king traveled to Dover to meet his bride, Henrietta Maria, but he died shortly before her arrival from France.
Gibbons’s full anthems are among his most distinguished works, as are the “little” anthems of four parts. His Madrigals and Motetts of 5 Parts was published in 1612. This collection contains deeply felt and very personal settings of texts that are, for the most part, of a moral or philosophical nature. It shows Gibbons’s mastery of the polyphonic idiom of his day and contains many masterpieces of late madrigalist style, among them the well-known “The Silver Swan” and “What Is Our Life?” The earlier Fantasies in Three Parts Compos’d for Viols (c. 1610) is believed to have been the first music printed in England from engraved copperplates.
Gibbons was famous as a keyboard player, and toward the end of his life he was said to be without rival in England as an organist and virginalist. Several of his virginal pieces were published in Parthenia (c. 1612), and more than 40 others survive in manuscript.
