John Jenkins,  (born 1592, Maidstone, Kent, Eng.—died  Oct. 27, 1678, Kimberley, Norfolk), composer, lutenist, and string player, most eminent composer in his era of music for chamber ensembles. He was musician to Charles I and Charles II and served patrons from the nobility and gentry, notably Sir Hamon L’Estrange and Lord North, whose son refers to Jenkins in his writings. His last patron was Sir Philip Wodehouse of Kimberley.
Jenkins’s string fantasias, or fancies, for which he was renowned, reflect the stylistic change that took place in this form during his lifetime. The earlier five-part viol fantasias are largely polyphonic, showing the influence of the earlier ricercar and canzone. His later three-part fantasias for two violins and bass are multisectional, employ homophonic passages, and illustrate the influence of the trio sonata and of Italian fashions on form and figuration. His compositions also include rounds, songs, and anthems.
