NBC Symphony, also called (1954–63) Symphony Of The Air,   American orchestra created in 1937 by the National Broadcasting Company expressly for the internationally renowned conductor Arturo Toscanini. Based in New York City, the orchestra gave weekly concerts that were broadcast worldwide over NBC radio. Often billed as the Toscanini Orchestra, the NBC Symphony was known for its high level of musicianship and its recordings, as well as for Toscanini’s artistic supremacy and fiery temperament. Leopold Stokowski served as co-conductor (1941–44). Toscanini retired after the final concert on April 4, 1954; the National Broadcasting Company then severed any connection with the NBC Symphony.
Renamed the Symphony of the Air, the orchestra retained many members of the NBC Symphony. It was re-formed as an ensemble without a conductor; later in 1954, at its first full-length concert, it was led only by a nod from the concertmaster. The Symphony of the Air was determined to become a viable orchestral entity; it raised funds by producing two recordings of its initial concert and by subsequent concert performances. Private contributions provided its support. On its artistically successful national and international concert tours, it was led by such conductors as Stokowski, Leonard Bernstein, Sir Thomas Beecham, Fritz Reiner, Bruno Walter, and Pierre Monteux. Jerome Toobin was administrative director of the orchestra from 1955 until 1963, when the Symphony of the Air disbanded.
