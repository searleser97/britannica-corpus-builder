Frank Bridge,  (born Feb. 26, 1879, Brighton, Sussex, Eng.â€”died  Jan. 10, 1941, Eastbourne, Sussex), English composer, viola player, and conductor, one of the most accomplished musicians of his day, known especially for his chamber music and songs.
Bridge studied violin at the Royal College of Music, London, but changed to viola, becoming a virtuoso player. After a period in the Joachim Quartet (1906) he played with the English String Quartet until 1915. He also held various positions as a conductor, both symphonic and operatic.
Although he composed in many genres, he was particularly successful in his smaller forms, such as the Phantasie Quartet for piano and strings (1910), four string quartets, and songs and piano pieces. His early works were Romantic in style; later, while he never abandoned Romanticism, he moved toward atonality. He was widely respected as a teacher, and his pupils included Benjamin Britten.
