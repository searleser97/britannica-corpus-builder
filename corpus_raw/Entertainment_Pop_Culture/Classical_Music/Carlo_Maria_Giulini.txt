Carlo Maria Giulini,  (born May 9, 1914, Barletta, Italy—died June 14, 2005, Brescia), Italian conductor esteemed for his skills in directing both grand opera and symphony orchestras.
Giulini studied under Bernardino Molinari at Rome’s Accademia di Santa Cecilia (later Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia). As violist for that institution’s resident orchestra, he observed the work of such notables as Wilhelm Furtwängler, Otto Klemperer, and Bruno Walter. His conducting debut took place there in 1944; that same year he was appointed musical director for Italian Radio. In 1950 he organized the Milan Radio Orchestra, whose broadcasts brought him to the attention of Arturo Toscanini and Victor de Sabata. Three years later he succeeded Sabata as principal conductor of La Scala, where he worked with producer Franco Zeffirelli and such performers as Maria Callas. Acclaimed performances of Italian opera at a series of European festivals were followed by successes in Britain in 1955 at the Edinburgh Festival and in London in 1958 during the centenary of the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden. In 1967 Giulini, who had left La Scala in 1955, decided to devote his time to conducting symphony orchestras. He maintained a long association with the London Philharmonia and the Chicago Symphony orchestras. From 1973 to 1976 he conducted the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and in 1978 succeeded Zubin Mehta as chief conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, a post he held until 1984.
Giulini’s conducting style was often compared to that of Toscanini. A Romantic conductor, he performed few modern works and was best known for his interpretations of the music of Giuseppe Verdi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Gustav Mahler, and Anton Bruckner. He also recorded extensively.
