Christoph Graupner,  (born Jan. 13, 1683, Kirchberg, Saxonyâ€”died  May 10, 1760, Darmstadt, Hesse-Darmstadt), one of the principal German composers of the period of Bach and Telemann.
Graupner studied at the Thomasschule in Leipzig. In 1706, because of a threat of Swedish invasion, he sought refuge at Hamburg, where he was harpsichordist at the opera under R. Keiser. About 1710 he entered the service of the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, becoming chapelmaster in 1712. In 1722 he was offered the cantorship of St. Thomas in Leipzig, but he declined the post and it passed to J.S. Bach.
The most significant genres in which Graupner worked were the chorale cantata, the trio sonata, and the concerto. He composed about 1,300 cantatas. In style they approach the gallant, or Rococo, style, that was emerging at that time. His trio sonatas and concerti represent a German assimilation of these Italian forms. Characteristically, the trio sonatas are written in fugal style. Graupner also wrote several operas, many overtures and symphonies, and harpsichord partitas and sonatas.
