Valentin Alkan, in full Charles-Henri-Valentin Alkan, original name Charles-Henri-Valentin Morhange,  (born Nov. 30, 1813, Paris, France—died  March 29, 1888, Paris), French pianist-composer, a notable keyboard virtuoso, and one of the most enigmatic figures in 19th-century music.
Alkan was born to Jewish parents, and all of his siblings (five brothers and a sister) were musicians who assumed the surname Alkan. Valentin drew notice at age seven, when he won the first of many first prizes at the Paris Conservatory, and by 17 he had established a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. As a young man he moved in a circle of friends that included George Sand, Victor Hugo, Frédéric Chopin, and Franz Liszt, but for long periods of time beginning in his 20s he withdrew from society and concert performance and devoted himself to composing music. His music, difficult and often unorthodox, displays considerable ingenuity and imagination in advancing the possibilities of keyboard technique; in this respect Ferruccio Busoni, an Italian composer and pianist, considered him to be excelled only by Liszt and Johannes Brahms. Alkan himself felt that he was overshadowed by Liszt. In his rare concert appearances he preferred to play the works of 18th-century composers (then out of fashion), rather than his own compositions. His numerous works (many composed for the distinctive pedal piano) include preludes and studies in all the major and minor keys; 12 pieces, Les Mois (1872; “The Months”); Grande sonate: les quatre âges (1848; “The Four Ages”); and 2 piano concerti. César Franck transcribed several of Alkan’s pieces for organ.
