John Marsh,  (born 1752, Dorking, Surrey, Eng.—died  1828, Chichester, Sussex), composer and writer on music whose works include the only surviving English symphonies from the late 18th century. Largely self-taught, he became proficient at several instruments, including viola and violin. In 1768 he was apprenticed to a solicitor. He played violin in the amateur orchestra at Salisbury, becoming leader of a subscription series there in 1780. In 1783, two years after he inherited an estate near Canterbury, he became leader of the subscription concert orchestra there. In 1787 he moved to Chichester, where he directed subscription concerts and substituted at times for the cathedral organist. His chamber music and symphonies are admired for their melodic charm and skilled scoring. His writings include an essay on “ancient” and modern music, Hints to Young Composers, and an autobiography in manuscript.
