Peter Warlock, byname of Philip Heseltine,  (born Oct. 30, 1894, London—died  Dec. 17, 1930, London), English composer, critic, and editor known for his songs and for his exemplary editions of Elizabethan music. He used his real name chiefly for his literary and editorial work, reserving his assumed name for his musical works.
Warlock was largely self-taught but received encouragement from the composers Frederick Delius and Bernard van Dieren. In 1920 he founded the musical journal The Sackbut. His books include Frederick Delius (1923) and Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa, Musician and Murderer (1926; with C. Gray). He also published monographs on Thomas Whythorne and on the English ayre. He transcribed and edited the compositions of John Dowland, Thomas Ravenscroft, Henry Purcell, and others. His music shows the influence of Elizabethan music, of Delius, and (especially in counterpoint) of van Dieren, all incorporated into a highly personal idiom. His songs, which form the largest part of his compositions, are admired for their unity of music and text, melodic qualities, and unique harmonies. They include the song cycles Lilligay (1923), The Curlew (1924), and Candlelight (1924). Other compositions are the Capriol Suite for strings (1927) on tunes from T. Arbeau’s Orchésographie (1589), Folksong Preludes for piano (1918), and choral works. He died by suicide.
