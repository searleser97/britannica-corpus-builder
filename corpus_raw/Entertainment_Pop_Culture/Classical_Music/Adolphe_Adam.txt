Adolphe Adam, in full Adolphe-Charles Adam,  (born July 24, 1803, Paris, France—died  May 3, 1856, Paris), French composer whose music for the ballet Giselle (1841) is noted for its easy grace and cogency. It has retained its popularity with dancers and audiences to the present day.
Adam wrote more than 70operas, of which the most popular in their day were Le Châlet (1834), Le Postillon de Longjumeau (1836), and Giralda (1850). In his ballets—which he composed for production in London, Berlin, and St. Petersburg, as well as Paris—he skillfully coordinated the music with choreographic demands. His works were successful during the mid-19th century, but few, other than Giselle, are regularly revived.
