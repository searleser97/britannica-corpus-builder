Victor Herbert,   (born Feb. 1, 1859, Dublin, Ire.—died  May 26, 1924, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Irish-born American composer of operettas and light music.
Herbert became active in Germany as a composer and cello virtuoso (studying with Max Seifritz and Bernhard Cossmann, respectively). In 1886 he went to the United States with his wife, Therese Förster, who became a prima donna in the Metropolitan Opera. He played in the Metropolitan Orchestra and under Anton Seidl and Theodore Thomas. His early compositions, romantic and melodious, were performed by the New York Philharmonic Society; he was soloist in his two cello concerti. In 1893 he assumed leadership of the celebrated 22nd Regiment Band (formerly P.S. Gilmore’s); from 1898 to 1904 he conducted the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra; and in 1904 he organized his own concert orchestra. He led the fight for favourable copyright legislation, passed in 1909, and he helped found the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1914.
Herbert’s first operetta was Prince Ananias (1894). It was followed by more than 40 others. Among the best are The Serenade (1897), The Fortune Teller (1898), Babes in Toyland (1903), Mlle. Modiste (1905), The Red Mill (1906), Naughty Marietta (1910), Sweethearts (1913), The Only Girl (1914), and Eileen, first performed as Hearts of Erin (1917). His operetta music was superbly orchestrated. He also wrote two grand operas, Natoma (1911) and Madeleine (1914), and the music for the motion picture The Fall of a Nation (1916), probably the first original symphonic score composed for a feature film. Late in life he wrote for revues, notably the Ziegfeld Follies.
