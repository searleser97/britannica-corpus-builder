Morton Gould,  (born Dec. 10, 1913, Richmond Hill, N.Y., U.S.â€”died  Feb. 21, 1996, Orlando, Fla.), American composer, conductor, and pianist noted for his synthesis of popular idioms with traditional forms of composition and orchestration.
Gould studied piano with Abby Whiteside and composition with Vincent Jones at the New York Institute of Musical Art. After working as a radio accompanist, he arranged and conducted a series of radio programs devoted to the more popular classical literature, and thereafter he composed and conducted for films, television, the theatre, and recordings. He became a popular guest conductor with many major American symphony orchestras. His compositions often utilize American themes and include musical comedies, ballets, numerous orchestral works, and some pieces for piano. Among his more notable works are the Latin-American Symphonette (1941), Lincoln Legend (1942), Interplay (1945), the score of the Broadway musical Billion Dollar Baby (1945), and the Fall River Legend ballet score (1948).
