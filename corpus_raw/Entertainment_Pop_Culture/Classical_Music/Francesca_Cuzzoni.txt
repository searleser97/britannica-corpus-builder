Francesca Cuzzoni,  (born c. 1698, Parma, duchy of Parma [Italy]—died  1770, Bologna, Papal States), Italian soprano, one of the first great prima donnas.
Cuzzoni studied with Francesco Lanzi and appeared first in Parma in 1716. She made her debut in Venice in 1718 as Dalinda in Carlo Francesco Pollarolo’s Ariodante and in London in 1723 as Teofane in George Frideric Handel’s Ottone, performed by his opera company. There she subsequently achieved prominence and was at her best in the many Handel roles written for her, as Cleopatra, Asteria, Rodelinda, and Antigona.
The enthusiasm of Cuzzoni’s devotees in London led to public disputes, however, first with followers of Francesco Senesino and later with those of Faustina Bordoni. The notoriety of her rivalry with Bordoni obscured her considerable accomplishments, but she performed in many more operas in Italy between 1730 and 1738, including Johann Adolf Hasse’s Ezio and Euristeo, Nicola Antonio Porpora’s Arianna in Nasso, Leonardo Leo’s Olimpiade, and Antonio Caldara’s Ormisda. In 1750 she returned to London to give a benefit concert and the next year, beset by debts, made a final appearance there. Her fortunes continued to decline, and she died in poverty.
