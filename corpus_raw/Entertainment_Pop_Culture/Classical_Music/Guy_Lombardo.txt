Guy Lombardo, in full Guy Albert Lombardo,  (born June 19, 1902, London, Ont., Can.—died Nov. 5, 1977, Houston, Texas, U.S.), Canadian-born American dance-band leader whose New Year’s Eve radio and television broadcasts with his Royal Canadians became an American tradition for 48 years. Derided by some music critics as the “king of corn,” Lombardo gained long-lasting popularity by conducting what was billed as “the sweetest music this side of heaven.” With his brother Carmen playing lead saxophone, his band introduced more than 300 songs and sold more than 250 million recordings.
Guy Lombardo was the eldest son of musically inclined parents and trained as a violinist. His career was launched through an engagement in Cleveland that led to his being represented by the then-fledgling Music Corporation of America (MCA). He first broadcast nationally from Chicago in 1927, and by 1929 he was the winter attraction at New York City’s Roosevelt Grill, a booking repeated for more than 30 years. After the Grill closed, Lombardo moved to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, continuing the televised New Year’s Eve broadcasts, begun in 1954, that climaxed with the playing of “Auld Lang Syne.” He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1937.
Beginning as a nonet, the Royal Canadians numbered 16 by 1968. Long tenure was common in the orchestra. Dewey Bergman was Lombardo’s arranger from the orchestra’s inception in London, Ont., in 1923 until he died in 1971. Guy’s and Carmen’s siblings Lebert (lead trumpeter), Rose Marie, and Victor and their brother-in-law Ken Garner were all band members.
