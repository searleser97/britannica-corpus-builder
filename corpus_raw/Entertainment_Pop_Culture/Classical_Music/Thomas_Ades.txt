Thomas Adès, in full Thomas Joseph Edmund Adès,  (born March 1, 1971, London, England), British composer, pianist, and conductor whose diverse compositional oeuvre, ranging from solo pieces to operas, established him as one of the most-skilled classical music artists of his generation.
Trained as a pianist at the Guildhall School in London, Adès later attended King’s College, Cambridge. Initial recognition came for his virtuoso piano playing, but he started to write music in 1990 (Five Eliot Landscapes) and was instantly acclaimed as a major composer for his inventiveness and remarkably assured technique. Among his notable early compositions are Living Toys (1993), for chamber ensemble, and Arcadiana (1994), for string quartet. His controversial opera Powder Her Face (1995), about a 20th-century divorce scandal, attracted international attention, as did his large symphonic work Asyla (1997).
Adès’s works from the early 21st century included The Tempest (2003), an opera inspired by William Shakespeare’s play, and In Seven Days (2008), an orchestral piece accompanied by video images. As a pianist, he appeared on several recordings, including the solo release Piano (2000). His orchestral works from the 2010s comprised Polaris (2011); Totentanz (2013), inspired by a frieze painted by 15th-century German sculptor Bernt Notke; and Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (2019). Adès’s third opera, The Exterminating Angel, based on Luis Buñuel’s 1962 film of the same name, premiered at the 2016 Salzburg Festival, Austria. During the decade he also gave solo piano recitals at Carnegie Hall (2010), New York, and Wigmore Hall (2018), London.
Adès was appointed artistic partner of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 2016. He also regularly conducted, among others, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra; the London Symphony Orchestra; the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam; the Gewandhaus Orchestra, Leipzig, Germany; and the Czech Philharmonic, Prague. He was nominated for a number of Grammy Awards, winning best opera recording for The Tempest in 2014.
