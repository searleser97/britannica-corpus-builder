Stanford Moore,  (born Sept. 4, 1913, Chicago, Ill., U.S.â€”died  Aug. 23, 1982, New York, N.Y.), American biochemist, who, with Christian B. Anfinsen and William H. Stein, received the 1972 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for their research on the molecular structures of proteins.
Moore received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1938 and joined the staff of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now Rockefeller University) in New York City in 1939, attaining the rank of professor in 1952.
Working together at the Rockefeller Institute, Moore and Stein pioneered new methods of chromatography for use in analyzing amino acids and small peptides obtained by the hydrolysis of proteins. In 1958 they helped develop the first automatic amino-acid analyzer, a machine that greatly facilitated the analysis of the amino acid sequences of proteins. In 1959 Moore and Stein used the new machine to make the first determination of the complete chemical structure of an enzyme, ribonuclease.
