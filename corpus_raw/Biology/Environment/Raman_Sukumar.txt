Raman Sukumar,  (born April 3, 1955, Madras [now Chennai], India), Indian ecologist best known for his work on the behaviour of Asian elephants and how their presence has affected both human and natural environments.
As a child growing up in Madras, Sukumar was dubbed vanavasi (the Tamil word for “forest dweller”) by his grandmother. It was during his secondary-school years that Sukumar first developed an interest in the field of conservation. He graduated from the University of Madras with bachelor’s (1977) and master’s (1979) degrees in botany. In 1979 he began studies for his doctoral thesis at the Indian Institute of Science, where he focused on the ecological conflict that occurs when elephants and humans use the same land. He received his doctorate in ecology in 1985 and became a professor at the Centre for Ecological Sciences, attached to the Indian Institute of Science, in 1986. Sukumar later became a Fulbright scholar and completed a postdoctoral fellowship (1991–92) at Princeton University.
In an effort to provide a safe habitat for elephants, Sukumar carried out surveys and tried to establish protected corridors so that elephant herds could move from one reserve to another. He experimented with various forms of fences around village perimeters to keep the animals away from crops and human habitation. Sukumar also helped design the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, the first of its kind in India, which was established in 1986. There he conducted research on climate change, tropical forests, and wildlife conservation.
In 1993 Sukumar became a member of the Project Elephant Steering Committee, which provided technical support and advice on matters of elephant conservation to the Indian government. He chaired the Asian Elephant Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union from 1997 to 2004. Sukumar also served as director of the Asian Elephant Research and Conservation Centre, a special division of the Asian Nature Conservation Foundation, an independent organization that he had helped to establish in 1997. The foundation worked closely with many governmental and nongovernmental agencies in the region to determine how to best conserve elephant habitat and manage human-elephant conflict. He published several notable texts on elephants, including Elephant Days and Nights: Ten Years with the Indian Elephant (1994), The Living Elephants: Evolutionary Ecology, Behavior and Conservation (2003), and The Story of Asia’s Elephants (2011).
Sukumar’s accolades included the Presidential Award of the Chicago Zoological Society in 1989 and the Order of the Golden Ark in 1997. He became a fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences in 2000 and was inducted into the Indian National Science Academy in 2004. Sukumar was presented with the Whitley Gold Award in 2003 and with the International Cosmos Prize in 2006.
