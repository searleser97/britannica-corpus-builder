Mycorrhiza, also spelled Mycorhiza,  an intimate association between the branched, tubular filaments (hyphae) of a fungus (kingdom Fungi) and the roots of higher plants. The association is usually of mutual benefit (symbiotic): a delicate balance between host plant and symbiont results in enhanced nutritional support for each member. The establishment and growth of certain plants (e.g., citrus, orchids, pines) is dependent on mycorrhiza; other plants survive but do not flourish without their fungal symbionts. The two main types of mycorrhiza are endotrophic, in which the fungus invades the hostsâ€™ roots (e.g., orchids), and ectotrophic, in which the fungus forms a mantle around the smaller roots (e.g., pines). Exploitation of these natural associations can benefit forestry, horticulture, and other plant industries.
