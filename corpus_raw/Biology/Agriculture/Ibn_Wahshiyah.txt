Ibn Waḥshīyah,  (flourished c. 900), Middle Eastern agriculturist and toxicologist alleged to have written al-Fillāḥah an-Nabaṭīyah (“Nabatean Agriculture”), a major treatise dealing with plants, water sources and quality, weather conditions, the causes of deforestation, soils and their improvement, crop cultivation, and other similar subjects. The Arabic text, although not original, having been derived mainly from Greek sources, especially from the Geoponics, became a basic resource for later treatments such as that by the Muslim agriculturalist, Ibn al-‘Awwām, who flourished in the second half of the 12th century.
