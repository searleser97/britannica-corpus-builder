C. Lloyd Morgan,  (born Feb. 6, 1852, London—died  March 6, 1936, Hastings, Sussex, Eng.), British zoologist and psychologist, sometimes called the founder of comparative, or animal, psychology.
Educated at the School of Mines with the intention of earning a living as a mining engineer, Morgan was diverted into biology by a chance meeting with Thomas Huxley, who urged him to become one of his students at the Royal College of Science. After a tour of North and South America as a tutor, Morgan did study with Huxley. After then teaching physical sciences at the Diocesan College at Rondebosch, S.Af. (1878–84), Morgan accepted the chair of geology and zoology at University College, Bristol, where he remained for the rest of his professional career. He became principal of the college in 1887 and vice chancellor of the university in 1910 but returned to teaching (1911–19) as professor of psychology and ethics.
In his studies of animal psychology over the years, Morgan attempted to describe animal behaviour in objective terms and without anthropomorphisms. He studied animal behaviour for its own sake, without regard to the mental evolution of man, and applied what has come to be called the principle of parsimony: in Morgan’s words (An Introduction to Comparative Psychology, 1894), “In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale.”
In later years, especially after retirement from Bristol, Morgan turned more to metaphysical or philosophical questions, as reflected especially in Emergent Evolution (1923) and Life, Mind and Spirit (1926).
