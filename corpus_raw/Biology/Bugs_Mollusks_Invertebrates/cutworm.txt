Cutworm,  Larva of certain species of owlet moths (family Noctuidae). The cutworm (not a true worm) is a serious insect pest of tobacco and other crops. Some species attack such plants as corn, grasses, tomatoes, and beans at night, severing roots and stems near ground level. Other species live underground and feed on plant roots.
