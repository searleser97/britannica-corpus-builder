Processionary caterpillar,   larval stage characteristic of the small insect family Thaumetopoeidae (order Lepidoptera), sometimes classified as part of the prominent moth family (Notodontidae). These hairy caterpillars live in communal webs and march in columns to their food source. During the movement each larva lays down a silken thread. The large adults have dull-coloured wings and lack a proboscis (feeding organ). Females of both species possess an abdominal hair tuft, which is used to cover the egg masses.
