Otto Heinrich Schindewolf,  (born June 7, 1896, Hanover, Ger.—died  June 10, 1971, Tübingen, W.Ger.), German paleontologist, known for his research on corals and cephalopods. Schindewolf was a faculty member of the University of Marburg from 1919 until 1927, when he became director of the Geological Survey of Berlin; in 1948 he became a professor at the University of Tübingen, where he retired as professor emeritus in 1964.
Schindewolf’s research on invertebrate fossils led him to question whether the modern theory of evolution, which includes the study of how population genetics may account for change within a given species, could always be applied to the origin of types; he doubted in particular whether the theory could explain the origin of the higher taxonomic categories, such as families, orders, and classes. Studying different fossil species of coral and ammonites obtained from sequential geological strata, he concluded that the most recent taxonomic categories could not have arisen by slow, intermediate steps, generally thought to characterize evolution, but rather by large, single transformations. He drew attention, for example, to the ammonites, in which the anatomical chambers that were successively occupied by the animal preserve the details of both its development and its evolution. The genetic changes responsible for these structural characteristics would have occurred in a single generation and at an early stage of the embryo, he argued; in the following generations the structure would persist through successively later stages of the individual until it became firmly established even in the adult form. Though his views are not accepted by many biologists, particularly the population geneticists, who consider them too controversial, he has drawn attention to fundamental problems in evolution.
Schindewolf wrote Grundfragen der Paläontologie (1950; “Basic Questions of Paleontology”), Grundlagen und Methoden der paläontologischen Chronologie (3rd ed., 1950; “Foundations and Methods of Paleontological Chronology”), and Studien zur Stammesgeschichte der Ammoniten (1961–68; “Studies on the Phylogeny of Ammonites”).
