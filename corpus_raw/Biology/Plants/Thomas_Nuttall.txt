Thomas Nuttall,  (born Jan. 5, 1786, Long Preston, near Settle, Yorkshire, Eng.â€”died  Sept. 10, 1859, Nut Grove Hall, near St. Helens, Lancashire), English naturalist and botanist known for his discoveries of North American plants.
Nuttall grew up in Blackburn, Lancashire, and worked as a journeyman printer for his uncle before he left England for the United States at the age of 22 (in 1808). He settled in Philadelphia, where he became a good friend of the botanist Benjamin S. Barton, who instructed him in general principles of botany and encouraged his scientific career. Nuttall supplemented this help with his own studies and, thus prepared, made numerous trips to North Carolina, Virginia, Missouri, and Arkansas, collecting and identifying species of plants. These trips provided the information for his principal work, The Genera of North American Plants (1818).
In 1822 Nuttall became lecturer on natural history at Harvard University, where he began a study of ornithology. The first volume of his Manual of the Ornithology of the United States and of Canada appeared in 1832 (with further editions in 1840, 1891, 1896, and 1903) and was the first work of moderate size and price on American birds. He resigned from Harvard to accompany an expedition to the Columbia River and Hawaii, where he also collected plants. In 1842 he returned to England. He spent the rest of his life there as a farmer and horticulturist.
