Michel Adanson,  (born April 7, 1727, Aix-en-Provence, Fr.—died  Aug. 3, 1806, Paris), French botanist who devised a natural system of classification and nomenclature of plants, based on all their physical characteristics, with an emphasis on families.
In 1749 Adanson left for Senegal to spend four years as an employee with the Compagnie des Indes, a trading company. He returned with a large collection of plant specimens, some of which became part of the French royal collection under the supervision of the naturalist Georges Buffon; most of them now belong to the National Museum of Natural History in Paris. He published Histoire naturelle du Sénégal (1757), describing the flora of Senegal, and a survey of mollusks.
Adanson’s Familles des plantes (1763) described his classification system for plants, which was much opposed by Carolus Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist who had proposed his own classification system based on the reproductive organs of plants. Adanson’s classification of mollusks, a group that he originally described, was based on anatomical characters. Adanson also introduced the use of statistical methods in botanical classification and studied electricity in torpedo fish and regeneration of limbs and heads in frogs and snails. Although Adanson was well known to European scientists, his system of classification was not widely successful, and it was superseded by the Linnaean system.
