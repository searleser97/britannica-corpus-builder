Nehemiah Grew,  (baptized Sept. 26, 1641, Mancetter Parish, Warwickshire, Eng.—died March 25, 1712, London), English botanist, physician, and microscopist, who, with the Italian microscopist Marcello Malpighi, is considered to be among the founders of the science of plant anatomy. Grew’s first book on plant anatomy, The Anatomy of Vegetables Begun (1672), was presented to the Royal Society of London at the same time as Malpighi’s manuscript on the subject.
Grew received his B.A. from Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, in 1661 and his M.D. from the University of Leyden, in the Netherlands, in 1671. He first practiced medicine in Coventry, Warwickshire, but later moved to London. His training in animal anatomy led to his interest in the anatomy of plants. His Anatomy of Vegetables Begun included much detail of the structure of bean seeds. It noted the existence of cells and created many terms: radicle for the embryonic root; plume for what is now known as the plumule, or primary bud of a plant embryo; and parenchyma for unspecialized cells.
Grew’s best and most popular work, The Anatomy of Plants (1682), includes a section on the anatomy of flowers and many excellent wood engravings that represent the three-dimensional, microscopic structure of plant tissue. The book is best remembered for the idea, suggested to Grew by the physician Sir Thomas Millington, that the stamen, with its pollen, is the male sex organ and that the pistil corresponds to the sex organ of the female.
