Bark,   in woody plants, tissues external to the vascular cambium (the growth layer of the vascular cylinder); the term bark is also employed more popularly to refer to all tissues outside the wood. The inner soft bark, or bast, is produced by the vascular cambium; it consists of secondary phloem tissue whose innermost layer conveys food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. The outer bark, which is mostly dead tissue, is the product of the cork cambium (phellogen). Layered outer bark, containing cork and old, dead phloem, is known as rhytidome. The dead cork cells are lined with suberin, a fatty substance that makes them highly impermeable to gases and water. Gas exchange between the inner tissues of bark-covered roots and stems and their surroundings takes place through spongy areas (lenticels) in the cork.
Bark is usually thinner than the woody part of the stem or root. Both inner bark (secondary phloem) and wood (secondary xylem) are generated by the vascular cambium layer of cells: bark toward the outside where the oldest layers may slough off, and wood toward the inside where it accumulates as dead tissue.
