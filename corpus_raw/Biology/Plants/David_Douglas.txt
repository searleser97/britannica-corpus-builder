David Douglas,  (born 1798, Scone, Perthshire, Scot.â€”died  July 12, 1834, Sandwich [Hawaiian] Islands), Scottish botanist who was a traveller and botanical collector in North America and for whom the Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii, or P. douglasii) and the primrose genus Douglasia are named.
After serving as a gardener at the Botanical Garden at Glasgow, Douglas went to the U.S. as a botanical collector for the Royal Horticultural Society. His first trip was to the Oregon Territory in 1823; he later made several other scientific journeys, especially to the North American Far West. In 1825 he went to British Columbia and travelled inland to Hudson Bay, which he reached in 1827; he discovered many new animal and plant species along the way, including the Douglas fir. From 1830 to 1834 he explored California and the Fraser River region. He introduced some 50 new trees and shrubs and about 100 herbaceous plants into England during his career.
