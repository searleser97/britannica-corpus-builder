Antoine de Jussieu,  (born July 6, 1686, Lyon—died  April 12, 1758, Paris), French physician and botanist who wrote many papers on human anatomy, zoology, and botany, including one on the flower and fruit of the coffee shrub.
After studying medicine at the University of Montpellier, he travelled through Spain, Portugal, and southern France, making a large collection of plants. In 1708 he went to Paris, where he became director of the Jardin du Roi. His edition of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort’s Institutiones Rei Herbariae, 3 vol. (1719; “Elements of Botany”) won him election to the French Académie des Sciences. Antoine was a brother of Bernard and Joseph.
