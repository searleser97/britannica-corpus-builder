Gottlieb Haberlandt,  (born Nov. 28, 1854, Ungarisch-Altenburg, Hung.—died  Jan. 30, 1945, Berlin, Ger.), Austrian botanist, pioneer in the development of physiological plant anatomy, and the first person to study plant tissue culture (1921).
Haberlandt’s first botanical paper appeared in 1874, one year after he entered the University of Vienna, where he obtained his Ph.D. (1876). He went to the University of Tübingen (1877) to study under Simon Schwendener, who subsequently influenced Haberlandt’s belief that structure and function should be studied together. He returned to Austria in 1880 to teach botany at the Technical Academy in Graz. In 1910 Haberlandt succeeded Schwendener in the chair of plant physiology at the University of Berlin, where he established the Institute for Plant Study.
Haberlandt decided that his students would profit from a system of classifying plants based on function. In his book Physiologische Pflanzenanatomie (1884; “Physiological Plant Anatomy”) he distinguished 12 tissue systems based on function (mechanical, absorptive, photosynthetic, etc.). Although his system was not accepted by other botanists, the analysis of the relations between structure, function, and environment has been useful in the study of plant adaptations to different habitats.
