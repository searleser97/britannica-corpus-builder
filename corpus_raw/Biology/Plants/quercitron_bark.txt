Quercitron bark,   inner bark of the black oak, Quercus velutina, which contains a colouring matter used to dye wool bright yellow or orange. At one time this colorant was used with cochineal to produce scarlets of particular brilliance.
To obtain the colouring matter, the exterior bark is shaved from the tree, which is native to the middle and southern United States, to expose the inner bark, which is then detached, ground, and subjected to hot water under pressure. The extract deposits a crude quercetin known commercially as yellow flavine. A second variety, known as red flavine, is deposited when an extract of the bark is digested at the boil with dilute acid. These products are used to dye wool mordanted (fixed) with aluminum or tin compounds to bright shades of yellow and orange.
