F.A.F.C. Went, in full Friedrich August Ferdinand Christian Went,  (born June 18, 1863, Amsterdam, Neth.—died July 24, 1935, Wassenaar), Dutch botanist who initiated the study of plant hormones and advanced the study of botany in the Netherlands.
Went was educated at the University of Amsterdam (Ph.D., 1886), where he attracted considerable attention with his dissertation on plant vacuoles, which he believed arose only from preexisting vacuoles. As director of the Sugar Cane Experiment Station in Java, he undertook a study of sugarcane diseases and succeeded in saving the island’s crop from destruction by the virus disease known as sereh.
After his return to the Netherlands, Went was appointed professor of botany at the University of Utrecht, where he remained until his retirement in 1934. At Utrecht he demonstrated the existence of plant hormones as regulators of physiological activities (e.g., growth) and worked on the role of these hormones in the responses of plants to stimuli (e.g., bending toward light). His work, continued by his son, made Utrecht one of the leading centres of plant study in Europe.
