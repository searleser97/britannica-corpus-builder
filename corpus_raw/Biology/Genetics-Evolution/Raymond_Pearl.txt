Raymond Pearl,   (born June 3, 1879, Farmington, N.H., U.S.—died  Nov. 17, 1940, Hershey, Pa.), American zoologist, one of the founders of biometry, the application of statistics to biology and medicine.
As an instructor at the University of Michigan, where he had earned a Ph.D. in zoology (1902), Pearl recognized the advantages to be gained from applying standard statistical procedures to biological problems. He served as head of the biology department at the Maine Agricultural Experimental Station (1907–18) and as chief of the statistical division of the U.S. Food Administration (1917–19). He was then invited to organize the department of medical statistics and biometry at Johns Hopkins University. Pearl was always interested in the application of biology to human affairs. From the early 1900s he was an avid supporter of the eugenics movement in the United States, but in 1925 he denounced eugenics as scientifically ill-informed and prejudiced. He meanwhile became convinced that the biggest problems of human reproduction lay in the high birth rate found in many nonindustrialized countries and in lower income groups within the industrialized world. He wrote extensively on this subject in the 1930s. Pearl founded the Quarterly Review of Biology (1926) and Human Biology (1929) and was the author of more than 700 articles and books, including Introduction to Medical Biometry and Statistics (1923), which became a prototype for such college texts.
