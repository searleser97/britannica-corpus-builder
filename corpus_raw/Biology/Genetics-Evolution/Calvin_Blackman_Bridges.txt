Calvin Blackman Bridges,  (born Jan. 11, 1889, Schuyler Falls, N.Y., U.S.—died  Dec. 27, 1938, Los Angeles, Calif.), American geneticist who helped establish the chromosomal basis of heredity and sex.
The year after he entered Columbia University (1909), Bridges obtained a position there as laboratory assistant to the geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan. He and Morgan designed experiments using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which showed that heritable variations in the insect could be traced to observable changes in its chromosomes. These experiments led to the construction of “gene maps” and proved the chromosome theory of heredity. Bridges, with Morgan and Alfred Henry Sturtevant, published these results in 1925. That same year he published “Sex in Relation to Chromosomes and Genes,” demonstrating that sex in Drosophila is not determined simply by the “sex chromosomes” (X and Y) but is the result of a “chromosomal balance”—a mathematical ratio of the number of female sex chromosomes (X) to the number of “nonsex” chromosomes (autosomes).
In 1928 Bridges moved with Morgan to the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, where he constructed detailed gene maps of the giant chromosomes found in the salivary gland cells of the fruit fly larva. Later he discovered an important class of Drosophila mutants caused by gene duplications.
