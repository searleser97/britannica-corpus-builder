Franz Weidenreich,  (born June 7, 1873, Edenkoben, Ger.—died  July 11, 1948, New York, N.Y., U.S.), German anatomist and physical anthropologist whose reconstruction of prehistoric human remains and work on Peking man (then called Sinanthropus pekinensis) and other hominids brought him to preeminence in the study of human evolution.
Weidenreich received his M.D. from the University of Strasbourg in 1899 and was appointed professor of anatomy there in 1904. His writings reflected a growing interest in skeletal anatomy that eventually found expression in studies of locomotion, posture, and bone structure as related to problems in primate evolution. Professor of anatomy at the University of Heidelberg from 1919, he became professor of anthropology at the University of Frankfurt (1928–33). Because of his Jewish ancestry he left Germany in 1934 for the University of Chicago and from there went to China to the Peking Union Medical College. Weidenreich then began a series of studies dealing with the jawbones, dentition, skull, and other parts of Peking man. In 1941 he joined the American Museum of Natural History, New York City, and until his death concerned himself with human evolution. He studied Java man (then called Pithecanthropus erectus) and suggested that interconnected changes from early hominids to modern man included bipedalism, increased brain size, and decreased facial size. His views are summarized in a collection of scholarly but popular lectures, Apes, Giants and Man (1946). His fossil descriptions are without equal, and his chronological ordering of them is still considered fundamentally correct. His Shorter Anthropological Papers appeared in 1949.
