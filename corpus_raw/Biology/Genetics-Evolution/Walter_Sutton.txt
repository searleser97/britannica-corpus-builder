Walter Sutton, in full Walter Stanborough Sutton, also called Walter S. Sutton,  (born 1877, Utica, New York, U.S.—died November 10, 1916, Kansas City, Kansas), U.S. geneticist who provided the first conclusive evidence that chromosomes carry the units of inheritance and occur in distinct pairs.
Sutton worked under Clarence E. McClung, one of the investigators who elucidated the chromosomal basis for sex determination, at the University of Kansas (M.A., 1901), and later (1907) he completed medical training at Columbia University. In 1909 he began the practice of surgery in Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri; he continued to practice until his death.
While a student at Columbia, he wrote two papers that greatly affected the history of genetics. Published in 1902 in the Biological Bulletin, “On the Morphology of the Chromosome Group in Brachystola magna” provided the earliest detailed demonstration that the somatic chromosomes (those in cells other than sex cells) of a grasshopper occur in definite, distinguishable, and different pairs of like (or homologous) chromosomes. The paper ended with the hypothesis that chromosomes carry the units of inheritance and that their behaviour during division of the chromosomes of sex cells (meiosis) is the physical basis of the Mendelian law of heredity. Sutton developed this hypothesis in “The Chromosomes in Heredity” (1903) and concluded that chromosomes contain hereditary units and that their behaviour during meiosis is random. His work formed the basis for the chromosomal theory of heredity.
