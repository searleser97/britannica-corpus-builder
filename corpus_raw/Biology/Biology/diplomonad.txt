Diplomonad,  any member of the protozoan order Diplomonadida. Diplomonads are small zooflagellates that inhabit the digestive systems of various animals, including termites, rats, and humans. They typically have two nuclei, each associated with four flagella. Feeding is by digestion or absorption. Of importance to man are Giardia lamblia (see photograph), which occurs in the human intestine and sometimes causes severe diarrhea, and Hexamita meleagridis, the cause of fatal infectious catarrhal enteritis in turkeys.
