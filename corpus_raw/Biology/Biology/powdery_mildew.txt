Powdery mildew,  plant disease of worldwide occurrence that causes a powdery growth on the surface of leaves, buds, young shoots, fruits, and flowers. Powdery mildew is caused by many specialized races of fungal species in the genera Erysiphe, Microsphaera, Phyllactinia, Podosphaera, Sphaerotheca, and Uncinula. Hundreds of species of trees, shrubs, vines, flowers, vegetables, fruits, grasses, field crops, and weeds can be affected by powdery mildew.
The white powdery appearance is due to large numbers of microscopic spores (conidia) borne in chains. These wind-borne spores uniquely do not require free water for germination and infection. New conidia can be produced every 3 to 14 days. If the disease is severe, the mildewed plant parts may be stunted and distorted. Leaves commonly turn yellow and wither, flowers are distorted or fewer in number, and fruit yield and quality are reduced. Mildew is most severe in crowded, shady, poorly aerated locations when nights are cool and days are warm. At maturity or in the fall, round black specks, which are sexual fruiting bodies known as cleistothecia, may form in the mildew. In the spring the cleistothecia crack open to release one or more spore sacs (asei) containing ascospores that blow to nearby plant parts and initiate infection. Overwintering also occurs as mycelial mats on crops or weeds.
Sulfur dust is effective against many powdery mildews but should not be applied in hot weather. A number of other organic treatments, including copper-based fungicides, baking soda solutions, and neem oil, have also proven effective. Planting resistant varieties, staking plants to improve air circulation, removing diseased plant parts, and sterilizing contaminated gardening shears can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
