Stunt,   in agriculture, common symptom of plant disease, resulting in reduced size and loss of vigour. Stunting may be caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, or nematode (eelworm) infections and by noninfectious (abiotic) means including an excess or lack of water, imbalance of soil nutrients, excess light, chemical or mechanical injuries, insect or mite feeding, and too-deep planting. A stunt caused by an infection is often too far advanced to remedy when it is discovered; an abiotic stunt, however, can usually be remedied.
