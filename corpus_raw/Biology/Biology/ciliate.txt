ciliate, or ciliophoran,  any member of the protozoan phylum Ciliophora, of which there are some 8,000 species; ciliates are generally considered the most evolved and complex of protozoans. Ciliates are single-celled organisms that, at some stage in their life cycle, possess cilia, short hairlike organelles used for locomotion and food gathering.
The cilia are usually arranged in rows, known as kineties, on the pellicle (cell covering), but they may fuse together near the cytostome (cell mouth) of some species to form membranelles or undulating membranes (various sheetlike or fan-shaped groupings of cilia); elsewhere on the pellicle, cilia may form limblike tufts called cirri. Most ciliates have a flexible pellicle and contractile vacuoles, and many contain toxicysts or other trichocysts, small organelles with thread- or thorn-like structures that can be discharged for anchorage, for defense, or for capturing prey.
Ciliates have one or more macronuclei and from one to several micronuclei. The macronuclei control metabolic and developmental functions; the micronuclei are necessary for reproduction.
Reproduction is typically asexual, although sexual exchange occurs as well. Asexual replication is usually by transverse binary fission or by budding (q.v.). Sexual phenomena include conjugation (genetic exchange between individuals) and autogamy (nuclear reorganization within an individual). Sexual reproduction does not always result in an immediate increase in numbers; however, conjugation is often followed by binary fission.
Although most ciliates are free-living and aquatic, such as the Paramecium (q.v.), many are ectocommensals, dwelling harmlessly on the gills or integument of invertebrates, and some, such as the dysentery-causing Balantidium (q.v.), are parasitic. For information on representative ciliates, see peritrich; spirotrich; suctorian.
