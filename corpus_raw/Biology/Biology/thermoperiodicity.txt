Thermoperiodicity, also called thermal periodicity,  the growth or flowering responses of plants to alternation of warm and cool periods. Daily temperature fluctuations produce dramatic effects on the growth or flowering of most plants. The lack of lower night temperatures frequently results in poor growth, as can be observed in plants that are grown indoors in even-temperature surroundings. This phenomenon has been applied in the production of tomatoes. The most flowers are produced when tomatoes are grown at 26.7° C (80° F) during the day and 17.2°–20° C (63°–68° F) at night. Thermoperiodic effects are distinct from photoperiodic effects (caused by duration of light).
