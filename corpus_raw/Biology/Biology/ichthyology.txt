Ichthyology,  scientific study of fishes, including, as is usual with a science that is concerned with a large group of organisms, a number of specialized subdisciplines: e.g., taxonomy, anatomy (or morphology), behavioral science (ethology), ecology, and physiology. Because of the great importance of fishes as human food, economic ichthyology is a significant segment of the field.
The ancient Greek naturalists, especially Aristotle, were highly knowledgeable about many aspects of fish biology, and until the end of the 19th century the main advances were in taxonomy, as new species were described and the relationships of those already known were clarified. In the mid-20th century a great increase in interest in oceanography, together with new techniques and equipment for underwater observations (especially the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, or SCUBA), opened many new avenues for the study of fish behaviour and ecology under natural conditions. The development of improved methods of keeping fishes in tanks led to an increase in their use as laboratory animals in the fields of behaviour, ecology, functional anatomy, and even toxicology and parasitology.
A great variety of fishes are kept by aquarium hobbyists, a few of whom make valuable observations on fish behaviour. The majority of fish research, however, is conducted at institutional aquariums, in which large tanks can simulate natural conditions, and at universities and museums, which maintain large collections of preserved specimens. Much fishery research is conducted at the laboratories of government agencies, which are responsible for managing natural fish populations so as to maintain them as a renewable resource.
