Thermoplasma,  (genus Thermoplasma),  any of a group of prokaryotic organisms (organisms whose cells lack a defined nucleus) in the domain Archaea that are noted for their ability to thrive in hot, acidic environments. The genus name is derived from the Greek thermē and plasma, meaning “warmth” (or “heat”) and “formative substance,” respectively, which describe the thermophilic (heat-loving) nature of these organisms.
Thermoplasma are members of class Thermoplasmata (subdivision Euryarchaeota) and are characterized as chemoorganotrophs (organisms that derive energy from organic compounds). They are capable of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism. Their survival in anaerobic habitats is dependent on sulfur respiration, a form of chemolithotrophic metabolism in which carbon and energy are obtained from the reaction of sulfur with organic compounds. Sulfur respiration is an evolutionary adaptation that enables Thermoplasma to thrive in hot sulfur-producing environments, specifically naturally occurring solfataras (sulfur-releasing volcanic steam vents). The organisms also occur in heat-generating coal refuse sites, which produce sulfuric acid via oxidation of pyrite wastes from coal-mining operations. Thermoplasma growth typically requires a pH range of 0.8 to 4.0 and a temperature range of approximately 45 to 60 °C (113 to 140 °F); optimal growth has been reported at pH 1–2 and 59 °C (about 138 °F).
Two species of Thermoplasma have been described: T. acidophilum, discovered in coal refuse and first reported in 1970, and T. volcanium, initially discovered in solfataric fields on Vulcano Island, Italy, and reported in 1988. Similar to other archaea, these organisms lack a cell wall and instead possess a specialized cell membrane made up of ether-linked molecules of glycerol and fatty acids. In Thermoplasma this structure is uniquely adapted to the stress of living in acidic, hot, high-salt habitats.
