Sclerotium,   a persistent, vegetative, resting spore of certain fungi (e.g., Botrytis, Sclerotium). It consists of a hard, dense, compact mycelium (mass of filaments that make up the body of a typical fungus) that varies in form and has a dark-coloured covering. Size varies from a few cells to many; sometimes masses up to 10 cm (4 inches) are formed. The sclerotia of Rhizoctonia are common on potato tubers. The sclerotia of ergot (q.v.) are poisonous to animals, including humans.
