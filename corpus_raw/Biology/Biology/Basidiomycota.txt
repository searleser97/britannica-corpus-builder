Basidiomycota,  large and diverse phylum of fungi (kingdom Fungi) that includes jelly and shelf fungi; mushrooms, puffballs, and stinkhorns; certain yeasts; and the rusts and smuts. Basidiomycota are typically filamentous fungi composed of hyphae. Most species reproduce sexually with a club-shaped spore-bearing organ (basidium) that usually produces four sexual spores (basidiospores). Basidia are borne on fruiting bodies (basidiocarps), which are large and conspicuous in all but the yeasts, rusts, and smuts.
The common name bird’s nest fungus includes species of the genera Crucibulum, Cyathus, and Nidularia of the family Nidulariaceae (order Agaricales), which contains about 60 species. The hollow fruiting body resembles a nest containing eggs (peridioles). The peridioles carry the spores when they disperse at maturity.
Jelly fungus is the common name for several species of the cosmopolitan order Tremellales, including those of the genus Tremella (40 species), so called because they have jellylike fruiting bodies. Frequently brightly coloured (especially yellow and orange) or white, the fungi occur on decaying wood after heavy rains in late summer.
Many species of the subphylum Pucciniomycotina do not form fruiting bodies. The smut fungi, parasitic on higher plants, cause leaf spots, witches’-broom (tufted growth), and galls (swellings).
The ear fungus (Auricularia auricula-judae) is a brown, gelatinous edible fungus found on dead tree trunks in moist weather in the autumn. One of 10 widespread Auricularia species, it is ear- or shell-shaped and sometimes acts as a parasite, especially on elder (Sambucus).
Specific basidiomycete yeasts are known to be lichen symbionts, together with unrelated fungi (typically ascomycetes) and green algae or cyanobacteria. These yeasts are found in the cortex of many macrolichens.
