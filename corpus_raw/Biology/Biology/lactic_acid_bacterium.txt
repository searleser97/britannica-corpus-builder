Lactic-acid bacterium, plural lactic-acid bacteria,  any member of several genera of gram-positive, rod- or sphere-shaped bacteria that produce lactic acid as the principal or sole end product of carbohydrate fermentation. Lactic-acid bacteria are aerotolerant anaerobes that are chiefly responsible for the pickling conditions necessary for the manufacture of pickles, sauerkraut, green olives, some varieties of sausage, and certain milk products, such as buttermilk, yogurt, and some cheeses. Under certain conditions, lactic-acid bacteria may contribute to dental caries and infective endocarditis. Important members include Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus.
