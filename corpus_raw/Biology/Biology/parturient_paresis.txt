Parturient paresis, also called milk fever,  in cattle, a disorder characterized by abnormally low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia). It occurs in cows most commonly within three days after they have calved, at a time when the cowâ€™s production of milk has put a severe strain on its calcium stores. High-producing dairy cattle are especially susceptible. The early signs include loss of appetite and depression or restlessness, followed by muscle weakness and spasms of the hindlegs. In acute cases generalized paresis and apparent coma occur, followed by circulatory collapse and death. The death rate in untreated animals may run as high as 90 percent. Fever is not a sign in this disorder. The most effective treatment is the intravenous injection of calcium gluconate, upon which the animal makes a speedy recovery. There is no effective means of preventing parturient paresis, but modern treatment methods have made deaths from it a rarity in the developed nations. A variety of dietary modifications and supplements have been tried with only moderate success in prevention of the disease.
