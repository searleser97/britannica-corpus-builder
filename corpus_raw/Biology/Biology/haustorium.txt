Haustorium,  highly modified stem or root of a parasitic plant or a specialized branch or tube originating from a hairlike filament (hypha) of a fungus. The haustorium penetrates the tissues of a host and absorbs nutrients and water. In parasitic plants, such as dodder and mistletoe, the haustoria form a vascular union with the host plant to redirect the hostâ€™s nutrients.
The word haustorium also is used to indicate certain cell types in plant embryology. The African Mutelidae family of freshwater mussels have a parasitic larval stage that is called a haustorium.
