Selection coefficient,   in genetics, a measure of the relative reduction in the contribution that a particular genotype (genetic composition) makes to the gametes (sex cells) as compared with another genotype in the population. It expresses the relative advantage or disadvantage of specific traits with respect to survival and reproductive success. The selection coefficient (s) of a given genotype as related to the fitness or adaptive value (W) of that genotype is defined as s = 1 - W. (Fitness is the relative probability that a genotype will reproduce.) A selection coefficient may have a value from zero to one; a genotype that is lethal has a selection coefficient of 1. If a particular genotype produces only 65 percent viable young, its selection coefficient is: s = 1 - 0.65 = 0.35. The selection coefficient is used by researchers to calculate the rate at which gene frequencies change from generation to generation within a population.
