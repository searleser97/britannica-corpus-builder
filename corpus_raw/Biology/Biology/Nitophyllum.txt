Nitophyllum,  genus of red algae in the family Delesseriaceae, consisting of about 25 marine species distributed throughout coastal regions. The genus was named in 1830 by British botanist and mycologist Robert Kaye Greville.
The best-characterized member, Nitophyllum punctatum, is known for its distinctive rose colour and delicate ribbonlike fronds; it has been described from intertidal pools or subtidal areas along the coasts of every continent. Less well-characterized is N. divaricatum, a species native to the Galapagos Islands that may be at risk of decline from climate change and increased herbivory associated with the loss of predators in the region.
Nitophyllum secure themselves to rocky substrates or other algae by a discoid holdfast. The thallus often is fan-shaped, with thin, flat, filmy fronds. Individuals are dioecious (male or female), and reproduction is through the generation of different spore types, typical of red algae (see the section on reproduction and life histories in algae: Form and function of algae).
