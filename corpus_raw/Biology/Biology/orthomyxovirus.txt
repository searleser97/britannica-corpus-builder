Orthomyxovirus,  any virus belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Orthomyxoviruses have enveloped virions (virus particles) that measure between 80 and 120 nm (1 nm = 10−9 metre) in diameter. The nucleocapsid, which consists of a protein shell, or capsid, and contains the viral nucleic acids, has helical symmetry. The orthomyxovirus genome contains eight segments of single-stranded negative-sense RNA (ribonucleic acid), and an endogenous RNA polymerase is present for the transcription of the negative-sense strand into a positive-sense strand to enable protein synthesis. The lipoprotein envelope of the virion contains two glycoproteins, designated hemagglutinin (major antigen) and neuraminidase.
Orthomyxoviridae contains four genera: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, and Thogotovirus. The influenza viruses are known for periodically giving rise to pandemic outbreaks in humans. The different subtypes and strains of influenza viruses are distinguished by the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens they possess. These antigens also determine their infectious properties in humans and other animals.
The infectious agents of bird flu are any of several subtypes of type A influenza virus. Other subtypes of this virus are responsible for most cases of human influenza and for the great influenza pandemics of the past; see influenza pandemic of 1918–19 and influenza pandemic (H1N1) of 2009. Genetic analysis suggests that the influenza A subtypes that afflict mainly nonavian animals, including humans, pigs, whales, and horses, derive at least partially from bird flu subtypes.
