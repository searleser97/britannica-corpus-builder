Golden algae,  (class Chrysophyceae), also called golden-brown algae,  class of about 33 genera and some 1,200 species of algae (division Chromophyta) found in both marine and fresh waters. The group is fairly diverse in form, and its taxonomy is contentious. Most golden algae are single-celled biflagellates with two specialized flagella. They are characterized by the pigment fucoxanthin and by the use of oil droplets as a food reserve. Many are encased in a silica cyst known as a statocyst or statospore, the ornamentation of which can serve to distinguish between species. Sexual reproduction is rare. Asexual reproduction is by the formation of motile and nonmotile spores and by cell division.
