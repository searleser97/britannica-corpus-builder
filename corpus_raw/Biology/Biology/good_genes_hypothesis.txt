Good genes hypothesis,  in biology, an explanation which suggests that the traits females choose when selecting a mate are honest indicators of the maleâ€™s ability to pass on genes that will increase the survival or reproductive success of her offspring. Although no completely unambiguous examples are known, evidence supporting the good genes hypothesis is accumulating, primarily through the discovery of male traits that are simultaneously preferred by females and correlated with increased offspring survival. For example, female North American house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) prefer to mate with bright, colourful males. Such male finches also have high overwinter survivorship. This preference suggests that mating with such males will increase offspring survival. British evolutionary biologist W.D. Hamilton and American behavioral ecologist Marlene Zuk first proposed this hypothesis in the early 1980s.
