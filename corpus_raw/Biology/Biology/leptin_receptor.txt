Leptin receptor, also called obesity receptor,  molecule that receives and transmits signals from leptin, a hormone released from fat cells that is involved primarily in the regulation of metabolism but also serves roles in bone metabolism, immunity, and reproductive function. The leptin receptor is located in the cell membrane in various tissues in the body but is most highly expressed on neurons in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain involved in regulating hunger, body temperature, sleep, and other activities. It is a member of a superfamily of cytokine receptor proteins.
The leptin receptor protein is encoded by the LEPR gene. The receptor has multiple isoforms, which are produced by RNA splicing or post-translational modification of the LEPR gene product. Structurally, all isoforms of the leptin receptor have extracellular and intracellular domains, as well as a transmembrane domain that enables the receptor to transmit signals across the cell membrane.
When leptin binds to leptin receptors, specifically in the hypothalamus, chemical signals are produced that promote a feeling of satiety, reducing hunger. The significance of this function is apparent in the case of leptin receptor deficiency, which is associated with elevated blood plasma levels of leptin and, consequently, persistent hunger and overeating, leading to obesity. Leptin receptor deficiency is also associated with hypogonadism, absent or delayed puberty, and infertility.
