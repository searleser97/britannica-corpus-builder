Paramyxovirus,  any virus belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae. Paramyxoviruses have enveloped virions (virus particles) varying in size from 150 to 200 nm (1 nm = 10âˆ’9 metre) in diameter. The nucleocapsid, which consists of a protein shell (or capsid) and contains the viral nucleic acids, has a helical symmetry. The paramyxovirus genome is made up of a single strand of negative-sense nonsegmented RNA (ribonucleic acid). An endogenous RNA polymerase is present as well and is necessary for the transcription of the negative-sense strand into a positive-sense strand, thereby enabling proteins to be encoded from the RNA. The lipoprotein envelope contains two glycoprotein spikes designated hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion factor (F).
Paramyxoviridae has two subfamilies, Paramyxovirinae and Pneumovirinae, each of which contains multiple genera. Examples of Paramyxovirinae genera include Rubulavirus, which is composed of several species of human parainfluenza viruses and the mumps viruses; Avulavirus, which contains the species Newcastle disease virus (of poultry) as well as various avian paramyxoviruses; and Morbillivirus, which contains the agents that cause measles in humans, distemper in dogs and cats, and rinderpest in cattle. Species of Pneumovirus, which are responsible for the serious respiratory syncytial virus disease in human infants, are classified in the subfamily Pneumovirinae.
