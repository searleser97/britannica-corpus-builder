Plasmodiophoromycota,  phylum of endoparasitic slime molds in the kingdom Chromista. Some scientists assign Plasmodiophoromycota to the kingdom Protista; the taxonomy of the group, however, remains contentious. Several species are economically significant plant pathogens, including Plasmodiophora brassicae, which causes clubroot of cabbage and related plants, and Spongospora subterranea, which causes powdery scab of potatoes.
All members are obligate parasites of algae, fungi, or plants, causing cell enlargement, especially of the plant roots. They are distinguished by the production of motile cells (zoospores) with two unequal anterior flagella.
