Asfarvirus,  any virus belonging to the family Asfarviridae. This family consists of one genus, Asfivirus, which contains the African swine fever virus. Asfarviruses have enveloped virions (virus particles) that are approximately 175–215 nm (1 nm = 10−9 metre) in diameter. An icosahedral capsid (the protein shell surrounding the viral nucleic acids) contains linear double-stranded DNA.
The African swine fever virus is believed to circulate between soft-bodied ticks (Ornithodoros) and pigs, specifically wild pigs (Sus scrofa), warthogs (Phacochoerus aethiopicus), and bush pigs (Potamochoerus porcus). The virus is found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.
