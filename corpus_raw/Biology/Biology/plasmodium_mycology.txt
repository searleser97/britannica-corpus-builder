Plasmodium,  in fungi (kingdom Fungi), a mobile multinucleate mass of cytoplasm without a firm cell wall. A plasmodium is characteristic of the vegetative phase of true slime molds (Myxomycetes) and such allied genera as Plasmodiophora and Spongospora.
The plasmodium of a slime mold is formed from the fusion of myxamoebae or of swarm cells (gametes). Myxamoebae are spores released from a slime mold that possess pseudopodia (lobes of cellular material) and are known for their amoeba-like appearance and behaviour. As a myxamoeba moves across a moist surface, it engulfs bacteria and eventually fuses with a second myxamoeba, thereby initiating the development of a multinucleate plasmodium. Swarm cells, which are characterized by the presence of flagella, can also undergo a similar fusion process to produce a plasmodium.
Plasmodia are shapeless and mobile. They slide over moist substrates, such as rotting logs and decaying leaves, and ingest bacteria and other organic matter. When growth conditions are unfavourable, a plasmodium becomes immobile, and the slime mold progresses to the next stage of its life cycle, marked by the growth of a fruiting body containing a sporangium, or spore case.
