Harpellales,  order of fungi (phylum Glomeromycota, kingdom Fungi) with a vegetative body (thallus) consisting of single or branched filaments (hyphae). Members of Harpellales may occur in the gut or on the cuticle (outer covering) of crabs, beach fleas, boring gribble, and other arthropods. Asexual reproduction occurs by the formation of saclike fruiting bodies (sporangia), the entire cytoplasmic contents of which divide into spores (trichospores).
