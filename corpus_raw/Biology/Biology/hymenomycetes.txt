Hymenomycetes,  name often given to an informal grouping of fungi that are members of the phylum Basidiomycota (kingdom Fungi). It includes more than 5,000 species characterized by an exposed spore-bearing layer (hymenium) and basidiospores that are forcibly discharged. Included are boletes, canterelles, coral fungi, mushrooms, and pore fungi. A fruiting body, almost totally lacking in some genera, is highly developed in others.
