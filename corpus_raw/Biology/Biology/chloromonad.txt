Chloromonad,   any protozoan of the phytoflagellate order Chloromonadida, sometimes considered a member of the algal class Chloromonadophyceae because it has many disk-shaped, chlorophyll-containing chloroplasts. Chloromonads are characterized by two flagella, one projecting forward and one trailing. All species are comparatively rare and of little economic importance. Typically, the cell is flattened and may contain metabolic products, always stored as fats.
