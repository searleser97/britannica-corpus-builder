Castoreum,  an oily, viscid glandular secretion contained in two pairs of membranous sacs between the anus and external genitals of both sexes of beaver. It is yellow or yellow-brown in colour, of a butterlike consistency, and has a highly disagreeable odour due to the presence of an essential oil.
Beavers deposit castoreum on rocks and shorelines to mark territorial boundaries, but its utility as a fixative agent in perfume formulation was among the causes of the near extinction of the North American species (Castor canadensis) by 1900. After beavers were trapped and killed, the sacs were removed and dried, either in smoke or in the sun. Drying darkened and hardened the castoreum and reduced its odour. Castoreum is soluble in alcohol and is prepared for use as a tincture.
