Dendrology, also called forest dendrology or xylology,  study of the characteristics of trees, shrubs, lianas, and other woody plants. Dendrology is generally considered to be a branch of systematic botany or forestry and is primarily concerned with the taxonomy of woody species. Historically, dendrology also encompassed the natural history of the woody species in a given area, but such studies are now more properly ascribed to the field of ecology. Modern dendrology is often focused on the identification of economically useful woody plants and their taxonomic relationships for industrial forestry endeavours, though the discipline is also useful for the conservation of rare or endangered species.
At a basic level, dendrology teaches botanists and foresters the nomenclature and classification of woody plants and how to use morphological characteristics and habitat information to identify unknown species. Major morphological features such as leaves, bark, cones, flowers, fruits, and growth habit are important dendrological identifiers, but more-subtle features, such as buds, twigs, exudates, and leaf scars, are often key factors in distinguishing related species and are particularly useful in the identification of deciduous species in the winter or dry season. Additionally, geographical region, habitat, community composition, and other physical and ecological indicators can provide important identifying information.
