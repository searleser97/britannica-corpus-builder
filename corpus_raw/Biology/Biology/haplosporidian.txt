Haplosporidian,   any protozoan of the sporozoan subclass Haplosporea. They are internal parasites of invertebrates and lower vertebrates. Representative genera are Ichthyosporidium in fish, Coelosporidium in cockroaches, and the type genus Haplosporidium in annelids and other invertebrates. Haplosporidians are amoeboid and may have one or many nuclei. In uninucleate forms, such as Haplosporidium, the nucleus divides repeatedly, and the parasite grows into a large plasmodium (amoeboid mass). The cytoplasm of the plasmodium later divides to form uninucleate bodies, which develop into spores that are transmitted to a new host. The spores have no polar filaments and are covered by a tough membrane that may continue into a taillike process. Some spores have a lid at one pole.
