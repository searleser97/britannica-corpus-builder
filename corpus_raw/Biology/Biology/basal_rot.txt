Basal rot, also called bulb rot,  widespread plant disease caused by a variety of fungi and bacteria that can infect all flower and crop bulbs. Shoots fail to emerge or are stunted, leaves are yellow to reddish or purplish, and they later wilt and die. Roots, usually few, are discoloured and decayed. The rot often starts at the bulb base (root plate), progressing upward and outward. Fungal rots are usually dry to spongy or powdery and moldy, while bacterial rots are commonly moist, soft to mushy, and foul-smelling. The rot often progresses rapidly during storage in warm humid places. Species of the genera Botrytis, Fusarium, and Penicillium are common fungal agents, while bacterial basal rots are frequently caused by Pectobacterium carotovorum and Pseudomonas viridiflava, among others.
The control of basal rot includes the use of disease-free bulbs; proper planting; careful digging and rapid but thorough curing of bulbs before storage; use of varieties resistant to fungal rots; avoidance of overwatering, overcrowding, and overfertilizing; and rotation with nonbulb plants. Nurseries frequently treat bulbs before sale, using a hot water-fungicide soak.
