Charophyceae,  class of green algae (division Chlorophyta) commonly found in fresh water. The taxonomy of the group is contentious, and the class is sometimes placed in its own division, Charophyta. Charophyceae is thought to be the closest extant group of organisms ancestral to bryophytes (primitive terrestrial plants).
Members can be unicellular (desmids), filamentous (Spirogyra), colonial, or multicellular and plantlike (stoneworts). Many species have flagellated cells and store starch in characteristic plastids.
