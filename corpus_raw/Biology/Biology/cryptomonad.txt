Cryptomonad,  (class Cryptophyceae),  any of several genera of small biflagellate algae occurring in both fresh and salt water. Most cryptomonads contain pigments found elsewhere only in red algae and cyanobacteria. Some live harmlessly as zooxanthellae within other organisms. They reproduce asexually in either the motile or nonmotile state, and some species encyst in a spherical cellulose case. Given that cryptomonads exhibit both plantlike and animal-like characteristics, their taxonomy is contentious, and some species are considered to be protozoans rather than algae.
Cryptomonas, a typical photosynthetic genus, has two unequal flagella attached at one end of a flattened oval cell. Some species produce water blooms under favourable conditions but are not known to be toxic. Chilomonas does not have chromatophores (pigment-containing structures) and lives by ingesting organic matter.
