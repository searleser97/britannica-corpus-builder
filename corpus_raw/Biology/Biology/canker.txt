Canker,  plant disease, caused by numerous species of fungi and bacteria, that occurs primarily on woody species. Symptoms include round-to-irregular sunken, swollen, flattened, cracked, discoloured, or dead areas on the stems (canes), twigs, limbs, or trunk. Cankers may enlarge and girdle a twig or branch, killing the foliage beyond it. They are most common on plants weakened by cold or drought stresses, insect injury, nutritional imbalances, nematodes, or root rot.
Control includes removing diseased parts in dry weather; growing adapted or resistant varieties in warm well-drained fertile soil; avoiding overcrowding, overwatering, and mechanical wounds; treating bark and wood injuries promptly; controlling insect and rodent disease carriers; wrapping young trees to prevent sunscald; and keeping plants vigorous by the use of fertilizers.
