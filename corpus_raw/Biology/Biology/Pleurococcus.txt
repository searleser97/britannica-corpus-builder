Pleurococcus,  genus of green algae (family Chaetophoraceae). Pleurococcus species sometimes form a thin green covering on the moist shaded side of trees, rocks, and soil. The spherical cells, either solitary or clumped together, have heavy cell walls that protect them against excessive water loss. Each cell contains a large dense chloroplast, either lobed or plate-shaped. Reproduction is by vegetative cell division only.
