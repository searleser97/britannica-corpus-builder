Sporophyte,  in plants and certain algae, the nonsexual phase (or an individual representing the phase) in the alternation of generationsâ€”a phenomenon in which two distinct phases occur in the life history of the organism, each phase producing the other. The sexual phase is the gametophyte.
In the sporophyte phase a diploid (having two sets of chromosomes) plant body grows and eventually produces spores through meiosis. These spores divide mitotically to produce haploid (having a single set of chromosomes) gamete-producing bodies called gametophytes. The union of two gametes during fertilization produces a diploid zygote, which divides mitotically to form a new sporophyte.
The character and relative extent of the two phases vary greatly among different groups of plants and algae. During the course of evolution, the sporophyte stage has become progressively increased. Thus, in the higher (i.e., vascular) plants the sporophyte is the dominant phase in the life cycle, whereas in the more primitive nonvascular plants (bryophytes) the gametophyte remains dominant. The dominant phase in algae often depends on environmental conditions, though some species have determinant life cycles and are commonly gametophyte-dominant.
