Gonyaulax,  genus of dinoflagellate algae (family Gonyaulacaceae) that inhabit marine, fresh, or brackish water. Several planktonic species are toxic and are sometimes abundant enough to colour water and cause the phenomenon called red tide, which may kill fish and other animals. Humans may be poisoned by eating mussels or other shellfish that have ingested large quantities of Gonyaulax catenella.
Gonyaulax species are covered by closely fitting cellulose plates. As dinoflagellates, they have two flagella: one extends backward from a longitudinal groove in the armour, and the other, in an encircling groove, may help to keep the organism afloat. There is no eyespot (stigma), and the pigment-containing chromatophores are yellow to dark brown.
