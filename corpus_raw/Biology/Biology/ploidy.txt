Ploidy,   in genetics, the number of chromosomes occurring in the nucleus of a cell. In normal somatic (body) cells, the chromosomes exist in pairs. The condition is called diploidy. During meiosis the cell produces gametes, or germ cells, each containing half the normal or somatic number of chromosomes. This condition is called haploidy. When two germ cells (e.g., egg and sperm) unite, the diploid condition is restored.
Polyploidy refers to cells the nuclei of which have three or more times the number of chromosomes found in haploid cells. This condition frequently occurs in plants and may result from chromosome duplication without division of the cytoplasm or from the union of two diploid gametes. Polyploid animals, because they have more than the normal number of sex chromosomes, are usually sterile.
Some cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes that is not a whole multiple of the haploid number. This condition, called aneuploidy, is most often caused by some error resulting in an unequal distribution of chromosomes to the daughter cells. Organisms in which aneuploidy occurs may deviate noticeably from the norm in appearance and behaviour.
