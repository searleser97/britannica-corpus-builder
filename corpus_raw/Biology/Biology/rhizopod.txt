Rhizopod,  any member of the protozoan superclass Rhizopoda. Three types of pseudopodia (cytoplasmic extensions) used in locomotion and digestion are found in members of this superclass: (1) long, thin reticulopodia, which fuse into a network; (2) nonfusing filopodia, similar to reticulopodia; and (3) blunt and fingerlike lobopodia (the pseudopodia formed by Amoeba). Tests (protective shells) are common. For information on important members of the superclass, see amoeba; Entamoeba; foraminiferan; testacean.
