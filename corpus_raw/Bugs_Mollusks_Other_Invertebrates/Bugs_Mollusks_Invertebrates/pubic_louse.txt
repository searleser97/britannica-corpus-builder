Pubic louse,  (Phthirus pubis), also called crab louse,  sucking louse in the human louse family, Pediculidae (suborder Anoplura, order Phthiraptera), that is found principally at the pubic and perianal areas, occasionally on the hairs of the thighs and abdomen, and rarely on other hairy regions of the human body. It is broad and small, averaging 1.5 to 2 mm (0.01 to 0.08 inch) in length. Its first pair of legs is smaller than the other two pairs. When seen under magnification, it looks like a crab.
The eggs, attached to a pubic hair, hatch in two or three weeks. This bloodsucking louse causes itching and inflammation of the skin that may result in eczema.
