Whelk,  any marine snail of the family Buccinidae (subclass Prosobranchia of the class Gastropoda), or a snail having a similar shell. Some are incorrectly called conchs. The sturdy shell of most buccinids is elongated and has a wide aperture in the first whorl. The animal feeds on other mollusks through its long proboscis; some also kill fishes and crustaceans caught in commercial traps. Whelks occur worldwide. Most are cold-water species, which tend to be larger and less colourful than those of the tropics. The common northern whelk (Buccinum undatum) has a stout pale shell about 8 cm (3 inches) long and is abundant in North Atlantic waters. For fulgur whelks, see conch; for rock whelks, see murex.
