Piddock,  any of the marine bivalve mollusks of the family Pholadidae (Adesmoidea). Worldwide in distribution, they are especially adapted for boring into rock, shells, peat, hard clay, or mud. Most species occur in the intertidal zone, a few in deeper water.
One end of each of the two valves is armed with rows of serrated cutting edges for boring. Some species drill to a depth only slightly more than the length of the shell. Others, with extensible siphons, may bore to depths several times the length of the shell. The siphons of many deep borers are protected by tough plates. Like most bivalves, piddocks feed on minute organisms in the water, especially phytoplankton.
The great piddock (Zirfaea crispata), which attains lengths of up to eight centimetres (about three inches), occurs on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Found from the intertidal zone to depths of 75 metres (250 feet), Z. crispata bores into limestone and wood.
The wood piddock (Martesia striata), up to 2.5 centimetres long, commonly occurs in waterlogged timbers cast up on the beach and ranges from North Carolina to Brazil. M. pusilla and M. cuneiformis have similar habits and distribution. Smith’s martesia (M. smithi), which resembles a fat, gray pea, bores into rocks and mollusk shells in the Atlantic Ocean from New York to the Gulf of Mexico.
The flat-topped piddock (Penitella penita), from the Arctic Ocean to Lower California, bores into hard clay, sandstone, and cement, sometimes damaging man-made structures. Some Penitella and Diplothyra species bore into the shells of other mollusks, particularly oysters and abalone.
Pholas dactylus, which bores into gneiss—a very hard rock—is luminescent. At one time it was highly esteemed in Europe as food. Pholas chiloensis, found on the Pacific coast of South America, is eaten locally.
