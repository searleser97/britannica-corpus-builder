Sunspider,  (order Solifugae), formerly Solpugida also spelled sun spider, also called sun scorpion,wind scorpion, or camel spider,  any of more than 1,000 species of the arthropod class Arachnida whose common name refers to their habitation of hot dry regions as well as to their typically golden colour. They are also called wind scorpions because of their swiftness, camel spiders because of their humped heads, and solpugids because of the former scientific name. Their hairiness and rounded opisthosoma (abdomen) are spiderlike, while the front appendages somewhat resemble those of a scorpion. Body length is 10 to 50 mm (0.4 to 2 inches). Sunspiders generally are nocturnal.
Sunspiders are extremely voracious, and the largest forms can kill small vertebrates. The chelicerae (first pair of appendages) are large toothed, jawlike pincers, and the leglike pedipalps (second pair of appendages) have suctorial tips for seizing prey. Unique racket-shaped organs (malleoli) on the hindmost legs may be sensory.
Sunspiders are common in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, including in Africa and southeastward to India, in Indonesia (especially the Celebes), and in parts of the New World.
