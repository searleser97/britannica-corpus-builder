Peacock worm,   (Sabella), any of a genus of segmented marine worms of the class Polychaeta (phylum Annelida). This type of fanworm lives in a tube about 30 to 40 centimetres (12 to 16 inches) long that is open at one end and constructed of mud particles cemented together by mucus. All but the top few centimetres of the tube is buried in the substratum. The front end of the worm has a fan of striped feathery tentacles, used for feeding and respiration, that protrudes from the tube into the overlying seawater. Inorganic and organic particles suspended in the water are trapped in mucus secreted by the tentacles. They are then transported down the tentacles by beating cilia and used either for tube building or passed into the mouth as food. Peacock worms rapidly withdraw their tentacles into the safety of the tube when predators approach. These worms are found both in the intertidal zone and in shallow subtidal areas.
