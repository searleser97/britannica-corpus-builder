Unique-headed bug,  (family Enicocephalidae), also called gnat bug,  any of about 130 species of bugs (order Heteroptera) that have an unusual elongated head that is constricted behind the eyes and also at the base. The unique-headed bug is found throughout the world and is about 4 mm (0.2 inch) long. These bugs are also unique in that their forewings are entirely membranous, as opposed to having a thickened basal portion as in all other true bugs. Both the beak and the antennae have four joints, and the front pair of legs is adapted for grasping prey. Though some species are found in all zoogeographic regions, little is known of their habits. Two North American species are Enicocephalus formicina and Systelloderus biceps (Henicocephalus culicis).
