Leaf-rolling grasshopper, also called wingless cricket,  any of a group of insects in the subfamily Gryllacridinae (order Orthoptera) that are wingless or nearly wingless, have long cerci and antennae, and appear somewhat humpbacked. The leaf-rolling grasshoppers are closely related to raspy crickets, which are also in subfamily Gryllacridinae. The California leaf roller (Camptonotus carolinensis), about 15 mm (0.5 inch) long, is active at night, as are other members of this subfamily. The leaf-rolling grasshopper spends the day in a leaf that it rolls and ties with silk; at night the insect emerges and feeds on aphids. It has no sound-producing or hearing organs.
