Mussel shrimp, also called seed shrimp, or ostracod,  any of a widely distributed group of crustaceans belonging to the subclass Ostracoda (class Crustacea) that resemble mussels in that the body is enclosed within a bivalved (two-valved) shell. Mussel shrimp differ from most other crustaceans in having a very short trunk that has lost its external segmentation, or divisions. The 6,650 living species include marine, freshwater, and terrestrial forms.
Some 10,000 extinct species are known, fossil ostracods being known from Cambrian Period (about 542 million to 488 million years ago) to recent times. The several extinct species are of particular stratigraphic significance in nonmarine marls, limestones, and shales, often serving as index fossils owing to their abundance, widespread geographic occurrence, and limited vertical range. Certain genera are commonly used as guides in subsurface petroleum exploration, in a manner analogous to that of foraminifera in marine strata.
Mussel shrimp are only about 1–2 mm (about 0.04–0.08 inch) long. Common genera include Cypris and Cypridina. The largest ostracods are in the genus Gigantocypris and grow to 23 mm. Most mussel shrimp live on or about the sea bottom. Some feed on microorganisms and organic debris; others are predators on small invertebrates; and a few are parasitic. Most prefer shallow water, but some have been collected at depths of 2,000 metres (about 6,600 feet).
