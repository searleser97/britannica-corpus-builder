Chafer,  (subfamily Melolonthinae), also called June Beetle, May-June Beetle, or June Bug,  any of a group of beetles in the family Scarabaeidae (insect order Coleoptera). Adult leaf chafers (Macrodactylus) eat foliage, whereas grubs feed underground on plant roots. The adult female deposits her eggs in the soil, and the larvae live underground for two to three years, depending on the species. They pupate in the fall, but the adults remain underground until the following spring.
A well-known, destructive chafer is the rose chafer (M. subspinosus), a tan, long-legged beetle that feeds on the flowers and foliage of grapes, roses, and other plants. Poultry that eat rose chafer grubs may be poisoned. Other scarab subfamilies also include species called chafers (see also flower chafer; shining leaf chafer).
