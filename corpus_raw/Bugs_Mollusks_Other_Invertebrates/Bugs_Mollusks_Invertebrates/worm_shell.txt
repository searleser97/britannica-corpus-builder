Worm shell,   any marine snail of the family Vermetidae (subclass Prosobranchia, class Gastropoda). The shell of these snails consists of an irregularly coiled, narrow tube that resembles a worm. Most species of both families live cemented to rock or coral substrates, and many are found in coral reef habitats. They feed on suspended particulate matter in seawater, which they obtain by secreting a mucous net from a gland in the foot. This net spreads out in the current, and food particles stick to it. After a few minutes the net is pulled in by the mouth and ingested and a new net spread. The snails often form a distinct zone on tropical shores and reach densities of more than 60,000 per square metre, producing thick deposits of intertwined shells.
