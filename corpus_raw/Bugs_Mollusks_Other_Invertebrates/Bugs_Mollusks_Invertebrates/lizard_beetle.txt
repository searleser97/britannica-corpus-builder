Lizard beetle,  (family Languriidae), also called Languriid Beetle,  any of some 400 species of long, narrow beetles (insect order Coleoptera), most of which are found in Asia and North America. Adult lizard beetles are 2 to 10 mm (0.1 to 0.4 inch) long, are reddish in colour with dark wing covers (elytra), and feed on leaves and pollen. The larvae of the clover stem borer (Languria mozardi) may become serious pests in clover fields. Members of many species make squeaking sounds using well-developed stridulatory organs on top of the head.
