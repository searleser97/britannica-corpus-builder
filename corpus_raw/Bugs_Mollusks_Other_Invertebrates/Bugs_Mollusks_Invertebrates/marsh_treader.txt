Marsh treader, also called water measurer,  any insect of the family Hydrometridae (order Heteroptera), so named because of its slow, deliberate manner of moving as it walks along the surface of a pond or crawls among shore vegetation. Marsh treaders, worldwide in distribution, are usually found among the cattails in marshy ponds containing algae. More than 100 species of the insect have been described.
The marsh treader, about 8 mm (0.3 inch) long, is recognized by its sticklike body and long, thin, threadlike legs. Its slender head is almost as long as the thorax, and the antennae, extending in front of the head, resemble another pair of legs. The body is covered with fine, velvety hairs. Marsh treaders feed on small crustaceans and insect larvae, especially mosquito larvae.
The female lays beautifully sculptured eggs and glues each one to a plant just above the water line. Each egg is about one fourth the length of the female.
