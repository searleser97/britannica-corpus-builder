False scorpion, also called pseudoscorpion,  any of the 1,700 species of the order Pseudoscorpiones (sometimes Chelonethida) of the arthropod class Arachnida. They resemble true scorpions but are tailless and only 1 to 7.5 mm (0.04 to 0.3 inch) long. The chelicerae (first pair of appendages) bear silk-gland openings, and the pedipalps (second pair of appendages) are venomous pincers. In courtship the male may show protrusible structures (“ram’s horns”) on the belly.
False scorpions occur worldwide except in cold regions. Most live under bark or stones; some are found in books and old chests. They molt (shed skin), brood their young, and hibernate in silken nests.
The book scorpion (Chelifer cancroides), 4 mm long, occurs in houses and libraries. It feeds on book lice, carpet beetle larvae, clothes moths, and bedbugs.
