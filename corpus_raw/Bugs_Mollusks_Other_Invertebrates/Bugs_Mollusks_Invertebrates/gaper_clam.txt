Gaper clam, also called Horse Clam,   (Tresus nuttallii and Tresus capax), either of two species of bivalve mollusks of the family Mactridae. These clams live in sand and mud flats along the coast of western North America from Alaska to Baja California. The shells of both species reach about 200 millimetres (8 inches) in length. They are roughly oblong in shape and creamy white in colour. Gaper clams have long, fused siphons that are contained in sheathlike tubes; the siphons are not fully retractable into the shell. The clams burrow up to one metre (three feet) deep into sediment. Gaper clams are edible and are heavily fished at spring tides. They are commonly infected with larval tapeworm cysts, but these are harmless to humans.
