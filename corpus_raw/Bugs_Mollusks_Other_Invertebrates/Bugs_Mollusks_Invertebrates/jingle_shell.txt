Jingle shell, also called saddle oyster,  any of several marine invertebrates of the class Bivalvia belonging to the family Anomiidae. In most species of these oysterlike bivalves, one shell valve (i.e., half) is closely appressed to a rock surface and has a large hole in its wall through which a calcified byssus (tuft of horny threads) attaches to the rock and thus anchors the animal. The upper shell valve, though it is more convex than the lower, is usually irregular in shape and follows the configuration of the rock surface.
Jingle shells are often thin and translucent and have pearly interiors. They make a jingling sound when shaken against each other, hence the name jingle shell. They are much used in the manufacture of lampshades, chimes, and other ornaments.
