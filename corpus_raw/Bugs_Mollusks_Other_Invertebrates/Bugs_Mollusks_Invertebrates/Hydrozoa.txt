Hydroid,  any member of the invertebrate class Hydrozoa (phylum Cnidaria). Most hydroids inhabit marine environments, but some have invaded freshwater habitats. Hydroids may be either solitary or colonial, and there are about 3,700 known species.
Hydroids have three basic life-cycle stages: (1) a tiny free-swimming ciliated planula larva about 1 mm (0.04 inch) long, which settles and metamorphoses into (2) a sessile (attached), usually colonial polyp stage, which in turn liberates (3) a gamete-producing male or female medusa (“jellyfish”). This cycle is exemplified by the genus Obelia, whose members are widely distributed throughout the world. Many hydroids have, through evolution, suppressed the medusa by retaining it on the sessile hydroid colony. Hydra, a well-known freshwater genus that has the distinction of being solitary rather than colonial, lacks a medusa stage.
Colonies of hydroids are typically 5 to 500 mm (0.2 to 20 inches) or more high and are branched; the branches bear the individuals, or zooids (hydroid polyps). Each zooid consists of a tubular body that has two layers separated by a thin jellylike mesoglea (layer of connective tissue), a terminal mouth, and surrounding circlet(s) of tentacles. The zooids are joined basally to a common living tube called the stolon that runs the length of the colony. The living tube, which is assumed to permit the exchange of food between individuals, is protected within a tough chitinous sheath, the perisarc. Colonies of hydroids grow vegetatively by increasing the number of hydranths (the main body of the hydroid). Reproductive polyps (gonozooids) occur intermittently on the colony. They release either medusae (typically) or planula larvae (if the medusae are retained or reduced), depending on the species. Members of some species can retract their polyps within a protective extension of the perisarc, the hydrotheca (a cuplike structure that covers the polyp), but others lack such a structure.
