Whip scorpion,  (order Uropygi, sometimes Thelyphonida),  any of approximately 105 species of the arthropod class Arachnida that are similar in appearance to true scorpions except that the larger species have a whiplike telson, or tail, that serves as an organ of touch and has no stinger. The second pair of appendages, the pedipalps, are spiny pincers, and the third pair are long feelers. Whip scorpions secrete an irritating mist, which has a vinegar-like odour in Mastigoproctus giganteus, the vinegarroon (variably spelled) of the southern United States and Mexico. The largest of the whip scorpions, the vinegarroon can grow to 85 mm (about 3.3 inches) in length. Whip scorpions are most common from India and Japan to New Guinea, although two genera occur in the New World.
