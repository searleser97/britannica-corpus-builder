Chiton,  any of numerous flattened, bilaterally symmetrical marine mollusks, worldwide in distribution but most abundant in warm regions. The approximately 600 species are usually placed in the class Placophora, Polyplacophora, or Loricata (phylum Mollusca).
Chitons are usually oval in shape. On the dorsal (upper) surface is a row of eight overlapping plates surrounded or covered by a tough girdle. Chitons use a large, flat foot for creeping along and clinging to rocks; they also have a well-developed radula (filelike structure) with which to scrape algae and other plant food from rocks. On either side of the foot is a groove containing the gills.
About 5 cm (2 inches) is the maximum length of most chitons, but Cryptochiton stelleri, of the Pacific coast of North America, may grow to about 43 cm. Chitons are very flexible and can fit snugly into rock crevices or curl into a ball when detached. They can also adhere so firmly to rocks that they may be injured when pried loose.
Chitons, especially in warm areas, are usually found in the intertidal zone or in shallow water. In colder regions more species inhabit deeper water to about 4,000 metres (13,000 feet), although some have been found to depths of 7,000 metres. Most are nocturnal in habit. The tremendous numbers of free-swimming young (trochophores) are an important element in the marine plankton.
