Worm,  any of various unrelated invertebrate animals that typically have soft, slender, elongated bodies. Worms usually lack appendages; polychaete annelids are a conspicuous exception. Worms are members of several invertebrate phyla, including Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Annelida (segmented worms), Nemertea (ribbon worms), Nematoda (roundworms, pinworms, etc.), Sipuncula (peanutworms), Echiura (spoonworms), Acanthocephala (spiny-headed worms), Pogonophora (beardworms), and Chaetognatha (arrowworms).
The term is also loosely applied to centipedes and millipedes; to larval (immature) forms of other invertebrates, particularly those of certain insects; and to some vertebratesâ€”e.g., the blindworm (Anguis fragilis), a limbless, snakelike lizard. At one time all phyla of wormlike animals were classed as Vermes, a term no longer in common use.
The major groups of worms include various species of flatworm, annelid, ribbon worm, spiny-headed worm, and aschelminth (qq.v.). Worms typically have an elongated, tubelike body, usually rather cylindrical, flattened, or leaflike in shape and often without appendages. They vary in size from less than 1 mm (0.04 inch) in certain nematodes to more than 30 m (100 feet) in certain ribbon worms (phylum Nemertea).
Worms are universal in distribution, occurring in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. Some types of worms are parasitic, others are free-living. From a human perspective, worms are important as soil conditioners (e.g., annelids, aschelminths) and as parasites of people and domestic animals (e.g., platyhelminths, aschelminths) and of crops (e.g., aschelminths). Ecologically, worms form an important link in the food chains in virtually all ecosystems of the world.
