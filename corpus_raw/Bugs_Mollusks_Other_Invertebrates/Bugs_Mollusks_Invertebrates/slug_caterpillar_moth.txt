Slug caterpillar moth,  (family Limacodidae),  any of approximately 1,000 species of insects (order Lepidoptera) that are widely distributed throughout the world but are concentrated in the tropics. These moths are named after their short, fleshy, sluglike caterpillars. In the caterpillars, suckers have replaced the typical larval prolegs, and the larvae seem to glide rather than crawl. Some larvae are brightly coloured and have stinging hairs capable of causing a rash in humans who touch them. The caterpillars feed on plants and pupate in oval cocoons hung between leaves.
One species, the hag moth (Phobetron pithecium), derives its name from the larvaâ€™s fleshy appendages, which are covered with brown stinging hairs resembling disheveled or tousled hair. When the caterpillar spins its cocoon the appendages are transferred to the outside of the cocoon, where they serve for protection and camouflage.
