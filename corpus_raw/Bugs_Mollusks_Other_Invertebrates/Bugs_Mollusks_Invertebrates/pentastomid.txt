Pentastomid,  any of about 100 species of tiny parasites belonging to the Pentastomida, now generally considered a subclass of the phylum Arthropoda. Pentastomids range from a few millimetres to 14 cm (about 6 inches) in length and lack respiratory, circulatory, and excretory organs.
Pentastomids live in the respiratory systems of vertebrate hosts. Although they are mostly tropical or subtropical, those with homoiothermic (warm-blooded) hosts may also be found in cold regions. Reptiles are the most common victims of pentastomid infestation. Porocephalus is parasitic in snakes and rodents. Lingulata species parasitize various mammals, including dogs. A few species are of medical interest because they infest humans.
