Symphylan,  (class Symphyla), also called symphylid,  any of a group of insects that are often included with the centipedes (Chilopoda) and millipedes (Diplopoda) in the superclass Myriapoda of the subphylum Labiata. The approximately 120 species resemble small centipedes with the largest being less than 10 mm (0.4 inch) long. The antennae are long and many-jointed. The soft, white body is divided into 14 segments, 12 of which bear pairs of hooklike legs. All of the legs on one side move simultaneously, alternating with those on the opposite side, thus producing a twisting, turning motion.
Symphylans occur worldwide but chiefly in the tropics. Most live in and eat decaying plant matter, although some feed on dead insects and the tender parts of living plants. The so-called garden centipede (Scutigerella immaculata) of North America, Europe, and Hawaii damages beets, celery, lettuce, and other crops. Scolopendrella is common in North America.
