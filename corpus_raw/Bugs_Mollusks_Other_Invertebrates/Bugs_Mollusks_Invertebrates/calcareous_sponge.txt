Calcareous sponge,  any of a class (Calcarea) of sponges characterized by skeletons composed entirely of calcium carbonate spicules (needlelike structures). Calcareous sponges occur mainly on the rocky bottoms of the continental shelves in temperate, shallow waters; they are usually dull in colour. Most are small, seldom exceeding 15 cm (6 inches). A few fossil representatives are known from the Burgess Shale (a rock formation deposited about 505 million years ago) in British Columbia, Canada.
