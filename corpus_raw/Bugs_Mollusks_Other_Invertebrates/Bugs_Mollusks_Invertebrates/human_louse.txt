Human louse,  (Pediculus humanus), also called body louse,  a common species of sucking louse in the family Pediculidae (suborder Anoplura, order Phthiraptera) that is found wherever human beings live, feeds on blood, and can be an important carrier of epidemic typhus and other louse-borne human diseases such as trench fever and relapsing fever. There are two subspecies, Pediculus humanus capitis, the head louse, and P. humanus humanus, the body louse, or cootie.
Smaller and tougher than the body louse, the head louse attaches itself to the hair or scalp by means of claws on its legs. Young lice are sometimes called red backs because of their blood-red colour after feeding. They are called black backs, or gray backs, after digestion has taken place. Head lice pass from host to host by direct contact. The easiest way to get rid of them is to keep the hair and scalp clean and to use a fine-tooth comb frequently. In earlier times, when hygiene was not commonly practiced, heads were shaved and wigs worn in an effort to get rid of head lice.
The body louse is larger than the head louse and ranges in colour from white to brown. It lives in the seams of clothes but is not dependent upon clothing. The female lays her eggs, which hatch in about a week, in underclothes. The body louse is transferred by direct contact. It is sensitive to heat and cannot survive hot temperatures; therefore, ordinary laundry procedures will kill it.
