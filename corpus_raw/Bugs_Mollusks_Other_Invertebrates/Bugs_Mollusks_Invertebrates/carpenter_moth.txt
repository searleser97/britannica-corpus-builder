Carpenter moth,  (family Cossidae),  any member of a group of insects in the moth and butterfly order, Lepidoptera, whose pale, nearly hairless larvae bore in wood or pithy stems and can be highly destructive. The larvae live one to three years. Adults have vestigial mouthparts, long, thick bodies, and gray to brown wings that are frequently mottled or spotted. The wingspan varies from under 2.5 cm (1 inch) in the temperate zone to about 25 cm (10 inches) in Xyleutes boisduvali of Australia.
The carpenterworm moth (Prinoxystus robiniae) has a wingspan of about 5 cm (2 inches) and is the most familiar North American cossid. The mahogany-coloured larvae of the goat moth (Cossus cossus) attack deciduous trees and exude a strong, goatlike odour. The members of this family are sometimes called leopard moths because the species Zeuzera pyrina has white wings with black or blue blotches, similar to the coat pattern of the feline snow leopard. Its larvae bore in deciduous trees, especially fruit trees, for about two years before pupating within their larval burrows.
