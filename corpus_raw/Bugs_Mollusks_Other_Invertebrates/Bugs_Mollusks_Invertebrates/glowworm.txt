Glowworm,  any crawling, luminous insect that emits light either continuously or in prolonged glows rather than in brief flashes as do most fireflies. Principal types of glowworms are: (1) wingless adult females of certain beetles of the family Lampyridae, particularly the common European glowworm, Lampyris noctiluca, (2) larvae of lampyrid fireflies (common in the Americas) and of elaterid fireflies (tropical), (3) larvae and adult females of certain beetles of the genera Phengodes (North America) and Phrixothrix (South America), and (4) larvae of certain gnats (e.g., the cave-dwelling Arachnocampa of New Zealand and Platyura of the central Appalachians).
Glowworm bioluminescent organs vary widely in size, number, location, and structure, suggesting independent evolutionary origins of light-producing ability. In Phengodes the light is emitted by solitary giant cells; in Arachnocampa, by modified excretory organs; in Platyura, by modified salivary glands; and in Phrixothrix, Lampyris, and lampyrid larvae, by organs similar to, but simpler than, the “lanterns” of flashing types of fireflies. The light is usually greenish, but the “railroad worm” (Phrixothrix) has a red headlight in addition. In Lampyris, Phengodes, and Phrixothrix the flying male, which may itself be nonluminous, is attracted to the female’s light. In Platyura and Arachnocampa, the larvae produce light to attract prey that they then capture in their sticky webs.
