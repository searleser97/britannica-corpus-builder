Some species occur under bark in dead trees, whereas others burrow in sand or live in mammal burrows or termite nests. They are shiny black, oval, and from 0.5 to 10 mm (0.02 to 0.4 inch) long.
The hister beetleâ€™s wing covers (elytra) are short, leaving the last two abdominal segments exposed. When disturbed, these beetles lie motionless, resembling tiny black seeds.
