Wood wasp,  primitive insect belonging to any of three families in the suborder Symphyta (order Hymenoptera): Xiphydriidae, Orussidae (sometimes spelled Oryssidae), and Anaxyelidae. Orussidae are known as parasitic wood wasps; Anaxyelidae are known as cedar wood wasps. Xiphydriids, found in Europe and North America, are about 20 to 25 mm (about 0.8 to 1 inch) long, cylindrical in shape, and blackish in colour. The larvae bore into the wood of dead or dying deciduous trees.
Parasitic wood wasps are relatively rare but are widely distributed throughout the world. In North America and Europe one genus, Orussus, occurs. Adults are black and about 8 mm (0.3 inch) in length. Larvae are parasitic on wood-boring beetles in the family Buprestidae.
The cedar wood wasps, represented in North America by the species Syntexis libocedrii, are found in the Pacific coastal states. Adults are about 8 to 14 mm (0.3 to 0.5 inch) in length. The larva bores into the wood of the incense cedar, Calocedrus decurrens.
