Pleasing fungus beetle,  (family Erotylidae),  any of more than 3,500 species of widely distributed, mostly tropical beetles (insect order Coleoptera) that feed on fungi such as mushrooms and are often brightly coloured with orange, red, and black patterns. Pleasing fungus beetles range in size from 3 to 20 mm (0.1 to 0.8 inch). Although most species feed on fungi, some bore into wood and feed on sap, and others bore into and feed on plant stems.
