Mitre shell,  any of several marine snails constituting the family Mitridae (subclass Prosobranchia of the class Gastropoda, phylum Mollusca), in which the thick shell typically is bullet shaped, vaguely resembling a bishopâ€™s headdress, or mitre. Mitres are most common in the Indo-Pacific region. The 10-centimetre (4-inch) episcopal mitre (Mitra mitra), which has an orange-checked shell, is one of the largest members of the family.
