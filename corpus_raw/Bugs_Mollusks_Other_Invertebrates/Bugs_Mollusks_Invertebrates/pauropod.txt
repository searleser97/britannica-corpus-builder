Pauropod,   any member of the class Pauropoda (phylum Arthropoda), a group of small, terrestrial invertebrates that superficially resemble tiny centipedes or millipedes. The approximately 380 known species are found worldwide under dead leaves, stones, and rotten wood. They feed chiefly on fungi and decaying organic matter.
Pauropods range in length from 0.5 to 2 mm (0.02 to 0.08 inch). The pauropod head is tiny, with large, branched antennae; deep-set mandibles; and two pairs of maxillae (accessory jaws). There is also a pair of vibration-sensitive organs (pseudoculi) instead of eyes. The body consists of 11 partially fused segments from which project nine pairs of legs, the first pair reduced and five jointed. Respiration occurs at the body surface in pauropods. Their reproductive system is equally simple; as in millipedes, the reproductive organs open at the bases of the second legs, males having a pair of penes.
