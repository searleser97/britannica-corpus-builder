Gastrotrich,  any of about 500 species of the phylum Gastrotricha, a group of microscopic aquatic invertebrates that live in the spaces between sand grains and soil particles and on the outer coverings of aquatic plants and animals. They occur in salt water and freshwater and also on sandy seashores.
The gastrotrich body, which ranges in size from 0.1 to 1.5 millimetres (0.004 to 0.06 inch), is covered by a cuticle that is often scaly and spiny. The head is swollen and lobelike. Adhesive tubules are used for anchorage. Cilia—especially on the head and on the ventral, or bottom, surface—are used for locomotion.
Bacteria, organic debris, and certain protozoans (diatoms) are ingested by a sucking muscular pharynx, which leads to the intestine. Many species are hermaphroditic (i.e., reproductive organs of both sexes occur in the same individual). One group, Chaetonotoidea, has only parthenogenetic females (i.e., they produce unfertilized eggs that, in turn, produce females). Two types of eggs are known for freshwater gastrotrichs: tachyblastic eggs, which develop immediately, and opsiblastic eggs, which remain inactive for long periods and can survive dry and freezing conditions.
Gastrotrichs were formerly placed within a phylum of animals called the Aschelminthes. The similarities among aschelminths are now understood to be the result of independent evolution in comparable habitats rather than close evolutionary relationships. Many aschelminth groups have been raised to the level of independent phyla.
