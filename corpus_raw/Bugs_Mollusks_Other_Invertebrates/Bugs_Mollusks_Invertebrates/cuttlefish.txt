Cuttlefish,  any of several marine cephalopods of the order Sepioidea, related to the octopus and squid and characterized by a thick internal calcified shell called the cuttlebone. The approximately 100 species of cuttlefish range between 2.5 and 90 cm (1 to 35 inches) and have somewhat flattened bodies bordered by a pair of narrow fins. All species have eight arms and two longer tentacles that are used in capturing prey and can be withdrawn into two pouches. Suction disks are located on the arms and on expanded pads at the tips of the tentacles.
Cuttlefish inhabit shallow tropical or temperate coastal waters, usually migrating to deeper water in winter. The common cuttlefish breeds during spring and summer, producing about 100 to 300 eggs. Sepia species feed mainly on crustaceans, small fishes, and each other. Their main enemies are large aquatic animals. Cuttlefish are used by humans as food, as a source of ink, and for the cuttlebone, a dietary supplement providing calcium for cage birds. The modern cuttlefish appeared in the Miocene Epoch (which began about 23 million years ago) and is derived from a belemnite-like ancestor.
Morphological studies have shown that cuttlefish brains are large relative to their body size, and behavioral studies have demonstrated that at least one species possesses the ability for self-control in a manner similar to that of intelligent vertebrates. Behavioral studies involving the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) report that the species can learn to forgo a lower-quality food item (such as a bit of crab or prawn meat), delaying immediate gratification, in order to receive a preferred higher-quality food reward (such as a live shrimp) at a later time.
