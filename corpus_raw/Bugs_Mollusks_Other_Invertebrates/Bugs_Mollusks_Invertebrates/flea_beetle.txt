Flea beetle,  any member of the insect subfamily Alticinae (Halticinae) belonging to the leaf beetle family Chrysomelidae (order Coleoptera). These tiny beetles, worldwide in distribution, are usually less than 6 mm (0.25 inch) in length and dark or metallic in colour. The enlarged hindlegs are adapted for jumping. Flea beetles are important pests of cultivated plants: the adults feed on the leaves and the larvae on the roots. Some flea beetles carry plant diseases (e.g., early potato blight).
The grape flea beetle (Altica chalybea), 4 to 5 mm (0.16 to 0.2 inch) long and dark steel-blue in colour, eats grape buds in early spring; both the adults and larvae feed on grape leaves in the summer. They can be controlled by spraying an arsenical poison on the grape leaves.
The striped flea beetle (Phyllotreta striolata) infests cabbage and similar plants. The cucumber beetle (Epitrix cucumeris) feeds on cucumbers and melon vines, E. hirtipennis attacks tobacco plants, and E. fuscula eats tomatoes and potatoes. The flea beetle Aphthona flava has been released in the United States and Canada as a biological control for the weed leafy spurge.
