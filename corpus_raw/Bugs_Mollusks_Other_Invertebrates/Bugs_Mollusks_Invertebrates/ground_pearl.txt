Ground pearl,  (genus Margarodes),  any of a group of scale insects in the family Margarodidae (order Homoptera) that have an iridescent globular body 2 to 4 mm (0.08 to 0.16 inch) in length. Ground pearl insects vary in colour from metallic bronze, red, or gold to cream or silver. They are worldwide in distribution, and are often found on the roots of plants or scattered in the soil. They can best be controlled by using sufficient amounts of water and fertilizer around susceptible plants.
In the tropics, the protective waxy coverings that are secreted by ground pearls are used as beads and ornaments. These insects are also a source of varnish.
