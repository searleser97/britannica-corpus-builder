Meadow grasshopper,  (subfamily Conocephalinae), also called meadow katydid,  any of a group of grasshoppers in the family Tettigoniidae (order Orthoptera) that are slender, small to medium-sized, and found in grassy meadows near lakes and ponds. When disturbed, they enter the water, cling to underwater plants, and can remain submerged for several minutes.
Orchelimum (see photograph), one of the most abundant and widespread types of meadow grasshoppers, has large orange eyes and a body that is brown on top and green on the bottom. The lesser meadow katydids (Conocephalus) are slender and tend to be small in size compared with other meadow grasshopper genera. The meadow grasshopper produces a song, consisting of clicks and buzzes, during the day or at night.
