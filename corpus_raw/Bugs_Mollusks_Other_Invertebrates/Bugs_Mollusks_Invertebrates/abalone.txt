Abalone,  any of several marine snails, constituting the genus Haliotis and family Haliotidae in the subclass Prosobranchia (class Gastropoda), in which the shell has a row of holes on its outer surface. Abalones are found in warm seas worldwide.
The dishlike shell is perforated near one edge by a single row of small holes that become progressively filled during the animal’s growth; the last five to nine holes remain open to serve as outlets for the snail’s waste products. The shell’s lustrous, iridescent interior is used in the manufacture of ornaments. The large muscular foot of the abalone is eaten as a delicacy in several countries. Depending on the species, abalones usually range from 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) across and up to 7.5 cm in depth. About 50 species have been described. The largest abalone is the 30-cm red abalone (H. rufescens) of the western coast of the United States. H. rufescens and several other species are raised commercially in abalone farms, particularly in Australia, China, Japan, and along the western coast of the United States. Commercial fisheries for abalones exist in California, Mexico, Japan, and South Africa.
