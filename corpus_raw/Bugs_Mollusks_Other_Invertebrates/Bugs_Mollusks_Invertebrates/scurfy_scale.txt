Scurfy scale,  (Chionaspis furfura),  a species of insect in the armoured scale family, Diaspididae (order Homoptera), that is found on shaded trees, giving the bark a scurfy appearance. This insect has gray, pear-shaped females (about 3 mm [0.1 inch] long) and smaller, white males with three longitudinal ridges. An important insect pest of fruit and ornamental trees in the United States, the scurfy scale causes spotting of foliage and fruit. In warm climates, there are two generations a year, whereas in cooler regions there is only one. Control is usually through use of an oil spray.
