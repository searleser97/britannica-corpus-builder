Ray spider,   any spider of the family Theridiosomatidae (order Araneida), known for their conelike webs. Most ray spiders are less than 3 mm (0.125 inch) in body length and are usually found near streams or in damp areas. The strands of the ray spiderâ€™s web extend outward in raylike groups of three or four. The web is pulled into a cone shape by a strand attached from the web centre to a nearby twig. This strand, held taut by the spider, is released when an insect becomes caught in the web; the web snaps back, further ensnaring the insect.
