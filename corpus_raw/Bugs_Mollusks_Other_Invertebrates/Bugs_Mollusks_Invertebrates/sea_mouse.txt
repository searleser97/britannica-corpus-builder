Sea mouse,   (Aphrodita), any of a genus of marine worms of the class Polychaeta (phylum Annelida), named for their mouselike appearance and behaviour.
Sea mice are usually 7.5–15 centimetres (3–6 inches) long; however, some attain a length of 30 centimetres (12 inches). The slightly arched back is covered with a dense mat of hairlike setae about 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) long. The sea mouse burrows and creeps in a manner suggestive of a true mouse as it searches for dead and decaying bodies of animals—its main diet.
Near its mouth are two pairs of feeler-like appendages. Eyes are absent. Locomotion is by means of many small, bristly, paddle-like appendages. Sea mice are hermaphroditic; i.e., functional reproductive organs of both sexes occur in the same individual. The eggs of one individual, however, are fertilized by the sperm of another.
Sea mice are found just below the intertidal zone, usually on sandy or muddy bottoms, on both sides of the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean Sea. Aphrodita hastata occurs on the North American coast from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Chesapeake Bay. Specimens are often found washed ashore after storms. A common European species is A. aculeata.
