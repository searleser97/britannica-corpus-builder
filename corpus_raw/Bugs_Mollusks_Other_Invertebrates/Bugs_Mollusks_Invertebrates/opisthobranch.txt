Opisthobranch,  any marine gastropod of the approximately 2,000 species of the subclass Opisthobranchia. These gastropods, sometimes called sea slugs and sea hares, breathe either through gills, which are located behind the heart, or through the body surface. The shell and mantle cavity are reduced or lacking in most species. A pronounced twisting of the body, called torsion, characterizes gastropod development. Among opisthobranchs, however, torsion is usually limited, or individuals “detort” at metamorphosis. As a result, the mantle cavity, when present, generally lies at the side or rear of the animal rather than at the front. Each individual opisthobranch is a simultaneous hermaphrodite—i.e., both male and female reproductive organs occur in one individual.
