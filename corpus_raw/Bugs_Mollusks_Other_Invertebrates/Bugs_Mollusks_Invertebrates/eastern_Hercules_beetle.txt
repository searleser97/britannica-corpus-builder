Eastern Hercules beetle,  (Dynastes tityus),  a large, easily recognized insect of the Dynastinae subfamily of the beetle family Scarabaeidae (order Coleoptera). The eastern Hercules beetle is closely related to the rhinoceros and elephant beetles. Hornlike structures on the thorax (region behind the head) and on the head of the male (usually lacking in the females) make it conspicuous. The eastern Hercules beetle is about 62 mm (2.4 inches) in length and is found in northern temperate regions. The function or evolutionary value of the horns is not yet known; they can give a strong pinch, however. The larvae can damage plant roots; adults usually live under rotting bark.
