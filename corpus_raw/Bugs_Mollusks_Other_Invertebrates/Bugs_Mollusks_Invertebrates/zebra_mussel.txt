zebra mussel,  a species of tiny mussels (genus Dreissena) that are prominent freshwater pests. They proliferate quickly and adhere in great numbers to virtually any surface. The voracious mussels disrupt food webs by wiping out phytoplankton, and their massive clustering on water-intake valves and pipes, bridge abutments, and other structures can cause severe commercial damage. They made their first known attack on Europe in the early 19th century and were carried (probably in ship water ballasts) to North America about 1986; their invasion of all the Great Lakes has had devastating effects on the lakesâ€™ native mussel and fish populations.
The quagga mussel (D. rostriformis burgensis), a similar species in both form and habit, was first discovered in the Great Lakes in 1989.
