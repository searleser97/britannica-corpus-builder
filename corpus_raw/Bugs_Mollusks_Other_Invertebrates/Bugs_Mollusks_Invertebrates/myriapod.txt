Myriapod,  any member of several closely related groups of the invertebrate phylum Arthropoda, including the extinct Archipolypoda, extant Diplopoda, or millipedes (see millipede), Chilopoda, or centipedes (see centipede), Pauropoda (see pauropod), and Symphyla (see symphylan). The myriapods are a little-known group, although some 11,000 living species have been recognized.
Most myriapods are seldom seen. Some attract attention by spectacular mass migration, while others are found occasionally in dark corners of houses and other buildings. Certain tropical species can inflict painful bites on humans if handled or accidentally encountered. The primary significance of myriapods is the role they play in the ecological balance of forested regions. In addition, their limited ability to migrate, their dependence upon stable conditions of moisture and shelter, and their general intolerance of seawater, together with the fact that they appeared rather early in geological history and have since evolved little, make the myriapods important indicators of land-water relationships. They can provide useful information for understanding evolution and geographic dispersal.
Because myriapods are largely phytosaprophagous (subsisting on dead plants), they play an important role in the breakdown of dead vegetable material. Some species are primarily carnivorous, however. Myriapods are most abundant and diverse in tropical and temperate forests, although some species of diplopods and an even greater number of chilopods thrive in grassland or semiarid habitats, and others live in desert conditions.
