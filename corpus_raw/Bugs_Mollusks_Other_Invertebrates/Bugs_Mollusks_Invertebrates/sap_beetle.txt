Sap beetle,  (family Nitidulidae),  any of at least 2,000 species of beetles (insect order Coleoptera) usually found around souring or fermenting plant fluids (e.g., decaying fruit, moldy logs, fungi). Sap beetles are about 12 mm (0.5 inch) or less in length and oval or elongated in shape. In some species the elytra (wing covers) cover the abdomen, while in others the tip of the abdomen is exposed. The picnic beetle (Glischrochilus fasciatus), a common North American species, is shiny black with two yellow-orange bands across the elytra.
