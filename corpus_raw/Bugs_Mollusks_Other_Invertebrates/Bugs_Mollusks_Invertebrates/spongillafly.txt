Spongillafly,  (family Sisyridae),  any of a group of insects (order Neuroptera) that are smoky brown in colour and resemble lacewings. Females deposit clusters of eggs under a silky web near or on the water. The larva lives as a parasite on a freshwater sponge. It leaves the water when fully grown and spins a double-walled, lacelike cocoon in which it passes the pupal stage. Spongillaflies are found throughout the world wherever there are freshwater sponges.
