Horseshoe shrimp,  any member of the marine crustacean subclass Cephalocarida (class Crustacea), named because of the curving, horseshoelike shape of the body. Only nine species are known, the first of which was described in 1955.
A very primitive group, the horseshoe shrimp have no eyes; in addition, appendages occur only on the thorax, or midsection. They are hermaphroditicâ€”i.e., functional reproductive organs of both sexes occur in the same individual. All are suspension feeders that use spines on their legs to collect food particles from the water.
Hutchinsoniella macracantha, which attains a length of 37 mm (1.5 inches), occurs on the Atlantic coast of the northeastern United States. Lightiella incisa, about 2.6 mm (0.10 inch) in length, is found in waters near Puerto Rico; L. serendipita, 3.2 mm (0.13 inch) long, occurs in San Francisco Bay on the coast of California. Sandersiella acuminata, 2.4 mm (0.094 inch) long, is found in waters near Japan and New Caledonia.
