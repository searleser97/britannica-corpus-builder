Raspy cricket,  any of a group of insects in the subfamily Gryllacridinae (order Orthoptera) that possess features similar to both crickets and katydids but are distinguished by the “raspy” noise that they produce as a defense response. Raspy crickets, along with the leaf-rolling grasshoppers (or wingless crickets), make up the family Gryllacrididae. Raspy crickets are found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, with the greatest number and diversity—more than 120 different species—occurring in Australia alone.
Raspy crickets are found in woodlands, grasslands, or wet forests. They typically remain in their nests during the day and forage for food at night. Raspy crickets appear to take advantage of whatever food is available to them, and their diet thus ranges from insects and other arthropods to plants and plant parts, including grasses, flowers, and seeds. On average, raspy crickets grow to a length of about 5 cm (2 inches), and they are usually gray to brown in colour, have long antennae, and are wingless.
Raspy crickets are further characterized by their ability to produce silk, which is used for nest construction. Some species weave silk linings within ground burrows, whereas others incorporate pieces of organic matter, such as leaves and sand, into the silk to create small shelters on the ground or in trees. The crickets display unique nest-locating ability, which enables each cricket to return to its own nest following nocturnal foraging excursions. This homing behaviour appears to depend largely on information provided by the detection of individualized pheromones and by the recognition of spatial landmarks.
Raspy crickets communicate by drumming their legs on their abdomens, by tapping their hind legs on plant stems, or by stomping their feet to produce vibration, which appears to play a role in courtship between males and females. When threatened, they send out alarm signals by using femoral-abdominal stridulation, in which the femur of a hind leg is rubbed across pegs on the abdomen. This produces the raspy noise for which they are named.
Among the more widely known raspy crickets are the Illawarra raspy cricket (Apotrechus illawarra), the Canberra raspy cricket (Cooraboorama canberrae), and the thick-legged raspy cricket (Ametrus tibialis). A species belonging to the genus Glomeremus is endemic to the wet forests on the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. This particular raspy cricket is known to act as a pollinator for the orchid Angraecum cadetii; it is the first orthopteran discovered to regularly pollinate flowering plants (angiosperms). The insect’s feeding behaviour, characterized by its primary dependence on nectar, seeds, and pollen, is believed to have evolved as a result of the relative shortage on the islands of arthropods, which make up a substantial part of the diets of raspy crickets found in Australia. The Mascarene raspy cricket carries pollinia of A. cadetii on its head, transferring the pollen grains to neighbouring flowers as it feeds.
