Schwarzlose machine gun,  early Austrian water-cooled machine gun (q.v.) operating on the blowback principle. A heavy breechlock and spring hold the bolt closed until the pressure has been reduced to a safe level. Then the fired cartridge case and bolt are blown to the rear against the main spring.
