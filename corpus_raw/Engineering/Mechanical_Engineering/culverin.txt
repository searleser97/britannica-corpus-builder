Culverin,   medieval cannon of relatively long barrel and light construction. It fired light (8–16-pound [3.6–7.3-kg]) projectiles at long ranges along a flat trajectory.
The culverin was adapted to field use by the French in the mid-15th century and to naval use by the English in the late 16th century. During the 17th century, cannons were classified according to the weight of projectiles fired, and the name culverin became obsolete.
