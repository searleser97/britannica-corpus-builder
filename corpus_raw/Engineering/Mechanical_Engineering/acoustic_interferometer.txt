Acoustic interferometer,   device for measuring the velocity and absorption of sound waves in a gas or liquid. A vibrating crystal creates the waves that are radiated continuously into the fluid medium, striking a movable reflector placed accurately parallel to the crystal source. The waves are then reflected back to the source. The strength of the standing wave pattern set up between the source and the reflector as the distance between source and reflector is varied, or as the frequency is varied, indicates the absorption by the medium. The velocity at which the waves travel may be determined from the distance between the peaks in the pattern of standing waves. This method has been brought to a high degree of accuracy and has been used for determining the characteristics of seawater for sonar applications.
