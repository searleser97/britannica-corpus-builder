Harquebus, also spelled arquebus, also called hackbut,  first gun fired from the shoulder, a smoothbore matchlock with a stock resembling that of a rifle. The harquebus was invented in Spain in the mid-15th century. It was often fired from a support, against which the recoil was transferred from a hook on the gun. Its name seems to derive from German words meaning “hooked gun.” The bore varied, and its effective range was less than 650 feet (200 m). The harquebus was superseded by the larger musket (q.v.) in the mid-16th century.
