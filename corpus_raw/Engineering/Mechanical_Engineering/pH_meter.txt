PH meter,  electric device used to measure hydrogen-ion activity (acidity or alkalinity) in solution. Fundamentally, a pH meter consists of a voltmeter attached to a pH-responsive electrode and a reference (unvarying) electrode. The pH-responsive electrode is usually glass, and the reference is usually a silver–silver chloride electrode, although a mercury–mercurous chloride (calomel) electrode is sometimes used. When the two electrodes are immersed in a solution, they act as a battery. The glass electrode develops an electric potential (charge) that is directly related to the hydrogen-ion activity in the solution (59.2 millivolts per pH unit at 25 °C [77 °F]), and the voltmeter measures the potential difference between the glass and reference electrodes.
