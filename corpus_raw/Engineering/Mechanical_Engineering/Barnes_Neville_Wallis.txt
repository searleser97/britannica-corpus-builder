Sir Barnes Wallis,  (born Sept. 26, 1887—died Oct. 30, 1979, Leatherhead, Surrey, Eng.), British aeronautical designer and military engineer who invented the innovative “dambuster” bombs used in World War II.
Wallis trained as a marine engineer before joining the airship (dirigible) department of Vickers Ltd. in 1913 as a designer. Eventually turning to aircraft, he employed his geodetic system in the Royal Air Force’s (RAF’s) Wellington bomber in World War II. His researches into detonation effects led to his inventing the rotating bouncing bomb that, when dropped from an aircraft, skipped over the water and exploded while sinking to the base of the retaining wall of a dam. This type of bomb, used during World War II by the RAF on the Möhne and Eder dams in Germany’s industrial Ruhr area, produced heavy floods that slowed industrial production.
Wallis produced not only the dambuster bombs but also the 12,000-pound “Tallboy” and the 22,000-pound “Grand Slam” bombs. He was also responsible for the bombs that destroyed the German warship Tirpitz, the V-rocket sites, and much of Germany’s railway system. Wallis was chief of aeronautical research and development at the British Aircraft Corporation at Weybridge, Surrey, from 1945 to 1971. In 1971 he designed an aircraft that could fly five times the speed of sound and needed a runway only 300 yards (275 metres) long; however, it was never built. He became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1954 and was knighted in 1968.
