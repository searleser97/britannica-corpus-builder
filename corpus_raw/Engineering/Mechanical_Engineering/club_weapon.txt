Club,  a heavy stick, sometimes with a stone or metal head, used as a hand or throwing weapon and usually shaped or selected with an outer end wider and heavier than its handle. Among traditional societies, special designs often characterize particular tribes. Police continue to employ narrow clubs known as truncheons, nightsticks, or billies in controlling prisoners and crowds. These are sometimes made with lead cores. See also mace.
