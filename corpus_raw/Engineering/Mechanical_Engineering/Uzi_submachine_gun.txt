Uzi submachine gun,  compact automatic weapon that is used throughout the world as a police and special-forces firearm. The Uzi is named for its designer, Uziel Gal, an Israeli army officer who developed it after the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. Gal based his weapon partly on earlier Czech designs, in which bullets were fed into the gunâ€™s chamber from a box-shaped magazine inserted into the pistol grip. The bullets were fired by a hollowed-out bolt that slid around much of the barrel as it shot forward. Gal combined these features to produce a gun that was easy to load, of unprecedented compactness, reasonably stable and accurate even when fired automatically, and extremely well-tooled and durable. The weapon was phased out by the Israeli army in 2003.
Issued in several designs, the standard Uzi is 650 mm (25.6 inches) long with its folding metal butt fully extended. The barrel is only 260 mm (10 inches) long. When loaded with a 25- or 32-round magazine of 9-mm pistol ammunition, the gun weighs about 4 kg (9 pounds). The Uzi has also been made in miniature versions that are as short as 460 mm (18 inches).
