thresher,  farm machine for separating wheat, peas, soybeans, and other small grain and seed crops from their chaff and straw. Primitive threshing methods involved beating by hand with a flail or trampling by animal hooves. An early threshing machine, patented in 1837 by Hiram A. and John A. Pitts of Winthrop, Maine, U.S., was operated by horsepower. Large stationary threshers powered by steam engines or tractors, common in the early part of the 20th century, were part of harvesting systems in which the grain was cut either by binders or by headers. In most farm regions, threshers, binders, and headers were all superseded by combines during the 20th century.
