William Cockerill,  (born 1759, Lancashire, Eng.—died  1832, Aachen, Prussia [Germany]), English inventor and manufacturer who brought the Industrial Revolution to present-day Belgium.
As a youth in England Cockerill revealed unusual mechanical ability by constructing models of a great number of machines. In 1794 he went to Russia as an artisan and two years later to Sweden to construct lock gates for its government, but he could not arouse interest in his own field of spinning machines. In 1799 he moved to Verviers, Fr., now in Liège province (Belgium), where, under contract to the firm of Simonis and Biolley, he constructed the first wool-carding and wool-spinning machines on the Continent. In 1807, with two of his sons, he opened factories in Liège for the construction of spinning and weaving machines, thus introducing an industry that previously had been an English monopoly. He retired in 1812.
