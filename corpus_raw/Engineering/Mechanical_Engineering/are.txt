Are,  unit of area in the metric system, equal to 100 square metres and the equivalent of 0.0247 acre. Its multiple, the hectare (equal to 100 ares), is the principal unit of land measurement for most of the world. The are was the basic unit of area when the metric system was first decreed in France in 1795. When the International System of Units (SI) was adopted in 1960, the square metre replaced the are as the unit of area, but the International Bureau of Weights and Measures has accepted the hectare as a commonly used unit that can be used with the SI.
