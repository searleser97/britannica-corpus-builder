Giuseppe Campani,  (born 1635, Castel San Felice [Italy]—died July 28, 1715, Rome, Papal States), Italian optical-instrument maker who invented a lens-grinding lathe.
Of peasant origin, Campani as a young man studied in Rome. There he learned to grind lenses and, with his two brothers, invented a silent night clock that, when presented to Pope Alexander VII, brought him fame. Thereafter, he became a full-time lens grinder for about 50 years, constructing telescopes and lenses for important persons and for the Royal Observatory in Paris. In 1664 he developed his lens-grinding lathe, with which he made superior lenses for telescopes. He also improved telescope tubes, constructing them of wood rather than of cardboard covered with leather; though somewhat unwieldy, these designs proved durable, and wooden telescopes continued in use until the 19th century. With his own instruments he observed the moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn in 1664–65. Subsequently, he devised a screw-barrel microscope that could be adjusted by rotating it within a threaded ring. That device supplanted sliding barrel types held only by friction, permitting far more precise adjustment.
