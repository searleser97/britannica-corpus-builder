Jean de Hautefeuille,  (born March 20, 1647, Orléans, France—died  Oct. 18, 1724, Orléans), French physicist who built a primitive internal-combustion engine.
Born of poor parents, Hautefeuille was reared by the Duchess of Bouillon and eventually took holy orders and became an abbé. He spent all his time in mechanical pursuits. He published works on acoustics, optics, tidal phenomena, and watch mechanisms. He also invented the micrometer microscope to measure the size of minute objects.
Hautefeuille’s internal-combustion engine was intended to operate a pump. The piston was first actuated by the ignition of a small charge of gunpowder and then returned to its initial position when the hot gases of combustion cooled, leaving a partial vacuum.
