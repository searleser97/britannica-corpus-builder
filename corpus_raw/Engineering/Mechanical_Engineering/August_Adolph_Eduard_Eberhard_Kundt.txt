August Kundt,  (born November 18, 1839, Schwerin, duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin [Germany]—died May 21, 1894, Israelsdorf, near Lübeck, Germany), German physicist who developed a method for determining the velocity of sound in gases and solids.
Kundt studied at the University of Leipzig but afterward went to the University of Berlin. In 1867 he became an instructor at Berlin, and in the following year he became professor of physics at the Zürich Polytechnic. In 1872 he was called to Strasbourg, where he was one of the founders of that city’s Physical Institute. In 1888 he succeeded to the chair of experimental physics and the directorship of the Berlin Physical Institute. In his experiments on sound, Kundt dusted the interior of a tube with a finely divided powder to show the position of the nodes of the sound waves, thereby determining their wavelength. He also studied the anomalous dispersion of light in liquids, vapours, and metals. In his work with magneto-optics, he showed the rotation, under magnetic influence, of the plane of polarization in certain gases and vapours.
