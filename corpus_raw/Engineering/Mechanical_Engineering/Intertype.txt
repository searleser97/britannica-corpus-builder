Intertype,  (trademark), typesetting machine similar to Linotype that sets type in full lines called slugs, long used to set newspaper copy. The Intertype machine incorporates a keyboard, a magazine that contains continuously reused type matrices, a casting mechanism, and a distribution system for returning used matrices to the magazine. Like Linotype machines, some Intertype machines are driven semiautomatically by means of perforated tape that indicates characters and spacing. Intertype, like Linotype, has to a large extent given way to photocomposition. Compare Linotype; photocomposition.
