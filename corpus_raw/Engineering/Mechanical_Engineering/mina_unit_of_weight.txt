Mina,  earliest of all known units of weight. It was created by the Babylonians and used by the Hittites, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Egyptians, Hebrews, and Greeks. Its weight and relationship to its major subdivisions varied at different times and places in the ancient world. In one surviving form, from the Babylonian period, the mina weighs about 640 grams (about 23 ounces), while in another it weighs 978 grams (about 34 ounces).
The mina, or minah, was a basic standard of weight among the ancient Hebrews. In the sacred system of weights, the sacred mina was equal to 60 shekels, and 60 sacred minas equaled 1 sacred talent. In the Talmudist system, 1 Talmudist mina equaled 25 shekels, and 60 Talmudist minas equaled 1 Talmudist talent. The Hebrew sacred mina has been estimated at 499 grams (about 18 ounces). The Greek, or Attic, mina, equal to 100 drachmas, has been estimated at 431 grams (about 15 ounces).
