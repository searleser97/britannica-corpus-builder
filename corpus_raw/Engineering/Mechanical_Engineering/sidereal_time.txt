Sidereal time,   time as measured by the apparent motion about the Earth of the distant, so-called fixed, stars, as distinguished from solar time, which corresponds to the apparent motion of the Sun. The primary unit of sidereal time is the sidereal day, which is subdivided into 24 sidereal hours, 1,440 sidereal minutes, and 86,400 sidereal seconds. Astronomers rely on sidereal clocks because any given star will transit the same meridian at the same sidereal time throughout the year. The sidereal day is almost 4 minutes shorter than the mean solar day of 24 of the hours shown by ordinary timepieces.
Sidereal time may be defined for any place on the Earth, but in the international system used by astronomers each sidereal day begins at the instant the vernal equinox transits the prime meridian. The vernal equinox is the point on the celestial sphere at which the Sun crosses the plane of the Equator, moving from south to north.
