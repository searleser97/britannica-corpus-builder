Sir David Gill,  (born June 12, 1843, Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scot.—died  Jan. 24, 1914, London, Eng.), Scottish astronomer known for his measurements of solar and stellar parallax, showing the distances of the Sun and other stars from Earth, and for his early use of photography in mapping the heavens. To determine the parallaxes, he perfected the use of the heliometer, a telescope that uses a split image to measure the angular separation of celestial bodies.
Gill was educated at the University of Aberdeen, and in 1872 he became director of James Ludovic Lindsay’s private observatory near Aberdeen. From there he undertook expeditions to Mauritius in 1874, to observe the transit of Venus, and to Ascension Island in 1877, when Mars was in opposition. His measurements of Mars’s position as it neared the Earth enabled him to roughly calculate the solar parallax. In 1888–89 he carried out, with the cooperation of many astronomers, a program of intensive observation of selected minor planets with the heliometer. This led to the first determination (1901) of the solar parallax with modern accuracy.
As royal astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope from 1879 to 1907, he photographed the sky within 19° of the south celestial pole in great detail. From these pictures, J.C. Kapteyn compiled the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung, a catalog of nearly 500,000 stars. Gill was knighted in 1900.
