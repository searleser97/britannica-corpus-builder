Elias Howe,  (born July 9, 1819, Spencer, Mass., U.S.—died  Oct. 3, 1867, Brooklyn, N.Y.), American inventor whose sewing machine helped revolutionize garment manufacture in the factory and in the home.
Interested in machinery since childhood, Howe learned the machinist trade and worked in a cotton machinery factory in Lowell, Mass., and later in Cambridge. During this time it was suggested to him that the man who invented a machine that could sew would earn a fortune. For five years Howe spent all his spare time in the development of a practical sewing machine, and in 1846 he was granted a patent for it. The machine attracted little attention in the United States at first, and, when a fortune was not forthcoming, Howe sold the patent rights in England for £250 ($1,250). He moved to England and worked for £5 a week to perfect his machine for use in sewing leather and similar materials. As his financial condition worsened, he managed to send his family back to the United States, but when he finally returned destitute, he found his wife dying. Years of disappointment and discouragement followed. He found that, while he had been abroad, sewing machines were being widely manufactured and sold in the United States in violation of his patent. After much litigation, his rights were finally established in 1854, and from then until 1867, when his patent expired, he received royalties on all sewing machines produced in the United States.
