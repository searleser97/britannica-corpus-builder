Dram,  unit of weight in the apothecaries’ and avoirdupois systems. An apothecaries’ dram contains 3 scruples (3.888 grams) of 20 grains each and is equal to one-eighth apothecaries’ ounce of 480 grains. The avoirdupois dram contains 27.344 grains (1.772 grams) and is equal to one-sixteenth avoirdupois ounce of 437 1/2 grains. The term also refers to the fluid dram, a measure of capacity equal to one-eighth fluid ounce.
In England dram came to mean a small draught of cordial or alcohol; hence the term dram-house for the taverns where one could purchase a dram. Dram is ultimately derived from Greek drachma, designating an ancient coin and weight that probably originated as the amount one could hold in one’s hands. The use of the dram as a measuring unit has largely been superseded by metric measures.
