Grid,  in an electron tube, an electrode that has openings for controlling the flow of electrons or ions through it. Unmodified, the term applies to a control grid that is ordinarily placed between the cathode and the anode (or plate) of an electron tube to vary the flow of current. A screen grid—usually maintained at a fixed potential—is placed between a control grid and an anode to reduce the electrostatic influence of the anode on the control grid. A suppressor grid is interposed between two positive electrodes—usually the screen grid and the anode—to reduce the flow of secondary electrons from one to the other.
