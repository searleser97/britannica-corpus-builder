Golden number,  in chronology, the position of a solar, or calendar, year within the 19-year Metonic cycle (q.v.) after which the phases of the Moon recur on the same dates. The sequence of golden numbers, used in fixing the date of Easter, begins at one at each year in which the New Moon occurs on January 1 (e.g., 1995 and 2014).
