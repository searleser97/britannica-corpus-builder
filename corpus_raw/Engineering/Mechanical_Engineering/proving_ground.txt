Proving ground,   area used for testing devices and equipment, usually, though not always, military. Testing, in general, has for its purpose the determination of the durability and probable life of a piece of equipment. the enforcement of standards through sample testing (for example, of ammunition), the discovery of weaknesses to be corrected, and the effects of operating a device under various conditions, including extremes of temperature and weather, difficult terrain, and excessive use.
Proving grounds for rockets and guided missiles are usually large and located in sparsely settled areas or on coasts or islands. Automotive proving grounds provide facilities for a number of tests of a vehicleâ€™s stamina and other characteristics, such as corduroy tracks to twist the car frame, steep slopes, broken stone, mud, and other hazardous ground, and tracks large enough to permit maneuvering at top speeds.
