Jean Richer,  (born 1630—died  1696, Paris, France), French astronomer whose observations of the planet Mars from Cayenne, French Guiana, in 1671–73 contributed to both astronomy and geodesy. The French government sent Richer to Cayenne to investigate atmospheric refraction at a site near the Equator, to observe the Sun to get a better value for the obliquity of the ecliptic, and especially to measure the parallax of Mars at its opposition. Comparison of Richer’s Mars observations with those made elsewhere made it possible to determine the distances of Mars and the Sun from Earth, leading to the first reasonably accurate calculation of the dimensions of the solar system and showing the system to be much larger than previously believed.
Richer’s observations also led to a discovery about Earth’s shape. Through experimentation, Richer discovered that the beat of a pendulum is slower at Cayenne than at Paris, which is at a different latitude. This meant that gravity must be weaker at Cayenne than at Paris. Sir Isaac Newton and Dutch mathematician Christiaan Huygens used this discovery to prove that the Earth is not a sphere but is actually flattened at the poles (an oblate spheroid). Thus, Cayenne is farther than Paris from Earth’s centre.
