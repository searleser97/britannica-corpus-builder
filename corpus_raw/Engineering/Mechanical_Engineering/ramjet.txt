Ramjet,  air-breathing jet engine that operates with no major moving parts. It relies on the craftâ€™s forward motion to draw in air and on a specially shaped intake passage to compress the air for combustion. After fuel sprayed into the engine has been ignited, combustion is self-sustaining. As in other jet engines, forward thrust is obtained as a reaction to the rearward rush of hot exhaust gases.
Ramjets work best at speeds of Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound) and higher. Since ramjets develop no static thrust, some means for launching them at high velocity is required.
The first aircraft to fly solely on ramjet power, the Leduc 0.10, was built in France and was launched from another airplane on April 21, 1949. Compare turbojet.
