Electric switch,   device for opening and closing electrical circuits under normal load conditions, usually operated manually. There are many designs of switches; a common type—the toggle, or tumbler, switch—is widely used in home lighting and other applications. The so-called mercury, or “silent,” switch is used extensively for controlling home lighting circuits. The oil switch has its live parts immersed in oil to reduce arcing. The aggregate of switching or circuit-breaking equipment for a power station or a transforming station, frequently located in an outdoor yard (switchyard) beside the station, is usually regarded as switchgear.
