computer numerical control (CNC),  in manufacturing, the control of a device, particularly machine tools, by direct input of data from a computer program. It is a principal element of computer-integrated manufacturing. CNC is also essential to the operation of industrial robots. CNC systems often receive their instructions from computer-aided design (CAD) programs. Two basic types of CNC systems are point-to-point, in which a device is programmed to perform a series of motions with fixed starting and stopping points, and continuous-path, in which a point-to-point programmed device has sufficient memory to be “aware” of its former actions and their results and to act in accordance with this information.
