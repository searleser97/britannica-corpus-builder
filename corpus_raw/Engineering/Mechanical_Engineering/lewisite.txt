Lewisite,   in chemical warfare, poison blister gas developed by the United States for use during World War I. Chemically, the substance is dichloro(2-chlorovinyl)arsine, a liquid whose vapour is highly toxic when inhaled or when in direct contact with the skin. It blisters the skin and irritates the lungs. Any part of the body that is contacted by the liquid or vapour suffers inflammation, burns, and tissue destruction. Lewisite was developed in retaliation for German gas attacks during World War I, but was never actually used. It was in the process of manufacture when the armistice was signed.
