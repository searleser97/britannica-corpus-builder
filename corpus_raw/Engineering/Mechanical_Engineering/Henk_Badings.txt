Henk Badings,  (born Jan. 17, 1907, Bandung, Java, Dutch East Indies [now in Indonesia]—died  June 26, 1987, Maarheeze, Neth.), Dutch composer, best known for his music featuring electronic sounds and the compositional use of tape recorders.
Born to Dutch parents, Badings was orphaned and went from Java to the Netherlands in 1915. At his guardian’s insistence, he studied geology, but he turned to music and began to compose, initially without any formal training. He later studied composition (1930–31) with Willem Pijper. After composing in nearly all traditional genres, he began in the 1950s to attract international attention for his electronic music and his pioneering work with tape recording. His later style was exemplified in such works as his radio operas of this period, notably Orestes (1954). Many of his works used electronic sounds in combination with conventional instruments. Badings was director (1941–45) of the Royal Conservatory at The Hague.
