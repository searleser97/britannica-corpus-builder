Ballista,  ancient missile launcher designed to hurl javelins or heavy balls. Ballistas were powered by torsion derived from two thick skeins of twisted cords through which were thrust two separate arms joined at their ends by the cord that propelled the missile. The much smaller carroballistae were of similar design but were sufficiently mobile that Roman legions took them into the field on carts. The largest ballistas were quite accurate in hurling 60-pound weights up to about 500 yards. Compare catapult.
