Candela (cd),  unit of luminous intensity in the International System of Units (SI), defined as the luminous intensity in a given direction of a source that emits monochromatic radiation of frequency 540 × 1012 hertz and has a radiant intensity in that same direction of 1/683 watt per steradian (unit solid angle). The candela has replaced the standard candle or lamp as a unit of luminous intensity in calculations involving artificial lighting and is sometimes called the “new candle.”
