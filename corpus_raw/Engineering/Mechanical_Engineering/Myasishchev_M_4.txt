Myasishchev M-4, also called (NATO designation) Bison,  Soviet long-range bomber, the first jet bomber in the strategic air force of the Soviet Union that was capable of reaching deep into the continental United States. It was produced by the Myasishchev design bureau under Vladimir Mikhailovich Myasishchev (1902â€“78); the first version was deployed in 1956. Powered by four turbojet engines, it had a top speed in level flight of about 900 km (550 miles) per hour, an operating ceiling above 12,500 metres (40,000 feet), and (with in-flight refueling) a combat range of up to 15,000 km (9,000 miles). The M-4 was manned by a crew of eight and carried a heavy defensive armament of 23-mm cannons in three turrets. Its primary offensive load was two nuclear bombs, but it could also carry up to 28 500-kg (1,100-pound) conventional bombs. The M-4 series had a troublesome production history and was quickly superseded as the principal Soviet long-range bomber by the Tupolev Tu-95. Production ceased in the early 1960s. Some planes remained in service as bombers through the 1980s, but most were converted to reconnaissance, refueling, and transport capabilities.
