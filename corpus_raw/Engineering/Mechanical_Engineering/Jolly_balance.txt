Jolly balance,   device, now largely obsolete, for determining the specific gravity (relative density) of solids and liquids. Invented by the 19th-century German physicist Philipp von Jolly, it consists in its usual form of a long, delicate, helical spring suspended by one end in front of a graduated scale. To the lower end of the spring is attached a weight pan and below that a small wire basket for samples. The difference in extension of the spring when the sample is suspended in air and in water represents the loss of weight in water; the weight in air divided by the loss of weight in water gives the specific gravity. The specific gravity of a liquid can be obtained by suspending any convenient specimen of a solid first in water and then in the liquid undergoing the test; the ratio of loss of weight of the solid in water and in the test liquid gives the specific gravity of the liquid.
