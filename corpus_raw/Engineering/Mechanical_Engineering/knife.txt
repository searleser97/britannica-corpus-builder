Knife,  tool or implement for cutting, the blade being either fixed to the handle or fastened with a hinge so as to clasp into it. Knives form the largest class of cutting implements known collectively as cutlery.
Cutting tools and weapons used for hunting and defense were first made from stones and flint and later of bronze and iron. The Romans taught the early Britons to work iron, and the Norman invaders are said to have brought with them smiths and metalworkers. Steel bladed eating knives dating from the Romano-British period have been excavated, but extremely few fine medieval knives with handles of precious or semiprecious material have survived; cleaning and grinding wore away the blades. Some of the early knives and weapons became famous for their perfection, among them the skilfully produced Toledo and Damascus blades.
In Europe, prior to the 17th century, only in the houses of the wealthy were there enough cutlery sets for knives to be offered to guests. Men typically carried a personal knife in a sheath attached to his belt or in a compartment on his sword scabbard. Women wore theirs attached to the girdle. In the later 17th century, services of silver cutlery in a house were sufficient to provide for guests. Although individual knives were no longer carried, a service including a knife, fork, spoon, and beaker was indispensable to the traveler and such sets were made until well into the 19th century. The characteristic 18th-century table knife has a pistol-shaped handle in which is mounted a curved blade of so-called “scimitar” form. With the modern stainless steel table knife, standard patterns have evolved in which practical needs and durability are the first considerations.
