Water frame,  In textile manufacture, a spinning machine powered by water that produced a cotton yarn suitable for warp (lengthwise threads). Patented in 1769 by R. Arkwright, it represented an improvement on James Hargreavesâ€™s spinning jenny, which produced weaker thread suitable only for weft (filling yarn).
