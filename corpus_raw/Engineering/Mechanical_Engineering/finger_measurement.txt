Finger,  ancient and medieval measure of 1/8yard, or 4 1/2inches (11.4 cm), used primarily to measure lengths of cloth. The finger derives ultimately from the digitus, the smallest of the basic Roman linear measures. From the digitus came the English nail, which equaled 3/4inch, or 1/16foot. The nail also came to mean the 16th part of a yard—2 1/4inches—as well as the 16th part of other measures. The one-nail length was also defined as the half finger, the length from the tip of the middle finger to the centre of the second joint from the tip. Thus, the finger became double the nail, or the length of the whole finger, tip to knuckle.
Leonardo da Vinci employed a “finger” measurement, but his was actually a finger’s breadth (0.75 inch). Four of da Vinci’s finger units equaled a palm, and six palms equaled a cubit.
