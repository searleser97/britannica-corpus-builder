Antiaircraft gun,   artillery piece that is fired from the ground or shipboard in defense against aerial attack. Antiaircraft weapons development began as early as 1910, when the airplane first became an effective weapon. In World War I, field artillery pieces up to about 90 mm (3.5 inches) in calibre were converted to antiaircraft use by mountings that enabled them to fire nearly vertically. Aiming methods were inadequate, however, and in the interwar decades great progress was made in the development of range finders, searchlights, time fuzes, and gunlaying mechanisms to help artillery pieces hit the rapidly moving targets presented by aircraft.
In World War II, rapid-firing and automatic antiaircraft guns were introduced, radar was applied to target tracking, and tiny radio-wave proximity fuzes exploded the ammunition as it approached the target. Against dive-bombers and low-level attack aircraft, a 40-millimetre (1.5-inch) gun, first produced by the Bofors firm of Sweden, was widely used by the British and U.S. forces. It fired 2-pound (0.9-kilogram) projectiles to a height of 2 miles (3.2 km) at 120 rounds per minute. The Soviets based their 37-millimetre weapon on this gun. Heavier antiaircraft guns, up to 120 mm, were used against high-flying bombers. The most effective of these was the German 88-millimetre Fliegerabwehrkanone; its abbreviated name, flak, became a universal term for antiaircraft fire.
In 1953 the U.S. Army introduced the Skysweeper, a 75-millimetre automatic cannon firing 45 shells per minute, aimed and fired by its own radar-computer system. With the introduction of guided surface-to-air missiles in the 1950s and â€™60s, heavy antiaircraft guns such as this were phased out, though radar-guided automatic guns of 20 to 40 mm continued to provide a defense against low-flying aircraft and helicopters.
