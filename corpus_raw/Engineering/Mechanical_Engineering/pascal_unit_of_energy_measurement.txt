Pascal (Pa),  unit of pressure and stress in the metre-kilogram-second system (the International System of Units [SI]). It was named in honour of the French mathematician-physicist Blaise Pascal (1623â€“62). A pascal is a pressure of one newton per square metre, or, in SI base units, one kilogram per metre per second squared. This unit is inconveniently small for many purposes, and the kilopascal (kPa) of 1,000 newtons per square metre is more commonly used. For example, standard atmospheric pressure (or 1 atm) is defined as 101.325 kPa. The millibar, a unit of air pressure often used in meteorology, is equal to 100 Pa. (For comparison, one pound per square inch equals 6.895 kPa.)
