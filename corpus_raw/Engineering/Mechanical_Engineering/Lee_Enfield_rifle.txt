Lee-Enfield rifle,   rifle adopted by the British army as its basic infantry weapon in 1902. The short, magazine-loaded Lee-Enfield (Mark I, or SMLE) superseded the longer Lee-Enfield that was first produced in 1895. The short rifle had a length of 44.5 inches (111.6 cm) and combined the bolt action devised by the Scots-American James P. Lee and the rifling standard at the British arsenal at Enfieldâ€”i.e., five grooves with a leftward twist. It fired .303-calibre ammunition with a rimmed cartridge carried in a 10-round box magazine. The magazine could also be loaded with five-round clips or single rounds. Though less accurate than the Springfield rifle at longer ranges, the Lee-Enfield could hold twice the number of cartridges and was capable of a faster rate of fire. The various models of Lee-Enfield rifles were the standard weapons of British infantry troops in both World Wars I and II.
