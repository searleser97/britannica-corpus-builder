Belt drive,   in machinery, a pair of pulleys attached to usually parallel shafts and connected by an encircling flexible belt (band) that can serve to transmit and modify rotary motion from one shaft to the other. Most belt drives consist of flat leather, rubber, or fabric belts running on cylindrical pulleys or of belts with a V-shaped cross section running on grooved pulleys. To create an effective frictional grip on the pulleys, belts must be installed with a substantial tension. Because of the wedging action of the belts in the grooves, V belts require less tension than do flat belts and are particularly suitable for connecting shafts that are close together. Flat and V belts slip when overloaded, and in some applications this condition may be more desirable than a rigid drive because it limits the transmitted torque and may prevent breakage of parts.
When flat belts are used to connect nonparallel shafts, the pulleys are located in such a way that the belt does not run off the pulleys; in some cases it may be necessary to use additional, or idler, pulleys to guide the belt. With an open flat belt, both shafts rotate in the same direction; with a crossed belt they rotate in opposite directions.
Another type of belt used on some internal-combustion engines for connecting the crankshaft and camshafts is the toothed, or timing, belt. This is a flat belt with evenly spaced transverse teeth that fit in matching grooves on the periphery of the pulley. The positive drive these belts provide has many advantages but lacks overload protection.
