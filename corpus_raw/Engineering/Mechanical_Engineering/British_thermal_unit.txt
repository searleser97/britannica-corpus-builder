British thermal unit (BTU),  a measure of the quantity of heat, defined since 1956 as approximately equal to 1,055 joules, or 252 gram calories. It was defined formerly as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water 1Â° F. The definition was changed because it was dependent on the initial temperature of the water. Gas utilities frequently use a larger unit, the therm, defined as 100,000 BTU, as a measure of gas consumption.
