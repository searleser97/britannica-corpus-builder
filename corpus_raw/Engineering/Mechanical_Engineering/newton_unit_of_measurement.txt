Newton,  absolute unit of force in the International System of Units (SI units), abbreviated N. It is defined as that force necessary to provide a mass of one kilogram with an acceleration of one metre per second per second. One newton is equal to a force of 100,000 dynes in the centimetre-gram-second (CGS) system, or a force of about 0.2248 pound in the foot-pound-second (English, or customary) system. The newton was named for Sir Isaac Newton, whose second law of motion describes the changes that a force can produce in the motion of a body.
