Air gun,   weapon based on the principle of the primitive blowgun that shoots bullets, pellets, or darts by expansion of compressed air.
Most modern air guns are inexpensive BB guns (named for the size of the shot fired). The best of these develop about half the muzzle velocity of light firearms, are accurate enough for marksmanship training at ranges up to 100 feet (30 m), and can kill small game. Darts with tranquilizing drugs may be fired to immobilize animals for handling or capture. An air-gun projectile seldom carries beyond 300 feet (92 m).
Early weapons had a reservoir of compressed air that, when suddenly released by a trigger, projected a single bullet or charge of shot with limited range and accuracy. During the 16th century a spring was substituted for the reservoir. When the trigger released the spring, the latter actuated a piston that compressed air which in turn drove the missile through the bore or barrel of the gun. This is the principle used in most air “rifles,” and it can also be used in air pistols.
Later weapons were constructed on the older principle of a reservoir, but these use cylinders of compressed gas, usually carbon dioxide. A single cylinder will give a number of shots before replacement is necessary; gas guns are comparable in power and accuracy to air guns.
