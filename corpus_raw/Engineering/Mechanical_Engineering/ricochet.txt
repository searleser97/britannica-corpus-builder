Ricochet,  in gunnery, rebound of a projectile that strikes a hard surface, or the rebounding projectile itself. At one time a form of fire known as ricochet was widely used; artillery was aimed to permit the shot to strike and rebound in a succession of skips. The invention of this type of fire in the late 17th century, usually attributed to the French military engineer SÃ©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, greatly influenced both sieges and field operations. A shot could be aimed to skip over lines of fortification and reach areas immune from direct fire. During World War II, ricochet fire was occasionally used with delayed-action fuses so that airbursts occurred after initial impact.
In modern rifle shooting, the word ricochet is applied only to the graze of a bullet that has struck short. A modern bullet that has ricocheted can inflict a large and irregular wound because it is no longer spinning on its long axis but wobbling erratically at high velocity.
