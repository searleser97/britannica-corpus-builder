Ole Evinrude,  (born April 19, 1877, Norway—died  July 12, 1934, Milwaukee), Norwegian-American inventor of the first commercially successful outboard marine internal-combustion engine.
Evinrude began work on this project in 1906 and by 1909 had developed a one-cylinder power plant rated at 1.5 horsepower. Subsequent outboard motors followed his transmission design, which used a vertical drive shaft with bevel gears (a set of two wheellike gears the teeth of which engage at an angle). In 1910 he founded Evinrude Motors in Milwaukee; renamed Outboard Motor Corporation, the firm was merged with Johnson Motor Company in 1936 to form the Outboard Marine Corporation. The inventor’s son Ralph Evinrude (1907–1986) was the chief organizer and first president of the new corporation.
