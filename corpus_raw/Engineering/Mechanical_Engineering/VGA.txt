VGA, in full Video Graphics Array,  computer chipset standard for displaying colour graphics. With the widespread availability of high-definition monitors, VGA was supplanted by HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface).
Introduced by IBM in 1987 for its PS/2 line of PCs, the original VGA chipset, or graphics card, offered the then-breakthrough capability to display up to 16 colours at a screen resolution of 640 × 480 pixels (picture elements)—a colour depth of 4 bits per pixel. At the lower resolution of 320 × 200 pixels, VGA could display up to 256 colours. VGA also offered improved rendering of text, particularly lowercase characters that drop below the display line, such as the letter g.
Although IBM and other manufacturers soon produced graphics cards that could display thousands to millions of colours, VGA remained a low-level default for many years, natively supported by all PCs, and the initial mode that operating systems (OS) loaded. For example, Microsoft Corporation’s Windows OS loaded its iconic opening splash screen in VGA colour. The standard also was commonly used for Windows’ diagnostic “safe mode,” which provides a basic display while leaving graphics cards inactive during troubleshooting.
VGA’s 15-pin connector served as the standard analog PC display adapter for more than two decades and remained as a legacy input even after the advent of digital monitors and digital visual interface (DVI). Long after PC graphics had evolved beyond VGA’s limitations, its display specifications were still used for the smaller screens of many handheld devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile telephones.
