Caliper, also spelled calliper,  measuring instrument that consists of two adjustable legs or jaws for measuring the dimensions of material parts. The calipers on the right side of the illustration have an adjusting screw and nut and are known as spring calipers, while those on the left are an illustration of firm-joint calipers, which are held in place by friction at the joint. Outside calipers measure thicknesses and outside diameters of objects; inside calipers measure hole diameters and distances between surfaces. To check the dimensions of a machined part, the calipers are first adjusted to the required dimension on a ruler or a standard plug or hole gauge; accuracy in calipering depends in large part on the sense of touch of the operator.
A hermaphrodite caliper has one leg bent inward and one straight leg ending in a sharp point; this type of caliper is used for scribing lines at a specified distance from a flat or curved surface.
