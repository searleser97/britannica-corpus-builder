Royal Armouries, also called National Museum of Arms and Armour,  in the United Kingdom, a collection of weapons and armour that was originally situated in the White Tower at the Tower of London.
The Royal Armouries has been an integral part of the Tower of London since William I the Conqueror in the 11th century ordered it to be built. Paying visitors were allowed access to the site from the late 16th century. Its development as a museum, however, largely dates to the reign of Charles II (1660–85), when the public was admitted on payment of a fee. At that time visitors could view specially prepared displays such as the "Spanish Armoury," comprising weapons and instruments of torture reputed to have come from the defeated Spanish Armada in 1588. Another exhibit was the "Line of Kings," which showed some of the armour of successive sovereigns, mounted on wooden dummies and horses that had been carved by such well-known artists as Grinling Gibbons and John van Nost. Re-creations of these exhibits can be seen today.
The Royal Armouries’ entire collection has become a key source for comparative study of the world’s arms and armour. Much of the collection is now displayed at the Royal Armouries Museum, Leeds (opened 1996), and the Royal Armouries Museum of Artillery at Fort Nelson, Fareham, near Portsmouth (opened 1988). The displays in the White Tower, renewed from 1997, tell the story of the Tower as a fortress and trace the development of the Royal Armouries and other government institutions that have operated there. In addition to the armour of the kings of England, some of the finest examples of arms and armour made over the past millennium can be seen.
