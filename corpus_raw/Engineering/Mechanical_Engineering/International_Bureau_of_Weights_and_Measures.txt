International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM),  French Bureau International des Poids et Mesures,  international organization founded to bring about the unification of measurement systems, to establish and preserve fundamental international standards and prototypes, to verify national standards, and to determine fundamental physical constants. The bureau was established by a convention signed in Paris on May 20, 1875, effective January 1876. In 1921 a modified convention was signed.
The convention provides for a General Conference that meets every four years to consider required improvements or modifications in standards. An International Committee of Weights and Measures, composed of 18 scientists elected by the conference, meets annually to monitor worldwide uniformity in units of measure. The bureau headquarters at SÃ¨vres, France, serves as a depository for the primary international standards and as a laboratory for certification and comparison of national standard copies.
