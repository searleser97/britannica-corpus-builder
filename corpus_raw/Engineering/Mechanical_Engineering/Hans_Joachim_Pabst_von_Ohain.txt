Hans Joachim Pabst von Ohain,  (born Dec. 14, 1911, Dessau, Ger.—died March 13, 1998, Melbourne, Fla., U.S.), German designer of the first operational jet engine.
After obtaining his doctorate at the University of Göttingen, he became a junior assistant to Hugo von Pohl, director of the Physical Institute there. When the German aircraft builder Ernst Heinkel asked the university for assistance in design, Pohl recommended Ohain, who joined Heinkel’s manufacturing firm in 1936. Ohain’s experiments, carried out in secret at Heinkel’s factory, resulted in a bench test by 1937 and a fully operational jet aircraft, the He 178, by 1939. This plane made the world’s first jet-powered aircraft flight on Aug. 27, 1939. Ohain’s centrifugal-flow turbojet engine, the HeS 3B, performed perfectly, though the landing gear of the plane failed to retract, preventing the test pilot from accelerating to planned speed.
Ohain continued his work, developing an improved engine, the HeS 8A, which was first flown on April 2, 1941. Ohain’s engine design, which used a centrifugal compressor, was inherently less efficient than one using an axial-flow compressor, and it was a turbojet of this type, designed by Anselm Franz, that powered the Me 262, the world’s first operational jet fighter aircraft. Ohain’s engines, by comparison, saw little use in World War II. After the war Ohain resettled in the United States, where he worked on jet aircraft for the U.S. Air Force.
