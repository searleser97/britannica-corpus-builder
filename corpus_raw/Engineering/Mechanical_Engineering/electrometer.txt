Electrometer,   instrument designed to measure very small voltages and currents. The quadrant, Lindermann, Hoffman, and Wulf electrometers measure electrical potential between charged elements (e.g., plates or fine quartz fibres) within the housings of the electrometer. The sensitivity of these instruments is about 0.01 volt.
A much more sensitive device is the vacuum-tube electrometer, a direct-current amplifier capable of measuring currents as minute as 10-15 amperes (about 10,000 electrons per second). This instrument, however, is subject to drift. A newer version of this type of electrometer replaces the electron tube with a matched pair of junction field-effect transistors. To aid in stabilizing the output-signal voltage, some of these devices are operated at temperatures approaching absolute zero (-459.67° F [-273.15° C]).
The vibrating-reed electrometer uses a capacitor that has a vibrating reed as one of its plates. Movement of the reed changes the voltage across the capacitor. The output of the electrometer (which is easily amplified without drift) is the current necessary to keep the meter’s capacitance constant.
Uses of electrometers include studying the ionizing effects of cosmic rays, determining absorption spectra in chemical analysis, and counting ions in gas chromatography.
