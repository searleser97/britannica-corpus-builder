Intermediate-range nuclear weapons,  Class of nuclear weapons with a range of 620–3,400 mi (1,000–5,500 km). Some multiple warheads developed by the Soviet Union could strike several targets anywhere in Western Europe in less than 10 minutes. The U.S. could send a single nuclear warhead from central Europe to Moscow in less than 10 minutes. Both were regarded as offensive, first-strike weapons. U.S.-Soviet arms-control negotiations (1980–87) led to the intermediate nuclear forces (INF) treaty, signed by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan, to completely remove and dismantle these and shorter-range weapons.
