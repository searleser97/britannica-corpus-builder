Jacques Besson,  (born 1540, Grenoble, Fr.—died  1576, Orléans), engineer whose improvements in the lathe were of great importance in the development of the machine-tool industry and of scientific instrumentation.
Besson’s designs, published in his illustrated treatise Theatrum instrumentorum (1569), introduced cams and templates (patterns used to guide the form of a piece being made) to the screw-cutting lathe, thus increasing the operator’s mechanical control of tool and workpiece and permitting the production of more accurate and intricate work in metal. He also improved the drive and feed mechanism of the ornamental lathe and described a more efficient form of waterwheel, considered a prototype of the water turbine.
