Air brake,   either of two kinds of braking systems. The first, used by railroad trains, trucks, and buses, operates by a piston driven by compressed air from reservoirs connected to brake cylinders. When air pressure in the brake pipe is reduced, air is automatically admitted into the brake cylinder. The first practical air brake for railroads was invented by George Westinghouse (q.v.) in the 1860s.
The term is also used to refer to the braking system used by aircraft and race cars. This brake consists of a flap or surface that can be mechanically projected into the airstream to increase the resistance of the vehicle to air and lower its speed.
