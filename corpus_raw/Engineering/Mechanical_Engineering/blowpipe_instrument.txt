Blowpipe,   a small tubular instrument for directing a jet of air or other gas into a flame in order to concentrate and increase the flame’s heat. A blowpipe is usually operated directly by mouth, but a small bellows may also be used.
In mineralogy, the blowpipe technique for analyzing ores was developed by the Swedish mineralogist Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt. Its application in qualitative analysis was due to the work of the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius and the German mineralogist Johann Hausmann. By placing a substance in the flame of a blowpipe, information may be obtained as to its general nature by the changes it undergoes during heating and by the residue that remains. By treating the residue with certain reagents and again heating, specific information as to certain elements may be obtained.
