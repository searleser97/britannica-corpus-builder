Toggle mechanism,   combination of solid, usually metallic links (bars), connected by pin (hinge) joints that are so arranged that a small force applied at one point can create a much larger force at another point. In the Figure, showing a toggle mechanism at work in a rock-crushing machine, the numbered links are pin-connected at A, B, C, D, and E. Rotation of link 1 about the fixed pivot A causes the block to slide back and forth. The relation between the force in link 2 acting at C and the force W exerted on the block at D, and thus on the rock, depends on the angle symbolized by the Greek letter theta, θ; the smaller the angle, the greater is W in terms of F. For θ equal to one degree, W is nearly 29 times F. Toggle mechanisms are used to obtain large force amplification in such applications as sheet metal punching and forming machines. See also linkage.
