Depth finder, also called echo sounder,  device used on ships to determine the depth of water by measuring the time it takes a sound (sonic pulse) produced just below the water surface to return, or echo, from the bottom of the body of water. Sonic depth finders are in operation on practically every important class of ship, naval and merchant, and are also used on small craft.
Sonic pulses are also sent out to detect underwater objects by the same principle. During World War II the name sonar (q.v.) was applied in an analogy to radar, and the device was used extensively to detect submarines. In addition to protecting ships from shoal water, peacetime uses include locating fish, measuring the thickness of ice in Arctic regions, and oceanographic charting. Sonic depth finders can be operated repetitively, recording thousands of soundings per hour, to prepare a profile of the ocean floor. Hydrographers use echo sounders in charting the oceans and in survey work to discover underwater pinnacles and shoals.
One of the first practical depth sounders, the so-called Hayes sonic depth finder, developed by the U.S. Navy in 1919, consisted of (1) a device to generate and send sound waves to the ocean floor and receive the reflected waves and (2) a timer calibrated at the speed of sound in seawater that directly indicated water depth. About 1927 a similar device was manufactured under the trade name Fathometer. The basic principles used in these early devices have not been significantly changed.
In the modern system a transmitter supplies a powerful pulse of electrical energy, and a transducer converts the pulse into an acoustical pressure wave in the water and receives its echo, converting it back into electrical energy, which can be amplified and applied to an indicator. Audible frequencies of less than 15 kilohertz are commonly employed.
