Key,   in machine construction, a device used to prevent rotation of a machine component, such as a gear or a pulley, relative to the shaft on which it is mounted. A common type of key is a square bar that fits half in a groove (keyway) in the shaft and half in an adjoining keyway in the component. If the shaft and the key are of the same material, a key with a width and depth equal to one fourth of the shaft diameter will have the same torque capacity as the solid shaft if its length is 1.57 times the shaft diameter. These proportions are closely approximated in practice.
