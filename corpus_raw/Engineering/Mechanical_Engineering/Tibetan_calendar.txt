Tibetan calendar,   dating system based on a cycle of 60 Tibetan years, each of which usually has 354 days (12 cycles of the phases of the Moon). Adjustment to the solar year of about 365 days is made by intercalation of an extra month every three years. The 60-year cycle appears to be a 9th-century adaptation from the Chinese calendar (q.v.). 
The written Tibetan calendar calls for an ideal month of 30 days; to reconcile this with the 29 1/2-day cycle of phases of the Moon, the number of days in six of the months is reduced to 29. The first day of each month coincides with the New Moon and the 15th day with the Full Moon.
