Beacon,  signalling object or device that indicates geographical location or direction to ships or aircraft by transmitting special radio signals, or a conspicuous object, either natural or artificial. It is a visible mark from a distance by day and, if lighted, at night. The term is also applied to a watchtower or signal station. Marker beacons used to assist mariners are erected on small islands, isolated rocks, reefs, shoals, and at suitable positions on the coastline. They are also used to mark the limits of the fairway in harbours, estuaries, and rivers. Rotating light beacons mark airports at night and during periods of low visibility.
