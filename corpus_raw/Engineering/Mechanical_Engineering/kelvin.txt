Kelvin (K),  base unit of thermodynamic temperature measurement in the International System of Units (SI). The 2018 General Conference on Weights and Measures decided that effective from May 20, 2019, the unit would be defined such that the Boltzmann constant would be equal to 1.380649 × 10−23 joule per kelvin. This unit was originally defined as 100/27,316 of the triple point (equilibrium among the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases) of pure water. The kelvin is also the fundamental unit of the Kelvin scale, an absolute temperature scale named for the British physicist William Thomson (known as Lord Kelvin). An absolute temperature scale has as its zero point absolute zero (−273.15° on the Celsius temperature scale and −459.67° on the Fahrenheit temperature scale), the theoretical temperature at which the molecules of a substance have the lowest energy; hence, all values on such a scale are nonnegative. Many physical laws and formulas can be expressed more simply when an absolute temperature scale is used; accordingly, the Kelvin scale has been adopted as the international standard for scientific temperature measurement. The difference between the freezing and boiling points of water is 100 degrees in both the Kelvin and Celsius scales; thus, the Kelvin degree has the same magnitude as the Celsius degree.
