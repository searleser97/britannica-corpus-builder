MiG,   any member of a family of Soviet military fighter aircraft produced by a design bureau founded in 1939 by Artem Mikoyan (M) and Mikhail Gurevich (G). (The i in MiG is the Russian word meaning “and.”)
The early MiG aircraft were propeller-driven fighters produced in moderate numbers during World War II. The MiG-9, which first flew in 1946, did little more than apply jet propulsion to a piston-engine airframe; but the MiG-15, built with swept-back wings derived from German wartime research and powered by a copy of a Rolls-Royce engine, became one of the best of the early jet fighters. This single-seat, single-engine plane was first flown in 1947 and saw extensive combat in the Korean War. An improved version, the MiG-17, first flown in 1950, shared its maneuverability and was used as a defensive interceptor by North Vietnam in the Vietnam War during the 1960s and as a fighter-bomber by Egypt and Syria in the Arab-Israeli War of 1973. Twin engines made the MiG-19, first flown in 1953, the first supersonic fighter of European manufacture, but it was surpassed in 1955 by the MiG-21, a lightweight, single-engine interceptor capable of flying at twice the speed of sound. The basic version, which entered service in 1958, was a simple, low-cost day fighter that was highly maneuverable, easy to maintain, and able to operate from unimproved airfields. It became the principal high-altitude interceptor used by North Vietnam, and improved versions formed the backbone of Arab air forces through the 1970s.
The MiG-23, which entered active service in 1972, featured a variable-sweep wing intended to improve performance at various speeds and altitudes. It also introduced electronic sensor and warning systems of increasing sophistication that allowed successive MiG fighters to find and attack aircraft at greater ranges and against cluttered radar returns from the ground. A ground-attack version of the MiG-23, with armoured cockpit and more weapons stores, was known as the MiG-27. In response to U.S. experiments with high-altitude, supersonic bombers, the MiG-25 was designed about 1960. As introduced in 1970, this twin-engine interceptor, the fastest combat aircraft ever in active service, registered speeds of Mach 2.7 and 2.8, with an operational ceiling above 24,400 m (80,000 feet). These abilities also made it useful for reconnaissance. The MiG-31, a two-seat interceptor introduced in 1983, is based on the MiG-25 but is modified for less speed and better performance at lower altitudes. The MiG-29, first operational in 1985, is a single-seat, twin-engine air-to-air fighter that can also be used for ground attack.
Variants of most MiG jets except the MiG-23 and MiG-25 were also produced outside the Soviet Union in such countries as China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and India.
