Pike,  medieval infantry weapon, a long spear with a heavy wooden shaft 10 to 20 feet (3 to 6 metres) long, tipped by a small leaf-shaped steel point. The ancient Macedonian sarissa was similar. The use of the pike among the Swiss foot soldiers in the 14th century contributed to the decline of the feudal knights. It disappeared from land warfare with the introduction of the bayonet, though it was retained in shortened form as a naval boarding weapon through the 19th century. A variety of pike is used by the picador in bullfighting.
