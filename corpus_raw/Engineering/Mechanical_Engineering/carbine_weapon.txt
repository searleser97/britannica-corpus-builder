Carbine,   light, short-barrelled musket or rifle. The word, the source of which is obscure, seems to have originated in the late or mid-16th century. The carbine, in various versions corresponding to the different full-sized military arms, was chiefly a cavalry weapon until the 18th century. Then some unmounted officers, artillerymen, and other specialists began to carry carbines. By the 1980s the trend toward general use of light assault rifles (e.g., the Soviet AK-47 or the U.S. M16) was making the carbine obsolete as a military weapon. However, its light weight and short length had long made it a popular sporting arm for hunting in heavy brush and also as a scabbard weapon for horseback use.
