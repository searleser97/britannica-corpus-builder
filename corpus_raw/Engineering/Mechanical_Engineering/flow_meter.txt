Flow meter,  Device that measures the velocity of a gas or liquid. It has applications in medicine as well as in chemical engineering, aeronautics, and meteorology. Examples include pitot tubes, venturi tubes, and rotameters (tapered graduated tubes with a float inside that is supported by the flowing fluid at a level that depends on the flow rate). Ultrasonic flow meters, in which reflecting ultrasound off a flowing liquid leads to a Doppler shift (see Doppler effect) that is calibrated to provide the flow rate of the liquid, have important industrial applications and have also been used to measure arterial blood flow.
