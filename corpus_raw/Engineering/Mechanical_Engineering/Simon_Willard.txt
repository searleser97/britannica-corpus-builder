Simon Willard,  (born April 3, 1753, Grafton, Massachusetts, U.S.—died August 30, 1848, Roxbury, Massachusetts), famous American clock maker. Willard was the creator of the timepiece that came to be known as the banjo clock, and he was the most celebrated of a family of Massachusetts clock makers who designed and produced brass-movement clocks between 1765 and 1850.
About 1780 Willard moved from Grafton, where he had been apprenticed to a clock maker, and settled in Roxbury, near Boston, where he continued studies with his brother Benjamin (1743–1803). Simon Willard worked in Roxbury until his retirement in 1839. He catered to a wealthy clientele, including Thomas Jefferson, who commissioned a clock for the University of Virginia. Willard made various types of clocks but specialized in pieces for churches, halls, and galleries. It is believed that he concentrated on producing accurate, simple movements and that the cases for his clocks were made by others.
On February 8, 1802, Willard patented an eight-day pendulum clock housed in a case having a round top portion bearing the dial, an elongated central portion, and a rectangular base. The shape of the upper part of the case inspired the term banjo clock, a name Willard did not use. Other items patented by Willard include a device for roasting meat, operated by a clock mechanism (1784), and an alarm clock (1819).
Willard’s brother Benjamin began manufacturing clocks in Grafton about 1765 and was known for the quality of his longcase clocks (a style later called grandfather clock). Another brother, Ephraim (1755–1805?), apparently worked with Benjamin. The youngest brother, Aaron (1757–1844), also a clock maker, worked in Roxbury until 1790, when he established a prosperous business in Boston, producing various types of clocks including banjo styles usually having painted lower panels.
Simon’s son, Simon, Jr. (1795–1874), worked with his father for two years and then set up in Boston following an apprenticeship in New York. Aaron’s son, also named Aaron (1783–1864), worked as a clock maker, succeeding to his father’s business and continuing until about 1850.
