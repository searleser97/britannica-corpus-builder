Eccentric-and-rod mechanism,   arrangement of mechanical parts used to obtain a reciprocating straight-line motion from a rotating shaft; it serves the same purpose as a slider-crank mechanism and is particularly useful when the required stroke of the reciprocating motion is small in comparison with the dimensions of the driving shaft. In the figure, the eccentric disk 2 is fixed off centre to the rotating shaft at A and has an eccentricity AB. The strap and rod 3 consist of two pieces clamped together in a sliding fit in a groove on the periphery of the disk. The rod is connected to the piston 4 within a housing 1. As the eccentric rotates with the shaft, it slides inside the strap, and the piston 4 moves on a straight path of length 2AB. AB is equivalent to the crankshaft and BC is equivalent to the connecting rod of a slider-crank mechanism. Because an eccentric can be attached anywhere along a shaft it is unnecessary to form any part of the shaft into a crank. Eccentrics are seldom used to transmit large forces because friction loss would be high; they are commonly used to drive the valve gears of engines.
