Lunar calendar,  any dating system based on a year consisting of synodic months—i.e., complete cycles of phases of the Moon. In every solar year (or year of the seasons) there are about 12.37 synodic months. Therefore, if a lunar-year calendar is to be kept in step with the seasonal year, a periodic intercalation (addition) of days is necessary.
The Sumerians were probably the first to develop a calendar based entirely on the recurrence of lunar phases. Each Sumero-Babylonian month began on the first day of visibility of the new Moon. Although an intercalary month was used periodically, intercalations were haphazard, inserted when the royal astrologers realized that the calendar had fallen severely out of step with the seasons. Starting about 380 bce, however, fixed rules regarding intercalations were established, providing for the distribution of seven intercalary months at designated intervals over 19-year periods. The Greek astronomer Meton of Athens followed the Babylonian precedent of having 7 years out of 19 having an intercalary month, which is known as the Metonic cycle.
Lunar calendars remain in use among certain religious groups today. The Jewish calendar, which supposedly dates from 3,760 years and three months before the Christian era (bce), is one example. The Jewish religious year begins in autumn and consists of 12 months alternating between 30 and 29 days. It allows for a leap year by following the Metonic cycle with an intercalary month in 7 years out of 19. Another lunar calendar, the Islamic, dates from the Hijrah—July 15,  622 ce, the day on which the Prophet Muhammad began his migration from Mecca to Medina. It makes no effort to keep calendric and seasonal years together.
