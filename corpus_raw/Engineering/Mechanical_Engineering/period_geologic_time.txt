Period,   in geology, the basic unit of the geologic time scale; during these spans of time specific systems of rocks were formed. Originally, the sequential nature of defining periods was a relative one, originating from the superposition of corresponding stratigraphic sequences and the evidence derived from paleontological studies. With the advent of radiometric dating methods, absolute ages for various periods can be determined.
