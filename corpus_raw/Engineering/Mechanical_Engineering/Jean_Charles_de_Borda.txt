Jean-Charles de Borda,  (born May 4, 1733, Dax, France—died  February 20, 1799, Paris), French mathematician and nautical astronomer noted for his studies of fluid mechanics and his development of instruments for navigation and geodesy, the study of the size and shape of the Earth.
Borda entered the French army at an early age and later transferred to the navy, where he attained the rank of capitaine de vaisseau (“post captain”), took part in several scientific voyages, and played a role in the American Revolution. Borda developed and used many instruments for measuring an arc of a meridian, or longitude line, and helped introduce the metric system into France. He applied his studies of fluid flow and fluid resistance to artillery, ships, and hydraulic pumps. He also developed a series of trigonometric tables in conjunction with his surveying techniques. In 1782, while commanding a flotilla of six ships, he was captured by the British but was immediately released on parole.
