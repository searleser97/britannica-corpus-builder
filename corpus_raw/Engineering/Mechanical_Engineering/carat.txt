Carat,   unit of weight for diamonds and certain other precious gems. Before 1913 the weight of a carat varied in different gem centres. Originally based on the weight of grains or leguminous seeds, which, of course, varied in size from place to place, the carat was equivalent to 0.2053 gram (3.168 troy grains) in London, 0.1972 g in Florence, and 0.2057 g in Amsterdam. The weight of a gemstone was calculated in terms of whole carats plus fractions (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, or 1/64) of a carat; thus, a stone might be said to weigh 3 + 1/4 + 1/16 carats. After various unsuccessful attempts to standardize the carat, the metric carat, equal to 0.200 g, and the point, equal to 0.01 carat, were adopted by the United States in 1913 and subsequently by most other countries. The weights of diamond, ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz, aquamarine, garnet, tourmaline, zircon, spinel, and sometimes opal and pearl are expressed in carats.
