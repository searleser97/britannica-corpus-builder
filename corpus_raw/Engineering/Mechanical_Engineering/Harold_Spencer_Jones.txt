Sir Harold Spencer Jones,  (born March 29, 1890, London, Eng.—died Nov. 3, 1960, London), 10th astronomer royal of England (1933–55), who organized a program that led to a more accurate determination of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun.
After studies at the University of Cambridge, Jones became chief assistant at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich in 1913. He was his majesty’s astronomer to the observatory at the Cape of Good Hope from 1923 to 1933, and in the latter year he returned to Greenwich as astronomer royal. Jones’s scientific work largely concerned determining more accurately the fundamental constants of astronomy and in particular the solar parallax—the angle subtended by the Earth’s radius as viewed from the Sun. Using information from observations of the asteroid Eros during its close approach to the Earth in 1931, he computed in 1941 the solar parallax and from that the mean distance to the Sun, approximately 149 million km (93 million miles).
When the encroachment of the smoke and lights of London spoiled observation at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, Jones took steps to have the observatory moved. After World War II a new site was procured at Herstmonceux Castle in Sussex; the new observatory was completed in 1958. In 1990 it was moved to the Institute of Astronomy of the University of Cambridge, where it remained until its closure in 1998.
In 1943 Jones was knighted and received the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of London. He was created a Knight of the British Empire in 1955. His works include Worlds Without End (1935), Life on Other Worlds (1940), and A Picture of the Universe (1947).
