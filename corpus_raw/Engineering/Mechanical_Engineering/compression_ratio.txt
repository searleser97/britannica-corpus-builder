Compression ratio,  in an internal-combustion engine, degree to which the fuel mixture is compressed before ignition. It is defined as the maximum volume of the combustion chamber (with the piston farthest out, or bottom dead centre) divided by the volume with the piston in the full-compression position (with the piston nearest the head of the cylinder, or top dead centre). A compression ratio of six means that the mixture is compressed to one-sixth its original volume by the action of the piston in the cylinder. The maximum possible ratio based on cylinder dimensions may not be achieved if the intake valve closes after the piston begins its compression stroke, as this would cause backflow of the combustible mixture from the cylinder. A high ratio promotes efficiency but may cause engine knock.
