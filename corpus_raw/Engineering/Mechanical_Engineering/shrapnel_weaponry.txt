Shrapnel,   originally a type of antipersonnel projectile named for its inventor, Henry Shrapnel (1761–1842), an English artillery officer. Shrapnel projectiles contained small shot or spherical bullets, usually of lead, along with an explosive charge to scatter the shot as well as fragments of the shell casing. A time fuze set off the explosive charge in the latter part of the shell’s flight, while it was near opposing troops. The resulting hail of high-velocity debris was often lethal; shrapnel caused the majority of artillery-inflicted wounds in World War I.
During World War II it was found that a high-explosive bursting charge fragmented the shell’s iron casing so effectively that the use of shrapnel balls was unnecessary, and it thus was discontinued. The term shrapnel continued to be used to designate the shell-casing fragments. Before explosive projectiles were used, the purposes of shrapnel were served by charging a cannon with small iron balls, called grapeshot (q.v.), or with lengths of chain.
