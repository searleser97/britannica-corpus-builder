Metrētēs,  primary liquid measure of the ancient Greeks, equivalent to 39.4 litres, or about 9 gallons. In the Greek system, of which the smallest capacity unit was the kotyle (16.5 cubic inches; 0.475 pint; 270 cubic cm), the metrētēs equaled 144 kotyle, or 12 khous, or 2 xestes. Reconstructed earthenware cylinders excavated in the Acropolis in Athens furnish the oldest known evidence of the Greek system of liquid measurement.
