Zhang, Wade-Giles chang,  an old Chinese measure of length equal to 10 chi, or 3.58 metres (11 feet 9 inches). The value was agreed upon by China in treaties (1842–44 and 1858–60) with England and France. It was thereafter used by Chinese maritime customs as the standard value for assessing all tariff duties. The length of one chi varied throughout China from 27.9 to 40 cm (11 to 15.8 inches). The so-called treaty chi was defined for customs purposes as 35.8 cm (14.1 inches).
