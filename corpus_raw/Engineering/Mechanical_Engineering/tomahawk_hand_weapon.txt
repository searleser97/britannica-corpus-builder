Tomahawk,  war hatchet of the North American Indians. “Tomahawk” was derived from the Algonquian word otomahuk (“to knock down”). Early versions were made by tying a stone head to a handle with animal sinew or by passing a double-pointed chipped stone through a hole bored in a handle. After the arrival of Europeans, tomahawk heads often were made of iron obtained in trade. Globe-headed clubs, often ornately incised and decorated with feathers, and used for ceremonies as well as war, have also been called tomahawks.
