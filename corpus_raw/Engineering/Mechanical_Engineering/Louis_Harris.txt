Louis Harris,  (born January 6, 1921, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.—died December 17, 2016, Key West, Florida), American public-opinion analyst and columnist who was the best-known pollster in the United States in the second half of the 20th century. He was among the first to offer polling and analysis services to candidates for political office and was responsible for many innovations in survey design and in sampling.
Harris, the son of a real-estate developer, studied economics at the University of North Carolina (A.B., 1942) and served in the U.S. Navy Reserve (1942–46), where he got his start in polling when he was asked to survey sailors on their views about their treatment by the navy. In 1947 he joined a polling firm headed by Elmo Roper, writing Roper’s newspaper columns and radio scripts and engaging in political research. In 1956 Harris left the firm to establish his own company, Louis Harris and Associates (now Harris Interactive, Inc.), in New York City, where he remained until his retirement in 1992. By 1962 Harris was the chief polling analyst for CBS News, though he later (1969) switched to ABC News. He was concurrently a columnist for the Washington Post and Newsweek (1963–68) and for the Chicago Tribune–New York Daily News Syndicate (1969–88). From 1969 to 1972 he was also director of the Time Magazine–Harris Poll. In 1992 he founded the polling firm LH Research.
Harris’s services were especially associated with election campaigns, initially and most notably with the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy in 1960. He later served the campaigns of hundreds of Democratic and Republican candidates for president, governor, the U.S. Congress, mayor, and other offices. Harris’s firm advised candidates on campaign strategies, helping them to determine what aspects of their personalities might be most appealing to voters. Harris also did much work in market research for commercial clients.
Among Harris’s many books are Is There a Republican Majority? (1954), Black and White (1967; with William Brink), Black-Jewish Relations in New York City: The Anguish of Change (1973), and Inside America (1987).
