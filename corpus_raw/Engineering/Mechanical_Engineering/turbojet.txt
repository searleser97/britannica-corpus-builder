Turbojet,   jet engine in which a turbine-driven compressor draws in and compresses air, forcing it into a combustion chamber into which fuel is injected. Ignition causes the gases to expand and to rush first through the turbine and then through a nozzle at the rear. Forward thrust is generated as a reaction to the rearward momentum of the exhaust gases.
The first turbojet-powered aircraft, a Heinkel He 178, was flown in Germany in 1939. A turbojet had been devised some years earlier in England by Sir Frank Whittle, but the first flight using his engine did not take place until 1941.
During the 1960s the turbofan, or fanjet, a modification of the turbojet, came into common use. Some of the incoming air is bypassed around the combustion chamber and is accelerated to the rear by a turbine-operated fan. The turbofan moves a much greater mass of air than the simple turbojet, providing advantages in power and economy. Compare ramjet.
