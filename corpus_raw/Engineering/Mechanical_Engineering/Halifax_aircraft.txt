Halifax, also called Handley Page Halifax,  British heavy bomber used during World War II. The Halifax was designed by Handley Page, Ltd., in response to a 1936 Royal Air Force (RAF) requirement for a bomber powered by two 24-cylinder Rolls-Royce Vulture engines. However, the Vulture encountered problems in development, and the bomber design was reworked in 1937 to take four Rolls-Royce Merlins. The result was a four-engined heavy bomber of mid-wing design with a twin tail that first flew in October 1939, entered production the following year, and began active service with Bomber Command in March 1941.
Powered by the 1,640-horsepower Merlins, the Halifax had a wingspan of 104 feet (31.7 metres) and was 72 feet (22 metres) long. It had a maximum speed of 280 miles (450 km) per hour and a ceiling of 24,000 feet (7,300 metres), though the latter was substantially lower when carrying a full combat load. With a bomb load of 5,800 pounds (2,600 kg), the Halifax had a range of 1,860 miles (3,000 km), and it could carry its full bomb load of 13,000 pounds (5,900 kg) to ranges of 1,000 miles (1,600 km). Shortages of Merlin engines led to the production of several hundred Halifaxes powered by more-powerful Bristol Hercules air-cooled radial engines. These entered service in early 1944 and were an improvement over Merlin-engined Halifaxes, but they were still markedly inferior to the RAF’s principal four-engined bomber, the Lancaster.
Early versions of the Halifax were armed with a power-operated tail turret mounting four 0.303-inch (7.7-mm) machine guns, powered turrets mounting two 0.303s on the upper fuselage and belly, and two 0.303s in the nose blister. Later versions removed the belly turret (mounting an H2S radar bombing system in its place), replaced the twin-gun upper turret with one mounting four 0.303s, and carried only a single machine gun on a flexible mount in the nose. In common with those of other RAF bombers, the Halifax’s 0.303-inch machine guns were badly outranged by cannon-armed German fighters—an area in which U.S. bombers were much better-served by their heavy 0.50-inch (12.7-mm) machine guns.
The Halifax was used primarily in night bombing attacks on German cities. However, it was less successful in that role than the Lancaster, and significant numbers of Halifaxes were used for maritime reconnaissance, as glider tugs, as paratroop transports (particularly in drops of arms and agents to Resistance fighters in German-occupied Europe), and as transports for personnel and high-priority cargo. More than 6,000 Halifaxes were built before production ceased in 1946.
