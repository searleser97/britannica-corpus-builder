Recoilless rifle,   any of several antitank weapons developed during World War II. They are lightweight and can be operated by one or two men. Recoil was eliminated by allowing part of the propelling blast to escape to the rear. Disadvantages are a low muzzle velocity and consequent short range. See bazooka.
