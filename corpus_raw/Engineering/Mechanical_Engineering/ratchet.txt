Ratchet,   mechanical device that transmits intermittent rotary motion or permits a shaft to rotate in one direction but not in the opposite one. In the Figure the arm A and the ratchet wheel B are both pivoted at O. The stem of the pawl P can slide in the arm and is kept in its lowest position by the spring S. If the arm oscillates through the angle α (alpha), the pawl rotates the wheel intermittently in a counterclockwise direction; if the arm rotates clockwise, the sloping side of the pawl rides over the teeth and has no turning effect on the wheel. If the pawl is rotated half a turn so that its sloping side is on the left, oscillation of the arm rotates the wheel in a clockwise direction only. Reversing ratchets of the type described are used on socket wrench handles and are convenient for tightening or loosening bolts in positions where a complete revolution of a wrench handle is impossible. They are also used to obtain an intermittent feeding motion (workpiece movement) on machine-tool worktables; the ratchet wheel is attached to the screw that moves the table, and the arm is driven by a crank, the throw of which can be varied to change α.
On mechanisms that receive their power from a wound spring, such as watches and clocks, ratchets such as that shown at C in the Figure are used. The pawl Q pivots on a fixed axis and rides over the pointed teeth when the spring is being wound but prevents rotation of the wheel in a clockwise direction.
Although ratchets with pawls and toothed wheels are the most common, other types are used. In one such type, an oscillating member works through a one-way clutch to rotate a wheel intermittently.
