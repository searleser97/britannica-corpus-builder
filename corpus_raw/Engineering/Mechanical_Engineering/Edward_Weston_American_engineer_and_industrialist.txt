Edward Weston,   (born May 9, 1850, near Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, Eng.â€”died  Aug. 20, 1936, Montclair, N.J., U.S.), British-born American electrical engineer and industrialist who founded the Weston Electrical Instrument Company.
Weston studied medicine at the insistence of his parents; but, after receiving his medical diploma in 1870, he went to New York City, where he was employed as a chemist. While working with an electroplating company, he decided that a generator would be more efficient than batteries as a source of power for electroplating. He subsequently invented and manufactured a highly successful electroplating dynamo.
Overshadowed by others in the field of lighting (arc and incandescent), Weston in 1886 turned his attention to the design and manufacture of electrical measuring instruments. In 1888 he organized the Weston Electrical Instrument Company, which became world famous for its high-quality electrical products. Weston became a U.S. citizen in 1923.
