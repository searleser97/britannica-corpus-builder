Hester Bateman, née Needham,  (born 1709, London, England—died 1794, London), silversmith noted particularly for her domestic silver of elegant simplicity.
Her husband, John Bateman, who worked in gold and silver, particularly watch chains, died in 1760. The next year she took over the family business, registering her mark at the Goldsmiths’ Hall, London. Initially she was assisted by two of her sons, John and Peter, and an apprentice. Until 1774 little Bateman work is known, largely because the shop was busy with work commissioned by other silversmiths. Thereafter, her shop became well known and successful, specializing in tableware, such as spoons, sugar bowls, salt cellars, and teapots. Energetic and shrewd in business, she also possessed exceptional skill and taste. Working with graceful, refined shapes, she characteristically used restrained decoration, most often in the form of beaded edges. In addition to domestic silver, she executed some large presentation pieces. After her retirement in 1790, the business was continued by other members of the family who, for a time, also produced outstanding silver.
