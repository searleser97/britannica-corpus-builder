Kilogram (kg),  basic unit of mass in the metric system. A kilogram is very nearly equal (it was originally intended to be exactly equal) to the mass of 1,000 cubic cm of water. The pound is defined as equal to 0.45359237 kg, exactly.
As originally defined, the kilogram was represented in the late 18th century by a solid cylinder of platinum. Measurements of the mass of a volume of water proved to be imprecise and inconvenient to make, however, and the platinum artifact itself became the standard. It was superseded in 1889 by a standard kilogram, also a solid cylinder, of height equal to its diameter, made of the same platinum-iridium alloy as the bar then in use as the standard for defining the metre. The standard kilogram was kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures laboratory at Sèvres, France. However, in 1989 it was discovered that the prototype kept at Sèvres was 50 micrograms lighter than other copies of the standard kilogram. To avoid the problem of having the kilogram defined by an object with a changing mass, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) agreed in 2011 to a proposal to begin to redefine the kilogram not by a physical artifact but by a fundamental physical constant. The constant chosen was Planck’s constant, which was to be defined as equal to 6.62607015 × 10−34 joule second. One joule is equal to one kilogram times metre squared per second squared. Since the second and the metre were already defined in terms of the frequency of a spectral line of cesium and the speed of light, respectively, the kilogram would then be determined by accurate measurements of Planck’s constant. The proposal was accepted at the 2018 CGPM and, effective from May 20, 2019, the kilogram would be defined by Planck’s constant. See also International System of Units.
