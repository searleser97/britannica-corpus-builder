Francis Hauksbee, the Elder,  Hauksbee also spelled Hawksbee,  (died c. 1713), self-educated English scientist and eclectic experimentalist whose discoveries came too early for contemporary appreciation of their significance.
Hauksbee determined with reasonable accuracy the relative weights of air and water. Investigating the forces of surface tension, he made the first accurate observations on the capillary action of tubes and glass plates. In 1706 he produced an electrostatic generator. His Physico-Mechanical Experiments on Various Subjects appeared in 1709. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1705, he contributed numerous papers to the societyâ€™s Philosophical Transactions, including an account of a two-cylinder pump that served as a pattern for vacuum pumps and remained in use with minor modifications for some 200 years.
