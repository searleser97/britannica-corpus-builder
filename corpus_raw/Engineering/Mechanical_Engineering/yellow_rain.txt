Yellow rain,  airborne substance that was alleged to have been used in biological attacks in Southeast Asia from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.
After the communist victories in Southeast Asia in 1975, the new regimes in Vietnam and Laos launched pacification campaigns against Hmong tribes in northern Laos who had assisted the former noncommunist governments and their principal ally, the United States. That summer, refugees began to report that Laotian aircraft were dropping an oily yellow liquid that made a sound like rain when it fell on roofs, roads, or leaves—what the Hmong called “yellow rain.” High-dose exposure to this substance reportedly caused symptoms such as bleeding from the nose and gums, tremors, seizures, blindness, and, in some cases, death. Further reports surfaced of similar experiences by Khmer tribes in Cambodia in 1978 and by anti-Soviet resistance fighters in Afghanistan in 1979.
In 1981 the United States accused the Soviet Union of supplying their allies in Laos and Vietnam with trichothecene mycotoxins, a poison produced by fungi that was known to have potential as a biological weapon. Soviet officials denied the charge, and some leading U.S. scientists also questioned the evidence, saying that there were plausible natural causes for the events and symptoms, such as the airborne release of feces by swarms of giant Asian honeybees. Critics also questioned the reliability of the refugees’ testimony and the integrity of laboratory analyses conducted on samples of the substance. To this day, the source of the yellow rain is not definitively settled.
