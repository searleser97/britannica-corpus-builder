James Hargreaves, Hargreaves also spelled Hargraves,  (baptized January 8, 1721, Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, Englandâ€”died April 22, 1778, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire), English inventor of the spinning jenny, the first practical application of multiple spinning by a machine. At the time he devised the machine, he was a poor, uneducated spinner and weaver living at Stanhill, near Blackburn, Lancashire.
About 1764 Hargreaves is said to have conceived the idea for his hand-powered multiple spinning machine when he observed a spinning wheel that had been accidentally overturned by his young daughter Jenny. As the spindle continued to revolve in an upright rather than a horizontal position, Hargreaves reasoned that many spindles could be so turned. He constructed a machine with which one individual could spin several threads at one time. After he began to sell the machines to help support his large family, hand spinners, fearing unemployment, broke into his house and destroyed a number of jennies, causing Hargreaves to move to Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England, in 1768. With a partner, Thomas James, he built a small mill in which they used jennies to spin yarn for hosiers. He received a patent for the jenny on July 12, 1770. Until his death, he worked at the mill, which proved moderately successful.
