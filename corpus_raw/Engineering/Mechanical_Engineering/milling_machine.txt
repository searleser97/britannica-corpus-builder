Milling machine,   device that rotates a circular tool that has a number of cutting edges symmetrically arranged about its axis; the workpiece is commonly held in a vise or similar device clamped to a table that can move in three perpendicular directions. Disk- or barrel-shaped cutters are clamped through holes in their centres to arbors (shafts) attached to the machine spindle; they have teeth on their peripheries only or on both peripheries and faces. An end mill is a cutter shaped like a pencil with a tapered shank that fits into the machine spindle; it has cutting teeth on its face and spiral blades on the lateral surface.
In the milling operation the workpiece is carried on a table that is driven either manually or by power against the rotating cutter. Milling machines usually produce flat surfaces, but any shape that can be ground on the cutter will be reproduced on the work. To mill the teeth of a spur gear, a disk-type cutter with its cutting edges in the shape of the space (groove) between the teeth of the gear is used, milling the gear blank one space at a time.
