Matchlock,   in firearms, a device for igniting gunpowder developed in the 15th century, a major advance in the manufacture of small arms. The matchlock was the first mechanical firing device. It consisted of an S-shaped arm, called a serpentine, that held a match, and a trigger device that lowered the serpentine so that the lighted match would fire the priming powder in the pan attached to the side of the barrel. The flash in the pan penetrated a small port in the breech of the gun and ignited the main charge.
In the matchlock all the working elements were protected inside the lock. The device also freed the hand of the user or his aide. Early matchlock guns had a number of names including harquebus, hacquebut, hagbutt, hachbuss, caliver, and musket. Slow and somewhat clumsy, the matchlock was difficult to use in wind or rain, and its glow presented a hazard at night or in ambush. Matchlock guns, however, remained primary military firearms in Europe even after other ignition systems were invented.
