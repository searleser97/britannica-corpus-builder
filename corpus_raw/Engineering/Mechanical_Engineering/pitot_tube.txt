Pitot tube,  instrument for measuring the velocity (speed) of a flowing fluid. Invented by Henri Pitot (1695â€“1771), it consists of a tube with a short right-angled bend, which is placed vertically in a moving fluid with the mouth of the bent part directed upstream; the pressure, measured with an attached device, depends on the fluid flow and can be used to calculate the velocity. Pitot tubes are used in anemometers to measure airspeed in wind tunnels and aboard aircraft in flight; they are also used to measure the flow of liquids (see flow meter).
