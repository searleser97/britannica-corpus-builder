M16 rifle, also called AR-15,  assault rifle developed as the AR-15 by American engineer Eugene Stoner of ArmaLite Inc. in the late 1950s. The rifle received high marks for its light weight, its accuracy, and the volume of fire that it could provide.
The AR-15 was developed as a more portable alternative to the 7.62-mm (.308-calibre) battlefield rifles of the day, but ArmaLite had limited success in marketing it to the U.S. military. The AR-15 design was licensed to Colt’s Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company (later Colt’s Manufacturing LLC) in 1959, and upon its adoption by the U.S. Air Force in 1962, the AR-15 was designated the M16 by the Department of Defense. Modified versions of the AR-15 (designated the XM16E1) were used by American combat troops in the Vietnam War in the mid-1960s. Despite its advantages, it was prone to jamming because of a convergence of factors. Improved training, wider distribution of cleaning kits, and a change in the composition of the powder used in the rifle’s ammunition dramatically reduced the rate of malfunction. With some minor adjustments based on recommendations from the field, the rifle, now designated the M16A1, was adopted as the standard infantry weapon for the U.S. military in 1967, superseding the M14 rifle. Colt subsequently marketed a semiautomatic version of the rifle to civilians and law-enforcement personnel as the AR-15, and upon the expiration of various patents in the 1970s, other companies followed suit. That resulted in the application of the term AR-15 both to a specific type of semiautomatic rifle and to the broader family of selective-fire rifles based on the original ArmaLite platform.
The M16 is gas-operated and, in its original configuration, had both semiautomatic (i.e., autoloading) and fully automatic fire-control options. The M16A2, adopted by the U.S. military in the early 1980s, replaced fully automatic fire with a three-round-burst capability that was intended to increase accuracy and reduce ammunition consumption. The use of aluminum and composite materials rather than wood made the various iterations of the M16 significantly lighter than the M14 or the AK-47. The M16A4—the standard infantry weapon of the U.S. Marine Corps since 2003—weighs less than 3.3 kg (just over 7 pounds) unloaded. It measures 100 cm (39 inches) long, has a 20-round or 30-round magazine, and fires 5.56-mm (.223-calibre) ammunition at a rate of 700–950 rounds per minute. Optional enhancements to the M16 family include the M203 grenade launcher, a bayonet, and an assortment of rail-mounted flashlights, scopes, and laser-targeting systems. Although the M16 remained the weapon of choice for military forces around the world into the 21st century, by 2010 the U.S. Army had largely transitioned to the M4, a carbine based on the AR-15 platform, as its primary infantry weapon.
