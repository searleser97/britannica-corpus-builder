Ultramicroscope,   microscope arrangement used to study colloidal-size particles that are too small to be visible in an ordinary light microscope. The particles, usually suspended in a liquid, are illuminated with a strong light beam perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope. These particles scatter light, and their movements are seen only as flashes against a dark background; their structure is not resolved.
