Celt,   characteristic New Stone Age tool, a polished stone ax or adz head designed for attachment to a wooden shaft and probably mainly used for felling trees or shaping wood. Great numbers of celts have been discovered in sites in the British Isles and Denmark; they were obviously traded widely. Bronze Age tools of similar general design are also called celts.
