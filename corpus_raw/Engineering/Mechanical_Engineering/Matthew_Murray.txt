Matthew Murray,  (born 1765, near Newcastle upon Tyne, Eng.â€”died Feb. 20, 1826, Holbeck, Leeds), English engineer.
With little formal education, Murray went to work for a flax spinner in Leeds, where he introduced innovations in flax-spinning machinery. He established his own factory and was soon patenting various improvements to the steam engine. The locomotives he built for local collieries in 1812 were the first regularly employed for commercial purposes. In 1813 he built an early commercial steamboat, and he claimed the planing machine as his invention.
