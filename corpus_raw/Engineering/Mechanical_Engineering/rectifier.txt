Rectifier,  device that converts alternating electric current into direct current. It may be an electron tube (either a vacuum or a gaseous type), vibrator, solid-state device, or mechanical device. Direct current is necessary for the operation of many devices such as laptop computers, televisions, and certain power tools.
If only one polarity of an alternating current is used to produce a pulsating direct current, the process is called half-wave rectification. When both polarities are used, producing a continuous train of pulses, the process is called full-wave rectification.
Diodes are used in half- and full-wave circuits. In a full-wave circuit, two diodes are used, one for each for half of the cycle. A half-wave circuit uses only one diode.
