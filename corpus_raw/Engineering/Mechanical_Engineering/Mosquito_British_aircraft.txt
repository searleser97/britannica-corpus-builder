Mosquito, in full De Havilland DH-98 Mosquito,  British twin-engine, two-seat, mid-wing bomber aircraft that was adapted to become the prime night fighter of the Allies during World War II. The Mosquito had a frame of wood and a skin of plywood, and it was glued and screwed together in England, Canada, and Australia. The plane was designed in 1938 and entered service in 1941.
As a night fighter, the Mosquito downed more than 600 Luftwaffe planes over Germany and as many V-1 missiles (buzz bombs) over England and the English Channel. As a bomber, it proved able to carry twice the bomb load for which it was designed. The Mosquito had a maximum speed in excess of 400 miles per hour (640 km/h) and a range of more than 1,500 miles (2,415 km) with a 4,000-pound (1,816-kilogram) bomb load. Its original armament included four .303-calibre machine guns and four 20-millimetre cannons, all firing through the nose. The airplane was produced in so many modifications for so many missions, however, that armament varied widely through the war and later, when it was used in the air forces of countries around the world. Including production in the three continents where it was made, there were 42 “marks,” or versions, of the 7,780 Mosquitos that were built. It served as a bomber, fighter, night fighter, high-altitude fighter, and photo-reconnaissance plane, and it was even used to fly a wartime airline connection over enemy territory between Britain and Sweden.
