Hectare,  unit of area in the metric system equal to 100 ares, or 10,000 square metres, and the equivalent of 2.471 acres in the British Imperial System and the United States Customary measure. The term is derived from the Latin area and from hect, an irregular contraction of the Greek word for hundred. Although the are is the primary metric unit of land measurement, in practice the hectare is more commonly used. The hectare is, by subsequent definition, equal to a djerib in Turkey, a jerib in Iran, a gong qing in mainland China, a manzana in Argentina, and a bunder in the Netherlands.
