Joseph Rogers Brown,  (born Jan. 26, 1810, Warren, R.I., U.S.—died  July 23, 1876, Isles of Shoals, N.H.), American inventor and manufacturer who made numerous advances in the field of fine measurement and machine-tool production.
After training as a machinist, Brown joined his father in a successful clock-making business, which he operated himself from 1841 to 1853. He perfected and produced a highly accurate linear dividing engine in 1850, and in the succeeding two years he developed a vernier caliper reading to thousandths of an inch and also applied vernier methods to the protractor. In 1853 Brown took Lucian Sharpe into partnership; the firm later became the Brown and Sharpe Manufacturing Company. Brown’s micrometer caliper, widely used in industry, appeared in 1867. He also invented a precision gear cutter in 1855 to produce clock gears, a universal milling machine in 1862, and, perhaps his finest innovation, a universal grinding machine (patented in 1877), in which articles were hardened first and then ground, thereby increasing accuracy and eliminating waste.
