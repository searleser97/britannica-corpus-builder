MAG machine gun, also called Fn Mag,  general-purpose machine gun used primarily as a tank- or vehicle-mounted weapon, although it is also made with a butt and bipod for infantry use. Manufactured by Belgium’s Fabrique Nationale d’Armes de Guerre (FN), the MAG was adopted for use by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). It is air-cooled and gas-operated; its name is an acronym from the French phrase mitrailleuse à gaz (“gas-operated machine gun”). It fires a 7.62-millimetre (.31-inch) round and is fed from a metal link belt of 50 rounds. It fires automatically at a cyclic rate of 600–1,000 rounds per minute.
The MAG can be used as a medium machine gun by adding a 23-pound (10.5-kilogram) tripod. With butt and bipod, it weighs 23.9 pounds (10.8 kg). Its 21-inch (54-centimetre) barrel can be changed quickly, permitting sustained fire at a maximum effective range of 3,900 feet (1,200 m). The MAG is used by many armies around the world.
