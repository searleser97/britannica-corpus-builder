Peacekeeper missile, also called MX,  intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that was part of the United States’ strategic nuclear arsenal from 1986 to 2005.
The MX (for “missile experimental”) was the most-sophisticated ICBM fielded by the United States during the Cold War against the Soviet Union. Under development from 1971, it evolved into a 22-metre (71-foot) missile with a “bus,” or fourth stage, located in its front end that carried 10 or 12 independently targeted warheads (or MIRVs). This endowed each missile with several times the firepower of the two- or three-warhead Minuteman III, which it was designed to replace. In addition, the missile’s extreme accuracy—made possible by an inertial guidance system updated in flight by signals from navigation satellites—gave its 300-kiloton thermonuclear warheads greater potential to destroy reinforced missile silos and command bunkers in the Soviet Union. The MX had a range of approximately 11,000 km (7,000 miles).
In order to be able to evade attack by Soviet ICBMs, which lagged behind U.S. ICBMs in accuracy but were far more powerful, several types of basing modes were proposed for the MX. These included launching by air from huge transport jets, “deep basing” in silos located more than 300 metres (1,000 feet) underground, shuttling the missiles continuously on trucks or railcars among “multiple protective shelters,” and grouping silos close together in a “dense pack,” so that incoming nuclear warheads would destroy or deflect one another. All these modes proved to be prohibitively expensive, and none was politically popular. In 1983 it was decided to place the missiles in Minuteman III silos.
Although plans called for 100 Peacekeepers, only 50 were deployed from 1986 to 1988 at Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming. Between 2002 and 2005 the missiles were deactivated under the terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks between the United States and Russia, and their modern warheads were fitted onto Minuteman IIIs.
