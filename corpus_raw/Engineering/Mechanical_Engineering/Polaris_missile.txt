Polaris missile,  first U.S. submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) and the mainstay of the British nuclear deterrent force during the 1970s and â€™80s.
After four years of research and development, the U.S. Navy in 1960 began to deploy nuclear-powered submarines armed with 16 Polaris missiles each. Each missile was 31 feet (9.4 m) long and 4.5 feet (1.4 m) in diameter and was powered by two solid-fueled stages. Three models were developed: the A-1, with a range of 1,400 miles (2,200 km) and a one-megaton nuclear warhead; the A-2, with a 1,700-mile (2,700-kilometre) range and a one-megaton warhead; and the A-3, capable of delivering three 200-kiloton warheads a distance of 2,800 miles (4,500 km).
Between 1971 and 1978 the Polaris was replaced by the Poseidon missile in the U.S. SLBM force. The United Kingdom, after adopting the A-3 in 1969, refined it into the A-3TK, or Chevaline, system, which was fitted with such devices as decoy warheads and electronic jammers for penetrating Soviet ballistic-missile defenses around Moscow. In 1980 the United Kingdom announced plans to replace its Polaris force with the Trident SLBM in the 1990s.
