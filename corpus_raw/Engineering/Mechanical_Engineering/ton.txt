Ton,  unit of weight in the avoirdupois system equal to 2,000 pounds (907.18 kg) in the United States (the short ton) and 2,240 pounds (1,016.05 kg) in Britain (the long ton). The metric ton used in most other countries is 1,000 kg, equivalent to 2,204.6 pounds avoirdupois. The term derives from tun, denoting a large barrel used in the wine trade and named from the French tonnerre, or “thunder,” in turn named for the rumbling it produced when rolled. Ton came to mean any large weight, until it was standardized at 20 hundredweight although the total weight could be 2,000, 2,160, 2,240, or 2,400 pounds (from 907.18 to 1088.62 kg) depending on whether the corresponding hundredweight contained 100, 108, 112, or 120 pounds.
Ton, as a unit of volume, may also refer to the cargo capacity of ships or to the freight itself. The register ton is defined as 100 cubic feet, the freight or measurement ton as 40 cubic feet; an older measure of a ship’s displacement was based on the volume of a long ton of seawater, or 35 cubic feet. Variant tons of capacity have existed for specific commodities, such as the English water ton, used to measure petroleum products and equal to 224 British Imperial System gallons; the timber ton of 40 cubic feet; and the wheat ton of 20 U.S. bushels.
