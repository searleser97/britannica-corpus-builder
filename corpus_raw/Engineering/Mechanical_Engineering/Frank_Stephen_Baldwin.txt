Frank Stephen Baldwin,  (born April 10, 1838, New Hartford, Connecticut, U.S.â€”died April 8, 1925, Denville, New Jersey), inventor best-known for his development of the Monroe calculator.
His first calculator, the arithmometer (patented 1874), could add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Economic conditions, however, prevented its immediate manufacture. The Baldwin computing engine (1900) was followed by the Baldwin calculator (1902), but not until 1911 (patent date 1913), in association with Jay Monroe, did he perfect the Monroe calculator. He remained research director of the Monroe Calculating Machine Company until his death.
