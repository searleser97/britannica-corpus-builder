Sir Frederic Williams,  (born June 26, 1911, Stockport, Cheshire, Eng.â€”died  Aug. 11, 1977, Manchester), British electrical engineer who invented the Williams tube store, a cathode-ray-tube memory system that heralded the beginning of the computer age.
Educated at the University of Manchester and at Magdalen College, Oxford, Williams in 1939 joined the staff of the Bawdsey Research Station, University of Manchester, where he developed the first practical system of radar identification of friendly aircraft. His system was the forerunner of modern systems using intricate codes and varying radar frequencies. In the early 1940s he perfected the first fully automatic radar for use in fighter aircraft. In 1946, the year in which he became professor of electrotechnics at Manchester, he invented the Williams tube. Although superseded by the magnetic-core memory, the Williams tube was used in first-generation digital computers throughout the world. Shortly thereafter he became professor of electrical engineering at the University of Manchester, where he developed his memory system further and applied it to early computers. He was knighted in 1976.
