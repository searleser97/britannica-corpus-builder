Curie,  in physics, unit of activity of a quantity of a radioactive substance, named in honour of the French physicist Pierre Curie. (Even though the committee that named the unit in 1910 said it honoured Pierre Curie, some committee members later said the unit was in honour of both Pierre and Marie Curie [who also sat on the committee] or Marie Curie herself.) One curie (1 Ci) is equal to 3.7 × 1010 radioactive decays per second, which is roughly the amount of decays that occur in 1 gram of radium per second and is 3.7 × 1010 becquerels (Bq). In 1975 the becquerel replaced the curie as the official radiation unit in the International System of Units (SI).
