George Gallup, in full George Horace Gallup,  (born November 18, 1901, Jefferson, Iowa, U.S.—died July 26, 1984, Tschingel, Switzerland), American public-opinion statistician whose Gallup Poll became almost synonymous with public-opinion surveys. Gallup helped to advance the public’s trust in survey research in 1936 when he, Elmo Roper, and Archibald Crossley, acting independently but using similar sampling methods, accurately forecast the victory of Franklin D. Roosevelt over Alfred M. Landon in the U.S. presidential election. His work with public-opinion surveys altered both political campaigns and corporate marketing.
Gallup taught journalism at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, until 1932, when he was hired by an advertising firm in New York City to conduct public-opinion surveys on behalf of its clients. In addition to serving as a professor at Columbia University’s Pulitzer School of Journalism (1935–37), he founded the American Institute of Public Opinion (1935), the British Institute of Public Opinion (1936), and the Audience Research Institute, Inc. (1939). Along with other pollsters, Gallup incorrectly predicted the defeat of Pres. Harry S. Truman in the U.S. presidential election of 1948, in large part because he chose—despite the presence of a large percentage of undecided voters—to discontinue polling two weeks before the election, since his early polls indicated a large lead for Truman’s challenger, Thomas Dewey. Afterward, Gallup concluded that undecided voters tend disproportionately to favour incumbents.
Gallup wrote several books, including The Pulse of Democracy (1940) and The Sophisticated Poll Watcher’s Guide (1972). He also founded Quill and Scroll, an international honour society for high-school journalists.
