Fog dispersal,  artificial dissipation of fogs, usually by seeding or heating. It is done primarily at airports to improve visibility. Many attempts have been made to clear fogs at temperatures above freezing (0 °C [32 °F]) by seeding them with salt particles, by downwash mixing (that is, using whirling helicopter rotors to pump dry air downward into the fog layer), and by heating the air near landing strips with burners; however, these techniques have been shown to provide only short-term relief under limited conditions. Fog dispersal at temperatures below freezing, however, is regularly performed at many airports by seeding them with solid and liquid carbon dioxide or with propane gas sprayed from the ground.
