Torpedo plane, also called torpedo bomber,  aircraft designed to launch torpedoes. In about 1910 the navies of several countries began to experiment with torpedo launching from low-flying aircraft, usually seaplanes. The first effective use of this technique occurred on Aug. 12, 1915, when a British Short Type 184 seaplane sank a Turkish vessel in the Dardanelles. Other naviesâ€™ torpedo planes also had some success during World War I.
Between the world wars most navies decided to operate torpedo bombers from aircraft carriers. In World War II the torpedo plane scored spectacular successes, among them the British night raid on the Italian fleet anchored at Taranto in November 1940, the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor, and the U.S. victory at Midway in 1942. Land-based torpedo planes also saw extensive use in World War II: by  Italy and Britain in the Mediterranean, by Germany intercepting British convoys in the North Sea, and by the Japanese in the Pacific. Perhaps the most dramatic success of land-based torpedo planes was when Japanese twin-engined torpedo bombers sank the British battleships Repulse and Prince of Wales in December 1941. Like dive bombers, torpedo planes proved vulnerable to fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft fire and often suffered heavy losses. With the postwar development of air-launched missiles, aerial torpedoes were largely relegated to antisubmarine use and were carried by long-range patrol aircraft generally larger than the earlier specialized torpedo bombers.
