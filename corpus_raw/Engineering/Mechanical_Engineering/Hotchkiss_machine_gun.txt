Hotchkiss machine gun,  originally a big-bore, hand-cranked, rapid-fire weapon developed in 1878 by Benjamin B. Hotchkiss (1826–85), a U.S. ordnance engineer with a factory in Paris. It was first used by the French army in 1896.
Another gun from the Hotchkiss factory, the Hotchkiss Model 1914, was one of the first gas-operated, air-cooled machine guns. Developed in 1914, it was widely used by the French during World War I. It had a heavy barrel with external fins to dissipate heat, and weighed 88 pounds (40 kilograms). It could fire at the rate of 450–500 rounds per minute and had a muzzle velocity of 2,325 feet per second. It was fed by strips of belts, each holding 24–30 rounds. A 250-round belt was also made.
A later Hotchkiss gun, the 13.2-millimetre M1932, developed in 1932, fired at the rate of 450 rounds per minute. It was 95 inches (241 centimetres) long, with a 65-in. barrel.
