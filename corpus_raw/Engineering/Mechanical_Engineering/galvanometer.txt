Galvanometer,   instrument for measuring a small electrical current or a function of the current by deflection of a moving coil. The deflection is a mechanical rotation derived from forces resulting from the current.
The most common type is the Dâ€™Arsonval galvanometer, in which the indicating system consists of a light coil of wire suspended from a metallic ribbon between the poles of a permanent magnet. The magnetic field produced by a current passing through the coil reacts with the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, producing a torque, or twisting force. The coil, to which an indicating needle or mirror is attached, rotates under the action of the torque; the angle through which it rotates to balance the torsion of the suspension provides a measure of the current flowing in the coil. The angle is measured by the movement of the needle or by the deflection of a beam of light reflected from the mirror.
The ballistic galvanometer is designed to deflect its indicating needle (or mirror) in a way that is proportional to the total charge passing through its moving coil or to a voltage pulse of short duration. Any conventional galvanometer may also be employed as a ballistic type, but the latter has smaller torque and higher inertia in the coil.
