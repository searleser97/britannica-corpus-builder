Reversing thermometer,  oceanographic device for measuring underwater temperature and pressure. It consists of two mercury thermometers—one protected from the water pressure and the other exposed—mounted so that they can slide up and down a cable lowered from a ship. When the reversing thermometers have been lowered to the depth to be measured, a device called a messenger is dropped down the cable, causing the thermometers to be inverted, breaking their mercury columns, and preserving their temperature readings as the device is hauled back on board ship. The exposed and protected thermometers will show different temperatures; the variation is systematically related to water pressure. From the exposed thermometer, the underwater temperature is obtained, while from the difference in the two readings, the water pressure is calculated or read from tables.
