Calorimeter,  device for measuring the heat developed during a mechanical, electrical, or chemical reaction, and for calculating the heat capacity of materials.
Calorimeters have been designed in great variety. One type in widespread use, called a bomb calorimeter, basically consists of an enclosure in which the reaction takes place, surrounded by a liquid, such as water, that absorbs the heat of the reaction and thus increases in temperature. Measurement of this temperature rise and a knowledge of the weight and heat characteristics of the container and liquid permits the total amount of heat generated to be calculated.
The design of a typical bomb calorimeter is shown in the Figure. The material to be analyzed is deposited inside a steel reaction vessel called a bomb. The steel bomb is placed inside a bucket filled with water, which is kept at a constant temperature relative to the entire calorimeter by use of a heater and a stirrer. The temperature of the water is monitored with a thermometer fitted with a magnifying eyepiece, which allows accurate readings to be taken. Heat losses are minimized by inserting an air space between the bucket and an exterior insulating jacket. Slots at the top of the steel bomb allow ignition wires and an oxygen supply to enter the vessel, both of which are critical in starting the chemical reaction. When an electric current passes through the ignition coil, a combustion reaction occurs. The heat released from the sample is largely absorbed by the water, which results in an increase in temperature. Bomb calorimeters have been developed to the point that heats of combustion of organic materials can be measured with results reproducible within 0.01 percent.
