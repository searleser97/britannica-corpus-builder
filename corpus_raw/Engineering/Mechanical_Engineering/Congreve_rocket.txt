Congreve rocket,  artillery rocket developed by Sir William Congreve (q.v.) and first used in 1806. It was an improvement over the rockets used by Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, against the British in Indian in the 1790s. Used by both the British and Americans during the War of 1812, Congreve rockets bursting during the Battle of Ft. McHenry created “the rockets’ red glare” that inspired Francis Scott Key to compose “The Star Spangled Banner,” later adopted as the national anthem of the United States. Congreve rockets varied in weight from 25 to 60 pounds (11.4 to 27.2 kilograms) and could carry either an incendiary or an antipersonnel warhead. The Congreve was a stick-guided rocket, with a range of 0.5 to 2 miles (0.8 to 3.2 kilometres), depending upon its size.
