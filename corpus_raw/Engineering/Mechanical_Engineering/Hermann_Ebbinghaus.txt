Hermann Ebbinghaus,  (born January 24, 1850, Barmen, Rhenish Prussia [Germany]—died February 26, 1909, Halle, Germany), German psychologist who pioneered in the development of experimental methods for the measurement of rote learning and memory.
Ebbinghaus received a Ph.D. degree from the University of Bonn in 1873. Shortly thereafter he became assistant professor at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University, Berlin, a post he held until 1894, when he was appointed professor at the University of Breslau.
Using himself as a subject for observation, Ebbinghaus devised 2,300 three-letter nonsense syllables for measuring the formation of mental associations. This learning invention, together with the stringent control factors that he developed and his meticulous treatment of data, brought him to the conclusion that memory is orderly. His findings, which included the well-known “forgetting curve” that relates forgetting to the passage of time, were reported in Über das Gedächtnis (1885; Memory).
After completing his work on memory, Ebbinghaus turned to research on colour vision and in 1890, with the physicist Arthur König, founded the periodical Zeitschrift für Psychologie und Physiologie der Sinnesorgane (“Journal of the Psychology and Physiology of the Sense Organs”). In conjunction with a study of the mental capacities of Breslau schoolchildren (1897), he created a word-completion test. That same year the first part of another work on which his reputation rests, Grundzüge der Psychologie (1902; “Principles of Psychology”), was published. In 1905 he left Breslau for the University of Halle, where he wrote a still more popular work, Abriss der Psychologie (1908; “Summary of Psychology”). Ebbinghaus’ research showed that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, scientific methods could be applied to the study of the higher thought processes.
