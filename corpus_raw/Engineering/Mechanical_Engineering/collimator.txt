Collimator,  device for changing the diverging light or other radiation from a point source into a parallel beam. This collimation of the light is required to make specialized measurements in spectroscopy and in geometric and physical optics.
An optical collimator consists of a tube containing a convex lens at one end and an adjustable aperture at the other, the aperture being in the focal plane of the lens. Radiation entering the aperture leaves the collimator as a parallel beam, so that the image can be viewed without parallax.
The collimator may be a telescope with an aperture at the principal focal length of the lens. Light from the luminous source is focused on this slit by another lens of similar focal length, and the slit then serves as the luminous object of the optical system.
In radiology, a collimator is an arrangement of absorbers for limiting a beam of X-rays, gamma rays, or nuclear particles to the dimensions and angular spread required for the specific application.
