Cromwell tank, also called Cromwell VI or Cruiser Mark VIII,  British medium tank that was used in the later stages of World War II. The Cromwell was designed to replace the Crusader tank (a lightweight cruiser, or cavalry, tank that had seen extensive use in North Africa) and was driven by a 600-horsepower Rolls-Royce Meteor engine. The initial models, however, were powered by other engines and were designated Cavaliers and Centaurs when they entered service in mid-1942. The first genuine Cromwells with Meteor engines entered service in early 1943.
The Cromwell tank weighed about 27 tons and had a top speed of 61 km (38 miles) per hour and a range of between about 130 and 275 km (80 and 170 miles), depending on the terrain. It was initially armed with a 75-mm gun and two 7.92-mm machine guns. The Cromwell’s main assets were speed, maneuverability, and ease of repair. The tank first entered battle in large numbers in mid-1944, during the Normandy Invasion and the ensuing campaign across northern France. From Normandy on, Cromwells and American Sherman tanks formed the backbone of British armoured divisions. The early Cromwells were outgunned by German panzers (tanks), such as the Panther (Pz. V) and Tiger (Pz. VI), so later models were outfitted with a 95-mm howitzer (artillery piece) that could better penetrate enemy tanks’ armour. Cromwell tanks served in British armies until the war ended in Europe in mid-1945.
