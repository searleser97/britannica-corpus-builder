Minority carrier injection,  in electronics, a process taking place at the boundary between p-type and n-type semiconductor materials, used in some types of transistors. Each semiconductor material contains two types of freely moving charges: electrons (negative charges) and holes (positive charges). Electrons are the more abundant, or majority, carrier in n-type materials, holes being the less abundant, or minority, carrier. In p-type materials, however, holes are the majority carrier, and electrons the minority carrier. If a battery is properly connected to the semiconductor material, the p-type material may acquire additional electrons (minority carriers), injected into the p-type material from the n-type material by the flow of electrons from the battery. This is minority carrier injection. It is important in bipolar junction transistors, which are made of two p-n junctions.
