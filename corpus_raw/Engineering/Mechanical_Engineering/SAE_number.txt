SAE number,  code for specifying the viscosity of lubricating oil, established by the U.S. Society of Automotive Engineers. The numbers for crankcase lubricants range from 5 to 50, for transmission and axle lubricants they range from 75 to 250; the lower the number, the more readily the oil flows. The suffix W indicates that the oil is suitable for winter use. W oils are rated according to their flow rates at 0° F (-17.8° C); other types are tested at 210° F (99° C). Multirated oils, such as 10W–30, contain additives that oppose the tendency to thicken at low temperature, making the same oil satisfy both summer and winter requirements.
