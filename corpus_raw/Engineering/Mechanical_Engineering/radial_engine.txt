Radial engine,  Type of internal-combustion engine used mainly in small airplanes, in which the cylinders (ranging from five to as many as 28, depending on engine size) are mounted in a circle around the crankshaft, sometimes in banks of two or more. Once the dominant piston-engine type, radials are now in only limited production; most new requirements are met by remanufacturing existing stock.
