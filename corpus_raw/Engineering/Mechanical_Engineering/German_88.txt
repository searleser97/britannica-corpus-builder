German 88,   versatile 88-millimetre (3.46-inch) multirole artillery piece, developed from 1917 by Germany. It was tested in the Spanish Civil War and was used extensively by the Germans in World War II as a field-artillery piece and as an antiaircraft and antitank gun. It was in fact the most effective antitank gun used by any side in that conflict. Many versions of the German 88 were developed. In the late 1970s there were reports that some were still in service in Czechoslovakia, Finland, Spain, and Yugoslavia.
