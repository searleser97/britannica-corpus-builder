Longbow,   bow commonly 6 feet (1.8 metres) tall and the predominant missile weapon of the English in the Hundred Years’ War and on into the 16th century. It was probably of Welsh origin. The best longbows were made of yew, might have required a force of as much as 150 to 180 pounds (70 to 80 kg) to draw, and shot arrows a cloth yard (about 37 inches, or 94 cm) long, with an effective range of some 450 to 1,000 feet (140 to 300 metres)  depending on the weight of the arrow. The longbow played an important role in the battles of Crécy, Poitiers, and Agincourt.
