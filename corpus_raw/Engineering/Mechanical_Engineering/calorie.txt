Calorie,  a unit of energy or heat variously defined. The calorie was originally defined as the amount of heat required at a pressure of 1 standard atmosphere to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1° Celsius. Since 1925 this calorie has been defined in terms of the joule, the definition since 1948 being that one calorie is equal to approximately 4.2 joules. Because the quantity of heat represented by the calorie is known to differ at different temperatures (by as much as 1 percent), it has consequently been necessary to define the temperature at which the specific heat of water is to be taken as 1 calorie. Thus the “15° calorie” (also called the gram-calorie, or small calorie) was defined as the amount of heat that will raise the temperature of 1 gram of water from 14.5° to 15.5° C—equal to 4.1855 joules. Other less common definitions in this series are the 20° calorie (4.18190 joules) from 19.5° to 20.5° C; and the mean calorie (4.19002 joules) defined as 1/100 of the heat necessary to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water from 0° to 100° C.
Another calorie, a unit of heat energy, is the International Table calorie (IT calorie), originally defined as 1/860 international watt-hour. It is equal to 4.1868 joules and is used in engineering steam tables.
A unit of heat energy used in thermochemistry is the thermochemical calorie, equal to 4.184 joules. It is commonly used as the unit for heat capacities, latent heats, and heats of reaction.
In a popular use of the term calorie, dietitians loosely use it to mean the kilocalorie, sometimes called the kilogram calorie, or large Calorie (equal to 1,000 calories), in measuring the calorific, heating, or metabolizing value of foods. Thus, the “calories” counted for dietary reasons are in fact kilocalories, with the “kilo-” prefix omitted; in scientific notations a capitalized Calorie is used. In other words, if a peach is listed as having 40 Calories, this indicates that that peach has actually 40,000 calories.
In nutrition it has been proposed that the kilojoule replace the kilocalorie as the unit of choice for discussing the energy value of foods. Such a change would bring the nomenclature of food scientists into closer agreement with that of other scientists. The conversion factor for expressing kilocalories as kilojoules, as recommended by the Committee on Nomenclature of the International Union of Nutritional Sciences, is 1 kilocalorie equals 4.184 kilojoules, based on the kilocalorie determined at 14.5° to 15.5° C. Although government publications now often provide energy counts in kilojoules and kilocalories, Calorie is still the most commonly used food energy unit around the world.
