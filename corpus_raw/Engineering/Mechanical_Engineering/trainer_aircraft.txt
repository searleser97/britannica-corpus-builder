Trainer,   in military aviation, an airplane that is designed and used to train pilots to operate advanced aircraft effectively. The complicated modern military airplane requires a high degree of skill on the part of pilots. Military training programs commonly make use of a single-engine aircraft for primary training phases, with twin-jet trainers for transition stages.
Primary training airplanes are generally of simplified construction, with a minimum of complicated equipment. The transition trainers are considerably more complicated. They are fast and highly maneuverable and can be fitted with a variety of complicated equipment found also in combat types.
Training in navigation is generally given on a class basis, in which groups of students are taken aloft in a “flying classroom,” usually a twin-engined transport airplane containing a number of navigator’s stations at which each student can make his own observations and computations while in the air.
Because the use of high-speed, high-performance military airplanes for training purposes is expensive, difficult, and dangerous, a great deal of pilot and crew training is done in flight simulators (q.v.).
