Babylonian calendar,  chronological system used in ancient Mesopotamia, based on a year of 12 synodic monthsâ€”i.e., 12 complete cycles of phases of the Moon. This lunar year of about 354 days was more or less reconciled with the solar year, or year of the seasons, by the occasional intercalation of an extra month. From about 380 bce the beginning of the first month of the year, Nisanu, was maintained near the onset of spring by the use of a regular cycle (similar to the Greek Metonic cycle) of intercalations, in which 7 out of 19 years had an extra month added.
