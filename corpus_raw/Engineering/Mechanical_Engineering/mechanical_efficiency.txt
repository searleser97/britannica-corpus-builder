Mechanical efficiency,   measure of the effectiveness with which a mechanical system performs. It is usually the ratio of the power delivered by a mechanical system to the power supplied to it, and, because of friction, this efficiency is always less than one. For simple machines, such as the lever and the jackscrew, the efficiency is the actual load lifted divided by the theoretical force delivered.
