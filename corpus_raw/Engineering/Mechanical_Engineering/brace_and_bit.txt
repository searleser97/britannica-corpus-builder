Brace and bit,   hand-operated tool for boring holes in wood, consisting of a crank-shaped turning device, the brace, that grips and rotates the hole-cutting tool, the bit. The auger bit shown in the Figure is of the style traditionally used by carpenters; its six parts are shown in the Figure. At the end of the twist are two sharp points, called the spurs, that mark the circle, and two cutting edges, or lips, that cut shavings within the marked circle. The feed screw centres the bit and draws it into the wood. When in use, the tang is gripped in adjustable jaws in the shell, or chuck, of the brace. When drilling, one hand of the operator is placed on the head to push the bit into the wood while the other grips the handle and rotates the brace with a cranking action. A ratchet mechanism allows the brace to be rotated in one direction only by an oscillation of the bow; this mechanism is particularly useful when tightening or loosening screws using a screwdriver bit in place of an auger.
