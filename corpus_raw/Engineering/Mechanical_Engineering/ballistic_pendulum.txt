Ballistic pendulum,   device for measuring the velocity of a projectile, such as a bullet. A large wooden block suspended by two cords serves as the pendulum bob. When a bullet is fired into the bob, its momentum is transferred to the bob. The bulletâ€™s momentum can be determined from the amplitude of the pendulum swing. The velocity of the bullet, in turn, can be derived from its calculated momentum. The ballistic pendulum was invented by the British mathematician and military engineer Benjamin Robins, who described the device in his major work, New Principles of Gunnery (1742).
The ballistic pendulum has been largely supplanted by other devices for projectile velocity tests, but it is still used in classrooms for demonstrating concepts pertaining to momentum and energy.
