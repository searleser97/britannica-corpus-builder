Cam,   machine component that either rotates or moves back and forth (reciprocates) to create a prescribed motion in a contacting element known as a follower. The shape of the contacting surface of the cam is determined by the prescribed motion and the profile of the follower; the latter is usually flat or circular.
Cams are made in a variety of forms, such as: (1) a rotating disk or plate with the required profile; (2) a plate with a groove cut on its face to fit a roller on the follower (face cam); (3) a cylindrical or conical member with a follower groove cut around the surface; (4) a cylinder with the required profile cut in the end (end cam); (5) a reciprocating wedge of the required shape.
Cam-follower mechanisms are particularly useful when a simple motion of one part of a machine is to be converted to a more complicated prescribed motion of another part, one that must be accurately timed with respect to the simple motion and may include periods of rest (dwells). The motion of the camshaft in an automobile engine, for example, is a simple rotation that bears a fixed ratio to the crankshaft speed, whereas the valve motion produced by the cams is accurately timed relative to the crankshaft rotation and includes dwells during which the valves remain closed. Cams are essential elements in automatic machine tools, textile machinery, sewing machines, printing machines, and many others. If the follower is not restrained by a groove on the cam, a spring is necessary to keep the follower in contact with the cam.
