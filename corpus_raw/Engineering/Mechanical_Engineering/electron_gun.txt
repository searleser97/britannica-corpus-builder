Electron gun,  electrode structure that produces and may control, focus, and deflect a beam of electrons, as in a television picture tube (see figure), where the beam produces a visual pattern on the tubeâ€™s screen. The source of the electron beam is the cathode, a flat metal support covered with oxides of barium and strontium. When heated by a coil behind the support, these oxides emit electrons, which are drawn toward a positively charged sleeve (first anode) that is contoured to allow the electron beam to flow within the inside diameter. The beam is then electrostatically constricted and collimated by a metal disk with a hole (the control electrode) before it is directed to strike a phosphor-coated screen.
