Bren machine gun,  British adaptation of a Czech light machine gun. Its name originated as an acronym from Brno, where the Czech gun was made, and Enfield, where the British adaptation was made. Gas-operated and air-cooled, the Bren was first produced in 1937 and became one of the most widely used weapons of its type. During World War II it was produced in .303 calibre for British use, and it was manufactured in Canada as a 7.92-mm weapon for Chinese Nationalist troops.
Acclaimed as one of the best light machine guns of World War II, the Bren appeared in four models that varied principally in barrel length and total weight. The Mark 4 model had an overall length of 42.9 inches (109 cm), with a 22.25-inch (56.5-cm) barrel. It had a cyclic rate of fire of 520 rounds per minute, weighed 19 pounds (9 kg), and had an effective range of about 2,000 feet (600 metres). Easy to load, clean, and operate, it had variable-length bipods and a curved magazine. Its barrel could be changed quickly when it overheated in sustained-fire situations.
After the war the Bren gun was modified to fire the standard 7.62-mm NATO rifle round. By the end of the 20th century it had been replaced in first-line British service by the L7 series of 7.62-mm general purpose machine guns and by light support weapons firing NATOâ€™s 5.56-mm assault rifle round. Nevertheless, a version of the 7.62-mm Bren gun was produced by the Indian Ordnance Factories into the 21st century.
