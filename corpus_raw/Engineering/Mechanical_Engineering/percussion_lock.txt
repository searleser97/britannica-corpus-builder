Percussion lock,  in firearms, ignition system of small arms that utilizes an explosive that detonates when sharply struck. Discovered in 1805 by Alexander Forsyth (1786â€“1843), the percussion lock revolutionized firearms theory and opened the way to the development of self-contained metal cartridges and contact fuses in artillery shells. Forsyth found that potassium chlorate would explode when given a sharp blow. He made his first percussion lock with it by packing potassium chlorate in the port in the breech of the gun through which the flash of the primer ordinarily travelled. When the compound was struck smartly by the hammer, it exploded with a strong flash that ignited the main charge in the barrel.
Forsyth worked to improve his invention and adapt it to muskets of the day, but he received little support. In the year before his death, Great Britain and the United States finally began to manufacture military arms incorporating the percussion system.
