Shai Agassi,  (born April 19, 1968, Ramat Gan, Israel), Israeli entrepreneur who, after founding a number of technology companies, became known for Better Place, which sought to establish an infrastructure for electric automobiles.
Agassi graduated (1990) from Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) with a degree in computer science. In 1992 he founded TopTier Software, an information-portal provider. He also started several other businesses, including software companies Quicksoft (as cofounder) and TopManage. In 2001 TopTier was bought by SAP, a leading German software company, for $400 million. The following year Agassi joined the SAP executive board and became president of SAP’s Products and Technology Group. Known as a persuasive visionary with a command of the facts, he was invited (2005) to join the Forum of Young Global Leaders, organized by the World Economic Forum (Davos, Switzerland), and his involvement with the group led to his interest in climate change, especially in the area of transportation.
In 2007 Agassi left SAP and launched Better Place (originally named Project Better Place), a company that developed battery-exchange stations and recharging spots for electric cars so as to spur the public to replace their gasoline-powered cars. Agassi’s business plan positioned Better Place as a service company that would provide drivers with access to an electric-charging infrastructure on a subscription basis. By 2009 Better Place had agreements to install systems in a number of countries, including Israel, Denmark, and the United States (Hawaii and California). In 2012, however, Agassi stepped down as CEO of Better Place, and the company filed for bankruptcy the following year.
