Atoms for Peace speech,  speech delivered to the United Nations by U.S. Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower on December 8, 1953. In this address, Eisenhower spelled out the necessity of repurposing existing nuclear weapons technology to peaceful ends, stating that it must be humanity’s goal to discover “the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.” The speech marked one of the earliest calls to curb the global nuclear arms race, and it inspired the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1956.
