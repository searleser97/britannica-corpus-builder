Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton,  (born May 12, 1901, Tisbury, Wiltshire, England—died June 22, 1983, London), engineer who was a leading figure in the development of the nuclear energy industry in Britain; he supervised the construction of Calder Hall, the world’s first large-scale nuclear power station (opened in 1956).
Hinton was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge (1923–26), and in the late 1920s and the 1930s he held various governmental posts. He joined the Ministry of Supply at the beginning of World War II and in 1946 became deputy controller of nuclear energy production. He was thus involved in Britain’s newly created, full-scale nuclear research program. From the outset Hinton stressed the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and his efforts were directly responsible for the growing cooperation between the United States and Great Britain in this area. In 1954 Britain created the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, and Hinton was appointed managing director (1954–57) of the industrial group of this body.
Hinton was knighted in 1951 and made a Knight of the British Empire in 1957. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1954 and in 1958 became chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board. He was created a life peer in 1965.
