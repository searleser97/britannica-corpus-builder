James Smith McDonnell, in full James Smith McDonnell, Jr.,  (born April 9, 1899, Denver, Colorado, U.S.—died August 22, 1980, St. Louis, Missouri), American aerospace executive who spearheaded the merger of McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Douglas Aircraft Company in 1967.
McDonnell, who held a master’s degree in aeronautical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, first designed (1928) the Doodlebug, a small monoplane for private pilots. In 1939 he founded McDonnell Aircraft Corporation, which prospered from military contracts secured during World War II. In 1946 McDonnell sold the U.S. Navy the FH-I Phantom, the world’s first carrier-based jet fighter. He later enhanced his reputation as a supplier of jet fighters with a succession of Phantoms, Banshees, Demons, and Voodoos. McDonnell began work on a manned orbital craft a year before the National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded his company the contract (1959) to produce Mercury, which carried the first U.S. astronaut into orbit. In 1961 he won the contract to assemble the Gemini capsule —the first two-man spacecraft.
After the 1967 merger of McDonnell Aircraft with the failing Douglas Aircraft, McDonnell Douglas Corporation became one of the largest manufacturers of military aircraft in the U.S. The company continued to grow during McDonnell’s chairmanship, but it was plagued in the late 1970s and 1980 with lawsuits and the loss of contracts after several of its DC-10 commercial airplanes were involved in crashes. An energetic worker, McDonnell retired as chairman (1967–80) of the firm a month before his death.
