Percy Sinclair Pilcher,  (born January 1866â€”died Oct. 2, 1899, Leicestershire, Eng.), British aviation pioneer and glider experimenter.
Trained as a naval cadet, Pilcher served for six years as a midshipman before beginning an apprenticeship with a Glasgow shipbuilding firm. In 1893 he found employment as an assistant lecturer to a professor of marine engineering and naval architecture at Glasgow University. By 1895 he was working as a university lecturer and as a draftsman with a local shipyard. In April 1896 he resigned his university post and accepted a job as assistant to Hiram Maxim, the well-known London-based flying machine experimenter.
Inspired by reports of the work of the Prussian aviator Otto Lilienthal, whom he twice visited in Germany, Pilcher began his own glider experiments in 1895. Over the next four years, he would complete a series of gliders: Bat (1895), Beetle (1895), Gull (1896), and Hawk (1896). During his short career as an active aeronautical experimenter, he met or corresponded with world leaders in the field, including, in addition to Lilienthal and Maxim, Octave Chanute and Lawrence Hargrave.
Apparently inspired by Chanute and the American Arthur Herring, he gave considerable thought to the design of aeronautical power plants and powered aircraft during the last two years of his life. Pilcher was fatally injured in a crash with his Hawk at Stanford Park, near Market Harborough, on Sept. 30, 1899.
