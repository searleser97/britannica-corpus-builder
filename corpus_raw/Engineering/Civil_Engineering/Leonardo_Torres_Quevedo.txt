Leonardo Torres Quevedo,  (born Dec. 28, 1852, Santa Cruz, Spainâ€”died Dec. 18, 1936, Madrid), Spanish engineer. In 1890 he introduced an electromagnetic device capable of playing a limited form of chess. Though it did not always play the best moves and sometimes took much longer than a competent human player to win, it demonstrated the capability of machines to be programmed to follow specified rules (heuristics) and marked the beginnings of research into the development of artificial intelligence.
