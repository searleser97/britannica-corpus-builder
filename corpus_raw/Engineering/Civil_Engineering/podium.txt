Podium, plural podiums, or podia,  in architecture, any of various elements that form the “foot,” or base, of a structure, such as a raised pedestal or base, a low wall supporting columns, or the structurally or decoratively emphasized lowest portion of a wall. Sometimes the basement story of a building may be treated as a podium. The podium is usually designed with a modeled base and plinth at the bottom; a central surface known as a die, or dado; and a projecting cornice, or cap. Major Roman examples can be seen in the Maison Carrée (c. 12 bc) in Nîmes, France, and the Temple of Fortuna Virilis (c. 40 bc) in the Forum Boarium at Rome.
