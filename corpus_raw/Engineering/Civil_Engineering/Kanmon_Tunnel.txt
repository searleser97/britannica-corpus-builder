Kanmon Tunnel,   world’s first under-ocean tunnel, stretching 2.25 miles (about 3.5 km) between the islands of Honshu and Kyushu in Japan. During its construction (1936–44), nearly every known tunneling technique was employed: rock tunneling by drilling and blasting, shield tunneling in soft ground, tunneling with compressed air, and the immersed-tube method involving the sinking of pneumatic caissons. In the 1950s a highway and pedestrian tunnel was constructed east of the original rail tunnel; following a slightly shorter route and using improved equipment, it was completed with little difficulty.
