Grand Canal dâ€™Alsace, English Great Alsace Canal,  waterway along the Rhine River, in eastern France, designed in 1922. The first section, at Kembs, opened in 1932, and three more pairs of locks were built between 1952 and 1959. The canal is now 50 km (30 miles) long and permits navigation between Basel, Switzerland, and Breisach, Germany. It was built to improve navigation of the Rhine (hindered by shallows and a rapid current) and thus to increase traffic upstream from Strasbourg. Hydroelectric power is generated at the locks, the largest of each pair being 185 by 23 metres (600 by 75 feet).
