Ralph Adams Cram,  (born Dec. 16, 1863, Hampton Falls, N.H., U.S.—died  Sept. 22, 1942, Boston), architect and writer, the foremost Gothic revival architect in the United States.
Inspired by the influential English critic John Ruskin, Cram became an ardent advocate of and authority on English and French Gothic styles. In 1888 he opened an architectural firm in Boston, where he became associated with B.G. Goodhue and later with F.W. Ferguson. Together they designed St. Thomas’ Church (New York City), Euclid Avenue Presbyterian Church (Cleveland), the First Baptist Church (Pittsburgh), and many other major churches, as well as the buildings of the United States Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. Cram and Ferguson transformed the Cathedral of St. John the Divine (New York City) from a Romanesque to a late Gothic building, making it one of the great cathedrals of the world.
Cram attempted to create buildings that would convey spiritual values as a corrective to technological civilization. He insisted that educational buildings be Gothic and designed the graduate college (1913) and chapel (1929) at Princeton University in this style. His influence helped establish Gothic as the standard style for the American college and university buildings of the period. He also designed buildings in other styles, including Classical, Byzantine, and American Colonial. Cram was professor of architecture at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1914 to 1921.
He wrote many scholarly and articulate books on architecture, aesthetics, and sociology, including Church Building (1901); The Gothic Quest (1907); The Ministry of Art (1914); The Substance of Gothic (1916); The Nemesis of Mediocrity (1918); My Life in Architecture (1936); and The End of Democracy (1937).
