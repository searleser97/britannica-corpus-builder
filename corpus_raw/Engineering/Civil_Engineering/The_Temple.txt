The Temple,  in London, series of buildings associated with the legal profession. The Temple lies between Fleet Street and the Embankment in the City of London and is mainly divided into the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple, two of the four Inns of Court, which are controlled by their respective barristers’ societies. The complex of buildings is named for the Knights Templar, a medieval religious and military order that once owned the property.
 The Temple Church on the site dates to the late 12th century, though it has often been restored. Within its crypt the Templars carried out their secret initiation ceremonies. With the suppression of the Templars in the 14th century, the Knights of Malta obtained control of the property. Law professors subsequently began to rent a portion of the space, and in the early 17th century James I granted control of the complex to their societies. Each section of The Temple—Inner and Middle—has its own halls, gardens, courts, and library collections, but the Temple Church (1185) is held in common by both. To the northwest, in the City of Westminster, are the Royal Courts of Justice, while in Holborn (Camden borough) are the two other Inns of Court—Lincoln’s Inn and Gray’s Inn.
