Sodium-vapour lamp,  electric discharge lamp using ionized sodium, used for street lighting and other illumination. A low-pressure sodium-vapour (LPS) lamp contains an inner discharge tube made of borosilicate glass that is fitted with metal electrodes and filled with neon and argon gas and a little metallic sodium. When current passes between the electrodes, it ionizes the neon and argon, giving a red glow until the hot gas vaporizes the sodium. The vapourized sodium ionizes and shines a nearly monochrome yellow. LPS lamps have been used widely for street lighting since the 1930s because of their efficiency (measured in lumens per watt) and the ability of their yellow light to penetrate fog. High-pressure sodium-vapour (HPS) lamps have an inner discharge tube made of translucent alumina that can withstand the corrosive effects of a mixture of mercury and sodium under greater pressure and higher temperature. HPS lamps give a whiter light and are used for extra-bright lighting in places such as road intersections, tunnels, sports stadiums, and other places where it is desirable to see a full spectrum of reflected colours.
