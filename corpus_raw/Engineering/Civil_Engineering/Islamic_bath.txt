Islāmic bath, Arabic Ḥammān,  public bathing establishment developed in countries under Islāmic rule that reflects the fusion of a primitive Eastern bath tradition and the elaborate Roman bathing process. A typical bath house consists of a series of rooms, each varying in temperature according to the height and shape of the domed roof and to the room’s distance from the furnace. Each series of rooms is composed of a warm room, a hot room, and a steam room, corresponding roughly to the tepidarium, caldarium, and laconicum of the Roman thermae. In some bathhouses, the cold room, or frigidarium, is replaced by a basin of cold water at one end of the warm room. In addition to these vaulted chambers, there are dressing rooms and frequently a luxurious rest area, where refreshments are served after bath and massage. Separate facilities for men and women are provided.
Some Islāmic baths are opulently decorated with mosaics, fountains, and pools. Excellent examples can be seen in the Alhambra in Granada, Spain (1358); the Citadel at Aleppo, Syria (1367); and the Haseki Hürrem Ḥammān in Istanbul (1556).
