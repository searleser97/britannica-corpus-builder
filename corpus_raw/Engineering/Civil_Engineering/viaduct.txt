Viaduct,  type of long bridge or series of bridges, usually supported by a series of arches or on spans between tall towers. The purpose of a viaduct is to carry a road or railway over water, a valley, or another road. The viaduct is both functionally and etymologically related to the aqueduct, which carries water; both were developed by Roman engineers.
The long spans of Roman viaducts were supported by semicircular arches resting on piers of stone or masonry. A well-preserved example is the span over the Tagus River at Alcantara, Spain (c. 105 ce). The next advance in viaduct construction did not occur until the late 18th-century development of iron bridges and the 19th-century introduction of steel.
In the early 20th century the spread of reinforced-concrete construction led to the building of concrete arch structures. A recent method used on long viaducts is segmental construction. The sections are precast and jacked forward from one end of the viaduct to form the extension.
