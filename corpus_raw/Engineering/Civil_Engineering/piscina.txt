Piscina,   in Roman times, an artificial reservoir used for swimming or as a fish pond. During the Middle Ages a piscina was a pool or tank in which fish were stored by monastic communities, for whose members fish was a staple item of diet.
Although never a calculated feature of gardens, existing ponds or fish stews (tanks) were sometimes later incorporated in decorative schemes. At Monticello, Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s home near Charlottesville, Va., an original piscina has been restored.
A stone vessel having a drain that leads directly to the ground, located near an altar of a church, and used for disposing of water from ablutions is also known as a piscina.
