Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, also called Akashi Strait Bridge or Pearl Bridge,  suspension bridge across the Akashi Strait (Akashi-kaikyo) in west-central Japan. It was the world’s longest suspension bridge when it opened on April 5, 1998. The six-lane road bridge connects the city of Kōbe, on the main island of Honshu, to Iwaya, on Awaji Island, which in turn is linked (via the Ōnaruto Bridge over the Naruto Strait) to the island of Shikoku to the southwest. These two bridges—together with the Seto Great Bridge between Kojima (Honshu) and Sakaide (Shikoku)—are the main components of the Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Project across Japan’s Inland Sea.
The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge is 3,911 metres (12,831 feet) long and has three spans. The central span is 1,991 metres (6,532 feet) long, and each of the two side spans measures 960 metres (3,150 feet). The two main supporting towers stand 297 metres (975 feet) above the strait’s surface, making it one of the tallest bridges in the world. The central span was originally designed to be 1,990 metres (6,529 feet) long, but the Kōbe earthquake of 1995 forced the two towers, which were still under construction, more than 1 metre (3 feet) farther apart.
The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge stands in a seismically unstable region that also experiences some of Earth’s most severe storms. Thus, engineers used a complex system of counterweights, pendulums, and steel-truss girders to allow the bridge to withstand winds of up to 290 km (180 miles) per hour. Despite these buffers, the bridge can expand and contract up to 2 metres (6.5 feet) in a single day. The challenges posed by the bridge inspired innovations in wind-tunnel and cable-fabrication technology.
