Engineering studies,  multidisciplinary branch of engineering that examines the relationships between technical and nontechnical aspects of engineering practices. Engineering studies encompasses a wide range of scholarly work that seeks to understand what it means to be an engineer and what is conveyed by “engineering work” in different historical and cultural settings through the lenses of history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and gender studies. The field may also encompass the political, economic, and managerial issues associated with carrying out an engineering project. The International Network for Engineering Studies (INES), which also operates the journal Engineering Studies, was first established in Paris in 2004.
One of the field’s central findings is that the terms engineer and engineering knowledge have significantly different connotations across various national contexts. By applying the lessons drawn from the study of the origin and development of engineering during the past two centuries, engineering studies scholars are able to address the contemporary stakes with respect to engineering education, epistemology (the study of various aspects of human knowledge), and the development of the discipline itself.
Historically, most scholars have viewed engineering communities in terms of a few features, such as technological innovation, professionalization, social responsibility, and adoption of new engineering ideas and practices. Although engineering studies embraces many of those themes, it largely departs from earlier scholarship on the basis of two premises: (1) engineering is a cultural project continually searching for relevance and social legitimacy, and (2) what counts as engineering knowledge in different times and locations and what ultimately comes to constitute the relevant community of engineering practitioners are produced on the basis of some commonly shared stimuli, or images. The latter premise, given the modern challenges brought by globalization, questions the engineers’ perceptions of self, as well as their understanding of engineering’s role in society.
