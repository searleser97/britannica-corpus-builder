Intercolumniation,  in architecture, space between columns that supports an arch or an entablature (an assemblage of moldings and bands that forms the lowest horizontal beam of a roof). In Classical architecture and its derivatives, Renaissance and Baroque architecture, intercolumniation was determined from a system codified by the 1st-century bc Roman architect Vitruvius.
The measurement between columns was calculated and expressed in terms of the diameters of the columns in the buildingâ€”i.e., two columns were expressed as being 3 diameters (3D) rather than 9 feet (2.7 metres) apart. This system by Vitruvius conveniently and universally expressed the measurement of a particular unit of space, the size of which varied from building to building, according to the Classical order used.
Vitruvius established five standard measurements for intercolumniation: 11/2 diameter interval (D), called pycnostyle intercolumniation; 2D, called systyle; 21/4D (the most common ratio), called eustyle; 3D, called diastyle; and 4 or more D, called araeostyle.
Although the five standard ratios prevailed, variations in actual building practice frequently occurred. In Doric temples the intercolumniation at the corners was sometimes half as wide as the intercolumniation along the front and lateral sides of the building.
In Japanese architecture, intercolumniation is based on a standard unit, the ken, which is divided into 20 sections, each termed a minute of space; each minute is subdivided into 22 units, or seconds.
