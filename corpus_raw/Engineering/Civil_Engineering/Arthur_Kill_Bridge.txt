Arthur Kill Bridge,  steel vertical-lift bridge, completed in 1959, spanning the Arthur Kill (channel) between Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Staten Island, New York. The movable section, suspended from two 215-foot- (66-metre-) high towers, is 558 feet (170 metres) long and can be raised 135 feet (41 metres) above the water to allow ships to pass beneath it. It carries a single railroad track and, at its completion, was the longest and highest span of its type in the world. See also movable bridge.
