Choragic monument,  large, freestanding pedestal that formed the display base for an athletic or choral prize won at an ancient Greek festival. Although the only surviving example is the choragic Monument of Lysicrates, or Lamp of Diogenes, erected in Athens in 334 bc, literary evidence of the existence of others may be found in Virgil’s Aeneid.
Erected in honour of victory at the Great (or City) Dionysia festival, the Monument of Lysicrates has a 9.5-foot- (2.9-metre-) square foundation that is 13 feet (4 metres) high and is topped by a circular edifice 21 feet (6.4 metres) high made of Pentelic marble. Upon this edifice rests a circular structure supported by six Corinthian columns—the earliest surviving examples of that order. The entablature of the monument supports a shallow dome, which in turn is the base of three scrolls intended to hold the tripod trophy (now missing). A frieze on the entablature shows the Tyrrhenian pirates being turned into dolphins by the god Dionysus.
Another choragic monument, the Monument of Thrasyllus (319 bc), no longer exists, but it was imitated in other funerary structures, including the Bazouin mausoleum at Père-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Architects of the 18th century who worked in the Neoclassical style borrowed details of the choragic monuments for decorative elements around doors and windows.
