Grand Coulee Dam,  gravity dam on the Columbia River in the state of Washington, U.S. It was originally a project of the Federal Bureau of Reclamation. The main structure and power plant were completed in 1941, but not all the generators were installed until 1942. The largest and most complex of a series of dams on the Columbia River, the Grand Coulee provides irrigation to the Columbia Basin Project, assists in flood control, simplifies navigation, and furnishes hydroelectric power. The dam also funds three fish hatcheries in an attempt to mitigate the loss of fish, particularly Chinook salmon and steelhead, above the dam.
The dam rises 550 feet (168 metres) above bedrock and originally measured 3,867 feet (1,179 metres) along its crest. It was subsequently restructured into an L shape measuring 5,223 feet (1,592 metres) along the crest of the main, forebay, and wing dams. Some 11,975,500 cubic yards (9,156,400 cubic metres) of concrete are in the entire structure. Installed power capacity is 6,809 megawatts. The dam creates a reservoir, Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, that has a storage capacity of about 9,562,000 acre-feet (11,795,000,000 cubic metres).
