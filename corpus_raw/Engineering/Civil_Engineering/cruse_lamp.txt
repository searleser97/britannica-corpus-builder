Cruse lamp,   small, iron hanging lamp with a handle at one end and a pinched spout for a wick at the other. It had a round bowl, about 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter and 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. The fuel used in it was probably hard fat.
The cruse lamp was a development from floating-wick pan lamps used by Mediterranean peoples in pre-Christian times. It was used intermittently in Europe, first during the Middle Ages and then in the 18th century, as an alternative to rushlights (candles made of the pith of various rushes and dipped in grease) and candles.
