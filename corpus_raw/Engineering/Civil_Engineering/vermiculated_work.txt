Vermiculated work,   in masonry, the carving or finishing of building stones with irregular grooves intended to resemble worm tracks. Vermiculation is one form of surface rustication, the intention of which is to create a decorative contrast between the rusticated work, ordinarily confined to the lowest story of a building, and the finely dressed ashlar above.
Vermiculated rustics may be found in several areas of the Louvre, Paris. It has frequently been simulated in floor tile, stucco, and other compositions.
