Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers, (French: “National Conservatory of Arts and Trades”; CNAM)  public institution of higher learning in Paris, dedicated to applied science and technology, that grants degrees primarily in engineering. It is also a laboratory that specializes in testing, measuring, and standardization. Its third component is a national museum of technology. It was founded by Jacques de Vaucanson in 1794, in the former priory of St.-Martin-des-Champs, to house his own and others’ inventions; his automated loom, found there after his death by J.-M. Jacquard, became the basis for Jacquard’s revolutionary design. It contains numerous elaborate automatons and other mechanical devices popular in the 18th century.
