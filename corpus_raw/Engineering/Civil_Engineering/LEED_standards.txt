LEED® standards, in full Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards,  a certification program devised in 1994 by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC; founded 1993) to encourage sustainable practices design and development by means of tools and criteria for performance measurement. It is “a voluntary, consensus-based, market-driven building rating system based on existing proven technology.” The USGBC has established standards for new construction and major renovation as well as existing structures; their standards can be applied to core and shell and to commercial interiors—i.e., the core and shell alone can be certified with no requirement that the interior be so certified. Many building types—schools, offices, retail, health care facilities, and private residences—have been addressed, and standards for neighbourhood development are also in progress.
The five critical areas of focus, as laid out by the USGBC, are “sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection, and indoor environmental quality.”
LEED ratings in order of value from lowest to highest, based on the number of points assigned for green compliance, are Certified, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.
