UPC, in full universal product code,  a standard machine-readable bar code used to identify products purchased in grocery and other retail stores.
UPCs encode individual products at the stock keeping unit (SKU) level, allowing a manufacturer or retailer to track the number of units sold during a specified time period. This type of tracking can be an important aspect of just-in-time inventory management. The UPC is maintained by the Uniform Code Council (UCC), a nonprofit organization located in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, U.S. Founded in 1972, the UCC administers the UPC for more than 200,000 companies around the world.
