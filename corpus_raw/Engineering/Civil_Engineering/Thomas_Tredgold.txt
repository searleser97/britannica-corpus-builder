Thomas Tredgold,  (born Aug. 22, 1788, Brandon, near Durham, Eng.â€”died Jan. 28, 1829, London), English engineer and writer.
Almost entirely self-taught, after some years of journeyman work he published Elementary Principles of Carpentry (1820), which became an enduring classic. It was followed by important treatises on cast iron and other metals (1822), ventilation and warming of buildings (1824), railroads and carriages (1825), and steam engines (1827).
