George Bass,  (born Jan. 30, 1771, Aswarby, Lincolnshire, Eng.—died  1803, at sea en route from Australia to South America), surgeon and sailor who was important in the early coastal survey of Australia.
Bass was apprenticed as a surgeon and in 1789 accepted in the Company of Surgeons. He joined the Royal Navy, where his proficiency in navigation and seamanship and interest in Pacific exploration led to his transfer to the ship Reliance, on which Matthew Flinders was mate. When the ship reached Port Jackson (in what is now New South Wales) in 1795, Bass, Flinders, and Bass’s personal servant William Martin explored the George’s River and Botany Bay and recommended a settlement, which was made at Banks Town. In 1796 the three unsuccessfully sought a river south of Botany Bay and discovered and explored Port Hocking. Bass also studied the animals and plants of the region. In 1797 Bass explored the coast south of Sydney and confirmed reports of coal there. Later in the year and in 1798 he determined the existence of a strait—which was named for him—between New South Wales and Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania). In 1799 Bass was elected to the Linnean Society of London for his field collections and writings.
Bass then turned to commercial ventures, although he continued to chart wherever he sailed. In 1803 he sailed with a cargo from Sydney bound for South America and was never heard of again.
