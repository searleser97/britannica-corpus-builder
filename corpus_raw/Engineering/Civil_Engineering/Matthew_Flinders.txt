Matthew Flinders,  (born March 16, 1774, Donington, Lincolnshire, England—died July 19, 1814, London), English navigator who charted much of the Australian coast.
Flinders entered the Royal Navy in 1789 and became a navigator. In 1795 he sailed to Australia, where he explored and charted its southeast coast and circumnavigated the island of Tasmania. As commander of the Investigator, he again sailed from England for Australia in 1801. On this visit he surveyed the entire southern coast, from Cape Leeuwin, in the southwest, to the Bass Strait, which separates mainland Australia from Tasmania. On July 22, 1802, he sailed from Sydney (on Port Jackson) and charted the east coast of Australia and the Gulf of Carpentaria on the north coast. Continuing westward and southward, he circumnavigated Australia and again reached Port Jackson on June 9, 1803.
In December, on the voyage back to England, the condition of his ship required him to stop at the Île de France (now Mauritius) in the western Indian Ocean. There he was interned by the French authorities and was not allowed to leave for England until 1810. His Voyage to Terra Australis appeared shortly before his death.
Flinders’s remains were among the tens of thousands of bodies interred at the St. James Gardens cemetery in London in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The construction of a high-speed rail line between London and Birmingham necessitated the excavation of that burial site, and in January 2019 archaeologists uncovered Flinders’s coffin. Flinders’s skeleton would be subjected to scientific analysis before being reinterred at a different location.
