Kremlin, Russian kreml, formerly kremnik,  central fortress in medieval Russian cities, usually located at a strategic point along a river and separated from the surrounding parts of the city by a wooden—later a stone or brick—wall with ramparts, a moat, towers, and battlements. Several capitals of principalities (e.g., Moscow, Pskov, Novgorod, Smolensk, Rostov, Suzdal, Yaroslavl, Vladimir, and Nizhny Novgorod) were built around old kremlins, which generally contained cathedrals, palaces for princes and bishops, governmental offices, and munitions stores.
The original Moscow Kremlin dates from 1156. The oldest remaining section dates from the 14th–15th century and is located in the southwest portion of the current complex, which is triangular in shape and covers an area of some 70 acres (28 hectares). It lost its importance as a fortress in the 1620s but was used as the centre of Russian government until 1712 and again after 1918. Originally constructed of wood, the Moscow Kremlin was rebuilt in white stone in the 14th century and then totally rebuilt in red brick in the late 15th century by Italian architects. It has since been repaired and altered on numerous occasions. Its architecture thus reflects its long history and encompasses a variety of styles, including Byzantine, Russian Baroque, and classical. The structure is triangular in shape. Its east side faces Red Square, and it has four gateways and a postern (back gate), concealing a secret passage to the Moscow River. Following the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917, the Moscow Kremlin became the headquarters of Vladimir Lenin’s Soviet government and the symbol of the communist dictatorship. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it became the executive headquarters of the Russian federation. The Moscow Kremlin and the adjacent Red Square were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1990. For more detail, see Moscow.
