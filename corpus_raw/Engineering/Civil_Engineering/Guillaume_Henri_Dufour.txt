Guillaume-Henri Dufour,  (born September 15, 1787, Konstanz, Austrian Empire [now in Germany]—died July 14, 1875, Les Contamines, near Geneva, Switzerland), engineer and army officer who was elected four times to supreme command of the Swiss army.
After studying in Geneva, at the École Polytechnique in Paris, and at the École du Génie in Metz, Dufour served in Napoleon’s army, defending Corfu in 1813 and taking part in the campaigns in France in 1814. He resigned in 1817 and returned to Switzerland, where he was appointed ingénieur cantonal, supervising the construction of public works that greatly improved Geneva. He also helped to form the military school at Thun in 1819, where he became chief instructor. Appointed chief of staff of the Swiss army in 1831, he commanded a division sent to restore order in Basel in 1833. In the same year, he began his pioneer topographical survey of Switzerland (published 1842–64). In 1847 Dufour was elected general of the federal army to act against the separatist confederation of Roman Catholic cantons known as the Sonderbund, and he displayed skill and moderation in its suppression. He was elected general for the second time in 1849 to maintain Swiss neutrality in the face of insurgents from Baden; again in 1857, during the conflict with Prussia over Neuchâtel; and finally in 1859, when the French were about to annex Savoy. He presided over the international congress in Geneva in 1864 that drew up the convention for the wounded in time of war and resulted in the creation of the Red Cross. He also sat in the federal assembly as a Conservative.
