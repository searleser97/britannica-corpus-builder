Mangla Dam,  embankment dam on the Jhelum River near Jhelum, Pakistan. Mangla Dam, completed in 1967, is one of the main structures in the Indus Basin Project (another is Tarbela Dam).
When it was completed, the dam structure rose 453 feet (138 metres) above ground level, was about 10,300 feet (3,140 metres) wide at its crest, and had a volume of 85.5 million cubic yards (65.4 million cubic metres). Along with its three small subsidiary dams, it had an initial installed power capacity of at least 600 megawatts, which was increased to 1,000 megawatts in the mid-1990s. Although its impounded reservoir originally had a gross capacity of about 5.9 million acre-feet (about 7.3 billion cubic metres), the amount of water impounded gradually diminished because of silting. A five-year project, completed in 2009, raised the height of the dam by 30 feet (9 metres), raising its storage capacity to some 7.4 million acre-feet (9.13 billion cubic metres).
