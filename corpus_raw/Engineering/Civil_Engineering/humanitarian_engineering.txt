Humanitarian engineering,  the application of engineering to improving the well-being of marginalized people and disadvantaged communities, usually in the developing world. Humanitarian engineering typically focuses on programs that are affordable, sustainable, and based on local resources. Projects are typically community-driven and cross-disciplinary, and they focus on finding simple solutions to basic needs (such as close access to clean water; adequate heat, shelter, and sanitation; and reliable pathways to markets).
A prominent humanitarian engineering organization is Engineers Without Borders USA (EWB-USA), which was founded in 2002 by civil engineer Bernard Amadei. Both the organization and the field have grown rapidly since then, and many American universities host EWB-USA chapters. Such chapters frequently include both undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty from such departments as engineering, public health, urban planning, and public affairs; foreign language proficiency and social entrepreneurial skills are highly valued. As of 2020, there were about 9,500 EWB-USA members operating in nearly 40 countries.
