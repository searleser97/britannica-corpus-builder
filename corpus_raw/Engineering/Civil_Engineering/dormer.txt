Dormer,   in architecture, a vertical window that projects from a sloping roof and usually illuminates a bedroom. The term derives from the Latin dormitorium, “sleeping room.” Dormers are set either on the face of the wall or high upon the roof, and their roofs may be gabled, hipped, flat, or with one slope. A small dormer in a roof or a spire is called a lucarne.
Simple dormers, frequently constructed in several rows, characterize the steep roofs of Teutonic countries. In the late Gothic and early Renaissance periods, more elaborate masonry dormers were designed that extended up from the wall line of the building and were richly decorated.
Similar elaborate dormers, usually with gabled roofs, characterize the Tudor work in England and Scotland and the French château from the time of Louis XII to that of Louis XIV. Dormers continued to be used throughout the 17th and 18th centuries and were especially popular in revival-style buildings of the 19th and 20th centuries.
