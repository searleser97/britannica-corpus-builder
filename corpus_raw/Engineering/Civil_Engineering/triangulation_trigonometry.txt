Triangulation,  in navigation, surveying, and civil engineering, a technique for precise determination of a ship’s or aircraft’s position, and the direction of roads, tunnels, or other structures under construction. It is based on the laws of plane trigonometry, which state that, if one side and two angles of a triangle are known, the other two sides and angle can be readily calculated. One side of the selected triangle is measured; this is the baseline. The two adjacent angles are measured by means of a surveying device known as a theodolite, and the entire triangle is established. By constructing a series of such triangles, each adjacent to at least one other triangle, values can be obtained for distances and angles not otherwise measurable. Triangulation was used by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and other peoples at a very early date, with crude sighting devices that were improved into the diopter, or dioptra (an early theodolite), and were described in the 1st century ad by Heron of Alexandria.
