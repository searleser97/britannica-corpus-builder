Escalator,  moving staircase used as transportation between floors or levels in subways, buildings, and other mass pedestrian areas.
An inclined belt, invented by Jesse W. Reno of the United States in 1891, provided transportation for passengers riding on cleats attached to the belt, which was inclined at an angle of 25°; the handrail was stationary, but an improved version with a moving handrail was introduced the same year.
The name escalator was first applied to a moving stairway shown at the Paris Exposition of 1900. Originally a trademark of the Otis Elevator Company, the word was adjudged in 1949 to have become public property through popular use.
Modern escalators are usually inclined at 30°, limited in rise to about 60 feet (18 m), with floor-to-floor rise of about 12 feet (3.5 m). They are electrically powered, driven by chain and sprocket, and held in the proper plane by two tracks. As the treads approach the landing, they pass through a comb device; a deflection switch is actuated to cut off power if an object becomes jammed between the tread and the comb.
Escalators move at a rate of up to 120 feet (36 m) per minute; larger types have a capacity of 6,000 passengers per hour. If a chain breaks, the release of tension stops the escalator. A safety switch also halts the device if a handrail is broken or comes loose or if a side panel is deflected.
Moving ramps or sidewalks, sometimes called travelators, are specialized forms of escalators developed to carry people and materials horizontally or along slight inclines. Ramps may have either solid or jointed treads or a continuous belt. Ramps can move at any angle of up to 15°; beyond this incline the slope becomes too steep and escalators are favoured.
