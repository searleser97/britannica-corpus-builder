Bungalow,  single-storied house with a sloping roof, usually small and often surrounded by a veranda. The name derives from a Hindi word meaning “a house in the Bengali style” and came into English during the era of the British administration of India. In Great Britain the name became a derisive one because of the spread of poorly built bungalow-type houses there. The style, however, gained popularity in housing developments of American towns during the 1920s. Its general design—with high ceilings, large doors and windows, and shade-giving eaves or verandas—makes it especially well suited for hot climates, and bungalows are still frequently built as summer cottages or as homes in warm regions such as southern California.
