Gopura, also spelled gopuram,  in south Indian architecture, the entrance gateway to a Hindu temple enclosure. Relatively small at first, the gopuras grew in size from the mid-12th century until the colossal gateways came to dominate the temple complex, quite surpassing the main sanctum in both size and architectural elaboration. Often a series of gopuras are to be found at a shrine, each providing entry through a new enclosure wall.
The gopura is generally constructed with a stone base and a superstructure of brick and pilaster. It is rectangular in plan and topped by a barrel-vault roof. The exterior walls are covered with sculpture. Among outstanding examples of gopuras are the Sundara Pandya gopura of the Jambukeshvara temple at Tiruchchirappalli, Tamil Nadu state, and the successive gopuras of the Shiva temple at Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu state (12thâ€“13th century).
