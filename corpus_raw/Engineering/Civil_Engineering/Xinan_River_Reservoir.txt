Xin’an River Reservoir, Chinese (Pinyin) Xin’anjiang Shuiku, or (Wade-Giles) romanization Hsin-an Chiang Shui-k’u,  large artificial lake near the town of Xin’anjiang, northwestern Zhejiang province, southeastern China. It was created as part of a large hydroelectric project constructed between 1957 and 1977. The project, started with considerable Soviet technical assistance, was not completed for some time, the delay apparently resulting from that assistance being withdrawn from China about 1960. On its completion, the project was hailed as a triumph of Chinese technology. Its main component is a dam 344 feet (105 metres) high and 1,525 feet (465 metres) long built on the Xin’an River (a tributary of the Fuchun River) at Xin’anjiang, close to Jiande. This formed a reservoir about 60 miles (100 km) long and more than 6 miles (10 km) wide in places, with an area of about 225 square miles (580 square km).
The project was originally conceived as forming one of a series of hydroelectric stations in Zhejiang. By 1980 the dam’s four 72,500-kilowatt generators were in operation, and five additional generators were eventually added at nearby Huangtankou, bringing the river project to its planned capacity of more than 650,000 kilowatts. The Xin’an and the Huangtankou stations are linked to the power grid serving Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, and the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) delta region.
