Megaron,   in ancient Greece and the Middle East, architectural form consisting of an open porch, a vestibule, and a large hall with a central hearth and a throne. The megaron was found in all Mycenaean palaces and was also built as part of houses. It seemingly originated in the Middle East, attaining a peculiarly Aegean aspect because of its open porch, which was usually supported by columns. Early Greek architecture used the megaron, and it also became an important element in the Classical temple. A typical megaron plan is that of the palace of Nestor at Pylos, where the large main unit apparently served as royal living quarters. It faced onto the usual courtyard, which was entered through a decorative gateway with fluted columns on either side.
