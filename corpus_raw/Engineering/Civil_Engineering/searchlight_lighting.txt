Searchlight,   high-intensity electric light with a reflector shaped to concentrate the beam, used to illuminate or search for distant objects or as a beacon.
Carbon arc lamps have been used from about 1870 and from about 1910 rare-earth fluorides or oxides have been added to the carbon to create exceptional brilliance. About 1877 Col. Alphonse Mangin of the French Army invented a double spherical glass mirror that was widely employed in searchlights until about 1885, when the parabolic reflector came into use. For military use, the reflector is generally metal.
The largest modern searchlights still employ carbon arcs. Smaller searchlights are incandescent and electric discharge lamps.
