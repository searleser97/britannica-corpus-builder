Cornerstone,   ceremonial building block, usually placed ritually in the outer wall of a building to commemorate its dedication. Sometimes the stone is solid, with date or other inscription. More typically, it is hollowed out to contain metal receptacles for newspapers, photographs, currency, books, or other documents reflecting current customs, with a view to their historical use when the building is remodeled or demolished.
Until the development of modern construction, the stone was usually at a corner, possibly as the first of the foundation stones, and it was a real support. The modern cornerstone need not actually support, need not be positioned at a corner, and need not be part of the foundation; often it is placed ornamentally in the facade or in an interior wall or floor.
From the original position and function of the cornerstone arose figures of speech in many languages referring to cornerstones or foundation stones of character, faith, liberty, or other excellences. Early customs connected with cornerstones were related to study of the stars and their religious significance. Buildings were laid out with astronomical precision in relation to points of the compass, with emphasis on corners. Cornerstones symbolized “seeds” from which buildings would germinate and rise.
Various religious rituals and Bible references spread and perpetuated the cornerstone custom. Ceremonies have been marked with processions, sacrifices, sprinklings of blood and water, and wide participation by rulers, priests, and other dignitaries who used the mason’s trowel, often made of gold or silver.
