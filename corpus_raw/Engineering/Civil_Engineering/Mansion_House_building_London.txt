Mansion House,  official residence of the lord mayor of the City of London. It stands in the City’s central financial district, across from the Bank of England and the Royal Exchange. Notable sections of the house include the dining room known as the Egyptian Hall, the second-story Ball Room, and the Court of Justice. Designed by George Dance the Elder, Mansion House was built in 1739–53 and greatly altered in the 1790s and in the mid-19th century. It was repaired following the aerial bombardments that plagued London in World War II, and a public gallery was added to the Court of Justice in 1962.
