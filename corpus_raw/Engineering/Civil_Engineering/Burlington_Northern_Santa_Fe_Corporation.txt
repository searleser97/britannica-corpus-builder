Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation,   American railway company formed in 1995 when Burlington Northern, Inc., acquired the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation. The latter railroad had historically operated under the name Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (q.v.).
Burlington Northern, Inc., arose out of the merger of the Great Northern Railway Company, the Northern Pacific Railway Company, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company (qq.v.) in 1970. In 1980 the Saint Louis–San Francisco Railway Company merged with Burlington Northern. This merger made Burlington Northern’s railway system the largest in the United States, extending from Chicago south to the Gulf of Mexico and west to the Pacific Northwest. Burlington Northern’s acquisition of the Santa Fe Railway gave it additional trackage in the south-central and southwestern United States. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas.
