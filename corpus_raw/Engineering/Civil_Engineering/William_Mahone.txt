William Mahone,  (born Dec. 1, 1826, Southampton County, Va., U.S.—died  Oct. 8, 1895, Washington, D.C.), American railroad magnate and general of the Confederacy who led Virginia’s “Readjuster” reform movement from 1879 to 1882.
Born the son of a tavernkeeper in an area of large plantations, Mahone graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1847 and then taught while studying engineering. He joined the Norfolk–Petersburg Railroad as an engineer in 1851, and 10 years later he was company president.
With the outbreak of the Civil War, Mahone was appointed quartermaster general of the Confederacy. But during most of the conflict, he served with the Army of Northern Virginia, eventually rising to the rank of major general. A decisive leader, much admired by his troops, Mahone was regarded as a true military hero among Southerners at the conclusion of the war.
He immediately returned to railroading at the cessation of hostilities, becoming president of the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (later the Norfolk & Western) in 1867. He built a strong political base through railroad patronage, but he lost his line when it went into receivership during the 1870s.
Unable to win the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1877—he had never had the support of Virginia’s “squirearchy” of  wealthy and powerful families—Mahone organized the Readjusters in 1879. This coalition of blacks and poor whites managed to take control of the state government and run it until 1882, reducing Virginia’s debt and enacting other reform measures.
In 1880 Mahone was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served as a Republican until 1887. He thereupon built a powerful political machine in Virginia, based on his total control of the state’s Republican Party. Thoroughly disliked by Southern conservatives, Mahone lost an election for governor in 1889, but he remained a potent political power in Virginia until his death.
