David Halliday Moffat,  (born July 22, 1839, Washingtonville, N.Y., U.S.â€”died  March 18, 1911, New York, N.Y.), American capitalist and railway promoter after whom the Moffat Tunnel in Colorado is named.
After a common-school education, Moffat worked in banks in New York City, in Des Moines, Iowa, and in Omaha, Neb. In 1860 he went to Denver, Colo., and became involved in mercantile enterprises, banks, mines, utilities, real estate, and a newspaper. His vision of Denver as a great transportation centre led him to invest in several railroads that were to provide routes to the Pacific Coast, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Colorado mining districts of Leadville and Cripple Creek. For his Denver, Northwestern and Pacific line (later the Denver and Salt Lake; incorporated into the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad), he planned a tunnel through the continental divide, but he died before he could raise the necessary money. The tunnel was built in the 1920s with public funds.
