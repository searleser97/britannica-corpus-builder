Sir Robert Dudley,  (born Aug. 7, 1574, Richmond, Surrey, Eng.—died Sept. 6, 1649, Florence), English sailor, engineer, and titular duke of Northumberland and earl of Warwick who wrote a well-known treatise, Dell’Arcano del mare (3 vol., 1646–47; “Concerning the Secret of the Sea”), that contained the sum of contemporary knowledge of navigation.
Proposing to explore Guiana, he voyaged to Trinidad and sent a boat some distance up the Orinoco River (1594). In 1596 he was knighted for his part in England’s naval operations against Spain. He later attempted to establish his legitimacy and claim to the titles of his father, Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester, basing his claims on an alleged marriage between his parents in 1573 (a marriage that his father had denied).
In 1605 he went to Italy, where he entered the service of the Grand Duke of Tuscany and was employed in draining the marshes between Pisa and Leghorn (1620) and in constructing the port of Leghorn. Published near the end of his life, his Arcano considered ship construction, a plan for building a navy of five classes of ships, and naval discipline; it also contained determinations of longitude, charts based on the map projections of Gerardus Mercator, and designs for instruments.
