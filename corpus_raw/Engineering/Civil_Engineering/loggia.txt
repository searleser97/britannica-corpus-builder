Loggia,   room, hall, gallery, or porch open to the air on one or more sides; it evolved in the Mediterranean region, where an open sitting room with protection from the sun was desirable. Ancient Egyptian houses often had a loggia on their roofs or an interior loggia facing upon a court.
In medieval and Renaissance Italy the loggia was often used in conjunction with a public square, as in the Loggia dei Lanzi (begun 1376) in Florence by Benci di Cione and Simone di Francesco. The loggia was also an essential feature of a villa and often had outstanding decorationâ€”e.g., the frescoes of Raphael in the Villa Farnesina loggia at Rome.
