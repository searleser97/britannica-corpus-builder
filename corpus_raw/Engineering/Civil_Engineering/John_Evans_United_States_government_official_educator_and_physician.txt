A graduate of Lynn Medical College, Cincinnati, Ohio (1838), Evans practiced medicine in Indiana, where he helped establish a state hospital for the insane and served as its first superintendent (Indianapolis, 1845–48). While serving as professor of obstetrics at Rush Medical College, Chicago (from 1848), he and Orrington Lunt founded Northwestern University (1851). He went to the Colorado Territory as its second governor in 1862. In 1864 he founded the Colorado Seminary (Methodist), which later became the University of Denver. The Denver Pacific, South Park, and Denver and New Orleans railways were organized and partly financed by Evans. The communities of Evanston, Ill., and Evanston, Wyo., as well as Mount Evans, Colo. (14,260 feet [4,350 m]), are named for him.
