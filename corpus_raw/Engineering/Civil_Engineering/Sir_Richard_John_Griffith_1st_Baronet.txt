Sir Richard John Griffith, 1st Baronet,  (born Sept. 20, 1784, Dublin—died  Sept. 22, 1878, Dublin), Irish geologist and civil engineer who has sometimes been called the “father of Irish geology.”
Griffith spent two years studying to be a civil engineer in London and then went to Cornwall to gain mining experience. He attended chemistry and natural history classes in Edinburgh for two years and was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh at age 23. In 1812 he became mining engineer to the Royal Dublin Society and government inspector of the mines in Ireland. One of his major accomplishments was the preparation, by 1835, of the first geological map of Ireland, which was followed by published large-scale maps in 1838 and 1839. Among his many other publications was a work on the Carboniferous limestone fossils of Ireland, in which he described many new species. His other endeavours included surveying coalfields and bogs in Ireland, supervising numerous public works, and serving as commissioner of valuation for land. He was created a baronet in 1858.
