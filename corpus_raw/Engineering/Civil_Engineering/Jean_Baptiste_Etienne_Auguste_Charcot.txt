Jean-Baptiste-Étienne-Auguste Charcot,  (born July 15, 1867, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Fr.—died c. Sept. 16, 1936, at sea off Iceland), French explorer and oceanographer who carried out extensive charting in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The son of the distinguished neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, the young Charcot himself studied medicine and worked at the Hospital of Paris from 1890 to 1894, when he was also connected with the Pasteur Institute. He served as chief of the clinic of the faculty of medicine at the University of Paris from 1896 to 1898. Within a few years he turned to exploration.
On his first Antarctic expedition (1903–05) he charted parts of the Palmer Archipelago, explored the Gerlache Strait, and sailed as far as the northern end of Adelaide Island. On his second expedition (1908–10) he charted the coast to Alexander Island and discovered Fallières Coast and the island that bears his name. Deception Island and Adelaide Island were charted in detail. In 1912 he published a two-volume report of his findings, Autour du pôle sud (“Around the South Pole”).
On subsequent ventures, between 1921 and 1936, with a corps of specialists, he studied plankton in the English Channel and in the North Atlantic and made oceanographic studies around the Hebrides, in Arctic waters, and off the east coast of Greenland. On Sept. 16, 1936, his ship was wrecked off Iceland. Only one man survived; Charcot and more than 30 others were drowned.
