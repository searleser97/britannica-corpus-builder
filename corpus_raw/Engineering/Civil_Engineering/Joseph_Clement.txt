Joseph Clement,  (baptized June 13, 1779, Great Asby, Westmorland [now Cumbria], England—died February 28, 1844, London), British engineer who has been called the “first computer engineer” for his work on inventor Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine.
Born into a weaver’s family, Clement learned metalworking skills and drawing and was soon building power looms in Aberdeen, where he designed his first tools. He moved to London in 1813, where he held high positions at two renowned engineering firms: that of Joseph Bramah, for whom he was chief draftsman and superintendent of his factory, and that of Henry Maudslay, also as chief draftsman. He opened his own business in 1817. His machine tools, including his planing machine and screw-cutting taps, were valued for their precision. He received a gold medal from the Royal Society of Arts in 1818 for his ellipsograph, a machine for drawing ellipses and circles.
In 1823 engineer Marc Isambard Brunel recommended Clement to Babbage as a draftsman and a builder in the project to build the Difference Engine, a calculating machine that is considered to be a mechanical forerunner of the modern computer. The tools that Clement made to machine parts for the engine were so expensive that Babbage was unable to pay for them. All design and construction ceased in 1833, when Clement refused to continue unless he was prepaid. The completed portion of the Difference Engine that Clement built is on permanent exhibit at the Science Museum in London.
