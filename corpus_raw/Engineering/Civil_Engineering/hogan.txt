Hogan,  traditional dwelling and ceremonial structure of the Navajo Indians of Arizona and New Mexico. Early hogans were dome-shaped buildings with log, or occasionally stone, frameworks. Once framed, the structure was then covered with mud, dirt, or sometimes sod. The entrance generally faced east, toward the rising sun, and was usually covered with a blanket. Except for a circular opening in the roof to allow smoke to escape, traditional hogans were without windows or interior divisions.
By the early 21st century, hogan architecture had changed somewhat to accommodate new construction materials and techniques. Typically hexagonal or octagonal buildings with notched-log or balloon-frame construction, they maintained traditional design elements such as the generally circular floor plan and eastward-facing door.
