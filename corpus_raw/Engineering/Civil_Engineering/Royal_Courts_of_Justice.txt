Royal Courts of Justice, also called Law Courts,  in London, complex of courtrooms, halls, and offices concerned primarily with civil (noncriminal) litigation. It lies in the Greater London borough of Westminster, on the boundary with the City of London.
Within its confines are held sessions of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice, and the Crown Court. Prior to the opening of the complex in 1882, civil cases were decided in Westminster Hall and in other locations. The Victorian Gothic structure was originally designed by George Edmund Street, who died during its construction. It includes several towers, more than 1,000 rooms, and ornate decorations and furnishings. Statues of Christ, King Solomon, King Alfred, and Moses are located above its main doors. Its main hall is about 240 feet (73 metres) long and 80 feet (24 metres) high. Extensions were added to the building in 1911 and 1968.
