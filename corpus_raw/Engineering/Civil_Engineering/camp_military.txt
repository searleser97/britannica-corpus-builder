Camp,   in military service, an area for temporary or semipermanent sheltering of troops. In most usage the word camp signifies an installation more elaborate and durable than a bivouac but less so than a fort or billet.
Historically, the camps of the Roman legions are especially noteworthy. However long or short the encampment, the Romans always built a rampart of ditches, earth walls, and wooden palisades, within which the space was divided into headquarters, supply, and troop areas in accordance with an unvarying plan; a surprise attack always found the troops in familiar surroundings and able to orient themselves quickly even in darkness. So secure were Roman camps that many of them formed the nuclei of future cities in France, England, and elsewhere. The development of firearms rendered the fortified camp largely obsolete; camps henceforth tended to be unprotected except for security pickets and patrols and were situated behind established fighting fronts.
