Gas burner,   heating device in which natural gas is used for fuel. Gas may be supplied to the burner prior to combustion at a pressure sufficient to induce a supply of air to mix with it; the mixture passes through several long narrow openings or a nozzle to mix with additional air in the combustion chamber. Metal surfaces supply the means of heat transfer to circulating water or air.
