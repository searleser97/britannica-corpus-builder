Later, with Jeremiah Head, he produced a steam-hauled plow, which in winning the £500 prize (1858) offered by the Royal Society fulfilled the society’s dictum for a “steam cultivator” that would be an “economic substitute for the plough or the spade.” He died of tetanus following an injury received after being thrown by a horse.
