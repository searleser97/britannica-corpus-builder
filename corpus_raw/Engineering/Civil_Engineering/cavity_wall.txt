Cavity wall,  in architecture, a double wall consisting of two wythes (vertical layers) of masonry separated by an air space and joined together by metal ties. Cavity walls have a heat-flow rate that is 50 percent that of a solid wall. As a result, they are often used in colder climates. The cavity also allows moisture that penetrates the exterior wythe to drain. Cavity walling is used as both non-load-bearing infill for framed buildings and for bearing-wall construction.
