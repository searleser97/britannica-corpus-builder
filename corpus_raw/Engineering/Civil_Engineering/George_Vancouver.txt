George Vancouver,  (born June 22, 1757, King’s Lynn, Norfolk, England—died May 10, 1798, Richmond, Surrey), English navigator who, with great precision, completed one of the most difficult surveys ever undertaken, that of the Pacific coast of North America, from the vicinity of San Francisco northward to present-day British Columbia. At that time he verified that no continuous channel exists between the Pacific Ocean and Hudson Bay, in northeast Canada.
Vancouver entered the Royal Navy at age 13 and accompanied Captain James Cook on his second and third voyages (1772–75 and 1776–80). After nine years’ service in the West Indies, he took command of the expedition to the northwest coast of North America for which he is noted. Departing from England on April 1, 1791, he went by way of the Cape of Good Hope to Australia, where he surveyed part of the southwest coast. After stops at Tahiti and the Hawaiian Islands, Vancouver sighted the west coast of North America at 39°27′ N on April 17, 1792. He examined the coast with minute care, surveying the intricate inlets and channels in the region of Vancouver Island and naming, among others, Puget Sound and the Gulf of Georgia. By August he was negotiating with the Spaniards to take control of their former coastal station at Nootka Sound, off Vancouver Island. Continuing his coastal exploration in April 1793, he surveyed north to 56°44′ N and south to below San Luis Obispo, California. In 1794 he sailed to Cook Inlet, off southern Alaska, and, after a fresh survey of much of the coast north of San Francisco, sailed homeward via Cape Horn, reaching England on October 20, 1795. His Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean and Round the World…1790–95, three volumes with an atlas of maps and plates, was published after his death in 1798.
