Shoin,   in Japanese domestic architecture, desk alcove that projects onto the veranda and has above it a shoji window made of latticework wood covered with a tough, translucent white paper. The shoin is one of the formative elements of, and lends its name to, the shoin style of Japanese domestic architecture. It seems to have been a Chinese feature adapted to Japanese Buddhist (particularly Zen Buddhist) dwellings. The shoin bay was a popular feature of priests’ houses by the late Kamakura period (1192–1333). It became part of the mainstream of secular architecture as a status symbol, giving a scholarly air to the main guest room.
