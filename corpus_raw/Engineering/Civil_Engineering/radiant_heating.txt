Radiant heating,  heating system in which heat is transmitted by radiation from a heated surface. Radiant heating systems usually employ either electric-resistance wiring or hot-water heating pipes, which may be embedded in the floor, ceiling, or walls. Panel heating is a form of radiant heating characterized by very large surfaces (typically an entire ceiling or floor) containing electrical conductors, hot-water pipes, or hot-air ducts. With many such systems there is no visible heating equipment in the room.
