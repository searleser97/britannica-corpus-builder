George Dance, the Younger,  (born 1741, London, Eng.—died  Jan. 14, 1825, London), British architect who was responsible for extensive urban redevelopment in London. He was a founding member of Great Britain’s Royal Academy of Arts.
The youngest son of George Dance the Elder, who was clerk of works to the City of London from 1735 to 1768, the younger Dance received his formal training in the office of his father and during several years spent in Italy. He succeeded his father as supervisor of all planning and building within the City of London upon his father’s death in 1768. Soon afterward he designed his best-known structure, Newgate Prison (1770–78; demolished 1902), which was notable for the strength and severity of its rusticated (rough-hewn) masonry.
In his earliest works Dance created graceful versions of the Neoclassical style then popular in England. An example is the church of All Hallows, London Wall (1765–67), one of the few surviving Dance structures. It has an unconventional Neoclassical interior that typifies Dance’s original approach to architectural design. He followed the example of the Woods in the city of Bath in introducing the use of the circus (a circular area at an intersection of streets) and the crescent (a semicircular row of houses) into London street planning. Many of his proposals were never carried out, but he did complete America Square, Minories (1768–74), Finsbury Square (1777–91), and Finsbury Circus (designed 1802; built by William Montague, 1815–17). He also remodeled sections of Guildhall (the administrative headquarters of the City of London) and designed the Port of London’s West India Docks (from 1796).
