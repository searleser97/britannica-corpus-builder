Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet,  (born Aug. 7, 1779, Montélimar, Fr.—died  Aug. 18, 1842, near Loriol, Fr.), French naval officer and cartographer who explored portions of Australia and islands in the Pacific Ocean.
In 1800 he joined Captain Nicolas Baudin on a voyage of exploration to southern and southwestern coastal Australia and Tasmania. After his return to Paris in 1804, he completed an account of this expedition, Voyage de découvertes aux terres australes (1807; “Voyage of Discovery to Southern Lands”), for which he also drew maps.
In 1817 he took command of l’Uranie to conduct magnetic and oceanographic researches in the Pacific. His wife, Rose, disguised as a sailor, was smuggled aboard and accompanied the voyage, which she described in a journal published in 1827. After a stop at Rio de Janeiro, l’Uranie rounded the Cape of Good Hope and visited Timor, north of Australia, and the Mariana and Hawaiian islands. Freycinet named Rose Island in the Samoa group for his wife.
On the return voyage from Sydney to France, via Cape Horn, l’Uranie was wrecked in the Falkland Islands, but the scientific data and specimens aboard were saved. Freycinet purchased an American whaler, renamed la Physicienne, and in it returned to France. Observations from the expedition were published in Voyage autour du monde . . . sur les corvettes de S.M. “l’Uranie” et “la Physicienne,” 13 vol. and four atlases (1824–44; “Voyage Around the World . . . in H.M. Corvettes l’Uranie and la Physicienne”).
