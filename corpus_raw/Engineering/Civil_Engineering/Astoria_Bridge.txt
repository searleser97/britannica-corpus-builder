Astoria Bridge, also called Astoria-Megler Bridge or Columbia River (Astoria) Bridge,  truss bridge spanning the mouth of the Columbia River between the states of Oregon and Washington, western United States. It was designed by William A. Bugee and at its completion in 1966, it was the longest continuous-truss bridge in the world. The bridge, stretching from Astoria, Oregon, to Point Ellice (near Megler), Washington, provided the final link in the U.S. highway system between Mexico and Canada when it opened to traffic.
A two-lane highway steel bridge 28 feet (8.5 metres) wide, it consists of three spans reaching a total length of 21,474 feet (6,545 metres) and including a main span of 1,232 feet (376 metres). The bridge was built to withstand Pacific storms with wind speeds that reach some 150 miles (240 km) per hour and river currents that can hit speeds of 9 miles (14 km) per hour.
The Astoria Bridge was meant to replace ferry service that was inefficient and subject to disruptions during bad weather. But there was much debate over its construction because of its remote location, and critics called it a “bridge to nowhere.” They were proved wrong: soon after the bridge was dedicated on August 27, 1966, the volume of traffic it carried far exceeded expectations.
The bridge is the site of the Great Columbia Crossing, held each October, during which pedestrians are allowed to cross the bridge. Associated with the event, the town of Astoria hosts the Silver Salmon Celebration festival, which includes a barbecue and entertainment. In addition, the bridge has been featured in several car and truck television commercials, as well as in the 1986 movie Short Circuit.
