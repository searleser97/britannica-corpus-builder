Cenotaph,   (from Greek kenotaphion, “empty tomb”), monument, sometimes in the form of a tomb, to a person who is buried elsewhere. Greek writings indicate that the ancients erected many cenotaphs, including one raised by the Athenians to the poet Euripides, though none of these survive. Such existing memorials are distributed mainly in major churches—e.g., in Santa Croce, Florence, where there are memorials to Dante, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Galileo, and in Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s Cathedral, London. The term is now almost wholly applied, however, to national war memorials, notably the London Cenotaph, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and completed in 1920.
