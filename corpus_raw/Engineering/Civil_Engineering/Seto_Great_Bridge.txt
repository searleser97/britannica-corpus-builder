Seto Great Bridge, Japanese Seto Ōhashi,  a series of suspension bridges spanning the Inland Sea (Seto-naikai) between the islands of Honshu and Shikoku, Japan. The double-tiered rail and vehicular roadway is a network of six bridges, straddling a chain of five small islands, and extends 9 km (5.6 miles) over water to link the towns of Kojima, on Honshu, and Sakaide, on Shikoku. Its total length is 12.2 km (7.6 miles), and it consists of three main suspensions—the longest being the central span of Minami Bisan–Seto Bridge, at 1,118 metres (3,667 feet). The Seto Great Bridge took 10 years to build and was opened on April 10, 1988.
