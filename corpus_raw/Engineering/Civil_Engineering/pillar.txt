Pillar,   in architecture and building construction, any isolated, vertical structural member such as a pier, column, or post. It may be constructed of a single piece of stone or wood or built up of units, such as bricks. It may be any shape in cross section. A pillar commonly has a load-bearing or stabilizing function, but it may also stand alone, as do commemorative pillars. See also column.
