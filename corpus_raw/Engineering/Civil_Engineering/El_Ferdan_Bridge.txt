El-Ferdan Bridge, also called El-Ferdan Swing Bridge or Al-Firdan Railway Bridge,  longest rotating metal bridge in the world, spanning the western shipping lane of the Suez Canal in northeastern Egypt, from the lower Nile River valley near Ismailia to the Sinai Peninsula. Opened on November 14, 2001, the bridge has a single railway track running down the middle that is flanked by two 10-foot- (3-metre-) wide lanes for high-speed vehicular traffic. Also called a swing, or double-cantilever, bridge, the structure is 2,099 feet (640 metres) long and has a steel truss superstructure 41 feet (12.6 metres) wide and 197 feet (60 metres) high at the pivot. Each giant steel arm swings open 90°, creating a navigational space 1,050 feet (320 metres) wide. This process takes about 15 minutes.
El-Ferdan Bridge was designed and constructed by a consortium of German, Belgian, and Egyptian companies. The fifth bridge to be built across the Suez Canal, it replaced another railway bridge destroyed during the Arab-Israeli conflict (Six-Day War) in 1967. The project was completed in less than five years and was an important component of Egypt’s National Scheme for Sinai Development; it reconnected the peninsula’s only railway line, which runs some 225 miles (360 km) from Ismailia to Rafah. The bridge was meant to be a catalyst for agricultural and industrial development in the region, but it was also geopolitically significant because it made it possible to cross between Africa and Asia in just a few minutes.
