Bridge of Sighs, Italian Ponte dei Sospiri,  enclosed limestone bridge in Venice, Italy, spanning the narrow canal (Rio di Palazzo) between the Doge’s Palace and the prisons. Commissioned by the doge Marino Grimani, whose familial coat of arms is depicted in the centre of the facade, the Baroque-style bridge was built about 1600 by the architect Antonio Contino. The enclosed passageway was named for the “sighs” of the prisoners who passed over it. Tradition holds that if a couple kisses while passing underneath the bridge in a gondola, they will enjoy eternal love.
