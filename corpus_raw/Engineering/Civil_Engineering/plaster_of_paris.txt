Plaster of paris,  quick-setting gypsum plaster consisting of a fine white powder (calcium sulfate hemihydrate), which hardens when moistened and allowed to dry. Known since ancient times, plaster of paris is so called because of its preparation from the abundant gypsum found near Paris.
Plaster of paris does not generally shrink or crack when dry, making it an excellent medium for casting molds. It is commonly used to precast and hold parts of ornamental plasterwork placed on ceilings and cornices. It is also used in medicine to make plaster casts to immobilize broken bones while they heal, though many modern orthopedic casts are made of fibreglass or thermoplastics. Some sculptors work directly in plaster of paris, as the speed at which the plaster sets gives the work a sense of immediacy and enables the sculptor to achieve the original idea quickly. In medieval and Renaissance times, gesso (usually made of plaster of paris mixed with glue) was applied to wood panels, plaster, stone, or canvas to provide the ground for tempera and oil painting.
Plaster of paris is prepared by heating calcium sulfate dihydrate, or gypsum, to 120–180 °C (248–356 °F). With an additive to retard the set, it is called wall, or hard wall, plaster, which can provide passive fire protection for interior surfaces.
