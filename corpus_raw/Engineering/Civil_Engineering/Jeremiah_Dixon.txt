Jeremiah Dixon,  (died 1777, Durham, Durham, Eng.), British surveyor who, working with fellow surveyor Charles Mason, established the boundary between Maryland and Pennsylvania, known since as the Mason and Dixon Line.
Almost nothing is known of Dixon’s life prior to his association with Mason. In 1760 the two were selected by the Royal Astronomical Society to travel to Sumatra in order to observe the transit of Venus. They got no further than the Cape of Good Hope, however (where they did make some observations), before returning to England.
In 1763 Mason and Dixon were commissioned by the heirs of William Penn and Lord Baltimore to settle an old dispute over the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland. Arriving in Philadelphia in November, they began work the following month at the northeastern corner of Maryland. Proceeding along the parallel of latitude 39°43′17.6″ N, they set milestones bearing a P on one side and M on the other along 244 miles of the boundary; every fifth milestone bore the Penn arms and Calvert arms on appropriate sides. Hostile Indians prevented Mason and Dixon from marking the final 36 miles, and in 1767 they returned to Philadelphia. Their work cost $75,000, but it was ratified by the crown in 1769 and has been accepted ever since.
The Mason and Dixon Line has always been popularly regarded as the boundary between the North and the South, though it was limited to the two states of Pennsylvania and Maryland.
Mason and Dixon were discharged as surveyors of the colonial boundary on Dec. 26, 1767, but they did not return to England until Sept. 9, 1768. Mason continued to work for the Royal Society, but nothing more is known of Dixon other than the year and place of his death.
