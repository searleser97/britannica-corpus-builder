Trump Tower,  mixed-use skyscraper in Manhattan, New York, located on Fifth Avenue at East 56th Street. It opened in 1983, although work was not completed until the following year. Trump Tower is 664 feet (202 metres) high and has 58 stories. It was the principal residence of its developer and namesake, Donald Trump, at the time of his election as U.S. president in 2016. It may be noted that Trump Tower is not the only New York City skyscraper to have carried the Trump name and that the names Trump Tower or Trump Towers have been affixed to buildings in other cities.
Trump Tower is of reinforced concrete construction and has a dark glass curtain wall. The building has a jagged façade with 28 sides, maximizing the number of corner rooms. It was designed by Der Scutt of the New York firm of Swanke Hayden Connell Architects and was built between 1980 and 1984. The site had been occupied previously by the Bonwit Teller department store, a building with an artistic façade that was destroyed in the course of demolition, provoking some outcry.
On Trump Tower’s lowest aboveground floors is an atrium featuring an artificial waterfall, a Trump-branded food court, and a shop where Trump-branded merchandise is sold. Above the atrium is office space and then 39 floors of condominium apartments. The highest floor is marked 68, but floor designations do not correspond to the actual number of stories.
Trump’s own apartment occupies the three highest floors and is accessed from a private elevator. The tower also houses the offices of Trump’s real estate company, the Trump Organization. It was a location for his reality television program, The Apprentice, and the headquarters for his presidential campaign. After his election, restrictions were imposed on vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the vicinity of the building.
