Rubble masonry, also called rubblework,  the use of undressed, rough stone, generally in the construction of walls. Dry-stone random rubble walls, for which rough stones are piled up without mortar, are the most basic form. An intermediate method is coursed rubble walling, for which stones are roughly dressed and laid in courses. Snecked rubble features stones of varying sizes with small fillers or snecks between them.
The primary reason for the use of rubble in masonry is the relative difficulty of dressing most types of stone. Rubblework was preferred where the surface either would be faced with ashlar (dressed stone), or otherwise hidden, as in a foundation, or where the builder wanted or was indifferent to the rough effect.
Rubblework bound with mortar was often used as an infilling between dressed wall faces. Used in this way it does not contribute significantly to the wallâ€™s strength and may even detract from it if the mortar is poorly prepared, leached out by moisture, or otherwise unsuitable. Nevertheless, many medieval cathedrals were built in this manner. Rubblework in walls was superseded even in ancient times by brick when available and in modern construction by reinforced concrete.
