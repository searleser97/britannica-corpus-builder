Cascade Tunnel,   one of the longest railroad tunnels in the United States, located in central Washington about 60 miles (100 km) east of Seattle. It carries a line of the Burlington Northern Sante Fe railroad through the Cascade Range between Berne (on the east) and Scenic. It is 41,078 feet (7.8 miles [12.5 km]) long. Constructed from 1925 to 1929, it replaced a shorter tunnel a few miles to the north.
