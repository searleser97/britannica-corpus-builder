George William Evans,  (born January 5, 1780, London, England—died October 16, 1852, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia), English surveyor and explorer notable for his discoveries in the interior of New South Wales, Australia.
As an apprentice to an engineer and architect, Evans learned surveying. In 1796 he emigrated to the Cape of Good Hope, and, after British forces withdrew from there in 1802, he went to New South Wales as a storekeeper. In 1802–03 he was appointed acting surveyor-general of that colony.
In 1804 Evans discovered and explored the Warragamba River. Discharged in 1805 by Governor Phillip King, Evans farmed land granted him earlier but failed and in 1809 was appointed assistant surveyor at Port Dalrymple. In 1812 he explored overland to Jervis Bay, where he surveyed its shores; as a result the Illawara region was settled. In 1812 he explored the interior of New South Wales and was appointed deputy surveyor of lands in Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania). In the course of his seven-week 1813 expedition to the interior of New South Wales, he became the first European to make a complete crossing of the Great Dividing Range. In 1815 he explored further, discovering the Lachlan River, which he followed as far as Mandagery Creek.
In 1817 he was second-in-command to the surveyor-general John Oxley in an expedition to trace the Lachlan River and in 1818 in an attempt to trace the Macquarie River to its source. He resumed his deputy surveyorship but went with the first party sent to Macquarie Harbour in 1822. He was implicated in charges of corruption against the deputy governor William Sorell and in 1825 resigned his office, took his pension, and returned to London, where he taught art. As an artist, Evans painted scenes set both in settlements and in the bush. In 1832, after surrendering his pension, he returned to Australia, settling in Sydney, where he opened a bookshop and later became a drawing master at a school in Parramatta. He moved to Hobart, Tasmania, in 1844 and remained there until his death.
