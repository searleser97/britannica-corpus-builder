Diocletian window, also called thermal window,  semicircular window or opening divided into three compartments by two vertical mullions. Diocletian windows were named for those windows found in the Thermae, or Baths, of Diocletian (now the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli) in Rome. The variant name, thermal window, also comes from association with the Thermae. This type of window was used in the 16th century, especially by Andrea Palladio, and in the early 18th century by the English architect Richard Boyle, 3rd earl of Burlington, one of the originators of the English Palladian style, and his followers.
