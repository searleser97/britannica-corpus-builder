Balloon framing,   framework of a wooden building in which the elements consist of small members nailed together. In balloon framing, the studs (vertical members) extend the full height of the building (usually two stories) from foundation plate to rafter plate, as contrasted with platform framing, in which each floor is framed separately.
Balloon framing is used primarily in Scandinavia and in the United States. Queen Anne and Shingle-style buildings are typical examples of balloon framing.
