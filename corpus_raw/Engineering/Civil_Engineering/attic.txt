Attic,   in architecture, story immediately under the roof of a structure and wholly or partly within the roof framing. Originally, the word denoted any portion of a wall above the main cornice. Utilized by the ancient Romans principally for decorative purposes and inscriptions, as in triumphal arches, it became an important part of the Renaissance facade, often enclosing an additional story, the windows of which became part of the decoration.
