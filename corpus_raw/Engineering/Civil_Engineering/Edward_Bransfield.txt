Edward Bransfield,  (born c. 1785, Ballinacurra, Ireland—died 1852, Brighton, England), Irish-born English naval officer believed to have been the first to sight the Antarctic mainland and to chart a portion of it.
Master aboard HMS Andromache at Valparaíso, Chile, he was appointed to sail the two-masted brig Williams in order to chart the recently sighted South Shetland Islands, which lie near the Antarctic Peninsula. Under Bransfield’s command, the Williams arrived at the South Shetlands in January 1820, landed on King George Island to take formal possession, and coasted past Deception Island. Turning southward into what is now called the Bransfield Strait, he sighted and charted “high mountains, covered with snow,” now Mounts Bransfield and Jacquinot on the Antarctic mainland (January 30, 1820). The charts survive in the hydrographic department of the British Admiralty at Taunton, Somerset, England.
