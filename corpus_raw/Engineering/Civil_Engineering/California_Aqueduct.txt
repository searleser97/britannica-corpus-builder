California Aqueduct, in full Governor Edmund G. Brown California Aqueduct,  principal water-conveyance structure of the California State Water Project, U.S., and one of the largest aqueduct systems in the world. The California State Water Project, begun in 1960, is designed to transport water to arid southern California from sources in the wetter northern portion of the state. The California Aqueduct conveys water about 1,135 km (705 miles) across the state, yielding more than 2.5 billion litres (650 million gallons) of water a day. It serves some 27 million people and 750,000 acres of farmland.
From the Sacramento River delta east of San Francisco, the California Aqueduct runs south through the San Joaquin Valley and over the summit of the Tehachapi Mountains, a distance of 440 km (273 miles). At the Tehachapi Mountains, water is lifted 587 metres (1,926 feet) at the Edmonston Pumping Plant, the highest single-lift pumping plant in the world. At this point the aqueduct divides into east, coastal, and west branches, the former terminating some 715 km (444 miles) from the delta. The aqueduct comprises more than 20 pumping stations, five hydroelectric plants, and more than 100 dams and flow-control structures. Channel sizes vary along the aqueduct, a typical section being a concrete-lined canal 12 metres (40 feet) wide at the base, with 9 metres (30 feet) the average depth of flow.
