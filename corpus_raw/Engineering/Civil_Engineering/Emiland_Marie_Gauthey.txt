Emiland-Marie Gauthey,  (born December 3, 1732, Châlon-sur-Saône, France—died  July 14, 1806, Paris), French engineer, best known for his construction of the Charolais Canal, or Canal du Centre, which united the Loire and Saône rivers in France, thus providing a water route from the Loire to the Rhône River.
Gauthey studied at the École des Ponts et Chaussées (School of Bridges and Highways) in Paris, then taught there while making important pioneering contributions to the study of building materials. About 1767 he drew up plans for a canal linking the Loire and the Rhône. Work began under his direction in 1783, and the project was completed nine years later. The work involved construction of locks and several bridges. He also directed the building of a church at Givry between 1773 and 1791 and restored the castle of Chagny (both in Saône-et-Loire département) in 1780.
