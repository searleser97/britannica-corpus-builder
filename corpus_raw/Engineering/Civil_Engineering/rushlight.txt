Rushlight,  stem of a rush, stripped of most of its tough outer fibre to expose the pith, which is then dipped in melted fat and used as a taper for illumination. The rushlight is dipped only once or a few times and remains too thin and soft to stand in a candlestick (many dippings produce a candle). The rushlight was burned in a small pierced metal container or in a special holder consisting of pincers on a stand. Rush wicks were used in lamps in ancient Rome, and rushlights may be older than true candles. A rushlight gave about as much light as a candle and was less expensive, but it dropped melted grease. As late as 1880 rushlights were still used in England.
