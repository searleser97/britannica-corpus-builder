keep,  English term corresponding to the French donjon for the strongest portion of the fortification of a castle, the place of last resort in case of siege or attack.
The keep was either a single tower or a larger fortified enclosure. Approximately round keeps, such as those in Berkeley Castle or Windsor, were known as shell keeps, while Norman keeps tended to be massive square towers. The most famous of the Norman keeps of England is the White Tower of London of the 11th century, supposedly designed by Gundulf, bishop of Rochester. Other Norman keeps include those at Rochester, Arundel, and Newcastle.
