James J. Hill, in full James Jerome Hill,  (born September 16, 1838, near Guelph, Ontario, Canada—died May 29, 1916, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.), American financier and railroad builder who helped expand rail networks in the northwestern United States.
After settling in St. Paul, Minnesota, about 1870, he established transportation lines on the Mississippi and Red rivers and arranged a traffic interchange with the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. On that line’s failure in 1873, Hill interested Canadian capitalists and reorganized it as the St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Manitoba Railway Company, becoming its president in 1882.
After the Great Northern Railway absorbed the St. Paul line in 1890, Hill became its president (1893–1907) and chairman of its board of directors (1907–12). The Northern Pacific and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy railroads also came under Hill’s control.
He was active in banking as president of the Northern Securities Company (which in 1904 was declared in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act). In 1912 he took control of the First and Second National Banks of St. Paul and effected a merger. His Highways of Progress was published in 1910.
