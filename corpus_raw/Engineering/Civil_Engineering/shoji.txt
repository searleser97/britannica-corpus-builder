Shoji, Japanese Shōji,   in Japanese architecture, sliding outer partition doors and windows made of a latticework wooden frame and covered with a tough, translucent white paper. When closed, they softly diffuse light throughout the house.
In summer they are often removed completely, opening the house to the outside—a desirable arrangement in Japan because of the extreme humidity. The shoji is a feature of the shoin style, which first appeared in the Kamakura period (1192–1333).
