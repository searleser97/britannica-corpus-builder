William Sellers,  (born Sept. 19, 1824, Upper Darby, Pa., U.S.—died Jan. 24, 1905, Philadelphia, Pa.), American engineer and manufacturer.
Sellers was born into a distinguished scientific family. The first of his firms manufactured machinists’ tools and mill gearing. His formulas for matching screw threads and nuts (1864) became the U.S. standards. In 1868 he founded Edge Moor Iron Co., which became the largest plant in the world for supplying and building iron bridges (it provided all the structural work for the Brooklyn Bridge) and other large structures. He was president from 1873 of Midvale Steel Co. (Nicetown, Pa.), which became the major metal supplier for U.S. government ordnance and small arms.
