Rogun Dam,  partially finished large clay-core rock-fill dam, expected to be the world’s highest and tallest dam, being built on the Vakhsh River in southern Tajikistan, upstream from the Nurek Dam. It was first proposed in 1959, and construction began in 1976, when Tajikistan was part of the Soviet Union. Following Tajikistan’s independence in 1991, work on the dam slowed for lack of funds, and in 1993 floodwaters destroyed much of the rock fill and other work that had already been completed. Construction of the dam resumed in 2016 after the project was contracted to the Italian company Salini Impregilo, and the first operational unit of the dam was inaugurated on November 16, 2018.
The Rogun Dam is set to be the highest and tallest dam in the world when completed. It is designed to rise to a height of 1,099 feet (335 metres) above the canyon floor and to have a crest length of 2,165 feet (660 metres). Its design also includes the building of six hydroelectric generating units with a power capacity totaling 3,600 megawatts. Construction is expected to be completed in 2028.
