Deutsche Bahn AG, English German Railway,  the railway system of Germany created in 1994 by the merger of the Deutsche Bundesbahn (German Federal Railway), the state rail system in the former West Germany, with the Deutsche Reichsbahn (German State Railway), the state system in the former East Germany. At the time of German reunification, the system route length totaled about 25,800 miles (41,500 km), of which two-thirds was in western Germany; about one-third of the track was electrified.
The first rail line in Germany was opened between Nürnberg and Fürth in 1835, and within a century the country had some 35,000 miles (56,000 km) of track. After 1870 the German states began transferring the privately owned railroads to public ownership. By 1920 the entire network was operated by one national rail corporation, the Reichsbahn. The division of Germany after World War II left the two successor states with a network that was severely damaged in the war and largely had to be rebuilt and reequipped. In addition, much of the former east-west orientation was interrupted, and, especially in the west, the lines had to be realigned north-south. Since 1990, work has been underway to reestablish east-west links. The system also was converted to a quasi-state corporation in 1994.
