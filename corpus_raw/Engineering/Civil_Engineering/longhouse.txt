Longhouse,  traditional dwelling of many Northeast Indians of North America. A traditional longhouse was built by using a rectangular frame of saplings, each 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) in diameter. The larger end of each sapling was placed in a posthole in the ground, and a domed roof was created by tying together the sapling tops. The structure was then covered with bark panels or shingles. In some cases separate doors were provided for men and women, one at each end of the house.
Archaeological excavations of many longhouses in New York state testify to their design and structure. They ranged from 40 to 400 feet (12 to 122 metres) in length and were generally about 22 to 23 feet (6 to 7 metres) wide. Interior partitions were built at right angles to the long sides of the building at about 7-foot (2-metre) intervals, subdividing the interior into compartments that were connected by a long open centre aisle extending from one end of the house to the other. It is supposed that each nuclear family had one or more compartments for its use, but, as there was no wall shutting off each stall from the central aisle, there was little privacy. For cooking and heating, four compartments—two on each side—shared a central fire built in the aisle; an opening in the roof served as a chimney.
Residential life in the longhouse is no longer common, but some traditions related to the buildings persist; some contemporary groups continue to refer to their large meeting venues as longhouses. These structures are generally built with clapboard sides, and their interiors have no stalls. Separate doorways for males and females are still provided in some cases.
