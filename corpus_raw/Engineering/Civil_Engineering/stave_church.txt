Stave church,  in architecture, type of wooden church built in northern Europe mainly during the Middle Ages. Between 800 and 1,200 stave churches may have existed in the mid-14th century, at which time construction abruptly ceased.
About 30 stave churches survive in Norway, nearly all dating from the 12th and 13th centuries; Sweden, Poland, and England each have one of these churches. In the typical Scandinavian type of stave church, a foundation of boulders supports a horizontal wooden frame on which rest four corner posts, or staves. The staves are connected above by a rectangle of beams that complete a boxlike frame; all elements are joined by wooden pegs or by dovetailing. The outer wall timbers of stave churches are positioned vertically, in contrast to the more common “log” horizontal placement used in wooden structures. The simplest stave churches consist only of a nave and chancel. The plans of larger churches are sometimes cruciform (cross-shaped), and they may include an ambulatory as well as an apse. The best-known stave churches are characterized by a roof with multiple tiers of triangular frames that gradually diminish in size. Many also have portals embellished with fine woodcarving and wall paintings that feature pagan and Christian motifs.
The largest extant stave church was built in Heddal, Norway, about 1150. Another typical and well-preserved example of the stave church is the Borgund church (c. 1150) in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. Its complicated, ambulatory plan utilizes freestanding posts in the nave to support the tall central portion of the structure. The church’s six levels of gable roofs, shell-like exterior shingles, and elaborate carvings of grotesque masks and other motifs give it a picturesque and vigorous appearance. Some extant stave churches continue to be used as active houses of worship.
