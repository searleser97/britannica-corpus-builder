Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval,  (born May 9, 1845, Blasenborg, Swed.â€”died  Feb. 2, 1913, Stockholm), Swedish scientist, engineer, and inventor who pioneered in the development of high-speed turbines.
After 1872 he was an engineer with the Klosters-Bruck Steel Works. In 1878 he invented the centrifugal cream separator, and later he applied the principle of rotation to the manufacture of glass bottles.
Laval built his first impulse steam turbine in 1882. Further advances followed, and in 1893 he built and operated a reversible turbine for marine use. A Laval reaction turbine (patented in 1883) attained a speed of 42,000 revolutions per minute. He continued improving his turbine until by 1896 he was operating a complete power plant using an initial steam pressure of 3,400 pounds per square inch. He invented and developed the divergent nozzle used to deliver steam to the turbine blades. His flexible shaft, used to eliminate wobbling, which can be dangerous at high speeds, and his special double-helical gear formed the foundation for most steam-turbine development that followed.
