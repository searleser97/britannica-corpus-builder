Eduard Rüppell, in full Wilhelm Peter Eduard Simon Rüppell,  (born November 20, 1794, Frankfurt am Main [Germany]—died December 10, 1884, Frankfurt am Main), German naturalist and explorer of northeastern Africa who is remembered as much for the zoological and ethnographical collections he brought back to Europe as for his explorations.
Rüppell first went to Africa in 1817 and ascended the Nile River to its first set of cataracts (at Aswān, Egypt). Returning to Germany he completed his scientific training and then began his first expedition (1822–28), crossing the Sudan from the Nubian Desert south to Kordofan in the central Sudan. On his second (1831–34), he crossed Ethiopia from east to west, by way of the ruins of Aksum, to Lake Tana, which he mapped more accurately than his predecessors. His reports of the antiquities of Aksum added enormously to knowledge of the subject and included the first drawings of Aksumite coinage. On his return he stayed at the then capital of Ethiopia, Gonder, where he put his collections in order and amassed an anthology of ancient Ethiopian manuscripts.
