Firebrick, also called Refractory Brick,  refractory material consisting of nonmetallic minerals formed in a variety of shapes for use at high temperatures, particularly in structures for metallurgical operations and glass manufacturing. Principal raw materials for firebrick include fireclays, mainly hydrated aluminum silicates; minerals of high aluminum oxide content, such as bauxite, diaspore, and kyanite; sources of silica, including sand and quartzite; magnesia minerals, magnesite, dolomite, forsterite, and olivine; chromite, a solid solution of chromic oxide with the oxides of aluminum, iron, and magnesium; carbon as graphite or coke; and vermiculite mica. Minor raw materials are zirconia, zircon, thoria, beryllia, titania, and ceria, and other minerals containing rare-earth elements.
Firebricks are formed by the dry-press, stiff-mud, soft-mud casting, and hot-pressing processes used in the manufacture of building bricks. Some materials, including magnesite and dolomite, require firing in rotary kilns to bring about sintering and densification before the crushed and sized material can be fabricated into refractory shapes and refired. Raw materials are fused in an electric furnace followed by casting of the melt in special molds. 
In glass production, highly siliceous, dense, fireclay bricks, known as flux blocks, are preferred in the portion of the tank that comes in contact with molten glass. Mullite firebricks, prepared from the mineral kyanite, have excellent durability, as do also fused alumina bricks; neither of these allows penetration of the glass and is comparatively inert chemically. Zirconia bricks also have no porosity and great resistance to attack by molten glass.
