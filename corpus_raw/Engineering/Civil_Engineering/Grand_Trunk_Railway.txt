Grand Trunk Railway,  early Canadian railway line, incorporated in 1852–53 to build a railway connecting the key cities of the Province of Canada (the area now known as Ontario and Quebec) with the American seacoast city of Portland, Maine. By completing its final link in July 1853 between Montreal and Portland, the Grand Trunk became North America’s first international railroad. The main line within Canada, from Montreal to Toronto, opened in October 1856. The Grand Trunk Railway eventually became the main railway system of Quebec and Ontario.
During the period from 1867 to 1905 the Grand Trunk concentrated on taking over smaller, competing lines and on building rail connections to the rail system of the northern United States. The Grand Trunk was also in competition with the Great Western Railway until the two merged in 1882. Eventually, a western branch, the Grand Trunk Pacific, was constructed, but this new rail network proved so unprofitable that it passed into government receivership in 1919. As a result of the liabilities incurred by its Pacific subsidiary, the Grand Trunk Railway was nationalized and became part of the Canadian National Railways in 1923.
