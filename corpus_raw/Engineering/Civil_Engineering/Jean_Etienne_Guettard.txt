Jean-Étienne Guettard,  (born Sept. 22, 1715, Étampes, Fr.—died  Jan. 6, 1786, Paris), French geologist and mineralogist who was the first to survey and map the geologic features of France and to study the exposed bedrock of the Paris Basin. He was also the first to recognize the volcanic nature of the Auvergne region of central France.
The keeper of the Duc d’Orléans’s natural history collection, Guettard was the first to identify several fossil species from the Paris area and to suspect the volcanic origin of mountains in central France. He wrote Mémoire et carte minéralogique sur la nature et la situation des terrains qui traversent la France et l’Angleterre (1746; “Mineralogical Memoir and Map on the Nature and Location of the Terrains That Traverse France and England”) and Atlas et description minéralogiques de la France (1780).
