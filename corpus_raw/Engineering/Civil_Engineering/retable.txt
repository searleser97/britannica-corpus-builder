Retable,  ornamental panel behind an altar and, in the more limited sense, the shelf behind an altar on which are placed the crucifix, candlesticks, and other liturgical objects. The panel is usually made of wood or stone, though sometimes of metal, and is decorated with paintings, statues, or mosaics depicting the Crucifixion or a similar subject. Although frequently forming part of the architectural structure of the church, especially in the High Gothic period, retables can be detached and sometimes, as in the case of the famous retable by Hubert and Jan van Eyck, The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb (1432; also known as the Ghent Altarpiece, St. Bavo’s Cathedral, Ghent), consist merely of a painting. Probably the most well-known retable is that in the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice, which is one of the most remarkable examples in existence of the craft of the jeweler and goldsmith. Originally commissioned in 976, the St. Mark’s retable was enlarged and enriched in the 13th century. With the development of freestanding altars, retables have become extinct in contemporary church architecture. See also altarpiece.
