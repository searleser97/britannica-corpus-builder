Sauna,  bath in steam from water thrown on heated stones, popular in gymnasiums and health clubs, with some units available for home use. The sauna may derive from baths described by Herodotus, who tells that the inhabitants of Scythia in central Eurasia threw water and hempseed on heated stones to create an intoxicating steam.
The Finnish people, however, with whom the sauna is most closely identified, made it a national tradition. The Finns built wooden enclosures near the edge of lakes. Inside were shelflike rows of flat stones that had fire space underneath, where wood was burned to heat the stones. When the stones were hot, cold water was thrown on them to create steam. While in the steam hut, bathers beat themselves with branches or paddles until their skin was red and tingling; then they dived into the cold water, or in winter they rolled in the snow. These extreme changes of body temperature were thought to have a beneficial effect on circulatory function.
