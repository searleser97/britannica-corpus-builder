Sapper,   military engineer. The name is derived from the French word sappe (“spadework,” or “trench”) and became connected with military engineering during the 17th century, when attackers dug covered trenches to approach the walls of a besieged fort. They also tunneled under those walls and then collapsed the tunnels, thus undermining the walls. These trenches and tunnels were called “saps,” and their diggers came to be called “sappers.”
In modern armies, sappers serve three functions. They provide tactical support on the battlefield by installing portable bridges, tank traps, and other construction; they build major support facilities, such as airports, supply roads, fuel depots, and barracks; and they are assigned additional tasks, including the disarming and disposal of mines and unexploded bombs and shells and the preparation and distribution of maps.
