earthfill dam, also called earth dam or embankment dam,  dam built up by compacting successive layers of earth, using the most impervious materials to form a core and placing more permeable substances on the upstream and downstream sides. A facing of crushed stone prevents erosion by wind or rain, and an ample spillway, usually of concrete, protects against catastrophic washout should water overtop the dam.
Compared with concrete, soils and rock fragments lack strength, are much more permeable, and possess less resistance to deterioration and disturbance by flowing water. These disadvantages are compensated for by a much lower cost and by the ability of earthfill to adapt to deformation caused by movements in the dam foundation. This assumes, of course, sufficient usable soil or rockfill is available near the dam site. Earthfill is often quite economical, provided that a suitable “borrow” area can be utilized close to the construction site.
Because of their great base widths, earthfill dams can be constructed on unfavourable sites, such as open-joined rock or weaker and possibly locally permeable clay. It is necessary, however, either to check or to harmlessly drain away the seepage water that would otherwise weaken the downstream parts of the dam and, in extreme cases, cause it to fail. Several countermeasures, possibly in combination, can be employed: the foundation can be grouted or a cutoff trench excavated and backfilled with an impermeable material; a drainage blanket can be constructed at the base of the downstream part of the dam, or individual drainage wells or galleries can be excavated; the length of the seepage paths under the dam can be extended by means of an impermeable blanket laid on the upstream side of the dam; or additional free-draining fill can be placed at the downstream toe of the dam.
