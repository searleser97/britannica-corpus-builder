Squinch,   in architecture, any of several devices by which a square or polygonal room has its upper corners filled in to form a support for a dome: by corbelling out the courses of masonry, each course projecting slightly beyond the one below; by building one or more arches diagonally across the corner; by building in the corner a niche with a half dome at its head; or by filling the corner with a little conical vault that has an arch on its outer diagonal face and its apex in the corner.
The arched squinch that is often used in Byzantine architecture originally seems to have been developed, almost simultaneously, by the Roman builders of the late imperial period and the Sāsānians in Persia. In Italy the Romanesque squinch form is either the conical type as in the church of Sant’Ambrogio at Milan or a succession of arched rings as in the 13th-century central tower of the abbey church at Chiaravalle. More complex forms with niches and colonnettes are characteristic of the French Romanesque of Auvergny, as in the cathedral of Le Puy-en-Velay (late 11th and early 12th centuries); churches of southwestern France, such as Saint-Hilaire at Poitiers, use conical squinches of the Italian type.
Islāmic architecture, borrowing from the Sāsānian precedent, makes great use of squinch forms (see pendentive). The stalactite work (q.v.), which is so marked a feature of later Islāmic architecture, is, in essence, merely a decorative development of a combination of niche squinch forms. In Gothic architecture squinch arches are frequently used on the insides of square towers to support octagonal spires.
