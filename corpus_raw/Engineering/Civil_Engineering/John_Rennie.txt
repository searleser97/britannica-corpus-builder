John Rennie,  (born June 7, 1761, Phantassie, East Lothian, Scotland—died October 4, 1821, London, England), Scottish civil engineer who built or improved canals, docks, harbours, and bridges throughout Britain. Three of his spans were built across the River Thames at London.
Rennie began his career as a millwright, and his first major work was designing the machinery for Matthew Boulton and James Watt’s project at the Albion Flour Mills in London. Rennie greatly extended the use of iron for gears and other parts of machinery.
In the 1790s Rennie began work on the Kennet and Avon Canal in Wiltshire and canals in Rochdale, Lancaster, and elsewhere. From about 1800 he worked on extensive drainage projects in the Lincolnshire fens; constructed or improved harbours, including Wick, Grimsby, Holyhead, and Hull; built the London and East and West India docks on the Thames; improved naval dockyards at Plymouth, Portsmouth, Chatham, and Sheerness; and began the breakwater that shelters Plymouth Sound.
Rennie is best known, however, for his London bridges: Waterloo Bridge (1811–17; replaced 1937–45), composed of masonry arches; Southwark Bridge (1814–19; replaced 1912–21), composed of three cast-iron arches; and the New London Bridge (opened in 1831 and moved more than 130 years later to Lake Havasu City, Arizona, U.S.), made of multiple masonry arches.
After Rennie’s death his sons took over his business. George, the elder, ran the mechanical engineering side, and John (later Sir John) ran the civil engineering side, including the completion of London Bridge and the Plymouth breakwater.
