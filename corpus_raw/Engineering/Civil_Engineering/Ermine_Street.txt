Ermine Street,  major Roman road in England between London and York. It ran north from Bishopsgate, London, through Ware, Royston, Godmanchester, and Ancaster to Lincoln (Lindum) and thence to York (Eboracum), crossing the River Humber at Brough. It remained one of the great roads of England until modern times. The Saxon name Ermine is also applied to the Roman road from Silchester (Calleva Attrebatum) to Cirencester (Corinium) and Gloucester (Glevum), crossing the River Thames just below Cricklade and descending the Cotswold escarpment at Birdlip.
