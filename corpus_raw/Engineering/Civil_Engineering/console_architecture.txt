Console,  in architecture, type of bracket or corbel, particularly one with a scroll-shaped profile: usually an ogee (S or inverted S curve) or double-ogee terminating in volutes (spirals) above and below. A console projects about one-half its height or less to support a windowhead, cornice, shelf, or sculpture. The difference between a console and other varieties of bracket has more to do with where it is used than its appearance, though in general a cantilever or modillion is supposed to project farther than a console in proportion to its height.
In Greece, consoles with only slight projection were employed to support door cornices. This sort of console is properly called an ancon, or ancone. The Temple of Concord, Rome (7 bceâ€“10 ce), provides one of the earliest examples of a scrolled console used to support a cornice.
