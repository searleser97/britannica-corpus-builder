Precast concrete,  Concrete cast into structural members under factory conditions and then brought to the building site. A 20th-century development, precasting increases the strength and finish durability of the member and decreases time and construction costs. Concrete cures slowly; the design strength is usually reached 28 days after initial setting. Using precast concrete eliminates the lag between the time on-site concrete is placed and the time it can carry loads. Precast concrete components include slabs, beams, columns, walls, stairways, modular boxes, and even kitchens and bathrooms with precast fixtures. See also prefabrication.
