Robert Whitehead,  (born Jan. 3, 1823, Bolton-le-Moors, Lancashire, Eng.â€”died  Nov. 14, 1905, Beckett, Berkshire), British engineer who invented the modern torpedo.
In 1856, after serving an apprenticeship in Manchester and working in Marseille, Milan, and Trieste, he organized, with local capital, a marine-engineering works, Stabilimento Tecnico Fiumano, in Fiume (now Rijeka, Croatia). There he successfully designed and built engines for Austrian warships and began to work on a torpedo, which he completed in 1866. In 1872 he bought the firm and turned it into a manufacturer of torpedoes and accessories. In 1876 he improved his vehicles by using a servo-motor that gave them a truer course through the water, and he gradually increased their speed to 29 knots for 1,000 yards. In 1896 he used a gyroscope to control the course of a torpedo.
