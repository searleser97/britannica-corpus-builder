Hammer-beam roof,  English medieval timber roof system used when a long span was needed. Not a true truss, the construction is similar to corbeled masonry (see corbel) in that each set of beams steps upward (and inward) by resting on the ones below by means of curved braces and struts. The roof of Richard IIâ€™s Westminster Hall in London (1402), with a 70-ft (21-m) span, is an excellent example.
