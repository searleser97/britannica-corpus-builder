Floor,  rigid building assembly that divides space horizontally into stories. It forms the bottom of a room. It may consist of joist-supported wood planks or panels, decking or panels supported by wood or steel beams, a slab of stone or concrete on the ground, or a reinforced-concrete slab carried by concrete beams and columns. The floor assembly must support its own dead load plus furnishings and the live load of occupants engaged in any variety of activities. The horizontal supports beneath its top surface—and the vertical supports with which they intersect to form a frame—must be sufficiently large and spaced closely enough to prevent sagging of the assembly.
