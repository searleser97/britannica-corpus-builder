Leland Stanford, in full Amasa Leland Stanford,  (born March 9, 1824, Watervliet, New York, U.S.—died June 21, 1893, Palo Alto, California), American senator from California and one of the builders of the first U.S. transcontinental railroad. Stanford is often grouped with the 19th-century entrepreneurial tycoons who were labeled “robber barons” by their critics and “captains of industry” by their champions.
Stanford practiced law in Port Washington, Wisconsin, from 1848 to 1852, before moving to Sacramento, California, where he achieved much success in retailing mining supplies and general merchandise. He also became active in local politics. A Republican, he served as governor of California from 1862 to 1863.
Stanford invested heavily in the plan to build a transcontinental railroad, and, when the Central Pacific Railroad was organized in 1861, he became its president (1861–93). He was instrumental in the success of the Central Pacific, which was built eastward to join with the Union Pacific at Promontory, Utah, in 1869. He also played a major role in railroad development throughout California and the Southwest. From 1885 until his death in 1893, he served in the U.S. Senate. Stanford and his wife, Jane, founded Stanford University in 1885.
