Egon Eiermann,  (born September 29, 1904, Neuendorf, near Berlin, Germany—died July 20, 1970, Baden-Baden, West Germany), one of the most prominent German architects to emerge after World War II, whose wide variety of buildings have been admired for their elegant proportions, precise detail, and structural clarity.
Eiermann studied at Berlin Technical University under Hans Poelzig, later working in the building department of the Karstadt department store company. Beginning in 1930 he practiced architecture in Berlin and, from 1947, in Karlsruhe, where he also served on the faculty of the university. Adhering to an aesthetic of making order visible, Eiermann created a number of major achievements in functional design, including the textile mill at Blumberg (1951), the West German pavilion at the Brussels World Exhibition (with Sep Ruf, 1958), the West German embassy in Washington, D.C. (1958–64), and the IBM-Germany Headquarters in Stuttgart (1967).
Perhaps his most popular work is the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (1956–63), a symbol of postwar Berlin. Originally, a Romanesque revival building constructed in 1891–95 stood on the site, but a World War II bombing raid destroyed much of the building. Eiermann incorporated the remnants of the bell tower into his modern church, a polygonal building popularly known as “the Egg-Crate” (in part this is a play on Eiermann’s name; the German word Eier means “eggs”).
