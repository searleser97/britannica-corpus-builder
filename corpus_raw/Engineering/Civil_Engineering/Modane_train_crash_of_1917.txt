Modane train crash of 1917,  train derailment in Modane, France, on Dec. 12, 1917, that killed more than 500 French soldiers.
The French train was traveling from Turin, Italy, to Lyon, France, through a stretch of the Alps in southeastern France. It was carrying more than 1,000 soldiers, who had been stationed in northern Italy while fighting in World War I. The trip was planned as a reprieve from combat, with many of the men planning to reunite with their families for the Christmas holiday.
Only one locomotive pulled the 19 cars. Though the locomotive could effectively move the heavy load, the trainâ€™s engineer reportedly had warned French officials that the train would likely be unable to brake fully on hills. As the train moved out of a tunnel, it began descending a steep hill. The train lost control as it neared the bottom of the hill, where it ran over a bridge and derailed. The train cars were made mostly of wood and immediately began to burn. Many of the hundreds of victims were unidentifiable. The engineer survived the accident.
