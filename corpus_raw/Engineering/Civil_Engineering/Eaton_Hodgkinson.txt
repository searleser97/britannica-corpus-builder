Eaton Hodgkinson,  (born Feb. 26, 1789, Anderton, Cheshire, Eng.—died June 18, 1861, Higher Broughton, near Manchester), English mathematician and civil engineer. From 1847 he taught at University College in London. He researched the strength of materials, including cast iron and developed a concept for determining the neutral line (where stress changes from tension to compression) in a beam subject to bending. His work led to experiments in materials strength to determine the strongest construction beam and to the eventual design of the I-beam, also known as the “Hodgkinson’s beam.”
