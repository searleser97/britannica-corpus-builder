Pneumatic structure,  Membrane structure that is stabilized by the pressure of compressed air. Air-supported structures are supported by internal air pressure. A network of cables stiffens the fabric, and the assembly is supported by a rigid ring at the edge. The air pressure within this bubble is increased slightly above normal atmospheric pressure and maintained by compressors or fans. Air locks are required at entrances to prevent loss of internal air pressure. Air-supported membranes were first devised by Walter Bird in the late 1940s and were soon put to use as covers for swimming pools, temporary warehouses, and exhibition buildings. Air-inflated structures are supported by pressurized air within inflated building elements that are shaped to carry loads in a traditional manner. Pneumatic structures are perhaps the most cost-effective type of building for very long spans.
