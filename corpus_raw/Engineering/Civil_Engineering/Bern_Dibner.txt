Bern Dibner,  (born Aug. 18, 1897, Lisianka, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died  Jan. 6, 1988, Wilton, Conn., U.S.), American engineer and historian of science.
Dibner arrived in the United States in 1904. After graduating from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now Polytechnic University), New York City, in 1921, he worked with the Electric Bond and Share Company (1923–25), where he participated in work leading to the electrification of Cuba. In 1924 he founded the Burndy Engineering Company (now Burndy Corporation) to manufacture solderless electrical connectors that he had invented. He retired in 1972.
Dibner was noted as a historian of science. He established two extensive book collections—the Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology (1975), a 10,000-volume collection now located at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and the Burndy Library (1935), a 40,000-volume collection in Norwalk, Conn. In 1972 the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology was established at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.
