Promenade,  place for strolling, where persons walk (or, in the past, ride) at leisure for exercise, display, or pleasure. Vehicular traffic may or may not be restricted. Promenades are located in resort towns and in parks and are public avenues landscaped in a pleasing manner or commanding a view.
The Royal Crescent at Bath, Somerset, England, is an 18th-century example of a promenade, and the Boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey, is a modern example. Large cities not devoted to a leisured life, or class, rarely include a walk that is exclusively a promenade because the pace of contemporary life set by the automobile, and the chance of being a victim of crime, detract from its original purpose as a place for strolling.
