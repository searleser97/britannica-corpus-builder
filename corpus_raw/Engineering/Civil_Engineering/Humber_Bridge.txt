Humber Bridge,  suspension bridge extending across the River Humber at Hessle about 8 km (5 miles) west of Kingston upon Hull, England. It connects East Riding of Yorkshire with North Lincolnshire. Its 1,410-metre (4,626-foot) main span is one of the longest in the world, and it has a total length of 2,220 metres (7,283 feet). The main span is suspended between towers that rise 152 metres (500 feet) above their supporting piers. It carries a four-lane highway and pedestrian walkways.
The Humber Bridge was opened in July 1981 after more than eight years of construction. Its total cost exceeded $250,000,000. The building of the bridge had caused much controversy both because of the high cost and because the bridge site was not along a heavily traveled route. The Town Council of Kingston upon Hull, however, proceeded with its construction in an effort to stimulate industrial and commercial development in the area.
