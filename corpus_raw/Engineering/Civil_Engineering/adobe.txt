Adobe,  a heavy clay soil used to make sun-dried bricks. The term, Spanish-Moorish in origin, also denotes the bricks themselves.
Adobe is a mixture of clay, sand, and silt with good plastic qualities that will dry to a hard uniform mass. In areas with arid or semiarid climates, adobe construction dates back several millennia. This use of earth for building construction resulted partly from the scarcity of wood as a building medium, partly from the ease of such construction, and partly from its insulation value against both heat and cold. Adobe or sun-dried bricks are found in the Old World in the dry areas east of the Mediterranean Sea, in North Africa, and in southern Spain. In the Western Hemisphere adobe appears in many of the pre-Columbian sites from the American Southwest to Peru, always, again, in those regions with a dry climate. The American Indians built walls by hand manipulation of the plastic clay into courses, allowing each course to dry before adding the next. In the 20th century, adobe also became a fashionable construction material in the American Southwest.
Water and small amounts of straw or other fibrous material are mixed with a clay soil, which is then shaped into bricks in simple molds. Depending on intended use, the bricks range from 8 to 13 cm (3 to 5 inches) thick, 25 to 30 cm wide, and 35 to 50 cm long. Before they can be used, the bricks must be “air” cured, which usually takes at least two weeks in arid climates. The addition of fibre is solely to prevent the bricks from cracking during the curing process.
Adobe walls are normally built on a solid, waterproof foundation of stone or concrete; otherwise the capillary action of groundwater may cause the lower courses to disintegrate. The bricks are laid in a mortar of the same material, then finished with a coat of adobe or with lime or cement plaster. With proper construction and maintenance, an adobe wall may last centuries.
