Pīṭhā,  “seats,” or “benches,” of the Goddess, usually numbered at 108 and associated with the parts of the deity’s body and with the various aspects of her divine female power, or śakti. Many of the 108 pīṭhās have become important pilgrimage sites for members of the Shakti sects of Hinduism.
The origin myth for the creation of the pīṭhās is recounted in several texts, most fully in the Mahabharata and the Brahma-purana. The legend concerns the Goddess Sati, daughter of Daksa and wife of Shiva. When Daksa held a great sacrifice and refused to invite Shiva and Sati, Sati took offence, came to the sacrifice uninvited, and there committed suicide. Shiva thereupon became enraged, killed Daksa, and destroyed the sacrifice. Carrying the body of Sati on his shoulder, he began a dance that threatened the cosmos. The gods, in order to stop Shiva’s dance, caused the body of Sati to disintegrate, whereupon the parts of her body fell to earth.
The pīṭhās are scattered throughout India, with a high concentration in West Bengal. Each pīṭhā is located on or near a body of water believed to be infused with the energy of the Goddess; here the pilgrims bathe. Many are also near trees that are identified with the Goddess as Earth Mother, and the images of the various female deities at the pīṭhās are accompanied by the appropriate animal companions, or vāhanas. Every pīṭhā is also associated with a manifestation of Shiva.
The pīṭhās are places where believers can interact and communicate with the manifest deity, and taken together they represent the Goddess’s body on earth, as well as a symbol of the unity of all the various temples and traditions of Shaktism. See tirtha.
