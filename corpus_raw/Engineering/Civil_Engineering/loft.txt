Loft,   in architecture, upper space within a building, or a large undivided space in a building used principally for storage in business or industry. In churches the rood loft is a display gallery above the rood screen, and a choir or organ loft is a gallery reserved for church singers and musicians. In theatres a loft is the area above and behind the proscenium.
In comparison with an attic, a loft is usually opened on one side, similar to a balcony, as with a hayloftâ€”the space under the roof of a barn. Sleeping lofts are often constructed in smaller dwellings to give more space. In many modern cities where living space is at a premium, industrial lofts are converted into residences, with tenants subdividing the open area to fit their needs.
