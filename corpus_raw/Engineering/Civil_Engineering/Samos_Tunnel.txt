Tunnel of Eupalinos, also called Eupalinian Aqueduct or Samos Tunnel,  tunnel drilled on the Aegean island of SÃ¡mos in the 6th century bce, one of the major feats of ancient engineering. The tunnel was dug to carry water for the capital city of the tyrant Polycrates from springs on the far side of Mount Kastro. It was built, according to Herodotus, by the engineer Eupalinos of Megara. Two metres (six feet) in diameter and more than 914 metres (3,000 feet) in length, it was drilled through the rock by teams of enslaved people using hammers and chisels. Advanced from two headings on opposite sides of the mountain, it failed to align with precision, but the junction was achieved by making a U-turn in the middle. The aqueduct operated for more than 1,000 years. Visitors can walk the entire length of the tunnel.
