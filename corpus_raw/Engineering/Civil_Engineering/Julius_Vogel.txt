Sir Julius Vogel,  (born Feb. 24, 1835, London—died  March 12, 1899, East Molesey, Surrey, Eng.), New Zealand statesman, journalist, and businessman known for his bold project to regenerate New Zealand’s economy in the 1870s through large-scale public works financed by British loans.
Attracted by gold discoveries in Victoria, Vogel emigrated to Australia in 1852 and became successful in business and journalism. He moved to Otago, N.Z., in 1861 after being badly defeated for public office and soon guided the Otago Daily Times to a leading position in the colony. Elected to Parliament in 1863, he led the opposition (1865–68) and became colonial treasurer in 1869 in the ministry of William Fox. This was the beginning of a “continuous ministry” during which Vogel, whatever office he held, was the real holder of power in the government of New Zealand. Where it suited his purpose, Vogel implemented policies that had been planned by others, such as the abolition of provincial governments. He also picked the men who formed ministries and headed the government for more than a decade.
Vogel’s financial skills, particularly in negotiating loans from the British government, enabled him to develop his own policies. His development scheme, which he implemented as colonial treasurer (1869–72) and prime minister (1873–75, 1876), entailed the building of transportation and communication facilities and other public works. He was knighted in 1875.
A staunch advocate of the extension of British power in the Pacific, Vogel’s agitation helped persuade Britain to annex Fiji in 1874. From 1876 to 1880 he served as agent-general in London and reentered New Zealand politics in 1884 as the real power in the ministry of Sir Robert Stout (1884–87). Vogel was unable to stave off economic depression in New Zealand, however, and he resigned his parliamentary seat in 1889, the year of publication of his novel Anno Domini 2000: Or Woman’s Destiny, which projected his ideas on empire and finance to the year 2000.
