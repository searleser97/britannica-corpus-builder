Ron Toomer, in full Ronald Valentine Toomer,  (born May 31, 1930, Pasadena, California, U.S.—died September 26, 2011, Bedford, Texas), American engineer and roller coaster designer who could be considered the sovereign of steel coasters. His work with Arrow Dynamics (founded as Arrow Development Company in 1946) brought to life such influential steel thrillers as the tubular track Runaway Mine Ride (1966), the inverted helix-shaped Corkscrew (1975), and the first suspended coasters of the 1980s.
A mechanical engineering graduate of the University of Nevada–Reno (1961, B.S.), Toomer was involved in the first U.S. satellite launches and served on the team that designed the heat shield for the Apollo spacecraft. During his stint in the space program, Toomer met a coworker who had previously been a welder for the Arrow Development Company. In 1965 Toomer joined the company and was hired to work on the design of the Runaway Mine Ride, the world’s first all-steel coaster.
In more than 30 years in the amusement industry, Toomer designed more than 80 steel coasters worldwide. In 1975 he built one of the first looping coasters of the modern era—the Corkscrew at Knott’s Berry Farm (Buena Park, California), which was followed the next year by one at Cedar Point (Sandusky, Ohio). The Corkscrew brought 360-degree rolls to coaster design for the first time. Other achievements by Toomer included Cedar Point’s beloved Magnum XL-200 (1989), an out-and-back coaster that was the first to top 200 feet (60 metres), and also the first suspended coasters, Big Bad Wolf (1984) at Busch Gardens, Williamsburg, Virginia, and Cedar Point’s Iron Dragon (1987). All this time he gained fame for never riding his own creations, declaring, “I’ve had a bad motion sickness problem since I was a little kid. But I’ve ridden enough of them to know what happens and how it feels.”
Toomer became president of Arrow Dynamics in 1986, at about  the time that the company was developing the innovative Pipeline coaster, on which the cars execute a snap roll of 182 degrees around their longitudinal axis. Unfortunately, the highly complex project ran out of funds before it could be realized as anything more than a prototype. In the 1990s Toomer held posts as chairman of the board and as director. In 2000 he was inducted into the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions Hall of Fame.
