Immersed tube, also called Sunken Tube,  technique of underwater tunneling used principally for underwater crossings. The method was pioneered by the American engineer W.J. Wilgus in the Detroit River in 1903 for the Michigan Central Railroad. Wilgus dredged a trench in the riverbed, floated segments of steel tube into position, and sank them; the segments were locked together by divers and pumped out and could then be covered with excavated material. Though the technique has been refined since, it remains basically the same and has been used for many underwater tunnels all over the world.
