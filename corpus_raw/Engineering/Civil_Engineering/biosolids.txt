Biosolids,  sewage sludge, the residues remaining from the treatment of sewage. For use as a fertilizer in agricultural applications, biosolids must first be stabilized through processing, such as digestion or the addition of lime, to reduce concentrations of heavy metals and harmful organisms (certain bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens). This processing also reduces the volume of material and stabilizes the organic matter in it, thus reducing the potential for odours. Use of biosolids in agriculture has become controversial, critics claiming that even treated sewage may harbour harmful bacteria, viruses, and heavy metals.
