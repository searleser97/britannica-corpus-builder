Saltbox,   in architecture, type of residential building popular in colonial New England, having two stories in front and a single story in the rear and a double-sloped roof that is longer over the rear section.The original clapboard houses of the New England settlers were constructed around a great central chimney. On the first floor were two large rooms, the hall and the parlour. Upstairs were bedrooms.
As families grew both in size and in prosperity, it became traditional to move the kitchen out of the hall into a lean-to constructed at the back of the house. The pitched roof was then extended downward over the new kitchen, creating the characteristic long-in-back silhouette that gave the house its name. Late in the 17th century the lean-to was often included as part of the original design of a house. Well-preserved saltbox houses can still be seen in New England.
