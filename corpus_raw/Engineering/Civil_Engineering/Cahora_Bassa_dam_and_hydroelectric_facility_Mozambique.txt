Cahora Bassa, also spelled Cabora Bassa,  arch dam and hydroelectric facility on the Zambezi River in western Mozambique. The dam, located about 80 miles (125 km) northwest of Tete, is 560 feet (171 m) high and 994 feet (303 m) wide at the crest. It has a volume of 667,000,000 cubic yards (510,000,000 cubic m).
The dam impounds Lake Cahora Bassa, which is 150 miles (240 km) long and 19 miles (31 km) wide at its widest point. The lake has a capacity of 51,075,000 acre-feet (63,000,000,000 cubic m) and extends to the Zambia-Mozambique border. The dam was built by a consortium of Portuguese, German, British, and South African companies; construction of the dam began in 1969 and was completed in 1974. The last of five 425-megawatt generators was installed in 1979. Cahora Bassa dam supplies power primarily to South Africa over an 870-mile- (1,400-kilometre-) long, dual 530-kilowatt transmission line and also to Maputo, Tete, and the Moatize coal mines near the town of Tete. Power transmission to South Africa was interrupted during the Mozambican civil war but resumed during the mid-1990s. The Companhia Hidroel√©ctrica de Cahora Bassa was owned by Portugal until 1992.
