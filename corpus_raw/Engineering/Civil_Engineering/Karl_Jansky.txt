Karl Jansky, in full Karl Guthe Jansky,  (born October 22, 1905, Norman, Oklahoma, U.S.—died February 14, 1950, Red Bank, New Jersey), American engineer whose discovery of radio waves from an extraterrestrial source inaugurated the development of radio astronomy, a new science that from the mid-20th century greatly extended the range of astronomical observations.
In 1928 Jansky joined the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey, where his assignment was to track down and identify the various forms of interference that were plaguing telephone communications. He built a linear, directional antenna by which he was able to identify all the sources of interference except one. After months of study he discovered in 1931 that the source of the unidentified radio interference came from the stars. By the following spring he concluded that the source lay in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, which Harlow Shapley and Jan Oort had established as the direction of the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy.
Jansky published his findings in late 1932 but did not pursue the further development of radio astronomy, a task performed by the American engineer and amateur astronomer Grote Reber. In honour of Jansky’s epoch-making discovery, the unit of radio-wave emission strength was named the jansky.
