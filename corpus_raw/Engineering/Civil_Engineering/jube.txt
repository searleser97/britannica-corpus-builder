Jube,  (from the French jubé), construction marking off the chancel, or sanctuary, of a church from the rest of the interior. Its mature medieval form consisted of three basic elements: a screen (known in England as a rood screen); a gallery, or loft, from which the words Jube, Domine, benedicere (hence jubé) were spoken; and a crucifix (rood) surmounting the whole. See rood screen.
