Chain mail, also called Mail,  form of body armour worn by European knights and other military men throughout most of the medieval period. An early form of mail, made by sewing iron rings to fabric or leather, was worn in late Roman times and may have originated in Asia, where such mail continued to be worn for many centuries.
Medieval armourers improved on the early version by fabricating mail independent of cloth or leather and by interlacing the rings, which were firmly closed by welding or riveting. In earlier versions, such as that worn by Charlemagne in a representation of 773, the shirt, or coat, was short, with a separate sleeve for the sword arm. In later models, such as those depicted in the Bayeux tapestry (1066), the coat was long, fully sleeved, and divided to facilitate horseback riding. A hood, usually fitting under a helmet, covered the head and neck. A padded undergarment was worn to protect against bruises. By the 12th century, mail was fitted to feet and legs, and to hands in the form of mittens or gauntlets. The addition of plates to increase protection for breast and back gradually evolved in the 14th century into complete plate armour, displacing mail. See also armour.
