Arden L. Bement, Jr., in full Arden Lee Bement, Jr.,  (born May 22, 1932, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S.), American metallurgical engineer who served as director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) from 2004 to 2010.
Bement attended the Colorado School of Mines, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in metallurgical engineering (1954). He went on to earn a master’s degree (1959) at the University of Idaho and a doctorate (1963) from the University of Michigan. His early career in private industry included positions as a researcher at the General Electric Co. (1954–65) and manager of the metallurgy research department at Battelle Northwest Laboratories (1965–70; now Pacific Northwest Laboratories) before he joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1970.
In 1976 Bement became director of the Office of Materials Science at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense, and in 1979 he became U.S. deputy undersecretary of defense for research and engineering. A year later he returned to private industry, joining TRW Inc. as its vice president of technical resources and of science and technology. In 1992 Bement began his second stint in academia at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he became head of the nuclear engineering department.
In 2001 U.S. Pres. George W. Bush appointed Bement director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Under Bement’s leadership, NIST took a more active role in national security following the September 11, 2001, attacks. In addition to conducting a major investigation into the collapse of the World Trade Center towers and researching new methods of cybersecurity to protect the country’s utilities from computer attacks, NIST took a leading role in developing new biometric technologies, such as fingerprint scanning and metal detection. In 2004 Bement became acting director and then director of NSF, where he promoted education and research initiatives to strengthen the country’s ability to function in an era of economic change. He remained with the agency until 2010. Bement then returned to Purdue University, where he served as director (2010–12) of the school’s Global Policy Research Institute.
