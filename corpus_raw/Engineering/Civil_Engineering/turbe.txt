Türbe, (Turkish: “tomb-tower”, ) Persian Gonbad,  form of mausoleum architecture developed by and popular among the Seljuq Turks in Iran (mid-11th to 13th century) and later carried by them into Iraq and Anatolia.
The tower form of the tomb may have been based on the cylindrical and conical forms of Seljuq tents. The earliest towers, varying in height up to 200 feet (60 m), were traditionally built on a circular ground plan, but square and polygonal configurations had become popular by the 12th century.
The oldest surviving türbe is the Gonbad-e Qābūs, in the Gorgān region of northeastern Iran, which was built in 1006–07 for the emir Shams al-Maʿālī Qābūs (d. 1012). The tower rises to a height of 200 feet (60 m). Its conical roof created a type, but its 10-pointed, star-shaped ground plan remained unique. An example of the more common, round form is the türbe at Radkan, in Rayy, dated roughly to the 13th century. It is ornate, as Persian monuments tended to be, featuring the deeply incised, regular, concave grooves known as fluting.
In Anatolia, türbe architecture was simpler but no less monumental than that of Iran. A number have survived there, the earliest dated from the 12th century. Round and polygonal forms occur with equal frequency. The interior typically has a vaulted dome; the exterior, a cone. These forms were used continually from their introduction in the 12th century through the early Ottoman period (14th century). Although under the Ottomans the domed mausoleum became more popular than the funerary tower, türbes were still being built in the 17th century.
