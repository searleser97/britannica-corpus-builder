Alexandre Alberto da Rocha de Serpa Pinto,  (born April 20, 1846, Portugalâ€”died  Dec. 28, 1900, Lisbon), Portuguese explorer and colonial administrator who crossed southern and central Africa on a difficult expedition and mapped the interior of the continent.
Serpa Pinto went to eastern Africa in 1869 on an exploration of the Zambezi River. Eight years later he led an expedition from Benguela, Angola, into the basins of the Congo and Zambezi rivers and investigated the country between the west-coast Portuguese colony of Angola and Mozambique on the east coast. When he completed the mission in 1879, he had traveled through Angola and parts of present-day Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the Republic of South Africa. His expedition gave impetus to a scheme for a coast-to-coast Portuguese colony, but the plan was scrapped in 1888 after a British ultimatum. In 1887 he was named consul general to Zanzibar and, in 1889, governor-general of Mozambique.
