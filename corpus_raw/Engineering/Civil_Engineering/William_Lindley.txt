William Lindley,  (born September 7, 1808, London, England—died  May 22, 1900, Blackheath, London), British civil engineer who helped renovate the German city of Hamburg after a major fire.
Lindley engaged in railway work on the European continent and settled in Hamburg as engineer in chief to the Hamburg-Bergedorf Railway (1838–60). On May 5, 1842, a fire broke out in Hamburg, raging for three days. Lindley organized strong measures to check it, including blowing up the town hall. He was afterward appointed consulting engineer to the burned city, and he surveyed it and drew up a plan for its complete rebuilding. He constructed a system of sewers, waterworks (1844–48), gasworks (1846), and public baths and washhouses, and he planned extensions to the port that were carried out in 1854.
He left Hamburg in 1860, working in many other cities as consulting engineer (1865–79). He constructed a sewerage system for Frankfurt am Main that was widely imitated in Europe and America. He also worked in Warsaw, Budapest, Düsseldorf, Galaƫi (Romania), and Basel and carried out works in Helgoland for the British government.
