floodgate,  gate for shutting out or releasing the flow of water over spillways, in connection with the operation of a dam. Important safety features of many types of dams, floodgates and spillways direct excess water away from the dam and its foundation to prevent erosion that could lead to catastrophic dam failure.
Several forms of gates have been developed. The simplest and oldest form is a vertical-lift gate that, sliding or rolling against guides, can be raised to allow water to flow underneath. Radial, or tainter, gates are similar in principle but are curved in vertical section to better resist water pressure. Tilting gates consist of flaps held by hinges along their lower edges that permit water to flow over the top when they are lowered. Vertical lift and radial gates are generally placed at the top of the spillway crest.
Drum gates rotate backward, lowering their tops and permitting a measured flow over the top of the gates. Drum gates can control the reservoir level upstream to precise levels automatically and without the assistance of mechanical power. One drum gate design consists of a shaped-steel caisson held in position by hinges mounted on the crest of the dam and supported in a flotation chamber constructed immediately downstream of the crest. Water pressure in the reservoir and buoyancy of the caisson in the flotation chamber hold the caisson in rotational equilibrium. Raising or lowering the water level in the flotation chamber causes the caisson to rotate in the same direction, thus reducing or increasing flow from the reservoir over the gate. This action can be linked to and operated automatically by a float control device in the reservoir. Drum gates present the fewest problems in the passage of ice or drift over the spillway.
