Choir,   in architecture, area of a church designed to accommodate the liturgical singers, located in the chancel, between the nave and the altar. In some churches the choir is separated from the nave by an ornamental partition called a choir screen, or more frequently by a choir rail.
Earliest church architecture set no space aside for the clergy who sang the service; but as church ritual became more elaborate, beginning in the 10th century, it required more space for increased numbers of participants. At first the choir contained simple, unattached chairs, but by Gothic times the seats had developed into choir stalls, built-in rows of prayer rests and hinged seats, which, when folded, often revealed misericords—projections used for support during long periods of standing.
The stalls are usually arranged in two sets of stepped rows along the edges of the choir, facing each other and at right angles to the altar. Gothic craftsmen carved the wooden stalls elaborately—with animal forms, biblical scenes, or abstract designs. Frequently, wooden canopies over each stall, and high arms between them, made each seat resemble a separate little building. Outstanding examples of ornate choir stalls are those at the Convent of St. Thomas in Ávila, Spain, and those designed by Grinling Gibbons in St. Paul’s Cathedral, London.
Many modern churches have singers situated in a “choir loft,” or on a balcony.
