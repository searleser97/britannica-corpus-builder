Ultraviolet lamp, also called Black-light Lamp,  device for producing electromagnetic radiations in the wavelengths between those of visible light and X-rays. The Sunâ€™s rays are rich in such radiation, sometimes referred to as black light because it is not visible to the unaided eye. The ultraviolet lamp usually consists of an electric discharge lamp with material that yields radiations at the desired wavelength. Ultraviolet lamps are usually housed in quartz or special glass that transmits ultraviolet radiation more readily than ordinary glass. Ultraviolet lamps were developed for medical use after the germicidal qualities of ultraviolet light were discovered about 1900 by the Danish physician Niels Ryberg Finsen. Modern lamps are also used in industry and research, in producing artificial suntans, and in creating special effects in lighting stages and displays with fluorescent materials.
