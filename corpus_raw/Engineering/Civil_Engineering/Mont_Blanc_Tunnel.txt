Mont Blanc Tunnel,  major Alpine automotive tunnel connecting France and Italy. It is 11.7 km (7.3 miles) long and crosses under the highest mountain in Europe, Mont Blanc. The tunnel is notable for its solution of a difficult ventilation problem and for being the first large rock tunnel to be excavated full-face—i.e., with the entire diameter of the tunnel bore drilled and blasted. Otherwise it was conventionally driven from two headings, the Italian and French crews beginning work in 1958 and 1959, respectively, and meeting in August 1962. Many difficulties, including an avalanche that swept the Italian camp in which three workers were killed and more than 30 injured, were overcome during its construction, and, when the tunnel opened in 1965, it was the longest vehicular tunnel in the world. It fulfilled a 150-year-old dream and is of great economic importance, providing a significantly shortened year-round automotive route between the two countries.
In March 1999 a two-day fire killed 39 people and caused extensive damage to the tunnel, forcing it to close. It reopened to car traffic in March 2002 and to trucks and buses in the following months. Protesters, citing environmental and safety concerns, opposed the tunnel’s reopening, especially its use by heavy trucks. The devastating fire led many countries to issue revised safety standards for tunnel design and engineering, including sprinkler systems, emergency response plans, and two-way ventilation systems that can quickly withdraw suffocating smoke.
