Jean Bullant,  (born 1520?, Écouen, France—died  1578, Écouen), a dominant figure in French architecture during the period of the Wars of Religion (1562–98), whose works represent the transition from High Renaissance to Mannerist design.
In his youth Bullant studied in Italy, and his exposure to the ancient buildings there had a profound influence on his later work. Returning to France about 1540, he entered the service of the constable of Montmorency. At Écouen, Bullant worked on the constable’s château, which clearly evidences the effect of Bullant’s exposure to the Pantheon in Rome. At Fére-en-Tardenois (1552–62) he constructed a bridge and gallery in which he created the effect of a Roman aqueduct built across a gorge. The placement of the window over the main door, with its penetration into the pediment, represents Bullant’s use of the artificiality and formalism of Mannerism. In about 1560, he built the Petit-Château for the constable of Montmorency’s château at Chantilly, which also reflects Bullant’s Mannerist style.
Little more is known of Bullant’s life and work until 1570, when he was appointed as Catherine de Médicis’ architect. He contributed to the Chapelle des Valois and added a wing to the Tuileries, although the exact nature of his contribution is not known. His influential Régle générale d ’architecture des cinq manières de colonnes (1564) was adopted as one of the textbooks of French architecture.
