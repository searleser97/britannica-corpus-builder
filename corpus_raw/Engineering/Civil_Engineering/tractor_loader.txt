Tractor loader,   tractor carrying a front-mounted bucket that can be raised, lowered, and tilted forward and backward hydraulically. It is forced into the digging by forward motion of the tractor and retracted and swung by backing and steering the tractor. Tractor loaders are used primarily for loading trucks, digging basements, and doing bulldozer work. They also transport material over moderate distances.
