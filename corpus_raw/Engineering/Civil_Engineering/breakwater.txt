Breakwater,   artificial offshore structure protecting a harbour, anchorage, or marina basin from water waves. Breakwaters intercept longshore currents and tend to prevent beach erosion. Over the long term, however, the processes of erosion and sedimentation cannot be effectively overcome by interfering with currents and the supply of sediment. Deposition of sediment at one site will be compensated for by erosion elsewhere; this phenomenon occurs whether one breakwater or a series of such structures is erected. Compare jetty.
