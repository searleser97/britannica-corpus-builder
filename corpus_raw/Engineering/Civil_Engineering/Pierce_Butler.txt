Pierce Butler,  (born March 17, 1866, near Northfield, Minn., U.S.—died  Nov. 16, 1939, Washington, D.C.), associate justice of the United States Supreme Court (1923–39).
Butler was admitted to the Minnesota bar in 1888. After serving as assistant county attorney and then county attorney in St. Paul, he formed a law firm and, over 25 years, became the foremost railroad attorney of the Northwest. During the latter part of this period he was occasionally called upon to prosecute antitrust cases for President William Howard Taft’s attorney general, George Wickersham; on another occasion he saved substantial sums for the Canadian government in valuation proceedings against the western railroads. In 1922 Butler was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Warren G. Harding on the recommendation of Chief Justice Taft and over the objections of liberal Senators George W. Norris and Robert M. La Follette.
Butler was a strict constitutional constructionist, voting with the conservative bloc of justices Willis Van Devanter, James C. McReynolds, and George Sutherland on many issues. He opposed government control of business, consistently voted against the imposition of state and federal taxes, and joined with the court’s majority in voting down two important New Deal programs, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the National Recovery Administration.
