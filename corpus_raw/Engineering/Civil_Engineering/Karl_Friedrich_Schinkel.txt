Karl Friedrich Schinkel,  (born March 13, 1781, near Brandenburg, Brandenburg—died  Oct. 9, 1841, Berlin), German architect and painter whose Romantic–Classical creations in other related arts made him the leading arbiter of national aesthetic taste in his lifetime.
The son of an archdeacon, Schinkel studied architecture with the brilliant Friedrich Gilly (1798–1800) and at Berlin’s Academy of Architecture (1800–02), followed by several years in Italy. Returning to Berlin via Paris (1805), he became a painter. He designed furniture for Queen Louise in 1809 that, with its rich, light-coloured pearwood, play of matched grains, and romantic simplification of form in a classical milieu, anticipated the forthcoming Biedermeier period.
Becoming state architect of Prussia in 1815, Schinkel executed many commissions for King Frederick William III and other members of the royal family. His designs were based on the revival of various historical styles of architecture; e.g., Greek Revival buildings such as the Königschauspelhaus, Berlin (1818), and the Altes Museum, Berlin (1822–30). His designs for a mausoleum for Louise (1810) and the brick and terra-cotta Werdersche Kirche, Berlin (1821–30), are among the earliest Gothic Revival designs in Europe.
In 1824 Schinkel visited Italy again and in 1826 travelled through Scotland and England. Appointed director (1830) of the Prussian Office of Public Works, he decorated apartments for Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm and Prince August. His work as a city planner resulted in new boulevards and squares in Berlin. Also remembered for his stage and ironwork designs, he designed scenery for Goethe’s plays, bathing the whole stage in an atmosphere of picturesque illusion.
