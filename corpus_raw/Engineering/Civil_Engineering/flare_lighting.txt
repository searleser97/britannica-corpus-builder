Flare,   combustible device used to emit a dazzlingly bright light for signaling or illumination on railroads and highways and in military operations. In pyrotechnics the term is applied either to a coloured-fire composition burned in a loose heap or to a similar composition rolled into a paper case to ensure longer and more regular burning.
The flare in its present form dates from the early part of the 19th century, when the introduction of potassium chlorate permitted the development of chemical mixtures to produce coloured light. Previous to this the only colour had been the bluish white light produced by a mixture of sulfur, saltpetre, and orpiment. These blue lights, as they were called, were and still are often used at sea for signaling and illumination. They were also known as Bengal lights, probably because Bengal was the chief source of saltpetre.
The introduction of colours that could readily be recognized at a considerable distance opened up a much wider field for the use of flares at sea. From the middle of the 19th century, many patents were granted, most of them for a means of self-ignition. Subsequent inventions provided for ignition on the same principle as the modern safety match and for the waterproofing of the surface. Lights of this kind are usually fitted with a wooden handle.
Coloured flares of high light intensity are carried as standard equipment in shipsâ€™ lifeboats; the high intensity is obtained by the incorporation of magnesium, or magnesium alloy, in the composition. Flares are also used to warn motorists of highway obstructions. Commercial highway vehicles carry flares to be used in the event of distress or breakdown.
