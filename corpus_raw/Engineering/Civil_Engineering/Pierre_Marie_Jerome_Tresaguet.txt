Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet,  (born 1716, France—died  1796, France), French engineer known for his introduction of modern road-building ideas.
Youngest son of a family of engineers, Trésaguet served many years in the Corps des Ponts et Chaussées (Bridges and Highways Corps), first in Paris as a subinspector and later in Limoges as chief engineer. Appointed inspector general in 1775, he prepared a memoir describing in detail a method of building a hard-surfaced roadway by successive courses of broken stone. Trésaguet’s base, consisting of flat stones set on edge and hammered in, was laid parallel to the curving road surface, providing good strength and drainage. His basic design, first employed in a highway from Paris to the Spanish border via Toulouse, spread to Central Europe and Sweden and was adopted by the Scottish road builder Thomas Telford.
