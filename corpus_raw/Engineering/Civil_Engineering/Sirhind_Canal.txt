Sirhind Canal,  canal in Punjab state, northwestern India. It opened in 1882 and consists of an extensive canal system that irrigates more than 5,200 square km (2,000 square miles) of farmland. The systemâ€™s headworks, where it draws its water, are on the Sutlej River at Ropar, near the border of Himachal Pradesh state. From there the canal runs west-southwest to Doraha, where it splits into three branches. One flows west and then northwest to rejoin the Sutlej near the Pakistan border, one runs southwest past Bathinda to the border of Rajasthan state, and the third flows southeast to Patiala. There are many distributaries, in addition to the three principal branches.
