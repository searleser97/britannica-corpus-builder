John Hopkinson,  (born July 27, 1849, Manchester, Eng.—died  Aug. 27, 1898, Mount Petite Dent de Veisivi, Switz.), British engineer and physicist who invented the three-wire system for electricity distribution and improved the design and efficiency of electric generators. In 1872 he became engineering manager of Chance Brothers and Company, a glass manufacturer in Birmingham, where he studied the problems of lighthouse illumination and advocated the use of flashing groups of lights for more efficient lighthouse operation.
He also studied electrostatic storage capacity, the phenomenon of residual charge, and other problems arising from the electromagnetic theory of James Clerk Maxwell.
Hopkinson set up a successful practice as an electrical-engineering consultant in 1878. In collaboration with his brother Edward, he worked out the general theory of alternating current and the operation of ac generators in parallel (i.e., operation together to produce current over one line).
In 1890 he became a professor at King’s College, London, where he was placed in charge of the newly founded Siemens Laboratory. Hopkinson, together with a son and two daughters, was killed in an accident while climbing Mount Petite Dent de Veisivi.
