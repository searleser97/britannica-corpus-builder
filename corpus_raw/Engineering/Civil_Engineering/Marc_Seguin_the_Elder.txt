Marc Séguin, the Elder, French Marc Séguin, Aîné,  (born April 20, 1786, Annonay, Fr.—died  Feb. 24, 1875, Annonay), French engineer and inventor of the wire-cable suspension bridge and the tubular steam-engine boiler.
A nephew of Joseph Montgolfier, the pioneer balloonist, Séguin developed an early interest in machinery, pursuing his studies informally but so successfully that by 1822 he was carrying out promising experiments on the strength of wire cables. With his brother Camille he studied the principles of the suspension bridge, at that time built with chain cables. Over the Rhône River at Tournon in 1824 the two brothers erected a bridge suspended from cables made of parallel wire strands, the first of a succession of such modern bridges all over the world. Séguin was also one of the first to suggest the solution to the problem of deflection under load by the addition of web trusses on either side of the roadway.
The advent of the railroad drew Séguin’s attention to the problem of locomotive power. His invention of the multiple-fire-tube boiler, in place of the water-tube boiler used by the earlier steam engines, marked a decisive advance; George Stephenson used the Séguin-type boiler in his Rocket locomotive that won the competition of 1829 on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Séguin was also responsible for further improvements in locomotive efficiency and played a leading role, again in collaboration with his brother Camille, in the construction of the first French railroad, between Saint-Étienne and Lyon (1824–33). He also made contributions to theoretical physics and wrote engineering treatises on the suspension bridge, the railroad, steam navigation, and steam power.
