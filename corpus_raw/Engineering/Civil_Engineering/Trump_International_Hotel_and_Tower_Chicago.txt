Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago, also called Trump Tower Chicago,  commercial and residential skyscraper located at 401 North Wabash Avenue along the Chicago River, offering condominiums, retail space, parking facilities, and hotel services. Named after real estate developer Donald Trump, the 98-story building was designed by architect Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). It was completed in 2009 and ranks among the tallest residential buildings in the world.
Trump Tower is designed with three setbacks (steplike recessions in the facade of the building), each pointing toward and communicating with an architecturally significant neighbour. The first setback, at 16 stories, corresponds to the cornice of the nearby Wrigley Building; the second setback, at 29 stories, points both north toward River Plaza and west toward Marina City; and at 51 stories the third setback relates to Mies van der Rohe’s last Chicago project, 330 North Wabash Avenue (known as AMA Plaza).
To enable Trump Tower to withstand Chicago’s staunch wind loads, SOM used a concrete structural system often referred to as “core and outrigger construction.” The building has a central core of concrete with concrete arms (outriggers) that reach out across several key floors. The outriggers connect the central core with an exterior ring of structural columns. This method—also used in the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, which was designed by the same SOM engineers—allows for both design flexibility and structural strength.
