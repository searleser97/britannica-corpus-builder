British Railways, byname British Rail,  former national railway system of Great Britain, created by the Transport Act of 1947, which inaugurated public ownership of the railroads. The first railroad built in Great Britain to use steam locomotives was the Stockton and Darlington, opened in 1825. It used a steam locomotive built by George Stephenson and was practical only for hauling minerals. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which opened in 1830, was the first modern railroad. It was a public carrier of both passengers and freight. By 1870 Britain had about 13,500 miles (21,700 km) of railroad. At the system’s greatest extent, in 1914, there were about 20,000 miles (32,000 km) of track, run by 120 competing companies. The British government combined all these companies into four main groups in 1923 as an economy measure.
When World War II began in 1939, Britain’s railroads were placed under government control. The Transport Act of 1947 nationalized the railways, which were taken over by the British Transport Commission (BTC) in 1948 and given the name British Railways. The BTC divided Britain’s rail network into six (later five) regions on a geographic basis. A 1962 law replaced the BTC with the British Railways Board in 1963. The board’s management emphasized mass movement over major trunk lines and the closing of money-losing branch lines and depots.
Between 1963 and 1975 the board shortened its routes from 17,500 miles (28,000 km) to 11,000 miles (17,000 km) and cut personnel from about 475,000 to about 250,000. As part of a modernization program, steam locomotives began to be replaced by diesels in the 1950s, and this was followed in the ’60s by electrification. The board undertook track reconstruction, installed long, continuously welded rails, and introduced new signaling systems. A computerized freight service introduced in 1975 could monitor the movements of more than 200,000 freight cars. In 1966–67 the west-coast line from London to Birmingham, Manchester, and Liverpool was electrified, and in the early 1970s electrification was extended to Glasgow. Track improvements and the High Speed Train (InterCity 125), a diesel train operating at speeds up to 125 miles per hour (200 km per hour), cut travel times between Britain’s major cities.
The British government restructured British Rail in 1993 prior to privatizing the company. Passenger traffic and freight traffic were divided into 25 train-operating units and six freight-operating companies, respectively, that were franchised to private-sector operators. A new state-owned company, Railtrack, was created in 1994 to own and manage the system’s track, signals, land, and stations. Railtrack was privatized in 1996. A cracked rail led to a train derailment at Hatfield in 2000 that killed four people; trains were slowed down throughout the country as rails were checked for cracks. As a result, Railtrack announced losses of 534 million pounds in 2001. The British government formed a new not-for-profit company, Network Rail, Ltd., that assumed Railtrack’s business in 2002.
