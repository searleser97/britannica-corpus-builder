Eduardo Torroja, in full Eduardo Torroja y Miret,  (born Aug. 27, 1899, Madrid, Spain—died June 15, 1961, Madrid), Spanish architect and engineer notable as a pioneer in the design of concrete-shell structures.
Torroja graduated as an engineer in 1923 and began working with a contractor. He became a consulting engineer in 1927. His first concrete-shell structure, a covered market in Algeciras (1933), was followed two years later by two of his most admired shell structures, both in Madrid: the grandstand at the Zarzuela racecourse and the sports hall. The shell roof of the racecourse cantilevers out some 43 feet (13 metres). Double cylindrical shells characterize the sports hall.
Other outstanding works by Torroja include a reservoir in Madrid (1936), the Aldoz aqueduct (1939), the bridge over the Esla at Zamora (1940), hangars at Torrejón de Ardoz (1942), the Las Corts football (soccer) stadium, Barcelona (1943), and the Táchira Club, Caracas (1957). His churches at Xerrallo and Pont de Suert (both 1952) also show his flair for dramatic and graceful form. In 1951 he formed the Technical Institute of Construction and Cement, and he served as its director until his death.
Torroja’s books Philosophy of Structures and The Structures of Eduardo Torroja: An Autobiography of Engineering Accomplishment (both 1958) were influential accounts of his approach to architectural engineering.
