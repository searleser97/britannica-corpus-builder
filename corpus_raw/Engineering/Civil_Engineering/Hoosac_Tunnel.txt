Hoosac Tunnel,   the first major rock tunnel built in the United States. The tunnel runs through Hoosac Mountain of the Berkshire Hills, east of North Adams, Mass., and was built to provide a rail connection between Boston and upper New York state. Though only 4.75 miles (7.6 km) long, the tunnel took 24 years (1851–75) to complete, partly because of slow and laborious rock-tunneling techniques in use when construction began, and partly owing to  financial and political difficulties. Nevertheless, the tunnel, begun under the direction of Herman Haupt and completed by the firm of W. & J. Shanley of Montreal, provided a notable first in civil engineering—the use of nitroglycerin as a blasting agent. This practice was introduced, along with electric firing, by Thomas Doane, the resident engineer. Even more important, the development of compressed-air drilling machinery on the Hoosac helped launch the American pneumatic-tool industry, which assumed immense significance in mining and construction. These innovations greatly accelerated progress in excavating the tunnel, which entered service in 1875.
