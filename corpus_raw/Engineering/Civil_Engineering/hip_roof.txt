Hip roof, also called hipped roof,  roof that slopes upward from all sides of a structure, having no vertical ends. The hip is the external angle at which adjacent sloping sides of a roof meet. The degree of such an angle is referred to as the hip bevel. The triangular sloping surface formed by hips that meet at a roofâ€™s ridge is called a hip end. A pyramidal hipped roof, also known as a pavilion roof, is hipped equally at all corners and the hips meet at a single peak, but the more common form of hip roof is above a rectangular structure, where a roof ridge meets two hips at either end.
A variant is the half-hipped or jerkin head roof, which has gable ends truncated by the eaves of a small hip end (or jerkin head) that descends a short distance from the roof ridge. On an irregularly shaped structure, there may be more than four hips, which then may alternate with valleys to form a hip-and-valley roof.
