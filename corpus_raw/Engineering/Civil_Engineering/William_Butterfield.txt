William Butterfield,  (born Sept. 7, 1814, London, Eng.—died  Feb. 23, 1900, London), British architect who was prominent in the Gothic Revival in England. Sometimes called the Oxford movement’s most original architect, Butterfield introduced an architectural realism that included a clear expression of materials in colourful contrasts of textures and patterns.
Articled first to a Westminster builder, Butterfield later spent three years with a Worcester architect, acquiring a taste for Gothic. In 1843 he became connected with the Cambridge Camden Society (from 1845 the Ecclesiological Society), a High Anglican group who wished ecclesiastical architecture to conform to the Oxford reformers’ liturgy.
Butterfield, who designed nearly 100 churches noted for their liturgical correctness, worked in a highly original, astringent manner using brick and roughly sawed timber. Variegated brick banding and contrasting coloured materials are characteristic of all Butterfield’s works. Interior surfaces were covered with marble and tile to achieve an even richer coloration. Butterfield’s “structural polychromy” became the fashion of the late Victorian period. His most ornate church is All Saints (1849–59), Margaret Street, London. Others include St. Matthias, Stoke Newington, and St. Alban (1859–63), Holborn, in London; All Saints church at Babbacombe (1865–74), Devon; and St. Augustine (1891–92), Bournemouth. His few secular works include Keble College, Oxford, mostly complete by 1876.
