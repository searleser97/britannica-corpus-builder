Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company, byname Milwaukee Road,  U.S. railway operating in central and northern states. It began in 1863 as the Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway Company. It added Chicago to its route and name in 1863, and in 1927 it was incorporated under its present name.
After acquiring many smaller lines, it reached Kansas City, Mo. and Omaha, Neb., by the beginning of the 20th century. It was the first railway to illuminate its passenger trains with electricity (1880) and the first railroad west of Chicago to equip all passenger trains with steam heat. In 1909 it completed a line west across Montana and Idaho to the Pacific coast at Seattle, Wash. The mountainous section of this line was electrified between 1914 and 1918. In 1935 railway’s the first streamlined train, the “Hiawatha,” entered service, but the line plunged into a 10-year period of bankruptcy.
By 1973 the Milwaukee Road operated about 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometres) of main track, but it was losing business to its chief competitor, the newly merged Burlington Northern, and to interstate trucking. In 1977 it again entered bankruptcy proceedings and in 1980 it began selling and abandoning parts of its transcontinental line in order to shrink to a core system serving the Middle West. Intercity passenger service was turned over to the National Railway Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) in 1971, although it continued to operate commuter service between Chicago and its suburbs.
