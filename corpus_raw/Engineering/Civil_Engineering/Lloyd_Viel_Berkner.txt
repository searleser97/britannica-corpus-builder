Lloyd Viel Berkner,  (born Feb. 1, 1905, Milwaukee, Wis., U.S.—died  June 4, 1967, Washington, D.C.), American physicist and engineer who first measured the extent, including height and density, of the ionosphere (ionized layers of the Earth’s atmosphere), leading to a better understanding of radio wave propagation. He later turned his attention to investigating the origin and development of the Earth’s atmosphere. In 1950 the need for data on a worldwide scale led him to propose the International Geophysical Year, a cooperative study of the Earth, which was carried out by the International Council of Scientific Unions while he was president in 1957–59.
In 1963 Berkner, with L.C. Marshall, advanced a theory to describe the way in which the atmospheres of the solar system’s inner planets had evolved.
As a naval officer beginning in 1926, Berkner was also active in the development of radar and navigation systems, naval aircraft electronics engineering, and studies that led to the construction of the Distant Early Warning system (the DEW Line), a chain of radar stations designed to give the United States advance warning in the event of a missile attack across the North Pole. He wrote more than 100 papers and several books, including Rockets and Satellites (1958), Science in Space (1961), and The Scientific Age (1964).
