Lionel Lukin,  (born May 18, 1742, Little Dunmow, Essex, Eng.—died  Feb. 16, 1834, Hythe, Kent), pioneer in the construction of the modern “unsinkable” lifeboat.
While he was working as a London coachbuilder, Lukin began experimenting with a Norwegian yawl in 1784, testing his alterations in the River Thames. In 1785 he patented his method of constructing small boats that would not sink even when filled with water. He used watertight compartments, cork, and other lightweight materials. He also invented a raft for rescuing persons under ice, an adjustable reclining bed for hospital patients, and a rain gauge.
