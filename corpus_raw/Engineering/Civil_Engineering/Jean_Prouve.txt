Jean Prouvé,  (born April 8, 1901, Nancy, France—died  March 23, 1984, Nancy), French engineer and builder known particularly for his contributions to the art and technology of prefabricated metal construction.
Trained as a metalworker, Prouvé owned and operated from 1922 to 1954 a workshop for the manufacture of wrought-iron objects. He emphasized advanced metalworking techniques and was particularly concerned with the design and production of architectural components and furniture. His significant early buildings using metal panels as curtain walls include a clubhouse at Buc Airport (1937–39) and the Maison du Peuple at Clichy, France (1938–39). Prouvé’s commitment to the idea of prefabricated building components is exemplified by his Headquarters of the Federation of Building Industries, Paris (1947–51), and by several experimental houses and a school. His exceptional grasp of building technology resulted in such striking designs as the Meridian Room of the Paris Observatory (1951), the Exhibition Hall at Nanterre, France (1956–58), and the Church of the Sacré-Coeur de Bonnecousse (1959–60), at Mazamet, France. Prouvé pioneered new structural techniques that would permit the efficient and inexpensive construction of buildings with prefabricated components while retaining architectural quality and individuality.
Prouvé taught at the School of Arts and Crafts (Conservatoire National des Arts et Matières) from 1958 to 1971. He was elected a member of the Academy of Architecture in Paris in 1972.
