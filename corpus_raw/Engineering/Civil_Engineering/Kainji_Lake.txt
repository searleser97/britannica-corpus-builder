Kainji Lake,   reservoir on the Niger River, on the border between Niger and Kebbi states, in western Nigeria. It was created in 1968 by the construction of the Kainji Dam and covers an area of 500 square miles (1,300 square km); it is used extensively for fishing and irrigation. The lake completely submerged Foge Island in the Niger River, the town of Bussa, and other riverine settlements; part of the old town of Yelwa (the seat of Yauri emirate) was also permanently flooded. About 50,000 people—mostly Reshe (Gungunci, Gungawa), Busa (Busawa, Bussangi), Kamberi, Nupe, Lopawa, and Laro—were displaced. Most of these remain near the lake in the government’s “Resettlement Villages,” which include the town of New Bussa (22 miles south of the old Bussa), completed in 1966.
Kainji Lake National Park (2,062 square miles [5,341 square km]) contains the Borgu and Zugurma game reserves and is rich in wildlife, including baboons, duikers, hippopotamuses, hyenas, kobs, roans, and warthogs.
Kainji Dam (opened in 1969), the largest of the dams on the Niger, is 215 feet (66 m) high and 1,800 feet (550 m) across and provides electrical power, improved river navigation upstream to Yelwa in Kebbi state, water control of the Niger down to the Kaduna River confluence, and a road across the Niger, as well as waters for irrigation and fishing.
