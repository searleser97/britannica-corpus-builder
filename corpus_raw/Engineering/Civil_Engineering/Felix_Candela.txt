Felix Candela, in full Felix Candela Outeriño,  (born Jan. 27, 1910, Madrid, Spain—died Dec. 7, 1997, Durham, N.C., U.S.), Spanish-born  architect, designer of reinforced-concrete (ferroconcrete) structures distinguished by thin, curved shells that are extremely strong and unusually economical.
Candela emigrated to Mexico in 1939 and began to design and help construct buildings in that country. He attracted international attention in 1950 with his design (in collaboration with Jorge Gonzáles Reyna) for the Cosmic Ray Pavilion, Ciudad Universitaria (the campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Villa Obregón, near Mexico City). The reinforced concrete roof of this pavilion varies in thickness from only 1.6 cm (5/8 inch) to 5 cm (2 inches). Subsequently, Candela built in Mexico City the Church of La Virgen Milagrosa (1953–55; “The Miraculous Virgin”), with a warped roof of reinforced concrete 3.8 cm (1.5 inches) thick, and the Church of San Vicente de Paul (1960). In addition to Rio’s Warehouse in Mexico City (1955) and other warped-shell industrial buildings, he designed various thin-shell catenary, or barrel-vaulted, factories and warehouses. On several of his projects he acted as construction foreman.
His design was chosen for the Sports Palace used in the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. Candela taught in the United States at Harvard University (1961–62) and at the University of Illinois, Chicago (1971–78). After 1971 he resided in the United States and became a citizen in 1978.
