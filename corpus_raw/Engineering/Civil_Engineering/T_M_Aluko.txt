T.M. Aluko, in full Timothy Mofolorunso Aluko,  (born June 14, 1918, Ilesha, Nigeria—died May 1, 2010, Lagos), Nigerian writer whose short stories and novels deal with social change and the clash of cultures in modern Africa.
A civil engineer and town planner by profession, Aluko was educated in Ibadan, Lagos, and London and held positions as director of public works for western Nigeria and faculty member at the University of Lagos. He first became known through his short stories, several of which were awarded British prizes and were broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation African service.
Aluko’s One Man, One Wife (1959), a satirical novel about the conflict of Christian and Yoruba ethics, relates the disillusionment of a village community with the tenets of missionary Christianity. A second novel, One Man, One Matchet (1964), humorously presents the clash of an inexperienced district officer with an unscrupulous politician. Kinsman and Foreman (1966) incorporates Aluko’s professional experiences into a penetrating study of an idealistic young engineer’s battle against the corrupt practices of his highly respected public works foreman, who is also his uncle. Chief the Honourable Minister (1970) satirizes the calamity resulting from a schoolmaster’s appointment as minister of works in a newly independent country. His subsequent novels include His Worshipful Majesty (1973), Wrong Ones in the Dock (1982), and A State of Our Own (1986). The economy of style, graceful prose, and gentle irony of Aluko’s novels brought him critical acclaim. He also published My Years of Service (1994) and The Story of My Life (2006), both volumes of autobiography.
