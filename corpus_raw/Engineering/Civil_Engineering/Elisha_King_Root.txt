Elisha King Root,  (born May 10, 1808, Ludlow, Mass., U.S.—died Aug. 31, 1865, Hartford, Conn.), American inventor, engineer, and manufacturer.
Root worked in a cotton mill from age 10 and later as a machinist. He became superintendent of Samuel Colt’s firearms company in 1849, and he succeeded Colt as president on the latter’s death. In 1853 he designed a drop hammer, which was soon being used in every forge in the world. His numerous inventions and innovations were principally responsible for Colt’s preeminence in small arms.
