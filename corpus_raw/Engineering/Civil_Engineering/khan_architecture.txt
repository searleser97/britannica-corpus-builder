Khan,  type of inn once found in the Middle East and parts of North Africa and Central Asia that effectively functioned as a trading centre and hostel. A square courtyard was surrounded by rows of connected lodging rooms, usually on two levels and arcaded. Although some stable space was provided, the khan was intended primarily for people, providing food as well as shelter for travelers and traders. The earliest extant khans, found in Syria, date to the Umayyad period. In the 16th century, under Ottoman rule, khans became one feature of a larger complex that could include a mosque, a fortress, a bath, and other amenities.
Although khans are often confused with caravansaries (a public building used for sheltering caravans and other travelers), khans were much smaller than caravansaries and were built within towns rather than on the outskirts. Modern motels and motor inns may be considered descendants of the khan and attest to the success of the design, with their easy access to rooms and storage space for transport.
