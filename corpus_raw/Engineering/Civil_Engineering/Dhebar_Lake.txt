Dhebar Lake,  large reservoir lake in the southeastern Aravalli Range, south-central Rajasthan state, northwestern India. The lake, about 20 square miles (50 square km) in area when full, was originally named Jai Samand and was formed by a marble dam built across the Gomati River in the late 17th century. Canals carry water from the lake to villages in the western area. Small wooded islands dot the northern end of the lake, where fishing hamlets fringe the shore. Two palaces stand on the hills to the south.
