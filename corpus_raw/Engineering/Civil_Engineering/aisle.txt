Aisle,   portion of a church or basilica that parallels or encircles the major sections of the structure, such as the nave, choir, or apse (aisles around the apse are usually called ambulatories). The aisle is often set off by columns or by an arcade.
The name derives from the French for “wing,” because in Romanesque architecture the aisles flanked only the nave and were often covered by roofs of lower height, thus forming wings. Although the aisle area may be used for seating, especially in more recent times, it was originally intended as a path to seats or to the front of the church. Today, the word also refers to any passageway that gives access to seating in a church, theatre, or other public structure.
