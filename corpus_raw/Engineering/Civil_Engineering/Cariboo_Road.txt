Cariboo Road,   wagon trail that was constructed (1862â€“65) in the Fraser River valley, in southern British Columbia, Canada, to serve the Cariboo gold rush. The trail extended more than 400 miles (644 km) from Yale, at the head of steamboat navigation on the Fraser River, through Ashcroft, to Barkerville in the Cariboo Mountains. The project was regarded as an engineering triumph because of the precipitous terrain. The original road, which facilitated settlement of the area, has been replaced by a modern highway that is called Cariboo Highway along part of its extent.
