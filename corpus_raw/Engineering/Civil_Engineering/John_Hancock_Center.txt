John Hancock Center,  100-story mixed-use skyscraper, located at 875 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago and named after one of its early developers and tenants, the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. The architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill was responsible for the design of the tower, with Bruce Graham serving as architect and Fazlur Khan as structural engineer—the same team that built Chicago’s tallest building, the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower). The John Hancock Center was completed in 1970, and its gently sloping black steel form remains one of the most-recognizable structures in Chicago’s famed skyline.
A bold form was chosen for the Hancock Center. The tapered rectangular tube—with giant trusses on each of the four sides—readily shows how the building is supported. The X-bracing on the building’s exterior enables it to resist wind loads while reducing the need for internal support columns, greatly increasing available floor space.
The original plan called for two buildings to be built on the site. But the private Casino Club just east of the site refused to sell its lot to the developers. A smaller site meant a tight squeeze and an area incapable of housing two planned structures. A trussed single tower was deemed the most cost-effective alternative.
The building includes a mix of residential apartments, a parking garage, and retail and office space, with lounging, dining, and observatory facilities on the 94th, 95th, and 96th floors. The building’s plaza, part of which is below street level and complete with garden and waterfall, is a popular urban oasis for tourists.
