Carl von Linde,  (born June 11, 1842, Berndorf, Bavaria [Germany]—died  Nov. 16, 1934, Munich, Ger.), German engineer whose invention of a continuous process of liquefying gases in large quantities formed a basis for the modern technology of refrigeration and provided both impetus and means for conducting scientific research at low temperatures and very high vacuums.
While an assistant professor of machine design at the newly established Technische Hochschule in Munich from 1868, he developed a methyl ether refrigerator (1874) and an ammonia refrigerator (1876). Though other refrigeration units had been developed earlier, Linde’s were the first to be designed with the aim of precise calculations of efficiency.
In 1895 he set up a large-scale plant for the production of liquid air. Six years later he developed a method for separating pure liquid oxygen from liquid air that resulted in widespread industrial conversion to processes utilizing oxygen (e.g., in steel manufacture).
