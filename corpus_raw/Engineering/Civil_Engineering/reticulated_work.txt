Reticulated work, also called opus reticulatum,  type of facing used on ancient Roman concrete or mortared rubblework walls. It appeared during the late Roman Republic and became widespread by the reign of Augustus. It succeeded the earliest type of facing, an irregular patchwork called opus incertum. Reticulated work looks like a diagonal checkerboard with its square stones set lozenge fashion, separated by relatively fine joints. The stones are about 4 inches (10 cm) square and extend into the wall for 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm). The name is derived from the Latin rēte, “net,” because the wall surface had the appearance of a fishing net.
Examples of opus reticulatum may be seen at Ostia, in the Piazzale of the Corporations where tufa reticulate masonry forms the wall of a Roman guild office; at Rome in the wall of the Mausoleum of Augustus; and on the terraces of the country villa built by Herod the Great (d. 4 bc) at Jericho, Jordan. Reticulated work was replaced by a type of brick wall-facing called opus testaceum, which became the most common method in the imperial era.
