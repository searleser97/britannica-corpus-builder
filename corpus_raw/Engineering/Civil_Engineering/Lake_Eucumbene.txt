Lake Eucumbene,  one of Australiaâ€™s largest reservoirs (capacity 3,890,000 acre-feet [4,798,000,000 cubic m], surface area 56 square miles [145 square km]), the major storage facility of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme, in the Eastern Highlands, New South Wales, 55 miles (88 km) southwest of Canberra. Its dam (completed 1958), fed by the Eucumbene (see photograph), Upper Murrumbidgee, and Snowy rivers, is 381 feet (116 m) high. The river waters are conveyed to and from the lake by means of pressure tunnels and are regulated to serve the Tumut and Murray electric power stations. The lake has also been developed as a tourist and fishing centre.
