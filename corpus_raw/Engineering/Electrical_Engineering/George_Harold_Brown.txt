George Harold Brown,  (born Oct. 14, 1908, North Milwaukee, Wis., U.S.—died  Dec. 11, 1987, Princeton, N.J.), American electrical engineer who made major contributions to the development of radio and television broadcast antennas.
After completing his education at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (B.S., 1930; M.S., 1931; Ph.D., 1933), Brown joined the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1933 as a research engineer. Advancing steadily, he was elected an executive vice president of RCA in 1965.
In 1934–36 Brown developed broadcast antennas that could transmit electromagnetic waves in a desired direction. His calculations, published in 1937, became the standard reference used by broadcast engineers to set up arrays of directional antennas. In 1936 he invented the “turnstile” antenna, which became the standard for television and frequency-modulated (FM) radio broadcasting. Two years later, he devised the vestigial side-band filter for television transmitters, a component that doubled television’s horizontal resolution (ability to render distinguishable objects that are close together in a picture). During World War II, he worked on military problems for the U.S. government and in subsequent years turned his attention to ultrahigh-frequency television transmission.
