Sir William Henry Preece,  (born Feb. 15, 1834, Bryn Helen, Caernarvon, Wales—died  Nov. 6, 1913, Penrhos, Caernarvon), Welsh electrical engineer who was a major figure in the development and introduction of wireless telegraphy and the telephone in Great Britain.
His graduate studies at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, London, under Michael Faraday aroused Preece’s interest in applied electricity and telegraphic engineering. For 29 years, from 1870, he was an engineer with the Post Office telegraphic system and contributed many inventions and improvements, including a railroad signaling system that increased railway safety. An early pioneer in wireless telegraphy, he originated his own system in 1892, but his most important contribution in this field was his encouragement of Guglielmo Marconi by obtaining assistance from the Post Office in furthering Marconi’s work. Preece also introduced into Great Britain the first telephones, patented by Alexander Graham Bell. Preece was knighted in 1899.
