Oskar von Miller,  (born May 7, 1855, Munich [Germany]—died  April 9, 1934, Munich), electrical engineer who fostered the electric-power industry in Germany and founded the Deutsches Museum of science and technology in Munich.
Miller studied at the Munich Technical Institute and organized the Munich Electrical Exposition of 1882, the first ever held in Germany. There he demonstrated the transmission of electrical energy over a wire 35 miles (57 km) long. In 1883 he founded the German Edison Company with Emil Rathenau; this company, which in 1887 was renamed Allgemeine Elektricitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), was largely responsible for installing Germany’s first electrical system. Miller himself designed Berlin’s first central power station. In 1891, while technical director of the Frankfurt Electrical Exposition, he captured world attention by building a cable that transmitted alternating current at 25,000 volts over a distance of 112 miles (180 km). His interest in the conversion of water power to electrical energy led to the development of hydroelectric stations in Bavaria.
In 1903 Miller proposed the construction of a museum that would not only preserve technological artifacts but also teach visitors scientific principles through the use of operating devices and dioramas. The resulting teaching museum, the first of its kind, became the model for science museums throughout the world.
