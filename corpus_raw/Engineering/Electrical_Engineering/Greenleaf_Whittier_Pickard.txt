Greenleaf Whittier Pickard,  (born Feb. 14, 1877, Portland, Maine, U.S.—died  Jan. 8, 1956, Newton, Mass.), U.S. electrical engineer who invented the crystal detector (one of the first devices widely used for receiving radio broadcasts) and who was also one of the first scientists to demonstrate the wireless electromagnetic transmission of speech.
Pickard, who was a grandnephew of the poet John Greenleaf Whittier, was educated at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge. In 1899, at the Blue Hills Observatory in Milton, Mass., he transmitted spoken messages by radio over a distance of 10 miles, using a carbon-steel detector to recover the audible signal that had been impressed on the radio-frequency carrier waves. As an engineer at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (1902–06), he contributed to the development of the radiophone; from 1907 until 1930 he worked with the Wireless Specialty Apparatus Co., and after 1945 he headed the electronics engineering firm of Pickard and Burns.
Pickard is best known for discovering that the contact between a fine metallic wire (“cat whisker”) and the surface of certain crystalline materials (notably silicon) rectifies and demodulates high-frequency alternating currents, such as those produced in a receiving antenna by radio waves. This device, called a crystal detector and patented by Pickard in 1906, was an essential component of the crystal set, a form of radio receiver that was popular until the crystal detector was superseded by the triode vacuum tube. (The point-contact rectifier was the forerunner of the transistor, invented in 1948.)
