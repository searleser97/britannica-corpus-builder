William D. Coolidge, in full William David Coolidge,  (born October 23, 1873, Hudson, Massachusetts, U.S.—died February 3, 1975, Schenectady, New York), American engineer and physical chemist whose improvement of tungsten filaments was essential in the development of the modern incandescent lamp bulb and the X-ray tube.
After teaching at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge; 1897, 1901–05) and the University of Leipzig (1899), in 1905 he joined the General Electric (GE) Research Laboratory. By 1908 he had perfected a process to render tungsten ductile and therefore more suitable for incandescent lightbulbs; ductile drawn-tungsten filaments have since been a part of modern lighting.
In 1916 Coolidge patented a revolutionary X-ray tube capable of producing highly predictable amounts of radiation. The Coolidge tube became the prototype of the modern X-ray tube.
During World War I Coolidge worked on the construction of 1,000,000- and 2,000,000-volt X-ray machines for cancer treatment and also for industrial quality control. In collaboration with Irving Langmuir, he also developed the first successful submarine-detection system.
In 1932 Coolidge became director of the GE Research Laboratory. In 1940 he was appointed vice president and director of research for GE. Although he retired in 1944, he remained a consultant and director emeritus.
