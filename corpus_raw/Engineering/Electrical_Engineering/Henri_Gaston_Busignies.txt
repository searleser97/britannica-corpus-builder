Henri-Gaston Busignies,  (born December 29, 1905, Sceaux, France—died  June 20, 1981, Antibes), French-born American electronics engineer whose contribution to the development of high-frequency direction finders (HF/DF, or “Huff Duff”) permitted the U.S. Navy during World War II to detect enemy transmissions.
In 1926 Busignies received a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Paris and began his career by inventing the airborne radio compass, which permitted accurate aircraft navigation. He joined the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (now the ITT Corporation) in 1928 and continued work on his first crude radio compass and radio direction finders. He and other ITT scientists left France for the United States in 1940. In 1941 Busignies’ work for the U.S. Navy resulted in the development of a high-frequency direction-finding system, which was installed throughout the world during the war; later versions were carried on U.S. aircraft, on ships, and by military vehicles. After the war, he participated in the development of moving-target indication (MTI) radar, which allows detection of a moving object, such as an aircraft, when its echo is masked by large, unwanted echoes from land or sea clutter. Busignies retired from ITT in 1975 as a senior vice president.
