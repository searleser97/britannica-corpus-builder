Simon Ramo,  (born May 7, 1913, Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.—died June 27, 2016, Santa Monica, California), American engineer who made notable contributions to electronics and was chief scientist (1954–58) of the U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program.
Ramo graduated (1933) from the University of Utah and earned (1936) a Ph.D. in both physics and electrical engineering from Caltech. For the next 10 years he worked for the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York, developing microwave transmission and detection equipment and General Electric’s electron microscope. In 1946 he accepted a position with Hughes Aircraft Company, Culver City, California, where he advanced fire-control, radar, navigation, computer, and other aircraft-electronics systems. He also directed the development of the Falcon family of air-to-air guided missiles, which were used in the Korean War and became the major weapon on many fighter aircraft.
Ramo and fellow engineer Dean E. Wooldridge left Hughes Aircraft in 1953 to form the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, obtaining financial support from Thompson Products, Inc. (a manufacturer of parts for aircraft engines). Ramo-Wooldridge had the primary responsibility for developing the Atlas, Titan, and Minuteman ICBMs as well as other missiles that were widely used in the late 1950s and ’60s for defense, research, and exploratory probes into space. In 1958 Ramo-Wooldridge merged with Thompson Products to form Thompson Ramo-Wooldridge, Inc., a name later shortened to TRW Inc. Ramo served in a leading capacity at TRW even after his official retirement in 1978.
In addition to technical works such as Fields and Waves in Modern Radio (1944), Introduction to Microwaves (1945), and The Management of Innovative Technological Corporations (1980), Ramo’s writings include such studies of the relationship between science and society, notably Cure for Chaos (1969) and America’s Technology Slip (1980). Ramo was a 1979 recipient of the National Medal of Science and in 1980 was awarded the Founders Medal of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1983.
