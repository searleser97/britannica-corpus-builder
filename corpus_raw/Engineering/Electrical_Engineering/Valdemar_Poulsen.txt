Valdemar Poulsen,  (born November 23, 1869, Copenhagen, Denmark—died July 1942, Copenhagen), Danish engineer who in 1903 developed the first device for generating continuous radio waves, thus aiding the development of radio broadcasting.
After his education Poulsen joined the Copenhagen Telephone Company as an assistant in the technical section. While working there, he invented the telegraphone, an electromagnetic phonograph capable of registering human speech by the alternating magnetization of a wire. He applied for a patent on this device, a forerunner of the modern magnetic sound recorder, in 1898. A working model created great interest at the Paris Exposition in 1900. Even with this encouragement, he could not find financial backers in Europe. In 1903, with American associates, he founded the American Telegraphone Company for the manufacture and sale of an improved version of his device. The telegraphone recorded continuously for 30 minutes on a length of steel piano-wire moving at a speed of 84 inches (213 cm) per second. The device did not have wide application, however.
Also in 1903 Poulsen obtained an English patent on his adaptation of a “singing arc” for radio purposes. Invented by the Englishman W. Duddell, the singing arc could generate continuous audio waves (hence its name). Poulsen transformed this device so that it could generate radio waves; the arc was formed between a copper cathode (positive terminal) and a carbon anode (negative terminal) in an atmosphere of a hydrocarbon gas and a transverse magnetic field. Subsequent efforts with this device by Poulsen and others made long-wave radio broadcasting possible by 1920.
