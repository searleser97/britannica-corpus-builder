Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti,  (born April 9, 1864, Liverpool, Eng.—died  Jan. 13, 1930, Zürich, Switz.), British electrical engineer who promoted the installation of large electrical generating stations and alternating-current distribution networks in England.
After attending St. Augustine’s College, Ramsgate, Ferranti assisted Sir William Siemens in experiments with electric furnaces and dynamos. By the age of 18 he patented an alternator that was later found to have been anticipated by Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin). The device was noted for its compactness and for its capacity to produce five times more power than any other machine of its size.
In 1886 Ferranti was appointed engineer for the Grosvenor Gallery Electric Supply Corporation, which under his direction grew into one of the world’s largest generating companies. In 1887, promoting the location of power stations away from the centres of cities, he designed the Deptford Power Station outside London. The largest station of its time, it developed an electric potential of 10,000 volts—four times greater than previously practical. As chief electrician of the London Electric Supply Corporation at Deptford, Ferranti was among the first to advocate the use of large-scale electricity-generating stations and the use of electricity for lighting, heating, motor power, and other services. He correctly anticipated the modern “grid” system of electrical power distribution and consumption. Ferranti also advocated the use of alternating current—later adopted universally—as opposed to the supply of direct current proposed by Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton.
