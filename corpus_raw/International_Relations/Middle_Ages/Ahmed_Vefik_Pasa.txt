Ahmed Vefik Paşa,   (born July 6, 1823, Constantinople [now Istanbul]—died  April 2, 1891, Constantinople), Ottoman statesman and scholar who presided over the first Ottoman Parliament (1877) and who is known for his contributions to Turkish studies.
Born into a family of diplomats, Ahmed Vefik was appointed (1849) imperial commissioner in the Danubian principalities and later ambassador to Persia and to France. He presided over the first Turkish Parliament (1877) and was twice appointed grand vizier (chief minister) for brief periods in 1878 and 1882. In 1879 he became the vali (governor) of Bursa, where he sponsored important reforms in sanitation, education, and agriculture and established the first Ottoman theatre.
Ahmed Vefik spent his leisure translating Molière’s plays and compiling Turkish dictionaries and historical and geographical manuals. He edited the first Salnâme (“Year Book”) of the Ottoman Empire (1847), and in 1876 he published Lehƈe-i Osmanî (“Language of the Ottomans”), a concise dictionary that emphasized pure Turkish and formed a basis for the works of other Turkish scholars.
After December 1882 he was confined, on Sultan Abdülhamid II’s order, to his house at Rumeli Hisar on the Bosporus. His library was sold for the payment of his debts.
