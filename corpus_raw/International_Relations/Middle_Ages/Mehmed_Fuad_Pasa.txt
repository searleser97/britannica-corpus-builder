Mehmed Fuad Paşa,  (born 1815, Constantinople [now Istanbul]—died  Feb. 12, 1869, Nice, Fr.), Turkish statesman of the mid-19th century and one of the chief architects of the Tanzimat (Reorganization), aimed at the modernization and westernization of the Ottoman Empire.
The son of a well-known Turkish poet, Fuad Paşa was trained in medicine, but his knowledge of French allowed him to enter the diplomatic service, where he became the first secretary of the Turkish Embassy in London (1840). After holding several diplomatic posts, he served as minister of foreign affairs under Âli Paşa (1852–53) and again in 1855–56.
A confirmed westernizer, Fuad Paşa served on the Commission of Education, which recommended a complete reform of the school system. He assumed the presidency of the Tanzimat Council in 1857. After the accession of Sultan Abdülaziz (1861), Fuad Paşa became grand vizier and foreign minister, and, although dismissed in 1862, he returned to office in 1863. He held the grand viziership until 1867.
A scholar as well as a statesman, he collaborated with the historian Ahmed Cevdet in writing Kavaid-i Osmaniye (1851; “The Rules of Ottoman Turkish”), the first Turkish work on Turkish grammar published in the empire and a milestone in the reform of the language.
