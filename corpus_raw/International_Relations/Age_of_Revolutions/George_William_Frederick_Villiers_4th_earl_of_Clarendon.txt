George William Frederick Villiers, 4th earl of Clarendon,   (born Jan. 12, 1800, London—died  June 27, 1870, London), British foreign secretary under four prime ministers at various times from 1853, including the Crimean War period; he was known as “the great Lord Clarendon.”
After serving as a customs commissioner in Dublin and Paris, Villiers was British ambassador to Spain in 1833. Inheriting the earldom of Clarendon in 1838, he returned to England the next year and served as lord privy seal (1839–41) and then as president of the Board of Trade (1846–47). As lord lieutenant (viceroy) of Ireland (1847–52) during the disastrous Irish famine, he resorted to coercive legislation to prevent a general outbreak of violence and sponsored ineffective relief projects. His agrarian reform measures only encouraged English speculation in Irish land.
In February 1853 Clarendon became secretary of state for foreign affairs in the 4th Earl of Aberdeen’s ministry, just before the outbreak of the Crimean War against Russia. His attempts to prevent the war were unsuccessful, and his performance during the war undistinguished; but, acting for Lord Palmerston, who became prime minister in 1855, he did manage to secure favourable terms for Britain at the Congress of Paris in 1856.
Having left office with Palmerston in 1858, Clarendon served twice more as foreign secretary: under Lord John Russell (1865–66) and under William Ewart Gladstone (1868–70). On two occasions he refused a marquessate and the governor-generalship of India. Three weeks before the outbreak of the Franco-German War, he died while trying to induce Prussia to accept reduction of armaments.
