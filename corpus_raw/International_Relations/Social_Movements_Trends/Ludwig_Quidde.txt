Ludwig Quidde,  (born March 23, 1858, Bremen, Ger.—died  March 5, 1941, Geneva, Switz.), historian, politician, and one of the most prominent German pacifists of the early 20th century. He was the cowinner (with Ferdinand-Édouard Buisson) of the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1927.
During 1889–96 he was editor of the Deutsche Zeitschrift für Geschichtswissenschaft and in 1890 became professor and secretary of the Prussian Historical Institute in Rome. In 1892 he returned to Munich and joined the German Peace Society. In 1894 he published a pamphlet, Caligula, which had the appearance of a historical study but was actually a caustic satire on the German emperor William II; the enormously popular publication brought Quidde three months’ imprisonment for lese majesty. From 1907 to 1919 Quidde was a liberal member of the Bavarian Landtag (Assembly) and member of the Interparliamentary Union. From 1914 to 1929 he served as chairman of the German Peace Society. During World War I he opposed German sentiments for the annexation of foreign territories as a condition for a peace settlement.
In 1919 he joined the Democratic Party and during 1919–20 served as a member of the National Assembly, where he fought for a proportional electoral system and denounced the German war-guilt clause of the Treaty of Versailles. He was chairman of the German Peace Cartel, 1921–29, representing the right wing of pacifism. Quidde supported the Weimar Republic, advocated Germany’s admittance to the League of Nations, and opposed the revival and growth of German militarism. Quidde was arrested in 1924 in Munich after writing in Welt am Montag against illegal military training by the German armed forces. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Quidde immigrated to Geneva, where he remained in exile for the rest of his life. He published several books on historical and political topics, including some on pacifist subjects.
