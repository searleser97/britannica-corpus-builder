Jody Williams,  (born October 9, 1950, Putney, Vermont, U.S.), American activist who helped found the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL). In 1997 she and the campaign were named corecipients of the Nobel Prize for Peace.
In 1984 Williams received a master’s degree from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C. She was a co-coordinator of the Nicaragua-Honduras Education Project (1984–86) and deputy director of Medical Aid for El Salvador (1986–92). In October 1992, with the cooperation of six international organizations, she coordinated the launch of the ICBL with the mission of abolishing the use of antipersonnel land mines. Her efforts bore fruit in December 1997, when the Mine Ban Treaty was signed by more than 100 countries in Ottawa. During the following decade, about 130 countries ratified the treaty—with the exception of the major mine-producing ones, such as the United States, Russia, and China.
Williams lectured widely on the dangers of land mines, publicizing the presence of tens of millions of unexploded land mines in more than 70 countries. She was coauthor of After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines (1995), which examines the socioeconomic impact of land-mine contamination in four countries, and coeditor of Banning Landmines: Disarmament, Citizen Diplomacy, and Human Security (2008). In 2007 she was appointed to lead a United Nations High-Level Mission to investigate human rights abuses in the war-torn Sudanese region of Darfur. In the same year, she joined the faculty of the University of Houston’s Graduate College of Social Work as a professor of peace and social justice. She received more than a dozen honorary degrees and was named by Forbes magazine in 2004 as one of the 100 most powerful women in the world. Her memoir, My Name Is Jody Williams: A Vermont Girl’s Winding Path to the Nobel Peace Prize, was published in 2013.
