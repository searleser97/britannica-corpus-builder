Hans Christoph, baron von Gagern,  (born Jan. 25, 1766, Kleinniedesheim, near Worms [Germany]—died Oct. 22, 1852, Hornau, near Höchst), conservative German administrator, patriotic politician, and writer who unsuccessfully called for arming the entire German nation during the French Revolutionary Wars. He represented the Netherlands at the Congress of Vienna (1814–15) and favoured restoring the Holy Roman Empire to protect Germany’s smaller principalities from the two large states, Austria and Prussia.
Educated at Leipzig and Göttingen, Gagern entered the Nassau-Weilburg administration (1786), rising rapidly to chief minister. As Nassau’s envoy to Paris, he secured (1806) additional territories for his principality within the Confederation of the Rhine, the league of German princes sponsored by Napoleon. After leaving the Nassau administration in 1811, he became foreign policy adviser to the Austrian archduke John. In 1813 the Prussian minister, Karl, Freiherr vom Stein, appointed Gagern to the administrative council for the reconquered Prussian lands in western Germany, and in 1814 he became administrator of the Orange principalities. As the Netherlands’ envoy at the Congress of Vienna, Gagern failed in his attempts to tie these territories closer to Germany and to restore the old Holy Roman Empire (dissolved in 1806). After the Battle of Waterloo (1815) he unsuccessfully championed the return of Alsace to Germany. Always an advocate of the rights of small states, Gagern was the representative of the Orange principality of Luxembourg at the German Bundestag (diet) from 1816 to 1818. In 1820 he was elected to the lower house of Hesse-Darmstadt, and in 1829 he became a lifelong member of that state’s upper house.
