Betty Williams, byname of Elizabeth Williams,  (born May 22, 1943, Belfast, Northern Ireland—died March 17, 2020, Belfast), Northern Irish peace activist who, with Máiread Maguire and Ciaran McKeown, founded the Peace People, a grassroots movement dedicated to ending the sectarian strife in Northern Ireland. For her work, Williams shared with Maguire the 1976 Nobel Prize for Peace.
Williams, an office worker and wife and mother, took little part in public life until August 1976, when she witnessed an incident that moved her to speak out. An Irish Republican Army terrorist was shot by British troops while fleeing in a car, and the car went out of control and struck several people, killing three children. Williams immediately began circulating petitions in Protestant neighbourhoods calling for an end to sectarian violence. This activity soon brought her into association with Maguire (then Máiread Corrigan), an aunt of the slain children, who had been similarly galvanized into action. Together they founded the Peace People to advocate for an end to the Northern Ireland conflict.
Williams left the Peace People organization in the early 1980s. Soon afterward she immigrated to the United States, where she resided for two decades before moving to the Republic of Ireland. Williams founded the World Centers of Compassion for Children International in 1997. In 2006 she joined Maguire and fellow Nobel Peace Prize winners Shirin Ebadi, Jody Williams, Wangari Maathai, and Rigoberta Menchú to found the Nobel Women’s Initiative.
