Sir Randal Cremer, in full Sir William Randal Cremer,  (born March 18, 1838, Fareham, Hampshire, England—died July 22, 1908, London), British trade unionist and pacifist who won the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1903 for his advocacy of international arbitration.
In 1860 Cremer was one of the founders of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners. He was secretary of the British section of the International Working Men’s Association (First International) but resigned because of a dispute with another leader. During the Franco-German War (1870–71) he formed a workingmen’s committee to advocate British neutrality. This group developed into the Workmen’s Peace Association, of which Cremer was secretary until his death. Cremer was a member of the House of Commons from 1885 to 1895 and from 1900 to 1908. He was knighted in 1907.
