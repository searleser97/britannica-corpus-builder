George Blake, original name Georg Behar,  (born November 11, 1922, Rotterdam, Netherlands—died December 26, 2020, Moscow, Russia), British diplomat and spy for the Soviet Union.
After escaping from the Netherlands at the beginning of World War II, Blake served in the Royal Navy until 1948, when he entered the Foreign Office and was appointed vice-consul in Seoul. Blake was interned (1950–53) after North Korean troops captured Seoul, and he secretly became a communist. After his repatriation (1953) he was assigned to the British military government in Berlin (1955), where he had access to information of the British secret service. Recalled in 1959, he worked for the intelligence branch of the Foreign Office (MI-6) and then was sent to the Middle East College for Arabic Studies, Lebanon (1960). After his arrest in April 1961, he admitted being a double agent, having given every important document that had come into his possession since 1953 to his Soviet contact and having betrayed many British agents (at least 42 by his captors’ account, some 600 by his own account). Sentenced to 42 years in prison in May 1961, he escaped from Wormwood Scrubs Prison in October 1966 and fled to the Soviet Union.
It was later discovered that Blake was aided in his escape by two peace activists and by his cell mate, Sean Bourke, who revealed his role in the escape in his book The Springing of George Blake (1970). Blake’s autobiography, No Other Choice, was published in 1990. After the British government seized £90,000 in payments from his publisher, Blake filed suit and was awarded £5,000 in compensation in 2006. That same year he published a memoir, Transparent Walls. In 2007 he was awarded the Order of Friendship by Pres. Vladimir Putin of Russia.
