Diodorus Cronus,  (born 4th century bc), philosopher of the Megarian school, remembered for his innovations in logic. His surname Cronus, of uncertain meaning, was applied both to him and to his teacher, the philosopher Apollonius of Cyrene. Through Apollonius he is linked with Eubulides of Miletus, a 4th-century Greek thinker; together the three men formed the branch of the Megarian school that was especially strong in formal logic. The 3rd-century-ad historian Diogenes Laërtius reported that, at the court of Ptolemy Soter, Diodorus could not solve a logical problem propounded by Stilpon and died of shame at his failure (c. 307). None of Diodorus’ writings are extant.
