Simplicius Of Cilicia,   (flourished c. 530), Greek philosopher whose learned commentaries on Aristotle’s De caelo (“On the Heavens”), Physics, De anima (“On the Soul”), and Categories are considered important, both for their original content and for the fact that they contain many valuable fragments of pre-Socratic philosophers. Simplicius studied at Athens and at Alexandria and spent most of his life in Athens, except for a short period after the closing of the school of philosophy in 529. A commentary on the Encheiridion of Epictetus and a work on quadratures are extant.
