Leopold Kronecker,  (born December 7, 1823, Liegnitz, Prussia [now Legnica, Poland]—died December 29, 1891, Berlin, Germany), German mathematician whose primary contributions were in the theory of equations and higher algebra.
Kronecker acquired a passion for number theory from Ernst Kummer, his instructor in mathematics at the Liegnitz Gymnasium, and earned his doctor’s degree at the University of Berlin with a dissertation (1845) on those special complex units that appear in certain algebraic number fields. He managed the family mercantile and land business until age 30, when he was financially able to retire. While in business he pursued mathematics as a recreation. From 1861 to 1883 Kronecker lectured at the University of Berlin, and in 1883 he succeeded Kummer as professor there.
Kronecker was primarily an arithmetician and algebraist. His major contributions were in elliptic functions, the theory of algebraic equations, and the theory of algebraic numbers. In the last field he created an alternative to the theory of his fellow countryman Julius Dedekind. Kronecker’s theory of algebraic magnitudes (1882) presents a part of this theory; his philosophy of mathematics, however, seems destined to outlast his more technical contributions. He was the first to doubt the significance of nonconstructive existence proofs (proofs that show something must exist, often by using a proof through contradiction, but that give no method of producing them), and for many years he carried on a polemic against the analytic school of the German mathematician Karl Weierstrass concerning these proofs and other points of classical analysis. Kronecker joined Weierstrass in approving the universal arithmetization of analysis, but he insisted that all mathematics should be reduced to the positive whole numbers.
