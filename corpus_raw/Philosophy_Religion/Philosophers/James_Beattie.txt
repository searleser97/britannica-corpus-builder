James Beattie,  (born November 5, 1735, Laurencekirk, Kincardine, Scotland—died August 18, 1803, Aberdeen), Scottish poet and essayist, whose once-popular poem The Minstrel was one of the earliest works of the Romantic movement.
Beattie was a farmer’s son. He graduated from Marischal College, Aberdeen, and became professor of moral philosophy there. At the age of 25, he published Original Poems and Translations (1760), which already showed a Romantic attitude toward nature. With his Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, in Opposition to Sophistry and Scepticism (1770), a vigorous defense of orthodoxy against the rationalism of David Hume, he achieved fame. Addressed to the layman, the essay is based on social rather than metaphysical arguments and enjoyed wide popularity. The next year he published the first part of The Minstrel, a poem in the Spenserian stanza tracing the development of a poet’s mind under the influence of nature. The second part was published in 1774. Although the setting is artificial and the moralizing tedious, the poem reflects the author’s gentleness and sensitivity to natural beauty. To his generation it was a revelation, and it influenced Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott, and Lord Byron. This double success, as the defender of Christianity and the poet of a new era, opened all doors. Beattie was welcomed into Samuel Johnson’s circle, sat for his portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and was given a life pension by George III. Success brought little happiness. His wife became insane and his sons, one of whom was a promising poet, died young. Beattie, who published the elder son’s writings with a memoir in 1794 (Essays and Fragments in Prose and Verse), was overwhelmed by the death of the younger son and never recovered his health.
