Johann August Eberhard,  (born Aug. 31, 1739, Halberstadt, Brandenburg [Germany]—died  Jan. 6, 1809, Halle, Westphalia), German philosopher and lexicographer who defended the views of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz against those of Immanuel Kant and compiled a dictionary of the German language that remained in use for a century.
After studying theology at the University of Halle, Eberhard became a Lutheran preacher in 1763 at Halberstadt. In 1774 he was a pastor at Charlottenburg but gradually became estranged from orthodox Lutheranism through the influence of the German-Jewish thinker Moses Mendelssohn and the German writer C.F. Nicolai, an opponent of Kant. Consequently, in his Neue Apologie des Socrates (1772–78; “A New Apology for Socrates”) and in his Allgemeine Theorie des Denkens und Empfindens (1776; “General Theory of Thinking and Feeling”), Eberhard advocated the free examination of religious doctrine and epistemological rationalism in the manner of Leibniz and the German thinker Christian Wolff. Kant’s critical philosophy appeared to him superfluous in view of what Leibniz and Wolff had already achieved.
In 1778 Eberhard was named professor of theology at Halle by King Frederick II of Prussia. Eight years later he became a member of the Berlin Academy and in 1805 was appointed a privy counselor. His German dictionary, 6 vol. (1795–1802), was reissued in an abridged form as Synonymisches Handwörterbuch der deutschen Sprache (1802; “Dictionary of Synonyms in the German Language”) and was republished in its 17th edition in 1910 with English, French, Italian, and Russian equivalents.
Opposed to abstract philosophical speculation, Eberhard preferred empirical studies in fields including aesthetics and ethics. Among his later works are Theorie der schönen Künste und Wissenschaften (1783; “Theory of the Fine Arts and Sciences”), Allgemeine Geschichte der Philosophie (1788; “General History of Philosophy”), and Handbuch der Aesthetik (1803–05).
