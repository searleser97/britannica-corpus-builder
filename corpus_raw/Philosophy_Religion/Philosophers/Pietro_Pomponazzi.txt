Pietro Pomponazzi,  (born Sept. 16, 1462, Mantua, Marquisate of Mantua—died  May 18, 1525, Bologna), philosopher and leading representative of Renaissance Aristotelianism, which had developed at Italian universities after the close of the 13th century.
Pomponazzi was educated in philosophy and medicine at the University of Padua, and he taught philosophy there intermittently from 1487 to 1509. He also taught at Ferrara and at Bologna until his death. Thoroughly versed in Aristotle and his commentators, particularly Thomas Aquinas and Averroës, Pomponazzi interpreted Aristotle in the light of the Humanism of his own time. His treatise on the immortality of the soul, Tractatus de immortalitate animae (1516), was attacked but not officially condemned; and he was allowed to publish a defense of his position in his Apologia (1518) and Defensorium (1519).
He contended that the immortality of the individual soul cannot be demonstrated on the basis of Aristotle or of reason, but must be accepted as an article of faith. In developing this view, he maintained that moral action is the only proper goal of human life. Appealing to the Stoic philosophers, rather than to Aristotle, he declared that virtue is its own reward and vice its own punishment. In Pomponazzi’s typically Humanist view, man’s special dignity consists in his moral virtue. A master of the Scholastic treatise, which formulates objections to its thesis and proceeds to overcome them, Pomponazzi was also the author of the lengthy treatises De incantationibus (1556; “On Incantations”), which proposed a natural explanation of several reputedly miraculous phenomena, and De fato (1567; “On Fate”), which discusses predestination and free will.
