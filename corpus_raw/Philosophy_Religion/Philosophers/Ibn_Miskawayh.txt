Ibn Miskawayh, in full Abū ʿAlī Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Yaʿqūb ibn Miskawayh,  (born c. 930—died  1030, Rayy, Iran), Persian scientist, philosopher, and historian whose scholarly works became models for later generations of Islamic thinkers.
Little is known of Ibn Miskawayh’s personal life. It is believed he converted to Islam from Zoroastrianism, the religion of pre-Islamic Iran. His interests included alchemy and poetry, and some 20 works are attributed to him. His most notable contributions, however, were in ethics and history. His moral treatise Tahdhīb al-akhlāq, influenced by the Aristotelian concept of the mean, is considered one of the best statements of Islamic philosophy. The Islamic philosopher Naṣīr al-Dīn Ṭūsī (died 1274) modelled his Akhlāq Naṣīrī (“The Naṣīrī Ethics”) on the Tahdhīb al-akhlāq.
As a historian Ibn Miskawayh is noted for his Persian “nationalist” bias and his conviction that the history of peoples offers moral instruction, as well as his abandonment of legends as a source. His universal history Kitāb tajarīb al-umam wa ta’aqub al-ḥimam (7 vol.; Eng. trans. by D.S. Margoliouth, The Eclipse of the Abbasid Caliphate, 1921), was noted for its use of all available sources and greatly stimulated the development of Islamic historiography.
