Bhāvaviveka,  (flourished 8th century), Indian Buddhist philosopher who was an interpreter of Nāgārjuna, the founder of Mādhyamika school of philosophy. The disciples of Nāgārjuna who continued to limit the use of logic to a negative and indirect method, known as prasaṅga, are called the prāsaṅgikas: of these, Aryadeva, Buddhapalita, and Candrakīrti are the most important. Bhāvaviveka, however, followed the method of direct reasoning and thus founded what is called the Svātantrika (svatantra; “independent”) school of Mādhyamika philosophy. With him Buddhist logic comes to its own. Bhāvaviveka developed a notion of two truths in which, at the level of conventional (as distinguished from ultimate) truth, reason could be used to support positive teachings and practices. The Svātantrika tradition played a very important role in the development of Buddhist philosophy in Tibet.
