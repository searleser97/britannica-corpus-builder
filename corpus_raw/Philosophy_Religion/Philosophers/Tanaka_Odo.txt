Tanaka Ōdō, original name Tanaka Kiichi,  (born 1867, Tomioka, Saitama prefecture, Japan—died  May 9, 1932, Tokyo), Japanese philosopher and critic who promoted within Japan the Western philosophy of pragmatism.
After learning English, Tanaka went to the United States in 1889 and studied first at the College of the Bible, a theological seminary in Kentucky, and later at the University of Chicago. He was profoundly influenced by such American philosophers as William James, George Santayana, and especially John Dewey at Chicago. After his return to Japan Tanaka taught at Waseda and Rikkyō universities and devoted himself to the study and promotion of pragmatism. In an effort to make pragmatism useful in Japanese society, Tanaka advocated combining functionalism with instrumentalism (i.e., having ideas represent the instruments for actions). He made use of his philosophy to attack the naturalism that was popular in early 20th-century Japanese literature. He was, in addition, a strong proponent of democracy and believed that it should be based on individualism.
Tanaka wrote numerous books, including Shosai yori gaitō ni (1911; “From the Study to the Street”), Tetsujin shugi (1912; “Philosophical Principles”), and Shōchō shugi no bunka e (1924; “On the Culture of Symbolism”).
