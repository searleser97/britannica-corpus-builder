Hemachandra, also called Somachandra, original name Chandradeva,  (born 1088, Dhandhuka, Gujarat, India—died 1172, Gujarat), teacher of the Shvetambara (“White-Robed”) sect of Jainism who gained privileges for his religion from Siddharaja Jayasimha, one of the greatest kings of Gujarat. Eloquent and erudite, Hemachandra also succeeded in converting the next king, Kumarapala, thus firmly entrenching Jainism in Gujarat.
Chandradeva’s birth is said to have been attended by omens and supernatural occurrences. His mother, according to tradition, had 14 dreams foretelling the birth of a wondrous son. When the child was taken to a Jain temple, the priest Devachandra recognized numerous marks on Chandradeva’s body as auspicious signs and convinced the parents to let him teach the boy.
When Chandradeva was ordained in 1110, he changed his name to Somachandra. In 1125 he became an adviser to King Kumarapala and wrote the Arhanniti, a work on politics from a Jain perspective. A prodigious writer, he produced Sanskrit and Prakrit grammars, textbooks on science and practically every branch of Indian philosophy, and several poems, including the Trishashtishalakapurusha-charita (“Deeds of the 63 Illustrious Men”), a Sanskrit epic of the history of the world as understood by Jain teachers. He was also a logician. Although derivative in many ways, his works have become classics, setting high standards for Sanskrit learning.
Jain doctrine is woven throughout his writings. When he was at last considered to have attained the rank of acharya (teacher), he changed his name to Hemachandra. In accordance with the Jain ideal for monks at the end of their life, Hemachandra fasted to death.
