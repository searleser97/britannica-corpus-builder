Critolaus,   (flourished  2nd century bc), Greek philosopher, a native of Phaselis in Lycia and a successor to Ariston of Ceos as head of the Peripatetic school of philosophy (followers of Aristotle). During his period of office he attempted to redirect the activities of the school back to its scientific and philosophical pursuits and away from the worldly preoccupations of his predecessors. Although his teachings were basically peripatetic, he was in part influenced by the stoics. Thus, he defined the highest good in such a way as to declare pleasure to be an evil. Goods of the soul, he insisted, entirely outweighed those of the body. His writings exist only in fragments.
