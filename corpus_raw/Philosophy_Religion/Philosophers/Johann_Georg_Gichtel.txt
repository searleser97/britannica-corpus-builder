Johann Georg Gichtel,  (born May 4/14, 1638, Imperial Free City of Regensburg—died  Jan. 21, 1710, Amsterdam), Protestant visionary and theosophist, who promoted the quasi-pantheistic teaching of the early 17th-century Lutheran mystic Jakob Böhme and compiled the first complete edition of Böhme’s works (1682–83, 10 vol.). Alienated from orthodox Lutheran doctrine and worship by his ascetic tendency (with the accent on celibacy) and by his ambiguous mysticism oscillating between monism and dualism, Gichtel founded a small sect that survived in Holland and Germany until recent times. He synthesized his teaching in Theosophia Practica (1701–22; “Practical Theosophy”).
