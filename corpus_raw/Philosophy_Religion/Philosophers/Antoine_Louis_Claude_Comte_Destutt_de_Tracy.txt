Antoine-Louis-Claude, Comte Destutt de Tracy,  (born July 20, 1754, Bourbonnais, France—died  March 9, 1836, Paris), French philosopher, soldier, and chief Idéologue, so called for the philosophical school of Idéologie, which he founded.
Born into a noble family that originated in Scotland, Destutt de Tracy became colonel of the Penthièvre regiment before being elected to the States General of 1789. He was promoted to brigadier early in 1792 but soon resigned his commission. He was imprisoned for nearly a year under the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution. An associate member of the French Institut National, he was also a member of the French Academy (1808), a senator during the reign of Napoleon I, and a peer after the restoration of the monarchy.
Destutt de Tracy coined the word idéologie (English: “ideology”) in 1796 as a name for his own “science of ideas.” Influenced by the work of John Locke, he presented his basic ideas in Éléments d’idéologie, 4 vol. (1801–15). Like the sensationalism of Étienne Bonnot de Condillac (1715–80), Idéologie stressed the importance of human sensations in the formation of knowledge. Destutt de Tracy, however, further refined Condillac’s views to emphasize the physiological nature of sensation. Human thought, he asserted, is nothing but an elaboration of sensations, an activity of the nervous system. The four principal realms of conscious behaviour—perception, memory, judgment, and will—all employ various combinations of sensations. As a result of its extreme dependence on the human senses for verification of knowledge, Idéologie threatened not only religious doctrine but secular authority as well, and the movement was suppressed by Napoleon from 1803.
In addition to an unfinished treatise on the human will, Traité de la volonté et de ses effets (1805; “Treatise on the Will and Its Effects”), Destutt de Tracy’s other writings include Grammaire générale (1803; “General Grammar”) and Logique (1805; “Logic”). His Commentaire sur l’esprit des lois de Montesquieu (Commentary and Review of Montesquieu’s Spirit of Laws), written in 1808, was translated and revised in 1811 by the American statesman Thomas Jefferson, with whom Destutt de Tracy corresponded.
