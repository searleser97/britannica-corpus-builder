Xavier Zubiri, in full José Xavier Zubiri Apalategui,  (born Dec. 4, 1898, San Sebastián, Spain—died  Dec. 21, 1983, Madrid), Spanish Christian Existential philosopher who was known for his analysis of reality in terms of the interrelations of philosophy, science, and religion.
Zubiri studied theology in Rome, philosophy in Madrid (under José Ortega y Gasset) and in Freiburg, Ger., and physics and biology at the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain), Belg. Influenced by Roman Catholic philosophy and positive science, he created a “religation theory” of reality whereby an individual’s relation to God and his sense of self were based on fulfillment of tasks obligatory upon entering the world. He was described as the shaper of Spanish philosophy from 1940 to 1980.
After teaching history of philosophy at the universities in Madrid (1926–36) and Barcelona (1940–42), with a hiatus during the Spanish Civil War, he gained recognition as a private tutor and author. His works include Ensayo de una teoría fenomenológica del juicio (1923; “Essay on a Phenomenological Theory of Judgment”), Naturaleza, historia, Dios (1944; “Nature, History, God”), Sobre la esencia (1962; “On Essence”), and Cinco lecciones de filosofía (1963; “Five Lessons of Philosophy”). Later works included the trilogy Inteligencia sentiente (1980; “Sentient Intelligence”), Inteligencia y logos (1982; “Intelligence and Logos”), and Inteligencia y razón (1983; “Intelligence and Reason”).
