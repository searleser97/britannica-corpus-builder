Raghunatha Shiromani,  (born c. 1475, Navadvipa, Bengal, India—died c. 1550), philosopher and logician who brought the New Nyaya school, representing the final development of Indian formal logic, to its zenith of analytic power.
Raghunatha’s analysis of relations revealed the true nature of number, inseparable from the abstraction of natural phenomena, and his studies of metaphysics dealt with the negation or nonexistence of a complex reality. His most famous work in logic was the Tattva-chintamani-didhiti, a commentary on the works of Gangesha, founder of the New Nyaya school.
