August Immanuel Bekker,  (born May 21, 1785, Berlin [Germany]—died  June 7, 1871, Berlin), German philologist and classical scholar who prepared a great array of critical editions of many classical Greek writers.
Bekker studied classics at the University of Halle and was appointed professor of philosophy at Friedrich-Wilhelm University, Berlin, in 1810. He traveled over the next decade in France, Italy, England, and Germany, examining classical manuscripts, gathering materials for his editions, and publishing some results of his research in Anecdota Graeca (1814–21; “Greek Anecdotes”). He relied solely on manuscripts to make his critical revisions. His best-known editions include those of Plato (1816–23), Aristophanes (1829), and Aristotle (1831–36) and the Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae, 25 vol. (c. 1850; “Body of Writings of Byzantine History”). The only Latin authors edited by him were Livy (1829–30) and Tacitus (1831). Bekker confined himself to textual recension and criticism, in which he relied solely upon the manuscripts, and contributed little to the extension of general scholarship.
