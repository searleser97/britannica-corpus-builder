Peregrinus Proteus,  (born c. ad 100, Parium, Mysia, Anatolia [now in Turkey]—died  165), Greek Cynic philosopher remembered for his spectacular suicide—he cremated himself on the flames of the Olympic Games in 165.
Suspected of murdering his father, Peregrinus was forced to flee to Palestine, but his influence in the Christian community there led to his arrest. On his release he left Palestine and became estranged from the Christians. He then went to Egypt, where he became a pupil of the Cynic philosopher Agathobulus. Peregrinus next went to Rome but was expelled by the prefect for insulting the emperor Antoninus Pius. After leaving Rome he went to Greece, where he was at first well received, but he compromised his popularity by disparaging the public benefactor Herodes Atticus. He then announced his intention of cremating himself and finally did so on a funeral pyre during the Olympic Games in the presence of many spectators, among whom was Lucian.
Lucian’s account of Peregrinus in the letter “On the Death of Peregrinus” depicts him as an opportunist and exhibitionist, but not all ancient authors agreed. Modern scholars tend to think of Peregrinus as sincere, however abnormal, in his enthusiasms.
