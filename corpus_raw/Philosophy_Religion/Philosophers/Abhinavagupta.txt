Abhinavagupta,  (flourished 1014, Kashmir, India), philosopher, ascetic, and aesthetician, as well as an outstanding representative of the “recognition” (pratyabhijna) school of Kashmiri Shaivite monism. This school conceived of the god Shiva (the manifestation of ultimate reality), the individual soul, and the universe as essentially one; pratyabhijna refers to the way of realizing this identity. Abhinavagupta was a prolific writer on philosophy and aesthetics. Among his most notable philosophic works are the Ishvara-pratyabhijna-vimarshini and the more detailed Ishvara-pratyabhijna-vivritri-vimarshini, both commentaries on Ishvara-pratyabhijna (“Recognition of God”), by Utpala, an earlier philosopher of the pratyabhijna school.
