Nathanael Culverwel,  (born 1618?, London, Eng.—died  1651?), English empiricist philosopher who specialized in the application of reason to ethical problems, remembered as a probable influence on John Locke.
Details of Culverwel’s life are obscure. Though it is known that he was elected to a fellowship at the University of Cambridge in 1642, he is thought to have suffered a mental breakdown in his last years. His writings were published posthumously as Spiritual Opticks (1651), a set of six sermons, and a one-volume edition of collected works (1652).
Culverwel’s best-known essay, An Elegant and Learned Discourse of the Light of Nature (1652), was intended as the introduction to a larger work in which he hoped to defend reason against its more extreme opponents and faith against rationalist reductionists. Reared in the strict spiritual climate of Calvinism, he stopped short of a complete embrace of rationalism. Reason is necessary, he asserted, because it shows men the need for revelation and the existence of divine law. God’s will, however, rather than reason, is the “rule of good and evil.” This retention of Calvinist attitudes distinguishes Culverwel from the Cambridge Platonists. Contrary to the Platonists’ view, he believed that human reason does not participate in divine reason but merely reflects it dimly.
