Hatano Seiichi,  (born July 21, 1877, Matsumoto, Nagano prefecture, Japan—died  Jan. 17, 1950, Tokyo), Japanese scholar and author of pioneering works on Christianity and Western philosophy that were widely studied in Japanese universities.
After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University in 1899, Hatano became the first professor to teach the history of Western philosophy at Tokyo Semmon Gakkō (now Waseda University). He studied in Germany from 1904 to 1907 and returned to become a lecturer in philosophy at Tokyo University and later at Kyōto University. Upon his retirement from Kyōto University in 1947, he served as president of Tamagawa Gakuen University until his death.
Hatano’s Seiyō tetsugakushi yō (“Outline of the History of Western Philosophy”), written in 1907, was the first serious attempt in Japan to produce a survey of Western philosophy and soon became required reading for all university students. During the following years, Hatano did a series of studies on Christianity, which, in place of the usual polemics, attempted a serious philosophical approach. His major works on Christianity are: Kirisuto-kyō no kigen (1909; “Origin of Christianity”), Seiyō shūkyō shioshi (1921; “History of Western Religious Thought”), Shūkyō tetsugaku (1935; “Religious Philosophy”), and Toki to ei’en (1943; “Time and Eternity”).
