Géraud de Cordemoy,  (born c. 1620, Paris—died  Oct. 8, 1684, Paris), French historian and philosopher, who showed considerable originality in his development of the general principles of physical theory. He introduced a new atomism into the mechanistic system of René Descartes by linking unity and substantiality; matter is homogeneous but contains a multiplicity of bodies each of which is an individual substance. His works include Le Discernement du corps et de l’âme (1666; “The Differentiation of the Body and the Soul”) and Lettre à un savant religieux de la Comp. de Jésus (1668), on animal magnetism.
