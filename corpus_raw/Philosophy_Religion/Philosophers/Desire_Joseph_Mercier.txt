Désiré-Joseph Mercier,  (born Nov. 21, 1851, Braine-l’Alleud, Belg.—died  Jan. 23, 1926, Brussels), Belgian educator, cardinal, and a leader in the 19th-century revival of the philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas.
Mercier was ordained in 1874 and taught philosophy at the seminary of Malines, Belg. (1877–82). In 1880 Pope Leo XIII requested that a program in Thomistic philosophy be offered at the Catholic University of Leuven (Louvain), Belg., for which Mercier was appointed professor in 1882. His lectures there on Thomism in relation to modern philosophy and science attracted an international body of students. With the support of Leo, Mercier founded (1894) the Superior Institute of Philosophy at Leuven and served as its first president. The institute became a major centre of Thomism, publishing the Revue Néoscolastique (now Revue Philosophique de Louvain) and evaluating contemporary philosophies. Pope St. Pius X made Mercier archbishop (1906) of Malines and cardinal (1907). During World War I his stand against the Germans for their burning of the Leuven Library and for deporting workmen made him an international spokesman for the Belgians. Invited to visit the United States by President Woodrow Wilson, Mercier made a tour of that country and Canada (1919) that brought him honours and financial support to rebuild the Leuven Library.
In 1951 the Cardinal Mercier Chair was endowed at Leuven to support lectures by visiting philosophers. Mercier’s works include Manual of Modern Scholastic Philosophy, 2 vol. (with professors of Leuven; trans. by T.L. and S.A. Parker, 1917–18), and Origins of Contemporary Psychology (trans. by W.H. Mitchell, 1918).
