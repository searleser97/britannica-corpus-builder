Adam Ferguson,   (born June 20, 1723, Logierait, Perthshire, Scot.—died  Feb. 22, 1816, St. Andrews, Fife), historian and philosopher of the Scottish “common sense” school of philosophy who is remembered as a forerunner of modern sociology for his emphasis on social interactions.
Educated at the University of St. Andrews, Ferguson was appointed deputy chaplain to Scotland’s Black Watch Regiment in 1745 and engaged in combat in Flanders. In 1757 he abandoned the clerical profession to succeed his friend David Hume as keeper of the Advocates’ Library in Edinburgh. He became professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in 1759 and professor of mental and moral philosophy there in 1764. Before resigning his chair in 1785, he had written his major works, which include The Morality of Stage Plays Seriously Considered (1757); Essay on the History of Civil Society (1767); Institutes of Moral Philosophy (1769); and Remarks (1776), in which Ferguson proposed peace terms for the North Americans fighting in the American Revolution.
In 1778 Ferguson traveled to Philadelphia with a British commission sent to negotiate with American revolutionaries. He spent his later years in retirement at St. Andrews. Sir Walter Scott composed his epitaph.
Ferguson is chiefly remembered for the Essay on the History of Civil Society, an intellectual history that traces humanity’s progression from barbarism to social and political refinement. In his philosophy Ferguson emphasized society as the wellspring of human morals and actions and, indeed, of the human condition itself.
Among his other works are The History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic, 3 vol. (1783), and Principles of Moral and Political Science, 2 vol. (1792).
Ferguson wrote the article on history for the second edition of Encyclopædia Britannica (1780), which included the first timeline presented in the encyclopaedia.
