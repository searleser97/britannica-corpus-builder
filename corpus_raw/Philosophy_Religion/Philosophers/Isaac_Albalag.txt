Isaac Albalag,  (flourished 13th century ad, northern Spain or southern France), Jewish philosopher who rendered a Hebrew translation of parts of the Maqāṣid al-falāsifah (“Aims of the Philosophers”), a review of doctrines of earlier thinkers by the Arabic philosopher al-Ghazālī, to which Albalag added his own views and comments. In defending philosophy against the accusation that it undermined religion, Albalag espoused the doctrine of the “double truth”—prophetic truth known through revelation and philosophic truth arrived at through reason. He believed philosophy and religion were in fundamental agreement but that religion was for the masses and philosophy for the few. He felt that philosophy need not bow to revelation when the results of its speculations disagree with revelation.
