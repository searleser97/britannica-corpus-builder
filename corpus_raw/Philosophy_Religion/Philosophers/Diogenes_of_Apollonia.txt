Diogenes Of Apollonia,   (flourished  5th century bc), Greek philosopher remembered for his cosmology and for his efforts to synthesize ancient views and new discoveries.
It is uncertain whether Diogenes’ birthplace, from which his name is derived, was the Apollonia of Crete or that of Phrygia (in modern Turkey). He lived most of his life in Athens, where his opinions were a source of danger to his life and were derided by the playwright Aristophanes in his Nephelai (“The Clouds”). Among numerous fragments of his works, written in Ionic Greek, is the important book Peri physeōs (“On Nature”). The treatises Against the Sophists and the Nature of Man may have been part of this work. Aristotle, in his Historia animalium (“The History of Animals”), quotes a long passage from Diogenes on veins. Because Diogenes sought to support his metaphysical position by painstaking observations in anatomy and physiology, he is sometimes considered to be one of the early Empiricists.
