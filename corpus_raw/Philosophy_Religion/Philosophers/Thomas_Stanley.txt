Thomas Stanley,  (born 1625, Cumberlow, Hertfordshire, Eng.—died  April 12, 1678, London), English poet, translator, and the first English historian of philosophy.
Stanley was the son of Sir Thomas Stanley, himself the grandson of Thomas Stanley, a natural son of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby. The younger Stanley was educated by William Fairfax, son of the translator of Torquato Tasso. He became a good classical scholar and an enthusiastic student of French, Italian, and Spanish poetry. Stanley entered Pembroke Hall (later College), Cambridge, in 1639 and studied there and at the University of Oxford, graduating with an M.A. in 1641.
Stanley was the friend of many poets and himself a prolific translator and writer of verse. He traveled on the European continent during the English Civil Wars and on his return lived in the Middle Temple, London, where he devoted himself to literary work. His first volume of poems appeared in 1647. Subsequent volumes included translations from Anacreon, Bion, Decimus Magnus Ausonius, Battista Guarini, Giambattista Marino, Petrarch, Pierre de Ronsard, and others. His classic renderings of the Anacreontic poems were published in 1651, and the same collection contains his version of Pico della Mirandola’s A Platonick Discourse upon Love. Stanley’s The History of Philosophy, which long remained a standard work, was published in 1655–62, and his edition of Aeschylus with Latin translation and commentary in 1663. He had a graceful if tenuous gift as a lyrical poet and was a versatile and accomplished translator.
