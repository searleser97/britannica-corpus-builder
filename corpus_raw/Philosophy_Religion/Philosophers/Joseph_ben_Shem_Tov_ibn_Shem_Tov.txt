Joseph ben Shem Tov ibn Shem Tov,  (born c. 1400—died c. 1480), Jewish philosopher and Castilian court physician who attempted to mediate the disdain shown for philosophy by contemporary Jewish scholars by undertaking a reconciliation of Aristotelian ethical philosophy with Jewish religious thought, best exemplified by his influential Kevod Elohim (written 1442; “The Glory of God”). Here he expounded his belief that answers sought through philosophical inquiry can be valuable in one’s quest for religious knowledge and that even religious principles should be subjected to such inquiry. Although as a philosopher he advocated intellectual pursuits, Joseph maintained that the immortality of the soul was assured not by intellectual development but by conscientious religious observance. He also upheld the value of mysticism and intuition in the understanding of religious precepts.
