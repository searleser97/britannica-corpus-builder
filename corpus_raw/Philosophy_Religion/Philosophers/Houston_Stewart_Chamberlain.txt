Houston Stewart Chamberlain,  (born Sept. 9, 1855, Southsea, Hampshire, Eng.—died  Jan. 9, 1927, Bayreuth, Ger.), British-born Germanophile political philosopher, whose advocacy of the racial and cultural superiority of the so-called Aryan element in European culture influenced pan-German and German nationalist thought, particularly Adolf Hitler’s National Socialist movement.
Educated at Versailles, Geneva, and Vienna, Chamberlain became an admirer of Richard Wagner, publishing his first work, Notes sur Lohengrin (“Notes on Lohengrin”), in 1892. An analysis of Wagner’s drama (1892) and a biography (1895) followed. In these publications, Chamberlain emphasized the heroic Teutonic aspects in the composer’s works. In 1899 he published Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts (The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, 2 vol., 1911), a broad but biased analysis of European culture, in which he claimed that the Western Aryan peoples have been responsible for the greatness and creativity of Europe, and that the Jewish influence has been primarily negative. Chamberlain’s theories owed much to the writings of Joseph Arthur, comte de Gobineau, who was the first to claim to prove the superiority of the “Nordic” race.
Chamberlain’s later works included studies of Kant (1905) and Goethe (1912), various essays defending Germany’s military efforts and aims during World War I, the autobiographical Lebenswege meines Denkens (1919; “Paths of My Thought”), and Rasse und Persönlichkeit (1925; “Race and Personality”). In 1907 he settled in Bayreuth and married Wagner’s only daughter Eva, his second wife. Remaining in Germany during World War I, Chamberlain received the German Military Cross in 1915 and became naturalized the next year.
