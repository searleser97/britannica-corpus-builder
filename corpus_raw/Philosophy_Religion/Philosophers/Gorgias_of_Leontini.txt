Gorgias of Leontini,  (born c. 483â€”died c. 376 bce), Greek Sophist and rhetorician who made important contributions to rhetorical theory and practice. In a lost work he argued for the nonexistence, unknowability, or uncommunicability of Being. Plato treats him, in the dialogue Gorgias, as a rhetorician only.
