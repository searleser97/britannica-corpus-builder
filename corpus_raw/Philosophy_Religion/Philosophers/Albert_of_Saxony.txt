Albert Of Saxony, also called Albert Of Ricmestorp, or Of Halberstadt, German Albert Von Sachsen, or Von Ricmestorp, or Von Halberstadt,  (born c. 1316, Helmstedt, Saxony—died July 8, 1390, Halberstadt), German scholastic philosopher especially noted for his investigations into physics.
He studied at Prague and then at the University of Paris, where he was a master of arts from 1351 to 1362 and rector in 1353. Most probably he is to be identified with the Albert of Ricmestorp, or Rückmersdorf, who was rector of the University of Vienna in 1365 and bishop of Halberstadt from 1366 until his death there in 1390.
Albert based his logic on William Ockham, his physical theory on Jean Buridan, his mathematics on Thomas Bradwardine, and his ethics on Walter Burley (rejecting Buridan’s psychological determinism) and was at first respected more for his clarity and exactness in exposition than for his originality. The later scholastic logicians adopted many of the terminological distinctions first found in his works, and he examined and classified 254 sophismata or logical paradoxes. In physics, he wrote at length on place, space, and time; on the impossibility of a plurality of worlds; and, in great detail, on the movement of bodies (Leonardo da Vinci seems to have been indebted to him on this subject). Albert gave particular attention to the problem of gravity, being perhaps the first thinker to distinguish the centre of gravity from the geometrical centre, and to that of the velocity of falling bodies, appreciating that the question was whether velocity was proportional to time or to space. He was also one of the first to understand what is now known as aerostatics, as he maintained that a light balloon would rise and remain suspended in the air if a particle of fire were enclosed in it. Finally, his search for mathematical formulas to express laws of nature foreshadowed the usage of modern physics.
