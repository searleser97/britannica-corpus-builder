Kumarila, also called Kumarilla-bhatta,  (born 730 ce), Indian dialectician, teacher, and interpreter of Jaimini’s Mimamsa-sutras (“The Profound-Thought Sutras”), or Purva-mimamsa system (200 bce).
Tradition says that Kumarila was converted to Buddhism as a youth, but he returned to Hinduism and became a great defender of Vedic philosophy and practices, especially stressing the requirement of moksha (ritual sacrifice for liberation from the cycles of death and reincarnation). Kumarila publicly debated Jain and Buddhist teachers throughout India on the issue of the immortality of the individual soul and tried to persuade the powerful to withdraw their patronage of Buddhist monasteries. He hoped, through his revival of Hinduism, to weaken and stop the spread of those two religions in South India.
Kumarila added an epistemological element to the Mimamsa collection of aphorisms, ritual, and inheritance law. Kumarila and his contemporary (and possibly disciple) Prabhakara are the chief exponents of the tenets found in the Mimamsa-sutras. Of these two interpretations, Kumarila’s is the more widely read, and it is considered the chief source for the study of this philosophy.
