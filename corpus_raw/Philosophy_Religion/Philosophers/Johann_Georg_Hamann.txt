Johann Georg Hamann,  (born Aug. 27, 1730, Königsberg, Prussia [now Kaliningrad, Russia]—died  June 21, 1788, Münster, Westphalia [Germany]), German Protestant thinker, fideist, and friend of the philosopher Immanuel Kant. His distrust of reason led him to conclude that a childlike faith in God was the only solution to vexing problems of philosophy.
Largely self-educated, he made his living as a secretary-translator at Riga and Courland and as a government employee (1767–84) in the excise office and customhouse. Impatient with the rationalistic abstractions of the Enlightenment and with the systematic idealism of Kant (though retaining Kant’s friendship), Hamann viewed truth as a necessary unity of reason, faith, and experience. His main concern was to reconcile philosophy and Christianity.
J. Nadler’s edition of his writings, Johann Georg Hamann: Werke, 6 vol. (1949–57), coupled with the rise of Christian existentialism, did much to revive interest in Hamann, whose cryptic and paradoxical style long delayed appreciation of his influence on German literature, on religious thought, and on such philosophers as Schelling, Hegel, and Kierkegaard.
