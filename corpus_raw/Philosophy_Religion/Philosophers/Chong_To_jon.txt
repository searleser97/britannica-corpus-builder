Chŏng To-jŏn,  (died 1398), Korean Neo-Confucian scholar who helped to overthrow the Koryŏ kingdom (918–1392 ce) and establish the Chosŏn kingdom (1392–1910). He was of a nonaristocratic family and promoted Confucian learning and the rise of the bureaucratic class. With the fall of the Koryo patronage of Buddhism and the rise of the Chosŏn kingdom, he championed a sweeping reform of education and government along Neo-Confucian lines. Related to these reforms were his polemical writings against Buddhism, Daoism, and other traditional shamanistic practices. Adhering to an exclusive Neo-Confucian political ideology and philosophical metaphysics, he condemned Buddhism and Daoism as being inherently antithetical to public-spirited service. Developments in later Buddhism and Daoism in Korea often represent an ameliorative response to these attacks.
