Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire,  (born Aug. 19, 1805, Paris, France—died  Nov. 24, 1895, Paris), French politician, journalist, and scholar.
Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire worked briefly for the Ministry of Finance (1825–28) before becoming a journalist. In 1838 he became professor of ancient philosophy at the Collège de France. Following the Revolution of 1848, he was elected to the national Chamber of Deputies from the district of Seine-et-Oise, but he withdrew after the coup d’état of 1851. Reelected deputy from Seine-et-Oise in 1869, he aligned with the moderates against the dictatorial policies of Napoleon III and joined in the proposal that Adolphe Thiers, a republican politician, become head of the executive power. Appointed an unpaid secretary to Thiers, Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire also became senator for life in 1875, was vice president of the Senate (1880), and served as minister of foreign affairs under Premier Jules Ferry (1880–81).
Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire wrote in the areas of history, sociology, political economy, and languages. He published a translation of the works of Marcus Aurelius (1876) and wrote several studies of Oriental religions, but he is perhaps best remembered for his monumental 35-volume translation (1833–95) of the works of Aristotle.
