Louis Lavelle,  (born July 15, 1883, Saint-Martin-de-Villeréal, Fr.—died  Sept. 1, 1951, Saint-Martin-de-Villeréal), French philosopher recognized as a forerunner of the psychometaphysic movement, which teaches that self-actualization and ultimate freedom develop from seeking one’s “inward” being and relating it to the Absolute. Much of his thought drew upon the writings of Nicolas Malebranche and St. Augustine.
Lavelle received a doctorate from the Lycée Fustel de Coulanges, Strasbourg (1921), before becoming professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne (1932–34) and the Collège de France (1941–51). He was appointed inspector general of national education (1941) and elected to the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in 1947. His major works include La Dialectique du monde sensible (1921; “The Dialectic of the World of the Senses”), La Conscience de soi (1933; “Self-Awareness”), La Présence totale (1934; “The Total Presence”), Le Mal et la souffrance (1940; “Evil and Suffering”), and Introduction à l’ontologie (1947; “Introduction to Ontology”).
