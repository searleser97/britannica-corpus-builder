Eusebius of Myndus,  (flourished  4th century ad), Neoplatonist philosopher, a pupil of Aedesius of Pergamum. He was distinguished from the other members of the Pergamene school by his comparative sobriety and rationality and by his contempt for the religious magic, or theurgy, to which other members of the school were addicted. He was too sober for the future emperor Julian (“the Apostate”), who turned from his philosophical teachings to the sensations provided by the wonder-worker Maximus of Ephesus.
