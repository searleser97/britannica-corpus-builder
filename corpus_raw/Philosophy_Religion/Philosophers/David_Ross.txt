Sir David Ross, in full William David Ross,  (born April 15, 1877, Thurso, Caithness, Scot.—died  May 5, 1971), Scottish rationalistic moral philosopher and critic of utilitarianism who proposed a form of “cognitivist nondefinitism” based on intuitional knowledge rather than “naturalism.” He distinguished his views from Kantian philosophy by subscribing to an ethic of obligation that depended more on immediate knowledge and belief than on objective absolutes. By claiming that duty was intuitive, he suggested that “good,” which pertains to motives, and “right,” which pertains to acts, are indefinable and irreducible terms.
Schooled in the classics at the University of Edinburgh and Balliol College, Oxford, Ross gained recognition as an Aristotelian scholar by editing the Oxford English translations of Aristotle (1908–31); he translated the Metaphysics (1908) and Ethica Nicomachea (1925) himself. Ross’s notable academic and public career included his rise from lecturer to provost at Oriel College (1902–47), his appointment as vice-chancellor of Oxford University (1941–44), president of the Union Académique Internationale (1947), chairman of the Royal Commission on the Press (1947–49), and his knighthood in 1938 for outstanding munitions work during World War I. Among his writings are Aristotle (1923), The Right and the Good (1930), Foundations of Ethics (1939), Plato’s Theory of Ideas (1951), and Kant’s Ethical Theory (1954).
