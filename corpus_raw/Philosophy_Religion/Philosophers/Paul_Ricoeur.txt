Paul Ricoeur, in full Jean Paul Gustave Ricoeur,  (born February 27, 1913, Valence, France—died May 20, 2005, Châtenay-Malabry), French philosopher and historian, who studied various linguistic and psychoanalytic theories of interpretation.
Ricoeur graduated from the University of Rennes in 1932 and engaged in graduate studies of philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris, receiving master’s (1935) and doctoral (1950) degrees there. He served on the faculties of a number of institutions (1933–48) before becoming professor successively at the University of Strasbourg (1948–56) and the University of Paris at Nanterre (now University of Paris X; 1956–70). Ricoeur also taught at a several schools in the United States, including the University of Chicago (1971–91).
Ricoeur tried to mediate between the conflicting interpretations offered by phenomenology and such contemporary movements as structuralism and post-structuralism, hermeneutics, and semiotics. He focused on language and the interpretation of meaning, emphasizing the idea that Freudian, Marxist, and other interpretative traditions involve a dialectic of both negative and positive assumptions and expectations. He also tried to relate modern traditions of linguistic and critical analysis to various precursor movements in the history of Jewish and Christian biblical exegesis, an effort that gives much of his writing a theological cast.
Ricoeur’s principal writings included Le Volontaire et l’involontaire (1950; Freedom and Nature: The Voluntary and the Involuntary), which is the first volume in Philosophie de la volonté, 3 vol. (1950–60; Philosophy of the Will); Histoire et vérité (1955; History and Truth); Le Conflit des interprétations: essais d’herméneutique (1969; The Conflict of Interpretations: Essays in Hermeneutics); Temps et récit, 3 vol. (1983–85; Time and Narrative); and Soi-même comme un autre (1990; Oneself as Another).
