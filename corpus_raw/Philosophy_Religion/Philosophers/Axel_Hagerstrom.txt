Axel Hägerström, in full Axel Anders Theodor Hägerström,  (born Sept. 6, 1868, Vireda, Sweden—died  July 7, 1939), Swedish philosopher who founded the Uppsala school of philosophy, which espoused phenomenological and conceptual analysis and rejected metaphysical suppositions and subjectivism.
Raised in a religious home, Hägerström commenced studies in theology (1886) but received his degree in philosophy from the University of Uppsala, where he remained as a lecturer and then professor (1893–1933). He was originally influenced by the idealism and then the Kantianism of his contemporaries; and his early works, Das Prinzip der Wissenschaft (1908; “The Principle of Science”) and Botanisten och filosofen (1910; “The Botanist and the Philosopher”), discussed the role of “ego” in determining individual reality. Not subscribing to any philosophical system, he later concentrated on the theory of reality while criticizing legal, religious, and moral ideology. His key works are Social teleologi i marxismen (1909; “Social Teleology in Marxism”), Om Moraliska Föreställningars Sanning (1911; “On the Truth of Moral Ideas”), and Der römische Obligationsbegriff im Lichte der allgemeinen römischen Rechtsanschauung, 2 vol. (1927–41; “The Roman Notion of Obligation in the Light of the General Roman View of Law”).
