Carneades,  (born 214? bce—died 129?), Greek philosopher who headed the New Academy at Athens when antidogmatic skepticism reached its greatest strength.
A native of Cyrene (now in Libya), Carneades went in 155 bce on a diplomatic mission to Rome, where he delivered two public orations, in which he argued in favour of justice in one speech and argued against it in the other. This arguing on both sides of a question expressed Carneades’ attitude of suspending judgment, an attitude characteristic of academic, or antidogmatic, skepticism. The facility Carneades displayed in this regard helped arouse the first Roman interest in Greek philosophy, while also arousing the distrust of the Roman authorities.
Ultimately, Carneades’ noncommittal attitude was rooted in his denial that there exists any certain knowledge, either of the senses or of the intellect. In this spirit, he criticized both Epicurean and stoic beliefs as inconclusive. Many of his arguments on this point later attained classic status. Carneades also defended the philosopher Arcesilaus against the stoics and Epicureans in the controversy over knowledge. Because no reliable criterion of truth exists, Carneades argued, Arcesilaus was right to urge the withholding of assent from any experience that claimed to be knowledge. Though Carneades left no writings, his teachings were preserved by Cleitomachus.
