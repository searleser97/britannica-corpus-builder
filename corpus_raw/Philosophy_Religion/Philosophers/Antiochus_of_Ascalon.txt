Antiochus Of Ascalon,   (born c. 120 bcâ€”died  68 bc), Greek philosopher who followed Philo of Larissa as the head of the Academy, charting a new course for Platonism. He built up his philosophical system on a foundation of three schools: Platonism, Peripateticism, and Stoicism. Stoic ideas played the most important role in his thinking. He rebelled against two Skeptics, Arcesilaus and Carneades, both of whom had a strong influence on the direction of Platonism, and broke the ground for a more positive direction.
