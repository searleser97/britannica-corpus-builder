Lu Jiuyuan, Wade-Giles romanization Lu Chiu-Yuan, courtesy name (tzu) Zijing, literary name (hao) Cunjai, also called Master Xiangshan,  (born 1139, Jiangxi, China—died Jan. 10, 1193, China), Idealist neo-Confucian philosopher of the Southern Song and rival of his contemporary, the great neo-Confucian rationalist Zhu Xi. Lu’s thought was revised and refined three centuries later by the Ming dynasty neo-Confucian Wang Yangming. The name of their school is the Learning of the Heart-and-Mind (xinxue), often called the Lu-Wang school, after its two great proponents. It was opposed to the other great (and dominant) school, the Learning of Principle (lixue), often called the Cheng-Zhu school after its leading philosophers, Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi.
Lu held a number of government posts but devoted most of his life to teaching and lecturing. In contrast to Zhu Xi’s emphasis on “constant inquiry and study,” Lu taught that the highest knowledge of the Way (Dao) comes from the constant practice of inner reflection and self-education. In this process, man develops his original goodness, for human nature is basically good, or regains his goodness if it has been corrupted and lost through material desires (wuyu).
After his death, Lu’s works were collected and published under the title of Xiangshan xiansheng chuanji (“Complete Works of Master Xiangshan”). In 1217 he was canonized as Wenan, and in 1530 a tablet in his honour was placed in the central Confucian temple of the Ming dynasty.
