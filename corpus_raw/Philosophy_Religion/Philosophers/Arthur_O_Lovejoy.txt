Arthur O. Lovejoy, in full Arthur Oncken Lovejoy,  (born Oct. 10, 1873, Berlin, Ger.—died  Dec. 30, 1962, Baltimore, Md., U.S.), American philosopher best known for his work on the history of ideas and theory of knowledge.
The son of a Boston minister and his German wife, Lovejoy received his B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley (1895), and his M.A. from Harvard University (1897) before studying at the Sorbonne. After teaching at Stanford University (1899–1901), Washington University (1901–07), and the University of Missouri (1908–10), he joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University in 1910 and, at the time of his death, was emeritus professor of philosophy there. He founded the Journal of the History of Ideas after his retirement in 1938, and he was a cofounder of the American Association of University Professors.
Lovejoy’s most famous work, The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea (1936), which was an expansion of lectures he had delivered at Harvard in 1933, traced the history of the “principle of plenitude” (i.e., that all possibilities are to be realized) from the time of the early Greeks to the 18th century. Essays in the History of Ideas (1948), which treated such general ideas as Romanticism, evolutionism, naturalism, and primitivism, further stamped Lovejoy as America’s chief historian of ideas. His major philosophical work, The Revolt Against Dualism (1930), was an attempt to defend epistemological dualism against 20th-century monism. His last works were Reflections on Human Nature (1961) and The Reason, the Understanding, and Time (1961), which dealt with Romanticism. See also Great Chain of Being.
