Phaedo, , also spelled Phaedon,  (born c. 417 bc, Elis, in the Peloponnesus [Greece]), philosopher, founder of a Socratic school of philosophy at Elis on the Peloponnese, and author of works on dialectics and ethics.
Born of an aristocratic family, Phaedo was made a prisoner in the war with Sparta (400–399 bc) and was sold as a slave. Bought and freed by an Athenian who was a friend of Socrates, Phaedo became Socrates’ disciple. Plato named one of his dialogues after him. After Socrates’ death, Phaedo returned to Elis and established his school.
Many dialogues were attributed to Phaedo, but only the Zopyrus and Simon have survived.
