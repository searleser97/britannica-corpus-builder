Georg Jellinek,  (born June 16, 1851, Leipzig [Germany]—died January 12, 1911, Heidelberg, Germany), German legal and political philosopher who, in his book Die sozialethische Bedeutung von Recht, Unrecht und Strafe (1878; 2nd ed., 1908; “The Social-Ethical Significance of Right, Wrong, and Punishment”), defined the law as an ethical minimum—i.e., as a body of normative principles essential to civilized existence. Differing from the influential school of legal positivists, Jellinek insisted that law had a social origin, and thus popular approval was necessary to convert social and psychological facts into juristic norms.
Jellinek, the son of the rabbinic scholar Adolf Jellinek, became a convert to Christianity. At the universities of Vienna (1879–89), Basel (1890–91), and Heidelberg (1891–1911), he was a capable classroom teacher as well as a distinguished scholar. Internationally, probably his best-known work is The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizens (1895; originally in German), in which he hypothesized that the French Revolutionary declaration (approved by the National Constituent Assembly on August 26, 1789) was derived not so much from the writings of the French Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau—as had generally been believed—but chiefly from Anglo-American political and legal history, especially from the theories invoked to support the American struggle for independence. Jellinek synthesized his views in Allgemeine Staatslehre (1900; “General Theory of the State”).
