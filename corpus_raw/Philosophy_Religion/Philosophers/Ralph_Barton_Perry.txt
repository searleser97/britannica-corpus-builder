Ralph Barton Perry,  (born July 3, 1876, Poultney, Vt., U.S.—died  Jan. 22, 1957, Cambridge, Mass.), American educator and philosopher noted as the founder of the school of new realism in American pragmatic philosophy.
Educated at a private school in Philadelphia and at Princeton (A.B., 1896) and Harvard (M.A., 1897; Ph.D., 1899) universities, Perry began a teaching career that spanned nearly half a century when, in 1899, he became a philosophy instructor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass.; he then taught philosophy briefly at Smith College in Northampton, Mass. In 1902 he went to Harvard in the same role and remained there until his retirement in 1946. By 1913 he had become a full professor, and in 1930 he was made Edgar Pierce professor of philosophy.
Heavily influenced by William James, Perry was founder of the school of new realism, which sought to refine and develop James’s pragmatism. He edited James’s works and wrote a biography—The Thought and Character of William James—that earned him a Pulitzer Prize (1936). Among his other books are The Approach to Philosophy (1905), General Theory of Value (1926), and Realms of Value (1954).
