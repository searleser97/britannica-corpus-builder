Agrippa,  (flourished  2nd century ad), ancient Greek philosophical skeptic. He is famous for his formulation of the five tropes, or grounds for the suspension of judgment, that summarize the method of argument of Greek skeptics generally.
Agrippa’s five arguments held that (1) there is a clash of opinions, both in daily life and in the debates of philosophers; (2) nothing is self-evident, because that which is called a proof is merely a second proposition itself in need of demonstration, and so on ad infinitum; (3) both perception and judgment are relative in a double sense: each is relative to a subject, and each is affected by concomitant perceptions; (4) dogmatic philosophers seeking to avoid the infinite regression merely offer hypotheses that they cannot prove; and (5) philosophers are caught in the double bind by trying to prove the sensible by the intelligible and the intelligible by the sensible. Doubting both the evidence of the senses and the possibility of understanding, Agrippa concluded that human beings have no starting point for obtaining knowledge. Agrippa’s 5 arguments seem to have been based in part on the 10 tropes of the earlier skeptic Aenesidemus, but Agrippa’s skepticism is more thorough and is not limited to the sense perceptions that Aenesidemus questioned.
