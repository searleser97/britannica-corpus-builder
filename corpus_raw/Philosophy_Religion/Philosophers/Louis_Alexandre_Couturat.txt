Louis Couturat,  (born Jan. 17, 1868, Ris-Orangis, near Paris, France—died  Aug. 3, 1914, Paris), French philosopher and logician who sought a universal language and symbolic-logic system to study the history of philosophy and the philosophy of mathematics.
Educated at the École Normale Supérieure in philosophy and mathematics, Couturat became a professor at the University of Toulouse and the Collège de France before dedicating himself to private research. To promote his international language of Ido based on the “rational intuition” of Esperanto, Couturat helped to organize the International Congress of Philosophy (1900), to prepare Vocabulaire technique et critique de la philosophie (1926; “Technical Vocabulary and Critique of Philosophy”), and to establish Progresso (1908), a monthly publication written in Ido.
Couturat’s major works include De l’Infini mathématique (1896; “On Mathematical Infinity”), La Logique de Leibniz (1901; “The Logic of Leibniz”), Histoire de la langue universelle (1903, with L. Leau; “History of the Universal Language”), L’Algèbre de la logique (1905; “The Algebra of Logic”), and Les Principes de mathématiques (1905; “The Principles of Mathematics”).
