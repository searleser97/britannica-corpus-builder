Isaak August Dorner,  (born June 20, 1809, Neuhausen, Württemberg [Germany]—died  July 8, 1884, Wiesbaden, Ger.), German Protestant theologian who sought to interpret Kantian and post-Kantian thought in terms of traditional Lutheran doctrine. The best known of the English translations of his many works is History of the Development of the Doctrine of the Person of Christ, 5 vol. (1861–63). Among the English versions of Dorner’s writings that strove to mediate the liberal–conservative controversy within 19th-century German Protestantism are History of Protestant Theology, 2 vol. (1871), System of Christian Doctrine, 4 vol. (1880–82), and System of Christian Ethics (1887).
