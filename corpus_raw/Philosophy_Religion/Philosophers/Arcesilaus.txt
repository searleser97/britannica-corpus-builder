Arcesilaus,   (born 316/315 bc, Pitane, Aeolis [now in Turkey]—died c. 241), philosopher who succeeded Crates as head of the Greek Academy; he introduced a skepticism derived either from Socrates or from Pyrrhon and Timon. Refusing to accept or deny the possibility of certainty in knowing, Arcesilaus advocated a skeptical “suspension of judgment” (epochē). The stoics (who held a theory of “irresistible impressions”) attacked him for thus paralyzing man and vitiating the goal of philosophy, which they believed was to make man happy and vigorous. Arcesilaus replied that a wise man need know only that his actions are “reasonable” (eulogon).
