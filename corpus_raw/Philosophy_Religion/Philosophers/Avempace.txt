Avempace, also called Ibn Bājjah, in full Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn al-Sāyigh al-Tujībī al-Andalusī al-Saraqustī,  (born c. 1095, Zaragoza, Spain—died 1138/39, Fès, Morocco), earliest known representative in Spain of the Arabic Aristotelian–Neoplatonic philosophical tradition (see Arabic philosophy) and forerunner of the polymath scholar Ibn Ṭufayl and of the philosopher Averroës.
Avempace’s chief philosophical tenets seem to have included belief in the possibility that the human soul could become united with the Divine. This union was conceived as the final stage in an intellectual ascent beginning with the impressions of sense objects that consist of form and matter and rising through a hierarchy of spiritual forms (i.e., forms containing less and less matter) to the Active Intellect, which is an emanation of the deity. Many Muslim biographers consider Avempace to have been an atheist.
Avempace’s most important philosophical work is Tadbīr al-mutawaḥḥid (“The Regime of the Solitary”), an ethical treatise which argued that philosophers can optimize their spiritual health only in a righteous environment, which in many cases may be found only in solitude and seclusion. The work remained incomplete upon his death, but its conclusions can be ascertained from his earlier works. His other philosophical works included commentaries on the works of Aristotle and al-Fārābī. He also wrote a number of songs and poems and a treatise on botany; he is known to have studied astronomy, medicine, and mathematics.
