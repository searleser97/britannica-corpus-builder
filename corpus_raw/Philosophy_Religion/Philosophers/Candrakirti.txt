Candrakīrti,  (flourished ad 600–650), principal representative of the Prāsaṅgika school of Buddhist logic. Candrakīrti wrote the famous commentary the Prasannapadā (“The Clear Worded”) on the thought of the Buddhist sage Nāgārjuna. Although there were several earlier commentaries explaining Nāgārjuna, Candrakīrti’s became the most authoritative; it is the only one that has been preserved in its original Sanskrit (other commentaries are available only in Tibetan translation).
