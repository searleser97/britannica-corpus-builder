Heinrich Rickert,  (born May 25, 1863, Danzig, Prussia—died  July 28, 1936, Heidelberg, Ger.), German philosopher who founded the Baden school of Neo-Kantian thought in southwestern Germany and advanced an axiological approach to the Kantian theory of epistemology, allowing for greater objectivity in his metaphysical hypothesis of values.
After receiving a degree from the University of Strassburg, Rickert became a professor at Freiburg University (1894) and then professor at Heidelberg University (1916). In his work, Rickert sought to differentiate between physical and historical sciences. Emphasizing that history is dependent upon human value judgments of past experiences that cannot be verified by direct perception, he sought to objectify history through the use of a universally valid system of historical values. These were to be established epistemologically and grounded empirically in a cultural examination of individual social phenomena. Among his principal works are Kulturwissenschaft und Naturwissenschaft (1899; “Cultural Science and Natural Science”), Die Philosophie des Lebens (1920; “The Philosophy of Life”), and Die Logik des Prädikats und das Problem der Ontologie (1930; “Predicamental Logic and the Problem of Ontology”).
