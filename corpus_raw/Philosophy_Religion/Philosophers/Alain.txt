Alain, pseudonym of Émile-auguste Chartier,  (born March 3, 1868, Mortagne, Fr.—died  June 2, 1951, Le Vésinet, near Paris), French philosopher whose work profoundly influenced several generations of readers.
Graduating in philosophy, he taught at lycées in a number of towns, including Rouen, where he became involved in politics and began contributing a daily short article of 600 words to a Radical newspaper. The high literary quality of these articles soon attracted attention and they were collected and published (1908) in a book that came to be regarded as a classic. Appointed to teach philosophy at the Lycée Henri Quatre, in Paris, Alain became the mentor of most of the teachers of philosophy of the next generation in France. In defiance of public opinion he foretold and denounced World War I; on its outbreak, however, he enlisted in the artillery. Refusing promotion, he spent the whole war in the ranks; and it was in the front line or in battery telephonists’ dugouts that he wrote Mars, ou la guerre jugée (1921; Mars; or, The Truth About War, 1930), Quatre-vingt-un Chapîtres sur l’esprit et les passions (1917), and Système des beaux-arts (1920). Later he resumed his post at the Lycée Henri Quatre. His most important publications over the ensuing years were Les Idées et les âges (1927), Entretiens au bord de la mer (1931), Idées (1932), Les Dieux (1934), Histoire de mes pensées (1936), and Les Aventures de coeur (1945). When age and painful disease made it impossible for him to teach any longer, he retired to a little house in the neighbourhood of Paris, where his disciples could visit him. In 1951 he was awarded the Grand Prix National de Littérature, of which he was the first recipient; this was the only honour that he accepted.
