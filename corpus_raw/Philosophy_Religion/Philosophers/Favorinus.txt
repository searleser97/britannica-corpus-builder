Favorinus,   (flourished  2nd century), Skeptical philosopher and rhetorician of the Roman Empire who was highly esteemed for his learning and eloquence.
He was a congenital eunuch and is known to have lived in Rome, Athens, Corinth, and Ephesus. He was the teacher of Herodes Atticus, Gellius, and Fronto and was a friend of Plutarch. While in Rome, he held high office under Emperor Hadrian but, later, falling into disfavour, was exiled to Chios until the end of Hadrianâ€™s reign, at which time he returned to Rome and recovered his status.
Favorinus wrote philosophical discourses, declamations, a Miscellaneous History, and memoirs. His serene discourse On Exile was printed from a Vatican Greek papyrus in 1931. Only fragments remain of his other works.
