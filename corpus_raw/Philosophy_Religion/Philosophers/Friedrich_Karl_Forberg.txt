Friedrich Karl Forberg,  (born Aug. 30, 1770, Meuselwitz, Saxe-Gotha—died  1848, Hildburghausen, Saxe-Coburg), German philosopher and educator.
An exponent of the Idealist school developed by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Forberg is best known for his essay Über die Entwicklung des Begriffs Religion (1798; “On the Development of the Concept of Religion”), a work that occasioned Fichte’s dismissal from the University of Jena on the charge of atheism after he had published a corroborative treatise. Forberg also wrote further apologetical works in support of atheism.
