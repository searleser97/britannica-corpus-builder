Samuel Alexander,   (born Jan. 6, 1859, Sydney, N.S.W. [Australia]—died  Sept. 13, 1938, Manchester, Eng.), philosopher who developed a metaphysics of emergent evolution involving time, space, matter, mind, and deity.
After studying in Melbourne, Alexander went to Balliol College, Oxford, in 1877 on a scholarship. In 1887 he received the Green Prize for “Moral Order and Progress” (1889), an essay on evolutionary ethics. Alexander’s interest in evolution led him to relinquish a fellowship at Lincoln College, Oxford, in order to study (1890–91) experimental psychology under Hugo Münsterberg in Germany. In 1893 he became a professor at Owens College (later Victoria University of Manchester), where he remained until his retirement in 1924. He was awarded the Order of Merit in 1930.
As Gifford lecturer at Glasgow University, Alexander organized his philosophical thought into a comprehensive system published as Space, Time and Deity (1920), his only major work. It explains the world as a single cosmic process with space-time as the basic cosmic matrix. “Emergents” (Gestalt-like properties) periodically arise as higher syntheses. Space-time thus produced matter, and matter in turn gave rise to mind (or “awareness”) as a further, higher, qualitative synthesis.
“Deity” signifies the upper goal, the next higher level toward which the cosmic order spontaneously tends. In this hierarchy of change, the higher synthesis emerges from below but possesses genuinely new characteristics; hence in each instance the new synthesis is unpredictable. Alexander did not attempt to give an ultimate explanation for the world’s existence; he tried merely to explain the world in terms of spontaneous creative tendencies.
