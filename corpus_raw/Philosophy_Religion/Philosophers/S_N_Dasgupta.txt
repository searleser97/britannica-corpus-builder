S.N. Dasgupta, in full Surendranath Dasgupta,  (born October 1885, Kushtia, India [now in Bangladesh]—died December 18, 1952, Lucknow, India), Indian philosopher noted for his authoritative A History of Indian Philosophy, 5 vol. (1922–55).
Dasgupta received master’s degrees in Sanskrit and philosophy from Sanskrit College in Calcutta. During the early 1920s, he traveled to England, where he earned a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Cambridge. His other major works include Yoga as Philosophy and Religion (1924) and Indian Idealism (1933).
 His philosophical system synthesized aspects of Vedantic literature, Indian Jainism (particularly its mysticism), the British and American school of new realism, and the theory of emergent evolution.
