Pierre Duhem,  (born June 10, 1861, Paris, Fr.—died  Sept. 14, 1916, Cabrespine), French physicist, mathematician, and philosopher of science who emphasized a history of modern science based on evolutionary metaphysical concepts. He maintained that the role of theory in science is to systematize relationships rather than to interpret new phenomena.
Duhem studied at the Collège Stanislas and École Normale Supérieure before teaching at Lille and Rennes. As professor of theoretical physics at the University of Bordeaux (1894), he was also known for work in thermodynamics and hydrodynamics. Among his voluminous writings are Études sur Léonard de Vinci (1906–13; “Studies on Leonardo da Vinci”) and La Théorie physique, son objet et sa structure (1906; “Physical Theory, Its Aim and Structure”). In 1913 he began publication of Le Système du monde; Histoire des doctrines cosmologiques, de Platon à Copernic (1913–17; “The World System; History of Cosmological Doctrines from Plato to Copernicus”), which eventually comprehended 10 volumes; but only five were completed by the time of his death.
