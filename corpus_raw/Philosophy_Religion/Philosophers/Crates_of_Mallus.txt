Crates of Mallus,  (flourished early 2nd century bc), Stoic philosopher, from Mallus in Cilicia, primarily important as a grammarian. His chief work was a commentary on Homer. Leader of the literary school and head of the library of Pergamum, he was the chief representative of the allegorical theory of exegesis, maintaining that Homer intended to express scientific or philosophical truths in the form of poetry. Crates is said to have made one of the earliest globes bearing a map of the Earth, in about 150 bc. About 170 bc, he went to Rome as ambassador of Eumenes II, king of Pergamum; the lectures that he delivered there gave the first impulse to the study of grammar and criticism among the Romans.
