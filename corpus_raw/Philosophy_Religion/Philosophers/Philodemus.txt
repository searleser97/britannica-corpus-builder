Philodemus,   (born c. 110 bc, Gadara, Syria—died c. 35 bc, Herculaneum, Campania), Greek poet and Epicurean philosopher who did much to spread Epicureanism to Rome.
After studying under the Epicurean Zeno of Sidon at Athens, he moved to Rome c. 75 bc and became the mentor of the Roman aristocrat Lucius Calpurnius Piso, who invited Philodemus to live in his villa at Herculaneum, near Naples. In the ruins of that villa were found fragments of Philodemus’ writings. He was known for his theory of art, which contradicted classical doctrines of aesthetics. His fame rests largely, however, on his love epigrams in the Palatine Anthology, allusions to which are found in works by the later Roman poets Virgil, Ovid, and Horace.
