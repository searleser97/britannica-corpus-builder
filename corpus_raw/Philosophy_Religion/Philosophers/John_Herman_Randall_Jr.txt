John Herman Randall, Jr.,  (born Feb. 14, 1899, Grand Rapids, Mich., U.S.—died  Dec. 1, 1980, New York, N.Y.), American historian and philosopher who wrote a series of highly respected works on the history of philosophy.
Randall studied under historians Charles A. Beard and James Harvey Robinson at Columbia University, where he began teaching in 1921 and earned his Ph.D. in 1922. In his first major work, The Western Mind, 2 vol. (1924), revised and reissued as The Making of the Modern Mind (1926), Randall reconstructed the times and conditions, as well as the historical experience and traditions, that gave rise to certain philosophical systems. His Career of Philosophy in Modern Times, 2 vol. (1962–65), is an analysis of the historical context surrounding the 17th- and 18th-century assimilation of science into traditional interpretive frameworks.
In his Aristotle (1960) Randall again placed Aristotle’s thought into its own historical context and drew out its implications and relevance for modern man. His other works include The School of Padua and the Emergence of Modern Science (1961), The Role of Knowledge in Western Religion (1958), Nature and Historical Experience (1958), How Philosophy Uses Its Past (1963), Plato (1970), Hellenistic Ways of Deliverance and the Making of the Christian Synthesis (1970), and Philosophy After Darwin (1977).
