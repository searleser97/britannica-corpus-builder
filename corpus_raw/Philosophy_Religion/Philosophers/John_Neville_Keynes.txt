John Neville Keynes,  (born Aug. 31, 1852, Salisbury, Wiltshire, Eng.—died  Nov. 15, 1949, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), British philosopher and economist who synthesized two poles of economic thought by incorporating inductive and deductive reasoning into his methodology.
Keynes was educated at the Universities of London and Cambridge. After graduating from Cambridge (1875), he was a lecturer in moral science there (1884–1911) and then served as registrar of the university (1910–25). He also helped found a course of study known as the Economics Tripos.
Keynes’s most important contributions to economics were in logic and methodology. His first major work, Studies and Exercises in Formal Logic (1884), was popular for its clarity of expression and avoidance of mathematical symbolism. Keynes’s classic work on economic methodology, The Scope and Method of Political Economy (1891), categorized the existing approaches to economics as either inductive or deductive. With this book Keynes broke new ground by integrating the two approaches. At the time, the German-speaking world was engaged in the Methodenstreit (“battle of methods”) between the Austrian economic school led by Carl Menger, which advocated a deductive approach and stressed the importance of pure theory, and the followers of German economist Gustav von Schmoller, who advocated an inductive approach. Keynes, by contrast, insisted that both induction and deduction were essential components of sound economic analysis. He felt that inductive reasoning provided the general premises upon which deduction had to be based and that deduction resulted in generalizations or laws which then had to be tested by inductive procedures.
Keynes outlived his son, economist John Maynard Keynes, by three years.
