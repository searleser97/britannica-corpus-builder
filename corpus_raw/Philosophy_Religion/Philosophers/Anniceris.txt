Anniceris,  (flourished 4th and 3rd centuries bc), Greek philosopher who was drawn to the ideas of the Cyrenaic school of philosophy, founded by Aristippus, and to its basically hedonistic outlook. Anniceris dedicated himself to reviving some of the original principles of the school. During his lifetime the Cyrenaic school was undergoing a transformation, and two key figures responsible for this change were Theodorus and Hegesias. Anniceris differed from Theodorus in believing that pleasure had to be understood as embracing much more than sensual enjoyment. Anniceris differed from Hegesias, a pessimist, in believing that there are qualities of pleasure that are good in and of themselves, apart from their ability to assuage pain.
