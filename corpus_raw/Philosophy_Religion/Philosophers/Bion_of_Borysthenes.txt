Bion of Borysthenes,  (born 325? bc—died  255? bc), Greek philosophical writer and preacher. He was a freed slave and the son of a courtesan and has been credited with originating the Cynic “diatribe,” or popular discourse on morality, whose style may have influenced that of the Christian sermon. Few of his writings survive.
