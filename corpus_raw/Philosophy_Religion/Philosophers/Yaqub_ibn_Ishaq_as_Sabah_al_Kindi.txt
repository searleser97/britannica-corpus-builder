Al-Kindī, in full Yaʿqūb ibn Isḥāq al-Ṣabāḥ al-Kindī,  (died c. 870), the first outstanding Islamic philosopher, known as “the philosopher of the Arabs.”
Al-Kindī was born of noble Arabic descent and flourished in Iraq under the Abbasid caliphs al-Maʾmūn (813–833) and al-Muʿtaṣim (833–842). He concerned himself not only with those philosophical questions that had been treated by the Aristotelian Neoplatonists of Alexandria but also with such miscellaneous subjects as astrology, medicine, Indian arithmetic, logogriphs, the manufacture of swords, and cooking. He was also one of the instrumental figures, along with his contemporary Ḥunayn ibn Iṣḥāq, in the early movement in translating Greek philosophical and scientific works into Arabic. He is known to have written more than 270 works (mostly short treatises), a considerable number of which are extant, some in Latin translations.
