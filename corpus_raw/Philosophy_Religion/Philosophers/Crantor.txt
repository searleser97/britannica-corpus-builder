Crantor,  (flourished 4th and 3rd centuries bc, Cilicia [now in Turkey]), Greek academic philosopher whose work On Grief created a new literary genre, the consolation, which was offered on the occasion of a misfortune such as death. One of Crantor’s consolatory arguments, reminiscent of Plato’s Phaedo or Aristotle’s Eudemus, was that life is actually punishment; death, the release of the soul. He wrote the first commentary on Plato’s Timaeus, denying that Plato actually ascribed a beginning in time to the universe and its soul. Crantor’s writings are lost. He was a pupil of Xenocrates and the teacher of Arcesilaus.
