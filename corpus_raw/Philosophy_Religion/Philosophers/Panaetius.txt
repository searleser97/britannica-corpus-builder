Panaetius,   (born c. 180, –109 bc), the founder of Roman Stoic philosophy, and a friend of Scipio Aemilianus and of Polybius.
A pupil in Athens of Diogenes of Seleucia and of Antipater of Tarsus, Panaetius also studied the philosophies of Plato and of Aristotle. Many years a resident in Rome, he was an influential member of the Scipionic circle and was invited to be Scipio’s sole companion on an ambassadorial visit to the Orient about 140 bc. Panaetius succeeded Antipater as head of the school and passed the last 20 years of his life in Athens. While adhering to fundamental Stoic teaching, Panaetius tempered the rigid austerity of the ancient Stoa and introduced a new humanist note. He appears to have written less voluminously than other leading Stoics, and none of the five treatises attributed to him is extant. His important ethical treatise On the Appropriate was Cicero’s model for the first two books of the De Officiis. His chief disciple was Poseidonius of Apamea.
