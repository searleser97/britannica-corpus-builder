Zengzi, Wade-Giles romanizationTseng-tzu, also called Zengcan,  (born 505—died 436 bce), Chinese philosopher, disciple of Confucius, traditionally believed to be the author of the Daxue (“Great Learning”). In this classic, which became a part of the Liji (“Collection of Rituals”) and one of the Four Books during the Song dynasty, he discussed the great importance of the Confucian virtues zhong (“loyalty”) and shu (“deference”).
Zengzi was highly influential in reaffirming the Confucian emphasis on the virtue of xiao (“filial piety”). He enumerated the three degrees of filial piety: honouring father and mother, not disgracing them, and being able to support them.
