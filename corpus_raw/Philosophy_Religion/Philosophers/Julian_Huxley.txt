Sir Julian Huxley, in full Sir Julian Sorell Huxley,  (born June 22, 1887, London—died  Feb. 14, 1975, London), English biologist, philosopher, educator, and author who greatly influenced the modern development of embryology, systematics, and studies of behaviour and evolution.
Julian, a grandson of the prominent biologist T.H. Huxley, a brother of novelist Aldous Huxley, and the oldest son of the biographer and man of letters Leonard Huxley, was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. His scientific research included important work on hormones, developmental processes, ornithology, and ethology. He developed and headed the biology department at the newly formed Rice University in Houston, Texas, before serving in the British Army Intelligence Corps between 1916 and the end of World War I. He later became professor of zoology at King’s College, London University; served for seven years as secretary to the Zoological Society of London, transforming the zoo at Regent’s Park and being actively involved in the development of that at Whipsnade in Bedfordshire; and became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He is perhaps best known among biologists for coining the term “evolutionary synthesis” to refer to the unification of taxonomy, genetics, and Darwinian theory in the 1940s. He was the first director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1946–48. He was knighted in 1958. In 1961 he cofounded the World Wildlife Fund for Nature. A biography The Huxleys by Ronald W. Clark was published in 1968.
In 1919 Huxley married Marie Juliette Baillot, daughter of a Swiss lawyer, by whom he had two sons: Anthony Julian Huxley, who conducted valuable operational research on aircraft, became an authority on exotic garden plants, and produced the standard encyclopaedia on mountains, and Francis Huxley, who became a lecturer in social anthropology at Oxford.
