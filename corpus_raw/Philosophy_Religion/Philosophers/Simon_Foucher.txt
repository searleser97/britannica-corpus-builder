Simon Foucher,  (born March 1, 1644, Dijon, Fr.—died  April 27, 1696, Paris), ecclesiastic and critical philosopher of the Cartesian school, the first to publish criticisms of the philosophical theories of Nicolas Malebranche. In Critique de la recherche de la vérité (1675; “Critique of the Search for Truth”), Foucher reasoned to contradictory conclusions from the suppositions of a philosophical system. Granting with Descartes that interaction between mind and matter obviously takes place, he added, however, that likeness is essential for cause–effect relationships—which implies (as against Descartes) that mind and matter cannot be essentially different; or, conversely, if Cartesian principles were strictly followed, mind and matter could not possibly interact. Foucher likewise contended that Malebranche logically made every truth a matter of faith and failed to refute the arguments of Skepticism. For Foucher, discovering a criterion of truth was the goal of philosophy. He saw special value in academic Skepticism and in a reasonable doubt in the search for truth.
