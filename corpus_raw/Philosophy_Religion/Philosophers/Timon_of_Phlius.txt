Timon Of Phlius,   (born c. 320 bc, northern Peloponnese, Greeceâ€”died c. 230, Athens), Greek skeptic philosopher and man of letters.
Poor in his youth, Timon earned his living as a dancer before studying with Stilpo at Megara and with Pyrrhon of Elis. He acquired fame and fortune by lecturing and retired to Athens about 275 bc to write. Only fragments remain of his works, which included numerous prose works, tragedies, satyr plays, comedies, poems, and silloi, sarcastic attacks on dogmatic philosophers in mock-heroic hexameters.
