Pierre-Paul Royer-Collard,  (born June 21, 1763, Sompuis, France—died  Sept. 4, 1845, Châteauvieux), French statesman and philosopher, a moderate partisan of the Revolution who became a liberal Legitimist and the exponent of a realist “philosophy of perception.”
A lawyer since 1787, Royer-Collard supported the French Revolution in its first stages, serving as secretary of the Paris Commune from 1790 to 1792. He retired to Sompuis in 1793, when the moderate Girondins were overthrown. His election by the Marne département to the Council of Five Hundred (1797) was annulled by Napoleon’s antiroyalist coup of Fructidor 18 (September 4), and he joined the secret royal council, sending reports to the exiled Louis XVIII until 1803. For the next 10 years he devoted himself mainly to philosophy, becoming professor of the history of philosophy at the University of Paris in 1811. To refute the materialism and skepticism of the philosopher Étienne Bonnot de Condillac he developed his “philosophy of perception,” basing his system of knowledge through “consciousness” and memory on that of the Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid.
Royer-Collard was appointed supervisor of the press and counselor of state responsible for public education by Louis XVIII under the First and Second Restorations (1814, 1815). He also represented the Marne in the Chamber of Deputies from 1815 to 1842. He soon became a critical opponent of the more reactionary ministers, developing a Legitimist theory of constitutional monarchy. This, along with his philosophical program, made him the central focus of the Doctrinaires (moderate constitutional monarchists). Resigning his control of education in 1819 and dismissed from the Council of State in 1820, he became president of the Chamber in 1828. In March 1830 he presented the protest of 221 deputies against Charles X’s arbitrary appointment of Prince Jules de Polignac as prime minister. After the July Revolution of 1830 he remained in the Chamber, but as a Bourbon Legitimist he could not sympathize with the new regime of King Louis-Philippe and took no further active part in politics.
