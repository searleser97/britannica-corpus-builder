Alfred Korzybski, in full Alfred Habdank Skarbek Korzybski,  (born July 3, 1879, Warsaw, Poland, Russian Empire—died  March 1, 1950, Sharon, Conn., U.S.), Polish-born American scientist and philosopher.
During World War I, Korzybski served in the intelligence department of the Russian army general staff and in 1915 was sent on a military mission to the United States and Canada. With the collapse of the tsarist regime in 1917, he remained in the United States to serve as secretary of the French-Polish military mission, later becoming a U.S. citizen.
Korzybski was the originator of general semantics (q.v.), a system of linguistic philosophy that attempts to increase humanity’s capacity to transmit ideas from generation to generation (what Korzybski called man’s “time-binding capacity”) through the study and refinement of ways of using and reacting to language. His best-known work is Science and Sanity: An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and General Semantics (1933), a critique of traditional assumptions about language.
