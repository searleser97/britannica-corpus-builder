Hājjī Hādī Sabzevārī,  (born 1797/98, Sabzevār, Iran—died  1878, Sabzevār), Iranian teacher and philosopher who advanced the ḥikmah (wisdom) school of Islāmic philosophy. His doctrines—composed of diverse elements of gnosis (esoteric spiritual knowledge), philosophy, and revelation—are an exposition and clarification of the philosophical concepts of Mullā Ṣadrā. But he differed to some extent by classifying knowledge as an essence, rather than an outward quality, of the human soul.
After spending his early childhood in Sabzevār, a centre for Shīʿī and Ṣūfī studies, Sabzevārī was educated in Meshed, and in Eṣfahān, where he was first influenced by the teachings of the ḥikmat. On completing his studies, he returned to his native city, where he founded a madrasah (school) that attracted students of philosophy from as far away as Arabia and India. During his lifetime more than a thousand students graduated from his school.
The fame of Sabzevārī was such that Nāṣer od-Dīn Shāh, the fourth Qājār king of Iran, visited him in 1857/78. At the request of the Shāh, he wrote the Asrār al-ḥikmah (“The Secrets of Wisdom”), which, together with his Arabic treatise Sharḥ manzumah (“A Treatise on Logic in Verse”), remains a basic text for the study of ḥikmat doctrines in Iran. Not limited to philosophy, he also wrote poetry under the name of Asrār and completed a commentary on the Māsnavī of Jalāl ad-Dīn ar-Rūmī, the great mystic poet of Islām. Devout and pious, Sabzevāri led the ascetic life of a mystic. Miracles were attributed to him, and he is said to have cured the sick. On his death the Shāh ordered that a mausoleum be constructed for him in Meshed.
