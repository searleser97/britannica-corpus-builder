Plutarch of Athens,  (died 431/432 ce), Greek philosopher who preceded Syrianus as head of the Platonic school at Athens and who was one of the teachers of the Greek philosopher Proclus. Very little is known of Plutarch’s teaching; his commentaries on a number of the Platonic dialogues and on Aristotle’s De Anima have not survived and are known only from allusions by later writers; it is thus practically impossible to form any estimate of his importance. Although evidence would seem to suggest that his thinking was not notably different from that of other Neoplatonists of his day, it is said that he attempted to combine Aristotle’s psychology with the Platonic doctrine of recollection.
