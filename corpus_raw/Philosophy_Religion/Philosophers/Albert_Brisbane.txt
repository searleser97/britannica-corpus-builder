Albert Brisbane,  (born Aug. 22, 1809, Batavia, N.Y., U.S.—died  May 1, 1890, Richmond, Va.), social reformer who introduced and popularized Fourierism in the United States.
Brisbane, the son of wealthy landowners, received his education primarily at the hands of private tutors. At the age of eighteen, he went to Europe in order to study social reform with the great thinkers of his age. Disappointed with Guizot in Paris and Hegel in Berlin, he went on to study Turkish civilization in Constantinople.
Soon after his return to France in 1830, Brisbane discovered the works of Charles Fourier, whose advocacy of separate self-sustaining communities appealed to him. He studied under Fourier in France for two years and then returned to the United States in 1834. It was not until 1839, however, after a period of illness, that Brisbane actively launched his campaign to win converts to Fourierism.
He lectured and launched a Fourierist community, and his book Social Destiny of Man (1840) attracted widespread attention. Horace Greeley offered Brisbane space in the New York Tribune to elucidate the Fourier system—which Brisbane now called Associationism—and Brisbane’s columns soon spawned a number of Fourierist societies in the United States.
These societies (including Brisbane’s own) all failed, and the public lost interest in Associationism, though Brook Farm, which attracted several leading New England thinkers, is still recalled in historical works. While Brisbane never renounced his belief in Fourierism, he turned to other matters, including study, travel, and his numerous inventions. He was the father of the editor Arthur Brisbane.
