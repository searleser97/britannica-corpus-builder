Stephen Edelston Toulmin,  (born March 25, 1922, London, Eng.—died Dec. 4, 2009, Los Angeles, Calif., U.S.), English philosopher and educator noted for his study of the history of ideas. In his work on ethics, Toulmin was concerned with describing prescriptive language—that is, imperative sentences and value judgments used for ethical statements—while holding that ethics, or the logical study of moral language, cannot be reduced to subjective or objective facts but is a unique expression of duty or right.
Educated at Cambridge University (D.Phil. in philosophy, 1948), he lectured at Oxford before becoming department head and professor at the University of Leeds (1955–59) and then director of the Nuffield Foundation (1960–64). Moving to the United States in the 1960s, Toulmin taught at Brandeis University, Michigan State University, the University of California, Santa Cruz, the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Southern California. He is the author of The Uses of Argument (1958), Foresight and Understanding: An Enquiry into the Aims of Science (1961), Human Understanding (1972), The Return to Cosmology: Postmodern Science and the Theology of Nature (1982), Cosmopolis: The Hidden Agenda of Modernity (1990), and Return to Reason (2001).
