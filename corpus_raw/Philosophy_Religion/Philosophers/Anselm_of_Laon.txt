Anselm Of Laon, French Anselme De Laon,  (born  11th century, Laon, Archbishopric of Laon—died  July 15, 1117, Laon), theologian who became eminent in early Scholasticism.
Anselm apparently studied at Bec, Fr., under St. Anselm of Canterbury. In the final quarter of the 11th century, he taught with distinction at Paris, where with William of Champeaux he supported realism. About 1100 he returned to Laon, where his theological and exegetical school became famous. Peter Abelard attended Anselm’s school (c. 1114), and John of Salisbury referred to Anselm and Anselm’s brother Rudolph as “those most brilliant lights of the Gauls.”
Anselm was influenced by the Platonic and the Neoplatonic ideas transmitted by Bishop St. Augustine of Hippo. Anselm’s principal work was Interlinear Glosses, a commentary on the entire Vulgate Bible; it became a leading medieval authority. Some of his scriptural commentaries were ascribed to other writers, notably St. Anselm. His known works were published by J.-P. Migne in Patrologia Latina (vol. 162).
