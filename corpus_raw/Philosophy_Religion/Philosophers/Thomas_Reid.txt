Thomas Reid,  (born April 26, 1710, Strachan, Kincardineshire, Scot.—died  Oct. 7, 1796, Glasgow), Scottish philosopher who rejected the skeptical Empiricism of David Hume in favour of a “philosophy of common sense,” later espoused by the Scottish School.
Reid studied philosophy at Marischal College, Aberdeen, before serving as Presbyterian pastor at New Machar (1737–51). A lifelong interest in Hume dated from this period. His first critique of Hume, An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (1764), written during his tenure (1751–64) at King’s College, Aberdeen, was an amplification of four previous graduation addresses (first edited by W.R. Humphries as Philosophical Orations, 1937).
Lengthy studies convinced Reid that Hume’s Skepticism was incompatible with common sense, for both human behaviour and the use of language provide overwhelming evidence to support such truths as the existence of a material world and the retention of personal identity in the midst of continuous change. Unable to find fault with Hume’s argumentation, Reid settled on Hume’s “theory of ideas” as the prime source of error. Rejecting the notion that ideas are the direct object of the mind’s awareness, Reid substituted a view of perception in which sensations “suggest” material objects. For him, this ambiguous assertion solved the problem.
Reid’s Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man (1785) further extended his criticism of Hume’s epistemology, and his Essays on the Active Power of Man (1788) defended rationalistic ethics against a current of subjectivism. Both these books influenced British philosophers of the 20th century. The Works of Thomas Reid, 2 vol., edited by William Hamilton, were published in 1846 (8th ed., 1895).
