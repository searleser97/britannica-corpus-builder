Mīr Dāmād, original name Muḥammad Bāqir Ibn Ad-dāmād,  (died 1631/32, near Najaf, Iraq), philosopher, teacher, and leader in the cultural renascence of Iran during the Ṣafavid dynasty.
A descendant of a well-known Shīʿī family, Mīr Dāmād spent most of his life in Isfahan as a student and teacher. Mīr Dāmād’s major contribution to Islāmic philosophy was his concept of time and nature. A major controversy as to whether the universe was created or eternal had engaged the attention of Western and Islāmic philosophers; Mīr Dāmād was the first to advance the notion of huḍuth-e dahrī (“eternal origination”) as an explanation of creation. He argued that, with the exception of God, all things, including the Earth and other heavenly bodies, are of both eternal and temporal origin. He influenced the revival of al-falsafah al-yamanī (“philosophy of Yemen”), a philosophy based on revelation and the sayings of prophets rather than the rationalism of the Greeks.
Mīr Dāmād’s many works on Islāmic philosophy include Taqwīm al-īmān (“Calendar of Faith,” a treatise on creation and God’s knowledge). He also wrote poetry under the pseudonym of Ishrāq. As a measure of his stature, he was given the title al-muʿallim ath-thālith (i.e., “third teacher”—the first two being Aristotle and al-Fārābī). His work was continued by his pupil Mullā Ṣadrā, who became a prominent Muslim philosopher of the 17th century.
