James Lorimer,  (born Nov. 4, 1818, Aberdalgie, Perthshire—died  Feb. 13, 1890, Edinburgh), legal philosopher, proponent of a doctrine of natural law that was opposed to the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham, the positivism of John Austin, and the legal historicism of Sir Henry Maine. More influential in France and Germany than in Great Britain, Lorimer’s theory held that the natural law was founded on divine authority and revealed in conscience and in history. He was particularly concerned with the application of natural law to international relations. He was admitted to the Scottish bar in 1845, and in 1865 he became professor of public law at Edinburgh.
Among Lorimer’s major works are The Institutes of Law (1872), The Institutes of the Law of Nations (2 vol., 1883–84), and Studies National and International (1890). His writings are characterized by vigour and by flashes of prophetic insight, particularly his draft scheme (1870) for a “permanent congress of nations” and an international court of justice.
