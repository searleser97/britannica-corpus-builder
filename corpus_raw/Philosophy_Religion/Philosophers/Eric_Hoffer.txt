Eric Hoffer,  (born July 25, 1898?, New York City—died  May 21, 1983, San Francisco), American longshoreman and philosopher whose writings on life, power, and social order brought him celebrity.
Hoffer’s family was of modest means, and his early life was marked by hardship. A fall at the age of 7 left him partially blind until he was 15, when his eyesight returned. With the recovery of vision, Hoffer began to read voraciously. His mother had died when he was a child, and, when his father died in 1920, Hoffer, penniless, decided to go to California. For the next 23 years he found jobs as a migrant farm worker and a manual labourer; throughout this time he never stopped reading or lost his love of books, the only possessions he carried from job to job. He joined the longshoreman’s union in 1943 so that he could work only a few days a week and spend the rest of the time reading and writing.
His first book, The True Believer (1951), demonstrated his insights into the nature of mass movements and the people who compose them. It received critical acclaim from both scholars and laymen and catapulted Hoffer into the limelight. Later works included The Passionate State of Mind (1955), a collection of cogent aphorisms; The Ordeal of Change (1963), composed of essays dealing with human reactions to social and political upheaval; Working and Thinking on the Waterfront (1967); Reflections on the Human Condition (1972); and Before the Sabbath (1979). Much of his writing was in quotable piquant epigrams, showing the influence of M345054ichel de Montaigne, an essayist whom Hoffer admired.
The rarity of a self-educated scholar (he claimed to have had no formal schooling) as well as the novelty of a philosopher with a working-class background made Hoffer into a sort of popular hero. He continued as a dockworker until 1967, completing his books in between assignments. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States’ highest civilian honour, in 1982.
