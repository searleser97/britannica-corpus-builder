Francisco Sanches,  Sanches also spelled Sanchez,  (born c. 1550, probably Braga, Port., or Túy, Spain—died  c. Nov. 26, 1623, Toulouse, France), physician and philosopher who espoused a “constructive skepticism” that rejected mathematical truths as unreal and Aristotle’s theory of knowledge as false.
Sanches received a medical degree at Montpellier (1574) and taught philosophy at the University of Toulouse before becoming professor of medicine in 1612. In Quod Nihil Scitur (1581; “Why Nothing Can Be Known”), a famous skeptical tract, Sanches explained that true knowledge is impossible because sense faculties are unreliable and cannot reach the true nature of things; that, moreover, the world is in constant flux and (because all things are related) no one thing can be understood without understanding all other things, their causes, the causes of their causes, and so forth; and that reliable knowledge is exhaustive and belongs to God alone.
