Udayanacharya,  (flourished 10th century, near Darbhanga, modern Bihar state, India), Hindu logician who attempted to reconcile the views held by the two major schools of logic that were the sources of the Navya Nyaya (“New Nyaya”) school of “right” reasoning, which is still recognized and followed in some regions of India.
Of the two schools, the original Nyaya system was concerned with the critical examination of the objects of knowledge by means of logical proof, whereas the earlier Vaisheshika system dealt with particulars—objects that can be thought of and named. Udayanacharya assumed, with the Vaisheshika, that the world was formed by atoms, from which physical bodies also derived. But he was equally concerned with the mind and its right apprehension of objects in nature. He set forth his thinking in the Kusumanjali and the Bauddhadhikkara, the latter an attack on the nontheistic thesis of Buddhism. Living in a period of lively controversy with the Buddhists, Udayanacharya defended his belief in a personal God by resorting to the two natures of the world: cause and effect. The presence of the world is an effect that cannot be explained by the activity of atoms alone. A supreme being had to cause the effect and regulate the activity of the atoms; hence, according to Udayanacharya, God exists.
