Sir Robert Filmer,  (born c. 1588—died  May 26, 1653, East Sutton, near Middlestone, Kent, Eng.), English theorist who promoted an absolutist concept of kingship.
Filmer was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and at Lincoln’s Inn. He was knighted by Charles I and had a brother and a son at court. During the English Civil Wars his house in East Sutton was sacked, and he went to prison as a royalist although he never fought for the king.
During the exclusion crisis of 1679–80 Filmer’s political tracts (first published between 1648 and 1653) were reissued (1679) and his major work, Patriarcha, was published for the first time (1680). John Locke, then writing on politics, attacked his writings as “glib nonsense,” but 20th-century scholars have viewed Filmer as a significant and interesting figure in his own right, quite apart from Locke’s attention to him. He was the first English absolutist, for Patriarcha was written long before the Civil Wars and before Thomas Hobbes was published.
Filmer believed that the state was a family, that the first king was a father, and that submission to patriarchal authority was the key to political obligation. Making a strained interpretation of scripture, typical of his time but ridiculed by Locke, he pronounced that Adam was the first king and that Charles I ruled in England as Adam’s eldest heir. Filmer represented that patriarchal social structure which characterized Europe until the Industrial Revolution.
