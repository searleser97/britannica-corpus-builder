Émile Meyerson,  (born Feb. 12, 1859, Lublin, Pol., Russian Empire [now in Poland]—died  Dec. 4, 1933, Paris, France), Polish-born French chemist and philosopher of science whose concepts of rational understanding based on realism and causalism were popular among scientific theorists in the 1930s.
Educated in classical science and chemistry under Robert Wilhelm Bunsen in Germany, Meyerson emigrated to Paris (1882), where he became an industrial chemist, foreign editor for the Havas news agency, and, later, director of the Jewish Colonization Association for Europe and Asia Minor. Although he had no formal university connection, his erudite works—especially Identité et réalité (1908; Identity and Reality), De l’explication dans les sciences, 2 vol. (1921; “On Explanation in the Sciences”), and Du cheminement de la pensée, 3 vol. (1931; “On the Ways of Thought”)—convinced scholars that scientific philosophy is understood only by analyzing the history of science. He extended his views to such other areas as quantum theory, philosophical and primitive thought, and relativity theory, as in La Déduction relativiste (1925; “Relativist Deduction”).
