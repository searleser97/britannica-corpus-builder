Jacob Anatoli,  (born c. 1194, Provence [now in France]—died  1258), Jewish philosopher, preacher, and physician.
Anatoli was especially interested in the works of the 12th-century Arab physician Averroës’ and translated some of them from the Arabic. Anatoli probably shared Averroës belief that religion and philosophy move in similar directions, even though they are outwardly different in many respects, and further felt that religion symbolically expresses philosophical truths. Much of Anatoli’s original work was in philosophical homilies, a collection of which appeared in Malmad ha-Talmidim (“The Students’ Instruction”).
