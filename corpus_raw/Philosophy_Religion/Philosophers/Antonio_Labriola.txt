Antonio Labriola,  (born July 2, 1843, Cassino, Kingdom of the Two Sicilies [Italy]—died  Feb. 12, 1904, Rome, Italy), philosopher who systematized the study of Marxist socialism in Italy. The first in his nation to expound orthodox Marxism, he profoundly influenced contemporaries of diverse political persuasions.
A student of the Hegelian philosopher Bertrando Spaventa, Labriola became a philosophy professor at the University of Rome in 1874. His independent and critical mind, together with his gift for oral expression, made him an exceptional teacher as well as a brilliant scholar. First favouring the political right, he became increasingly disturbed by the corruption in Italian politics and by 1885 adopted a radical socialist philosophy. It was in 1889, in presenting a course on the philosophy of history, that he began his lectures on Marxism, the first in Italy.
Labriola began a correspondence with Friedrich Engels in 1890 and undertook the systematic study of the texts of Karl Marx and Engels, approaching historical materialism from a critical, analytical point of view. Shortly thereafter, his Italian translation of The Communist Manifesto appeared. Labriola’s writings include In memoria del Manifesto dei Comunisti (1895; “In Memory of the Communist Manifesto”), La concezione materialistica della storia (1896; “The Materialist Conception of History”), and Discorrendo di socialismo e di filosofia (1897; “Speaking on Socialism and Philosophy”).
