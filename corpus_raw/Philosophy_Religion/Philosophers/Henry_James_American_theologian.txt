Henry James,  (born June 3, 1811, Albany, N.Y., U.S.—died  Dec. 18, 1882, Cambridge, Mass.), American philosophical theologian, the father of the novelist Henry James and the philosopher William James.
A graduate of Union College, Schenectady, N.Y. (1830), James worked in business and law and then studied at Princeton Theological Seminary (1835–37). Although he was reared in a strict Presbyterian family, he was repelled by orthodox Protestantism and gave up adherence to institutional religion. He lived in Europe for several years, and while he was in England in 1844 he became acquainted with the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, which became the framework for his own philosophy. His best writings were compiled by William James in The Literary Remains of Henry James (1885).
