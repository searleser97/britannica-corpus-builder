Cleanthes,   (born 331/330 bc, Assos in the Troad, Asia Minor—died  232/231), Stoic philosopher who became head of the Stoic school (263–232 bc) after the death of Zeno of Citium. Among his pupils were his successor, Chrysippus, and Antigonus II, king of Macedonia. Although Cleanthes produced little that is original, he brought a religious fervour to the teachings of Zeno, stressing the belief that the universe is a living entity and that God is the vivifying ether of the universe. He wrote about 50 works, of which only fragments survive, the most important being his hymn to Zeus. The principal fragments of Cleanthes’ works are contained in works of Diogenes Laërtius and Stobaeus; some may be found in Cicero and Seneca.
