Dio Chrysostom, (Latin: “Dio the Golden-Mouthed”) , also called Dio Prusaeus (Dio of Prusa), or Dio Cocceianus,  (born c. 40 ce, Prusa, Bithynia—died after 110 ce), Greek rhetorician and philosopher who won fame in Rome and throughout the empire for his writings and speeches.
Dio was banished in 82 ce for political reasons from both Bithynia and Italy. He wandered for 14 years through the lands near the Black Sea, adopting the life of poverty advocated by the Cynics. With the death of the emperor Domitian his exile ended, and he made a new career as a public speaker and philosopher.
A collection of 80 “orations” with fragments of others survives, but some are dialogues or moral essays, and two are spurious. Four are speeches addressed to Trajan. In Olympicus the sculptor Phidias explains the principles he followed in his famous statue of Zeus, one passage being supposed by some to have suggested the German dramatist Gotthold Lessing’s Laocoon. In On Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, Dio compares the treatment of the story of Philoctetes by each of the named tragedians. Best known is the Euboicus, depicting country life on the island of Euboea, an important document for social and economic history. A patriotic Greek who accepted Roman rule, Dio typifies the revival of Greek self-confidence under the Roman Empire that marks the beginning of the New or Second Sophistic movement in the 2nd century ce. Dio was committed to defending the ethical values of the Greek cultural tradition. This commitment was reflected in his style, which was relatively sober and favoured ideas over formal elegance.
