Lucius Annaeus Cornutus,  (flourished 54–68 ce), Roman Stoic philosopher, best known as the teacher and friend of Persius, whose satires he helped to revise for publication after the poet’s death.
Cornutus resided mostly in Rome. He was banished by Nero (in 66 or 68) for having indirectly disparaged the emperor’s projected history of the Romans in heroic verse, and thereafter Cornutus disappeared from history. He wrote various rhetorical works in both Greek and Latin. His philosophical treatise Theologiae Graecae compendium (“Compendium of Greek Theology”), still extant, is a manual of Stoic etymological interpretation of popular mythology. Simplicius and Porphyry refer to his commentary on the Categories of Aristotle, whose philosophy he is said to have defended against an opponent named Athenodorus in a treatise titled Antigraphe pros Athenodoron. Excerpts from his treatise De enuntiatione vel orthographia are preserved in Cassiodorus. In the Middle Ages several critical works were falsely attributed to him.
