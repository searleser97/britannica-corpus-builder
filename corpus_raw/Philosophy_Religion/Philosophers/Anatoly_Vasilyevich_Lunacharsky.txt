Anatoly Lunacharsky, in full Anatoly Vasilyevich Lunacharsky,  (born November 11 [November 23, New Style], 1875, Poltava, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died December 26, 1933, Menton, France), Russian author, publicist, and politician who, with Maxim Gorky, did much to ensure the preservation of works of art during the civil war of 1918–20.
Deported in 1898 for his revolutionary activities, Lunacharsky joined the Bolshevik group of the Social Democratic Party and started to work on the editorial board of the Bolshevik journal Vpered (“Forward”). He disseminated Social Democratic propaganda and organized lectures for Russian students and political refugees in foreign countries. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Lunacharsky was arrested and imprisoned. In 1909 he joined Gorky on Capri, where, together with A. Bogdanov, they started an advanced school for a select elite of Russian factory workers, but Lenin’s opposition to this project quickly ended it. Lunacharsky was preoccupied with the place of religion in the Bolsheviks’ proposed new social order, and in 1909 he published a book titled Outlines of a Collective Philosophy.
In March 1917 he joined Lenin and Trotsky in Russia and was appointed peoples’ commissar for education. This position enabled him to preserve many historic buildings and works of art from wanton destruction. His interest in the theatre encouraged a number of dramatic experiments and innovations. In 1933 Lunacharsky was appointed Soviet ambassador to Spain. Of his many dramatic works, three were translated into English and collected in Three Plays (1923).
