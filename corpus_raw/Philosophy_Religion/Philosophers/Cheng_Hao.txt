Cheng Hao, Wade-Giles romanization Ch’eng Hao,  (born 1032, Henan province, China—died  1085, Henan), Chinese philosopher who, with his brother, Cheng Yi, developed Neo-Confucianism into an organized philosophy. Cheng Hao’s idealist school emphasized pure thought and introspection, while his brother’s rationalist school focused on illumination through investigation.
Cheng was interested in both Buddhism and Daoism as a young man. Later he studied Confucianism, passed his civil service examinations, and attained high office; but, because he opposed the radical reforms of the great innovator Wang Anshi (1021–86), he was dismissed from the government. He joined his brother in Henan province, and a circle of disciples gathered around them.
The Cheng brothers built their philosophies primarily on the concept of li—defined as the basic force, universal law, or truth underlying and governing all existence—an idea they brought to Neo-Confucianism from Buddhist and Daoist writings. While both agreed that exhaustive study of li was the best way to spiritual cultivation, Cheng Hao stressed calm introspection and taught that in their original state humans were united with the universe. His emphasis on meditation influenced the later idealist school of Neo-Confucianism founded by Lu Jiuyuan (1139–93) and Wang Yangming (1472–1529).
Very little of the writings of the Cheng brothers is still extant. Collected fragments of their writings have been gathered in the Yi shu (“Surviving Works”), the Wai shu (“Additional Works”), and the Cui yan (“Choice Words”). A more complete sample of Cheng Hao’s writing is available in the Mingdao wenji (“Collection of Literary Works of Cheng Hao”).  All the extant writings of the two brothers were collected in the Er Cheng quanshu (“Complete Works of the Two Chengs”), published in Chinese in 1606.
