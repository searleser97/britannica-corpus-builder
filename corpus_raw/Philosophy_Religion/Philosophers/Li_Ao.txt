Li Ao, Wade-Giles romanization Li Ao,  (born 772, Longxi [now in Gansu province], China—died 841, China), Chinese scholar, poet, and official who helped reestablish Confucianism at a time when it was being severely challenged by Buddhism and Daoism. Li helped lay the groundwork for the later Neo-Confucianists of the Song dynasty (960–1279), who systematically reformulated Confucian doctrine.
Although Li was a high official of the Tang dynasty (618–907), little is known of his personal life. He was apparently friends with or a disciple of the great Confucian stylist and thinker Han Yu, with whom he is usually linked. Unlike Han, however, who was vehemently opposed to Buddhism, Li was much influenced by it, helping to integrate many Buddhist ideas into Confucianism and beginning the development of a metaphysical framework to justify Confucian ethical thinking. Li is especially known for his insistence that the questions of human nature and human destiny were central to Confucianism, ideas that became the core of later Neo-Confucianism. Moreover, his quotations from the Daxue (“Great Learning”), the Zhongyong (“Doctrine of the Mean”), and the Yijing (“Classic of Changes”) helped bring recognition to these previously obscure works and led to their eventual enshrinement as part of the great body of Confucian Classics. Finally, for later Neo-Confucians, Li helped establish Mencius as almost the equal of Confucius.
