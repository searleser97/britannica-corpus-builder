William Ralph Inge,  (born June 6, 1860, Crayke, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  Feb. 26, 1954, Wallingford, Berkshire), British divine, Christian Platonist, and dean of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London. He was noted for his keen intellect and for his pessimistic views, which earned him the title “gloomy dean.”
Inge was educated at Eton and at King’s College, Cambridge. He became assistant master at Eton (1884–88), a fellow of King’s College (1886–88), a tutor of Latin and Greek and fellow of Hertford College, Oxford (1889–1904), and Lady Margaret professor of divinity and fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge (1907–11). By 1911, when appointed dean of St. Paul’s, he had already written several books, including Christian Mysticism (1899), Truth and Falsehood in Religion (1906), and Faith (1909), which were to become theological classics. At St. Paul’s, where he remained until his retirement in 1934, he became a national figure, and for 25 years he contributed to the London Evening Standard.
Of Inge’s dozens of books, probably the most important was The Philosophy of Plotinus (1918), a collection of his lectures. Outspoken Essays, 2 vol. (1919 and 1922), and Lay Thoughts of a Dean, 2 vol. (1926 and 1931), are also notable.
