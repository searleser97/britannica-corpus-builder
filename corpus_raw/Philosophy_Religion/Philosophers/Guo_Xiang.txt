Guo Xiang, Wade-Giles romanization Kuo Hsiang,  (died 312 ce, China), Chinese neo-Daoist philosopher to whom is attributed a celebrated commentary on the Zhuangzi, one of the basic Daoist writings.
Guo was a high government official. His Zhuangzizhu (“Commentary on the Zhuangzi”) is thought to have been begun by another neo-Daoist philosopher, Xiang Xiu. When Xiang died, Guo is said to have incorporated Xiang’s commentary into his own. For this reason the work is sometimes called the Guo-Xiang commentary.
Guo deviated from Laozi in interpreting Dao (“the Way”) as nothingness. As nonbeing, Dao does not produce being—that is, it cannot be regarded as a first cause. Guo thus maintained that everything produces itself spontaneously. The “self-transformation” of a thing as well as its existence is conditioned by other things and in its turn conditions them. Applying this general principle to human affairs, Guo argued that social institutions and moral ideas must be changed when situations change. Guo also gave a more positive meaning to the Daoist term wuwei (“nonaction”) by interpreting it to mean spontaneous action, not sitting still. In these points Guo deviated from original Daoism, but the result which he inferred from his conception of nonaction agreed with Zhuangzi’s thought. For Guo meant also that everything has a definite nature; if it follows its own way, it finds satisfaction and enjoyment; if it is not content with what is, and craves to be what it is not, then there is dissatisfaction and regret. The perfect person (zhenren) ignores all such distinctions as right and wrong, life and death; his happiness is unlimited.
