Gongsun Long, Wade-Giles romanization Kung-sun Lung,  (born 325, Zhao state [now in Hebei province], China—died  250 bce, China), one of the best known representatives of the Dialecticians, a Chinese philosophical school of the 3rd and 4th centuries bce whose adherents were concerned with analyzing the true meaning of words. The school had little influence after its own time until the modern period and China’s encounter with Western learning.
Gongsun Long is famous for the discourse in which he discusses why “a white horse is not a horse.” He explains that since the horse is white, it is a special kind of horse whose “form” is white; it is not the universal concept horse and hence is not a horse.
The Gongsunlongzi (“Master Gongsun Long”) is one of only a few independent works of ancient Chinese literature dealing with logic that has been at least partially preserved. Only 6 of its original 14 chapters survive.
