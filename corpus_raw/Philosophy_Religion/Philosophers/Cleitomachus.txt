Cleitomachus, also spelled Clitomachus, original name Hasdrubal,  (born 187/186 bc—died 110/109), Greek philosopher, originally from Carthage, who was head of the New Academy of Athens from 127/126 bc. He characterized the wise man as one who suspends judgment about the objectivity of man’s knowledge. He was the pupil and literary exponent of Carneades and asserted, against other philosophers, that Carneades never disclosed a preference for any epistemological doctrine. His 400 volumes, all lost, included On the Withholding of Assent, two popular introductions to Academy philosophy, and a consolatory letter to his compatriots on the fall of Carthage.
