Jean de Muris,  (born c. 1290, Normandy?—died c. 1351, Paris), French philosopher and mathematician who was a leading proponent of the new musical style of the 14th century. In his treatise Ars novae musicae (1319; “The Art of the New Music”) he enthusiastically supported the great changes in musical style and notation occurring in the 14th century and associated with the composer and theorist Philippe de Vitry, whose book, Ars Nova (1320; “The New Art”), gave its name to the style of 14th-century music.
De Muris was long believed to be the author of the important treatise Speculum Musices, an attack on these innovations now known to be by Jacques de Liège. De Muris, who taught at the Sorbonne, knew many of the great composers of his day and corresponded with De Vitry. Apparently he composed no music. In his treatise, translated in part in W.O. Strunk’s Source Readings in Music History (1950), he argues for the acceptance of divisions and subdivisions of musical metre, which were not recognized in earlier music theory but became common in musical practice and notation.
