Abram Moiseyevich Deborin, pseudonym of Abram Moiseyevich Ioffe,  (born June 16 [June 4, Old Style], 1881, Upyna, Lithuania, Russian Empire—died  March 8, 1963, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.), Russian Marxist philosopher who advocated Hegelian dialectics.
Born into a petit bourgeois family, he joined the Leninist Bolshevik movement (1903) before Georgy Plekhanov influenced his becoming a Menshevik (1907) at the University of Bern, from which he graduated in 1908. In 1917 Deborin returned to Lenin and was appointed to the Sverdlov University (1921), where he gained prominence as a teacher and editor of Soviet philosophy and where his theories of materialism gained approval. By 1930, however, his ideas were being denounced by the Stalin regime for “underestimating” Leninism and for “separating” philosophy from practice, and he was stripped of all key educational and editorial positions except for a minor role at the Academy of Sciences (1931–53). After Stalin’s death, he resumed writing on social thought with Sotsialno-politicheskiye ucheniya novogo i noveyshego vremeni, vol. 1 (1958; “Sociopolitical Doctrines of Modern Times”) and Filosofiya i politika (1961; “Philosophy and Politics”). Earlier important works include Lenin i krizis noveyshey fiziki (1930; “Lenin and the Crisis of Modern Physics”) and Filosofiya i marksizm (1930; “Philosophy and Marxism”).
