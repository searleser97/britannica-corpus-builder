C.E.M. Joad, in full Cyril Edwin Mitchinson Joad,  (born Aug. 12, 1891, Durham, Durham county, Eng.—died  April 9, 1953, London), British philosopher, author, teacher, and radio personality. He was one of Britain’s most colourful and controversial intellectual figures of the 1940s. He was a pacifist and an agnostic until the last years of his life, a champion of unpopular causes, and a writer of popular philosophical works, and he became widely known to the British public as an agile participant in the BBC Brains Trust program from 1941 to 1947.
As a student at Balliol College, Oxford, Joad formed the pacifist and socialist views that led to his conscientious objection during World War I and to his vigorous promotion of pacifism early in World War II. After 16 years in the civil service, he retired in 1930 to become head of the department of philosophy and psychology at Birkbeck College, University of London.
A staunch rationalist, cast in the mold of H.G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw, he had no particular philosophical originality, but in some 40 books he set forth the ideas of others with great clarity, in addition to expressing his own prickly opinions. Among his works are Guide to Philosophy (1936) and Guide to the Philosophy of Morals and Politics (1938). In his last work, The Recovery of Belief (1952), he outlined his new-found faith in a theistic system.
