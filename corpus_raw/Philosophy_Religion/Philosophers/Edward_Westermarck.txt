Edward Westermarck, in full Edward Alexander Westermarck,  (born Nov. 20, 1862, Helsinki, Fin.—died  Sept. 3, 1939, Lapinlahti), Finnish sociologist, philosopher, and anthropologist who denied the widely held view that early humans had lived in a state of promiscuity and instead theorized that the original form of human sexual attachment had been monogamy. He asserted that primitive marriage was rooted in the needs of the nuclear family, which he considered to be the fundamental and universal unit of society.
Westermarck was a lecturer in sociology at the University of Helsinki (1890–1906) and then professor of moral philosophy (1906–18) and professor of philosophy at the Åbo Academy (1918–30). He also was professor of sociology at the University of London (1907–30). Westermarck helped introduce the work of Adam Smith, Herbert Spencer, and other British thinkers into Finland.
Westermarck’s major interests were the history of marriage, the comparative sociological study of moral ideas and various human institutions, and the culture of Morocco. His first book was the influential The History of Human Marriage (1891), in which he advanced his ideas on primitive marriage and society. His most important work, however, is considered to be The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas, 2 vol. (1906–08), in which he proposed a theory of ethical relativity according to which moral judgments are ultimately based on emotions of approval and disapproval rather than on intellect. Viewing ethics as a sociological and psychological discipline, he denied the existence of general moral truths and the objective validity of moral judgments. He favoured an ethic that would examine moral consciousness but not establish rules for conduct. Westermarck’s other writings include Ritual and Belief in Morocco, 2 vol. (1926), and Ethical Relativity (1932).
