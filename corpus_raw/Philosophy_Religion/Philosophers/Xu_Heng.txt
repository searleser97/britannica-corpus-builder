Xu Heng,  (born 1209, China—died 1281, China), Chinese neo-Confucian thinker who became the leading scholar in the court of the Mongol ruler Kublai Khan (1215–94).
The Mongols reunited China after the fall of the Southern Song dynasty in 1279. After this event the intellectual dynamism of the South profoundly affected intellectual discourse and scholarship in Northern China, which had been conquered in 1127 by the Jurchen people. The intellectual system of the great Southern thinker Zhu Xi (1130–1200), whose interpretation of Confucianism established the first major school of the movement subsequently known as neo-Confucianism, attained dominance. Although the harsh treatment of scholars by the Mongol conquerors, who established the Yuan dynasty (1206–1368), dampened intellectual activity, outstanding Confucian thinkers nevertheless emerged throughout the period. Some opted to purify themselves by leaving the court of the non-Chinese rulers, hoping to preserve the Confucian Way for the future. Others decided to put their teaching into practice by becoming engaged in politics.
Xu Heng took a practical approach. Appointed by Kublai Khan as the president of the Imperial Academy and respected as the leading scholar in the court, Xu Heng conscientiously introduced Zhu Xi’s teaching to the Mongols. He assumed personal responsibility for educating the sons of the Mongol nobility to become qualified teachers of Confucian Classics. His erudition and skills in medicine, legal affairs, irrigation, military science, arithmetic, and astronomy enabled him to be an informed adviser to the conquest dynasty. He not only set the tone for the eventual success of the Confucianization of Yuan bureaucracy but also ensured that Zhu Xi’s interpretation of the Confucian Way would prevail. In fact, it was the Yuan court that first officially adopted the Four Books (Sishu) as the basis of the civil service examination, a practice that was to be observed until 1905.
