Max Black,  (born Feb. 24, 1909, Baku, Russian Empire [now in Azerbaijan]—died Aug. 27, 1988, Ithaca, N.Y., U.S.), American Analytical philosopher who was concerned with the nature of clarity and meaning in language.
Black studied at the Universities of Cambridge (B.A., 1930), Göttingen (1930–31), and London (Ph.D., 1939). He immigrated to the United States in 1940 and became a naturalized citizen in 1948. He taught philosophy at the University of Illinois from 1940 to 1946 and thereafter taught at Cornell University, becoming professor emeritus in 1977.
Black’s early interest in mathematics resulted in The Nature of Mathematics (1933), a study of the various historical conceptions of that field. Black was heavily influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein, and his interest in that philosopher’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus bore fruit in the comprehensive and highly regarded study A Companion to Wittgenstein’s Tractatus (1964). Black analyzed meaning in language in several volumes of essays, most notably The Importance of Language (1962).
