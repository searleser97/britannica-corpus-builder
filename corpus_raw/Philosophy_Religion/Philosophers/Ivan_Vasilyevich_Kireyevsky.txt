Ivan Vasilyevich Kireyevsky,  Kireyevsky also spelled Kireevsky,  (born March 10 [March 22, New Style], 1806, Dolbino, Russia—died  May 30 [June 11], 1856, St. Petersburg), philosopher, critic, and writer who was one of the leading ideologists of the Slavophile intellectual movement in Russia.
Born into an aristocratic family, Kireyevsky studied metaphysics in Germany in 1830. Upon his return to Russia he founded in 1832 a literary journal called Yevropeyets (“European”), which was banned by the government after two issues. In the ensuing half decade he was converted to Orthodox Christianity and lost much of the Western outlook of his youth. In 1845 he served as editor of the journal Moskvityanin (“Muscovite”) for three issues.
Together with A.S. Khomyakov, Kireyevsky in the early 1840s articulated the classic arguments of Slavophilism. He asserted that the Russian way of life was superior to that of the West and that Russia should follow its own path of development based on the monarchy, the communal spirit of medieval Russian society, and the sacred traditions of the Russian Orthodox church. Kireyevsky criticized the secular humanism of the West as having led to class conflict, social revolution, and a corrupt materialism.
