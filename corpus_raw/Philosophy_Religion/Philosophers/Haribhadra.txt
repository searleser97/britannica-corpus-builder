Haribhadra, also called Haribhadra Suri,  (flourished 8th century), noncanonical author of treatises on the Indian religion Jainism, known for his authoritative works in Sanskrit and Prakrit on Jain doctrine and ethics. Scholars are still uncertain of the extent to which he should be differentiated from a 6th-century Jain author of the same name.
Haribhadra was born into the Brahman caste in Cittaur, India, and received a thorough education in the Sanskrit classics. On adopting the Jain faith, he entered a Shvetambara (“White-robed”) order of monks. Haribhadra is best known for his Shaddarshanasamuccaya, which deals with six philosophical systems of India, and his various summaries of Jain thought and practice. He also wrote on logic and yoga and contributed to Prakrit narrative literature.
