Giambattista della Porta, also called Giovanni Battista Della Porta,  (born 1535?—died February 4, 1615, Naples [Italy]), Italian natural philosopher whose experimental research in optics and other fields was undermined by his credulous preoccupation with magic and the miraculous.
Della Porta founded the Accademia dei Segreti, which was later suppressed by the Inquisition, and in 1610 he took part in the reconstitution of the Accademia dei Lincei. He traveled widely in Italy, France, and Spain.
His major work is Magia naturalis (4 books, 1558; “Natural Magic”; 2nd ed., in 20 books, 1589), in which he treats the wonders and marvels of the natural world as phenomena underlain by a rational order that can be divined and manipulated by the natural philosopher through theoretical speculation and practical experiment. The work discusses such topics as demonology, magnetism, and the camera obscura (prototype of the camera), which made della Porta one of the pioneers in the use of the lens. His other works include: De furtivis literarum notis: Vulgo de ziferis (1563); Arte del ricordare (1566); Villae (1583–92), an agricultural encyclopaedia; De humana physiognomonia (1586); De refractione, optices parte (1593); Pneumaticorum (1601), which was augmented in the Italian translation (De’ spiritali, 1606) with a description of a steam engine anticipating that of Thomas Savery of 1698; Caelestis physiognomoniae (1601), a confutation of judicial astrology; and De distillatione (1609), containing various chemical discoveries.
