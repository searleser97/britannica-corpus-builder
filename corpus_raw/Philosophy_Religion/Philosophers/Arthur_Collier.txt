Arthur Collier,  (born Oct. 12, 1680, Langford Magna, Wiltshire, Eng.—died  September 1732), idealist philosopher and theologian remembered for his concept of human knowledge.
Collier was born at the rectory of Langford Magna. Educated at Pembroke and Balliol colleges, Oxford, he became rector at Langford Magna in 1704.
Like the idealist thinker George Berkeley, Collier denied that an external world exists independent of that conceptualized by a mind. In his major work, Clavis Universalis (1713; “Universal Key”), he argued that men dare not conclude that what seems to perception to be external is actually external, for such objects as hallucinations, which seem external, are admitted to be internal. The difference between a seen and an imagined object, Collier asserted, is not that the seen object possesses a quality of externality but that it is more vividly experienced than the imagined—a difference that he held to be insufficient proof that the seen object exists independently of the perceiver.
Extending his argument, Collier insisted that the very idea of an external world is self-contradictory. What men perceive, he said, exists only in relation to their minds. He did not claim that the mind is the cause of the ideas that it contains but rather that the existence of objects in the external world is dependent upon the mental state of the perceiver. Thus, he did not deny that external objects exist; he denied only that they exist independently of the mind. Such an attitude, according to Collier, is necessary in order to understand that everything exists only by way of its dependence on the one supreme substance, God. Outlined in his unpublished “Confession” of 1709, Collier’s metaphysics is interpreted theologically in his works A Specimen of True Philosophy (1730) and Logology (1732).
