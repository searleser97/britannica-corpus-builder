Susanne K. Langer, née Susanne Katherina Knauth,  (born Dec. 20, 1895, New York, N.Y., U.S.—died July 17, 1985, Old Lyme, Conn.), American philosopher and educator who wrote extensively on linguistic analysis and aesthetics.
Langer studied with Alfred North Whitehead at Radcliffe College and, after graduate study at Harvard University and at the University of Vienna, received a Ph.D. (1926) from Harvard. She was a tutor in philosophy from 1927 to 1942, the year of her divorce from the historian William L. Langer, whom she had married in September 1921. She lectured in philosophy at Columbia University from 1945 to 1950, and from 1954 to 1961 (after 1961, emerita) she was a professor of philosophy at Connecticut College.
In her best-known book, Philosophy in a New Key: A Study in the Symbolism of Reason, Rite and Art (1942), she attempted to give art the claim to meaning that science was given through Whitehead’s analysis of symbolic modes. Distinguishing nondiscursive symbols of art from discursive symbols of scientific language in Feeling and Form (1953), she submitted that art, especially music, is a highly articulated form of expression symbolizing direct or intuitive knowledge of life patterns—e.g., feeling, motion, and emotion—which ordinary language is unable to convey. In the three-volume work Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling (1967, 1972, and 1982), Langer attempted to trace the origin and development of the mind.
