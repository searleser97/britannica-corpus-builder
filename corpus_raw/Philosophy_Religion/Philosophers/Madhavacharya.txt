Madhavacharya, also called Vidyaranya,  (born 1296?—died 1386?, Sringeri, Kashmir, India), Hindu statesman and philosopher. He lived at the court of Vijayanagar, a southern Indian kingdom.
Madhavacharya became an ascetic in 1377 and was thereafter known as Vidyaranya. He was part author of Jivan-muktiviveka and Panchadashi, works of Vedanta philosophy; Dhatuvritti, a treatise on Sanskrit grammar; Nyaya-malavistara, a work on the Mimamsa system, one of the earliest orthodox systems of Vedic philosophy; and Parasharasmritivyakhya, an elaborate comment on the Parasharasmriti.
His younger brother Sayana, the minister of four successive Vijayanagar kings, is famous as the commentator of the Vedas. Sayana’s commentaries were influenced by Madhavacharya, who was a patron of the scholars collaborating in his brother’s great work.
