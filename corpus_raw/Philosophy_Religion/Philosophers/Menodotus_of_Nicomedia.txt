Menodotus Of Nicomedia,   (flourished ad 120), philosopher of the Skeptical school of empirical medicine, credited with elaborating the first scientific method of observation. Like many other physicians of the period, he considered medicine an art; this left him free to perfect his art while remaining a Skeptic. He also wrote against Asclepiades, who espoused Atomism and a theory of imbalance of corpuscles as the cause of illness. Some scholars think the voluminous writings of Menodotus, frequently mentioned by Galen, suggest two contemporary physicians of the same name.
