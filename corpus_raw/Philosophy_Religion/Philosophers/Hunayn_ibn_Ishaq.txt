Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq, in full Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq al-Ibādī, Latin name Johannitius,  (born 808, al-Ḥīrah, near Baghdad, Iraq—died 873, Baghdad), Arab scholar whose translations of Plato, Aristotle, Galen, Hippocrates, and the Neoplatonists made accessible to Arab philosophers and scientists the significant sources of Greek thought and culture.
Ḥunayn was a Nestorian Christian who studied medicine in Baghdad and became well versed in ancient Greek. He was appointed by Caliph al-Mutawakkil to the post of chief physician to the court, a position that he held for the rest of his life. He traveled to Syria, Palestine, and Egypt to gather ancient Greek manuscripts, and, from his translators’ school in Baghdad, he and his students transmitted Arabic and (more frequently) Syriac versions of the classical Greek texts throughout the Islāmic world. Especially important are his translations of Galen, most of the original Greek manuscripts of which are lost.
