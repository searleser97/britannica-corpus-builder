Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius,  (flourished ad 400), Latin grammarian and philosopher whose most important work is the Saturnalia, the last known example of the long series of symposia headed by the Symposium of Plato.
Little is known about his life; long identified with Theodosius, proconsul of Africa in 410, he is now thought to be instead the Theodosius who was praetorian praefect (commander of the praetorian guard) of Italy in 430. The Saturnalia, which is dedicated to Macrobius’s son Eustachius, purports to give an account of discussions in private houses on the day before the Saturnalia and on three days of that festival. Most of the conversation is devoted to a careful and respectful reading of the poet Virgil, who is treated as a master of philosophy and religion as well as of rhetoric and grammar. There is much nostalgia for Rome’s pagan past; Christianity, the dominant religion of the 5th century ad, is ignored (except, perhaps, for the name of the boorish character called Evangelus). Macrobius also wrote a commentary on Cicero’s “Somnium Scipionis” (“The Dream of Scipio”) from the De Republica. This is a Neoplatonic work in two books. Of a third work by Macrobius entitled De differentiis et societatibus Graeci Latinique verbi (“On the Differences and Similarities Between Greek and Latin Words”) only fragments remain.
