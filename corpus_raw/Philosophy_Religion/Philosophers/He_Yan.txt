He Yan, Wade-Giles romanization Ho Yen,  (born ad 193?, Nanyang [now in Henan province], China—died 249, Luoyang [now in Henan province]),  Chinese scholar who cofounded the philosophical movement qingtan (“pure conversation”), in which groups of scholars used Daoist terms and concepts to give new meanings to Confucian texts. They also utilized Confucian moral and social philosophy to politicize Daoist thought.
A child prodigy, He was taken at age seven into the house of a great general, Cao Cao, whose son, Cao Pi, founded the Wei dynasty (220–264) after his father’s death and banished He from the palace. After Cao Pi’s death, however, He returned to the court and became a high official.
He is best known for his scholarly works, especially his discussion of wu, or non-being. He considered wu to be beyond name and form, hence absolute and complete and capable of accomplishing anything. According to He, the true sage does not become a hermit in the typical Daoist tradition, but, by careful practice of wuwei, the avoidance of overbearing aggressive action, a man becomes capable of social and political achievements.
