Frederick Robert Tennant,  (born Sept. 1, 1866, Burslem, Staffordshire, Eng.—died  Sept. 9, 1957, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), English philosophical theologian, a powerful apologist with a wide range of interests who essayed a harmony of science and religion within an empirical approach to theology.
Tennant studied science at Caius College, Cambridge, and was ordained while teaching science at Newcastle-under-Lyme High School (1891–94), becoming lecturer in theology and fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1913.
In four early books Tennant discussed the concepts of sin (1902, 1912), the fall (1903), and miracles (1925). In the first volume (1928) of his chief work, Philosophical Theology, Tennant shows himself temperamentally and philosophically unsympathetic to mysticism and argues that justification of the claims of religious experience to reveal God requires an independently established theism, derived by a “laborious ascent” from such knowledge about the self and the world as is supplied by epistemology, psychology, and the natural sciences. Volume II (1930) describes this ascent and gives Tennant’s version of the argument from design. His bold endeavour to combine scientific and theological thinking was, however, overtaken by developments within both empirical philosophy and theology, where, on different grounds, claims for the reasonableness of Christianity were soon to be condemned.
