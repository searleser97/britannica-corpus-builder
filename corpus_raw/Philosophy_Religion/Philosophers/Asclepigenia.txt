Asclepigenia,  (flourished ad 430â€“485), Greek philosopher of the Neo-Platonist school, teacher, and lecturer.
After the death of her father, Plutarchus, Asclepigenia was active in perpetuating the eastern version of Platonism, in cooperation with her brother, Hiero. Upon the succession of Proclus as head of the school at Athens, Asclepigenia instructed him in the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. She also taught him the old mystic orgiastic rites and the theurgy, or miracle-working, which Proclus said she alone possessed, having learned it from her father, who confided it exclusively to her after acquiring it from Nestorius, her grandfather. Proclus allegedly profited so much from her instructions as to be able, according to Marinus, to procure the immediate intervention of the god Aesculapius to cure the daughter of his friend Archiadas.
Asclepigenia was still active when Marinus followed Proclus; and, as a teacher, she worked with several other women for the continuation of the school.
