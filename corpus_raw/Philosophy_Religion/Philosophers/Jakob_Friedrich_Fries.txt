Jakob Friedrich Fries,  (born Aug. 23, 1773, Barby, Saxony [Germany]—died  Aug. 10, 1843, Jena, Thuringia [Germany]), German philosopher.
Fries studied at Leipzig and at Jena, and he became professor of philosophy and elementary mathematics at Heidelberg in 1805. His attitude toward contemporary philosophies is set forth in Reinhold, Fichte und Schelling (1803; reprinted 1824 as Polemische Schriften [“Polemical Writings”]), System der Philosophie als evidente Wissenschaft (1804; “System of Philosophy as Intuitive Science”), and Wissen, Glaube und Ahndung (1805; “Knowledge, Belief, and Superstition”). His important Neue oder anthropologische Kritik der Vernunft, 3 vol. (1807; “New or Anthropological Critique of Reason”) attempted to give a new foundation of psychological analysis to the critical theory of Immanuel Kant, which he sought to reconcile with the philosophy of F.H. Jacobi. His System der Logik (“System of Logic”) appeared in 1811. In 1816 Fries accepted the chair of theoretical philosophy at Jena, but because of his liberal, nationalist views, he was deprived of his professorship. In 1824 he was recalled to Jena as professor of mathematics and physics, and in 1838 the right of public lecturing on philosophy was restored to him.
Among the most important works of his Jena professorate were the System der Metaphysik (1824; “System of Metaphysics”) and Die Geschichte der Philosophie (1837–40; “The History of Philosophy”).
