Menedemus Of Eretria,   (born c. 339 bc—died c. 265), Greek philosopher who founded the Eretrian school of philosophy.
During a military expedition in Megara, he began attending the lectures of Stilpon and later joined the school founded by Phaedo at Elis. He became the leader of the school and transferred it to Eretria, where it became known as the Eretrian school. An active participant in political affairs, he was forced into exile by his opponents and several years later committed suicide. He is not to be confused with Menedemus of Pyrrha, a member of the Academy in Plato’s lifetime.
