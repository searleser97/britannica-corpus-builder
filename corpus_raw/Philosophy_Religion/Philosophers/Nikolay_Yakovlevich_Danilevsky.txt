Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky,  (born November 28 [December 10, New Style], 1822, Obertse, Oryol Guberniya, Russia—died November 7 [November 19], 1885, Tiflis, Russian Georgia), Russian naturalist and historical philosopher, author of Rossiya i Evropa (1869; “Russia and Europe”), who was the first to propound the philosophy of history as a series of distinct civilizations. According to him, Russia and the Slavs should remain indifferent to the West and concentrate on the development of political absolutism, their own special cultural heritage—not necessarily better than but different from that of the West. Danilevsky was said to have “given Russian nationalism a biological foundation.” His ideas influenced Konstantin Leontev among Russian thinkers and, among Western philosophers, Oswald Spengler.
