Fyodor Ippolitovich Shcherbatskoy,  (born August 30 [September 11, New Style], 1866, Kielce, Russian Poland—died March 18, 1942, Borovoye Akmolinskoy oblast, Kazakhstan, U.S.S.R. [now in Kazakhstan]), Western authority on Buddhist philosophy, whose most important work was the influential Buddhist Logic, 2 vol. (1930–32).
Educated in comparative linguistics, Sanskrit literature, and Indian philosophy, Shcherbatskoy spoke fluently and wrote with ease in six European languages. He also possessed a mastery of Sanskrit that won him the respect of Indian scholars as well as those of Europe.
About 1900, while he was in Mongolia and India, Shcherbatskoy’s study of Buddhist logic and metaphysics, particularly the logic of the philosopher Dharmakirti, led to his first major work, Teoriya poznaniya i logika po ucheniyu posdneyshikh buddhistov (1903; “Theory of Knowledge and Logic According to the Later Buddhists”), which formed the basis of his great work on logic. The second part of the Teoriya, on perception and deduction, appeared in 1909. Shcherbatskoy served as professor of Indian literature at the University of St. Petersburg from 1904. He wrote another major work, Conception of Buddhist Nirvana (1927), in reaction to the Belgian scholar Louis de La Vallée-Poussin’s radical Nirvâna (1925). Other works include The Central Conception of Buddhism and the Meaning of the Word “Dharma” (1923).
