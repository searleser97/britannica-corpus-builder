Nachman Krochmal, also called (by acronym) Ranak,  (born Feb. 17, 1785, Brody, Austrian Poland [now in Ukraine]—died  July 31, 1840, Tarnopol, Galicia, Austrian Empire [now Ternopil, Ukraine]), Jewish scholar and philosopher; his major, seminal work, Moreh nevukhe ha-zeman (1851; “Guide for the Perplexed of Our Time”), made pioneering contributions in the areas of Jewish religion, literature, and especially history.
Krochmal was married at the age of 14 (according to a contemporary custom) and went to live with his wealthy father-in-law. For the next 10 years, he read voraciously in the works of such authors as Moses Maimonides, the celebrated medieval Jewish philosopher (whose Moreh nevukhim, or The Guide for the Perplexed, later inspired Krochmal’s own Guide); in Hebrew literature; in German philosophy, particularly the works of G.W.F. Hegel and Immanuel Kant; and in secular history.
During his lifetime Krochmal published only a few essays; his unfinished Moreh nevukhe ha-zeman was edited and published posthumously by the eminent Jewish scholar Leopold Zunz (1794–1886). Krochmal’s aim, like that of Maimonides before him, was to reconcile the traditions of Judaism with modern secular knowledge. In order to accomplish this goal, Krochmal believed that it was necessary to trace the Jewish spirit through its manifestations in history, literature, and religious philosophy. A major achievement of Krochmal’s book is that it shifted attention from Judaism as an abstract religion to Judaism as a process expressed through the activities of a people.
