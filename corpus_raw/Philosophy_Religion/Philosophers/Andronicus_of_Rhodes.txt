Andronicus Of Rhodes,  also called Andronicus Rhodius,  (flourished  1st century bc), Greek philosopher noted for his meticulous editing and commentary of Aristotle’s works, which had passed from one generation to the next in such a way that the presumed quality of the original texts had been lost and much superfluous material added to many of the major treatises. Andronicus studied the original texts to sift out extraneous material and arranged them in an order that he thought reflected the workings of Aristotle’s mind. After completing the editing, he wrote a treatise that covered four topics: a defense of his procedure, a biography of Aristotle, an exploration into the question of authenticity, and an examination of the Aristotelian system of thought.
