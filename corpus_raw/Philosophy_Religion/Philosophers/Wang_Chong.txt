Wang Chong, Wade-Giles romanization Wang Ch’ung,  (born 27 ce, Kueiji, China—died 100?, Kueiji), one of the most original and independent Chinese thinkers of the Han period (206 bce–220 ce).
A rationalistic naturalist during an age of superstition, Wang dared attack the belief in omens and portents that had begun to creep into the Confucian doctrines. He helped pave the way for the critical spirit of the next philosophical period and prepared China for the advent of neo-Daoism. Born into a poor family and orphaned at an early age, Wang did much of his reading in a bookstore. He held a few minor government positions, but during much of his life he taught in his hometown.
Accepting the original doctrines of Confucius, Wang opposed the contemporary, “debased” Confucianism. Dismissing teleology, he declared that natural things occurred spontaneously. Further, Wang rejected the notion that natural disasters were a response by heaven (tian) to human immorality, especially that of the ruler, the “son of heaven” (tianzi). A bad king, in other words, would not necessarily produce bad weather. He stated that human beings, though noble and intelligent, had no exceptional position in the cosmos. A rationalist, he insisted upon the necessity of supporting any theory with concrete evidence and experimental proof.
Wang has never been greatly popular in China, though in the 20th century the prevailing critical spirit, scientific method, and revolt against the past attracted new attention to his ideas. His outstanding work, the trenchant and critical Lunheng (“Disquisitions”), written about 85 ce, was translated into English by Alfred Forke (2 vol., 1907–11).
