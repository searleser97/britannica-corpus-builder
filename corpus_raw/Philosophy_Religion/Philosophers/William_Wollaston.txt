William Wollaston,  (born March 26, 1659, Coton Clanford, Staffordshire, Eng.—died  Oct. 29, 1724, London), British Rationalist philosopher and moralist whose ethical doctrines influenced subsequent philosophy as well as that of his own time.
After studies at the University of Cambridge, Wollaston became a schoolteacher in Birmingham (1682) and soon afterward was ordained a priest. In 1688 he inherited the major part of his family’s fortune from a cousin and was able to move to London to devote his life to scholarship and philosophy. There he and his wife lived a secluded life among a few friends; he wrote prolifically, but his exaggerated standards of taste caused him to destroy many of his manuscripts. His penchant for literary elegance is evident from his major work, The Religion of Nature Delineated (1724).
Though some critics have seen seeds of some 20th-century ethical theories in his views, his theism was subjected to severe attacks by the end of the 18th century, notably by David Hume in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779).
