Hermann Cohen,  (born July 4, 1842, Coswig, Anhalt—died  April 4, 1918, Berlin), German-Jewish philosopher and founder of the Marburg school of neo-Kantian philosophy, which emphasized “pure” thought and ethics rather than metaphysics.
Cohen was the son of a cantor, and he studied at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau and at the University of Berlin before receiving his Ph.D. at the University of Halle in 1865. In 1873 he was appointed a Privatdozent (lecturer) at the University of Marburg, where he found favour and was made professor within three years. There he taught until 1912, developing the principles of his Marburg, or logistic, neo-Kantian philosophy.
Upon his retirement from Marburg at the age of 70, Cohen went to Berlin, where he taught Jewish philosophy in the liberal environment of the Institute for the Science of Judaism. At Berlin he went through a substantial change in his thinking about the relationship between God and man and came to believe that reality is rooted in God rather than in human reason. This worked a radical effect on Cohen, and he turned to religion and to his ancestral Jewish faith.
Between 1902 and 1912 he published the three parts of his Marburg philosophical system: Logik der reinen Erkenntnis (1902; “The Logic of Pure Intelligence”), Die Ethik des reinen Willens (1904; “The Ethics of Pure Will”), and Ästhetik des reinen Gefühls (1912; “The Aesthetics of Pure Feeling”). A work that expresses the shift in his thinking from man-centred to God-centred is Die Religion der Vernunft aus den Quellen des Judentums (1919; Religion of Reason: Out of the Sources of Judaism).
