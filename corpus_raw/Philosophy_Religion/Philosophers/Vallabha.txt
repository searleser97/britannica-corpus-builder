Vallabha, also called Vallabhacharya,  (born 1479?, Chaudanagar, near Raipur [now in Chhattisgarh state], India—died 1531, Benares [now Varanasi]), Hindu philosopher and founder of the important Vallabhacharya (or Vallabha Sampradaya) devotional sect, also known as the Pushtimarg (from Sanskrit pushtimarga, “way of flourishing”).
Born to a Telegu Brahman family, Vallabha showed precocity in spiritual and intellectual matters from an early age. He initiated his first disciple in 1493 at Mathura, which became the centre of his activities, though he undertook several pilgrimages throughout India, propagating his doctrine of bhakti (devotion) to the god Krishna. It was near Mathura, at the foot of Mount Govardhana, that Vallabha discovered the central devotional object of the sect, an image of Krishna called Shri-Nathaji.
Vallabhacharya (acarya, “teacher”) himself belonged to the Rudra sect established by Vishnusvamin, and his philosophical system of pure nondualism (shuddhadvaita)—i.e., the identity of God and the universe—closely follows that of the Vishnusvamin tradition. God is worshipped not by fasting and physical austerities but by love of him and of the universe. Salvation arises only by virtue of the grace of God. In order to receive divine love, the devotee must surrender himself wholly (samarpana) to God’s gift of love.
Vallabha was married and had two sons, though he became a sannyasi (ascetic) shortly before his death. His son Vitthala succeeded him as head of the Vallabhacharya sect.
