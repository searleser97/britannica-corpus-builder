Yi Saek,  (born 1328—died 1396), , Korean literary figure and Neo-Confucian scholar. Patronized by kings during the Koryo period (918–1392), he promoted an educational system based on the Confucian texts and was responsible for establishing a Confucian tradition of public mourning. While favoring Confucianism in public matters, he was sympathetic to Ch’an (Son, see Zen) Buddhist scriptures and practices. Toward the end of his life he was the revered head of the Confucian National Academy. He is remembered as one of the “Three Hermit Scholars” who were loyal to Confucian principles and were exiled by Yi Song-gye, the military leader who overthrew the Koryo regime.
