Stilpōn, also spelled Stilpo,  (flourished c. 380–300 bc), Greek philosopher of the Megarian school founded by Euclid (fl. about 300 bc) of Megara, Greece. Most of the Megarian philosophers are better known for the high value they placed on dialectical skill and for their influence on Stoic logic than for positive ethical assertions of their own.
Unfortunately, nothing of Stilpōn’s dialogues has survived, except for a few fragments that were quoted by other authors. Among Stilpōn’s best known pupils was Zeno of Citium, founder of Stoicism.
