Muro Kyūsō,  (born March 29, 1658, Edo [now Tokyo], Japan—died  Sept. 11, 1734, Edo), noted Japanese Confucian scholar who, as a leading government official, helped propagate the philosophy of the famous Chinese Confucian thinker Zhu Xi (1130–1200). Muro interpreted Zhu Xi’s emphasis on loyalty to one’s ruler to mean loyalty to the Tokugawa shogun, the hereditary military dictator of Japan, rather than loyalty to the Japanese emperor, whom the shogun had relegated to no more than a symbolic role in the Japanese government. Muro thus helped establish the philosophical underpinning to the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867).
The son of a physician, Muro acquired his own belief in Zhu Xi only after prolonged and intense personal struggle. He was appointed to high office by the reformist shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune (reigned 1716–45) at a time when unorthodox views had become widely prevalent and the shogun’s role in the government had begun to be questioned. Muro helped enforce orthodox thought, emphasizing the necessity of righteous behaviour, including duty to parents and to the shogun. Moreover, in keeping with the Confucian bias against commerce, he attempted to slow the rapid social and economic changes occurring in Japan.
