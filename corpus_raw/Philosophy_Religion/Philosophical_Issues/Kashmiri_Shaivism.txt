Kashmiri Shaivism, also called Pratyabhijna (Sanskrit: “Recognition”),  religious and philosophical system of India that worships the god Shiva as the supreme reality. The school is idealistic and monistic, as contrasted with the realistic and dualistic school of Shaiva-siddhanta.
The principal texts of the school are the Shiva-sutra, said to have been revealed to Vasugupta; Vasugupta’s Spanda-karika (“Verses on Activity”), 8th–9th century; Utpala’s Pratyabhijna-shastra (“Manual on Recognition”), c. 900; Abhinavagupta’s Paramarthasara (“The Essence of the Highest Truth”), Pratyabhijna-vimarshini (“Reflections on Recognition”), and Tantraloka (“Lights on the Doctrine”), 10th century; and Kshemaraja’s Shiva-sutra-vimarshini (“Reflections on the Aphorisms on Shiva”).
Shiva is seen as the sole reality and both the material and efficient cause of the universe. His power is known in five aspects: chit (“consciousness”), ananda (“bliss”), icha (“desire”), jnana (“knowledge”), and kriya (“action”). For the adherents of Kashmiri Shaivism, liberation (moksha) comes about through intense meditation on Shiva as the supreme reality and recognition of the supreme reality’s identity with the individual soul.
