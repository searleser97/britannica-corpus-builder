Contradictories and contraries,  in syllogistic, or traditional, logic, two basically different forms of opposition that can obtain between two categorical propositions or statements formed from the same terms.
Two categorical propositions are contradictories if they are opposed in both quantity and quality; i.e., if one is universal (“every”) and the other particular (“some”) and one an affirmation and the other a denial. For example, “Every S is P” and “Some S is not P” are contradictories. Some theories of logic consider not only oppositions between propositions but also oppositions between terms (“well” and “not well”; “moral” and “immoral”) as contradictories.
Two universal categorical propositions with the same subject and predicate are contraries if one is an affirmation and the other a denial. Contraries are of the form “Every S is P” and “No S is P.”
Contraries may both be false but cannot both be true. Contradictories are such that one of them is true if and only if the other is false.
