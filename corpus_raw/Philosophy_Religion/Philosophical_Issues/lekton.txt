Lekton, (Greek: “saying”) plural lekta,  in syllogistic logic, the sense or meaning of a proposition. The distinction between the language and the actual contents, or lekta, of sentences was a key discovery of the Stoic school of philosophy. It recognized, in effect, that such sentences as “John Smith is a boy,” “Johnny Smith is a lad,” and “Jean Smith est un garçon” could have an identical meaning. Thus, logic is concerned with relationships of meaning and not with the mechanics of communication.
