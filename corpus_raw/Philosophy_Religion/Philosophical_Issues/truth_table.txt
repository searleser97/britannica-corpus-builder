Truth table,  in logic, chart that shows the truth-value of one or more compound propositions for every possible combination of truth-values of the propositions making up the compound ones. It can be used to test the validity of arguments. Every proposition is assumed to be either true or false and the truth or falsity of each proposition is said to be its truth-value. Each row of the table represents a possible combination of truth-values for the compound propositions of the compound, and there should be enough rows to cover all possible combinations. For example, if the compound contains just two component propositions, there will be four possibilities and thus four rows to the table. The truth-value of the compound is indicated on each row under the truth functional operator. The table for “p or q” would appear thus (the sign ∨ standing for “or”):
This shows that “p or q” is false only when both p and q are false. Truth tables for compounds of great complexity having more than one truth functional operator can be constructed by computers.
