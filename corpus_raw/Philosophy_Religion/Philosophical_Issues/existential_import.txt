Existential import,  in syllogistic, the logical implication by a universal proposition (i.e., a proposition of the form “All S is P” or “No S is P”) of the corresponding particular statement (i.e., “Some S is P” or “Some S is not P,” respectively). The validity of some syllogistic figures (see syllogism) depends on whether universal statements are interpreted as having existential import.
