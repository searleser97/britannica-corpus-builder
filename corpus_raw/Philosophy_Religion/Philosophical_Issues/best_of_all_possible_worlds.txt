Best of all possible worlds,  in the philosophy of the early modern philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), the thesis that the existing world is the best world that God could have created.
Leibniz’s argument for the doctrine of the best of all possible worlds, now commonly called Leibnizian optimism, is presented in its fullest form in his work Théodicée (1710; Theodicy), which was devoted to defending the justness of God (see theodicy). The argument thus constitutes Leibniz’s solution to the problem of evil, or the apparent contradiction between the assumption that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent (perfectly good) and the evident fact of evil (including sin and unmerited suffering) in the world. In rough outline, the argument proceeds as follows:
Against the claim that, because the number of possible worlds is infinite, there is no single possible world that is best (for any given good world, there will always be another world that is better), Leibniz argued that, if there were no best possible world, then God would not have had a sufficient reason to create one world rather than another, and so he would not have created any world at all. But he did create a world, the existing one, which therefore must be the best possible.
Against the claim that the existing world is not the best of all possible worlds because it is easy to imagine a world that has less evil in it, Leibniz argued that it is questionable whether a world with less evil really is imaginable. Because of the interconnectedness of events, it could be that any world that does not contain the evil of the existing world would necessarily contain other, greater forms of evil. Furthermore, it could be that the existing world, despite the evident evil in it, is actually the best possible according to a divine standard of goodness that differs from ordinary conceptions of that notion.
Voltaire’s Candide (1759) was a satirical rejection of Leibniz’s optimistic view of the world.
