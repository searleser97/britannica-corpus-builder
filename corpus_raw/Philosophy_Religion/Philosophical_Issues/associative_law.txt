Associative law,  in mathematics, either of two laws relating to number operations of addition and multiplication, stated symbolically: a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c, and a(bc) = (ab)c; that is, the terms or factors may be associated in any way desired. While associativity holds for ordinary arithmetic with real or imaginary numbers, there are certain applications—such as nonassociative algebras—in which it does not hold. See also commutative law; distributive law.
