Sorites,   in syllogistic, or traditional, logic, a chain of successive syllogisms—or units of argument that pass from two premises (a major and then a minor) to a conclusion—in the first figure (i.e., with the middle, or repeated, term as the subject of the major and the predicate of the minor premise)—so related that either the conclusion of each (except the last) is the minor premise of the next or the conclusion of each (except the last) is the major premise of the next. If, then, the conclusions of all of the successive syllogisms (except the last) are suppressed and only the remaining premises and the final conclusion are stated, the resulting argument is a valid inference from the stated premises. For example:
In general, there may be n + 1 premises, and analysis then yields a chain of n successive syllogisms.
