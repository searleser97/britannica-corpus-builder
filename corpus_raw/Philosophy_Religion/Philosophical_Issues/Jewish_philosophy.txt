Jewish philosophy,  any of various kinds of reflective thought engaged in by those identified as being Jews. A brief treatment of Jewish philosophy follows. For full treatment, see Judaism: Jewish philosophy.
In the Middle Ages, Jewish philosophy encompassed any methodical and disciplined thought pursued by Jews, whether on specifically Judaic themes or not. In modern times, philosophers who do not discuss Judaism are not ordinarily classified as Jewish philosophers.
Philosophy arose in Judaism under Greek influence, though a philosophical approach may be discerned in early Jewish religious works apparently uninfluenced by the Greeks. From the Bible, the books of Job and Ecclesiastes were favourite works of medieval philosophers; the book of Proverbs introduces the concept of Wisdom (á¸¤okhma), which was to have primordial significance for Jewish philosophical thought; and the Wisdom of Solomon had considerable influence on Christian theology. Major figures of Jewish philosophy include Philo Judaeus, Saadia ben Joseph, Moses Maimonides, and Benedict de Spinoza.
