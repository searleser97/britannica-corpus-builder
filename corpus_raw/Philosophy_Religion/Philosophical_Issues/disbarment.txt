Disbarment,   the process whereby an attorney is deprived of his license or privileges for failure to carry out his practice in accordance with established standards. Temporary suspension may be employed if some lesser punishment is warranted.
Grounds for disbarment vary considerably from country to country, but, in general, conviction of an attorney for a major crime or a felony or his inability to account for a client’s funds entrusted to him constitute the major reasons.
The procedures for disbarment also vary from country to country. In some countries the bar association upon receipt of a complaint will hold a hearing. If the committee decides that the evidence is sufficient for disbarment or other punishment, it will make such a recommendation to the appropriate court. This court will then hear the evidence and the committee’s recommendations and make its decision. In some countries—Israel, for example—the bar organizations are themselves empowered to deal with these matters in their totality. In England the Inns of Court (the governing body of barristers) and the Law Society (the governing body of solicitors) both have the power to remove the attorneys within their respective organizations from the rolls.
