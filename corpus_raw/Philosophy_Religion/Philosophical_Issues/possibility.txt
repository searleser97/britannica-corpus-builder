Possibility,  in logic and metaphysics, one of the fundamental modalities involved in the explication of the opposition between necessity and contingency. In logic, possibility implies the absence of a contradiction. Such definitions as “The possible is that which either is or will be true” and “that which is not prevented by anything from happening even if it does not happen” were current in Hellenistic Greece. According to Aristotle, possibility is to be understood in relation to necessity: whereas a necessary proposition predicates something of a thing’s essence (as in “All humans are mortal”), a possible proposition predicates something of a thing that is merely accidental (as in “Some humans are tall”). Some philosophers have held that possible things or states of affairs are simply those whose conception involves no contradiction. To determine the empirical possibility of a thing, according to Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), it must be ascertained whether the nature of the thing in question conforms to the conditions of actual experience. The American philosopher David Lewis (1941–2001) held that there are possible but nonactual things, the largest of which are nonactual worlds. The actual world together with the infinite number of possible but nonactual words constitute the realm of  “possible worlds.”
