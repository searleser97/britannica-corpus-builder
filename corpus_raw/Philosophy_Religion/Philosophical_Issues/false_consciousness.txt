False consciousness,  in philosophy, particularly within critical theory and other Marxist schools and movements, the notion that members of the proletariat unwittingly misperceive their real position in society and systematically misunderstand their genuine interests within the social relations of production under capitalism. False consciousness denotes people’s inability to recognize inequality, oppression, and exploitation in a capitalist society because of the prevalence within it of views that naturalize and legitimize the existence of social classes.
Despite its close assocation with Marxism, the term false consciousness was never used by Karl Marx. The first treatment of false consciousness as a theoretical concept occurred in History and Class Consciousness (1923) by the Hungarian philosopher and literary critic György Lukács. The concept was further developed in the 20th century by Marxist scholars such as the German-born American philosopher Herbert Marcuse and the French sociologist Henri Lefebvre. Since the late 20th century the concept has been utilized outside explicitly Marxist theorizing in studies of oppression on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and race.
