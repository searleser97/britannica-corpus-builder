Pyrrhonism,  philosophy of Skepticism derived from Pyrrho of Elis (c. 370–c. 272 bce), generally regarded as the founder of ancient Skepticism. He identified as wise men those who suspend judgment (practice epochē) and take no part in the controversy regarding the possibility of certain knowledge. He proposed the neutral position of accepting things as they appear without further analysis. Pyrrhonism profoundly influenced philosophical thought in 17th-century Europe with the republication of the Skeptical works of Sextus Empiricus, who had codified Greek Skepticism about the turn of the 3rd century ce, and its force has resounded to the present day.
