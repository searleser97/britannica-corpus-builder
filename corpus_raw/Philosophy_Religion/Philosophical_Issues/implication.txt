Implication,   in logic, a relationship between two propositions in which the second is a logical consequence of the first. In most systems of formal logic, a broader relationship called material implication is employed, which is read “If A, then B,” and is denoted by A ⊃ B or A → B. The truth or falsity of the compound proposition A ⊃ B depends not on any relationship between the meanings of the propositions but only on the truth-values of A and B; A ⊃ B is false when A is true and B is false, and it is true in all other cases. Equivalently, A ⊃ B is often defined as ∼(A·∼B) or as ∼A∨B (in which ∼ means “not,” · means “and,” and ∨ means “or”). This way of interpreting ⊃ leads to the so-called paradoxes of material implication: “grass is red ⊃ ice is cold” is a true proposition according to this definition of ⊃.
In an attempt to construct a formal relationship more closely akin to the intuitive notion of implication, Clarence Irving Lewis, known for his conceptual pragmatism, introduced in 1932 the notion of strict implication. Strict implication was defined as ∼♦(A·∼B), in which ♦ means “is possible” or “is not self-contradictory.” Thus A strictly implies B if it is impossible for both A and ∼B to be true. This conception of implication is based upon the meanings of the propositions, not merely upon their truth or falsity.
Finally, in intuitionistic mathematics and logic, a form of implication is introduced that is primitive (not defined in terms of other basic connectives): A ⊃ B is true here if there exists a proof (q.v.) that, if conjoined to a proof of A, would produce a proof of B.
