Theorem,   in mathematics and logic, a proposition or statement that is demonstrated. In geometry, a proposition is commonly considered as a problem (a construction to be effected) or a theorem (a statement to be proved). The statement “If two lines intersect, each pair of vertical angles is equal,” for example, is a theorem. The so-called fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that every (complex) polynomial equation in one variable has at least one complex root or solution. The Greeks also recognized a proposition lying between a theorem and a problem, the porism, directed to producing or finding what is proposed.
