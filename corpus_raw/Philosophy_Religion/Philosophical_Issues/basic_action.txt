Basic action,  In action theory, an action that is not performed by performing any other action. If someone turns on the light by flipping the switch, flipping the switch is more basic than turning on the light (because one cannot flip the switch by turning on the light), but moving one’s finger is unqualifiedly basic, since one does not do it by doing anything else. Contemporary philosophers have debated how to individuate acts—whether flipping the switch and turning on the light represent one act or two closely related acts.
