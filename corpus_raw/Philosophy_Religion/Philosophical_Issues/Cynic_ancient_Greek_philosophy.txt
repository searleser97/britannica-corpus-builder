Cynic,  member of a Greek philosophical sect that flourished from the 4th century bce to well into the Common Era, distinguished as much for its unconventional way of life as for its rejection of traditional social and political arrangements, professing instead a cosmopolitan utopia and communal anarchism. Antisthenes, a disciple of Socrates, is considered to be the founder of the movement, but Diogenes of Sinope embodied for most observers the Cynics’ worldview. He strove to destroy social conventions (including family life) as a way of returning to a “natural” life. Toward this end he lived as a vagabond pauper, slept in public buildings, and begged his food. He also advocated shamelessness (performing actions that were harmful to no one but unconventional in certain circumstances), outspokenness (to further his cause), and training in austerity.
Although equality was an essential feature of his primitive utopia, Diogenes denied equality to the masses (polloi), whom he compared unfavourably to barbarians and animals, owing to their corruption by convention. Membership in the Cynic fellowship entailed free access to, but not ownership of, material goods, as well as acceptance of stealing and begging. Crates of Thebes and some Cynics of the Roman era opted for milder ways of expressing their indifference to material goods—namely, by endorsing redistribution of wealth or generous donations of personal property to the needy.
In the history of political thought, Cynics are often regarded as the first anarchists, because they regarded the destruction of the state—which, owing to its hierarchical nature, was the cause of a plethora of misfortunes—as the only salvation for the human species. However, Cynics were equally skeptical of democracy and freedom, which entail duties that compromise self-sufficiency and provide rights that are unnecessary.
