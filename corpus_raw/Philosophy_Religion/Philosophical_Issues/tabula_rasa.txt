Tabula rasa, (Latin: “scraped tablet”—i.e., “clean slate”)  in epistemology (theory of knowledge) and psychology, a supposed condition that empiricists have attributed to the human mind before ideas have been imprinted on it by the reaction of the senses to the external world of objects.
Comparison of the mind to a blank writing tablet occurs in Aristotle’s De anima (4th century bce; On the Soul), and the Stoics as well as the Peripatetics (students at the Lyceum, the school founded by Aristotle) subsequently argued for an original state of mental blankness. Both the Aristotelians and the Stoics, however, emphasized those faculties of the mind or soul that, having been only potential or inactive before receiving ideas from the senses, respond to the ideas by an intellectual process and convert them into knowledge.
A new and revolutionary emphasis on the tabula rasa occurred late in the 17th century, when the English empiricist John Locke, in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689), argued for the mind’s initial resemblance to “white paper, void of all characters,” with “all the materials of reason and knowledge” derived from experience. Locke did not believe, however, that the mind is literally blank or empty prior to experience, and almost no other empiricist has taken such an extreme position. Locke himself acknowledged an innate power of “reflection” (awareness of one’s own ideas, sensations, emotions, and so on) as a means of exploiting the materials given by experience as well as a limited realm of a priori (nonexperiential) knowledge, which he nevertheless regarded as “trifling” and essentially empty of content (e.g., “soul is soul” and “every man is an animal”). The 18th-century Scottish empiricist David Hume held similar views. Suitably qualified notions of the tabula rasa remained influential in British and subsequently Anglo-American (analytic) philosophy through the mid-20th century.
