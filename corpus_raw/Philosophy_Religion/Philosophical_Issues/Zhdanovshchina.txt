Zhdanovshchina, English Zhdanovism,  cultural policy of the Soviet Union during the Cold War period following World War II, calling for stricter government control of art and promoting an extreme anti-Western bias. Originally applied to literature, it soon spread to other arts and gradually affected all spheres of intellectual activity in the Soviet Union, including philosophy, biology, medicine, and other sciences. It was initiated by a resolution (1946) of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that was formulated by the party secretary and cultural boss Andrey Aleksandrovich Zhdanov. It was directed against two literary magazines, Zvezda and Leningrad, which had published supposedly apolitical, bourgeois, individualistic works of the satirist Mikhail Zoshchenko and the poet Anna Akhmatova, who were expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers. The union itself underwent reorganization, but the aims of the resolution were more far-reaching: to free Soviet culture from “servility before the West.”
As the campaign accelerated, all vestiges of Westernism, or cosmopolitanism, in Soviet life were ferreted out. Earlier critics and literary historians were denounced for suggesting that Russian classics had been influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Molière, Lord Byron, or Charles Dickens. Western inventions and scientific theories were claimed to be of Russian origin. Although Zhdanov died in 1948, the campaign against “cosmopolites” continued until the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, acquiring increasingly anti-Semitic overtones.
This period (1946–53) is generally regarded as the lowest ebb of Soviet literature, and, short though it was, it created a barrier in Soviet-Western cultural interchange that was difficult to overcome.
