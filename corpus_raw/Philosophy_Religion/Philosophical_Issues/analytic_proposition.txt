Analytic proposition,  in logic, a statement or judgment that is necessarily true on purely logical grounds and serves only to elucidate meanings already implicit in the subject; its truth is thus guaranteed by the principle of contradiction. Such propositions are distinguished from synthetic propositions, the meanings of which include information imported from nonlogical (usually empirical) sources and which are therefore contingent. Thus the proposition that all bodies are extended is analytic, because the notion of extension is implicit in the notion of body; whereas the proposition that all bodies are heavy is synthetic, since the notion of weight supposes in addition to the notion of body that of bodies in relation to one another. In the 19th century Bernard Bolzano, a Prague logician and epistemologist, added a third category, the analytically false.
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a 17th-century German rationalist, had made a parallel distinction between “truths of reason” and “truths of fact,” and David Hume, a Scottish skeptic, had distinguished between “relations of ideas” and “matters of fact.” The first definition of an analytic statement approaching logical adequacy was that of Bolzano, who held that a sentence is analytically true if either (1) its propositional form is true for all values of its variables or (2) it can be reduced to such a sentence.
Most contemporary logicians hold that the most fundamental domain to which analyticity pertains is not that of judgments (which are too psychological), nor of sentences (which belong to a specific language), nor of definitions (which are about words instead of objects); it is, instead, that of statements (which refer to meanings of sentences). To this reference to meanings Gottlob Frege, one of the founders of contemporary logic, added a reference to “general logical laws,” these two references being the only requirements for the proof of an analytic statement.
The distinction between analytic and synthetic statements aroused extensive debate in the mid-20th century, particularly in view of objections raised by the American logician Willard Van Orman Quine.
