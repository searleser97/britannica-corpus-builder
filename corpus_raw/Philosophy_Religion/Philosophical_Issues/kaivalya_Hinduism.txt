Kaivalya, (Sanskrit: “separateness”)  in the Samkhya school of Hinduism, a state of liberation (moksha: literally, “release”) that the consciousness of an individual (purusha: “self” or “soul”) achieves by realizing that it is separate from matter (prakriti). The Samkhya school posits a dualistic cosmology. Both prakriti and purusha are eternal and of distinct natures. While prakriti is always changing, purusha is constant. They may, however, commingle, causing the purusha to become captivated by the material world. When this happens, the purusha ignores its true nature, falls under the delusion that it is part and parcel of the material world, becomes bound to this world because of karma (the effects of both good and bad actions), and undergoes a series of reincarnations. Release from this bondage is effected by the purusha’s realization of its total separateness from prakriti; hence the term kaivalya.
