Decision problem,   for a class of questions in mathematics and formal logic, the problem of finding, after choosing any question of the class, an algorithm or repetitive procedure that will yield a definite answer, “yes” or “no,” to that question. The method consists of performing successively a finite number of steps determined by preassigned rules. In particular, the term is used for such procedures for finding whether—in a particular logistic system, logical calculus, or formal mathematical system—some given “well-formed formula” (generated in accordance with established formation rules) is or is not provable as a theorem of the system.
