Nirguṇa,   (Sanskrit: “distinctionless”), concept of primary importance in the orthodox Hindu philosophy of Vedānta, raising the question of whether the supreme being, Brahman, is to be characterized as without qualities (nirguṇa) or as possessing qualities (saguṇa).
The Advaita (Nondualist) school of Vedānta assumes on the basis of selected passages of the Upaniṣads that Brahman is beyond all polarity and therefore cannot be characterized in the normal terms of human discursive thought. This being the case, Brahman cannot possess qualities that distinguish it from all other magnitudes, as Brahman is not a magnitude but is all.
The fundamental text of this tenet is the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad definition of Brahman as neti-neti (“not this! not that!” 2.3.6). The scriptural texts that ascribe qualities to Brahman, leading to the conception of a qualified Brahman (saguṇa) are, according to the Advaita school, merely preparatory aids to meditations. Others, notably the theistic schools of Vedānta (for example, Viśiṣṭādvaita), argue that God (Brahman) is possessed of all perfections and that the scriptural passages denying qualities deny only imperfect ones.
