Ideal language,   in analytic philosophy, a language that is precise, free of ambiguity, and clear in structure, on the model of symbolic logic, as contrasted with ordinary language, which is vague, misleading, and sometimes contradictory. In the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922), the Viennese-born philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein viewed the role of language as providing a “picture of reality.” Truth was seen as making logical propositions that correspond to reality. An ideal language was thus seen as the necessary criterion for determining the meaning, or meaninglessness, of statements about the world.
