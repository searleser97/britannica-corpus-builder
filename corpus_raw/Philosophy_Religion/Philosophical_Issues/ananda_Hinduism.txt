Ānanda,   (Sanskrit: “joy,” or “bliss”), in Indian philosophy of the Upaniṣads and the school of Vedānta, an important attribute of the supreme being Brahman. Bliss is characteristically used in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad (c. 6th century bc) to define Brahman and, simultaneously, the highest state of the individual self. This bliss is identified with the bliss that is brought to the self by its release from the shackles of the body. In this sense ānanda continues to play an important role in the orthodox school of Hindu philosophy, the Vedānta, though the nature of this bliss is differently interpreted according to the views held about Brahman itself.
