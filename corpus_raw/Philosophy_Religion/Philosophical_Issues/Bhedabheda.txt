Bhedabheda, Sanskrit Bhedābheda (“Identity and Difference”),  an important branch of Vedanta, a system of Indian philosophy. Its principal author was Bhaskara, probably a younger contemporary of the great 8th-century-ce thinker Shankara of the Advaita (nondualist) school. The mainstay of Bhaskara’s philosophy was the conviction that acts and knowledge are not mutually exclusive but, rather, mutually reinforcing. In contrast, Shankara held that ultimately only total resignation and withdrawal from acts are necessary to attain release (moksha) from rebirth (samsara). Against that view, Bhaskara upheld the doctrine of the “cumulative effect of acts and knowledge” (jnana-karma-samuccaya) and declared that a person should withdraw only after an active life in which he fulfilled his obligations. On the important issue of the relationship between brahman (the Absolute) and the world, Bhaskara taught that the two are identical; if, he said, brahman is the substantial cause of the world, then the world itself is real. Difference occurs when certain limiting conditions (upadhis) are imposed on brahman.
Bhaskara’s doctrine never became widely accepted, for Shankara had already expounded his own view, which soon gained great influence. Nevertheless, his work remains important, for it documents the typical Brahman (priestly class) concern with the implementation of dharma—that is, the class and individual obligations that keep the world in balance and produce the good society. In Bhaskara’s opinion, the tenet that the world is, in the end, illusory attacks the validity of this dharma, and the commandment of renunciation of the world prevents the fulfillment of it.
