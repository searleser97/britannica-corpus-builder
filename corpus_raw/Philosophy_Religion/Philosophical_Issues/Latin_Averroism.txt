Latin Averroism,   the teachings of a number of Western Christian philosophers who, in the later Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, drew inspiration from the interpretation of Aristotle put forward by Averroës, a Muslim philosopher. The basic tenet of Latin Averroism was the assertion that reason and philosophy are superior to faith and knowledge founded on faith. The Latin Averroists, represented in Paris by John of Jandun and in Italy by Taddeo of Parma and Angelo of Arezzo, also held that the creation of matter and of spirits was necessary and eternal and that there is but one “intellective soul” for all of humanity (thereby denying individual personality and immortality). They espoused also psychological determinism, which precluded moral responsibility.
