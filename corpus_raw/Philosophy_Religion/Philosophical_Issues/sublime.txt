Sublime,   in literary criticism, grandeur of thought, emotion, and spirit that characterizes great literature. It is the topic of an incomplete treatise, On the Sublime, that was for long attributed to the 3rd-century Greek philosopher Cassius Longinus but now believed to have been written in the 1st century ad by an unknown writer frequently designated Pseudo-Longinus.
The author of the treatise defines sublimity as “excellence in language,” the “expression of a great spirit,” and the power to provoke “ecstasy.” Departing from traditional classical criticism, which sought to attribute the success of literary works to their balance of certain technical elements—diction, thought, metaphor, music, etc.—he saw the source of the sublime in the moral, emotional, and imaginative depth of the writer and its expression in the flare-up of genius that rules alone could not produce.
The concept had little influence on modern criticism until the late 17th and 18th centuries, when it had its greatest impact in England. Its vogue there coincided with renewed interest in the plays of William Shakespeare, and it served as an important critical basis for Romanticism.
