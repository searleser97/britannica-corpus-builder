Islamic philosophy, or Arabic philosophy, Arabic falsafah,  doctrines of the philosophers of the 9th–12th century Islamic world who wrote primarily in Arabic. These doctrines combine Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism with other ideas introduced through Islam.
Islamic philosophy is related to but distinct from the theological doctrines and movements in Islam. Al-Kindi, for instance, one of the first Islamic philosophers, flourished in a milieu in which the dialectic theology (kalām) of the Muʿtazilah movement spurred much of the interest and investment in the study of Greek philosophy, but he himself was not a participant in the theological debates of the time. Al-Rāzī, meanwhile, was influenced by contemporary theological debates on atomism in his work on the composition of matter. Christians and Jews also participated in the philosophical movements of the Islamic world, and schools of thought were divided by philosophic rather than religious doctrine.
Other influential thinkers include the Persians al-Farabi and Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā), as well as the Spaniard Averroës (Ibn Rushd), whose interpretations of Aristotle were taken up by both Jewish and Christian thinkers. When the Arabs dominated Andalusian Spain, the Arabic philosophic literature was translated into Hebrew and Latin. In Egypt around the same time, the philosophic tradition was developed by Moses Maimonides and Ibn Khaldūn.
The prominence of classical Islamic philosophy declined in the 12th and 13th centuries in favour of mysticism, as articulated by thinkers such as al-Ghazālī and Ibn al-ʿArabī, and traditionalism, as promulgated by Ibn Taymiyyah. Nonetheless, Islamic philosophy, which reintroduced Aristotelianism to the Latin West, remained influential in the development of medieval Scholasticism and of modern European philosophy.
