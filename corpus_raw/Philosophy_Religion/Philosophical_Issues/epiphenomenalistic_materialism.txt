Epiphenomenalistic materialism, also called epiphenomenalism,  a philosophical theory, associated with mechanistic materialism, according to which mental states or events are by-products of states or events in the brain, necessarily caused by them but exercising no causality themselves. Thus, a certain thought, belief, desire, intention, or sensation is produced by a specific brain state or event but in no way affects the brain or the body to which the brain is connected.
