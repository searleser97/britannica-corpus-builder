Saṃvṛti-satya,   (Sanskrit: “the empirical truth”), in Buddhist thought, the truth based on the common understanding of ordinary people. It refers to the empirical reality usually accepted in everyday life and can be admitted for practical purposes of communication. It is distinct from the ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya), which lies beneath empirical phenomena and is beyond verbal expression. This ultimate truth is that of universal emptiness (sunyata), regarded as the true nature of the phenomenal world, which has no independent substantiality.
To assert the truth of sunyata, Nāgārjuna, the 2nd/3rd-century founder of the Mādhyamika (Middle View) school, expounded the two aspects of truth: the empirical truth (saṃvṛti-satya) and the ultimate real truth (paramārtha-satya). Ultimate truth is beyond word and thought and can be positively grasped only by intuition. Empirical truth, on the other hand, is based upon knowledge of the external world by means of verbal designation. In the final analysis, however, phenomenal existence has no independent substantiality corresponding to the words used to describe it. Such existence, as asserted by realists, is merely fictitious.
The Mādhyamika doctrine of the two aspects of truth had a great influence upon other philosophical schools, including non-Buddhist traditions. Śankara, the 8th-century Hindu philosopher of the Advaita Vedānta school, among others, adopted the doctrine into his system, which led his opponents to call him a crypto-Buddhist.
