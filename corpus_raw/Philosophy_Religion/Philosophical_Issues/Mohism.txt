Mohism, also spelled Moism,  school of Chinese philosophy founded by Mozi (q.v.) in the 5th century bce. This philosophy challenged the dominant Confucian ideology until about the 3rd century bce. Mozi taught the necessity for individual piety and submission to the will of heaven, or Shangdi (the Lord on High), and deplored the Confucian emphasis on rites and ceremonies as a waste of government funds.
In contrast to the Confucian moral ideal of ren (“humanity” or “benevolence”), which differentiated the special love for one’s parents and family from the general love shown to fellow men, the Mohists advocated the practice of love without distinctions (jianai). The Confucians, in particular Mencius, bitterly attacked the Mohist concept of undifferentiated love because it challenged the basis of Confucian family harmony, which was in fact and theory the foundation for the social harmony of the Confucian state.
