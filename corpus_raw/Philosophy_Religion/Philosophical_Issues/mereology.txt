Mereology,   branch of logic, founded by the 20th-century logician Stanisław Leśniewski, that tries to clarify class expressions and theorizes on the relation between parts and wholes. It attempts to explain Bertrand Russell’s paradox of the class of all those classes that are not elements of themselves. Leśniewski claimed that a distinction should be made between the distributive and the collective interpretation of class expressions because failure to do so makes the presuppositions of Russell’s paradox appear to be true. Once the distinction is made, however, some of those presuppositions are evidently false on either interpretation.
