Pratyaksha, (Sanskrit: “that which is before one’s eyes”)  in Indian philosophy, perception, the first of the five means of knowledge, or pramanas, that enable a person to have correct cognitions of the world. Pratyaksha is of two kinds, direct perception (anubhava) and remembered perception (smriti). Some schools make a further distinction between indiscriminate perception (nirvikalpaka), in which the object is perceived without its distinguishing features, and discriminate perception (savikalpaka), in which the distinguishing features are both observed and recognized. Indiscriminate perception is important to the followers of the Advaita (Nondualist) school of Vedanta, for it allows for the liberating perception of brahman (ultimate reality), which is without features.
