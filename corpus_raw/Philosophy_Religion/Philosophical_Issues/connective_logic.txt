Connective, also called Sentential Connective, or Propositional Connective,  in logic, a word or group of words that joins two or more propositions together to form a connective proposition. Commonly used connectives include “but,” “and,” “or,” “if . . . then,” and “if and only if.” The various types of logical connectives include conjunction (“and”), disjunction (“or”), negation (“not”), conditional (“if . . . then”), and biconditional (“if and only if”). In a conjunction, two or more propositions that are stated as true at the same time are joined by the connective “and,” as in the statement “Life is short, and art is long.” In a sentence such as “If the weather remains mild and there is no frost, then there will be a good harvest,” the connective is “If . . . then.” The premises and conclusion of a syllogism are also joined by connectives, as in “All men are mortal and no gods are mortal, therefore no men are gods.”
