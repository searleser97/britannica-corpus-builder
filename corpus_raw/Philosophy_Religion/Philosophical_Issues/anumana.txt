Anumana, (Sanskrit: “measuring along some other thing” or “inference”)  in Indian philosophy, the second of the pramanas, or the five means of knowledge. Inference occupies a central place in the Hindu school of logic (Nyaya). This school worked out a syllogism in the form of an argument that goes through five stages: (1) the proposition (pratijna, literally “promise”), (2) the ground (hetu), (3) the illustration (udaharana), (4) the application (upanaya), and (5) the conclusion (nigamana). A syllogism is vitiated by a fallacious ground; this is called hetvabhasa (“the mere appearance of a ground”). A number of types of invalid grounds are distinguished: simple error, contradiction, tautology, lack of proof for the ground, and inopportunity.
