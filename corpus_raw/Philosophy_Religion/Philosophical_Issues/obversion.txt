Obversion,   in syllogistic, or traditional, logic, transformation of a categorical proposition (q.v.), or statement, into a new proposition in which (1) the subject term is unchanged, (2) the predicate is replaced by its contradictory, and (3) the quality of the proposition is changed from affirmative to negative or vice versa. Thus the obverse of “Every man is mortal” is “No man is immortal.” Because the obverse of any categorical proposition is logically equivalent to it, obversion is a form of immediate inference. See also conversion.
