Prajñapti, (Sanskrit: “designation by provisional naming”) Pāli Paññatti,  in Buddhist philosophy, the denotation of a thing by a word. The concept of prajñapti is especially important in the Mādhyamika (“Middle View”) and Vijñānavāda (“Consciousness-affirming”) schools. Prajñapti is seen as a fictitious construction unrelated to ultimate reality, or niṣprapañca (Sanskrit; Pāli nippapañca: “what is devoid of verbal manifoldness”).
According to Mādhyamika and Vijñānavāda philosophers, the highest reality is nondifferential, beyond word and thought. Whatever is differentiated by prajñapti is regarded as only nominally existent. Since words denote no reality, empirical knowledge regarding worldly phenomena cannot be held as true in itself. This assertion results from the school’s analysis of the process of cognition. When a person sees an object, there is only an immediate awareness that is yet undifferentiated into conceptions of perceptual judgment expressed in statements such as “This is that.” There occurs no analysis of the awareness into subject and object or subject and predicate. Such an analysis is brought about by a conceptual construction, which associates a thing with a name of a conception. This is the cause of illusion, since verbal designation is denied reality, and all empirical knowledge is composed of such judgment.
