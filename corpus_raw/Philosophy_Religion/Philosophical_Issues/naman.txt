Naman, (Sanskrit), Pali nama,  in Vedism and Hinduism, the characteristic sign or mark, most frequently used in the sense of the “name,” of an individual, or the word that stands for an object. The term has been appropriated by Indian linguistics to denote the noun in a sentence unit. In some Hindu schools the term assumes the philosophical meaning of the essence, or substance, of a thing, as opposed to its form (rupa). In Theravada Buddhism nama denotes the four immaterial components of one’s personality: feelings (vedana); ideations (sanna); mental formations, or dispositions (sankhara); and consciousness (vinnana). These subtle components are said to conjoin with various physical qualities, such as size, shape, and weight, to form the individual person. According to most schools of Buddhist thought and practice, the identification of any or all of these immaterial and material components of an individual with any sort of essential personality is a hindrance to the attainment of enlightenment. Thus, a Buddhist who is on the path to enlightenment endeavours to comprehend the fundamental unreality of both the immaterial (naman) and the material (rupa) aspects of reality.
