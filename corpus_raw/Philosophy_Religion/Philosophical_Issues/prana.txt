Prana, (Sanskrit: “breath”) also spelled prāṇa,  in Indian philosophy, the body’s vital “airs,” or energies. A central conception in early Hindu philosophy, particularly as expressed in the Upanishads, prana was held to be the principle of vitality and was thought to survive as a person’s “last breath” for eternity or until a future life.
Prana was at times identified with the self. The “five pranas” are windlike vital forces that assist breathing, distribution of food in the body, and digestion. Yoga philosophy emphasizes full control of the prana, through the practice of pranayama, to enable meditation without respiratory distraction and for its therapeutic effect on disorders.
