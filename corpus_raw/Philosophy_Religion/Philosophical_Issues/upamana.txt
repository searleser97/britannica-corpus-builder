Upamana, (Sanskrit: “comparison”)  in Indian philosophy, the fourth of the five means (pramanas) by which one can have valid cognitions of the world. Upamana describes knowledge imparted by means of analogy. For example, when the meaning of the word gavaya (Sanskrit: “wild ox”) is unknown, the similarity of the name to the word gaus (“cow”) will provide knowledge that gavaya is in the bovine family.
