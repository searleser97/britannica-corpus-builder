Principle of sufficient reason,  in the philosophy of the 17th- and 18th-century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, an explanation to account for the existence of certain monads despite their contingency. Having ascribed to existent monads indestructibility, self-sufficiency, and imperviousness to extrinsic causality, Leibniz distinguished truths of reason, whose nonexistence would involve a contradiction, from truths of fact, whose existence depended on Godâ€™s free choice. The actual existence of the latter is explained by the principle of sufficient reason, which asserts that there is an adequate reason to account for the existence and nature of everything that could conceivably not exist. In each such case, the ultimate sufficient reason is the free choice of God. This principle received various formulations from Leibniz and from later philosophers.
