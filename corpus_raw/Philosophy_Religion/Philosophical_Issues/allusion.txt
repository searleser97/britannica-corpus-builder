Allusion,  in literature, an implied or indirect reference to a person, event, or thing or to a part of another text. Most allusions are based on the assumption that there is a body of knowledge that is shared by the author and the reader and that therefore the reader will understand the author’s referent. The word allusion comes from the late Latin allusio meaning “a play on words” or “game” and is a derivative of the Latin word alludere, meaning “to play around” or “to refer to mockingly.”
In traditional Western literature, allusions to figures in the Bible and from Greek mythology are common. However, some authors, such as the Modernist writers T.S. Eliot and James Joyce, deliberately used obscure and complex allusions in their work that they knew few readers would readily understand.
An allusion can be used as a straightforward device to enhance a text by providing further meaning, but it can also be used in a more complex sense to make an ironic comment on one thing by comparing it to something that is dissimilar. Over time, as shared knowledge changes, allusions can also reveal the unspoken assumptions and biases of both authors and readers.
Allusion shares some features with, but is to be distinguished from, the literary devices of parody and imitation. All three require a reader and an author to share some amount of knowledge, but an author’s intentions differ with each.
