Intention,   (Latin: intentio), in scholastic logic and psychology, a concept used to describe a mode of being or relation. In knowing, the mind is said to “intend” or “tend toward” its object, and a thing as known, or in the knowing mind, has “intentional being.” Intention may mean either the mind knowing or the knowledge itself, analogous to the use of perception for the act of perceiving or for the thing perceived. First intention is knowledge of a thing as it is in itself; second intention, knowledge of the thing as known. Thus, the term man is in first intention in the statement “man is mortal,” but in second intention in “man is a species.” Logic was held by the scholastics to consist of the study of second intentions.
