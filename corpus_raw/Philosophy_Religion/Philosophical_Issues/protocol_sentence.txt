Protocol sentence,   in the philosophy of Logical Positivism, a statement that describes immediate experience or perception and as such is held to be the ultimate ground for knowledge. Such a statement is also called an atomic statement, observation statement, judgment of perception, or basic statement; in particular, the term protocol sentence is associated with the work of Rudolf Carnap, a 20th-century German-American philosopher of science and of language.
A protocol sentence, which reports the sensations of a particular observer at a particular time, may range in complexity from “blue patch now” to “A blue sphere is on the table.” It is thought to be irrefutable and therefore the ultimate justification for other more complex statements, particularly for statements of science. If a scientific statement is equivalent in meaning to some set of protocol sentences, it is considered true; thus, science is firmly grounded in observation and experience.
This view was challenged by philosophers who argue that all statements presuppose some nonobservational framework (such as the ability to recognize a colour as blue). Therefore, they assert, protocol sentences are not basic and can always be replaced by a set of more fundamental sentences. The attempt to ground knowledge in protocol sentences is then faced with the possibility of an infinite regress to ever more basic sentences. Further, if the protocol sentences are truly reports of the sensations of a particular observer, then they are not intersubjectively testable; being not necessarily true for all observing subjects, they are not scientific. Thus, according to this criticism, if every scientific statement were equivalent to a set of protocol sentences, then each would be equivalent to a set of nonscientific statements—i.e., to a set of purely subjective statements.
