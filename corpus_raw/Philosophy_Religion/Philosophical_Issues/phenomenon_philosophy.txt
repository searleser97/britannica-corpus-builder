Phenomenon,   in philosophy, any object, fact, or occurrence perceived or observed. In general, phenomena are the objects of the senses (e.g., sights and sounds) as contrasted with what is apprehended by the intellect. The Greek verb phainesthai (“to seem,” or “to appear”) does not indicate whether the thing perceived is other than what it appears to be. Thus in Aristotle’s ethics “the apparent good” is what seems good to a man, whether or not it really is good. Later Greek philosophers distinguished observed facts (phenomena) from theories devised to explain them. This usage, widely adopted in the 17th century by scientists who sought to explain phenomena of natural science (e.g., magnetism), is still current.
In modern philosophy the word is sometimes used for what is immediately apprehended by the senses before any judgment is made; it has, however, never become a technical term, many philosophers preferring sense-datum or some such expression—though they commonly accept the cognate forms phenomenalism and phenomenology. In English translations of the works of Immanuel Kant, “phenomenon” is often used to translate Erscheinung (“appearance”), Kant’s term for the immediate object of sensory intuition, the bare datum that becomes an object only when interpreted through the categories of substance and cause. Kant contrasted it to the noumenon, or thing-in-itself, to which the categories do not apply.
