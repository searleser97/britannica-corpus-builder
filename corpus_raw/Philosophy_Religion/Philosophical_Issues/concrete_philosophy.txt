Concrete,   in philosophy, such entities as persons, physical objects, and events (or the terms or names that denote such things), as contrasted with such abstractions as numbers, classes, states, qualities, and relations. Many philosophers, however, add a third category of collective names, or concrete universals, i.e., names of classes or collections of concrete things, distinct from the abstract.
The distinction between abstract and concrete, though clear enough in general, is not a very sharp one, and borderline cases may be found. The series of terms “theory, true proposition, fact, and event” is an example, as, in theoretical physics, is the series “conductivity, speed, heat, magnetic field, light, electric charge, electron, molecule, quartz crystal.” In each case, the series begins with an abstract term; and it is fairly well agreed that the terms grow successively more concrete. If an absolute separation into abstract and concrete is demanded, however, it is difficult to decide where to draw the line.
In existential philosophy, the concreteness of human existence in the world is strongly stressed; thus, the specific events of an individual’s lived-through experience are characterized as concrete in contrast to the lifeless formalisms of logical analysis and the tenuous webs of metaphysical speculation. Understood in this sense, a “turn to the concrete” emerged as perhaps the most fundamental feature of mid-20th-century continental European philosophy, as also of the existentialist strands in American philosophy.
