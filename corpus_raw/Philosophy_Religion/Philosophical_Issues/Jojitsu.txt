Jōjitsu, Chinese Ch’eng-shih,  minor school of Buddhist philosophy introduced into Japan from China during the Nara period (710–784). The school holds that neither the self nor the elements that make up the mental and material world have any permanent, changeless reality and that they therefore cannot be said to have any real existence.
The school takes its name from its most authoritative text, the Jōjitsu-ron (Sanskrit: Satyasiddhi-shastra; “Treatise on Establishing the Truth”), attributed to the 3rd–4th-century Indian scholar Harivarman, who studied both Hinayana and Mahayana traditions. The doctrine was introduced into Japan in the 7th century by the learned Korean priest Ekwan. The school now exists in Japan only as a subsect of the Sanron (“Three Treatises”) school and is no longer found in China.
