Ayatana, Sanskrit āyatana (“field” or “base”),  in Buddhist philosophy, the field of cognition. Human physical existence consists of 12 ayatanas: the 6 cognitive faculties (5 sense organs and the mind) and the 6 corresponding categories of objects. This classification of the elements of the world is based on human experience and is used by Buddhist philosophers to explain how everything in the temporal world is transient and nonsubstantial.
