Zao Jun, Wade-Giles romanization Tsao Chün,  in Chinese religion, the “Furnace Prince” whose magical powers of alchemy produced gold dinnerware that conferred immortality on the diner. The Han-dynasty emperor Wudi was reportedly duped by Li Shaojun, a self-styled mystic, into believing that this new deity was capable of conferring immunity from old age. Accordingly, Wudi offered the first sacrifice to Zao Jun in 133 bce. A year after Li was brought to the palace, he secretly fed a piece of inscribed silk to a bull, then informed the emperor that the animal’s stomach contained mysterious sayings. When Li’s handwriting was recognized, the emperor ordered his execution. At that time, it was believed that Zao Jun’s chief duty was to watch over the furnace that produced gold, the means to immortality.
Han emperor Xuandi (reigned 74–48/49 bce) is said to have seen Zao Jun in human form as Chan Zifang, who wore yellow garments and had unkempt hair cascading to his shoulders. The emperor, much impressed, sacrificed a lamb in his honour. About the 7th century ce the similarity of names caused Zao Jun to be identified with Zao Shen, god of the kitchen (or hearth), who in turn was later confused with Huo Shen, the god of fire.
