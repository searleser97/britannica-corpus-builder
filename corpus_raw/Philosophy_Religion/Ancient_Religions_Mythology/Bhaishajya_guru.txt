Bhaishajya-guru, (Sanskrit), Tibetan Sman-bla-rgyal-po, Chinese Yaoshi fo, Japanese Yakushi Nyorai,  in Mahayana Buddhism, the healing buddha (“enlightened one”), widely worshipped in Tibet, China, and Japan. According to popular belief in those countries, some illnesses are effectively cured by merely touching his image or calling out his name. More serious illnesses, however, require the performance of complex ritual acts, as described in the principal scripture of the Bhaishajya-guru cult. Bhaishajya-guru is associated with the Dhyani-Buddha (“self-born,” eternal buddha) Akshobhya—and by some Japanese sects with another eternal buddha, Vairochana—and rules over the Eastern Paradise.
In Japan the worship of Bhaishajya-guru reached a peak during the Heian period (794–1185), and he is especially venerated by the Tendai, Shingon, and Zen sects. In Japan he is often represented in the garb of a blue-skinned buddha with his medicine bowl in one hand. In Tibet he often holds the medicinal myrobalan fruit. He has in his retinue 12 divine yaksha (nature spirit) generals who protect true believers. Chinese Buddhists, in a later phase, connected these generals with the 12 hours of the day and the 12 years of the Chinese calendar’s cycle.
The Bhaishajyaguru-sutra had four Chinese translations, the earliest from the Eastern Jin period (317–420 ce), and two Tibetan versions.
