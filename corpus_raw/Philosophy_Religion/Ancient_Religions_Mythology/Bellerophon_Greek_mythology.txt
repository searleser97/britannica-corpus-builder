Bellerophon, also called Bellerophontes,  hero in Greek legend. In the Iliad he was the son of Glaucus, who was the son of Sisyphus of Ephyre (traditionally Corinth). The wife of King Proetus of Argos—named Anteia (in Homer’s telling) or Stheneboea (in the works of Hesiod and later writers)—loved Bellerophon; when he rejected her overtures, she falsely accused him to her husband. Proetus then sent Bellerophon to Iobates, the king of Lycia, with a message that he was to be slain. That king sent him against some dangerous antagonists, but since he always triumphed, the king finally recognized Bellerophon as more than human and married him to his daughter. Bellerophon lived in prosperity until he fell out of favour with the gods, lost two of his children, and wandered grief-stricken over the Aleian Plain.
Euripides and some later writers added that, while still at Corinth, Bellerophon tamed the winged horse Pegasus with a bridle given to him by Athena and that he used Pegasus to fight the Chimera and afterward to punish Stheneboea. He supposedly earned the wrath of the gods by trying to fly up to heaven and was thrown from Pegasus and lamed. This version is found in Euripides’ Bellerophontes and is parodied in Aristophanes’ Peace.
Bellerophon’s adventures were frequently represented in ancient art and formed the subject of the Iobates of Sophocles and of the Stheneboea of Euripides, as well as of the works mentioned above.
