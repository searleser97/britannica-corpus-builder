Kushukh, also spelled Kushuh,  the Hurrian moon god. In the Hurrian pantheon, Kushukh was regularly placed above the sun god, Shimegi; his consort was Niggal (the Sumero-Akkadian Ningal). His home was said to be the city of Kuzina (location unknown), and his cult was later adopted by the Hittites. As Lord of the Oath he had as his special function the punishment of perjury. He was represented as a winged man with a crescent on his helmet and sometimes standing on a lion; in this form he appears among the images of Hittite gods at the rock sanctuary of Yazılıkaya (near modern Boğazköy in Turkey).
