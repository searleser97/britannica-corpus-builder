Frigg, also called Friia,  in Norse mythology, the wife of Odin and mother of Balder. She was a promoter of marriage and of fertility. In Icelandic stories, she tried to save her sonâ€™s life but failed. Some myths depict her as the weeping and loving mother, while others stress her loose morals. Frigg was known to other Germanic peoples as Frija (in German) and Frea; her name survives in English in the word Friday.
