Bishamon, also called Bishamonten,  in Japanese mythology, one of the Shichi-fuku-jin (“Seven Gods of Luck”). He is identified with the Buddhist guardian of the north, known as Kubera, or Vaiśravaṇa. Bishamon is always depicted as dressed in full armour, carrying a spear and a miniature pagoda. He is the protector of the righteous and is the Buddhist patron of warriors.
The temple city of Shigi near Ōji (west-central Honshu) is dedicated to him. It was founded, according to tradition, by Shōtoku Taishi (ad 573–621), who attributed a victory over an enemy of Buddhism to Bishamon’s assistance. See also Shichi-fuku-jin.
