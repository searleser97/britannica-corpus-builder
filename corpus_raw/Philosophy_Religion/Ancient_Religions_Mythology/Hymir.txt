Hymir, also spelled Hymer,  in Norse mythology, giant who was the father of the god Tyr. Hymir owned a large kettle and it was to get this that Tyr and Thor paid a visit to him. During that visit Thor went fishing with Hymir and caught the monstrous World Serpent. According to one version Thor killed the monster, but according to another Hymir cut his line just when the two mighty enemies were looking at each other. This scene is one of the most popular in Viking-age art and is often referred to in poetry.
