Turnus,  legendary warrior and leader of the Rutuli people, best known from his appearance in the second half of Virgil’s Aeneid (19 bc). Virgil identifies him as the son of Daunus and the nymph Venilia and as the brother of the nymph Juturna. The Roman historians Cato the Censor (2nd century bc) and Livy (1st century bc) identify Turnus as Aeneas’s major rival upon the latter’s escape to Italy after the sack of Troy. The Greek historian of early Rome Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1st century bc) calls him Tyrrhenus, which means “Etruscan.” In Virgil’s Aeneid Turnus is king of the city of Ardea, and his people are called the Rutuli. He is the favourite suitor of Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus, eponymous king of the Latins. When Latinus engages Lavinia to marry Aeneas instead, the goddess Juno, who hates the Trojans, drives Turnus mad. He leads his people in a war against Aeneas and the Trojans. After many acts of courage and rashness, Turnus is slain by Aeneas to avenge the killing of Evander’s son Pallas.
