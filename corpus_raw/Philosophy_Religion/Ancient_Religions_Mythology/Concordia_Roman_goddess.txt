Concordia,  in Roman religion, goddess who was the personification of “concord,” or “agreement,” especially among members or classes of the Roman state. She had several temples at Rome; the oldest and most important one was located in the Forum at the end of the Via Sacra (“Sacred Way”). After 121 bc, when the construction of the largest temple was ordered, the Senate frequently met at the temple in times of public uproar. The temple was restored under the emperor Augustus by his eventual successor, Tiberius, in 7 bc. Tiberius placed many works of art there, and the temple became a kind of museum and tourist attraction during the Roman Empire. Concordia often appeared on coins as a matron holding a cornucopia in her left hand and either an olive branch or a patera (a dish used in sacrifices) in her right.
