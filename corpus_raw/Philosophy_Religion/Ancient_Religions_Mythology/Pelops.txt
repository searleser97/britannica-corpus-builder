Pelops,  legendary founder of the Pelopid dynasty at Mycenae in the Greek Peloponnese, which was probably named for him. Pelops was a grandson of Zeus, the king of the gods. According to many accounts, his father, Tantalus, cooked and served Pelops to the gods at a banquet. Only Demeter, bereaved over the loss of her daughter, failed to recognize him and partook. When the body was ordered by the gods to be restored, the shoulder, Demeter’s portion, was missing; the goddess provided a replacement of ivory.
According to Pindar, however, the sea god Poseidon loved Pelops and took him up to heaven; the ghastly feast was merely malicious gossip to account for his disappearance. Pelops, however, had to return to mortal life because his father had abused the favour of heaven by feeding mere mortals with nectar and ambrosia, of which only gods partook. Later, according to Pindar, Pelops strove for the hand of Hippodamia, daughter of King Oenomaus of Pisa in Elis. Oenomaus, who had an incestuous love for his daughter, had previously killed 13 suitors. He challenged Pelops to a chariot chase, with Hippodamia the prize of victory and death the price of defeat. Though Oenomaus’ team and chariot were the gift of his father, the god Ares, Pelops’ chariot was from Poseidon. Pelops won the bride and killed Oenomaus.
In more hostile versions, Pelops bribed Oenomaus’ charioteer, Myrtilus, to remove the linchpins from Oenomaus’ chariot. After his victory, for reasons that are given differently in different sources, he threw Myrtilus into the sea that afterward was called the Myrtoan. Myrtilus—or Oenomaus—was said to have uttered the curse that dogged the Pelopid house of Atreus. (Preparations for the chariot race are depicted in the east pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.) Pelops thus became the ruler of the greater part of the Peloponnese. His shrine at Olympia, established by Heracles, had special importance.
