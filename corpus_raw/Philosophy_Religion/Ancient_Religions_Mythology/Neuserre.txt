Neuserre, also spelled Nyuserre,  sixth king of the 5th dynasty (c. 2465–c. 2325 bc) of Egypt; he is primarily known for his temple to the sun-god Re at Abū Jirāb (Abu Gurab) in Lower Egypt. The temple plan, like that built by Userkaf (the first king of the 5th dynasty), consisted of a valley temple, causeway, gate, and temple court, which contained an obelisk (the symbol of Re) and an alabaster altar. The sun-temple reliefs revealed an exceptionally high development of artistry and technique. Few written records were left from Neuserre’s reign, but the pyramid he used as a burial place has been located at Abū Ṣīr near the sun temples of Abū Jirāb. Though impressive in size, Neuserre’s pyramid was exceeded both in height and in length by his sun temple, indicating the unusual prominence of the cult of Re during the 5th dynasty.
