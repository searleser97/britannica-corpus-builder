Phoenix,  in Greek mythology, son of Amyntor, king of Thessalian Hellas. To please his mother, he seduced his father’s concubine. After a violent quarrel Amyntor cursed him with childlessness, and Phoenix escaped to Peleus (king of the Myrmidons in Thessaly), who made him responsible for the upbringing of his son Achilles. According to Book IX of Homer’s Iliad, Phoenix accompanied the young Achilles to Troy and was one of the envoys who tried to reconcile him with Agamemnon, chief commander of the Greek forces, after Agamemnon and Achilles had quarreled.
In Euripides’ lost tragedy Phoenix, Amyntor blinded his son. According to the mythographer Apollodorus of Athens, Phoenix’s sight was later restored by Chiron, the Centaur.
