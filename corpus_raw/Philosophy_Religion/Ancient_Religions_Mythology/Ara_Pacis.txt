Ara Pacis, also called Ara Pacis Augustae (Latin: “Altar of the Augustan Peace”),  shrine consisting of a marble altar in a walled enclosure erected in Rome’s Campus Martius (Field of Mars) in honour of the emperor Augustus and dedicated on Jan. 30, 9 bce. The dedication was recorded in Ovid’s Fasti as well as by Augustus himself in his “Res Gestae Divi Augusti” (“Achievements of the Divine Augustus”).
The structure was commissioned in 13 bce to commemorate Augustus’s return from the provinces of Gaul, where he had spent three years supervising the administration of the region. The Senate proposed building the altar in the Curia, but Augustus decided to place the structure near his mausoleum in the Campus Martius. Sedimentation from the rising Tiber River eventually buried the building.
Pieces of the shrine may have been excavated prior to 1536 during work on the palace that had been constructed on the site, as an engraving by Agostino Veneziano replicates a frieze known to have come from the shrine. More of the marble components were unearthed in the 1800s, though it was not until 1937 that a full-scale operation uncovered the remaining portions of the building. In 1938 a monument, later known as the Museo dell’Ara Pacis, was raised beside the Tiber to house the reconstituted edifice. In 2006 it was replaced by a structure designed by American architect Richard Meier.
Restoration of the Ara Pacis was ongoing during the 20th century, both to halt the decay related to age and to reverse the effects of earlier, haphazard attempts at salvage. The sculptures on the walls and on the altar represent the shrine’s dedication ceremonies, scenes from Roman legend, and floral motifs and are considered to be among the finest examples of Roman art.
