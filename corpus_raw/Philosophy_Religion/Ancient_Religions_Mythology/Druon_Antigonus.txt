Druon Antigonus,   legendary giant of Antwerp, who cut off the right hands of mariners refusing him tribute. His own right hand was cut off by another legendary giant, called Salvius Brabo, a cousin of Julius Caesar. The two severed hands included in the coat of arms of Antwerp have been connected with this legend, as has the etymology of the city’s name. The Brabo Fountain (1887), in front of the Hôtel de Ville, is surmounted by a statue of Brabo brandishing the severed hand of Druon.
