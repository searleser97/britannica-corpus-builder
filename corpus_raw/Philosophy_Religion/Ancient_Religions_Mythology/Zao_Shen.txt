Zao Shen, Wade-Giles romanization Tsao Shen,  in Chinese religion, the Kitchen God (literally, “god of the hearth”), who is believed to report to the celestial gods on family conduct and to have it within his power to bestow poverty or riches on individual families. Because he is also a protector of the home from evil spirits, his periodic absences are thought to make the house especially vulnerable to becoming haunted at such times. Zao Shen’s identity in life and in the history of his cult are uncertain. The god of the kitchen has also been confused with Huo Shen (god of fire) and with Zao Jun (“Furnace Prince”).
One belief was that at least once each month Zao Shen departs from his place above the kitchen stove to relate to the celestial gods, or to the city’s spiritual magistrate Cheng Huang (the City God; literally, “wall and moat”), what he has seen. It was also believed that toward the end of the 12th lunar month Zao Shen must make an annual report to the ruler of heaven. Before the time of his departure, honey or sweet food is ceremonially smeared over the lips of the god’s paper image so that only pleasant words may issue from his mouth. Offerings of food and wine are placed before the image, which is then burned along with figures of chariots, horses, money, and household utensils, all made of paper. As the new year begins, a fresh image is placed above the stove to welcome the returning deity.
