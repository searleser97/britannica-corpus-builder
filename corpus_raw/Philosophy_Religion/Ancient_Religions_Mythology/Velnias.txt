Velnias, also called Velinas, Vels, or Velns,  in Baltic religion, the god of the Lithuanian vėles or Latvian velis (“zombie”), the “phantom of the dead.” He is a one-eyed, prophetic trickster capable of raising whirlwinds and leading the host of the dead through the skies. Velnias is akin in type to the Germanic Wodan or the Scandinavian Odin and is identical with the god Patollo, or Pickollos, of early Old Prussian and Lithuanian sources.
