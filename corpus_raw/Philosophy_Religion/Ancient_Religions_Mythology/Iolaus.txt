Iolaus,  ancient Greek hero, the nephew, charioteer, and assistant of Heracles. He was the son of Iphicles, himself mortal half brother of Heracles by the same mother, Alcmene.
Iolaus aided Heracles in his second Labour, the slaying of the Hydra and its ally the crab. He also went with Heracles to the far west to capture the cattle of the giant Geryon (the 10th Labour). Hence he was associated with various places in Sicily and, later, in Sardinia—which he is said to have colonized with the 50 children Heracles had with the daughter of King Thespius. Iolaus was a famous charioteer; he won the chariot race at the first Olympic Games (founded by Heracles) and the race at the funeral games of Pelias. According to Pindar as well as to Euripides’ Children of Heracles (430 bc), Iolaus defended Heracles’ children from the attacks of Heracles’ old enemy Eurystheus. Iolaus had a hero cult at Thebes, but elsewhere he was worshipped only in conjunction with Heracles.
