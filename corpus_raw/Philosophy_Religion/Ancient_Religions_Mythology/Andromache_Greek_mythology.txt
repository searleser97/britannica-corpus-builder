Andromache,  in Greek legend, the daughter of Eëtion (prince of Thebe in Mysia) and wife of Hector (son of King Priam of Troy). All her relations perished when Troy was taken by Achilles. When the captives were allotted, Andromache fell to Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, whom she accompanied to Epirus and to whom she bore three sons. (Her son Molossus was claimed as an ancestor by the kings of Molossia in historical times—until the demise of the monarchy in the 3rd century bce.) Neoptolemus was slain at Delphi, and he left Andromache and the kingdom as well to Helenus, the brother of Hector. After the death of Helenus, Andromache returned to Asia Minor with her youngest son, Pergamus, who there founded a town named after himself.
