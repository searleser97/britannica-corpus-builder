Gyula Illyés,  (born Nov. 2, 1902, Racegres, Austria-Hungary [now in Hungary]—died April 14, 1983, Budapest), Hungarian poet, novelist, dramatist, and dissident, a leading literary figure in Hungary during the 20th century.
Illyés supported the short-lived soviet republic led by Béla Kun (1919). Sought by the police, Illyés went to Vienna, then to Berlin and to Paris, where he completed his education at the Sorbonne.
He returned to Hungary in 1926 and soon became a contributor to the literary review Nyugat (“The West”), which was edited from 1929 by his friend and mentor Mihály Babits. Eventually becoming editor of the magazine, Illyés renamed it Magyar csillag (“Hungarian Star”) in 1941. His major novel, Puszták népe (1936; People of the Puszta), describes the misery suffered by the Hungarian peasantry. During the German occupation of Hungary (1944–45), Illyés went underground.
In November 1945 he was elected to parliament as a member and cofounder of the Smallholders’ Party. When communists took over the government of Hungary in the late 1940s, Illyés, though not a Marxist, was tolerated. In 1950 he wrote “Egy mondat a zsarnokságról” (“One Sentence on Tyranny”), a poem that is critical of Mátyás Rákosi’s Stalinist regime. It was published during the October 1956 uprising.
Other works published in English include Illyés’s Selected Poems (1971) and his 1936 biography of the 19th-century Hungarian poet Sándor Petőfi, which was translated into English in 1973. His Hungarian Folk-tales was published in 1980.
