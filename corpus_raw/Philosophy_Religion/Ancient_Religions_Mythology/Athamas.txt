Athamas,  in Greek mythology, king of the prehistoric Minyans in the ancient Boeotian city of Orchomenus. His first wife was Nephele, a cloud goddess. But later Athamas became enamoured of Ino, the daughter of Cadmus, and neglected Nephele, who disappeared in anger. Athamas and Ino incurred the wrath of the goddess Hera because Ino had nursed the god Dionysus (q.v.). Athamas went mad and slew one of his sons, Learchus; Ino, to escape, threw herself into the sea with her other son, Melicertes. Both were afterward worshipped as marine divinitiesâ€”Ino as Leucothea, Melicertes as Palaemon. Athamas fled from Boeotia and finally settled at Phthiotis in Thessaly. The legend perhaps reflected a custom of human sacrifice among the Minyans. (See also Argonaut.)
