Wendi, Wade-Giles romanization Wen Ti, also called Wen Chang or Wen Chang Dijun,  the Chinese god of literature, whose chief heavenly task, assigned by the Jade Emperor (Yudi), is to keep a log of men of letters so that he can mete out rewards and punishments to each according to merit. He also maintains a register of the titles and honours each writer has received.
Among numerous legends about Wendi, he is said to have had 17 reincarnations, during the ninth of which he appeared on earth as Zhang Ya. Some say he lived during Tang dynasty times (618â€“907 ce), others say during the 3rd or 4th century or even earlier. In any case, his brilliant writing led to his canonization during the Tang dynasty and to his appointment as lord of literature in the 13th century. Because Zhang is said to have lived at Zitong in Sichuan province, persons of that region worship him under the title Zitongshen (Spirit of Zitong).
In representations, Wendi usually sits, wears a mandarin robe, and holds a sceptre. He is flanked by a male and a female servant, one called Tian Long (Heavenly Deaf One), the other Di Ya (Earthly Mute). The names suggest that Wendi must turn a deaf ear to those who inquire about the secrets of literature, for such a topic necessarily leaves one speechless.
Wendi has two assistants, Kuei Xing, the god of examinations, with whom he is sometimes confused, and Zhu Yi, whose name signifies Red Coat.
