Paean,  solemn choral lyric of invocation, joy, or triumph, originating in ancient Greece, where it was addressed to Apollo in his guise as Paean, physician to the gods. In the Mycenaean Linear B tablets from the late 2nd millennium bc, the word pa-ja-wo-ne is used as a name for a healer god. This god’s name was later associated with Apollo and his son Asclepius.
Paeans were sung at banquets (following the boisterous dithyrambs), at festivals honouring Apollo, and at public funerals. Armies sang them while on the march and before going into battle, after a victory, and when a fleet was leaving a harbour. The term paean is used to refer to a literary genre found in Homer’s Iliad and in the poems of Archilochus (7th century bc). Ancient scholars mentioned as authors of paeans include Alcman (7th century bc) and other poets who wrote in Sparta, where the cult of Apollo was practiced with special devotion. From the 5th century bc there survive fragments of paeans by Pindar (who was especially fond of the Pythian Apollo of Delphi), Bacchylides, and the tragic playwright Sophocles, who composed a paean to Coronis (the mortal mother of Asclepius), who was killed by Apollo or his twin, Artemis, for being unfaithful.
