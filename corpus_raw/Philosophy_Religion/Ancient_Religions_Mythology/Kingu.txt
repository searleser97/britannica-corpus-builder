Kingu,  in Babylonian mythology, the consort of Tiamat. The creation epic Enuma elish tells how Tiamat, determined to destroy the other gods, created a mighty army and set Kingu at its head. When Kingu saw Marduk coming against him, however, he fled. After Tiamatâ€™s defeat, Kingu was taken captive and executed; the god Enki (Ea) created humans from his blood.
