Consus,  ancient Italian deity, cult partner of the goddess of abundance, Ops. His name was derived from condere (“to store away”), and he was probably the god of grain storage. He had an altar at the first turn at the southeast end of the racetrack in the Circus Maximus. The altar was underground and exposed for sacrifice only on his festival days—July 7, August 2, and presumably December 15 (Consualia). On those days, horses and mules were crowned with garlands and were given rest from work, and the pontifices presided at horse and chariot races (in which mules took the place of horses). In later times, Consus sank to the level of a secondary and rather obscure deity.
