Conn Cétchathach, (Irish), English Conn of the Hundred Battles,  (flourished 2nd century ad), in Irish tradition, the first of a line of Irish kings that survived into the 11th century. He is said to have ruled a kingdom covering most of the northern half of the island.
Because Conn’s exploits are recorded only in heroic sagas, some historians regard him as a poetical invention. Others point to the use of the Gaelic phrase Leth Cuinn (“Conn’s Half”) as proof that he was a historical figure who held sway over Ireland north of present Dublin. According to these scholars, his power was concentrated in Meath (in east-central Ireland) and Connaught. Evidently he failed to win the allegiance of southern Ireland, which was ruled by Eóghan (or Mog Nuadat) and called Leth Moga (“Mog’s Half”). In Irish genealogy Conn is held to be the ancestor of Niall of the Nine Hostages (reigned 379–405), who founded the Uí Néill, the greatest dynasty in Irish history.
