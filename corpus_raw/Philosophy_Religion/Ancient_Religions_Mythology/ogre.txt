Ogre, feminine ogress,  a hideous giant represented in fairy tales and folklore as feeding on human beings. The word gained popularity from its use in the late 17th century by Charles Perrault, the author of Contes de ma mère l’oye (Tales of Mother Goose). Since then, ogres have appeared in many works, including “Tom Thumb”; “Hansel and Gretel,” where the witch is a type of ogre because she intends to eat the children; and “Little Red Riding Hood,” where the wolf resembles an ogre. The Cyclops of myth and heroic literature who devours humans is a form of ogre.
The idea of the ogre can also be seen, more broadly, in a metaphoric sense in literature. The seducer who devours his or her victims in a sexual sense is a kind of ogre, as is a political tyrant or dictator who controls and exploits others and in a sense swallows them up. The dictator causes lives to be consumed through promulgating wars and acts of brutality such as those perpetrated by the Nazi regime. The association of ogres with Nazis was made in Michel Tournier’s novel Le Roi des aulnes (1970; The Ogre). Other modern works dealing with ogres are L’Ogre (1973) by Jacques Chessex and Nacer Khemir’s L’Ogresse (1975), a collection of Tunisian tales.
