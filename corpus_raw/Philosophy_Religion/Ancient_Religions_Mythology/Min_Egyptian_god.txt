Min,  in ancient Egyptian religion, a god of fertility and harvest, embodiment of the masculine principle; he was also worshipped as the Lord of the Eastern Desert. His cult originated in predynastic times (4th millennium bce). Min was represented with phallus erect, a flail in his raised right hand. His cult was strongest in Coptos and Akhmīm (Panopolis), where in his honour great festivals were held celebrating his “coming forth,” with public processions and presentation of offerings. The lettuce was his sacred plant.
