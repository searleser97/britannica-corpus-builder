Erechtheus,  legendary king and probably also a divinity of Athens. According to the Iliad, he was born from the corn land and raised by the goddess Athena, who established him in her temple at Athens. In later times only a great snake was thought to share the temple with Athena, and there is evidence that Erechtheus was or became a snake; that is, an earth or ancestor spirit.
The earliest Athenian kings tended to have similar names suggesting a connection with the earth (chthōn; e.g., Erichthonius, Erysichthon), to have been born of the earth, raised by Athena, and to have something serpentine about them. Snakes were often earth or ancestor spirits, so that Athena’s sharing her temple with Erechtheus, whom she herself nurtured, may have been the mythical way of expressing her guardianship of the ancient royal house of Athens and of the land itself and its fertility, with which ancient kingship was intimately connected.
In his lost play Erechtheus, Euripides gave that king three daughters, one of whom was appropriately named Chthonia. At war with neighbouring Eleusis and its ally King Eumolpus, Erechtheus learned from the god Apollo that Athens would win if he sacrificed his daughter. He sacrificed Chthonia, and her sisters insisted on sharing her fate. Erechtheus won the battle, but, in the moment of victory, he was destroyed by Poseidon or by a thunderbolt from Zeus. In early times, death by thunderbolt was believed to be a prelude to a privileged afterlife.
