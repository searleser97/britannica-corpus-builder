Myō-ō,  in the Buddhist mythology of Japan, fierce protective deities, corresponding to the Sanskrit Vidyaraja (“King of Knowledge”), worshiped mainly by the Shingon sect. They take on a ferocious appearance in order to frighten away evil spirits and to destroy ignorance and ugly passions. They are depicted with angry expressions, with a third eye in the middle of their foreheads, and surrounded by flames.
The five great Myō-ō, popularly called Godaison, are the agents of the five Buddhas. Of these, Fudō Myō-ō, the fierce form of the Buddha Vairocana, is the most important and occupies the central position. Go Sansei, the fierce form of Akshobhya, reigns in the east; Dai Itoku, a form of Amitabha, in the west; Gundari-yasha, a form of Ratnasambhava, in the south; and Kongō-yasha, a form of Amoghasiddhi, in the north. Other prominent Myō-ō are the god of love, Aizen Myō-ō, and Kujaku Myō-ō, who sits on a peacock.
