Mag Tuired, also spelled Moytura,  mythical plain in Ireland, which was the scene of two important battles. The first battle was between the Fir Bolg and the Tuatha Dé Danann, or race of gods. In this battle the Dé Danann overcame the Fir Bolg and won Ireland for themselves, but Nuadu, the king of the gods, lost his hand in the battle. Because of this flaw, he was no longer permitted to be king. Bres, the beautiful son of a goddess and a Fomoire king, was chosen to rule in Nuadu’s stead. Bres’s reign was not successful because of his lack of generosity and kingly qualities. Nuadu was given a functional human hand by Mirach (see Dian Cécht), and Bres was overthrown. Bres went to his father’s family for aid and led a great army against the gods in the second battle of Mag Tuired. The gods had for a leader Lugh (see Lugus), one of the most important Celtic gods, who won the battle and killed Balor, the king of the Fomoire. The battle marks an end to the threat of the Fomoire in Irish myths and sagas.
