Gaspar, or Casper,  legendary figure, said to have been one of the Magi who paid homage to the infant Jesus. Although their names are not recorded in the biblical account, the names of three Magi—Bithisarea, Melichior, and Gathaspa—appeared in a chronicle known as the Excerpta latina barbari in about the 8th century; they have become known most commonly as Balthasar, Melchior, and Gaspar (or Casper). According to Western church tradition, Gaspar is often represented as a king of India and is usually said to have given the gift of frankincense to the Christ Child. In art he is frequently depicted with a reddish beard. The three named Magi are venerated as saints and martyrs and are celebrated on the Feast of the Epiphany in the West.
