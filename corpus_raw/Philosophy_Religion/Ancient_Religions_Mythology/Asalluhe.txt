Asalluhe,  in Mesopotamian religion, Sumerian deity, city god of Ku’ara, near Eridu in the southern marshland region. Asalluhe was active with the god Enki (Akkadian: Ea) in rituals of lustration (purification) magic and was considered his son. He may have originally been a god of thundershowers and would thus have corresponded to the other Sumerian gods Ishkur and Ninurta. In incantations Asalluhe was usually the god who first called Enki’s attention to existing evils. He was later identified with Marduk of Babylon.
