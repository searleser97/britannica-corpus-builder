Tangun,   mythological first king of the Koreans, the grandson of Hwanin, the creator, and the son of Hwanung, who fathered his child by breathing on a beautiful young woman. Tangun reportedly became king in 2333 bc.
Legends about Tangun differ in detail. According to one account, Hwanung left heaven to rule Earth from atop Mt. T’aebaek (Daebaik). When a bear and a tiger expressed a wish to become human beings, he ordered the beasts into a cave for 100 days and gave orders that they were to eat only mugwort and garlic and avoid the sunlight. The tiger soon grew impatient and left the cave, but the bear remained and after three weeks was transformed into a beautiful woman. It was she who became the mother of Tangun. The myth is important inasmuch as it links the Korean people with a heavenly origin.
Tangun’s legendary association with agriculture has led to speculation that the myth is based on a historical leader who learned the secrets of the soil in the city-states of the Huang Ho (river) valley. Buddhism and Taoism clothed themselves with a Korean mantle by crediting Tangun with starting a national religion of Heavenly Teaching and with originating the Korean maxim Hongik-ingan (“Love humanity”). An altar on Kanghwa Island, which is said to have been built by Tangun himself, is periodically refurbished. Tangun’s birthday (“Opening of Heaven Day”) on the 3rd day of the 10th month is a holiday for schoolchildren.
