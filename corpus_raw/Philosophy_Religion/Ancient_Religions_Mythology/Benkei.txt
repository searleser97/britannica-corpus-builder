Benkei,  (died 1189, Japan), warrior-monk whose legendary superhuman exploits in the service of his master, the famous warrior Minamoto Yoshitsune, made him one of the most popular figures in Japanese history and a favourite in many traditional stories and plays and even in motion pictures.
Although his name appears twice in documents from the period, thus affirming his actual existence, Benkei is better known as a legendary figure. He is said to have met his master while attempting to collect 1,000 swords from passersby whom he nightly challenged to duels on the Gojō Bridge in the capital city of Kyōto. Having collected 999 swords, he was foiled in his attempt for the 1,000th by Yoshitsune, whose follower he then became.
After ingeniously aiding his master in many battles, Benkei is said to have died defending Yoshitsune, who was surrounded and forced to commit suicide at the Battle of Koromogawa. According to legend, Benkei’s body, which was pierced with arrows, remained erect, even after death.
