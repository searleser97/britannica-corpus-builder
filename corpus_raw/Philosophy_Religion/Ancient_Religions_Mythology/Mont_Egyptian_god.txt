Montu, also spelled Mont, Monthu, or Mentu,  in ancient Egyptian religion, god of the 4th Upper Egyptian nome (province), whose original capital of Hermonthis (present-day Armant) was replaced by Thebes during the 11th dynasty (2081–1939 bce). Montu was a god of war. In addition to falcons, a bull was his sacred animal; from the 30th dynasty (380–343 bce), this bull, the Buchis bull, received an elaborate cult. Montu was represented as a man with a falcon’s head, wearing a crown of two plumes with a double uraeus (rearing cobra) on his forehead. He had important temple complexes at Karnak in Thebes and at Hermonthis, Al-Ṭūd, and Al-Mādamūd in the Theban area, all of which expanded greatly in the period of Roman rule.
