Ossian, Gaelic Oisín,  the Irish warrior-poet of the Fenian cycle of hero tales about Finn MacCumhaill (MacCool) and his war band, the Fianna Éireann. The name Ossian became known throughout Europe in 1762, when the Scottish poet James Macpherson “discovered” and published the poems of Oisín, first with the epic Fingal and the following year with Temora; both of these works were supposedly translations from 3rd-century Gaelic originals. Actually, although based in part on genuine Gaelic ballads, the works were largely the invention of Macpherson and were full of similarities to Homer, John Milton, and the Bible. These so-called poems of Ossian won wide acclaim and were a central influence in the early Romantic movement. J.W. von Goethe was one of their many admirers, but they aroused the suspicions of some critics, such as Samuel Johnson. They infuriated Irish scholars because they mixed Fenian and Ulster legends indiscriminately and because Macpherson claimed that the Irish heroes were Caledonians and therefore a glory to Scotland’s past, rather than to Ireland’s.
The Ossianic controversy was finally settled in the late 19th century, when it was demonstrated that the only Gaelic “originals” that Macpherson had produced were poor-quality Gaelic translations of his own English compositions. The name Ossian, popularized by Macpherson, superseded Oisín, though they are often used interchangeably. The term Ossianic ballads refers to genuine late Gaelic poems that form part of the common Scots-Irish tradition and should not be confused with the romanticized epics of “Ossian.”
