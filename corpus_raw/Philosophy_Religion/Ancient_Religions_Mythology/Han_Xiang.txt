Han Xiang, Wade-Giles romanization Han Hsiang,  in Chinese mythology, one of the Baxian, the Eight Immortals of Daoism. He desired to make flowers bloom in an instant and to produce fine-tasting wine without using grain. When his uncle scoffed at the idea, Han Xiang performed the impossible before his uncle’s eyes: flowers suddenly appeared in bloom from a clod of earth. In addition, a mysterious poem of 14 golden characters was seen on the leaves—a prophecy that was only later understood when the uncle was driven into exile.
Han Xiang usually is depicted holding a bouquet or basket of flowers, a hoe, and a mushroom of immortality. He is said to have been converted to Daoism (c. 9th century ce) by Lu Dongbin, another Immortal, but all attempts to convert his wife ended in failure.
