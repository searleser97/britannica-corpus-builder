Kubera,  in Hindu mythology, the king of the yakshas (nature spirits) and the god of wealth. He is associated with the earth, mountains, all treasures such as minerals and jewels that lie underground, and riches in general. According to most accounts, he first lived in Lanka (Sri Lanka), but his palace was taken away from him by his half brother, Ravana, and he now resides in a beautiful mountain residence near the god Shivaâ€™s home on Mount Kailasa, where he is attended by all manner of demigods.
Kubera is the guardian of the north and is usually depicted as a dwarfish figure with a large paunch, holding a money bag or a pomegranate, sometimes riding on a man. Also known as Vaishravana and Jambhala, he is a popular figure in Buddhist and Jain mythology as well. In Buddhist sculptures he is often shown accompanied by a mongoose.
