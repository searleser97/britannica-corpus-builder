Hu, Sia, and Heh,  in Egyptian religion, deified abstractions personifying, respectively, “creative command” (or “authoritative utterance”), “perception” (or “intelligence”), and “eternity.” They were all essential forces in the creation and continuance of the cosmos. Hu and Sia served as crew members in the solar bark of the sun god Re. They were represented in an undistinctive form as bearded men and also served as bearers of the eye of the god Horus. In the text known as the “Memphite Theology,” they personified the tongue and the heart of the god Ptah. They were also regarded as being two of the divine attributes of every king.
Heh was the personification of infinite space and was portrayed as a squatting man with his arms outspread, bearing the symbols of many years of life and of happiness.
