Eumolpus,  mythical ancestor of the priestly clan of the Eumolpids at Eleusis, a town west of Athens, and the site of the Eleusinian Mysteries, the best known of the Greek mystery cults. His name (meaning “good” or “strong singer”; i.e., a priest who could chant his litanies clearly and well) was a personification of the clan’s hereditary functions. His legend fluctuated so greatly that three identities for Eumolpus have been assumed:
1. Being a “sweet singer,” he was connected with Thrace, the country of Orpheus. He was the son of the god Poseidon and Chione (Snow Girl), daughter of the north wind, Boreas; after various adventures he became king in Thrace but was killed while helping the Eleusinians in their war against Erectheus of Athens.
2. As one of the originators of the Eleusinian Mysteries, he was an Eleusinian, a son of Earth (Ge), father of Keryx, and the mythical ancestor of the Kerykes (Heralds).
3. Because Orpheus and his followers were closely connected with mysteries of all sorts, Eumolpus was believed to be the son, father, or pupil of Musaeus, a mythical singer closely allied with Orpheus.
