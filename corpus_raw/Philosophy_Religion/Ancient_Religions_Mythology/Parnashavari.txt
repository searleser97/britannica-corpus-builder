Parnashavari, Sanskrit Parṇaśavarī,  in Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism, a goddess distinguished by the girdle of leaves she wears. She is known as Lo-ma-gyon-ma in Tibet and as Hiyōi in Japan. Parnashavari is apparently derived from an aboriginal deity, and one of her titles is Sarvashavaranam Bhagavati, or “goddess of all the Shavaras” (a tribe in eastern India). Invoked to fight disease and epidemics, she is represented with a smiling but irritated expression, stamping on personified figures of fever and smallpox.
