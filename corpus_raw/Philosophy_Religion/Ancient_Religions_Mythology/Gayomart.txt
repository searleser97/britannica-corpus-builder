Gayōmart, Avestan Gayō Maretan (“Mortal Life”),  in later Zoroastrian creation literature, the first man, and the progenitor of mankind. Gayōmart’s spirit, with that of the primeval ox, lived for 3,000 years during the period in which creation was only spiritual. His mere existence immobilized Ahriman, the evil spirit who wanted to invade creation. Then Ahura Mazdā created Gayōmart incarnate—white and brilliant, shining like the sun—and put in him and the primeval ox, alone of all created things, a seed whose origin was in fire.
Ahura Mazdā gave Gayōmart the boon of sleep for respite from the onslaught of Ahriman. But after 30 years of attacks, Ahriman destroyed Gayōmart. His body became the Earth’s metals and minerals. Gold was his seed, and from it sprung the human race.
