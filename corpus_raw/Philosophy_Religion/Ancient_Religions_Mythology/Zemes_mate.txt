Zemes māte, (Latvian), Lithuanian Žemyna,  the Earth Mother of Baltic religion. Zemes māte represents the female aspect of nature and the source of all life—human, animal, and plant. Interacting with Dievs (the sky), Zemes māte stimulates and protects the power of life. Libations of beer were offered to her at the opening of every festival, and such products of the earth as bread, ale, and herbs were buried in the ground or thrown into rivers and lakes or tied to trees in her honour. The birth of a child was also celebrated with an offering to the Earth Mother. The various functions of Zemes māte were eventually assumed by demigoddesses of forests, fields, stones, animals, water, and, in the Christian era, by the Virgin Mary.
The male counterpart of Zemes māte is Zemnieks (Latvian), known as Žemininkas, or Žemėpatis, among the Lithuanians. Žemėpatis was considered the brother of Žemyna and functioned as master of the earth and guardian of farms.
