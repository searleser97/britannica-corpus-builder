Honos,  ancient Roman deified abstraction of honour, particularly as a military virtue. The earliest shrine of this deity in Rome was perhaps built not earlier than the 3rd century bc and was located just outside the Colline Gate on the north side of the city. A double temple of Honos and Virtus stood outside the Capena Gate on the south side. Originally a temple to Honos alone, built by Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (later called Cunctator) in 234 bc, it was expanded by Marcus Claudius Marcellus near the end of the 3rd century bc and contained many works of art that had been taken from Syracuse when Marcellus captured that city (212). Another temple, built by Gaius Marius, was located on the Velia, near Marius’s house on the Via Sacra (“Sacred Way”).
