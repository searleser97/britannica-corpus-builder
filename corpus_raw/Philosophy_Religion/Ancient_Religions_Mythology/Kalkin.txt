Kalkin, also called Kalki,  final avatar (incarnation) of the Hindu god Vishnu, who is yet to appear. At the end of the present Kali yuga (age), when virtue and dharma have disappeared and the world is ruled by the unjust, Kalkin will appear to destroy the wicked and to usher in a new age. He will be seated on a white horse with a naked sword in his hand, blazing like a comet. He is less commonly represented in painting and sculpture than the other avatars of Vishnu and is shown either on horseback or accompanied by his horse. According to some legends of the end of the world, Kalkinâ€™s horse will stamp the earth with its right foot, causing the tortoise which supports the world to drop into the deep. Then the gods will restore the earth once again to its former purity.
