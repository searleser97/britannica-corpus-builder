Leib-olmai, (Sami: “Alder Man”)  in Sami religion and folklore, forest deity who was considered the guardian of wild animals, especially bears. Hunters made offerings of small bows and arrows to Leib-olmai to ensure success in the chase. Leib also means “blood,” and the red juice from alder bark, symbolic of blood, was splattered over the hunters as they returned with a dead bear. As a god of the hunters, Leib-olmai despised women. As a consequence, hunting weapons were considered taboo for women, and preparations for the hunt were undertaken without the presence of women.
