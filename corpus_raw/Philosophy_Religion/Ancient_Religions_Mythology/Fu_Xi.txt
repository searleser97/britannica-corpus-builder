Fu Xi, Wade-Giles romanization Fu Hsi, formally Tai Hao (Chinese: “The Great Bright One”), also called Bao Xi or Mi Xi,  first mythical emperor of China. His miraculous birth, as a divine being with a serpent’s body, is said to have occurred in the 29th century bce. Some representations show him as a leaf-wreathed head growing out of a mountain or as a man clothed with animal skins. Fu Xi is said to have discovered the famous Chinese trigrams (bagua) used in divination (notably in the Yijing) and thus to have contributed, in some uncertain way, to the development of the Chinese writing system. He domesticated animals, taught his people to cook, to fish with nets, and to hunt with weapons made of iron. He likewise instituted marriage and offered the first open-air sacrifice to heaven. A stone tablet dated 160 ce depicts him with Nü Gua, a frequent companion, who was either his wife or his sister.
