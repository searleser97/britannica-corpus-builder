Nantosuelta,  in Celtic religion, a goddess worshipped primarily in Gaul and sometimes portrayed together with Sucellus (“Good Striker”), the Gaulish god of agriculture. Her name was reconstructed by linguists and cannot be definitely translated, yet two accepted approximations of its meaning in Proto-Celtic are “She of the Winding River” and “She of the Sun-drenched Valley.” One of her attributes was the raven, which thus linked her with the Irish goddess Morrígan and her two companions. The raven may also connote an association with the home, with fertility, and also with the dead. She was sometimes shown holding a small house on the end of a pole, which may have been either a dovecote or a model of a Gallo-Roman temple. In the Gaulish iconography of Sucellus and Nantosuelta there appears to have been a continental parallel with the Irish divine couple, the Dagda (Good God) and Morrígan (Queen of Demons), who, like Nantosuelta, also had clear aquatic associations.
