Enarean,  member of an ancient group of magicians and soothsayers, most likely eunuchs, who spoke in high-pitched voices and dressed as women. All that is known of them appears in the writings of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus (flourished 5th century bce). They claimed that a goddess, interpreted by Herodotus as Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of beauty, taught them the art of prophecy. Their methods were to plait the bark of trees, lay willow twigs on the ground, and entwine the leaves of a lime tree around their fingers. An oath sworn “by the king’s hearth” was so solemn that if the king suffered any affliction, enareans failing to divine who broke the oath were burned to death. The Scythians, an Iranian people living in the 1st millennium bce, believed that the feminine characteristics of the enareans had been inflicted on them by the Great Goddess as punishment for desecrating her shrine at Ashqelon.
