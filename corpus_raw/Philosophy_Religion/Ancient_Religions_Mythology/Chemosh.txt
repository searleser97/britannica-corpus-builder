Chemosh,  ancient West Semitic deity, revered by the Moabites as their supreme god. Little is known about Chemosh; although King Solomon of Israel built a sanctuary to him east of Jerusalem (1 Kings 11:7), the shrine was later demolished by King Josiah (2 Kings 23:13). The goddess Astarte was probably the cult partner of Chemosh. On the famous Moabite Stone, written by Mesha ø, a 9th-century bc king of Moab, Chemosh received prominent mention as the deity who brought victory to the Moabites in their battle against the Israelites.
