Aeolus,   in the works of Homer, controller of the winds and ruler of the floating island of Aeolia. Because his children met no one outside their own family, Aeolus allowed them to mate with one another, to the relief of Canace and Macareus, who were already lovers. Aeolus made the brothers draw lots for the sisters; in some accounts—possibly confusing him with King Macar—Macareus drew the wrong sister, so that he left home and founded Lesbos. 
In the Odyssey Aeolus gave Odysseus a favourable wind and a bag in which the unfavourable winds were confined. Odysseus’ companions opened the bag; the winds escaped and drove them back to the island. Although he appears as a human in Homer, Aeolus later was described as a minor god. The island of Aeolia is identified with present-day Lipari, off the coast of Sicily.
