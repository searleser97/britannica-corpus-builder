Ogma,  ancient Irish god portrayed as a swarthy man whose battle ardor was so great that he had to be chained and held back by other warriors until the right moment for military action occurred. Ogham script, an Irish writing system dating from the 4th century ce, seems to have been named for him, suggesting that, like his Celtic equivalent Ogmios, he was a god of eloquence.
