Inti, also called Apu-punchau,  in Inca religion, the sun god; he was believed to be the ancestor of the Incas. Inti was at the head of the state cult, and his worship was imposed throughout the Inca empire. He was usually represented in human form, his face portrayed as a gold disk from which rays and flames extended. Inti’s sister and consort was the moon, Mama-Kilya (or Mama-Quilla), who was portrayed as a silver disk with human features. Among the 20th-century Quechua people, Inti is occasionally confused with Christ or God.
Inti-raymi was one of a cycle of raymi, or “festivals.” Held in June (after the Spanish conquest, in May or June to coincide with the feast of Corpus Christi), Inti-raymi honoured the sun god and was celebrated with animal sacrifices and ritual dances.
