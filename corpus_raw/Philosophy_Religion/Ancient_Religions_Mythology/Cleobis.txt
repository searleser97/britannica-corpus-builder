Cleobis and Biton,  Biton also spelled Bito,  in Greek legend, as recounted by Herodotus, the sons of Cydippe (who was identified by Cicero, in Tusculan Disputations, as the priestess of Hera, queen of the gods). At Argos, they were noted for their filial devotion and for their athletic prowess and strength. During an Argive festival honouring Hera, Cydippe was called to the temple. When her oxteam could not be found, the brothers took up the yoke of the ceremonial wagon and conveyed her there themselves.
Cydippe begged the goddess to grant them, as a reward for their piety, whatever was best for mortal men. They feasted and slept that night in the temple, waiting to take their mother home on the following day, but they never awakened. In Herodotus’s version their story is told by the Athenian statesman Solon to Croesus, who wants examples of human happiness. Herodotus also mentions that the Argives dedicated statues of the young men at Apollo’s oracle at Delphi; archaeologists have discovered statues that some scholars believe represent those described by Herodotus.
