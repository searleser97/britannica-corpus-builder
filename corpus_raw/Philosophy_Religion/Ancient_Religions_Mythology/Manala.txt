Manala,   in Finnish mythology, the realm of the dead. The word is possibly derived from the compound maan-ala, “the space (or area) under the earth.” It is also called Tuonela, the realm of Tuoni, and Pohjola, derived from the word pohja, meaning “bottom” and also “north.”
The Finnish underworld and related concepts among other Finno-Ugric peoples, such as the yabme-aimo of the Sami, are the product of hundreds of years of various influences and, as a result, do not provide a consistent cosmology. Manala is often reached by crossing a fiery stream, the river of death, either over a narrow bridge or by a boat brought by a denizen of the otherworld. Manala itself is a dark, gloomy place but not a place of everlasting torment like the Christian hell. It is ruled by the goddess Louhi, who is a fierce haglike creature with several vaguely defined sons, daughters, and servants in her retinue. Pohjola is similarly found in various forms in the underworld, but it is also to the north and at the outer edges of the universe, outside the known world of man. In a more concrete sense the realm of the dead was where the dead were buried, and many of the descriptions of the underworld depict the coffins and funerary shelters erected at the burial sites.
