Blodeuedd, (Welsh: “Flower-Form”) , also called Blodeuwedd,  in the Welsh collection of stories called the Mabinogion, a beautiful girl fashioned from flowers as a wife for Lleu Llaw Gyffes (see Lugus). Lleu’s mother had put a curse on him that he would have no wife, and Blodeuedd was created to subvert the curse; she was unfaithful, however, and conspired with a lover to kill Lleu. The attempt failed and she was changed into an owl as a punishment.
