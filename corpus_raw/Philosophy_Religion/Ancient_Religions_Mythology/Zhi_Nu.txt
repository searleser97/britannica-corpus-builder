Zhi Nü, Wade-Giles romanization Chih Nü,  in Chinese mythology, the heavenly weaving maiden who used clouds to spin seamless robes of brocade for her father, the Jade Emperor (Yudi). Granted permission to visit the earth, Zhi Nü fell in love with Niu Lang, the cowherd, and was married to him. For a long time Zhi Nü was so deeply in love that she had no thoughts of heaven. Finally she returned to her heavenly home where her husband joined her. The emperor, irate that his daughter had neglected her weaving for so long, placed the lovers on opposite sides of the impassable Milky Way. Only once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, are they allowed to meet. On that day magpies fly to the Milky Way to form a bridge so that the longing lovers can cross over to renew mutual protestations of their undying love for each other. Their happy tears often cause rain on earth. In some parts of China an annual festival allows lovers to meet in honour of these astral deities. Zhi Nü belongs to the constellation Lyra, Niu Lang to Aquila.
