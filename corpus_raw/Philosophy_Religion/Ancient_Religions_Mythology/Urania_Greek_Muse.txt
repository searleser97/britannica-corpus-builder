Urania, (Greek: “Heavenly”)  in Greek religion, one of the nine Muses, patron of astronomy. In some accounts she was the mother of Linus the musician (in other versions, his mother is the Muse Calliope); the father was either Hermes or Amphimarus, son of Poseidon. Urania was also occasionally used as a byname for Aphrodite. Her attributes were the globe and compass.
