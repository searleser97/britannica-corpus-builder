Ayyappan, also called Sartavu or Śāsta,  in Hinduism, a deity who is always celibate, generally depicted in a yogic posture, with a bell around his neck. His most-prominent shrine is at Shabarimalai, in the southern Indian state of Kerala, where he is most popular, though the neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka also house many Ayyappan temples. Ayyappan may bear a historical relationship to the tutelary deity Aiyanar of Tamil Nadu.
The most-public aspect of the worship of Ayyappan is the annual pilgrimage to Shabarimalai, in which only men, preadolescent girls, and postmenopausal women are allowed to participate. Prior to the journey, pilgrims are required to observe strict vows of celibacy and abstain from meat and intoxicants for a period of, traditionally, 41 days. Pilgrims climb barefoot to the hilltop where the shrine is located, and during the pilgrimage linguistic and economic differences among participants are minimized. A late Sanskrit text describes Ayyappan as the son of Shiva and Vishnu (with the latter in his form as the enchantress Mohini). Abandoned by his parents with but a bell around his neck, he was adopted by a Pantalam king of Kerala, and, soon after, his divinity was recognized and a shrine erected to him. Other tales and songs in Malayalam and Kodagu describe his adoption by a local king. They focus on his later life, in which he grew to be a renowned warrior who first set out to defeat and was subsequently worshipped by the Muslim chieftain Vavar (to whom there is a shrine en route to Shabarimalai).
