Aloadae,  in Greek legend, the twin sons of Iphimedia, the wife of Aloeus, by the god Poseidon. Named Otus and Ephialtes, the Aloadae were of extraordinary strength and stature. The Aloadae attacked the Olympian gods and tried to storm heaven itself, but Apollo destroyed them before they reached manhood. In a later myth, when they sought Artemis (goddess of wild animals, vegetation, and childbirth) and Hera (wife of Zeus) in marriage, Artemis appeared between them in the shape of a stag; they tried to kill the stag but instead accidentally slew each other.
