Evander,  in Classical mythology, a migrant from Pallantium in Arcadia (central part of the Peloponnesus) who settled in Italy and founded a town named Pallantion, after his native place. The site of the town, at Rome, became known as the Palatine Hill, for his son Pallas and daughter Pallantia. Evander was the son of the goddess Carmentis (or Carmenta) and the god Hermes. Traditionally he instituted the Lupercalia (q.v.) and introduced some of the blessings of civilization, including writing. He hospitably received the heroes Hercules and Aeneas.
