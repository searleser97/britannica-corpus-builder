Pachacamac,   creator deity worshipped by the pre-Inca maritime population of Peru; it was also the name of a pilgrimage site in the Lurín Valley (south of Lima) dedicated to the god and revered for many centuries. After the Incas conquered the coast, they did not attempt to replace the ancient and deeply rooted worship of Pachacamac but instead incorporated him into their own pantheon. Pachacamac was believed to be a god of fire and a son of the sun god; he rejuvenated the world originally created by the god Viracocha and taught men the crafts. Pachacamac was also believed to be invisible and thus was never represented in art.
The ruins of the shrine in the Lurín Valley include several pyramids and temples and are partially restored. The site may have served as the central city of a coastal “kingdom” from c. 1000 to c. 1440.
