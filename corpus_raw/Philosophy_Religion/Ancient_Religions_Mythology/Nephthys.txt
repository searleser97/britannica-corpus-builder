Nephthys,  Greek form of the name of the Egyptian goddess Nebtho. She seems to have been artificially created in apposition to Isis to be a second sister to the god Osiris and wife to his brother Set (Setekh). She plays practically no part outside the myth of Osiris, in which her only function is to bewail with Isis the death of Osiris. The meaning of her name (“Mistress of the Castle”) suggests that she is a mere personification of Osiris’s residence, while Isis (Egyptian Ese, “Seat”) personifies his throne.
