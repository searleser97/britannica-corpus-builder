Susanoo, in full Susanoo no Mikoto, also spelled Susanowo,  (Japanese: Impetuous Male), in Japanese mythology, the storm god, younger brother of the sun goddess Amaterasu. He was born as his father Izanagi washed his nose. Susanoo, having been granted charge of the sea plain, was driven out of heaven because of his outrageous behaviour at his sister’s court.
Susanoo descended into the land of Izumo in western Japan and killed an eight-headed dragon that had been terrorizing the countryside. From the tail of the dragon he recovered the marvelous sword Kusanagi that he presented to his sister and that later came to form part of the Imperial Treasures of Japan. Susanoo married the girl he had rescued from the dragon, and together they produced many generations of gods. The most famous of their offspring was Ōkuninushi, the “Master of the Great Land” (Izumo).
