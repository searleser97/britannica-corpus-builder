Laima, also called Laima-dalia,   (from Lithuanian laimė, “happiness,” “luck”), in Baltic religion, the goddess of fate, generally associated with the linden tree. Together with Dievs, the sky, and Saule, the sun, Laima determines the length and fortune of human life. In the course of each life she helps arrange marriages, oversees weddings, protects pregnant women, and appears at childbirth to pronounce each infant’s destiny.
Revered as patroness of cows and horses, Laima decides the life span of plants and animals and determines the length of the day.
Three other demigoddesses with analogous functions are preserved in Latvian mythology—Dēkla, protector of babies, Kārta, spinner of the thread of life, and Māra, goddess of fertility.
