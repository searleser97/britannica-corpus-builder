Mer,   among the Cheremis and Udmurts (also called Votyaks), a district where people would gather periodically to hold religious festivals and perform sacrifices to nature gods. The word mer is derived from the Russian mir, “village community.” The people within the mer usually were of common origin; their customs were similar, and they may even have possessed names and ownership marks indicating clan relationship. The sacred groves in which the mer festivals were held had no separate fenced-in areas as did some of the other sacrificial groves and had no shrines or other fixed property in them. Several villages might gather at some ancient grove where their ancestors had worshiped in the past. Animal sacrifices were more plentiful at mers than at the other festivals, but mers were less frequent. Five or more years might lapse between the mer festivals. See also lud.
