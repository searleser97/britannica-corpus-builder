Hellanodikai,   in ancient Greece, Elean officials who served as judges of the Olympic Games and who became well known for enforcing laws of fairness. They also had the honour of presenting the crowns and palm branches to the champions. Selected from the ruling families of Elis, the judges served for only one program of games and were trained for several months in advance by the Elean magistrates. During the games they wore purple robes and sat in a special box at the southern end of the grounds. Several groups of lesser officials were under their jurisdiction.
