Mnevis, also called Menuis, Egyptian Nemur, Greek form of Merwer,  in ancient Egyptian religion, sacred bull deity worshipped at Heliopolis. As one of several sacred bulls in Egypt, he was most closely associated with the sun god Re-Atum. Although not attested with certainty until the Middle Kingdom (1938–c. 1630 bce), the Mnevis bull may be that which is referenced by the phrase “bull of Heliopolis,” which occurs in the Pyramid Texts. The Mnevis bull was either black or piebald in colour, and in sculptures and paintings he was represented with a solar disc between his horns.
