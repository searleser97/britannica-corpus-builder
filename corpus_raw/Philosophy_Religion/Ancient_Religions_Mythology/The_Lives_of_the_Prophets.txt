The Lives of the Prophets,  pseudepigraphal collection (not in any scriptural canon) of folk stories and legends about the major and minor biblical prophets and a number of other prophetic figures from the Old Testament books of I Kings, II Chronicles, and Nehemiah. The work demonstrates the popularity of religious and philosophical biography in the Mediterranean and Near Eastern areas during the Hellenistic period (3d century bc to 3d century ad) of Judaism.
Originally written in the 1st century ad in Hebrew, the Lives is extant only in a Greek translation and in Syriac, Latin, and Ethiopic translations made from the Greek. The original author (or authors) was a Jew, but the versions that have been preserved all show signs of Christian editing, especially of the messianic and iconographical material.
Each section uses legendary and biblical sources to summarize the life of a particular prophet. The Lives of the Prophets includes such typical Hellenistic religious motifs as miracles and divine epiphanies. Many of the stories are related to, if not dependent upon, other apocryphal worksâ€”e.g., the life of Isaiah resembles the Martyrdom of Isaiah, the life of Jeremiah recalls the account of the Ark of the Covenant in the Second Book of the Maccabees, and the life of Habakkuk is related to Bel and the Dragon in Additions to Daniel.
