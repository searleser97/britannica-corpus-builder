Hypsipyle,  in Greek legend, daughter of Dionysus’s son Thoas, king of the island of Lemnos. When the women of Lemnos, furious at their husbands’ betrayal, murdered all the men on the island, Hypsipyle hid her father and aided his escape. She became queen of the island and welcomed the Argonauts when they landed; eventually she bore twin sons to the Argonaut Jason. When the other women learned that she had spared her father, she was deposed and sold into slavery to Lycurgus, king of Nemea. One day, while she was acting as nurse to Opheltes, the king’s infant son, she left her charge in order to help the Seven Against Thebes find water; in her absence the child was bitten by a snake and died. (The seer Amphiaraus saw that this episode portended the failure of the expedition of the Seven.) Dionysus sent Hypsipyle’s sons, Euneos and Thoas, to rescue her from the ensuing danger; the Nemean Games were instituted in memory of the dead child.
Euripides’ tragedy Hypsipyle, of which a fragment survives, was based on this legend.
