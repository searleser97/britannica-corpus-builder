Lamashtu, (Akkadian), Sumerian Dimme,  in Mesopotamian religion, the most terrible of all female demons, daughter of the sky god Anu (Sumerian: An). She slew children and drank the blood of men and ate their flesh. The bearer of seven names, she was often described in incantations as the “seven witches.” Lamashtu perpetrated a variety of evil deeds: she disturbed sleep and brought nightmares; she killed foliage and infested rivers and streams; she bound the muscles of men, caused pregnant women to miscarry, and brought disease and sickness. Lamashtu was often portrayed on amulets as a lion- or bird-headed female figure kneeling on an ass; she held a double-headed serpent in each hand and suckled a dog at her right breast and a pig or another dog at her left breast.
