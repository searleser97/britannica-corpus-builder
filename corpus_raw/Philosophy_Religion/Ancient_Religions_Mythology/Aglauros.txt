Aglauros, also spelled Aglaurus,  in Greek mythology, eldest daughter of the Athenian king Cecrops.  Aglauros died with her sisters by leaping in fear from the Acropolis after seeing the infant Erichthonius, a human with a serpent’s tail. The Roman poet Ovid (Metamorphoses Book II), however, related that Aglauros was turned to stone by the god Mercury in retribution for her attempt to frustrate his abduction of Herse, Aglauros’ youngest sister. Aglauros and her sisters (Herse and Pandrosos) were apparently at first fertility deities. Aglauros had a sanctuary on the Acropolis in which young men of military age swore an oath to her as well as to Zeus and to other deities. The honour, however, may have stemmed from another legend—that Aglauros had sacrificed herself for the city during the war against Eleusis (see Erechtheus).
Aglauros had a daughter named Alcippe by the god of war, Ares. Alcippe was raped by Halirrhothius, a son of the god of the sea, Poseidon. Ares avenged the act and was tried before the gods on the Athens hill that later was named after him, the Areopagus. That place became the site of Athens’s criminal trials.
