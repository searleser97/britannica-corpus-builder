Men,  moon god worshiped widely in Asia Minor during Roman times and also in Attica from the 3rd century bc. Little is known of his origin, but he may have been connected with the Persian moon god Mao. His name was usually written together with a cult title, often an adjective denoting a locality, and his most frequent attributes were the pine cone, bucranium (ox skull), and chicken. He was represented as a male figure with a crescent moon behind his shoulders. A temple of Men has been excavated at Antioch in Pisidia (modern Yalva√ß, Turkey).
