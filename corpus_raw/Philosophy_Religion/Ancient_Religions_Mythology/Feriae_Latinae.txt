Feriae Latinae,   in Roman religion, the Festival of Jupiter Latiaris (Latialis), held in the spring and fall each year on Mons Albanus (Monte Cavo), in the Alban Hills near Rome. Apparently antedating the foundation of Rome, it eventually was observed by all 47 members of the Latin League.
The ceremony was the initial responsibility of each newly chosen pair of Roman consuls, who offered milk as a libation; the other cities sent cheese and sheep. A white heifer that had never been yoked was then sacrificed. Its flesh was consumed by the delegates of all the league communities on behalf of their constituents.
