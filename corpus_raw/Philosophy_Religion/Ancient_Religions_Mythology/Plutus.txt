Plutus,  in Greek religion, god of abundance or wealth, a personification of ploutos (Greek: “riches”). According to Hesiod, Plutus was born in Crete, the son of the goddess of fruitfulness, Demeter, and the Cretan Iasion. In art he appears chiefly as a child with a cornucopia, in company with Demeter and Persephone. In Aristophanes’ Plutus he is blind and cannot tell good from evil until his sight is restored. He was sometimes confused with Pluto (Hades), god of the underworld.
