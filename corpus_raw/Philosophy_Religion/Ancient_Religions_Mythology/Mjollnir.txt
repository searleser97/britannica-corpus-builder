Mjollnir, Old Norse Mjöllnir,  in Norse mythology, the hammer of the thunder god, Thor, and the symbol of his power. Forged by dwarfs, the hammer never failed Thor; he used it as a weapon to crash down on the heads of giants and as an instrument to hallow people and things. Mjollnir was stolen by the giant Thrym, who asked as ransom the hand of the goddess Freyja. When Freyja refused to go to Thrym, Thor masqueraded as her and succeeded in grabbing the hammer, which had been brought out to consecrate him as Thrym’s bride. Thor then slaughtered Thrym and the other giants with the hammer.
