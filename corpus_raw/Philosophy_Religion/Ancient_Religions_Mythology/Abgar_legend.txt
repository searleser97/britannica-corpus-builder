Abgar legend,   in early Christian times, a popular myth that Jesus had an exchange of letters with King Abgar V Ukkama of Osroene, whose capital was Edessa, a Mesopotamian city on the northern fringe of the Syrian plateau. According to the legend, the king, afflicted with leprosy, had heard of Jesusâ€™ miracles and wrote to Jesus acknowledging his divine mission, asking to be cured, and inviting him to come to Edessa as a safe refuge from persecution. In his reply, Jesus allegedly commended the king for his faith, expressed regret that his mission in life precluded a visit, but promised that after his Ascension into heaven a disciple would visit Edessa and heal the king.
A developed form of the legend exists in the Doctrine of Addai, a Syriac document containing suggestions of primitive Christianity in Edessa. In any event, the letters, probably composed early in the 4th century, have been considered spurious since the 5th century. They were translated from Syriac into Greek, Armenian, Latin, Arabic, and other ancient languages, clear evidence of the popularity of the legend.
