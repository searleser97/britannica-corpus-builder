Telemachus,  in Greek mythology, son of the Greek hero Odysseus and his wife, Penelope. When Telemachus reached manhood, he visited Pylos and Sparta in search of his wandering father. On his return, he found that Odysseus had reached home before him. Then father and son slew the suitors who had gathered around Penelope. According to later tradition, Telemachus married Circe (or Calypso) after Odysseus’ death.
François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon’s Les Aventures de Télémaque (1699), which set the fashion for novels about the education of princes or heroes, is about the trials of Telemachus, who is guided by Athena disguised as Mentor. (The character is the basis for the modern use of the word mentor.)
