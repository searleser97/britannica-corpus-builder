Orphic religion,  a Hellenistic mystery religion, thought to have been based on the teachings and songs of the legendary Greek musician Orpheus. No coherent description of such a religion can be constructed from historical evidence. Most scholars agree that by the 5th century bc there was at least an Orphic movement, with travelling priests who offered teaching and initiation, based on a body of legend and doctrine said to have been founded by Orpheus.
Part of the Orphic ritual is thought to have involved the mimed or actual dismemberment of an individual representing the god Dionysus, who was then seen to be reborn. Orphic eschatology laid great stress on rewards and punishment after the death of the body, the soul then being freed to achieve its true life.
