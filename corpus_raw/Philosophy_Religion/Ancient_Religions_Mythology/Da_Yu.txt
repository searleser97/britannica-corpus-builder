Da Yu, (Chinese: “Yu the Great”) Wade-Giles romanization Ta Yü,  in Chinese mythology, the Tamer of the Flood, a saviour-hero and reputed founder of China’s oldest dynasty, the Xia. One legend among many recounts Da Yu’s extraordinary birth: a man called Gun was given charge of controlling a great deluge. To dam the water, he stole from heaven what seems to have been a piece of magic soil. Angered by the theft, the Lord on High (Shangdi) issued an order for his execution. After three years Gun’s miraculously preserved body was slit open and a son brought forth. This was Da Yu who, after years of strenuous labour, provided outlets to the sea through dredging, with the aid of dragons, thus making the world suitable for human habitation.
