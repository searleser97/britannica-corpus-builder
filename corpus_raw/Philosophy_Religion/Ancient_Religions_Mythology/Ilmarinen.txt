Ilmarinen,  one of the chief deities in Finno-Ugric religion, functioning both as creator deity and as weather god. He forged the sampo, a world pillar that supports the sky, and hammered the firmament itself. He is often mentioned in mythic songs as working in a smithy with no door or windows and without any tools except those he magically creates from his own clothes, using his knee as an anvil. In this role he has similarities with the Sami Veralden-radien, who is also associated with the sampo.
In his capacity as weather deity, Ilmarinen is responsible for the giving of rain and wind. He performs a function similar to that of Biegg-olmai, the wind man of the Sami, who is represented by a statue with a shovel and club in his hands for scooping out snow, ice, or rain from his abode. The Sami of Finnmark in northern Norway use the name Ilmaris, referring to a deity who brings storms and bad weather. The earliest reference to Ilmarinen is the list of Finnish deities compiled in 1551 by Mikael Agricola (c. 1510â€“57), the Lutheran bishop who developed written Finnish. Agricola identified Ilmarinen specifically as a weather god who aids travelers on their journeys. Etymologically the word ilma can be connected with other Finno-Ugric words for sky, including the Votyak word im, the Zyryan word jen, and the Vogul word ilem.
