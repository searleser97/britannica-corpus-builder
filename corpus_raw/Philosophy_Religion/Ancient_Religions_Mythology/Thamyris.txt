Thamyris, also spelled Thamyras,  in Greek mythology, a Thracian poet who loved the beautiful youth Hyacinthus. Thamyrisâ€™ attentions, however, were rivaled by those of the god Apollo, who jealously reported to the Muses the boast by Thamyris that he could surpass them in song. In another version of the myth, he challenged the Muses to a contest; if he won, he was to enjoy the favours of all of them. But he lost, and they blinded him and took away his gift of song.
