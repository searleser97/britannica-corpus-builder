Ōkuninushi, in full Ōkuninushi No Mikota,  in the mythology of the Izumo branch of Shintō in Japan, the central hero, a son-in-law of the storm god, Susanoo.
Before becoming “Master of the Great Land,” Ōkuninushi underwent a series of ordeals, mainly at the hands of his many mischievous brothers. His compassionate advice to the suffering white hare of Inaba (who had been stripped of his fur by a crocodile) was rewarded by the hare, who helped to arrange his marriage with Yakami, the princess of Inaba. His chief consort was Princess Suseri, the daughter of Susanoo. They made their escape from Susanoo’s palace in the netherworld when Ōkuninushi tied the storm god’s hair to the rafters while he slept. Ōkuninushi took with him the storm god’s most precious possessions: his sword, lute, and bow and arrows. The lute brushed against a tree as it was being carried away and woke Susanoo, who followed in pursuit as far as the pass between the land of light and the land of darkness, then relented and forgave the couple.
Ōkuninushi then commenced to build the world with the help of the dwarf deity Sukunahikona. The two together formulated the arts of medicine and means of controlling disasters caused by birds and insects. He continued to rule Izumo until the appearance of the divine grandchild, Ninigi, when he turned over political rule to him while retaining control of “secret,” or religious, affairs. In modern Japanese folk belief he is venerated as a god who heals and who makes marriages happy.
