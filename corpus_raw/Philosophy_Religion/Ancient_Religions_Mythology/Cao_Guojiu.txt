Cao Guojiu, Wade-Giles romanization Tsâ€™ao Kuo-chiu,  in Chinese mythology, one of the Baxian, the Eight Immortals of Daoism. Cao is sometimes depicted in official robes and hat and carrying a tablet indicative of his rank and of his right to palace audiences. He was a man of exemplary character who often reminded a dissolute brother that though one can escape the laws of man, one cannot avoid the nets of heaven. In another tradition, however, Cao is said to have been in conflict with the law but mended his ways after his release from prison was arranged by an imperial mandate. A legend reports that Zhongli Quan and Lu Dongbin (two of the Baxian) welcomed Cao into their company after a visit to his mountain hideaway.
