Leto, Latin Latona,  in classical mythology, a Titan, the daughter of Coeus and Phoebe, and mother of the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis. The chief places of her legend were Delos and Delphi. Leto, pregnant by Zeus, sought a place of refuge to be delivered. She finally reached the barren isle of Delos, which, according to some, was a wandering rock borne about by the waves until it was fixed to the bottom of the sea for the birth of Apollo and Artemis. The wanderings of Leto were ascribed to the jealousy of Zeus’s wife, Hera, who was enraged at Leto’s bearing Zeus’s children. The foundation of Delphi followed immediately upon the birth of Apollo.
Leto has been plausibly identified with the Lycian goddess Lada; she was also known as a goddess of fertility and as Kourotrophos (Rearer of Youths).
