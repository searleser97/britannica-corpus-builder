Vǫlsunga saga, (Icelandic: “Saga of the Volsungs”)  most important of the Icelandic sagas called fornaldarsǫgur (“sagas of antiquity”). Dating from roughly 1270, it is the first of the fornaldarsǫgur to have been written down. It contains the Northern version of the story told in the Nibelungenlied. The saga was based on the heroic poems in the Poetic Edda and is especially valuable because it preserves in prose form some of the poems from the Edda that were lost. It became one of the sources of Richard Wagner’s operatic Ring tetralogy.
