Ops,  Roman goddess (originally perhaps of the Earthâ€™s fertility) with an ancient shrine in the Regia, the office of the pontifex maximus, which only he and the Vestal Virgins might enter. She was early equated with Rhea, wife of Saturn, and like her was later identified with Cybele. She also had connections with the rustic god Consus. Her title, Consiva, and the nomenclature and dating of her festivals (the Opalia on December 19 and the Opiconsiva on August 25) illustrate her affinities with the Saturnalia (December 17) and the Consualia (of Consus; December 15).
