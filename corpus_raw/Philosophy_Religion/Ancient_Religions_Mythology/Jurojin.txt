Jurōjin,   in Japanese mythology, one of the Shichi-fuku-jin (“Seven Gods of Luck”), particularly associated with longevity. He is supposed, like Fukurokuju, another of the seven with whom he is often confused, to have once lived on earth as a Chinese Taoist sage. He is often depicted as an old man with a white beard, wearing a scholar’s headdress and sometimes accompanied by a stag. He carries a large stick to which is attached a scroll containing the world’s wisdom. See also Shichi-fuku-jin.
