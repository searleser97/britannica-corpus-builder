Lu Dongbin, Wade-Giles romanization Lü Tung-pin, also called  Lu Yan or Luzi,  in Chinese religion, one of the Baxian, the Eight Immortals of Daoism, who discoursed in his Stork Peak refuge on the three categories of merit and the five grades of genies (spirits). He is depicted in art as a man of letters carrying a magic sword and a fly switch.
One of numerous legends relates that Lu rewarded an old woman for her honesty by magically transforming her well water into wine. Another well-known legend recounts Lu’s triple attempt to convert the singsong girl White Peony from her wayward life.
The turning point in Lu’s life is dramatized in Dream of the Yellow Sorghum: after meeting as a student with one of the Immortals (xian), Lu fell asleep and saw in a vision his future successful life suddenly terminated by a disaster. Lu awoke and renounced the world. He is by far the most renowned of the Eight Immortals and as Luzi (“Patriarch Lü”) is credited with founding a Daoist sect that absorbed Nestorian Christian influence. The Daoist canon contains dozens of treatises attributed to Lu, among them The Secret of the Golden Flower.
