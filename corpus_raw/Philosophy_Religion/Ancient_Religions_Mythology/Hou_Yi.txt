Hou Yi, Wade-Giles romanization Hou I,  in Chinese mythology, the Lord Archer whose prowess with a bow earned him undying fame. With his bow and arrow he saved the moon during an eclipse and rescued the country from a variety of plagues, one of which involved a wind monster who was wreaking havoc across the land. Hou Yi is also said to have shot down 9 of 10 suns (one account says 8 of 9 suns) that were burning up the earth in prehistoric times. Though tradition identifies the marksman as an officer in the armed forces of the legendary emperor Ku, he is better known among the common people as the husband of Chang’e, the goddess of the moon. After stealing the pill of immortality, Chang’e took refuge in the moon. Hou Yi followed in hot pursuit, only to be intercepted by the Hare, who would not allow Hou Yi to pass until he promised reconciliation with his wife. On the 15th day of each lunar month the spouses meet, Hou Yi traveling from his palace in the sun to the moon palace he constructed for his wife.
