Hitogami,   (Japanese: “man-god”), a way of distinguishing certain characteristics of Japanese religion by focusing on the close relationship between a deity and his transmitter, such as a seer or a shaman. The Japanese scholar Hori Ichiro contrasts hitogami as a religious system with the ujigami (“guardian deity”) type of belief. Membership in the circle of believers is not dependent on family or geographic origin (as in the ujigami system) but is based on personal faith. The two types of spiritual relationship have constantly interacted with one another in Japanese history. The hitogami type of belief is evident in the deification of heroes such as Hachiman, god of war, and Tenjin, god of calligraphy; in the ecstatic singing and dancing of Japanese festival processions; and in the charismatic leadership of some of the “new religions” of Japan.
