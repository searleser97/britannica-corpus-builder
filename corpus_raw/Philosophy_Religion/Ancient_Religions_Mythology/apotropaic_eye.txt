apotropaic eye,   a painting of an eye or eyes used as a symbol to ward off evil, appearing most commonly on Greek black-figured drinking vessels called kylikes (“eye cups”), from the 6th century bc. The exaggeratedly large eye on these cups may have been thought to prevent dangerous spirits from entering the mouth with the wine.
