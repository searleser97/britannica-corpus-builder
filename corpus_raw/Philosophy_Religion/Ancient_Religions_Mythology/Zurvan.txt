Zurvān,  in ancient Iranian religion and Zoroastrianism, the god of time.
The earliest mentions of Zurvān appear in tablets dated to about the 13th and 12th centuries bce, found at the site of the ancient Mesopotamian city of Nuzi. Known also as the god of growth, maturity, and decay, Zurvān appeared under two aspects: Limitless Time and Time of Long Dominion. The latter emerges from Infinite Time, lasts for 12,000 years, and returns to it. Zurvān was originally associated with three other deities: Vayu (wind), Thvarshtar (space), and Ātar (fire).
Zurvān was the chief Persian deity before the advent of Zoroastrianism and was associated with the axis mundi, or the centre of the world. The most common image of Zurvān depicts a winged, lion-headed deity encircled by a serpent, representing the motion of the Sun.
As a modified form of Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism reappeared in Persia during the Sāsānian period (3rd–7th century ce). Zurvanite theories equated the two Zoroastrian deities Ahura Mazdā (Avestan: “Wise Lord”) and Angra Mainyu, or Ahriman (“Evil Spirit”), a belief strongly disputed by orthodox Zoroastrians. Zurvanite thinking influenced Mithraism as well as Manichaeism and other schools of gnostic belief. Zurvanism died out a few hundred years after the advent of Islam in Iran in the 7th century.
