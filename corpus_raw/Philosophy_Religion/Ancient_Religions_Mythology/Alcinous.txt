Alcinous,   in Greek mythology, king of the Phaeacians (on the legendary island of Scheria), son of Nausithoüs, and grandson of the god Poseidon. In the Odyssey (Books VI–XIII) he entertained Odysseus, who had been cast by a storm onto the shore of the island. Scheria was identified in very early times with Corcyra, where Alcinous was revered as a hero. In the Argonautic legend, Alcinous lived on the island of Drepane, where he received Jason and Medea in their flight from Colchis.
