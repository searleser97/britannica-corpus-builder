Dian Cécht,  one of the Tuatha Dé Danann, the gods of Celtic Ireland. He was the physician of the gods and father of Cian, who in turn was the father of the most important god, Lugh (see Lugus). When Nuadu, the king of the gods, had his hand cut off in the battle of Mag Tuired, Dian Cécht fashioned him a silver hand that moved as well as a real hand. Dian Cécht’s son Miach, however, was able to give Nuadu a functional human hand; Dian Cécht killed his son in a fit of jealousy.
Dian Cécht claimed to be able to restore any man who was mortally wounded. He did this by throwing the wounded into a well and pulling them out alive. This may refer to Celtic ritual involving ritual bathing or drowning.
