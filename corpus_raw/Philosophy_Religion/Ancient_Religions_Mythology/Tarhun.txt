Tarhun, also spelled Taru, Tarhu, Tarhunt, Tarhunna, orTarhuis,  ancient Anatolian weather god. His name appears in Hittite and Assyrian records (c. 1400–612 bc) and later as an element in Hellenistic personal names, primarily from Cilicia. Tarhunt was the Luwian form and Tarhun (Tarhunna) probably the Hittite, from the common root tarh-, “to conquer.” The weather god was one of the supreme deities of the Hittite pantheon and was regarded as the embodiment of the state in action. He played a prominent part in mythology, although his name is sometimes to be read either Taru or Teshub (the Hattian and Hurrian weather gods, respectively), as the myths are either of Hattian or of Hurrian origin. He was the consort of Arinnitti, the Hittite sun goddess and principal deity.
In art Tarhun’s symbol was a three-pronged thunderbolt, which he usually carried in one hand while brandishing a club, ax, or other weapon with the other. He is rarely identified by name, and it is often uncertain whether Tarhun or the Hurrian Teshub was intended. His sacred animal was the bull, and in art this animal may stand as his symbol, or Tarhun may be depicted standing on it. Jupiter Dolichenus, the god on the bull worshiped by the Roman legions, was a development of Tarhun.
