Yima,   in ancient Iranian religion, the first man, the progenitor of the human race, and son of the sun. Yima is the subject of conflicting legends obscurely reflecting different religious currents.
According to one legend, Yima declined God’s (Ahura Mazdā’s) offer to make him the vehicle of the religion and was instead given the task of establishing man’s life on earth. He became king in a golden age in which need, death, disease, aging, and extremes of temperature were banished from the earth because of his virtue. The golden age ended, says one tale, when Ahura Mazdā told Yima of a terrible winter to come. He was instructed to build an excellent domain under the earth, lit by its own light, and take in it the best individuals from each species to preserve their seed. There they should dwell through the winter’s destruction, then emerge and repopulate the earth.
Zoroastrian tradition dislodged Yima as the first man, replacing him with the figure of Gayōmart. In later Persian literature Yima is the subject of many tales under the name Jamshīd.
