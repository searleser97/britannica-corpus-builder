Kart,  in Finno-Ugric religion, the sacrificial priest of the Mari people of the middle Volga River valley. The term kart was derived from a Tatar word meaning “elder.” The kart was either a lifetime representative of a clan or a temporary official chosen by lot to oversee common sacrificial feasts of an entire village or several villages. The kart was chosen on the basis of respect and for his knowledge of ritual, and his position afforded great honour. His functions included saying prayers, lighting ceremonial fires for sacrificial meals, choosing and determining the suitability of sacrificial animals, auguring, and blessing the offerings. In family matters he gave names to infants and officiated at weddings and funerals.
