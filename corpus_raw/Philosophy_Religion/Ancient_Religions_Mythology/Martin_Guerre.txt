Martin Guerre,  fictional character in Janet Lewis’s novel The Wife of Martin Guerre (1941), based on a 16th-century villager from Gascony who, after a decade of marriage to Bertrande de Rols, vanishes. About eight years later, Arnaud du Thil, a man resembling Guerre, arrives and is accepted by Guerre’s wife and many of the townspeople as the missing man. A claim surfaces that the real Guerre is in Flanders and a trial ensues. During the trial the real Guerre returns, and subsequently the impostor is executed.
The historical Guerre and his impostor have been the subject of many works, fictional and nonfictional. Lewis derived her version from Famous Cases of Circumstantial Evidence (1873) by Samuel M. Phillips. Lewis adapted her novel into a libretto for an opera of the same name that was first produced in 1956. A French film, Le Retour de Martin Guerre (1982; The Return of Martin Guerre) featured Gérard Depardieu as the impostor; the historian Natalie Zemon Davis, who advised the filmmakers, told the story and explored why the impostor succeeded in The Return of Martin Guerre, first published in French in 1982 and in English in 1983. Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil’s musical Martin Guerre opened in 1996.
