Thomas François Burgers,  (born April 15, 1834, near Graaff-Reinet, Cape Colony [now in South Africa]—died Dec. 9, 1881, Richmond, Transvaal [now in South Africa]), theologian and controversial president (1871–77) of the Transvaal who in 1877 allowed the British to annex the republic.
After graduating as a doctor of theology from the University of Utrecht, Burgers in 1859 returned to Cape Colony, where he became the minister of the Dutch Reformed church in Hanover. His unorthodox views, in which he questioned the literal truth of the Bible, led to his suspension by the Cape synod (1862). The decision was reversed by higher courts, and those judgments were upheld by the British Privy Council (1867).
Burgers’s eloquence and culture recommended him to influential Transvaalers seeking a successor to Pres. Marthinus W. Pretorius, who had resigned in 1871. Elected by a large majority, Burgers took office in July 1872, but his sophisticated ideas in government, education, and religion soon antagonized the Boers. To further his scheme to link the Transvaal by rail to Delagoa Bay, on the Indian Ocean, he traveled to Europe in 1875 to raise money. The now unpopular Burgers returned to engage in an inconclusive war with the Pedi chief Sekhukhune, whose lands were wanted by Boer cattle farmers and were rumoured to contain gold. In 1877 an insolvent Transvaal was annexed by a British government eager to promote federation in Southern Africa; this was supported by pro-British elements—especially the emergent gold-mining interests—within the country. After delivering a protest, a dispirited Burgers, weakened by the refusal of the Transvaal’s Volksraad (legislative body) to support emergency taxation to deal with the invasion, surrendered the republic to Sir Theophilus Shepstone and his annexing force of 25 policemen representing the British crown. Burgers then retired into obscurity.
