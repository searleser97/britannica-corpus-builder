William of Waynflete, also spelled Wainfleet,  original name William Patyn,  (born 1395?, Wainfleet-All-Saints, Lincolnshire, Eng.—died  Aug. 11, 1486, Bishop’s Waltham, Hampshire), English lord chancellor and bishop of Winchester who founded Magdalen College of the University of Oxford.
Little is known of his early years, but he evidently earned a reputation as a scholar before becoming master of Winchester College in 1429. He became a fellow at Eton in 1440 and was provost there in 1443. He was a great favourite of King Henry VI, who secured his appointment in 1447 as bishop of Winchester, a post that Waynflete retained until he died. In 1448 Waynflete founded a hall dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen at the University of Oxford, and in 1458 he was able to convert Magdalen Hall into a college. The new college took a leading part in Renaissance studies in England. Waynflete’s suppression of several monasteries in order to obtain revenues for the endowment of his college set an example for Cardinal Wolsey in the next century.
Waynflete was lord chancellor of England from 1456 to 1460. He resigned the chancellorship upon the Yorkist success in 1460, but he came to no harm in the changing fortunes of the Wars of the Roses and ended his career on good terms with Edward IV and the latter’s successor, Richard III.
