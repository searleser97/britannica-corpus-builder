Fāṭimah, also spelled Fatima, also called al-Zahrāʾ (Arabic: “the Radiant One”),  (born c. 605, Mecca, Arabia [now in Saudi Arabia]—died 632/633, Medina), daughter of Muhammad (the founder of Islam) who in later centuries became the object of deep veneration by many Muslims, especially the Shiʿah. Muhammad had other sons and daughters, but they either died young or failed to produce a long line of descendants. Fāṭimah, however, stood at the head of a genealogy that steadily enlarged through the generations and which became venerated as Ahl al-Bayt.
To the Shiʿah, she is particularly important because she was married to ʿAlī, whom the Shiʿah considered to be the legitimate heir of the authority of the Prophet Muhammad and the first of their imāms. The sons of Fāṭimah and ʿAlī, Ḥasan and Ḥusayn, are thus viewed by the Shiʿah as the rightful inheritors of the tradition of Muhammad, a further ramification of Fāṭimah’s significance among Shiʿi believers. Accordingly, many Islamic traditions give a majestic if not miraculous quality to Fāṭimah’s life.
Fāṭimah accompanied Muhammad when he emigrated from Mecca to Medina in 622 (see Hijrah). Soon after her arrival in Medina, she married ʿAlī, the Prophet’s cousin. Their first years were lived in abject poverty. When in 632 Muhammad was facing his last illness, Fāṭimah was there to nurse him. In general she was devoted to her domestic duties and avoided involvement in political affairs. Yet after Muhammad’s death she had a sharp clash with Abū Bakr, who had succeeded Muhammad as caliph and leader of the Muslim community (ummah), and Fāṭimah supported ʿAlī in his reluctance to submit to Abū Bakr’s authority. She came into conflict with the caliph a second time over property that she claimed Muhammad had left her. Abū Bakr refused to sanction her claim, and, according to most accounts, Fāṭimah refused to speak to him thereafter. She died months later from either illness or injury.
