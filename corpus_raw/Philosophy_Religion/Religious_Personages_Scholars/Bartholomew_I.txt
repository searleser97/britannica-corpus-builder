Bartholomew I, original name Dimitrios Archontonis,  (born 1940, Imbros [now Gökçeada], Turkey), 270th ecumenical patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox church from 1991.
After graduating from the patriarchal Seminary of Halki, located near Istanbul, Archontonis was ordained a priest and went on to earn a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Institute in Rome. He also studied in Switzerland and Germany. He then returned to Istanbul and joined the staff of his patriarchate, and his academic and linguistic expertise led to his consecration as bishop in 1973. He helped administer the affairs of the patriarchate of Constantinople under the ecumenical patriarch Dimitrios, and he represented the patriarchate at meetings of the World Council of Churches. Bartholomew was elected metropolitan of Chalcedon in 1990. On October 22, 1991, in Istanbul, the Holy Synod of the Eastern Orthodox church elected him archbishop of Constantinople and ecumenical patriarch, succeeding Dimitrios. Bartholomew thus became the spiritual leader—“first among equals”—of all the self-governing Eastern Orthodox churches throughout the world.
The beginning of Bartholomew’s patriarchate was characterized by tensions over what the Orthodox church considered to be Roman Catholic and Protestant encroachments into its strongholds in the former Soviet republics. In an unusual move, Bartholomew conducted a rare meeting of Orthodox leaders in Istanbul in March 1992. The patriarchs and archbishops in attendance affirmed church unity while at the same time chastising Roman Catholics and certain evangelical Protestant groups for treating traditional Orthodox countries as missionary territories.
