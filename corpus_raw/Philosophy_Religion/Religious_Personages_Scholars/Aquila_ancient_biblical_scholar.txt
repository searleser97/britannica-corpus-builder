Aquila, also called Akilas,  (flourished 2nd century ad), scholar who in about ad 140 completed a literal translation into Greek of the Old Testament; it replaced the Septuagint (q.v.) among Jews and was used by the Church Fathers Origen in the 3rd century and St. Jerome in the 4th and 5th centuries. St. Epiphanius (c. 315—403) preserved in his writings the popular Christian tradition that Aquila was a relative of the Roman emperor Hadrian, who employed him in rebuilding Jerusalem. There he was converted to Christianity, but, on being reproved for practicing pagan astrology, he returned to Judaism.
The Talmud, the rabbinic compendium of law, lore, and commentary, states that Aquila was influenced in his translation by the great martyred scholar Rabbi Akiba ben Joseph (q.v.).
Aquila’s version survives only in fragments, chiefly in extant portions of Origen’s Hexapla and in manuscripts found in the geniza (synagogue storeroom for books) at the Ezra synagogue in Cairo. Aquila’s exacting translation is important for what it reveals of the original Hebrew text of the Bible and also for what it demonstrates about the state of Hebrew learning in his time.
