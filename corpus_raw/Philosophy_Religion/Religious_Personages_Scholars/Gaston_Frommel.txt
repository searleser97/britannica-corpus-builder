Gaston Frommel,  (born November 25, 1862, Altkirch, Switzerland—died May 18, 1906, Geneva), Swiss Protestant philosopher and theologian. Frommel attempted to base theism (the doctrine teaching the existence of a personal God), religious experience, and moral conscience on objective grounds, as opposed to the a priori categories and moral imperative posited by Immanuel Kant or the psychological constructions suggested by Friedrich Schleiermacher. Among his important writings are Études de théologie moderne (1909; “Studies in Modern Theology”) and Oeuvre systématique (1910–16; abridged Eng. trans., The Psychology of Christian Faith, 1928).
