Jules Chevalier,  (born March 15, 1824, Richelieu, Fr.—died Oct. 21, 1907, Issoudun), priest, author, and founder of the Missionarii Sacratissimi Cordis Jesu (Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus), commonly called Sacred Heart Missionaries, a Roman Catholic congregation of men originally dedicated to teaching and restoring the faith in the rural sections of France and later expanded to world missions.
Educated in the French seminaries at Saint-Gauthier and at Bourges, he was ordained priest in 1851. After ministering in various towns in the archdiocese of Bourges, he became curate, in 1854 in the parish of Issoudun, where, on December 8, he founded the Sacred Heart Missionaries, serving as their first superior general until 1901. His new community was officially recognized in 1869 by Pope Pius IX, who directed the men to foreign mission work. In 1872 Chevalier became archpriest in Issoudun.
In 1881 Chevalier sent missionaries to the South Pacific islands of Micronesia and Melanesia. Then, with Marie-Louise Hartzer, he cofounded the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart at Issoudun in the following year. These nuns dedicated themselves to educational, hospital, and missionary work. Their papal approval (1928) occurred after Chevalier’s death. He is considered one of the outstanding promoters of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a cult that, though originating in the Middle Ages, is peculiar to the modern Roman Catholic Church in that it honours Christ’s heart as the symbol of his love. In 1856 Pius introduced the devotion as a feast into the church’s calendar.
Chevalier’s writings on the Sacred Heart include Notre-Dame de Sacré-Coeur de Jésus (1863) and Le Sacré-Coeur de Jésus (3rd ed., 1886).
