Alexander Kohut,  (born April 22, 1842, Felegyhaza, Hung.—died  May 25, 1894, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Hungarian-born American rabbi and scholar who wrote a monumental Talmudic lexicon and helped found the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.
In 1865 Kohut assumed his first rabbinical pulpit, the beginning of a lifelong career as a rabbi. Excelling in Hungarian language and literature, he was appointed in 1867 to be superintendent of that nation’s schools, the first Jew to hold that position. In 1872 he was elected chief rabbi of Fünfkirchen, Hung., where he remained for eight years.
In the meantime, Kohut began work on his dictionary of the Talmud, the rabbinical compendium of law, lore, and commentary. As the basis of his work, he chose to revise the classic ʿArukh (“Lexicon”), a Hebrew and Aramaic dictionary compiled by Nathan ben Yehiel, a medieval Italian Hebrew lexicographer. Kohut worked on his magnum opus for some 25 years. During this period, he emigrated to the United States (1885), where he became rabbi of a congregation in New York. In 1886, with Rabbi Sabato Morais, he helped found the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City and taught Talmudic studies there until his death. In 1892 the last volume of his ʿArukh ha-shalem was published (the first volume had appeared in 1878), and the work brought him honours from learned Jewish bodies throughout the world.
