George Augustus Selwyn,  (born April 5, 1809, Hampstead, London—died  April 11, 1878, Lichfield, Staffordshire, Eng.), first Anglican bishop of New Zealand.
Selwyn was educated at Eton and St. John’s College, Cambridge. In 1833 he was ordained a deacon and became a curate at Windsor.
He was made bishop of New Zealand in 1841. He learned to preach in Maori and to sail his own vessel among the islands that were included in his diocese. He organized the Anglican Church in New Zealand and consecrated four additional bishops there. During the Maori unrest of the 1850s and 1860s, he was suspect to Maoris as an Englishman and to settlers as a native sympathizer but later won wide respect. He became bishop of Lichfield in 1868. Selwyn College, Cambridge, was named for him.
