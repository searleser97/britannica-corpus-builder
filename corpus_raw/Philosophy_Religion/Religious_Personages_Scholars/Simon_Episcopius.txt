Simon Episcopius, also called Simon Biscop, Bischop, or Bisschop,  (born Jan. 8, 1583, Amsterdam, Dutch Republic [now in the Netherlands]—died April 4, 1643, Amsterdam), Dutch theologian and systematizer of Arminianism, a liberal reaction to the Calvinist doctrine of predestination.
He studied theology at Leiden and in 1610 became a pastor at Bleiswyk. He was made a professor at Leiden in 1612, succeeding the strict Calvinist Franciscus Gomarus. Episcopius was one of the Remonstrants, who placed more emphasis on freedom of the will than orthodox Calvinism allowed. With 12 others he was banished from the Netherlands after the Synod of Dort (1618–19) and lived in Paris, Antwerp, and Rouen until 1626. In 1634 he became head of the Remonstrant seminary in Amsterdam. In his Institutiones theologicae (1650–51), he attempted to provide a systematic basis for Remonstrant doctrine, asserting that God’s sovereignty and man’s free will are compatible.
