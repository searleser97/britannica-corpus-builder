St. Faustus of Riez,  (born c. 400, Roman Britain—died c. 490; feast day in southern France, September 28), bishop of Riez, France, who was one of the chief exponents and defenders of Semi-Pelagianism.
In the early 5th century Faustus went to southern Gaul, where he joined a newly founded monastic community on the Îles de Lérins (off the southeast coast of present France). He became the third abbot of this monastery circa 433, succeeding St. Maximus of Riez, who had been appointed bishop. Faustus was known for his piety and asceticism, and, after his election as bishop of Riez about 458, he played a leading role in the ecclesiastical life of 5th-century Gaul. His opposition to Arianism led to his eight-year exile by the Visigoth king Euric, but he returned to Riez upon the king’s death in 484.
Faustus’s De gratia gave the final form to Semi-Pelagianism. He taught that God cannot interfere with man’s freedom, either before or after his conversion to Christianity, and that all faith is rooted in grace because human freedom itself is a form of grace. His doctrine was rejected, however, by the second Council of Orange (France) in 529. His controversial orthodoxy prevents his veneration by the universal church.
