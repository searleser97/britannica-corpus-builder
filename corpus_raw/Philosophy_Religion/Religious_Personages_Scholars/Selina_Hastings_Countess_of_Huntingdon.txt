Selina Hastings, countess of Huntingdon, née Shirley,  (born Aug. 24, 1707, Staunton Harold, Leicestershire, Eng.—died  June 17, 1791, London), central figure in the evangelical revival in 18th-century England, who founded the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion, a sect of Calvinistic Methodists.
The daughter of Washington Shirley, 2nd Earl Ferrers, Selina in 1728 married Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon, whose sister inspired her conversion to Methodism. In 1739 the countess joined the Methodist society founded by John Wesley and on her husband’s death in 1746 became the “elect lady” of the new movement. Using her right as a peeress, she appointed evangelical clergymen as her chaplains and built chapels in Brighton, Bath, Tunbridge Wells, and other centres of aristocratic society. In 1768 she established Trevecca House in Talgarth, Brecknockshire, at her own expense, for the training of evangelical clergymen.
After the countess’ death her college was moved to Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, in 1792 and to Cambridge in 1904. The chapels of her Connexion, or association, survive mostly under Congregational operation.
