Jakob Frohschammer,  (born Jan. 6, 1821, Illkofen, Bavaria [Germany]—died June 14, 1893, Bad Kreuth), Roman Catholic priest, prolific writer, and philosopher who was excommunicated for claiming that philosophy and church authority are autonomous.
Ordained in 1847, Frohschammer lectured in philosophy from 1850 at the University of Munich (professor from 1855), where he began publishing his first important and controversial works, Über den Ursprung der menschlichen Seelen: Rechtfertigung des Generationismus (1854; “On the Origin of Human Souls: Justification for Generationism”) and Menschseele und Physiologie (1855; “Human Souls and Physiology”). They were placed on the church’s Index of Forbidden Books in 1857 because of their expressed views on generationism, a condemned theory stating that the human soul is created from unliving matter in the act of procreation. Though Frohschammer’s generationist views were moderate, he was early suspected by the church.
On refusing to retract, he was suspended from Munich in 1862, the year he founded Athenäum, a periodical of liberal Catholicism for which he wrote the first adequate account in German of Darwin’s theory on the origin of species by means of natural selection. Excommunicated in 1871, he replied with Der Fels Petri in Rom (1873; “The Rock of Peter in Rome”), Der Primat Petri und des Papstes (1875; “The Primacy of Peter and the Popes”), and Das Christenthum Christi und das Christenthum des Papstes (1876; “The Christianity of Christ and the Christianity of the Popes”). His principal later work is considered to be Die Phantasie als Grundprincip des Weltprocesses (1877; “Fantasy as the Basic Principle of Earthly Activities”). Frohschammer’s Philosophie des Thomas von Aquino kritisch gewürdigt (1889) criticizes St. Thomas Aquinas’ view that philosophy is the handmaid of theology.
