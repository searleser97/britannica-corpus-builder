St. Paul of Thebes, also called St. Paul the Hermit,  (born c. 230, near Thebes, Egypt—died c. 341, Theban desert; feast day January 15), ascetic who is traditionally regarded as the first Christian hermit.
According to St. Jerome, his biographer, Paul fled to the Theban desert during the persecution of Christians (249–251) under the Roman emperor Decius. Thereafter he lived a life of prayer and penitence in a cave and died at the reputed age of 113. Jerome considered Paul to be the first Christian hermit, an honour in modern times generally accorded to St. Anthony of Egypt. It is said that Anthony visited Paul when the latter was 113 years old and later buried him, wrapped in the cloak given to Anthony by St. Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria. In art Paul is often represented with a palm tree, symbolizing the source of his sustenance, or with two lions, which allegedly dug his grave.
