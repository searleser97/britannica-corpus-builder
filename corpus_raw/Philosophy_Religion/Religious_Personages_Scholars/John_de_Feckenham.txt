John de Feckenham, original name John Howman,  (born c. 1515, Feckenham, Worcestershire, Eng.—died  1584/85, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire), English priest and the last abbot of Westminster.
Feckenham was a monk at Evesham until that monastery was dissolved in 1540. He then returned for a time to Oxford, where he had formerly been educated, becoming in 1543 chaplain to Bishop Edmund Bonner of London. He shared Bonner’s disgrace for opposing Edward VI’s advancing Protestantism in 1549 and spent most of the time imprisoned until the accession of Mary. Released, he was made a chaplain to the queen and in 1554 dean of St. Paul’s. Two years later Feckenham was put in charge of restoring the Benedictine monastery at Westminster and was consecrated abbot. He was a leading opponent of the religious changes introduced by Elizabeth I after her accession in 1557; and when he and his monks refused the oath of supremacy, they were ejected and the monastery was closed (July 12, 1559). Feckenham was sent to the Tower of London in 1560 and, except for the years 1574–77, passed the remainder of his life in some kind of imprisonment.
Feckenham was an eloquent preacher, and his sermons as dean of St. Paul’s attained great popularity. He exercised a moderating influence during the Marian persecution (interceding on occasion for Lady Jane Grey and for Elizabeth), and he was one of the most prominent of the Marian churchmen who survived into Elizabeth I’s reign and refused to conform to the new religious settlement.
