Chajang Yulsa, also called Chajang,  (flourished 7th century ad, Korea), Buddhist monk who attempted to make Buddhism the Korean state religion.
Chajang entered the Buddhist priesthood in Korea and then in 636 went to T’ang-dynasty China, where he spent seven years studying and practicing Buddhist teachings. On returning home, he brought with him some supposed remains of the historical Buddha, creating a great sensation in Korea. Appointed to the highest post in the official Buddhist hierarchy of his native state of Silla, one of the three kingdoms into which Korea was then divided, he propagated the theory that Silla was the exemplary Buddhist land and that the other Korean kingdoms should humbly follow Silla’s lead. With official aid, he erected a nine-tiered tower on the compound of the Hwang-yong Temple in order to protect the Buddha remains he had brought from China. The tower was considered a sign of Silla’s national spirit. Moreover, Chajang pushed ahead with policies to further friendly relations between T’ang China and Silla and obtain Chinese aid in Silla’s wars with the rest of Korea.
At the same time, he embarked on a program to make Buddhism the official state ideology; to that end he helped to develop national morale by embarking on a program of mass enlightenment. He also built the Tongdo Temple near Pusan in order to uphold monastic austerity as the model for the nation and thus enhance the general morality and foster patriotism among the people.
