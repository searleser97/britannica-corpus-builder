Giovanni Battista Caprara,  (born May 29, 1733, Bologna, Papal States—died  June 21, 1810, Paris), Roman Catholic churchman and diplomat who negotiated between the Vatican and Napoleon Bonaparte.
After serving as papal vice legate of Ravenna and nuncio at various places (1767–92), Caprara was named cardinal-priest in 1792 and bishop of Jesi in 1800. Despite his long diplomatic career, Caprara was too timid and pliant to be an effective defender of papal interests in a period of exceptional difficulty, including negotiations with the Holy Roman emperor Joseph II. Knowing Caprara’s weaknesses, Napoleon requested that he be appointed legate in France to implement the terms of the Concordat of 1801. In 1802, Napoleon procured for Caprara the archbishopric of Milan. At his formal reception in Paris (1802), Caprara appeared to commit himself to respect the Gallican liberties (the relatively autonomous status of the French church), and he agreed to compromises unacceptable to the Vatican. He assisted in the negotiations leading to Napoleon’s coronation by Pope Pius VII in 1804 and then crowned Napoleon king of Italy in 1805.
