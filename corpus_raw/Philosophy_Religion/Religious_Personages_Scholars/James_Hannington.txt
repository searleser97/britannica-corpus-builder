James Hannington,  (born Sept. 3, 1847, Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, Eng.â€”died  Oct. 29, 1885, Equatorial Africa), English Anglican missionary and first bishop of Eastern Equatorial Africa.
Educated at St. Mary Hall, Oxford, and ordained in 1874, Hannington became curate at Hurstpierpoint in 1875. In 1878 his thoughts were turned to mission work by the murder of two missionaries on the shores of Lake Victoria. He sailed in 1882, at the head of a party of six, for Zanzibar, and thence set out for Uganda, but was forced by illness to return to England in 1883. On his recovery he was consecrated bishop of Eastern Equatorial Africa (June 1884) and in 1885 reached Lake Victoria, only to be killed with his men within a few days by order of the King of Uganda. The story of this journey is given in his own Last Journals, which were published in 1888.
