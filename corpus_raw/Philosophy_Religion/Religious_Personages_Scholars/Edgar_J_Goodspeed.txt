Edgar J. Goodspeed, in full Edgar Johnson Goodspeed,  (born 1871, Quincy, Illinois, U.S.â€”died January 13, 1962, Los Angeles, California), American biblical scholar and linguist, contributor to the Revised Standard Version of the Bible.
Goodspeed received his graduate education at Yale and the University of Chicago, the latter of which his father helped to found, then joined the faculty at Chicago, becoming professor of classical languages and the Bible and serving as chairman of the department of New Testament studies from 1929 to 1937. In 1923 he published his idiomatic version of the New Testament and in 1939, with J.M.P. Smith, produced a translation of the entire Bible. Along with eight other scholars, he laboured for 15 years on the Revised Standard Version of the Bible, published in 1946; the same year, he wrote How to Read the Bible, which became a standard guide for beginning Bible readers. Following his retirement from the University of Chicago, he continued to lecture at the University of California at Los Angeles. A prolific writer, Goodspeed produced a new book of biblical scholarship almost annually. His Introduction to the New Testament (1937), History of Early Christian Literature (1942), and A Life of Jesus (1950) were significant interpretations of the formative period of the church and its literature.
