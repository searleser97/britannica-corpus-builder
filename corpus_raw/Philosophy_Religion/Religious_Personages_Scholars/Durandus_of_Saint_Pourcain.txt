Durandus of Saint-Pourçain, French Durand de Saint-Pourçain,  (born c. 1270, Saint-Pourçain, Auvergne—died  Sept. 10, 1334, Meaux, Fr.), French bishop, theologian, and philosopher known primarily for his opposition to the ideas of St. Thomas Aquinas.
Durandus entered the Dominican order and studied at Paris, where he obtained his doctorate in 1313. Shortly afterward Pope Clement V summoned him to Avignon as a lecturer in theology. He became successively bishop of Limoux (1317), of Le Puy (1318), and of Meaux (1326). His attack on the teachings of Aquinas came at a time when Aquinas already was accepted as the official theological doctor of the Dominican order. Durandus taught that a philosopher should prefer the conclusions of his own reason to any authority except in articles of faith; the acceptance of truths of faith, on the other hand, did not depend on reason at all. This separation of reason and faith undermined the position of Scholastic philosophy generally, because much of it represented an attempt to bolster articles of faith by speculative reasoning.
In some of his differences with Aquinas, Durandus took a position similar to Nominalism (the view that only individual things exist and not universal classes such as man, tree, animal, etc.). This approach had theological implications that sometimes brought on Durandus the censure of church authorities. His major works are a commentary, published posthumously in 1508, on the Sentences of the 12th-century Italian theologian Peter Lombard and De origine potestatum et iurisdictionum (1506; “On the Origins of Powers and Jurisdictions”), written in 1328 to support Pope John XXII in his jurisdictional dispute with King Philip VI of France.
