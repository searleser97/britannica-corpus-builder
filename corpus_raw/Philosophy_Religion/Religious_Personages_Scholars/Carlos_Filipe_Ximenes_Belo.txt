Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo,  (born February 3, 1948, Wailacama, East Timor), Roman Catholic bishop of Dili who, with José Ramos-Horta, received the 1996 Nobel Prize for Peace for their efforts to bring peace to East Timor (Timor Timur) during the period that it was under Indonesian control (1975–99).
Belo was ordained a bishop in 1983. As spiritual leader of a territory that is overwhelmingly Catholic, he became one of the primary spokesmen of the Timorese people. In 1989 he was named apostolic administrator of Dili. He denounced the brutal tactics and oppressive policies of the Indonesian government despite at least two attempts on his life, in 1989 and 1991. Following a massacre of peaceful demonstrators in Dili in 1991, Belo successfully campaigned for reforms in the military and the dismissal of two generals. A strong believer in nonviolent resistance, Belo sought peaceful means to settle the troubles in his homeland. In an open letter written in July 1994, he outlined his concern for the people of East Timor and proposed that the Indonesian government reduce its military presence, expand the civil rights of citizens, and allow East Timor to conduct a democratic referendum on self-determination. The referendum, held in 1999, paved the way for East Timor’s independence in 2002.
Citing poor health, Belo resigned as apostolic administrator of Dili in November 2002. He later rejected calls to run for president of East Timor. In 2004 he began serving as a missionary in Mozambique.
