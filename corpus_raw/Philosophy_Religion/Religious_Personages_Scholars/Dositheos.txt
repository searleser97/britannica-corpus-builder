Dosítheos, Latin Dositheus,  (born May 31, 1641, Aráchova, Greece—died  Feb. 8, 1707, Constantinople), patriarch of Jerusalem, an important church politician and theologian of the Greek church who staunchly supported Eastern orthodoxy over Roman Catholicism. Ordained deacon in 1652, he became archdeacon of Jerusalem in 1661. He subsequently was made archbishop of Caesarea Palestinae (now Ḥorbat Qesari, Israel) in 1666 and patriarch of Jerusalem in 1669.
Through correspondence and extensive journeys Dosítheos became involved in the state of the Eastern church in the Balkans, Georgia, and Ukraine. To prevent Protestantism from influencing the Greek church, in 1672 he convoked the Synod of Jerusalem, which is considered to be the most important Orthodox Eastern church council in modern times. The synod supported Dosítheos by condemning the doctrines, which Patriarch Cyril Lucaris of Constantinople had set forth in his Confession of Faith (1629). Rejecting unconditional predestination and justification by faith alone, Dosítheos’ synod was the culmination of a controversy started by Cyril’s plan to reform the Orthodox church on Calvinistic lines.
His relations with the Russian tsar Peter I the Great (to whom he wrote many letters) were strained because of Peter’s church reforms, particularly the abolition of the patriarchate of Moscow and subjection of the Orthodox Church of Russia to the state. Dosítheos failed to make Peter intercede for the Eastern churches in the peace treaty with Turkey in 1702.
Dosítheos’ extensive writings are largely compilations from the Greek Fathers. They were directed against the Roman Catholic church and the Eastern Catholics—i.e., those Eastern churches that joined with Rome. His History of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, 12 volumes, was posthumously published in 1715.
