Claude-Jean Allouez,  (born June 6, 1622, Saint-Didier, Fr.—died August 27/28, 1689, near Ft. St. Joseph, New France), Jesuit missionary to New France who has been called the founder of Catholicism in the West.
Allouez entered the Society of Jesus at Toulouse, was ordained priest in 1655, and sailed for Quebec in 1658. He was stationed at settlements along the St. Lawrence River until his appointment (1663) as vicar general of the Northwest. He travelled extensively through that territory, preaching to the Indians and establishing missions—chiefly in present-day Wisconsin, including Chequamegon Bay and Green Bay. His own accounts of his activities are frequently quoted in The Jesuit Relations, edited by R.G. Thwaites. Allouez was a predecessor and later a colleague of Jacques Marquette, for whom he wrote a book of prayers. His last years were spent mostly among the Miamis of the St. Joseph River in modern southwestern Michigan.
