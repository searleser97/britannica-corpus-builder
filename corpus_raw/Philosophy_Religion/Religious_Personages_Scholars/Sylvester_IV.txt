Sylvester (IV) , also spelled Silvester, original name Maginulfo,  (born, Rome—died  1111), antipope from 1105 to 1111. While the Investiture Controversy raged between the German king Henry V (later Holy Roman emperor) and Pope Paschal II, the imperialist faction, under Werner, margrave of Ancona, elected Maginulfo as successor to the imperialist antipope Albert (Aleric) on Nov. 18, 1105. He was the fourth in a line of antipopes set up against Paschal II.
Taking the name Sylvester, he was expelled from Rome the next day by Paschal’s troops. While his adherents continued to oppose Paschal, Sylvester received some recognition from Henry, but when the King and the Pope came to terms in 1111, Sylvester’s pretensions were dismissed. He was never widely supported.
