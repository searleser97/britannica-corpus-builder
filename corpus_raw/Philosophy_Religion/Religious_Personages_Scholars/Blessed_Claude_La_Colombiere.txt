St. Claude La Colombière,  (born February 2, 1641, Saint-Symphorien-d’Ozon, France—died  February 15, 1682, Paray-le-Monial; beatified June 16, 1929; canonized May 31, 1992; feast day February 15), French Jesuit priest who assisted St. Margaret Mary Alacoque in establishing the devotion to the Sacred Heart. He was her confessor, and his writings and testimony helped to validate her mystical visions and elevated the Sacred Heart as an important feature of Roman Catholic devotion.
Educated by the Jesuits of Lyon, he entered their novitiate at Avignon in 1658 and subsequently studied theology at the Collège de Clermont, Paris. After ordination he was appointed to the chair of rhetoric in the Collège de la Trinité at Lyon (1670–73). In 1675 he became superior of the Jesuit college at Paray-le-Monial, where he spiritually directed Margaret Mary. In 1676 he was appointed court preacher to Mary of Modena, who had become duchess of York by marriage with the future King James II of England, and he took up his residence in St. James’s Palace, London. Falsely accused by a former protégé of complicity in Titus Oates’s “popish plot,” he was imprisoned for five weeks and, when released, was obliged to return to France, where he died an invalid under the care of Margaret Mary. He was beatified by Pope Pius XI on June 16, 1929, and was canonized as a saint by Pope John Paul II in 1992.
