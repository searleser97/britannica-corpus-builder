Rām Dās, also called Bhāī Jeṭhā,  (born 1534, Lahore, Punjab, India—died  1581, Goindwal), fourth Sikh Gurū and founder of the great Sikh centre of Amritsar, now headquarters or capital of the religion.
Rām Dās continued as Gurū (1574–81) the missionary endeavour begun by his predecessor, Amar Dās. On land given to him by the Mughal emperor Akbar, he built a holy tank, or pool; then, wishing to build a community around it, he invited businessmen and traders to settle there. The town was first named Rāmdāspur and then Amritsar. Following the tradition of his saintly forerunners, Rām Dās urged Emperor Akbar to punish graft among his officials and to endow charitable undertakings of all kinds. He was noted for his humility, piety, and service to others. Shortly before the death of Rām Dās, his son Arjun succeeded him as Gurū.
