Saint Dionysius,  (born, Greece?—died  Dec. 26, 268, Rome; feast day December 6), pope from 259/260, to Dec. 26, 268.
While a presbyter during the pontificate of Pope Stephen I (254–257), he took part in the controversy on rebaptism of converts and received an appeal from Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, to avoid a break between Rome and the Asian churches.
Dionysius, a vigorous reformer who succeeded Sixtus II as pope, faced the urgent task of reorganizing the church. Sixtus had been martyred in the persecution of Christians under the emperor Valerian. The see of Rome had been vacant for almost a year. One of Dionysius’ first acts was to send funds to the Christians in Cappadocia (in modern Turkey) suffering from a Persian invasion (259).
In response to charges of tritheism—i.e., separating the members of the Trinity as three distinct deities—against Bishop Dionysius of Alexandria, the pope convened a Roman synod (260) and demanded an explanation from Bishop Dionysius; this became known as “the affair of the two Dionysii.” Semantics was at the root of the difficulty; Greek and Roman understandings of the same terms differed. The discussions at the synod helped to prepare the way for the theology of the Nicene Creed (325). The bishop cleared himself in his Refutation and Apology and accepted the pope’s authority. Thus the Roman Church’s claim to governing in matters of faith was strengthened by Dionysius’ pontificate, one of the most important of the 3rd century.
