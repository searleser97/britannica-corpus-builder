Gerardus van der Leeuw,  (born March 18, 1890, The Hague—died  Nov. 18, 1950, Utrecht, Neth.), Dutch Reformed theologian and historian of religions, who contributed significantly to the phenomenological (descriptive) analysis of religious experience.
Leeuw proposed that a nonrational (mystical) tradition underlies the evolution of religious manifestations. He affirmed a specific nature for religion, making it irreducible to psychological or anthropological interpretation, and held that mystical and logical modes of thought coexist in man. His writings include Phänomenologie der Religion (1933; Religion in Essence and Manifestation: A Study in Phenomenology, 1938) and Vom Heiligen in der Kunst (1957; Sacred and Profane Beauty; the Holy in Art, 1963).
