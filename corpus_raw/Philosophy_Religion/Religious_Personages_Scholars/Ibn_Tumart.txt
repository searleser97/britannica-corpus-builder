Ibn Tūmart, in full Abū ʿabd Allāh Muḥammad Ibn Tūmart,  (born c. 1080, Anti-Atlas Mountains, Mor.—died  August 1130), Berber spiritual and military leader who founded the al-Muwaḥḥidūn confederation in North Africa (see Almohads). The doctrine he taught combined a strict conception of the unity of God with a program of juridical and puritanical moral reform, based on a study of the Qurʾān and of tradition.
