Alfred George Edwards,  (born Nov. 2, 1848, Llanymawddwy, Merionethshire, Wales—died  July 22, 1937, St. Asaph, Flintshire, Wales), the first archbishop of Wales, who sought successfully to create a native church more reflective of Welsh culture than was the Anglican Church.
Edwards graduated from Jesus College, Oxford, in 1874. After a successful headmastership of Llandovery College, he became vicar of Carmarthen in 1885, where he began the great work of his life, the defense and strengthening of the Welsh national church. An ardent believer in disestablishment, he fought his church’s many enemies on every ground of fact and principle by sermons, politics, and publications, of which the most important were The Truth About the Church in Wales (1889) and Landmarks in the History of the Welsh Church (1912). In 1889 he was appointed bishop of St. Asaph, and from the disestablishment in 1920 until his retirement in 1934 he was archbishop of the Church of Wales.
