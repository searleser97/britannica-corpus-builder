Vajrabodhi,  Indian Buddhist monk who helped transmit Buddhism to China. Vajrabodhi and his disciple Amoghavajra arrived in China in 720, where they produced two abridged translations of the Sarvatathagatatattvasamgraha (“Symposium of Truth of All the Buddhas”), also known as the Tattvasamgraha. This work and the Mahāvairocana Sūtra became the two basic Chen-yen texts.
