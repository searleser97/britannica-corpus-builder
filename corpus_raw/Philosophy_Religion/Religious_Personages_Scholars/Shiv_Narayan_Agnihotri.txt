Shiv Narayan Agnihotri,  (born 1850, near Kanpur, India—died 1929, Lahore [now in Pakistan]), Hindu founder of a quasi-religious reform movement called Dev Samaj (“Divine Society”).
At the age of 16 Agnihotri entered the government-sponsored Thompson Engineering College in Roorkee, and in 1873 he took a position as a drawing master in the Government School of Lahore. He and his wife became active members of the Brahmo Samaj (literally, “Brahma Society,” also translated as “Society of God”), a Hindu reform movement founded in Bengal. In 1882 Agnihotri resigned his teaching position to work full-time for the Brahmo Samaj. Eventually, he resigned from the Brahmo Samaj to form a new society, the Dev Samaj, which he ruled as guru. The Dev Samaj was at first a theistic society, but later it reemerged as a movement dedicated to social reform, insisting on strict ethical conduct by its members and advocating the social integration of castes and the education of women, among other ideals. Although it denied the existence of traditional gods, it emphasized the semidivinity of Agnihotri himself, asserting that he had attained the highest possible plane of existence and that eternal bliss could not be attained without his guidance.
