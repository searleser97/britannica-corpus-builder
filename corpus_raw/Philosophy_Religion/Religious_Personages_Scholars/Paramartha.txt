Paramārtha,  (born 499—died 569), , Indian Buddhist missionary and translator whose arrival in China in 546 was important in the development of Chinese Buddhism. The basic teachings of the consciousness-oriented Yogācāra school of thought became known in China primarily through the work of Paramārtha; working out of Chien-k’ang in southern China, he is credited with the translation of more than 60 Buddhist texts, most prominently the Mahāyānasaṃgraha, the Viṃśatikā, and the Madhyāntavibhāga-śāstra. These translations facilitated the development of the Fa-hsiang school.
