Stigand,  (died Feb. 21/22, 1072), archbishop of Canterbury, probably the English king Canute’s priest of this name whom he placed over the minster of Ashingdon in Essex in 1020.
Stigand was consecrated bishop of Elmham in 1043 but was deposed later in the year when Queen Emma, mother of Edward the Confessor, fell into disgrace, because he was her adviser. He was reinstated in 1044. In 1047 he became bishop of Winchester, and Elmham was given to his brother Aethelmaer. Stigand mediated the peace between King Edward and Earl Godwine in 1052 and was made archbishop of Canterbury in place of the Norman Robert of Jumièges, who had fled. He did not, however, relinquish Winchester. As he had been intruded into Canterbury while his predecessor was alive, his position was regarded as uncanonical; hence, he did not receive the pallium until 1058, and then only from the antipope Benedict X, after whose deposition (1059) Stigand was excommunicated by Pope Nicholas II. His continuance as archbishop was one of the reasons for the papal support given to William I the Conqueror’s invasion in 1066; he probably crowned Harold II as king. Yet he was too powerful for William to remove him at once, and he was not deposed until 1070. Domesday Book shows him to have had extensive lands and many men commended to him.
