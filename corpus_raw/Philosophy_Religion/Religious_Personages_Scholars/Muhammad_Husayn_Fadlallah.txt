Muḥammad Ḥusayn Faḍlallāh, in full Ayatollah Sayyid Muḥammad Ḥusayn Faḍlallāh,  (born November 16, 1935, Al-Najaf, Iraq—died July 4, 2010, Beirut, Lebanon), Iraqi-born Lebanese Muslim cleric who was a prominent Shīʿite religious leader and was thought to have been a cofounder (1957) of the Shīʿite Islamic Daʿwah Party in Iraq.
Faḍlallāh was schooled at a traditional madrasah in his birthplace, where he studied under many of the eminent Shīʿite scholars of his day. His scholarly acumen eventually earned him the honorific title of ayatollah. He moved to Lebanon (where his parents were born) in 1966 and quickly established a reputation as a leading religious authority. He was also admired for his extensive charitable work and for his relatively progressive ideas on women’s rights. Although some believed that Faḍlallāh was the leader of the Shīʿite militia and political party Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, both he and the party denied any direct link. Though impressed by the Islamic revolution in Iran (1978–79), he generally stood aloof from the more radical position of its leader, Ruhollah Khomeini. Faḍlallāh was openly critical of the United States and Israel, and he survived multiple assassination attempts, notably a car bomb attack in 1985 and an Israeli bomb attack on his home in 2006.
