Fulk, Archbishop of Reims, French Foulques, or Foulque, Archevêque De Reims,  (died June 17, 900), leader of the opposition to the non-Carolingian king Eudes (of the West Franks, or France).
Failing to establish his kinsman, Guy II of Spoleto, as king of the West Franks in 888, Fulk turned unavailingly to Arnulf, king of the East Franks, and then to the young Charles, son of the Carolingian Louis II the Stammerer; he crowned Charles at Reims in 893. His view was that only one of Carolingian blood could rightfully become king. Although Charles had to yield to Eudes, he became king (as Charles III) on the latter’s death in 898, and Fulk became his chancellor. Fulk’s efforts to keep church property out of the hands of the nobles provoked his assassination in 900 at the instigation of Count Baldwin II of Flanders.
