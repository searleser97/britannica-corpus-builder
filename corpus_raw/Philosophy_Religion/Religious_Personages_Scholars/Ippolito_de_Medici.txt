Ippolito de’ Medici,  (born 1509, Urbino, Duchy of Urbino—died  August 10, 1535, Itri, Papal States), Italian cardinal and one of the pawns in the civil strife of Florence in the 1520s and 1530s.
Only seven years of age on the death of his natural father, Giuliano de’ Medici, duc de Nemours, Ippolito was cared for by his uncle Pope Leo X, who, however, died just five years later. In 1524 Pope Clement VII (also a Medici) sent him to Florence to be installed as a member of the government and destined, when of age, to rule Florence as his father had—meanwhile, living under the regency of Silvio, Cardinal Passerini. In 1527 a republican uprising drove out Passerini and the Medici, and Clement VII and the Holy Roman emperor Charles V, heretofore at odds, had to come to terms to restore order on the Italian peninsula.
By the end of 1529, Clement VII was scheming to supplant Ippolito with the more ruthless Alessandro de’ Medici as ruler of Florence and, to this effect, entered into a secret treaty with Charles V at Bologna (December 1529). Charles had already sent an army against Florence, which capitulated after a siege of 11 months (August 1530), and Alessandro was installed as head of state for Florence in October 1530 (becoming duke of Florence in May 1532). Ippolito, meanwhile, had been compelled to become a cardinal and was kept out of the way on missions to Hungary and elsewhere.
Alessandro’s tyrannical rule proved so unpopular that a group of Florentine exiles selected Ippolito as their ambassador to petition Charles V for Alessandro’s removal. While waiting at Itri for a boat to Tunis, where Charles was on an expedition, Ippolito was poisoned, presumably at the instigation of Alessandro. His assassin, Giovanni Andrea, escaped to Florence and the protection of Alessandro’s palace but later, on a visit to his hometown of Borgo San Sepolcro, was seized by the populace and stoned to death.
