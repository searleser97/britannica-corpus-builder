Philip Embury,   (born 1728, probably in Ballingrane, County Limerick, Ire.â€”died  August 1775, Camden, N.Y., U.S.), Irish-American preacher and one of the founders of Methodism in the United States.
Converted after a religious experience on Christmas Day, 1752, Embury was soon recognized as a potential leader and was licensed as a local preacher. He emigrated to America in 1760 and settled in New York City, where in 1766 he began to preach. His first sermon was delivered to a company of five persons, whom he organized into a class in his own home. This gathering constituted the first Methodist society in New York City. After two years his audience had grown sufficiently to justify the building of Wesley Chapel (the first John Street Church), and in October of 1768 Embury preached the dedicatory sermon. In 1770 he moved to Ash Grove, near Camden, Washington county, N.Y. There he organized the first Methodist society north of New York City and continued until his death to preach and to act as the civil magistrate.
