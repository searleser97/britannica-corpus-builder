Asher ben Jehiel, also called (by acronym) Rosh (for Rabbenu [“Our Teacher”] Asher),  (born c. 1250, Rhine District [Germany]—died  Oct. 24, 1327, Toledo, Spain), major codifier of the Talmud, the rabbinical compendium of law, lore, and commentary. His work was a source for the great codes of his son Jacob ben Asher (1269–1340) and of Joseph Karo (1488–1575).
When the German authorities began to persecute the Jews, Asher fled to France and then to Spain. With the help of Rabbi Solomon ben Adret, one of the most influential rabbis of his time, he was established as rabbi of Toledo, where he founded a yeshiva (school of advanced Jewish learning). Asher believed that the study of philosophy might endanger the Talmud’s authority. Hence he, Rabbi ben Adret, and others signed a ban forbidding such study to those under 30. On Rabbi ben Adret’s death, Asher was acknowledged as the leader of European Jewry.
His code, the Piske Halakhot (“Decisions on the Laws”; compiled between 1307 and 1314), based largely on the Palestinian Talmud (as distinct from the Babylonian Talmud), deals strictly with the Talmudic laws. Asher considered the Talmud a supreme authority and felt free to disregard the opinions of the most eminent Jewish authorities if their decisions were not based on the Talmud. His code has been reprinted with the Talmud continuously since its first issuance with the Bomberg Talmud in 1520 (a famous edition of the Talmud by the Flemish printer Daniel Bomberg).
