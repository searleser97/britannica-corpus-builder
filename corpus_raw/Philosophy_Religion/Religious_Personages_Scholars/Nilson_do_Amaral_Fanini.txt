Nilson do Amaral Fanini,  (born March 18, 1932, Curitiba, Paraná state, Braz.—died Sept. 18, 2009, Dallas, Texas, U.S.), Brazilian Baptist religious leader and evangelist.
Fanini earned a degree in theology from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, and a law degree from the Fluminense Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. He also studied at the prestigious Superior War College in Rio.
Fanini was a long-serving pastor (1964–2005) of the First Baptist Church of Niterói, Brazil—one of the largest evangelical churches in South America—which claimed 7,000 members in the first decade of the 21st century. Under his leadership the church launched 28 new churches and sponsored 92 missions. In 1994 it rescued and committed to care for some 3,500 babies from Brazilian slums. Fanini preached weekly on 52 radio and 110 television stations that reached 40 million people in Brazil and six other South American countries. He preached in 87 countries worldwide and was the first evangelist to be allowed to preach in Angola and Mozambique.
He also served as president of Reencontro (Portuguese: “Reunion”), an evangelical benevolent society that distributed Bibles worldwide and operated 19 free clinics, an orphanage, a vocational training program, a food-distribution centre, and child-care agencies. While leading Reencontro, Fanini sponsored the Bible Society of Brazil, which provided 25 million Bibles to that country alone. Between 1995 and 2000 Fanini was president of the Baptist World Alliance (BWA), an international advisory organization representing more than 40 million Baptists.
