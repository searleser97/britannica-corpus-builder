St. Miltiades, also spelled Melchiades,  (born, Africa?â€”died  January 10, 314, Rome [Italy]; feast day December 10), pope from 311 to 314.
Miltiades became the first pope after the edicts of toleration by the Roman emperors Galerius (ending the persecution of Christians), Maxentius (restoring church property to Miltiades), and Constantine the Great (favouring Christianity). He also received a palace (the Lateran) from Constantine that served as the papal residence. Concurrently, however, dissension within the church was caused by the Donatists, North African schismatics who contested the election of Caecilian as bishop of Carthage. At the Lateran Council of 313, Miltiades supported Caecilian and condemned the Donatists, who refused to submit. Constantine then ordered the Council of Arles (Arelate), the first representative meeting of Christian bishops in the Western Roman Empire, but Miltiades died before the council convened. Miltiades is considered a martyr because of earlier sufferings under the Roman emperor Maximian.
