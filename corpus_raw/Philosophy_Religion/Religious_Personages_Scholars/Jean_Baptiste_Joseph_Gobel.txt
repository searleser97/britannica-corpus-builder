Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gobel,  (born Sept. 1, 1727, Thann, Alsace, Fr.—died  April 14/26, 1794, Paris), archbishop of Paris whose resignation doomed him to association with the Hébertists, followers of the extremist journalist Jacques-René Hébert, who, during the French Revolution, pursued an anti-Christian policy in a program of “worship of Reason.”
Educated at the German College, Rome, Gobel became in 1755 vicar-general of the diocese of Basel, Switz. In 1789 he was a deputy to the Estates General, meeting outside Paris. On Jan. 3, 1791, he took the oath of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and was consecrated archbishop of Paris, but on Nov. 7, 1793, he resigned his episcopal functions, for he had accepted the principles of the Revolution, including marriage of the clergy. The Hébertists then claimed Gobel as one of themselves, an identity for which he was condemned to the guillotine with the anti-Roman Catholic revolutionary Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette and with Hébert and Anacharsis Cloots, one of the founders of the cult of Reason.
