Lazarus, Hebrew Eleazar,  (“God Has Helped”), either of two figures mentioned in the New Testament.
The miraculous story of Lazarus being brought back to life by Jesus is known from the Gospel According to John (11:1–45). Lazarus of Bethany was the brother of Martha and Mary and lived at Bethany, near Jerusalem. The account notes that Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters and that when Lazarus died of illness, Jesus wept and was “greatly disturbed.” Although Lazarus had been entombed for four days by the time Jesus arrived at Bethany, he was raised by Jesus from the dead and emerged from the tomb wearing his burial cloths. This miracle, witnessed by many Jews who had come to grieve with the family, inspired many to believe in Jesus as the Christ. Lazarus was also present when his sister Mary anointed the feet of Jesus with expensive perfume (John 12:1–3).
Lazarus is also the name given by the Gospel According to Luke (16:19–31) to the beggar in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. It is the only proper name attached to a character in the parables of Jesus.
