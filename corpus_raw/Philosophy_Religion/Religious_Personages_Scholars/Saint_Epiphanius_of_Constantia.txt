Saint Epiphanius of Constantia,  (born c. 315, near Eleutheropolis, Palestine—died  May 403, at sea; feast day May 12), bishop noted in the history of the early Christian church for his struggle against beliefs he considered heretical. His chief target was the teachings of Origen, a major theologian in the Eastern church whom he considered more a Greek philosopher than a Christian. Epiphanius’ own principles were discredited by the harsh nature of his attacks.
Epiphanius studied and practiced monasticism in Egypt and then returned to his native Palestine, where near Eleutheropolis he founded a monastery and became its superior. In 367 he was made bishop of Constantia (Salamis) in Cyprus. He spent the rest of his life in that post, spreading monasticism and campaigning against heretics. His orthodox views conflicted with those of the Roman emperor Valens, who governed in the East from 364 to 378 and who had embraced Arianism, but Epiphanius was protected by the veneration in which he was held for his sanctity.
In 403 Epiphanius went to Constantinople to campaign against the bishop there, St. John Chrysostom, who had been accused of sheltering four monks expelled from Alexandria for their Origenistic views. Becoming convinced of the falsity of this and related charges made by Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria (who wanted to depose John), Epiphanius set sail for Cyprus but died en route.
A zealous bishop and a revered ascetic, Epiphanius was lacking in moderation and judgment. These defects are reflected in his writings, of which the chief work is the Panarion (374–377), an account of 80 heresies and their refutations, which ends with a statement of orthodox doctrine. His Ancoratus (374) is a compendium of the teachings of the church. His works are valuable as a source for the history of theological ideas.
