Al-Hamadānī, in full ʿAlī ibn Shihāb ad-Dīn ibn Muḥammad al-Hamadānī,  (born Oct. 22, 1314, Hamadān, Iran—died  Jan. 18, 1385, near Kunar, Kashmir, India), mystic Persian theologian responsible for the propagation of the Kubrāwīyah order of Sufis (Islamic mystics) in Kashmir.
A scion of a famous Persian family of Sayyids (descendants of the Prophet Muhammad), he became a dervish (itinerant holy man) and traveled extensively throughout the Middle East. He visited Kashmir in 1372, 1378, and 1385. Through his efforts and those of his followers, the Kubrāwīyah order of mystics became popular in Kashmir. Al-Hamadānī’s best-known work is his Dhakhīrat al-mulūk (“Treatise on the State”)—a study of political ethics. His burial place, Kulab, is still a pilgrimage site.
