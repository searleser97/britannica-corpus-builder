Saint Paulinus of Nola, byname of Meropius Pontius Anicius Paulinus,  (born ad 353, Burdigala, Gaul [now Bordeaux, France]—died  June 22, 431, Nola, Italy; feast day June 22), bishop of Nola and one of the most important Christian Latin poets of his time.
Paulinus became successively a Roman senator, consul, and governor of Campania, a region of southern Italy. Returning to Aquitaine he married and in 389 retired with his wife to Spain. The death of their only child, in 392, influenced them to sell their possessions in Gaul and Spain. In 395 Paulinus was ordained priest and with his wife settled at Nola to live an ascetic life devoted to charity.
Paulinus’ act of renunciation caused his old master, the Latin poet and rhetorician Ausonius, to write reproaches in verse, to which Paulinus replied in poetical epistles. Paulinus’ style generally echoes that of such classical authors as Virgil, Horace, and Ovid. His poems (395–407) on the feast day of St. Felix of Nola are particularly charming and are regarded as the chief source of Felix’ life. Paulinus also promoted the saint’s cult and built a basilica at Nola dedicated to him.
Some 50 of his extant letters correspond with famous contemporaries, including Saints Augustine and Jerome and the celebrated ascetic Sulpicius Severus. Paulinus’ prose style is often rhetorical and exuberant: he could describe in dignified language his cold reception by Pope St. Siricius, or satirize the ignorance of those who could not understand the life of renunciation. About 409 Paulinus was consecrated bishop of Nola.
