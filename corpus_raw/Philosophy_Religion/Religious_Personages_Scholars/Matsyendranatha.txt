Matsyendranatha, also called Minanatha,  (flourished 10th century?, India), first guru (spiritual teacher) of the Nathas, a popular Indian religious movement combining elements of Shaivism, Buddhism, and Hatha Yoga, a form of yoga that stresses breath control and physical postures.
Matsyendranatha’s name appears on both the lists of the nine nathas (“masters”) and the 84 mahasiddhas (“great accomplished ones”) common to Hinduism and Buddhism. He was given semidivine status by his followers: he was identified with the god Shiva by his Hindu followers and Avalokiteshvara-Padmapani (a bodhisattva, or buddha-to-be) by his Buddhist followers in Nepal. In Tibet he was known as Lui-pa. The names Matsyendranatha (“Lord of the King of Fish”) and Minanatha (“Lord of Fish”) refer, according to one legend, to his receipt while in the form of a fish of spiritual instruction from Shiva  and, in another legend, to his rescue of a sacred text from the belly of a fish.
The historical details of Matsyendranatha’s life are lost in the legends that have grown up around him. Though an ascetic, he succumbed, according to one legend, to the enchantments of two queens of Sri Lanka and had two sons, Parasnath and Nimnath, who became leaders of Jainism. His leading disciple, Gorakhnath, is commonly regarded as the founder of the Kanphata Yogis, an order of religious ascetics who stress the practice of Hatha Yoga.
