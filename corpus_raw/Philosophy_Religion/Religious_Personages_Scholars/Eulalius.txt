Eulalius,  (died 423), antipope from December 418 to April 419. He was an archdeacon set up against Pope St. Boniface I by a clerical faction. The rivalry that ensued led to the first interference of the temporal authorities in papal elections. Both the Pope and the Antipope were asked by Emperor Honorius to leave Rome pending a council’s decision, but Eulalius (the imperial favourite) imprudently returned to perform the Holy Week services at the Lateran. For this defiance of the Emperor’s orders he was rejected, and Boniface was declared the legitimate pope. When Boniface died, some thought Eulalius would seek to regain the Holy See, but ill health prevented this, and he died in obscurity in Campania.
