Henry Wheeler Robinson,  (born Feb. 7, 1872, Northampton, Northamptonshire, Eng.—died  May 12, 1945, Oxford), notable Nonconformist English Baptist theologian and Old Testament scholar.
Robinson studied at Regent’s Park College, London, the University of Edinburgh, Mansfield College, Oxford, and Marburg and Strasbourg universities (1890–1900), and then became Baptist minister at Pitlochry, Perthshire (1900–03), and St. Michael’s, Coventry (1903–06), before being appointed tutor at Rawdon Baptist College near Leeds. He became president of the Yorkshire Baptist Association in 1918. He wrote the valuable textbook The Religious Ideas of the Old Testament (1913). From 1920 to 1942 he was principal of Regent’s Park College, where his teaching and administrative gifts had full scope. It was largely through his efforts that the college was transferred from London to Oxford.
Robinson’s most important academic work was in Hebrew psychology (notably in his exposition of the concept of “corporate personality”) and Old Testament theology. His Speaker’s Lectures (Oxford), posthumously published as Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament (1946), are the prolegomena to a full-scale Old Testament theology which he did not live to write. The Christian Doctrine of Man (1911), The Christian Experience of the Holy Spirit (1928), and Redemption and Revelation (1942) reflect his wider theological interests.
