James Chalmers,  (born August 4, 1841, Ardrishaig, Argyll, Scotland—died  April 9, 1901, Dopima, Goaribari Island), Scottish Congregationalist missionary who explored the southwest Pacific, where he became known as “the Livingstone of New Guinea.”
Ordained in 1865, Chalmers was sent by the London Missionary Society to Rarotonga in 1866. Having facilitated the establishment of British rule in northern New Guinea (1888), Chalmers strove to form an indigenous church free of westernized culture but was killed and eaten by cannibals on an island off the south coast of Papua. In his Pioneering in New Guinea (1887), he presented new geographic details.
