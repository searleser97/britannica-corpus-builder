Saint Eusebius,  (born, Greeceâ€”died  309/310, Sicily; feast day August 17, formerly September 26), pope from April 18 to Aug. 17, 309/310. His epitaph, written by Pope Damasus I, tells of a violent dispute in Rome about readmitting apostates after the persecution of Christians under the Roman emperor Diocletian. Eusebius was opposed by a faction that wanted offenders readmitted to the church without penance. The Roman emperor Maxentius exiled both Eusebius and his opponent. Eusebius was sent to Sicily, where he died almost immediately. His body was taken to Rome and interred in the catacomb of Calixtus. Eusebius is venerated as a martyr.
