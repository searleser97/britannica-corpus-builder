Joseph Albo,  (born c. 1380, Monreal?, Aragon [Spain]—died c. 1444), Jewish philosopher and theologian of Spain who is noted for his classic work of Jewish dogmatics, Sefer ha-ʿiqqarim (1485; “Book of Principles”).
Little is known of Albo’s life. He is known to have participated in the Disputation of Tortosa (1413–14), a definitive confrontation between Spanish Jews and Christians, in which he distinguished himself by his ability to explain Jewish scriptures. The Sefer ha-ʿiqqarim, completed in Castile about 1425 (although not published for some 60 years), was probably intended as a work of Jewish apologetics, i.e., a defense of Judaism against criticism of it by other religious groups—in this case, Christians. In this work Albo sought to enumerate those fundamental dogmas or articles of faith of Judaism that are essentially derived from the divine law and can thus be eternally valid for other religions as well. Sefer Ha-ikkarim (1929–30), edited and translated by Isaac Husik, was the first translation into English.
