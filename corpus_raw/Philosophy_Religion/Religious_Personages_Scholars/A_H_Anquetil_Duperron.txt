A.-H. Anquetil-Duperron, in full Abraham-Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron,  (born Dec. 7, 1731, Paris, France—died Jan. 17, 1805, Paris), scholar and linguist who was generally credited with supplying the first translation of the Avesta (Zoroastrian scripture) into a modern European language and with awakening interest in the study of Eastern languages and thought.
At the University of Paris, Anquetil mastered Hebrew as his first Eastern language; later, he added Persian and Arabic to his linguistic stock. At the Royal Library in Paris he found some ancient works in Avestan, an Iranian language of the time of the 6th-century-bc religious prophet Zoroaster. The largest remaining group of Zoroastrians, the Parsis, had fled to India to escape Muslim persecution. In search of the ancient Zoroastrian texts, Anquetil traveled to India, where he acquired and translated nearly 200 such manuscripts. He also wrote numerous papers and treatises on Oriental languages, laws, and systems of government.
In 1771 his Zend-Avesta appeared. Despite its many discrepancies and inaccuracies, it remains a pioneer work. Among his other works are Législation orientale (1778), Historical and Geographical Research on India (1786), and The Dignity of Commerce and the Commercial State (1789). His India in Rapport with Europe appeared in 1798, and his last major work was Upanishada (1804; “Secrets Never To Be Revealed”).
