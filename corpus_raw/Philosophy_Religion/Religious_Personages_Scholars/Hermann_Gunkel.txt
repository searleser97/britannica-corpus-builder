Hermann Gunkel,  (born May 23, 1862, Springe, Hannover [Ger.]—died  March 11, 1932, Halle), German Old Testament scholar who was one of the first to develop the method of biblical criticism known as form criticism.
Educated at the University of Göttingen, Gunkel taught there and at Halle, Berlin, and Giessen. A leading member of the History of Religions school, he stressed the literary values of the Old Testament by comparative study of the legends on which it draws, particularly in Genesis, Psalms and the Prophets, on which he published works in 1901, 1903, and 1917. Extending his researches beyond current dogmatic interpretations, he promoted the study on literary-historical lines of the religious history of Israel, publishing Die israelitische Literatur (1906; “The Literature of Israel”) and Die Urgeschichte und die Patriarchen (1911; “Earliest History and the Patriarchs”). He contributed Psalmen to the Göttinger Handkommentar zum Alten Testament (1910; “Göttingen Ready Reference Commentary on the Old Testament”), assisted in the first edition of the religious encyclopaedia Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart (1903–13; “Religion in History and the Present”), and was coeditor of the second edition (1927–32). Together with Wilhelm Bousset he founded the series Forschungen zur Religion und Literatur des Alten Testaments und des Neuen Testaments (1903– ; “Research into the Religion and Literature of the Old and New Testaments”).
