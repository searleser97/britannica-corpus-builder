Saint Vincent of Lérins, pseudonym Peregrinus,  (born, possibly Toul, Belgica [now in France]—died c. 450; feast day May 24), Gallo-Roman saint, the chief theologian of the Abbey of Lérins, known especially for his heresiography Commonitoria (“Memoranda”).
Supposedly the brother of Lupus of Troyes, Vincent may possibly have been a soldier before joining, before about 425, the Abbey of Lérins, on the Mediterranean island of Lérins, near Cannes, Fr. Vincent was later ordained priest and spent his monastic life at Lérins, where he acquired a preeminent reputation in scriptural learning and dogma.
About four years after the Council of Ephesus (431), Vincent, under the pseudonym of Peregrinus (“Pilgrim”), wrote Commonitoria, which attempted to reply to current heresies. It is unclear whether the work once consisted of two books, the second of which was lost and replaced by a résumé made by Vincent, or whether it is complete in its present form.
For the Semi-Pelagians of whom Vincent was a leading spokesman, St. Augustine of Hippo was a dangerous innovator teaching contrary to tradition. The Commonitoria is now generally admitted to be an indirect attack on Augustine, who is not named but to whom the work alludes. In the Commonitoria Vincent tries to provide a valid criterion for orthodoxy and, in doing so, enunciates the classic formula for traditional doctrine: “What is believed everywhere, at all times, and by all.” Most of Vincent’s other works are lost.
Vincent’s surviving works are in J.-P. Migne’s Patrologia Latina, vol. 50. Critical editions of the Commonitoria include those of R.S. Moxon (1915) and A. Jülicher (1925). R. Morris’ English translation, Vincent of Lérins, the Commonitories, is in The Fathers of the Church, vol. 7 (1949).
