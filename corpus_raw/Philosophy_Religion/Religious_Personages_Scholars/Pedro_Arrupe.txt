Pedro Arrupe,  (born November 14, 1907, Bilbao, Spain—died February 5, 1991, Rome, Italy), 28th superior general (1965–83) of the Society of Jesus. Known for his spiritual depth and commitment to justice, Arrupe helped guide the order through the changes of the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) and refocused the Jesuits with a “preferential option for the poor.”
Arrupe studied medicine at the University of Madrid, but, after witnessing the poverty in that city, he left school to join the Jesuits in 1927. When the Spanish government dissolved the Jesuit order in Spain in 1932, Arrupe continued his religious studies elsewhere in Europe and in the United States, where he was ordained at St. Mary’s Seminary in Kansas in 1936. In 1938 he went to Japan, where he took his final vows as a Jesuit in 1943 and spent a total of 27 years as a missionary. In 1945 he headed one of the first rescue parties to go into Hiroshima after that city was devastated by an atomic bomb. He and the other Jesuits converted their novitiate into a makeshift hospital, and Arrupe used his medical skills to treat about 200 dying and injured people there. He was deeply affected by the horror of the experience. He subsequently became Jesuit vice provincial (1954–58) and then the first Jesuit provincial for Japan (1958–65).
Arrupe was elected superior general of the Jesuits in 1965. He led the Society of Jesus during an upsurge of liberalism among some of its members, who supported such ideas as a married priesthood and liberation theology, which prioritizes social and political work among the poor in developing countries. In the 1970s these activities brought the Jesuits into conflict with Pope John Paul II, who regarded the moderately liberal Arrupe as being overly permissive in his administration of the order. Arrupe resigned in 1983 because of ill health following a stroke; he was the first Jesuit superior general to resign instead of remaining in office until his death.
