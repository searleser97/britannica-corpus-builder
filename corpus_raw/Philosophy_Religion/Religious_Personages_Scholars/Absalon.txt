Absalon,  (born c. 1128, Fjenneslev, Den.—died  March 21, 1201, Sorö), archbishop, statesman, and close adviser of the Danish kings Valdemar I and Canute VI.
Scion of a powerful Zealand family, Absalon helped his childhood friend gain the Danish throne as Valdemar I (1156–57) and was named bishop of Roskilde in 1158. As the king’s closest adviser, he initially supported Valdemar’s alliance with Frederick I Barbarossa, Holy Roman emperor, against Pope Alexander III. By 1167 Absalon and Valdemar had become reconciled with the pope.
Absalon helped end the Wend (Slav) threat to Danish shipping by leading a campaign in 1169 that captured the Wend stronghold of Rügen. The incorporation of Rügen into Absalon’s diocese of Roskilde initiated a period of Danish supremacy in northern Germany that lasted until 1225. At that time he also directed the building of a fortress at Havn, which later developed into Copenhagen. He was a key advocate of the canonization of Valdemar’s father, Canute Lavard, and of the coronation of Valdemar’s son Canute VI as joint king (1170), which established the hereditary rights of the Valdemar dynasty.
Elected archbishop of Lund in 1177, Absalon was the guardian of Canute VI and guided him to a position of independence from Frederick I after Canute became sole ruler in 1182. The expedition that Absalon headed to the southern Baltic coast in 1184 led to Danish control of Pomerania and Mecklenburg. He later returned to his church duties.
