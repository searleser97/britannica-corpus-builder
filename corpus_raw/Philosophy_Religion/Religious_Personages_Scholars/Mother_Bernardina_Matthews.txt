Mother Bernardina Matthews, in full Bernardina Teresa Xavier of St. Joseph, original name Ann Teresa Matthews, Matthews also spelled Mathews,  (born 1732, Charles county, Md. [U.S.]—died June 12, 1800, Port Tobacco, Md., U.S.),  American religious leader, the founder of the first monastery of a Roman Catholic order in the United States.
Matthews grew up in a deeply religious home in a time when Roman Catholics laboured under legal disabilities and other discriminations in Maryland. In 1754 she traveled to Hoogstraeten, Belgium, to enter an English contemplative order of Discalced Carmelites. She took the habit as Sister Bernardina in September 1754 and made her profession in November 1755. She later became mistress of novices in the monastery, and in 1774 she was elected prioress.
Mother Bernardina had long considered the idea of establishing the order in America when, in rapid succession, the American Revolution swept away the legal disabilities of Catholics there and Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, dissolved the monasteries in the Netherlands in 1782. The complex task of raising money and securing permissions took until 1790. In April of that year Mother Bernardina sailed with four companions, and in July they settled at Chandler’s Hope on the Port Tobacco River in Charles county, Maryland. The monastery established there was the first of any religious order in the United States. (The Ursuline convent in New Orleans, Louisiana, dating from 1727, was in what was still French territory.) Three months later the monastery was moved a short distance upriver. Novices were attracted from the surrounding region, and by 1800 the monastery housed 14 nuns. Mother Bernardina served as prioress until her death.
