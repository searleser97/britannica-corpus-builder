Jacques Ellul,  (born Jan. 6, 1912, Bordeaux, France—died  May 19, 1994, Bordeaux), French political and social scientist, Protestant theologian, and philosopher of technology, best known for his antitechnological views, as expressed in his masterwork La Technique: ou, L’enjeu du siècle (1954; The Technological Society).
Ellul attended the universities of Bordeaux and Paris. He lectured at the universities of Montpellier (1937–38) and Strasbourg (1938–40) before joining the Resistance during World War II. From 1944 to 1947 he was deputy mayor of Bordeaux. He was a professor of the history of law (1946–80) at the University of Bordeaux and professor of social history (1947–80) at the affiliated Institute of Political Studies.
Ellul’s early works include Le Fondement théologique du droit (1946; The Theological Foundation of Law) and Présence au monde moderne (1948; The Presence of the Kingdom). The books for which he is best known, however, are La Technique, Propagandes (1962; Propaganda; The Formation of Men’s Attitudes), and L’Illusion politique (1964; The Political Illusion), all of which warn the reader of the dangers of human loss of control over the state, technology, and the modern world. Apart from these works, Ellul’s canon is chiefly theological in nature and Christian in perspective.
