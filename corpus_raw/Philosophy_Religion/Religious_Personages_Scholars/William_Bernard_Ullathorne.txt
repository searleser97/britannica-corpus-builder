William Bernard Ullathorne,  (born May 7, 1806, Pocklington, Yorkshire, Eng.—died  March 21, 1889, Oscott, Warwickshire), Roman Catholic missionary to Australia and first bishop of Birmingham, Eng. He was influential in securing the final abolition (1857) of the British system of transporting convicts to Australia.
Ullathorne was a descendant of Sir Thomas More. He served as a cabin boy before joining the Benedictines at Downside Abbey, near Bath, in 1823 and was ordained in 1831. He volunteered to serve the convicts in Australia, where he was sent the following year as vicar general. He was the first chaplain to visit the penal colony on Norfolk Island in the southern Pacific Ocean, between New Caledonia and northern New Zealand. While working with the convicts (1832–42), he made visits to Rome and England. In 1836 his Horrors of Transportation Briefly Unfolded was published, and in 1838 he gave evidence before the Parliamentary Commission on Transportation, which influenced the abolition of the transportation system.
Ullathorne left Australia to work in Coventry, Eng., where he remained until his appointments as vicar apostolic of England’s western district (1846) and of the central district (1848) and subsequently as first bishop of Birmingham (1850). Ullathorne cofounded the Dominican convent at Stone, Staffordshire, in 1853. When he resigned from his diocese in 1888, he was made titular archbishop of Cabasa, Egypt. Ullathorne’s autobiography, From Cabin-Boy to Archbishop, was edited in 1941 by S. Leslie.
