Theodoric,  (died 1102, near Cava deâ€™ Tirreni, near Salerno, Duchy of Apulia), antipope from 1100 to 1101. As cardinal bishop of Santa Ruffina, he was elected pope by the faction headed by the Holy Roman emperor Henry IV during the struggle between empire and papacy. In 1101, however, he was seized by the supporters of the legitimate pope, Paschal II, who had him confined to the Holy Trinity monastery, near Salerno, where he died.
