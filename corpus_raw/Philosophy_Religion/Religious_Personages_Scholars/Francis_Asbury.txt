Francis Asbury,  (born Aug. 20, 1745, Hamstead Bridge, Staffordshire, Eng.—died  March 31, 1816, Spotsylvania, Va., U.S.), first bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church consecrated in the United States. His efforts did much to assure the continuance of the church in the New World.
After limited schooling Asbury was licensed as a local preacher, and at the age of 21 he was admitted to the Wesleyan Conference. For four years he served as an itinerant preacher in England. In August 1771 he volunteered for service in North America.
Landing at Philadelphia the following October, he preached wherever he got a hearing, and he was soon made John Wesley’s general assistant. To enforce Wesley’s rules for his preachers and societies, Asbury required every preacher to travel a circuit. He favoured American independence and remained in the country when every other active preacher appointed by Wesley had departed for Britain. In 1778 he became a citizen of Delaware. At the organizing conference for the Methodist Episcopal Church (Baltimore, December 1784) Asbury refused to accept an appointment from Wesley as general superintendent of the church, insisting that the office be filled by a vote of the preachers. He was then elected by his peers, consecrated as superintendent, and in 1785 assumed the title of bishop.
Asbury crossed the Alleghenies 60 times and traveled an average of 5,000 miles (8,000 km) a year on horseback. The early growth of the church was largely the result of his strenuous efforts; when he arrived in America there were only three Methodist meetinghouses and about 300 communicants. By the time of his death there were 412 Methodist societies with a membership of 214,235. His Journal and Letters were published in three volumes (1958).
