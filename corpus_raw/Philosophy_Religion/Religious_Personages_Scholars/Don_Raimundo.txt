Don Raimundo, English Don Raymond,  (born, France—died  1152, Toledo, Castile [Spain]), archbishop and leading prelate of the 12th-century Spanish Christian church, whose patronage of the Toledan school of translators contributed greatly to medieval learning.
Raimundo was one of the many French Cluniac monks who, under the leadership of Bernard of Périgord (archbishop of Toledo, 1086–1124), went to the Iberian Peninsula to reform the Spanish church during the era of King Alfonso VI of Leon (from 1065) and of Castile (from 1072). His vision and generalship at last established Christian hegemony in the peninsula.
In 1109 Raimundo was appointed bishop of Osma but was dispossessed and imprisoned in 1111 by Alfonso VI’s successor, Alfonso I of Aragon, for opposing his marriage with Alfonso VI’s daughter Urraca. This persecution commended him to King Alfonso VII of Leon and Castile, whose chancellor he became. On Bernard’s death, Raimundo was appointed to succeed him as archbishop of Toledo and primate of Spain.
It was probably as a result of Raimundo’s encouragement that the Toledan school of translators developed. Some effort to make available to Christians the learning of the Spanish Arabs had already begun, but Raimundo encouraged Spanish scholars to translate many important Arabic and Jewish works, unknown to Christians, into Latin. Soon foreign scholars arrived in Toledo to commission translators or to investigate the material at hand. Raimundo’s personal patronage was especially reserved for philosophical translations, notably Neoplatonic works and the highly influential Fons vitae (“Fountain of Life”) of the Jewish poet and philosopher Ibn Gabirol. The Toledan translators, subsequently associated with a great cathedral school, produced works for three centuries; and under Raimundo’s reign there began the flourishing of Christian-Arabian-Jewish culture in Spain.
