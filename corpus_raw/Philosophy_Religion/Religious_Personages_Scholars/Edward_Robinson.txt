Edward Robinson,  (born April 10, 1794, Southington, Conn., U.S.—died  Jan. 27, 1863, New York, N.Y.), American biblical scholar, considered the father of biblical geography.
Robinson graduated from Hamilton College in 1816, taught mathematics and Greek there, was instructor in Hebrew at Andover Theological Seminary, and in 1826 went to Europe to study in the major German universities, returning in 1830. In 1837 he became professor of biblical literature at Union Theological Seminary, New York City, and left the United States to explore in Palestine and Syria. His Biblical Researches in Palestine, Mount Sinai, and Arabia Petraea (1841), published simultaneously in England, Germany, and the United States, immediately established his reputation. Later Biblical Researches in Palestine and the Adjacent Regions appeared in 1856. Robinson’s plans to sum up his important topographical studies in a work on biblical geography were cut short by illness in 1862. Physical Geography of the Holy Land, including his last work as far as he had been able to carry it, was published in 1865. All of Robinson’s works were based on careful personal exploration and tempered by a thoroughly critical spirit, possibly at times too skeptical of local tradition. He also wrote Harmony of the Four Gospels in Greek (1845) and Harmony of the Four Gospels in English (1846), both important in their day.
