Daochuo, Wade-Giles romanization Tao-ch’o,  (born 562—died 645), Chinese Buddhist monk and advocate of the Pure Land doctrine. His predecessor Tanluan had preached that invocation of the name Amitabha (the celestial Buddha of Infinite Light) would allow even evil persons to gain access to the Western Paradise (Sukhavati). Daochuo argued that in this degenerate age people must take the “easy path” to salvation of complete trust in Amitabha, for they no longer possessed the capacity to follow the more difficult path of the saints.
