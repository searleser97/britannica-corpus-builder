Constantine Manasses,  (born c. 1130—died c. 1187), Byzantine chronicler, metropolitan (archbishop) of Naupactus, and the author of a verse chronicle (Synopsis historike; “Historical Synopsis”).
Written at the request of Emperor Manuel I’s sister-in-law, Irene, the chronicle surveys a period from the Creation to 1081. It is in the so-called political (i.e., 15-syllable) metre and was widely read. His romance on Aristander and Calithea, also in “political” verse, survives in fragments only. He wrote a variety of other poems, as well as descriptive pieces in prose (some on works of art), and a number of orations, including an address to Manuel I and a funeral eulogy of Nicephorus Comnenus.
