Saint Gotthard, also spelled Godehard,  (born c. 960, near Niederaltaich, Bavaria [Germany]—died  May 4, 1038, Hildesheim; canonized 1131; feast day May 4), abbot and archbishop, who helped foster the development of Hildesheim and who played an important role in the imperial campaign to reform and reorganize the Bavarian church.
Gotthard was educated in the monastery school of Niederaltaich and at the court of Archbishop Frederick of Salzburg, Austria, one of his chief patrons. Frederick made him provost of the canons at Niederaltaich, where, already ordained priest, Gotthard became a Benedictine monk (990), provost, and abbot (996/997). His work so impressed the Holy Roman emperor Henry II that he appointed Gotthard to reform many monasteries, including Hersfeld and Tegernsee (now in Germany) and Kremsmünster (now in Austria).
In 1022 Henry nominated Gotthard as successor to the great prelate Bernward, bishop of Hildesheim. Gotthard’s episcopate was a zealous one: he restored the cathedral, consecrated more than 30 churches, promoted and reformed education, tightened asceticism, founded schools, and established a hospice for the sick and the poor at nearby Sankt Moritz. In 1132 his relics were transferred from the cathedral to a Benedictine monastery in Hildesheim founded in his honour by the celebrated abbot St. Bernard of Clairvaux.
Several German churches have designated him their patron. His extant letters and a contemporary life by his disciple Wolfher are printed in Monumenta Germaniae Historica (ed. by G.H. Pertz).
