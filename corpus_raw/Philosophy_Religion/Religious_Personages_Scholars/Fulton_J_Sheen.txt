Fulton J. Sheen, in full Fulton John Sheen, also called Bishop Fulton Sheen or Venerable Fulton J. Sheen,  (born May 8, 1895, El Paso, Illinois, U.S.—died December 9, 1979, New York), American religious leader, evangelist, writer, Roman Catholic priest, and radio and television personality.
Sheen was the oldest of four children born to Newt Sheen, a farmer, and his wife Delia. As a child, he served as an altar boy at the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Peoria, Illinois. Sheen attended parochial school and then attended St. Viator College, in Bourbonnais, Illinois, where he earned a B.A. in 1917 and an M.A. in 1919. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest later that year. Sheen pursued further studies, earning a bachelor’s degree in canon law from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., in 1920; a Ph.D. in philosophy from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium in 1923; and a Doctor of Sacred Theology from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome in 1924. After a further year of study in Belgium, he served as a priest in London for one year before moving to Peoria, Illinois, in 1926 to serve as a parish priest. Later that year he left Peoria to join the philosophy faculty at the Catholic University of America, where he taught until 1950.
Sheen was not only a respected teacher but also a gifted orator. The rising popularity of radio in the early 20th century provided Sheen with an opportunity to gain a wide audience. In 1930 he began his 22-year radio career on the program The Catholic Hour, which reached an estimated four million listeners at the height of its popularity. In 1951 Sheen became a titular bishop, and he served as auxiliary bishop of New York (1951–66). During much of his tenure in New York, he hosted a weekly television series, Life Is Worth Living (1951–57), that attracted about 30 million viewers. On that show the bishop, often speaking without a script and appearing at his characteristic chalkboard, discussed practical matters of faith and sharply criticized communism.
Sheen was appointed national director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith in 1958, a position he held until 1966, when he was appointed bishop of Rochester, New York. From 1961 to 1969 he hosted another popular television show, The Bishop Fulton Sheen Show. He also wrote various books and a syndicated newspaper column. In 1969 he was appointed archbishop of Newport, Wales. From 1976 until his death three years later, Sheen served Pope Paul VI as Assistant to the Pontifical Throne, a position that authorized him to stand by the papal throne during official ceremonies. He died shortly after open-heart surgery in 1979 at the age of 84. Among his many books are Communism and the Conscience of the West (1948), Way to Inner Peace (1955), and The Power of Love (1965).
Sheen was venerated, or officially recognized for having lived a life of holy virtue (a major step toward canonization as a saint of the church), by Benedict XVI in 2012. In July 2019 Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to Sheen, making possible his future beatification.
