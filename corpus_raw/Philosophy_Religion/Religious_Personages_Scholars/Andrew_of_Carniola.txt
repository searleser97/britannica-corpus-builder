Andrew Of Carniola, also called Andrew Of Kraina,  (died Nov. 13, 1484, Basel, Switz.), archbishop, advocate of conciliar rule in the Western church—i.e., the supremacy of a general council of bishops over the papacy. Because of his personal animosity and eccentric conduct toward Pope Sixtus IV, church historians generally do not consider Andrew a precursor of reform.
From the scant data available on Andrew’s life, it appears that he was of Slavic origin and a member of the quasi-monastic Dominicans at the order’s convent in Udine (Italy). Supported by the Holy Roman emperor Frederick III, he was named archbishop of Carniola in January 1476, while continuing to live elsewhere. He arrived in Rome about 1478 to represent Emperor Frederick at the court of Pope Sixtus IV. After an unsuccessful attempt to be named a cardinal of the church, he denounced the pope and was imprisoned. Freed by Frederick’s intervention, Andrew traveled to Florence and Milan, seeking support from Sixtus’ foes. Arriving at Basel, he announced a general council, principally to depose Sixtus, and nailed a formal indictment of the pope to the doors of the cathedral. This action apparently was an appeal to reconvene the Council of Basel (1431–37), which had vainly attempted to subject the pope to its authority by decreeing that the assembly of bishops governed directly by divine right.
Lacking the support of the bishops, Andrew met with antipapal agents from Florence and Milan to devise strategy. In September 1482 Pope Sixtus placed Basel under interdict (prohibiting the clergy to exercise any sacramental ministry) for extending protection to Andrew. Papal ambassadors then obtained from Frederick a decree placing Andrew in the custody of Basel’s governing council, but he later was consigned to papal authorities. Condemned to life imprisonment in Basel, Andrew is said to have hanged himself in his cell.
