Denis-Auguste Affre,   (born Sept. 28, 1793, Saint-Rome-de-Tarn, France—died  June 27, 1848, Paris), prelate, archbishop of Paris, and opponent of King Louis-Philippe, remembered for his brave attempt to end the June 1848 riots, in which he was accidentally slain.
Affre was ordained a priest in 1818 and became a Sulpician and a teacher of theology in 1819. He successively became vicar-general of the French dioceses of Luçon (1821), Amiens (1823), and Paris (1834) and in 1840 was named archbishop of Paris.
By 1827 Affre had become well known for his clerical reforms. His differences with Louis-Philippe began in 1843, and a long polemical debate over secondary education ensued in which Affre particularly defended academic freedom. He welcomed the establishment of the Second Republic in 1848 and the overthrow of Louis-Philippe on February 24 of that year. On the following June 23 the Parisian workers rose in an insurrection known as the June Days, which ended in bloodshed that grieved Affre. Led to believe that his personal intervention might restore order, he entered the barricades in the workers’ Saint-Antoine district on June 25. He had scarcely begun to speak when confused firing broke out. Struck by a stray bullet, he died two days later.
Among Affre’s several canonical and philosophical works are Essai historique et critique sur la suprématie temporelle du pape (1829; “Historical Essay on the Temporal Supremacy of the Pope”) and Introduction philosophique à l’étude du Christianisme (1845; “Philosophical Introduction to the Study of Christianity”). He also edited the periodical La France chrétienne, which he helped found.
