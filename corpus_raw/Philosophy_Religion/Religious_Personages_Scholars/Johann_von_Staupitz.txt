Johann von Staupitz,  (born 1468/69, Motterwitz, near Leisnig, Wettin Lands [Germany]—died  Dec. 28, 1524, Salzburg, Austria), vicar-general of the German Augustinians during the revolt against the Roman Catholic church led by Martin Luther, of whom, for a time, he was teacher, patron, and counselor.
From 1483 to 1489 Staupitz studied at the universities of Cologne and Leipzig, becoming an Augustinian. A doctor of theology (1500), he helped found the University of Wittenberg, where he became the theological faculty’s first dean in 1502. The following year he was chosen vicar-general of the Augustinians.
At Wittenberg from 1508, Staupitz began his highly influential relationship with Luther, whom he spiritually directed. His attempt to revive stricter discipline and to unite two branches of the Augustinians in Germany led to revolt, and Luther was one of two monks chosen to present at Rome the appeal of some of the order’s dissident houses. The appeal failed, and Luther returned to become Staupitz’ loyal supporter, particularly of his campaign against indulgences. He encouraged Luther to take a doctorate and become a teacher, and Luther succeeded him in the chair of biblical theology at Wittenberg.
As Luther’s theological difficulties became acute and led to his break with the Roman Catholic church, Staupitz gradually withdrew his support from his protégé. In 1520 he resigned as vicar-general, becoming, at Salzburg in 1522, a Benedictine and subsequently abbot of St. Peter’s Abbey. In the end Staupitz no longer sympathized with Luther’s doctrine, which he finally condemned as heresy.
