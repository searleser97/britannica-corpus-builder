Nicholas Of Lyra, Latin Nicolaus Lyranus,  (born c. 1270, Vieille-Lyre, Normandy—died  Oct. 16/23, 1349, Paris), author of the first printed commentary on the Bible and one of the foremost Franciscan theologians and influential exegetes (biblical interpreters) of the Middle Ages. 
Becoming a Franciscan c. 1300, by 1309 Nicholas was a professor at the Sorbonne, where he taught for many years. From 1319 he headed the Franciscans in France and in 1325 founded the College of Burgundy, Paris. Nicholas’ chief work is his monumental 50-volume Postillae perpetuae in universam S. Scripturam (“Commentary Notes to the Universal Holy Scripture”), a commentary on the whole Bible that became a leading manual of exegesis. The importance of the Postillae lies in its emphasis on a literal, rather than a mystical or an allegorical, interpretation of Scriptures. Some scholars claim that the work had an important influence on Martin Luther.
