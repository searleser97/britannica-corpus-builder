Jonathan Dickinson,  (born April 22, 1688, Hatfield, Massachusetts, U.S.—died October 7, 1747, Elizabethtown, New Jersey), prominent Presbyterian clergyman of the American colonial period and the first president of Princeton University.
Joining the newly founded Presbyterian body in the Middle Colonies in 1717, he soon became a leader in theological thought and debate. When in 1721–29 its synod deliberated over adoption of a constitution, it was largely through Dickinson’s efforts that the undefined powers were given to the presbyteries rather than to the synod, or central body. When the two factions, known as the Old Side and the New Side, differed over the extent to which ministers must accept creedal statements, he proposed a compromise that proved unacceptable, and controversy ensued. The church was further plagued by differences of opinion on the Great Awakening revival of the 1730s and ’40s; Dickinson, after some hesitation, gave his support to the group that approved the new movement. In 1746 the New Side founded the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University), and Dickinson served as its first president for the brief period before his death.
