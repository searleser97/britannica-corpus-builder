Guillaume Durand, also called William Durandus, or Duranti,  (born c. 1230, Puymisson, Fr.—died  Nov. 1, 1296, Rome), French prelate who was a renowned canonist and medieval liturgist.
After receiving a doctorate in canon law at Bologna, Italy, Durand taught briefly there and later at Modena, Italy. Some time after 1260 he was appointed auditor (a judge commissioned to hear cases of appeal brought to the Holy See). At the second Council of Lyon (1274), he helped draft the statutes proclaimed in council by Pope Gregory X. In 1278, when Bologna and the Romagna were incorporated into the Papal States, Durand was one of the first group of commissioners sent there; subsequently he held various posts in the ecclesiastical and temporal administrations of the new province, becoming its governor general in 1283. He was consecrated (1286) bishop of Mende, in southern France, but did not take possession of his see until 1291.
Durand’s fame as a writer rests chiefly on his Speculum iudiciale (first published 1271–76, revised and reissued c. 1289–91), an encyclopaedic treatise of canon law (and, to some extent, civil law) from the viewpoint of court procedure. The book remains valuable for its information on the judicial practice of the medieval church courts, especially of the Roman curia. Of his liturgical works, the Rationale divinorum officiorum (c. 1285–91), a general treatise on the liturgy and its symbolism, is considered one of the most important medieval books on divine worship. The Speculum was printed at least 39 times between 1473 and 1678, and the Rationale even more.
