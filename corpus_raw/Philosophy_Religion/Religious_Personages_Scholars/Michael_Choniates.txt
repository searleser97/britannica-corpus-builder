Michael Choniates, erroneously called Michael Acominatus,  (born c. 1140, Chonae, Byzantine Empire [now in Turkey]—died c. 1220, Boudonitza, Byzantine Empire [near modern Thermopylai, Greece]), Byzantine humanist scholar and archbishop of Athens whose extensive Classical literary works provide the principal documentary witness to the political turbulence of 13th-century Greece after its occupation by the Western Crusaders.
Having studied at Constantinople (Istanbul) under the Classicist Eustathius of Thessalonica, Michael Choniates became metropolitan (senior archbishop) of Athens about 1175 and laboured for almost 30 years to reverse the material and moral deterioration of that tax-laden city. Amassing a collection of original and copied manuscripts, he advanced Classical learning by his own scholarship. At the fall of Athens to the Franks under Boniface of Montferrat in 1204, he refused to submit to the papacy and fled to the island of Ceos, where he lived until 1217, when he retired to the monastery of Prodromos in Boudonitza.
Michael Choniates’ writings comprise a variety of forms, including doctrinal conferences, eulogies, poetry, and letters. In iambic verse he mourned the intellectual destitution of 13th-century Athenian society and, by various rhetorical pieces, castigated the avarice and tyranny characterizing the local landlords and Byzantine bureaucracy. He also wrote laudatory odes to his brother Nicetas and to Emperor Isaac II Angelus (reigned 1185–95).
