St. Alexis, Russian Aleksey or Aleksei,  (born c. 1295, Moscow, Russia—died  1378, Moscow; canonized 1448; feast day October 5), metropolitan of Moscow from 1354 to 1378 and the first representative of the Russian Orthodox Church to take a truly active role in governing Russia.
Alexis became regent during the short reign of Ivan the Fair (1353–59), great-great-grandson of Prince Alexander Nevsky, the greatest leader of medieval Russia. Alexis followed the two political principles of Nevsky: first, to defer to the powerful Tatars (a branch of the Mongols) who had conquered Russia in the 13th century and who were to dominate Russian affairs for nearly 200 years; and, second, to resist the encroachments, military and political, of the Western powers, particularly the Lithuanians, who sought to subjugate Russia.
Alexis wielded the power of his office with cunning political precision. He curried the favour of the Tatars by curing the sick wife of the khan. He excommunicated the princes of Tver and Smolensk because they were conspiring with the Lithuanians. Above all, Alexis strove for political consolidation of the fragmented Russian provincial outposts, and he succeeded. A mere three years after his death, the united Russian Army defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Kulikovo Pole (September 8, 1380), signaling the end of Tatar domination.
