George Carey, in full George Leonard Carey, Baron Carey of Clifton,  (born November 13, 1935, London, England), archbishop of Canterbury from 1991 to 2002, theologian noted for his evangelical beliefs.
Carey left school at age 15 and served as a radio operator in the Royal Air Force from 1954 to 1956. By 20 he had undergone a religious conversion—not Paul’s experience on the road to Damascus, he admitted, but the simple conviction that he had found something special. He was then admitted to King’s College, London University, from which he received a bachelor of divinity degree in 1962. Beginning his clerical career as a curate in Islington (1962–66), Carey was also a lecturer at Oakhill College in Southgate (1966–70) and at St. John’s College in Nottingham (1970–75). He was vicar of St. Nicholas Church in Durham (1975–82) and principal of Trinity College, Bristol (1982–87). In 1987 Carey was made bishop of Bath and Wells, and in 1990 he was named to succeed as archbishop of Canterbury.
As archbishop, Carey faced several controversial issues. Most notably, he supported the ordination of women in the church and declared that those opposed to it were heretics. The church also wrestled with the ordination and marriage of homosexuals, which Carey opposed. He spoke in support of the war in Afghanistan following the terrorist attacks on the United States in September 2001, but he also called for a dialogue between Christians and Muslims. He announced his retirement in 2002, and Rowan Williams, archbishop of Wales, was appointed as his successor. That year Carey was created a life peer as Baron Carey of Clifton. He also became an honorary assistant bishop in the Oxford diocese, but he resigned that post in 2017 after an independent review criticized his handling of sex-abuse allegations involving a bishop several decades earlier.
He wrote a number of books, including I Believe in Man (1975), God Incarnate (1976), The Gate of Glory (1986), The Message of the Bible (1988), and The Archbishop of Canterbury’s Millennium Message (2000).
