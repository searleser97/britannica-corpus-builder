Thomas Woolston,  (born 1670, Northampton, Northamptonshire, Eng.—died Jan. 27, 1733, London), English religious writer and Deist.
Woolston became a fellow at the University of Cambridge in 1691. After studying the work of Origen, a 3rd-century theologian of Alexandria who in his allegorical interpretation of Scripture stressed the spiritual qualities of creation over the material, Woolston also began to interpret Scripture allegorically rather than literally. He soon came into conflict with the government, and, when it was reported that his mind had become defective, he was deprived of his fellowship, and in 1721 went to live in London. He formally entered into the Deist controversy with his book The Moderator Between an Infidel and an Apostate (1725). In addition to questioning prophecies and the Resurrection of Christ, Woolston insisted on an allegorical interpretation of biblical miracles. He applied his principles in particular in A Discourse on Our Saviour’s Miraculous Power of Healing (1730), which reportedly sold 30,000 copies. Woolston thus played a pivotal role in the denial of the miracles in the Gospel. In 1729 Woolston was arrested and tried for publishing the series, sentenced to a year’s imprisonment, and ordered to pay a fine, with imprisonment until the fine was paid. Unable to raise funds to pay the penalty, he died in confinement.
