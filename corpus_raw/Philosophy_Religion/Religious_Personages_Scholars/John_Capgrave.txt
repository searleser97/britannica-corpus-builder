John Capgrave,  (born April 21, 1393, Lynn, Norfolk, Eng.â€”died  Aug. 12, 1464, Lynn), historian, theologian, and hagiographer who wrote an English Life of St. Katharine, vigorous in its verse form and dramatically energetic in its debate. His work illustrates well the literary tastes and circumstances of his time.
Capgrave became a priest, lectured in theology at Oxford University, and later joined the Augustinian order of hermits at Lynn, where he probably became prior. He was provincial of his order in England and made at least one journey to Rome, the wonders of which are described in his Solace of Pilgrims (ed. C.A. Mills, 1911).
Most of his theological works seem to have been compiled from other authors, or freely translated, and consist of biblical commentaries, lectures, sermons, treatises, and lives of saints. His history in honour of Henry VI is of little historical value, but the latter part of his unfinished Chronicle of England is of some interest. He wrote several lives of saints in English, both in verse and in prose, but the huge Latin collection of the lives of English saints, the Nova Legenda Angliae, attributed to him in the 16th century, was at most edited by him.
