Marcellus II, original name Marcello Cervini,  (born May 6, 1501, Montepulciano, Tuscanyâ€”died  May 1, 1555, Rome), pope from April 9/10 to May 1, 1555. He was one of the few popes in the modern period to retain his baptismal name after becoming pope. He was made cardinal in December 1539 by Pope Paul III, for whom he served in numerous politico-ecclesiastical missions. With Cardinal Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte (later Pope Julius III) and Cardinal Reginald Pole, he presided at the Council of Trent in 1545. A leader in church reform, he succeeded Pope Julius III but died less than a month after being elected pope.
