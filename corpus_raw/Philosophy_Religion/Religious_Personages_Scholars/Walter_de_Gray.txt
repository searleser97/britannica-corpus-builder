Walter de Gray,  Gray also spelled Grey,  (died May 1, 1255, Fulham, Middlesex [now part of London], Eng.), English churchman who rose to high ecclesiastical office through service to King John.
He became chancellor of England in 1205 and, after John had made his peace with the church, was elected bishop of Worcester (1214). In 1215 John advanced him as a candidate for the see of York against the wishes of the cathedral chapter, and Pope Innocent III settled the subsequent appeal in favour of Walter. He played a considerable part in restoring law and order to the North after the baronial revolt.
As archbishop of York, Walter drew up provincial constitutions (1250) and encouraged the building of new churches. At York Minster he built the south transept, where he was later buried. He was one of the first English prelates to keep records of his acts; his registers have survived.
