Henry Barrow,  (born c. 1550, Shipdam, Norfolk, Eng.—died  April 6, 1593, London), lawyer and early Congregationalist martyr who challenged the established Anglican church by supporting the formation of separate and independent churches in England.
After leading a dissolute life as a student at the University of Cambridge, he was converted through the chance hearing of a sermon and became a strict Puritan. Becoming a friend of the Separatist John Greenwood, Barrow was persuaded by him to accept the Brownist position, named for Robert Browne, who advocated the foundation of churches separate from secular governmental authority. Greenwood and Barrow were subsequently imprisoned after refusing to recant their beliefs. During a brief period of freedom in 1592, the two joined Separatists Francis Johnson and John Penry to form their own church.
Taking its government, worship, and discipline from the New Testament, Barrow’s ideal church made no distinction between clergy and laity and stressed the sovereign autonomy of each congregation. Barrow was again imprisoned, however, and in 1593 he and Greenwood were tried before a civil court under the Act of 1581 against writers of seditious books. Barrow had earlier written in prison several works defending Separatism and congregational independency, including A True Description out of the Word of God, of the Visible Church (1589) and A Brief Discovery of the False Church (1590). On March 23, 1593, Barrow and Greenwood were sentenced to die on the scaffold together.
