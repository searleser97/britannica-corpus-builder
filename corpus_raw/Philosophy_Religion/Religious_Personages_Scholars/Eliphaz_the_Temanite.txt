Eliphaz The Temanite,   in the Old Testament Book of Job (chapters 4, 5, 15, 22), one of three friends who sought to console Job, who is a biblical archetype of unmerited suffering. The word Temanite probably indicates that he was an Edomite, or member of a Palestinian people descended from Esau.
In three speeches of increasing severity, Eliphaz attempts to reconcile Job to God and induce him to repent. In the first speech he recounts a mystic vision that informed him of the universal sinfulness of man—proof that suffering is never unmerited. In the second speech he belittles Job’s self-justifications by describing the uncaring transcendence of God. In the third and last speech he reflects the old Hebrew idea that suffering always implies sinful actions by accusing Job of specific unethical deeds. In the epilogue he and his friends are reproved by God for not speaking the truth about him.
