Peter the Venerable, also called Blessed Peter of Montboissier, French Pierre le Vénérable or Bienheureux Pierre de Montboissier,  (born c. 1092, Montboissier, Auvergne, Arles—died December 25, 1156, Cluny, Burgundy), outstanding French abbot of Cluny whose spiritual, intellectual, and financial reforms restored Cluny to its high place among the religious establishments of Europe.
Peter joined Bernard of Clairvaux in supporting Pope Innocent II, thereby weakening the position of the antipope, Anacletus II. After Peter Abelard’s teachings had been condemned at the Council of Sens (1140), Peter received him at Cluny and reconciled him with Bernard and with the Pope. He also tried to convert the Crusades into nonviolent missionary ventures, ordered the first Latin translation of the Qurʾān so that it might be refuted, and was papal ambassador to Aquitaine, Italy, and England. He wrote hymns and poems in addition to theological tracts and left about 200 letters of considerable historiographical interest. Although Peter has not been canonized, his cult received papal approval in 1862.
