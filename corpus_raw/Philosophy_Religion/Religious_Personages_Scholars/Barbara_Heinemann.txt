Barbara Heinemann,  (born Jan. 11, 1795, Leitersweiler, Alsace, Fr.—died  May 21, 1883, Amana, Iowa, U.S.), French-born U.S. spiritual leader of the Community of True Inspiration, also known as the Amana Colony.
The Community of True Inspiration had been founded in 1714 by Pietistic mystics and was revived later by Michael Krausert and Christian Metz. In 1818 Heinemann was “illuminated” with a sense of religious calling. She subsequently became known in the Community as an “inspired instrument”—a prophet and orator. In 1823 Heinemann married George Landmann, a schoolteacher, and the couple emigrated with 800 other Inspirationists to the United States in the mid-1840s. There she led, with Christian Metz, the founding of seven collective religious communities in Iowa, which were called the Amana Colonies.
After Metz died in 1867, Heinemann directed the religious affairs of the community of 1,600. A strict fundamentalist, she outlawed many recreations, the use of cameras, and co-ed play. In 1932 the Amana Society was restructured into a new cooperative organization with greater economic and individual liberties for its members.
