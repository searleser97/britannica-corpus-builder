Zephaniah,  also spelled Sophonias,  (flourished  7th century bc), Israelite prophet, said to be the author of one of the shorter Old Testament prophetical books, who proclaimed the approaching divine judgment. The first verse of the Book of Zephaniah makes him a contemporary of Josiah, king of Judah (reigned c. 640–609 bc). The prophet’s activity, however, probably occurred during the early part of Josiah’s reign, for his criticism of the worship of certain gods in Jerusalem (Baal, Milcom, and the host of the heavens) would have been meaningless after Josiah’s reform, which took place about 623/622 bc.
