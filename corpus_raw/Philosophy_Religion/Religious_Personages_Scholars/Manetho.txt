Manetho,  (flourished c. 300 bce), Egyptian priest who wrote a history of Egypt in Greek, probably commissioned by Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246).
Manetho’s history has not survived except for some fragments of narrative in Josephus’s treatise “Against Apion” and tables of dynasties, kings, and lengths of reigns given in the works of Julius Africanus, Eusebius, and George Syncellus. The fragments thus preserved showed that Manetho’s work was based on good native sources, perhaps both oral and written. These fragments have been of much service to scholars in determining the succession of kings where the archaeological evidence was inconclusive, and Manetho’s division of the rulers of ancient Egypt into 30 dynasties is still used as the basic framework for ancient Egyptian history.
