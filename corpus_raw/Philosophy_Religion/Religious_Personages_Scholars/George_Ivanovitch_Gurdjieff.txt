George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, original name Georgii Ivanovitch Gurdjieff,  (born 1877?, Alexandropol, Armenia, Russian Empire—died  Oct. 29, 1949, Neuilly, near Paris), Greco-Armenian mystic and philosopher who founded an influential quasi-religious movement.
Details of Gurdjieff’s early life are uncertain, but he is thought to have spent his early adult years traveling in Egypt and other parts of the Middle East, India, and especially Central Asia, learning about various spiritual traditions. He moved to Moscow about 1913 and began teaching there and in Petrograd, returning to the Caucasus at the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917.
Rejoined by some followers, Gurdjieff established the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man in 1919 at Tiflis (now Tbilisi), Georgia; it was reestablished at Fontainebleau, France, in 1922. Its members, many from prominent backgrounds, lived a virtually monastic life, except for a few banquets, at which Gurdjieff would engage in probing dialogue and at which his writings were read. Ritual exercises and dance were also part of the regimen, often accompanied by music composed jointly by Gurdjieff and an associate, the composer Thomas de Hartmann. Performers from the institute appeared in Paris in 1923 and in three U.S. cities the following year and brought considerable attention to Gurdjieff’s work. A disciple named P.D. Ouspensky introduced Gurdjieff’s teachings to Western readers in an understandable intellectual form.
Gurdjieff’s basic assertion was that human life as ordinarily lived is similar to sleep; transcendence of the sleeping state required work, but, when it was achieved, an individual could reach remarkable levels of vitality and awareness. The Fontainebleau centre was closed in 1933, but Gurdjieff continued teaching in Paris until his death.
