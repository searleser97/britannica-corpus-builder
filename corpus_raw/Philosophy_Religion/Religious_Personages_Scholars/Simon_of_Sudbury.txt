Simon Of Sudbury, original name Simon Tybald, or Thebaud, or Theobald,  (born, Sudbury, Suffolk, Eng.—died  June 14, 1381, London), archbishop of Canterbury from 1375 and chancellor of England from 1380 who lost his life in the Peasants’ Revolt of 1381.
Simon served for 12 years as an auditor (judge) of the Rota at the papal Curia, and in 1359 Pope Innocent VI employed him in an attempt to persuade King Edward III of England to open peace negotiations with France. As a reward for his services, Simon was appointed bishop of London by Innocent VI in 1361. Sent to Canterbury in May 1375, Simon, in his role as primate, avoided conflict with the state but dealt firmly with his suffragans. John Wycliffe appeared before him in February 1378 to answer charges of heresy. Simon crowned King Richard II on July 16, 1377.
In January 1380 he was appointed chancellor. In the spring of 1381 Kentish rebels under Wat Tyler marched on London; they held Simon and the lord treasurer, Sir Robert Hales, responsible for the oppressive poll tax. When the Tower of London was surrendered to Tyler’s insurgents, Simon, Hales, and two other men were beheaded on Tower Hill.
