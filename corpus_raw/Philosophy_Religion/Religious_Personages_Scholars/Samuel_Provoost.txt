Samuel Provoost,  (born March 11, 1742, New York City, New York [U.S.]—died September 6, 1815), North American colonial and later U.S. clergyman, the first Protestant Episcopal bishop of New York. He was elected June 13, 1786, and was consecrated at Lambeth Palace, London, February 4, 1787, along with Bishop William White of Pennsylvania.
After graduating in 1758 from King’s College (later Columbia University), New York, Provoost studied at St. Peter’s College (Peterhouse), Cambridge. Returning to New York, he was a minister at Trinity Church from 1766 to 1771. He sympathized with the American Revolution, and after it he was chosen a regent of the University of the State of New York (1784), was named chaplain to Congress (1785) and to the U.S. Senate (1789), and succeeded in organizing the Protestant Episcopal Church after the Revolution.
