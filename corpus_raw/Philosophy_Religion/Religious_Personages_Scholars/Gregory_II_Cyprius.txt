Gregory II Cyprius, original name George Of Cyprus,  (born 1241, Cyprus—died  1290, Constantinople, Byzantine Empire [now Istanbul, Turkey]), Greek Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople (1283–89) who strongly opposed reunion of the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches.
In the beginning of his career as a cleric in the Byzantine imperial court, Gregory supported the policy of both his emperor, Michael VIII Palaeologus, and the patriarch of Constantinople, John XI Becchus, favouring a union between the two churches. With the accession in 1282 of the antiunionist emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus, who stressed the individuality and autonomy of the Eastern church, Gregory reversed his position, allying himself with the emperor and battling against Becchus. When mounting pressure on Becchus forced him to resign, Gregory was named to succeed him on the patriarchal throne, with the patronal name of Gregory II replacing his baptismal name of George.
Gregory’s stand against Becchus and against the theology of the Roman Catholic church led him to write Tomos pisteos (“Tome on Faith”), which refuted the Latin position that the Holy Spirit proceeded from God the Son as well as God the Father. The text, however, was denounced as unorthodox by the patriarchs of Alexandria and Antioch; and, along with a subsequent work of apologetics (Homologia), it antagonized both the enemies and supporters of reunion. Continued criticism from the exiled Becchus forced him to resign as patriarch in 1289 and retire to a monastery, where he died the following year.
Although Gregory reveals himself in his writings as a mediocre theologian, he appears as a prime example of 13th-century Byzantine humanism in his literary works. Notable is his autobiography (Diegesis merike), designed to preface his collection of letters.
