J.A. Bengel, in full Johann Albrecht Bengel,  (born June 24, 1687, Winnenden, near Stuttgart, Württemberg [Germany]—died November 2, 1752, Stuttgart), German Lutheran theologian and biblical scholar who was the founder of Swabian Pietism and a pioneer in the critical exegesis of the New Testament.
Bengel studied at Tübingen and in 1713 was appointed professor in a seminary at Denkendorf, where he published his early works on the New Testament. As a student he had been concerned regarding the various readings of the text of the New Testament and sought to develop a critically consistent one. He originated the principle “The more difficult reading is to be preferred.” In 1741 he was made prelate of Herbrechtingen and in 1749 of Alpirspach. Influential in New Testament criticism and theology down to the present day, he held that the scholar should read nothing into the sacred writings that is not there but should draw everything from them and permit nothing to remain hidden that is really in them. Bengel’s major works include Novum Testamentum Graecum (1734), a Greek text of the New Testament that contains a thorough critical appendix, and Gnomon Novi Testamenti (1742), an exegetical commentary.
