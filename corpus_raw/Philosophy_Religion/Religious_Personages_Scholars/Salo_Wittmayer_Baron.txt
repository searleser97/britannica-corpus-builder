Salo Wittmayer Baron,  (born May 26, 1895, Tarnow, Austria [now in Poland]—died  Nov. 25, 1989, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Austrian-born American historian who spent much of his life compiling the multivolume magnum opus A Social and Religious History of the Jews (1937), originally published in three volumes but later revised and expanded into 18 volumes.
Baron, who was ordained a rabbi at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Vienna (1920), earned three doctorate degrees from the University of Vienna: in philosophy (1917), political science (1922), and law (1923). He learned 20 languages and was able to lecture extemporaneously in five of them. He wrote and edited many works on Jewish history and served as a professor at Columbia University in New York City (1930–63).
At the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem on April 24, 1961, Baron set the historic framework for the Israelis’ prosecution case by testifying about anti-Semitism, European Jewry, and the atrocities committed by the Nazis. In 1979 Columbia University established the Salo Wittmayer Baron Chair of Jewish History, Culture and Society in his honour.
