William of Champeaux, French Guillaume de Champeaux, Latin Guglielmus de Campellis,  (born c. 1070, Champeaux, Fr.—died 1121, Châlons-sur-Marne), French bishop, logician, theologian, and philosopher who was prominent in the Scholastic controversy on the nature of universals (i.e., words that can be applied to more than one particular thing).
After studies under the polemicist Manegold of Lautenbach in Paris, the theologian Anselm of Laon, and the philosopher Roscelin at Compiègne, William taught in the cathedral school of Notre Dame, Paris, where he had Peter Abelard among his pupils. He became head of the school and archdeacon of Paris c. 1100, but retired in 1108, probably because of the violent polemics between him and Abelard over the doctrine of universals.
William withdrew to the nearby abbey of Saint-Victor, where—at the school he established with Anselm’s aid—he taught rhetoric, logic, and theology, again having Abelard as his pupil. The abbey flourished under William’s direction, contributing significantly to the mystical trend characteristic of St. Victor. He was consecrated bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne in 1113 and initiated a reform, becoming an advocate of clerical celibacy and a champion of orthodoxy and ecclesiastical investiture. In 1115 he ordained the great Bernard of Clairvaux, who probably studied under him.
William’s surviving works are all theological. The fragmentary De sacramento altaris (“On the Sacrament of the Altar”), the possibly apocryphal De origine animae (“On the Origin of the Soul”), the De essentia Dei (“On the Essence of God”), and the Dialogus seu altercatio cujusdam Christiani et Judaei de fide Catholica (“A Dialogue or Argument of a Certain Christian and Jew on the Catholic Faith”) are printed by J.-P. Migne in Patrologia Latina (“Works of the Latin Fathers”). His logical works are not extant. William’s Sententiae seu Quaestiones (“Sentences or Questions”) is an early systematization of classical Christian doctrine.
