Boniface Of Savoy,   (born c. 1207—died  July 14, 1270, Sainte-Hélène, Savoy), archbishop of Canterbury who, because he was a foreigner and because he attempted to remedy the financial disarray of his see, won the enmity of the English clergy. He succeeded in repaying a portion of the immense debt incurred by his predecessor, Edmund of Abingdon, and is also remembered for the hospital he founded at Maidstone, Kent.
A son of the Count of Savoy, Boniface entered the Carthusian order in his childhood. He was elected bishop of Belley in Burgundy in 1234. After his niece married King Henry III of England, Boniface was, through the King’s influence, chosen in 1241 to serve as archbishop of Canterbury. Circumstances prevented him from taking office until 1244; at that time he also made his first visit to England. Discovering that the see of Canterbury was deeply in debt, he proposed sweeping economies, including the abolition of certain church offices and the exacting of contributions from tenants and clergy.
Late in 1244 he left England to attend the Council of Lyon, where he obtained permission from Pope Innocent IV to institute further measures to raise funds for the see, among them the levying of contributions throughout the province. Upon returning to England in 1249, he came into conflict with local diocesan officials who refused to recognize his authority. In one instance, the dispute erupted into violence and resulted in the excommunication of the Bishop of London. Boniface left for Rome in 1252, to be present in his own defense at proceedings brought against him by his English opponents. A compromise was reached, and Boniface returned to England during the period from 1265 to 1269; he set out on a crusade with King Edward I but died en route. His feast day, July 14, is celebrated in Savoy and by the Carthusians.
