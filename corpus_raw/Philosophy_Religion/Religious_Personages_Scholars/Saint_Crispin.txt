Saints Crispin and Crispinian,  (both b. traditionally Rome—d. c. 286, possibly Soissons, Fr.; feast day October 25), patron saints of shoemakers, whose legendary history dates from the 8th century.
It is said that they were brothers from a noble Roman family and that they travelled to Soissons, where they made many converts while supporting themselves by shoemaking. The emperor Maximian condemned them to death, but they escaped from the ordeals imposed by his prefect Rictiovarus, and at last Maximian had them beheaded. Their remains were buried at Soissons but afterward moved, partly to Osnabrück, Ger., and partly to the chapel of San Lorenzo in Rome; there are also relics at Fulda, Ger. A Kentish tradition claims that their bodies were cast into the sea and floated ashore at Romney Marsh. In medieval France their feast day was the occasion of solemn processions and merrymaking in which guilds of shoemakers took the chief part. In England the day acquired additional importance as the anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt (1415), an event noted in Shakespeare’s Henry V (Act IV, scene 3).
