Paschal (III), original name Guido Da Crema,  (died Sept. 20, 1168, Rome), antipope from 1164 to 1168.
Against Pope Alexander III, he was one of the original supporters of the antipope Victor IV, whom he succeeded on April 22, 1164, becoming the second antipope set up by the Holy Roman emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. Elected through the influence of Rainald of Dassel, Frederick’s chancellor and vicar in Italy, he won only limited allegiance in the empire. By imperial command in 1165 he canonized Charlemagne at Aachen, a decree never confirmed by the church, although Charlemagne is now regarded as having been informally beatified.
Paschal was enthroned when Rome was seized by Frederick, whom Paschal crowned (for a second time) in August 1167, together with his wife, Béatrix. After a sudden outbreak of pestilence destroyed the imperial army, Frederick retreated to Germany in the spring of 1168, accompanied by Paschal.
