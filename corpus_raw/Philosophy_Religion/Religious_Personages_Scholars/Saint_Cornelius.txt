Saint Cornelius,  (born, Rome—died  253, Centumcellae, Italy; feast day September 16), pope from 251 to 253.
A Roman priest, he was elected during the lull in the persecution under Emperor Decius and after the papacy had been vacant for more than a year following Pope St. Fabian’s martyrdom. Cornelius’ pontificate was complicated by a schism, one cause of which was the self-appointment of the Roman priest Novatian as antipope (the second in papal history); and the second, the dispute over the church’s attitude toward Christian apostates. Cornelius was supported by St. Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, and many African and Eastern bishops.
When Christian persecution resumed in 253, Cornelius was exiled to Centumcellae, where he died either from hardships or decapitation. Several of his letters, including some to Cyprian, survive. His feast day is kept with Cyprian’s.
