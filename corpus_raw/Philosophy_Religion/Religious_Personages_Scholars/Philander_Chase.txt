Philander Chase,  (born Dec. 14, 1775, Cornish, N.H.â€”died  Sept. 20, 1852, near Peoria, Ill., U.S.), U.S. clergyman and bishop in the Protestant Episcopal Church, educator, and founder of Kenyon College, Gambier, Ohio.
Ordained a priest in 1799, Chase served several parishes in New York State, New Orleans, and Hartford, Conn., prior to his consecration as bishop for the new Ohio diocese in 1819. Because he felt the needs of the frontier West could best be served by clergy trained in the region, he sought and obtained funds in England and at Gambier in 1824 and founded Kenyon College and its affiliated seminary, Bexley Hall. Criticism by those who considered him to be too arbitrary as an administrator resulted in a dispute over control of the college and caused him to resign his bishopric in 1831. In 1835 he was elected bishop of the new diocese of Illinois, where, near Peoria, he founded Jubilee College and became its first president. He served until his death in both these capacities and also from 1843 as presiding bishop of his denomination.
