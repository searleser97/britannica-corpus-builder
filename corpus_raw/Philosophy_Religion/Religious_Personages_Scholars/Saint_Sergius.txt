Saints Sergius and Bacchus,  (died c. 303, Risafe, Syria; feast day October 7), among the earliest authenticated and most celebrated Christian martyrs, commemorated in the Eastern and Western churches.
Early martyrologies record that Sergius and Bacchus were officers in the Roman army on the Syrian frontier. They were supposedly favourites of the Roman emperor Maximian, whose wrath they incurred by refusing to sacrifice to the pagan god Jupiter because they were Christians. Maximian demoted Sergius and Bacchus, ordering them to be costumed in women’s dress and marched through the streets. They were then sent to Risafe (now a city in ruins in central Syria), where they were scourged so severely that Bacchus died. Boards were nailed to Sergius’s feet, upon which he was forced to walk before being beheaded.
Considerable posthumous homage has been paid the martyrs. In 431 Alexander, metropolitan of Hierapolis, restored the church over Sergius’s grave, and shortly afterward Risafe became a bishopric. The Byzantine emperor Justinian I changed the name of Risafe to Sergiopolis, making it an archdiocese, and in honour of Sergius he had churches built at Constantinople (now Istanbul) and at Acre in Palestine.
The church at Risafe became famous in the East as a major pilgrimage site. Sergius and Bacchus were designated protectors of the Byzantine army, and numerous Eastern sanctuaries and churches were subsequently dedicated to them. Their veneration is old, and a mass ascribed to Pope Gelasius I is assigned to them. Christian desert nomads regard Sergius as their patron saint.
In Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe (1994), American professor and historian John Boswell argued that the relationship between Sergius and Bacchus was romantic in nature and represents a type of early Christian same-sex union. Though this controversial claim has been much debated, the saints are popular in the gay Christian community.
