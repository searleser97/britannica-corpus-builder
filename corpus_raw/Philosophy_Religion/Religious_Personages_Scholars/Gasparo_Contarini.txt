Gasparo Contarini,  (born Oct. 16, 1483, Venice—died Aug. 24, 1542, Bologna), Venetian Humanist scholar, theologian, diplomat, and Roman Catholic cardinal (1535–42), was an advocate of extensive reform within the church and a leader in the movement for reconciliation with the Lutheran Reformers. Initially engaged in polemics with Martin Luther, he later drafted at the Colloquy of Ratisbon (now Regensburg, W. Ger.) the Epistola de justificatione (1541; “Letter on Justification”) that attempted to formulate a theology of salvation acceptable to Lutherans. He was criticized, however, by Counter-Reformers for compromising Roman Catholic teaching.
