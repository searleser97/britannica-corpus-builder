Maurice Freedman,  (born Dec. 11, 1920, London, Eng.—died  July 14, 1975, London), British scholar who was one of the world’s leading experts on Chinese anthropology.
After studying English at King’s College, London, and serving in the Royal Artillery in World War II, Freedman enrolled as a graduate student of anthropology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, where, after doing fieldwork in Singapore, he was offered a lectureship in anthropology in 1951. He became a professor in 1965. During this tenure, he also held visiting appointments at Yale University, the University of Malaya, and Cornell University. In 1970 he accepted a chair at the University of Oxford, where he remained until his death.
Freedman’s Chinese studies can be classified into four phases. The first phase began with his Singapore research, which resulted in works on the Chinese family and marriage, Chinese law, Chinese religion, and Chinese community organization. The second phase occurred in the early 1950s, when, using only archival sources, Freedman began to reconstruct traditional Chinese society with particular attention to the institutions of kinship and marriage. In the third phase he studied what he referred to as “residual China,” notably Hong Kong and Taiwan. The final phase was the study of the intellectual history of sinological anthropology. In this stage, he chronicled the stories of the early attempts at understanding Chinese society.
Freedman’s literary output was large and varied. Some of Freedman’s works are Chinese Family and Marriage in Singapore (1957), Chinese Lineage and Society (1966), and Main Trends in Social and Cultural Anthropology (1979).
