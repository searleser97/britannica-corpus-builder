Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle,  (born Aug. 20, 1517, Besançon, France—died Sept. 21, 1586, Madrid), minister of King Philip II of Spain; he played a major role in the early stages of the Netherlands’ revolt against Philip’s rule.
Granvelle, educated at Padua and at Leuven (Louvain), was ordained priest and, in 1540, consecrated bishop of Arras. Pope Pius IV made him archbishop of Mechelen (1560) and cardinal (1561). In 1560 Philip II appointed Granvelle chief counselor to Margaret of Parma, regent in the Netherlands. His monarchism led him to clash with the Dutch leaders, Prince William the Silent and the counts of Egmont and Hoorn, all of whom opposed Philip’s policy of converting the Netherlands into a Spanish dependency, and they eventually effected Philip’s removal of Granvelle (1564). Later Philip concluded that the Netherlands revolution never would have developed had he supported Granvelle.
From 1565 to 1579 Granvelle served in Italy as viceroy of Naples (1571–75) and as president of the Council for Italy (1575–79). In 1579 Philip appointed him secretary of state (Spain), in which capacity he campaigned against William and the Dutch Protestants and negotiated the union of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns.
