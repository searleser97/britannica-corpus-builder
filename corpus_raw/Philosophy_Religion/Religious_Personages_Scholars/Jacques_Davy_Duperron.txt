Jacques Davy Duperron,   (born Nov. 25, 1556, Bern—died  Sept. 5, 1618, Paris), French cardinal, remembered especially for his part in the conversion of King Henry IV of France to Roman Catholicism.
The son of a Huguenot refugee from Saint-Lô, Normandy, who gave him an excellent humanist education, he returned to France in 1562 and was introduced to Henry III in 1576. He later abjured Protestantism, took holy orders, and, as a reader in Henry’s service, developed a solid reputation as a Catholic churchman attached to the crown’s interests.
After Henry’s death in 1589, Duperron supported the claim of Charles, cardinal de Bourbon, but soon transferred his loyalty to Henry IV. As bishop of Évreux from 1591 he instructed the king in the Catholic religion, and Henry formally abjured his Calvinist faith in 1593. In 1594 Duperron was sent to Rome to obtain absolution for Henry from Pope Clement VIII, which was granted in 1595. In 1600, at a conference at Fontainebleau, he eloquently defended the Catholic position against Protestants Philippe Duplessis-Mornay and Théodore-Agrippa d’Aubigné.
In 1604 Duperron was sent to Rome as chargé d’affaires and was made a cardinal. After Henry’s death he served the regent, Marie de Médicis. During his life he published many philosophical and religious works as well as some dealing with diplomatic affairs. His collected works were published in 1622.
