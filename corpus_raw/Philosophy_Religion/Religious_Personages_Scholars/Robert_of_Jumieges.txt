Robert of Jumièges,  (born, Normandy, France—died c. 1055, Jumièges), one of the Normans given high position by the English king Edward the Confessor.
Robert was prior of Saint-Ouen, Rouen, France, when elected abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Jumièges in 1037 to succeed his kinsman William. Taken to England by King Edward in 1042, he was made bishop of London in 1044. He became Edward’s chief adviser and head of the Norman party and was appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 1051. During his trip to Rome to be confirmed as archbishop by the pope, Robert probably visited Duke William of Normandy (later King William I the Conqueror, of England) and conveyed a promise to the duke of succession to the English throne. Robert influenced Edward to exile the overpowerful Godwine, earl of Wessex; and, when Godwine returned in 1052, Robert himself was banished to the Continent. He retired to Jumièges. The uncanonical usurpation of his see by Stigand, bishop of Winchester, contributed to the papacy’s support of the invasion of England in 1066 by William.
