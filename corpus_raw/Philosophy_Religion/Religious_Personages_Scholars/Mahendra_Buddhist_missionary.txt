Mahendra, Pāli Mahinda,  (born c. 270 bc, Pāṭaliputra, India—died c. 204 bc, Anurādhapura, Ceylon [now Sri Lanka]), propagator of Buddhism in Ceylon. Generally believed to be the son of the Indian emperor Aśoka, he is honoured in Sri Lanka as a founding missionary of that country’s majority religion.
When Aśoka, a convert to Buddhism from Hinduism, sent Mahendra and Princess Saṅghamitthā as missionaries to Ceylon about 251 bc, they converted King Tissa and the royal family, who helped them in the conversion of many of the common people. In the tradition of Aśoka, Mahendra did not propagate Buddhism by force but by works of practical piety and benevolence. Mahendra’s name has not been found in any of the inscriptions of Aśoka, but his existence and works seem substantiated by the Ceylonese chronicles Dīpavaṃsa and Mahāvaṃsa. Other evidence consists of the monuments that the Sinhalese raised in his honour at the Buddhist holy city and ancient Ceylonese capital, Anurādhapura.
