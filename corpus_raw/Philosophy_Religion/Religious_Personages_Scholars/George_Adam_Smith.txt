Sir George Adam Smith,  (born Oct. 19, 1856, Calcutta, India—died  March 3, 1942, Balerno, Midlothian, Scot.), Scottish preacher and Semitic scholar who helped to make generally acceptable the higher criticism of the Old Testament.
Smith was returned to Scotland at the age of two and reared by two aunts. Educated in Edinburgh, with vacation study at Tübingen and Leipzig, he taught at the Free Church College, Aberdeen (1880–82). After ordination he made his reputation as a preacher at Queen’s Cross Free Church, Aberdeen (1882–92), uniting sound scholarship with a vivid sense of the relevance of God’s Word to the listening congregation. These qualities were apparent also in The Book of Isaiah (2 vol., 1888–90; revised 1929). During his tenure of the Old Testament professorship at the Free Church College, Glasgow (1892–1909), he made several lecture tours in the U.S. and published The Historical Geography of the Holy Land (1894; revised 1931), the outcome of detailed observation and investigation in Palestine; it proved invaluable to Gen. Sir Edmund (later Viscount) Allenby in the Palestine campaign of 1917. At Glasgow, Smith also wrote The Book of the Twelve Prophets (2 vol., 1896–98; revised 1928); Modern Criticism and the Preaching of the Old Testament (1901); and Jerusalem (2 vol., 1907–08). The advanced views of Modern Criticism (lectures delivered at Yale) nearly led to a process for heresy against him at home. As principal of the University of Aberdeen (1909–35) he wrote The Early Poetry of Israel (1913) and Jeremiah (1923), was knighted in 1916, and was moderator of the General Assembly of the United Free Church of Scotland, 1916–17.
