Frantisek Tomasek,  (born June 30, 1899, Studénka, Moravia, Austrian Empire [now in Czech Republic]—died  Aug. 4, 1992, Prague, Czech.), Roman Catholic cardinal, archbishop of Prague (1977–91), whose cautious but resolute opposition to the Czechoslovak communist regime helped to bring about its peaceful demise in the 1989 Velvet Revolution.
After being ordained (1922), Tomasek taught in Olomouc at the Saints Cyril and Methodius Theological Faculty (1934–40), where he also received a doctorate (1938). He completed his second doctorate and continued teaching in the brief time that the school remained open after the Nazi occupation (1939–44) and before the 1948 communist takeover. Shortly after being consecrated auxiliary bishop of Olomouc (1949), he was arrested and interned in a labour camp until 1954, when he was released to serve as a parish priest.
Tomasek was unexpectedly sent as a representative to the Second Vatican Council (1962–65), and when the archbishop of Prague, Josef Cardinal Beran, was forbidden to return from Rome, Tomasek was appointed apostolic administrator of Prague. He was secretly elevated to cardinal in 1976 and was publicly proclaimed archbishop of Prague in December 1977. Although he had supported the brief period of liberalization (the Prague Spring) in 1968, he remained conciliatory to the government until Pope John Paul II encouraged him in 1978 to take a more active role in the dissident human-rights movement.
