St. Geneviève, French Sainte Geneviève, German Sankt Genovefa,  (born c. 422, Nanterre, France?—died c. 500, Paris; feast day January 3), patron saint of Paris, who allegedly saved that city from the Huns.
When she was seven, Geneviève was induced by Bishop St. Germain of Auxerre to dedicate herself to the religious life. On the death of her parents she moved to Paris, where she was noted for her piety and acts of charity. She had numerous prophetic visions and is said to have predicted the invasion of the Huns. When Attila threatened Paris in 451, she persuaded the inhabitants to remain and pray, assuring them that the attack would be inconsequential and that they had the protection of heaven. Attila’s army went on to Orléans, 110 km (70 miles) from Paris, and was defeated. Geneviève is reported to have had great influence over King Childeric I of the Salian Franks and, in 460, to have had a church built over the tomb of St. Denis, a patron saint of France.
She was buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles, popularly known as the Church of Sainte-Geneviève. During the French Revolution in 1793, her body was burned on the Place de Grève; the relics were enshrined in the Church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, where they still attract pilgrims. She is often depicted with a loaf of bread to represent her generosity.
