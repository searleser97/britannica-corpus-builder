Claude Joseph Goldsmid Montefiore,  (born June 6, 1858, London—died  July 9, 1938, London), Jewish theologian and Reform leader; the first modern Jew to write an important commentary on the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Luke, and Mark).
Montefiore enrolled in a Reform seminary in Berlin with the intention of becoming a rabbi but abandoned this idea and returned to England. He retained, however, his belief in Reform Judaism (q.v.; called Liberal in England). Throughout his life Montefiore was a Liberal leader, helping to found the Jewish Religious Union (in 1902) and serving as president of the World Union for Progressive Judaism from 1926 until his death.
He first gained fame through the Hibbert Lectures, delivered in 1892 at Oxford, on “The Origin and Growth of Religion as Illustrated by the Religion of the Ancient Hebrews.” In 1909 he published The Synoptic Gospels and the following year delivered the Benjamin Jowett lectures at Oxford on “Some Elements of the Religious Teaching of Jesus According to the Synoptic Gospels.” More than any other Jewish scholar up to his time, Montefiore paid full tribute to Jesus’ power as a prophet. He stated, unlike other Jewish scholars, that Jesus’ ethics are valuable precisely because they are almost beyond the grasp of humanity. He wrote that, although Jews can profit from reading the New Testament, true Judaism is found in the Old Testament, a statement that refutes the charge that Montefiore flirted with Christianity.
When he was nearly 80 Montefiore collaborated with the Orthodox scholar, H. Loewe, in editing A Rabbinic Anthology. This work is doubly remarkable because Reform Jews deny the authority of the Talmud, the rabbinical compendium of law, lore, and commentary. In the Anthology, Montefiore attempts to dispel the notion that Christianity developed a completely new and valuable ethic in contradistinction to the teachings of the rabbis, which many Christians had long held to be crude and primitive. Noted as a philanthropist as well as a great scholar, he helped found and edit the Jewish Quarterly Review. He was a grandnephew of Sir Moses Montefiore.
