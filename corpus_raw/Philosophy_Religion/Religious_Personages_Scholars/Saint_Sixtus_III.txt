Saint Sixtus III, also spelled Xystus,  (born, Rome—died  Aug. 19, 440; feast day March 28), pope from 432 to 440.
A chief Roman priest when he succeeded Pope St. Celestine I on July 31, 432, Sixtus had previously been suspected of favouring Pelagianism (heretical doctrine that minimized the role of divine grace in man’s salvation), but on becoming pope he disappointed the Pelagians’ expectations and repelled their attempts to rejoin with Rome.
Sixtus was a conciliator, and in 433 he witnessed the restoration of church peace after he helped settle a Christological dispute following the Council (431) of Ephesus between patriarchs St. Cyril of Alexandria and John of Antioch. He sustained calm relations with the East; the only notable incident of minor disturbance took place in 437, when a Constantinopolitan synod tried to encroach on the pope’s rights in Illyria (the northwestern part of the Balkan Peninsula) and on those of the Antiochene patriarchate. When Proclus, the new patriarch of Constantinople, attempted to impose the synod’s decisions on the Illyrian bishops, Sixtus reminded them of their obligation toward his vicar in Thessaloníki (modern Salonika, Greece).
Sixtus III sponsored important building projects in Rome in the aftermath of the sacking of the city by the Visigoths in 410, including a reconstruction of the Liberian Basilica (now St. Mary Major) and the erection of a second basilica adjoining the 4th-century church of St. Lawrence Outside the Walls.
