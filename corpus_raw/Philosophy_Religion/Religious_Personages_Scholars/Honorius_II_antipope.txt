Honorius (II), original name Peter Cadelo,  Latin Cadalus,  (born 1009/10, Verona?, March of Verona and Aquileia [Italy]—died  1072, Parma?, Lombardy), antipope from 1061 to 1064.
As bishop of Parma (c.. 1045), he opposed the church reform movement of the second half of the 11th century led by Cardinal Hildebrand (later Pope Gregory VII). With his fellow reformers, Hildebrand had swayed the election of Alexander II as pope (Sept. 30, 1061), without the sanction of the Holy Roman emperor.
Aided by Lombard and German bishops, Empress Agnes—mother of the German king Henry IV (later emperor)—had Cadalus chosen pope at Basel, Upper Burgundy, as Honorius II (Oct. 28, 1061). He was installed at Rome by force of arms in April 1062. Duke Godfrey of Tuscany succeeded in persuading Honorius and Alexander to await an imperial decision over which contender was the legal pope. The schism soon ceased, for Agnes lost the regency when Henry was kidnapped by a group of nobles led by Archbishop Anno of Cologne. Anno, Agnes’ successor, ordered an investigation that chose Alexander as pope. In May 1063 Cadalus again established himself in Rome but left in 1064, when the Council of Mantua, Tuscany, favoured Alexander. Cadalus then retired to Parma, where he lived in obscurity, apparently maintaining his claims to the end.
