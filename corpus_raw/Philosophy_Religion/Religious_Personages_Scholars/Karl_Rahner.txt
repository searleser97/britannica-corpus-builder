Karl Rahner,  (born March 5, 1904, Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden, Ger.—died March 30, 1984, Innsbruck, Austria), German Jesuit priest who is widely considered to have been one of the foremost Roman Catholic theologians of the 20th century. He is best known for his work in Christology and for his integration of an existential philosophy of personalism with Thomistic realism, by which human self-consciousness and self-transcendence are placed within a sphere in which the ultimate determinant is God.
Rahner was ordained in 1932. He studied at the University of Freiburg under Martin Heidegger before earning a doctorate at the University of Innsbruck. He taught at the universities of Innsbruck, Munich, and Münster. He was also an editor of Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche, 10 vol. (1957–68; “Lexicon for Theology and the Church”), and of Sacramentum Mundi, 6 vol. (1968–70; “Sacrament of the World”). He was known as well for his defense of Edward Schillebeeckx in 1968, when the Flemish theologian was under attack for heresy as a result of his calls for more freedom of theological research within the church and for theological pluralism.
Rahner’s many books emphasize the continuity of modern and ancient interpretations of Roman Catholic doctrine. His works include Geist in Welt (1939; Spirit in the World), Hörer des Wortes (1941; Hearers of the Word), Sendung und Gnade, 3 vol. (1966; Mission and Grace), Grundkurs des Glaubens (1976; Foundations of Christian Faith), and Die siebenfältige Gabe: über die Sakramente der Kirche (1974; Meditations on the Sacraments). All 23 volumes of his Theological Investigations have been published in English translation (1961–92).
