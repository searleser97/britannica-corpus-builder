John Dunmore Lang,  (born Aug. 25, 1799, Greenock, Scot.â€”died  Aug. 8, 1878, Sydney), Australian churchman and writer, founder of the Australian Presbyterian Church, and an influence in shaping colonization of that continent.
Lang studied at the University of Glasgow, was ordained in September 1822, and was sent to Australia in 1823 on behalf of the established Church of Scotland to be its first regular minister there. In 1836 he persuaded the English government to subsidize those who wished to emigrate to Australia, which had hitherto been settled largely by convicts. He also recruited ministers and teachers for the Australian church. He served in the legislature for a number of years as the representative of Port Philip, Moreton Bay, and Sydney. He visited England six times, mainly to encourage the emigration of upper-working-class Protestants to Australia.
