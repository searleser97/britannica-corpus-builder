St. Hugh of Lincoln,  (born c. 1140, Avalon, France—died November 16, 1200, London, England; canonized 1220; Anglican feast day November 16), French-born bishop of Lincoln, England, who became the first Carthusian monk to be canonized.
On his mother’s death when he was eight, Hugh and his father, Lord William of Avalon, joined the canons regular at Villard-Bonnot, France. After his father’s death, Hugh joined (c. 1165) the monks at the Carthusian motherhouse of La Grande Chartreuse near Grenoble, France. He was ordained a priest and later became procurator of the house (c. 1170). In 1179/80 King Henry II of England appointed him as the first prior of the Carthusian house at Witham, in Essex, a royal foundation. Henry’s interest in Hugh’s work secured his election to the see of Lincoln in 1186. Both as prior and as bishop, Hugh consistently defended the church’s liberties, gaining a remarkable degree of respect from the English monarchy. When in France (1200) to promote peace between King John of England and King Philip Augustus of France, Hugh revisited La Grande Chartreuse. Upon his return, he fell ill, died, and was buried in Lincoln Cathedral (November 24, 1200). Among the many biographies of Hugh are those by H. Thurston (1898), R.M. Woolley (1927), and Joseph Clayton (1931).
