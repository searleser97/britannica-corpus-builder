Jean-Jacques Olier,  (born Sept. 20, 1608, Paris, Fr.—died  April 2, 1657, Paris), founder of the Sulpicians, a group of secular priests dedicated to training candidates for the priesthood.
Ordained a priest in 1633, Olier soon came under the influence of St. Vincent de Paul, founder of a congregation of missionaries known as Lazarists. In 1641 Olier established at Vaugirard, Fr., a seminary for the training of priests, which he moved to Paris the following year when he was made pastor of Saint-Sulpice. The school became known as Saint-Sulpice Seminary, and the French government approved the Society of Saint-Sulpice (Sulpicians) in 1645. Olier’s writings, edited in 1856 by J.P. Migne, concentrate on the spiritual direction of priests.
