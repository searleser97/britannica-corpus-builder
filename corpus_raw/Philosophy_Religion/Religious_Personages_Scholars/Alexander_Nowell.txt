Alexander Nowell,  (born c. 1507, Whalley, Lancashire, England—died February 13, 1602, London), English scholar, Anglican priest, and dean of St. Paul’s Cathedral in London whose tactless preaching brought him into disfavour with Queen Elizabeth I. He was the author of the catechism still used by the Church of England.
Made master of Westminster School, London, in 1543, Nowell became prebendary at Westminster Abbey in 1551. On the accession of the Catholic queen Mary I in 1553, he was deprived of his position and fled to Europe, where at Strassburg and Frankfurt he developed Puritan views. When Mary was succeeded in 1558 by Elizabeth I, who promised religious toleration, he returned to England and received the deanery of St. Paul’s, a post he held until his death. His sermons frequently antagonized Elizabeth; on one occasion in 1564 she interpreted his remarks against veneration of the crucifix as alluding to one she kept in the royal chapel.
Nowell’s “Small Catechism,” inserted before the order of confirmation in the Prayer Book of 1549 and supplemented in 1604, remains the official Anglican catechism. He was also the author of a “Larger Catechism” and a “Middle Catechism,” designed for school use, both printed in 1570.
