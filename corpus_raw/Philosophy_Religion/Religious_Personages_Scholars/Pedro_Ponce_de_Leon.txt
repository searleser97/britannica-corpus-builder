Pedro Ponce de León,  (born 1520?—died 1584), Spanish Benedictine monk believed to have been the first person to develop a method for teaching the deaf.
Ponce achieved his first success with Gaspard Burgos, a deaf man who, because of his difficulty with oral communication, had been denied membership in the Benedictine order. Under Ponce’s tutelage, Burgos learned to speak so that he could make his confession. Burgos later wrote a number of books. Ponce taught several other deaf persons to speak and write, although details of his methods either were never recorded or have been lost. He apparently traced letters and indicated pronunciation with lip movements to introduce and develop speech among his students.
