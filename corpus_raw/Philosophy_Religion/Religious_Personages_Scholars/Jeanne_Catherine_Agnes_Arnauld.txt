Jeanne-Catherine-Agnès Arnauld, byname Mère Agnès,  (born 1593—died  1671), abbess of the Jansenist centre of Port-Royal and author of the religious community’s Constitutions (1665). She was one of six sisters of the prominent Jansenist theologian Antoine Arnauld (the Great Arnauld).
Like her older sister, the abbess Mère Angélique (Jacqueline-Marie-Angélique Arnauld), Jeanne Arnauld entered the cloister at an early age. From 1630 to 1636 she governed the Cistercian monastery of Tard, near Dijon. She then returned to Port-Royal, where she was twice elected abbess (1636; 1658). In August 1664, during the period of persecution of Jansenists in France (1661–69), she was removed to a convent at Chaillot and detained there in an attempt to force from her a statement condemning Jansenism. In 1665, with the other nuns from Port-Royal de Paris who had refused to subscribe to the anti-Jansenist formulary, Mère Agnès was transferred to the community’s original house, Port-Royal des Champs, near Versailles. After the so-called Peace of Clement IX (1669), which suspended the persecutions, she lived peacefully and was held in general veneration. Mère Agnès was considered a spiritual writer of some distinction, although few of her works were published.
