Simon Kimbangu,  (born c. September 12, 1887, Nkamba, near Thysville, Congo Free State [now Mbanza-Ngungu, Democratic Republic of the Congo]—died October 10, 1951, Élisabethville, Belgian Congo [now Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo]), Congolese religious leader who founded a separatist church known as the Kimbanguist church.
Brought up in a British Baptist Missionary Society mission, Kimbangu suddenly became famous among the Bakongo people of Lower Congo in April 1921. He was reputed to heal the sick and raise the dead, and thousands came to hear his preaching. He was called Ngunza, the Kikongo word for “prophet” in the Baptist translation of the Bible.
Although Kimbangu’s preaching had no overtly political content, Belgian authorities, alarmed by the disturbances that he provoked, arrested him and his immediate followers in September 1921. He was condemned to death, but his sentence was commuted; he spent the rest of his life in prison in Élisabethville. Meanwhile, his followers and imitators spread “Ngunzism,” or, as it came to be called, Kimbanguism, in the Belgian Congo and the neighbouring French Congo and Angola. During the African nationalist ferment of the 1950s, Kimbanguists from Nkamba, led by the youngest of the prophet’s three sons, Joseph Diangienda (Diangienda ku Ntima), founded the Kimbanguist church, which received official recognition in September 1959.
