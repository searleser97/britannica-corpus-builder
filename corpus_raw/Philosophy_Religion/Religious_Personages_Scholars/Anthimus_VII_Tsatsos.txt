Anthimus VII Tsatsos,   (born c. 1835, possibly Ioánnina, Greece—died  December 1913, Halki, Tur.), Eastern Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople (1895–96), theologian, orator, and a leading critic of the Roman Catholic Church.
Like Anthimus VI, his predecessor of a half-century earlier, Anthimus VII is known for his encyclical letter to the Orthodox world refuting a papal encyclical, Praeclara Gratulationis (“Splendid Rejoicing”) of Pope Leo XIII (June 20, 1894), which proposed grounds for the reunion of the Orthodox and Roman churches. Besides citing the traditional Eastern arguments attacking Western corruption of early Christian doctrine, Anthimus made new charges occasioned by Roman Catholic teaching formulated during the 19th century. He accused the Latin Church of introducing novel approaches to Christian faith, viz., Pope Pius IX’s solemn pronouncement in 1854 of the dogma of the Virgin Mary’s Immaculate Conception (i.e., the divine act exempting her from original sin) and the first Vatican Council’s (1869–70) decree on papal infallibility, which held as necessary for salvation belief in the pope’s exemption from error when treating of doctrine and morality.
