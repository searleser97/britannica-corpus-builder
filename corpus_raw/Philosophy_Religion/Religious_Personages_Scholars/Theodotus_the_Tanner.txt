Theodotus The Tanner,  (flourished  2nd century), principal exponent at Rome of the heresy of Adoptionism (see Monarchianism).
A wealthy and cultured tanner of Byzantium, Theodotus went to Rome c. 189 during the reign of Pope Victor I. He soon developed a following with his Dynamic Monarchianism.
Condemned and excommunicated by Pope Victor in 190, Theodotus nevertheless continued to acquire disciples, forming the Theodotians, a sect that lasted into the 3rd century under another Theodotus, the Money-changer.
