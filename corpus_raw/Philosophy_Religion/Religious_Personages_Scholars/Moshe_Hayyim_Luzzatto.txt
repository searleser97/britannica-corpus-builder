Moshe Ḥayyim Luzzatto,  (born 1707, Padua, Venetian republic [Italy]—died  May 6, 1747, Acre, Palestine [now ʿAkko, Israel]), Jewish cabalist and writer, one of the founders of modern Hebrew poetry.
Luzzatto wrote lyrics and about 1727 the drama Migdal ʿoz (“Tower of Victory”), but he early turned to cabalist studies, eventually becoming convinced that he was receiving divine revelation and, finally, that he was the Messiah. After being expelled by the Italian rabbis, he moved to Amsterdam (1736), where he wrote his morality play La-yesharim tehilah (Praise for Uprightness) and an ethical work, Mesilat yesharim (1740; The Path of the Upright), which still ranks as a classic.
