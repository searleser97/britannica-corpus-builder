Simeon ben Zemah Duran, also called (by acronym) Rashbaz,  (born 1361, Majorca, Balearic Islands [now part of Spain]—died  1444, Algiers [Algeria]), first Spanish Jewish rabbi to be paid a regular salary by the community and author of an important commentary on Avot (“Fathers”), a popular ethical tractate in the Talmud, the rabbinical compendium of law, lore, and commentary. Before the 14th century, the rabbinical post had been almost invariably honorary; Duran set a precedent in accepting a salary. His commentary Magen Avot (“The Shield of the Fathers”), which influenced the great medieval Jewish philosopher Joseph Albo, is important for reducing the Thirteen Articles of Faith of Moses Maimonides (1135–1204) to three essential dogmas: the existence of God, the divine origin of Jewish law, and the reality of divine reward and retribution.
