Charles Gore,  (born Jan. 22, 1853, Wimbledon, Surrey, Eng.—died  Jan. 17, 1932, London), English theologian, Anglican bishop, and an exponent of the liberal tendency within the Anglo-Catholic movement. He demonstrated a willingness to accept historical criticism of the Bible.
Ordained in 1878, Gore served in a variety of college positions before 1894, when he began a seven-year ministry as canon of Westminster. He was also senior (superior) of the Community of the Resurrection from its foundation in 1892 until 1901. Consecrated bishop of Worcester in 1902, he moved to the new see of Birmingham in 1905 and to Oxford in 1911. He resigned in 1919 and settled in London, where he preached and wrote extensively, lectured at King’s College, and served the University of London as dean of the theological faculty (1924–28).
Gore expounded the Anglo-Catholic view of the church as the legitimate successor of the Apostles in The Ministry of the Christian Church (1888) and Roman Catholic Claims (1888). Unlike some Anglo-Catholics, however, he did not think it sufficient to confront the aggressive secularism of the time with a blunt affirmation of the church’s supernatural life and apostolic authority. It was also necessary, he believed, to correlate Christian theology with scientific and historical knowledge and translate it into social action. This conviction found expression in Lux Mundi: A Series of Studies in the Religion of the Incarnation (1889), which Gore edited and which became a major text of liberal Anglo-Catholicism. He also wrote The Incarnation of the Son of God (1891), Reconstruction of Belief, 3 vol. (1921–24), Christ and Society (1928), and The Philosophy of the Good Life (1930).
