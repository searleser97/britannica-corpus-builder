Innocent (III), original name Lando Di Sezze,  (born, Sezze, Papal States—died, La Cava, Apulia), last of four antipopes (1179–80) during the pontificate of Alexander III. A member of a family of German origin, he was a cardinal when elected on Sept. 29, 1179, by a faction opposing Alexander, who, in January 1180, relegated Innocent to the southern Italian abbey of SS. Trinità in La Cava, where he died.
