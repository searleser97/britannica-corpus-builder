Nicholas III,  (flourished  11th century), Eastern Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople (1084–1111), theologian and liturgical scholar noted for combatting doctrinal heresy and composing sacramental prayer texts for the Byzantine liturgy. Among Nicholas’ liturgical compositions are prayers and responses in the service rituals for baptism, marriage, confession, fasting, and communion.
As emperor Alexis I Comnenus was negotiating with Pope Urban II the possibility of Western help against the Turks, Nicholas was consulted about the state of ecclesiastical relations between Rome and Constantinople. He expressed himself in favour of Church union, provided that the Pope send him an Orthodox confession of faith. He rejected any departure from Greek Orthodox doctrine and practice, including universal papal authority, the Latin concept of the Holy Spirit (Filioque question), and the use of unleavened bread in the Communion service. Frequently intervening in monastic affairs, Nicholas strengthened discipline in the community of Mt. Athos (Greece) and probably wrote a monastic Rule (Typikon) adapted from the original text of the early Palestinian monastic founder St. Sabas.
In a final theological judgment, Nicholas condemned as heretical the Bogomil leader Basil the Physician and his adherents, an exclusive sect originating in Bulgaria and teaching a form of religious dualism that held that the devil created the material world. In 1118 the emperor Alexius had Basil burned at the stake, the only example of this in Byzantine history.
