Jean Balue,  (born c. 1421, Angles-sur-l’Anglin, Poitou, France—died  1491, Ancona, Papal States [Italy]), French cardinal, the treacherous minister of King Louis XI.
Of humble parentage, Balue was first patronized by the bishop of Poitiers. In 1461 he became vicar-general of the bishop of Angers. His activity, cunning, and mastery of intrigue gained him the appreciation of Louis XI, who made him his almoner. In a short time Balue came to be a considerable personage. In 1465 he received the bishopric of Évreux; the king made him le premier du grant conseil and, in spite of Balue’s dissolute life, obtained for him a cardinalate (1468). But in that year also, Balue was compromised in the king’s humiliation by Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, at Péronne and was excluded from the council.
Balue then intrigued with Charles against his master; their secret correspondence was intercepted, and on April 23, 1469, Balue was thrown into prison, where he remained 11 years, but not, as has been alleged, in an iron cage. In 1480, through the intervention of Pope Sixtus IV, he was set at liberty and from that time lived in high favour at the court of Rome. He received the bishopric of Albano and afterward that of Palestrina. In 1484 he was even sent to France as a legate.
