William Warham,  (born c. 1450, Malshanger, Hampshire, England—died August 22, 1532, Canterbury, Kent), last of the pre-Reformation archbishops of Canterbury, a quiet, retiring intellectual who nonetheless closed his career with a resolute stand against the anticlerical policies of King Henry VIII of England. His natural death perhaps prevented a martyrdom similar to that of the earlier archbishop whom he revered, St. Thomas Becket.
Warham was educated at New College, Oxford (doctor of civil law, 1486), served as master of the rolls for several years before his formal appointment to the office (1494), and was frequently employed by Henry VII on diplomatic missions. He was ordained priest in 1493, became bishop of London and keeper of the great seal in 1502, and in January 1504 was made archbishop of Canterbury and lord chancellor. However, he proved to be rather colourless in this eminent position and was easily eclipsed, in the reign of Henry VIII, by Thomas Wolsey, to whom he had to surrender the chancellorship in 1515. As cardinal and papal legate, Wolsey thereafter aggressively interfered with Warham’s ecclesiastical administration of the archbishopric. Wolsey’s fall in 1529 came too late to revive the fortunes of Warham, because the archbishop, though trained as a lawyer to serve the crown without question, could not follow Henry VIII into the first stages of the Reformation. After presiding submissively over the convocation (1531) that declared Henry to be the head of the Church in England, Warham bravely published (February 1532) a dignified but emphatic protest against the enactments of the Reformation Parliament from 1529. He died shortly thereafter.
