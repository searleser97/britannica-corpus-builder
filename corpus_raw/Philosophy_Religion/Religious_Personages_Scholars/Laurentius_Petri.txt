Laurentius Petri, Swedish Lars Petersson,  (born 1499, Örebro, Sweden—died October 26, 1573, Uppsala), Lutheran churchman, a leader of the Protestant Reformation in Sweden and the first Protestant archbishop of Uppsala (1531–73).
His influence was very great, although he was less dynamic and forceful than his brother Olaus. The Swedish Bible of 1541, for which he was principally responsible, was as important for Swedish life and literature as Luther’s German translation was for the German-speaking peoples. His kyrkoordning (church order) of 1571 defined the practice of the church, particularly its relation to government. It went far toward establishing the independence of the church from the crown, which has been characteristic of most of the history of the Swedish Lutheran Church.
