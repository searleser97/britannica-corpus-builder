Chandidas,  (flourished 15th century, Bengal, India), poet whose love songs addressed to the washerwoman Rami were popular in the medieval period and were a source of inspiration to the Vaishnava-Sahajiya religious movement that explored parallels between human and divine love.
The popularity of Chandidasâ€™s songs inspired much imitation, making it difficult to establish firmly the identity of the poet. Furthermore, the details of his life have been overlaid with legend. The poems themselves relate that the author was a Brahman and a village priest (in either the village Chhatna in Bankura district or Nannur in Birbhum district) who broke with tradition by openly declaring his love for the low-caste Rami. The lovers viewed their relationship as sacred, the closest possible analogy to the spiritual union of the divine lovers Radha and Krishna. Chandidas refused to relinquish either his temple duties or his love for Rami, much to the chagrin of his family. A feast to placate the village Brahmans was prepared but was thrown into confusion by the unexpected appearance of Rami.
What happened afterward is obscured by legend. One version relates that Chandidas assumed the form of Vishnu; another claims that he was dismissed as priest and fasted to death as a protest but came to life again on the funeral pyre. A third version (based on poems supposedly written by Rami) states that he was whipped to death while tied to the back of an elephant, on the orders of the nawab of Gaur, for having attracted the attention of the Begum.
The poetry of Chandidas had a strong influence on later Bengali art, literature, and religious thought. In the Vaishnava-Sahajiya movement, the love of a man for the wife of another or for a woman of unsuitably low caste was praised above others for its intensity in the face of social disapproval.
