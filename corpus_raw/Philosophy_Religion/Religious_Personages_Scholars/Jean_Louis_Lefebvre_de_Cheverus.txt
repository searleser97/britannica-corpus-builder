Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus,  (born Jan. 28, 1768, Mayenne, Fr.â€”died  July 19, 1836, Bordeaux), first Roman Catholic bishop of Boston.
He was made assistant, then pastor, of Notre-Dame of Mayenne in France, but because of the Revolution he fled in 1792 to England, where he founded Tottenham Chapel. Arriving in Boston (1796), he assisted at Holy Cross Church and served Indian missions in Maine. His courage and charity during the yellow fever epidemic of 1798 and his eloquent preaching attracted many Protestants. In 1808 the diocese of Boston was created with Cheverus as its bishop; he was consecrated in 1810. At the insistence of King Louis XVIII he returned to France (1823) to become bishop of Montauban. In 1826 he was made archbishop of Bordeaux and peer of France, serving in the upper chamber of the legislature until 1830. Nominated by Louis-Philippe to the college of cardinals, he was invested in 1836.
