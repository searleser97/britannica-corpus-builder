Hirata Atsutane,   (born Sept. 25, 1776, Akita, Japan—died  Oct. 4, 1843, Akita), Japanese thinker, systematizer, and leader of the Restoration Shintō (also known as Fukko Shintō; q.v.) school. His thought, stressing the divine nature of the emperor, exerted a powerful influence on royalists who fought for the restoration of imperial rule during the second half of the 19th century.
At the age of 20, Hirata moved to Edo (modern Tokyo), where most of his activity developed. He originally studied Neo-Confucianism but then turned to Shintō, becoming a disciple of the recently deceased Motoori Norinaga, one of the pioneers of the movement called National Learning (Kokugaku), which sought to find the true expression of the Japanese spirit in Japan’s early traditions and culture. But while Motoori sought for the real Japanese spirit through careful philological study, Hirata attempted to develop a Shintō theological system that would provide normative principles for social and political action. In his later years he became increasingly critical of the Tokugawa feudal regime, which ruled Japan through the office of shogun, forcing the emperor to be nothing more than a powerless symbol. As a result of his political activities, Hirata was confined to his birthplace for the rest of his life.
Hirata vigorously proclaimed a belief in Japan’s natural superiority as the land of the gods; he held that the gods transmit the “True Way” to Japan through the Japanese imperial line. But despite his strong nationalism and xenophobia, he did not hesitate to accept certain features of Western science known to him through Chinese translations. He even appropriated for his Shintō theology some aspects of theological works written by Jesuit missionaries in China.
