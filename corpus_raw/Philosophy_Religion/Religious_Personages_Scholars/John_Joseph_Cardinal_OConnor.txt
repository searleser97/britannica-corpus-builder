John Joseph Cardinal O’Connor ,  (born January 15, 1920, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died May 3, 2000, New York, New York), American Roman Catholic prelate, who served as the archbishop of New York (1984–2000) and was regarded as the Vatican’s leading spokesman in the United States.
Born into a working-class family, O’Connor early decided to become a priest, and he studied at the St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia. He was ordained in 1945 and later earned a Ph.D. (1970) from Georgetown University. In 1952 he joined the U.S. Navy as a military chaplain, ministering to soldiers in both the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He rose to become the U.S. Navy’s chief of chaplains before retiring from the military—with the rank of rear admiral—in 1979. He then served as auxiliary bishop of New York to Terence Cardinal Cooke from 1979 to 1983, when he was named bishop of Scranton, Pennsylvania. In 1984 O’Connor was appointed archbishop of New York by Pope John Paul II and was elevated to cardinal a year later.
An ardent traditionalist, O’Connor was an outspoken defender of Roman Catholic teaching on sexual and moral ethics, and his views often caused controversy. A staunch foe of abortion, he provoked an outcry in 1990 when he stated that Roman Catholics who were in favour of abortion should be excommunicated. He was also steadfast in his opposition to the death penalty, immigration controls, and cuts in welfare programs. Among the other causes he supported was workers’ rights, and he led efforts toward Catholic-Jewish reconciliation. O’Connor wrote several books, including A Chaplain Looks at Vietnam (1968), In Defense of Life (1981), and His Eminence and Hizzoner (1989; written with former New York City Mayor Ed Koch). In March 2000 O’Connor was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.
