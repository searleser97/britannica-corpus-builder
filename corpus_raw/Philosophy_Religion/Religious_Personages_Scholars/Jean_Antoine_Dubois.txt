Jean-Antoine Dubois,   (born 1765, Saint-Remèze, Fr.—died  Feb. 17, 1848, Paris), French educator, abbot, and priest who attempted to convert the Hindus of India to Roman Catholicism.
Ordained in 1792, he sailed to India under the Missions Étrangères. Despite his efforts in many parts of South India, his mission failed, and he returned to Paris (1823), convinced that the conversion of the Hindus was impossible. In Paris he became director of the Missions Étrangères and later superior (1836–39). He translated the Pañca-tantra into French (1826), including Aventures de Paramarta, or The Exploits of the Guru Paramarta. His best-known book is considered to be Moeurs, institutions et cérémonies des peuples de l’Inde (1825; published first in English as Description of the Character, Manners and Customs of the People of India, 1817).
