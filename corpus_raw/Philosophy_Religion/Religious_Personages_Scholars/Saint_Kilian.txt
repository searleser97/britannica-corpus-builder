Saint Kilian,  (born c. 640, Mullagh, County Cavan?, Ire.—died c. 689, Würzburg, Franconia [Germany]; feast day July 8), missionary bishop who, with his companions Saints Colman and Totnan, gave his life for the Christianization of Thuringia and eastern Franconia. At Würzburg, in about 689, all three were beheaded by orders of Duke Gozbert of Würzburg, whom Kilian had supposedly converted and baptized. In 752 Bishop Burchard of Würzburg had their relics solemnly transferred to his cathedral. Kilian is a favourite patron in the Würzburg region and is venerated in Vienna and in Ireland.
