Thomas Valpy French,  (born Jan. 1, 1825, Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, Eng.—died  May 14, 1891, Muscat, Arabia), first Anglican bishop of Lahore (now in Pakistan).
French was educated at Rugby School and University College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow in 1848. In 1850 he was accepted by the Church Missionary Society and sent to Agra, India, where he founded St. John’s College.
In 1877 French was appointed first bishop of Lahore, an immense diocese that included the whole of the Punjab and northwestern India. Though he was well meaning, his skill as an administrator was not outstanding, and in 1887 he resigned his see. In 1891, being deeply concerned about the almost total lack of Christian witness in Arabia, he decided to go at his own charge as a pioneer missionary to Muscat. His health already failing, he was unable to withstand the rigours of the Arabian climate; he died only a few months after his arrival in Muscat.
