Tadeusz Brzozowski,  (born Oct. 21, 1749, Malbork, Pol.—died  Feb. 5, 1820, Płock, Pol., Russian Empire), first general of the restored Society of Jesus.
In 1765 Brzozowski joined the Jesuits in Poland. He was ordained in Vilnius and taught in Minsk. In 1805, after serving 16 years as secretary and assistant to his predecessors, he was elected superior of the order, which had survived in Russian-annexed Poland and in Russia. When Pope Pius VII restored the Society of Jesus throughout the world in 1814, he conferred full powers on Brzozowski, making him the 19th general. During his generalate he witnessed the expulsion of the Jesuits from Russia (1815) but also their rapid restoration elsewhere in the world. Brzozowski translated into Polish the Dictionnaire philosophique de la religion (1782; “Philosophic Dictionary of Religion”) by Claude-Adrien Nonnotte.
