Dionysius The Areopagite,  (flourished  1st century ad), biblical figure, converted by St. Paul at Athens (Acts 17:34), who acquired a notable posthumous reputation primarily through confusion with later Christians similarly named. In the 2nd century he was held to have been the first bishop of Athens, and in the 9th century he was identified with St. Denis of France. In about 500, probably in Syria, some writings were forged in his name by a Christian Neoplatonist with moderate Monophysite leanings. These writings, whose author is often referred to as Pseudo-Dionysius, became of decisive importance for the theology and spirituality of Eastern Orthodoxy and Western Catholicism. (See also Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite).
