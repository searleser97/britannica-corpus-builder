Louis Bourdaloue,  (born Aug. 20, 1632, Bourges, France—died  May 13, 1704, Paris), French Jesuit, held by many to have been the greatest of the 17th-century court preachers.
Bourdaloue became a Jesuit in 1648 and very soon manifested his gift for oratory. After preaching in the provinces, he was sent in 1669 to Paris, where he preached in the Church of Saint Louis. He soon earned the title of “king of preachers and preacher of kings.” He was inevitably contrasted with his contemporary Bishop Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet. Bourdaloue always wrote out his sermons, which were careful logical expositions with insight into human nature. He never flattered his congregations but used his voice—praised by his contemporaries for its beauty—and personality to keep them spellbound. Bossuet, whose sermons depended to some extent on the stimulus of the occasion, has been called a lyrical preacher in contrast with Bourdaloue’s more carefully prepared dialectical expositions.
