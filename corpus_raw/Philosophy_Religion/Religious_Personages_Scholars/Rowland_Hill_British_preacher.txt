Rowland Hill,  (born Aug. 23, 1744, Hawkstone Park, Surrey, Eng.—died  April 11, 1833, London), English popular preacher and founder of the Surrey Chapel.
He was educated at Shrewsbury and Eton and at St. John’s College, Cambridge, where he was influenced by Methodism and gave open-air sermons despite opposition from the authorities. He was ordained curate of Kingston, Somerset, in 1773 but was refused priest’s orders. Having inherited property, he built for his own use Surrey Chapel, in Blackfriars Road, London, in 1783. Hill conducted his services in accordance with the forms of the Church of England, in whose communion he remained. Thirteen Sunday schools were attached to the chapel, and both there and on his tours of the countryside he attracted immense audiences.
Hill helped to found the Religious Tract Society, the British and Foreign Bible Society, and the London Missionary Society and was a stout advocate of vaccination. His best-known work is Village Dialogues (1801), which reached a 34th edition in 1839.
