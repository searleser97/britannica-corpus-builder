Matteo (serafini) Da Bascio, also called Matteo Di Bassi,  (born c. 1495, Bascio, Papal States [Italy]—died  Aug. 6, 1552, Venice), founder of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, commonly called Capuchins, the chief order of friars among the permanent offshoots of the Franciscans.
After entering the Observant Franciscans about 1511 at Montefalcone, Matteo was ordained priest about 1520. Eager to return to his order’s primitive simplicity of poverty as founded by St. Francis of Assisi, Matteo secretly left for Rome, where Pope Clement VII informally granted him permission to do so.
Convinced that the habit worn by the Franciscans was not the kind Francis had worn, he accordingly made himself a pointed, or pyramidal, hood; in addition, he grew a beard and traveled barefoot. Others followed his example, resulting in a recognized order (c. 1525). Their life approached Francis’ ideal as nearly as was practicable. On July 3, 1528, Clement, in his bull Religionis Zelus, gave the order canonical approbation. Matteo was elected first vicar general of the Capuchins in 1529 but soon resigned to continue his apostolic missionary work. He achieved the reputation of a great preacher, contributing especially to the Italian Catholic reformation.
In 1546 Pope Paul III dispatched Matteo to Germany to accompany the papal troops that assisted the Holy Roman emperor Charles V in his campaign against the Schmalkaldic League, a defensive organization of imperial Protestant estates in Germany. Charles declared war on John Frederick I, elector of Saxony. At the Battle of Mühlberg on April 24, 1547, Matteo reportedly spurred the Catholic soldiers to victory, and John Frederick was taken prisoner. Matteo returned to Venice, where he continued his preaching.
