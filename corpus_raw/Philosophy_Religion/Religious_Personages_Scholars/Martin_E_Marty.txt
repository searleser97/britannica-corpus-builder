Martin E. Marty, full name Martin Emil Marty,  (born Feb. 5, 1928, West Point, Neb., U.S.), American historian of religion best known as the author of numerous works that examined trends in religion in their broader historical and cultural contexts.
Marty studied at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Mo., receiving a B.A. in theology and church history (1949) and an M.A. in divinity (1952). Ordained in the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, he served as assistant pastor of a church in River Forest, Ill. (1952–56), while working toward an S.T.M. (Master in Sacred Theology) at Chicago’s Lutheran School of Theology (1954) and later on a doctorate in American religious and intellectual history at the University of Chicago (1956).
While serving as the founding pastor of a church in Elk Grove Village, Ill. (1957–63), he began his career in publishing, writing books on American religion and the history of Christianity and working for The Christian Century magazine, where he was a weekly columnist and later senior editor. He joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Divinity School in 1963 and taught there until his retirement in 1998.
In dozens of books and thousands of articles that were scholarly in content but also accessible to general readers, Marty examined contemporary religion against the institutional infighting and growing secularity of the 20th and 21st centuries. He wrote much on Protestantism but was also an authority on Roman Catholicism and other traditions. Marty wrote several primers of religious history, including A Short History of Christianity (1959), Pilgrims in Their Own Land: Five Hundred Years of Religion in America (1984), and A Short History of American Catholicism (1995). In 1972 he won a National Book Award for Righteous Empire: The Protestant Experience in America (1971), which described how Protestantism shaped early American culture and then, except for brief revivals, waned after the Civil War. His masterwork was Modern American Religion (1986–96), a three-volume study of the development of American religious life from the late 19th century. His study of religious pluralism in American life in the first decade of the 21st century, When Faiths Collide, was published in 2005.
In 1997 Marty was named director of the Public Religion Project (1996–98), a three-year study of religion’s relationship to American public life. In that same year he was awarded the National Humanities Medal and the inaugural Martin E. Marty Award in the Public Understanding of Religion. Though rarely acting in a political role, Marty also accepted in 1997 an appointment to head the Lutheran-Episcopalian Concordat, an ecumenical program almost 30 years in the making. In 1998, in honour of his 70th birthday and 35th year of service, the University of Chicago established the Martin Marty Center for the Advanced Study of Religion.
