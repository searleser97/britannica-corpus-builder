Folquet De Marseille, also called Foulques De Toulouse,  (born c. 1155, Marseille?, Provence [France]—died  Dec. 25, 1231, Toulouse), Provençal troubadour and cleric.
Born into a Genoese merchant family, Folquet left his life as a merchant to become a poet in about 1180. He was widely respected and successful throughout Provence and Aragon. His works, which include love lyrics (often dedicated to his patron’s wife), crusading songs, and religious poems, demonstrate a classical education and careful metrical forms. In 1195 Folquet, with his wife and children, entered a Cistercian abbey and renounced his love poetry. He became abbot and, in about 1205, bishop of Toulouse, in which capacity he engaged in persecuting the Albigensians and helped to found the University of Toulouse.
