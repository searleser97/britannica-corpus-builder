Harriet Starr Cannon,  (born May 7, 1823, Charleston, S.C., U.S.—died April 5, 1896, Peekskill, N.Y.), 19th-century American religious leader, a cofounder of the Community of St. Mary, an Episcopal sisterhood that focuses on child health and welfare.
Cannon was orphaned at age one and was reared by an aunt in Bridgeport, Connecticut. She attended local schools and studied music privately. In 1851 she moved to Brooklyn, New York, to be near her elder sister and supported herself by giving music lessons. The death of her sister in 1855 was a great loss, and in February 1856 she entered the Episcopal Sisterhood of the Holy Communion headed by Sister Anne Ayres. A year later Cannon became a full member, and in 1858 she was given charge of a hospital ward. Because of a growing disagreement with the rule of the order, she and four others left the sisterhood in 1863. They subsequently took charge of the House of Mercy, a rescue house and reformatory for young women; the Sheltering Arms orphanage; and St. Barnabas’ House for homeless women and children. The five women eventually founded the Community of St. Mary in 1865, the first women’s monastic order constituted by an Anglican bishop. Sister Harriet was elected first superior of the order, and she made her life vows in 1867. At first the order was met with widespread suspicion. Their very Roman Catholic-like rule caused their dismissal from St. Barnabas’ in 1867 and from Sheltering Arms in 1870. They made a success, however, of St. Mary’s School (1868) in New York City, St. Gabriel’s School (1872) in Peekskill, New York, and several other schools and missions.
