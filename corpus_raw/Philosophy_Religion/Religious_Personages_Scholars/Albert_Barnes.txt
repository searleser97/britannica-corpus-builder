Albert Barnes,  (born Dec. 1, 1798, Rome, N.Y., U.S.â€”died  Dec. 24, 1870, Philadelphia), U.S. Presbyterian clergyman and writer.
Of Methodist parentage, he intended to study law but, while at Hamilton College, decided to enter the Presbyterian ministry. He attended Princeton Theological Seminary and became a pastor in Morristown, N.J. In 1830 he moved to the First Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia. At that time he became involved in the controversy between Old School Presbyterians, who held to traditional doctrine, and those of the New School, who wished to relax it. For a year he was suspended from the ministry on charges that he departed from the doctrines of the Westminster Confession, but he was reinstated by the Assembly of 1836.
The rest of his career was devoted to pastoral work and to writing numerous books on the Scriptures and on theology and ethics. He stood strongly against slavery, arguing that the Bible condemned it. He also lent his support to the Prohibition movement, to the development of the Sunday school, and to the New School Presbyterians. He was a director of the Union Theological Seminary. In 1870 the first assembly of reunited Presbyterians was held in his church.
