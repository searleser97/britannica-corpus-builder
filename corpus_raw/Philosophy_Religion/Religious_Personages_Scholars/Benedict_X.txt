Benedict (X), original name Giovanni Mincio, Latin Johannes Mincius,  (died after 1073, Sant’Agnese, Italy), antipope from April 1058 to January 1059. His expulsion from the papal throne, on which he had been placed through the efforts of the powerful Tusculani family of Rome, was followed by a reform in the law governing papal elections. The new law, enacted in 1059, established an electoral body, which subsequently became the Sacred College of Cardinals, charged with sole responsibility for choosing the pope.
Benedict had previously been bishop of Velletri, near Rome, and seized the papacy upon the death of Pope Stephen IX (X). Expelled through the efforts of the reforming monk Hildebrand (later Pope St. Gregory VII) and the German court, he died a prisoner in the monastery of Sant’Agnese after 1073.
