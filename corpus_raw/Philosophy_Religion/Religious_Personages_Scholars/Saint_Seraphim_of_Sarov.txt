Saint Seraphim of Sarov, Russian Svyatoy Serafim Sarovsky,  original name Prokhor Moshnin,  (born July 19, 1759, Kursk, Russia—died  Jan. 2, 1833, Sarov Monastery, Tambov; canonized 1903; feast day January 2), Russian monk and mystic whose ascetic practice and counseling in cases of conscience won him the title starets (Russian: “spiritual teacher”). He is one of the most renowned monastic figures in Russian Orthodox history.
He took the religious name Seraphim on entering the Monastery of Sarov in 1777. After ordination to the priesthood in 1793, he withdrew as a solitary to a forest hut near the monastery. After 25 years as a hermit he returned to an active, pastoral ministry in Sarov in 1815, following the direction indicated by a spiritual experience that Seraphim attributed to the Virgin Mary. He served as confessor to a number of the surrounding faithful and to pilgrims and was reputed to work some wonders, including the discernment of thoughts and conscience.
Seraphim’s spiritual doctrine centred on a program of contemplative prayer directed toward mystical experience. He was original in extending to laypersons the traditional monastic method of contemplation, which included self-denial to combat vices and meditative methods toward ecstatic prayer. Seraphim maintained that prayer was not limited to the cloistered mystic but was within the capacity of any Christian. He was acclaimed a saint by the Russian Orthodox church in 1903 and proposed as a standard for spirituality.
