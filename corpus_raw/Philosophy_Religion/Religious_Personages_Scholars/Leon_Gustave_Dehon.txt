Léon-Gustave Dehon, byname John Of The Heart Of Jesus,  French Jean Du Coeur De Jésus,  (born March 14, 1843, La Capelle-en-Thiérache, France—died  Aug. 12, 1925, Brussels, Belg.), French Roman Catholic priest who founded the Congregation of the Priests of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a congregation of priests and brothers dedicated to spreading the apostolate of the Sacred Heart.
Educated at the Sorbonne, Dehon was ordained priest in 1868 at Rome. After attending the first Vatican Council (1869–70), he returned to France, where, at Saint-Quentin, he became curate (1871). Thereafter, he engaged in social work until 1877, when he founded his diocesan congregation as the Oblates of the Sacred Heart.
Dehon’s congregation was recognized in 1883, under its present name, by Pope Leo XIII. In 1886 Dehon was elected the congregation’s first superior general, an office he held for life. In 1906 Dehon transferred his congregation’s motherhouse to Brussels. Pope Benedict XV gave the Priests of the Sacred Heart their final approbation in 1923. The congregation spread to five continents and to several states in the United States.
