Saint Catherine of Sweden, Swedish Sankta Katarina,  original name Katarina Ulfsdotter,  (born 1331/32, Sweden—died  March 24, 1381, Vadstena; feast day March 24), daughter of St. Bridget of Sweden, whom she succeeded as superior of the Brigittines.
Catherine was married to Egard Lydersson von Kyren, who died shortly after she left for Rome (1350) to join Bridget as her constant companion. She did not return to Sweden until after Bridget’s death in 1373. She took part in the ecclesiastical controversies of her time, supported Pope Urban VI against the antipope Clement VII, and promoted the canonization of Bridget. She was abbess of Vadstena when she died. She was never formally canonized but is listed in the Roman martyrology.
